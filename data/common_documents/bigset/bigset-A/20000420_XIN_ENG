ISLAMABAD, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Afghanistan's ruling Taliban
militia Wednesday announced the closure of "open market" in
capital Kabul for "some period" in a bid to stabilize the
depreciating Afghan currency, Afghan Islamic Press (AIP) reported.
</P>
<P>
The decision was taken when the Afghani fell to all-time low.
On Wednesday, one U.S. dollar was being changed for 75,000
Afghanis in Kabul's Sara-e-Shahzada market, forcing the Taliban
authorities to halt the business.
</P>
<P>
AIP said the Islamic militia also banned carrying Afghani from
opposition-held northern Afghanistan and from neighboring
countries into Taliban-controlled areas.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted an unnamed Taliban official as accusing the
opposition of having been pouring in billions of fake Afghanis
into Taliban-ruled areas to destabilize the currency.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Supports Peaceful Solution to Cyprus Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Egypt Backs a peaceful solution to
the Cyprus issue, which is based on the U.N. resolutions, Egyptian
Ambassador to Cyprus Omar Metwally said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Metwally told the Cyprus News Agency that Egypt is "looking
forward to the day when Cyprus will be reunited as one country with
one international personality."
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus solution, he said, should also be acceptable to both
the Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkish troops took
over the northern third of the island in reaction to a pro-Athens
coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has been trying for decades to reunite the
island through a bizonal, bicommunal federation formula, but so far
no tangible results have been achieved.
</P>
<P>
Metwally described the relations between Egypt and Cyprus,
especially in the political field, as "excellent and close", adding
that they could be further boosted in the economic and the cultural
fields.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Metwally announced that an Egyptian Cultural Week and
Film Festival will be held in Nicosia on May 5-18, which will be
featured by movies, traditional folkloric dancing and contemporary
Egyptian art.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISTANBUL, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
said here Thursday that China would like to join hands with Turkey
to promote the bilateral relations on various levels.
</P>
<P>
China believes that fruitful results will be achieved in its
friendly cooperation with Turkey in the new century after the two
countries forged a new type of partnership, he said at a banquet
hosted by Governor of Istanbul Erol Gakir in his honor.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president arrived in this largest city of Turkey in
the morning from the Turkish capital of Ankara to continue his
state visit in the country.
</P>
<P>
At the banquet, Jiang termed Istanbul, which straddles the Asian
and European continents, as a city of charm and a golden bridge
linking the East and West.
</P>
<P>
He said that the economic progress and vitality of the city have
deeply impressed him.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also spoke highly of the role the city has played in the
Sino-Turkish friendship, noting that the ancient Silk Road extended
from then China's capital Xi'an to Istanbul.
</P>
<P>
Gakir extended his warm welcome to Jiang, saying that Jiang's
visit has written a new chapter in the history of the development
of the bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
As a world-known historic and cultural city and an economic
center, Istanbul will play a significant role in furthering the
Turkey-China relations, Gakir added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, President Jiang toured an electronic
facility manufacturing company in the city. Together with his
Turkish counterpart Suleyman Demirel, Jiang also met with Turkish
businessmen.
</P>
<P>
Jiang arrived in Turkey Tuesday for a state visit as the guest
of Demirel. This is the third leg of his five-nation visit, which
had taken him to Israel and Palestine, and will take him to Greece
and South Africa.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian, Lebanese Presidents Discuss Mideast Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
discussed on Thursday with visiting Lebanese President Emile Lahoud
the Middle East peace process, particularly Israel's plan to
withdraw from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"The two leaders underscored the necessity that the (Israeli)
withdrawal be carried out in line with (the United Nations Security
Council) resolution 425," Egyptian Information Minister Safwat el-
Sharif told reporters after a one-on-one meeting between Mubarak
and Lahoud.
</P>
<P>
"The two presidents also stressed the necessity of respecting
Lebanon's territorial waters, airspace and sovereignty over the
whole Lebanese national land," el-Sharif said.
</P>
<P>
Israel invaded Lebanon in 1978 and set up a self-proclaimed
security zone in south Lebanon in 1985 with the excuse to protect
its northern areas from cross-border guerrilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Israel formally notified United Nations Secretary
General Kofi Annan that it will withdraw from Lebanon by July under
the U.N. Security Council resolutions 425 and 426, even without an
agreement with Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak and Lahoud also reviewed the Syrian-Israeli and
Palestinian-Israeli peace talks, el-Sharif said. They reiterated
the importance of complying with the land-for-peace principle, the
relevant U.N. Security Council resolutions and the internationally
recognized borders of Lebanon and Syria.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak and Lahoud urged the Palestinians and Israel to push
forward their negotiations, reiterating that resolving the
Palestinian problem holds the key to a comprehensive, durable and
just peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
Lahoud arrived here earlier in the day for a two-day visit, his
first since assuming power in 1998.

Washington to discuss bilateral relationship as well as issues for
July's G8 summit in Okinawa, the White House said on Thursday.
</P>

that define our relationship, I expect there to be discussion of

Germany, Italy, Japan, the United States and Russia, is scheduled
from July 21-23 on the southern island of Okinawa.

<HEADLINE> Brazilian Economy to Grow over 4 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, April 20 (Xinhua) -- The Brazilian government is
expecting an average real growth of the national economy above
four percent in the next three years, said Thursday Finance
Minister Pedro Malan.
</P>
<P>
Malan told Radiobras that Brazil has a very concrete
possibility of combining a sustainable growth with a dropping
inflation, that will reach six percent this year and four percent
the next.
</P>
<P>
He said that this sustainable growth of the economy will favor
the creation of jobs, as well as a bigger expansion of consuming,
sales, investments and exports.
</P>
<P>
Malan said that this target will be reached unless there is a
big international disaster or that the country goes through a big
mistake.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the interest rate, he said that it will be shrinking
in the next months and even years, explaining that the drop of the
rates depends on the evolution of the international domestic
economic situation.
</P>
<P>
The minister refused to forecast a figure for trade surplus of
this year, alleging that he is concerned with the trend and the
direction, not with figures.
</P>
<P>
He said that the devaluation of the real, the Brazilian
currency, has "long term effects" in the rise of exports and in
the Brazilian domestic production.

<HEADLINE> Nicaragua Exports Cheap, Qualified Labor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Nicaragua has become a country
that exports cheap qualified labor to other nations, said Thursday
a Nicaraguan Non-Government Organizations (NGO) study.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that from 800,000 to 1.2 million Nicaraguan
have gone o Costa Rica and to the United States. A 43 percent of
the Nicaraguan women who are working as domestic laborers in Costa
Rica are teachers.
</P>
<P>
The emigration of Nicaraguan professionals to other countries
is a constant feature caused by the high indexes of poverty
existing in the country, says the NGO document.
</P>
<P>
A poll made by the Nicaraguan Research Institute between
February 24 and March 2 of this year shows that the living
standards deterioration of Nicaraguans has risen in the last years.
</P>
<P>
Eighty-eight percent of the Nicaraguan population lives in
poverty and lacks many basic services. These levels of poverty
force many Nicaraguans to seek between horizons, said the NGO
study.

<P>
The belligerent parties to the conflict in the DRC adopted the
plan on April 8 to disengage their forces from their current
confrontation lines.
</P>
<P>
In his latest report to the U.N. Security Council, Annan said
the U.N. Secretariat will continue actively to carry out the
logistical preparations for the deployment of the U.N. Mission in
the DRC (MONUC), mandated to monitor the cease-fire process there.
</P>
<P>
The mission would do everything it can to assist the parties to
finalize their disengagement plan, Annan said.
</P>
<P>
In February, the U.N. Security Council authorized the expansion
of the MONUC to 5,537 military personnel from the current 100
unarmed military liaison officers.
</P>
<P>
The MONUC also lacks some crucial units including airfield
crash rescue and firefighting, air traffic control, cargo handling
and water processing.

<HEADLINE> British, Irish PMs Cautiously Optimistic on N.Ireland Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 20 (Xinhua) -- The British and Irish prime
ministers Thursday cautiously expressed "confidence" over
achieving a breakthrough in the stalled Northern Ireland peace
process.
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister Tony Blair and Irish Premier Bertie
Ahern said they saw a glimmer of progress in the peace process but
admitted they had yet to achieve a breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
Emerging from Downing Street after two hours of talks with Tony
Blair, Ahern said that while there had been "some progress" in
discussions, there had not been any "fundamental breakthrough."
</P>
<P>
"Cooperation between the British and Irish governments is
excellent. It does give me confidence. On the other side of Easter,
we can make progress," Ahern said.
</P>
<P>
But he admitted that it was "not going to be easy."
</P>
<P>
"We don't have a simple resolution," Ahern said.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's meeting was the second in three days between the two
leaders. It came as the Irish Republic Army (IRA) issued its
Easter message that it wanted a "permanent peace" but that the
British government was still prosecuting a "war" against
republicans.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to Belfast earlier this week, Blair met
representatives of all the main parties and described discussions
as "good and constructive." But he warned against false
expectations of an imminent breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
"There are possibilities, but it is important we don't raise
people's expectations too highly before we have really been able
to explore what those possibilities might be," Blair said.
</P>
<P>
Many people in Northern Ireland see the next few weeks as make-
or-break for the British province's landmark Good Friday peace
accord, signed about two years ago.
</P>
<P>
The 1998 pact envisaged complete disarmament of the IRA by May
22 this year. Some analysts said its credibility will be ripped to
shreds if not one gun is handed over by that date.
</P>
<P>
Britain suspended Belfast's fledgling home-rule joint
government in February because it said the IRA had shown no
commitment to disarm.

<HEADLINE> Albright Meets with Arafat on Israeli-Palestinian Negotiations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 20 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright held talks on Thursday with Palestinian
President Yasser Arafat over the virtually stalled Israeli-
Palestinian peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Albright met Arafat over lunch at her Georgetown residence. The
contents of their discussions were not disclosed but State
Department spokesman James Rubin said that the United States was
prepared to play a more active role in the Israeli-Palestinian
negotiations as the September deadline for a final status
agreement was drawing nearer.
</P>
<P>
"Everyone agreed that we will play a more involved role by
being at the table, trying to be creative, trying to help each
side figure out what its needs are," Rubin told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said
President Bill Clinton wanted to use the face-to-face talks to
make sure what Washington could do to help Israeli-Palestinian
negotiations move toward a framework agreement and then a final
status agreement.
</P>
<P>
"I think the president thought it would be useful and effective
to use this time to meet directly to see what we can do to keep
these (talks) on track," he said.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Clinton held talks with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak to try to renew momentum in the negotiations between Israel
and the Palestinians as the target date for a framework agreement
in May is drawing nearer while gaps still remained wide between
the two parties.
</P>
<P>
Lockhart said both Israel and the Palestinians were facing very
difficult issues, saying that "they have a very tight time line."
</P>
<P>
The second round of Bolling Air Force Base negotiations between
Israeli and Palestinian delegations ended last weekend with an
exchange of position papers on the framework agreement but no
evidence of substantial progress.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials say that Washington is trying to help bridge the
gaps but it has not reached the stage of proposing compromises.
</P>
<P>
Arafat said on Monday that he would take some "positive ideas"
to the White House, and considered his trip to Washington "a
crucial and basic step to push the peace process forward."
</P>
<P>
Palestinian cabinet minister Hassan Asfour on Tuesday held out
little hope for a breakthrough when Arafat meets Clinton.
</P>
<P>
"We have nothing new to add." he said. "There is no place for
more flexibility. We were the party which made a historical
concession in 1993 and not the Israelis."
</P>
<P>
1993 was the year of the Oslo accords between Israel and the
PLO.

<HEADLINE> One Third of Ethiopian Cattle Population Die Every Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Some 34 percent of cattle
population in Ethiopia died of animal diseases annually though the
government exerted efforts to stem spread of animal diseases, Vice
Minister of Agriculture Belay Ejigu said here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Belay told a workshop on animal disease control and vaccination
that the government has attached a paramount importance to
ensuring quarantine and surveillance system along with
strengthening the capacity of veterinary clinics and institutions
with a view to controlling and eventually eradicating animal
disease in general and rinderpest in particular from the country,
he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Belay, Ethiopia's National Veterinary Institute
has a capacity to produce 50 to 80 million doses of vaccines
annually for the prevention of various communicable and
non-communicable animal diseases.

<HEADLINE> Rwandan Genocide Suspect Pleads Not Guilty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Jean Bosco Barayagwiza, a key
genocide suspect, has refused to plead guilty or not guilty to the
charges brought against him by the prosecutor at the International
Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) based in the northern
Tanzanian town of Arusha.
</P>
<P>
According to Rwanda News Agency on Thursday, Barayagwiza,
former director of political affairs in Rwandan foreign ministry
and one of the founders of the extremist Radio Television Libre
des Mille Collines (RTLM), was accused of genocide, crimes against
humanity and serious violation of the Geneva Conventions.
</P>
<P>
Barayagwiza also refused on Wednesday to cooperate with the
defense counsel, assigned to him by the Tribunal.
</P>
<P>
Despite his objections, the presiding judge Navanthem Pilly
entered a plea of not guilty to each of the three counts.
</P>
<P>
Upon the ICTR Chief Prosecutor's request, the Appeals Chamber
reversed its earlier decision to release Barayagwiza on procedural
grounds.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, a joint trial of ring leaders of the
Rwandan hate media campaign is scheduled to start on June 5 at
the ICTR and the accused include Ferdinand Nahimana, former
director of RTLM , Ngeze Hassan, former editor of the extremist
Kangura News Paper and Jean Bosco Barayagwiza.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese President in Cairo for Talks With Mubarak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese President Emile Lahoud
arrived in Cairo Thursday on a two-day visit for talks with his
Egyptian counterpart Hosni Mubarak mainly on the latest development
of the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Lahoud was greeted at Cairo International Airport by Mubarak,
Egyptian Prime Minister Atef Obeid and a number of Egyptian
ministers.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents later went into a one-on-one meeting. The
details of their talks were not immediately available. But the
meeting was expected to cover, in particular, the Israel's decision
to pull out of south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel invaded Lebanon in 1978 and set up a security zone in
south Lebanon in 1985 with a self-proclaimed aim of protecting its
northern areas from cross-border guerrilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Israel formally notified United Nations Secretary
General Kofi Annan that it will withdraw from Lebanon by July under
the U.N. Security Council resolutions 425 and 426, even without an
agreement with Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Lahoud will meet Arab League Secretary General Esmat Abdel-
Meguid here on Friday morning.

<HEADLINE> Resumption of Syrian-Israeli Talks Still Possible: EU Envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, April 20 (Xinhua) -- European Union (EU) Mideast
special
envoy Miguel Moratinos said here Thursday that there is still a
chance to revive the Syrian-Israeli peace talks that have been
stalled since January 10.
</P>
<P>
"Although the road to the Syrian-Israeli peace is not smooth, I
believe there is still a chance to resume the talks. We must find a
way of reviving the talks," Moratinos told reporters after meeting
Syrian Foreign Minister Faruk Shareh.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that he felt a real desire to resume the talks
during his meetings with Syrian, Israeli and U.S. officials. "There
are some points that need to be clarified before the resumption but

we hope that this will be done soon," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian-Israeli talks were resumed in Washington in
December, 1999, after a four-year freeze but entered a blind alley
on
January 10 due to the disputes over the Golan Heights, water
resources and security issues.
</P>
<P>
Moratinos termed his talks with Shareh as successful and
fruitful. He said he conveyed to the Syrian official the EU
commitment to help the concerned parties establish a just,
comprehensive and lasting peace in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
The differences between Syria and Israel focus mainly on the
issue of Tiberias Lake as the former wants to restore sovereignty
over the northeastern coast of the lake in line with the borders of
June 4, 1967, while the latter claims full sovereignty over the
lake.
</P>
<P>
However, there are some proposals of launching joint tourist
projects between the two countries around the lake or declaring it
a natural reserve and permitting access to it by the two peoples.
</P>
<P>
The EU envoy arrived here Thursday morning on a short visit to
Syria.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Finds Greco-Roman Fortress in Desert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 20 (Xinhua) -- French and Egyptian archaeologists
have found the remains of a Greco-Roman fortress town built along
an ancient caravan route in the Egyptian desert, a senior
antiquities official said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The site was discovered on the ancient route linking Qaft, near
the Nile south of Cairo, and Berenice, further southeast near the
Red Sea, said Mohammed al-Saghir, director-general of the Southern
Sector of Egypt's Supreme Council of Antiquities.
</P>
<P>
The team also found nearby a small stone temple, a collection of
bronze coins, the head of a statue, and pottery shards, as well as
tablets bearing Greek inscriptions from private letters or legal
documents, Egypt's Middle East News Agency quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
The temple walls contain Greek inscriptions painted in red, he
added.
</P>
<P>
"The papyrus, textiles and leather found at the site prove the
town and fortress were busy because on the one hand they served the
caravans and on the other they profited from the eastern desert's
mines and quarries," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The remains that were discovered show the precision and sense
of order of the town which was among 13 others built on this
route," he said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Embassy in Khartoum Reopened after 2-Year Closure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, April 20 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Embassy in Khartoum
resumed its function with the arrival of Charge D'Affaires Donald
Titlbom here from Nairobi last Saturday after a two-year
suspension,
the Sudanese News Agency (SNA) reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Consul Donald Mulligan will arrive here from Cairo early
next week and an administrative attache is due to arrive here from
Nairobi, capital of Kenya, soon, SNA added.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese Foreign Ministry issued visas to the three U.S.
diplomats recently.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. official will administer some diplomatic and
administrative functions such as issuing U.S. visas to Sudanese
nationals who should, in the past, travel to Egypt first to get the
visas, SNA noted.
</P>
<P>
In February 1996, Washington closed its embassy in Khartoum
and moved its staff to Nairobi as a result of the U.N. imposed
sanctions on Sudan due to the latter's refusal to extradite the
suspects of an attempt on Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's life
in
1995.
</P>
<P>
In September, 1997, Washington sent the staff back to Khartoum.
However, the diplomatic activity was suspended anew in August
1998, after the double bomb attacks against U.S. embassies in
Nairobi and Dar El-Salam which claimed 224 lives including 12 U.S.
nationals.

DUBLIN, Ireland, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Irish President Mary
McAleese met with visiting Chinese Vice Premier Li Lanqing at the
Presidential Palace here Thursday and they discussed ways to
promote bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese vice premier conveyed Chinese President Jiang Zemin
's regards to the Irish president and expressed his admiration to
the Irish people's contribution to world civilization.
</P>
<P>
Li said Ireland has registered a rapid economic growth rate in
recent years and has become the largest software exporter in the
world.

The Chinese government attaches great importance to developing
its relations with Ireland and is willing to strengthen an all-
round cooperation with the island country, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Irish president expressed her warm welcome to the Chinese
vice premier's visit. She said although Ireland and China are
located far apart from each other on the Eurasia Continent, the
distance and the difference in languages cannot obstruct the
friendship between the peoples of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
She noted that China has made remarkable achievements in its
reform and opening up and the Irish government is willing to
expand its cooperation with China in various fields. She said she
believes the Chinese vice premier's current visit here would push
foreword the development of bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese vice premier, who arrived here on Tuesday for a
four-day official visit, is expected to conclude his visit on

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 20 (Xinhua) -- The 2000 Review Conference
of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear
Weapons(NPT) will meet at the United Nations in New York from
April 24 to May 19, 2000.
</P>
<P>
The previsions of the Treaty, which opened for signature in
1968 and went into force in 1970, envisage a review of the
operation of the Treaty every five years.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the press, Jayantha Dhanapala, U.N.Under-Secretary-
General for the Disarmament Affairs, said "The treaty is the most
important legal instrument in the area of disarmament. It is
commonly acknowledged to be the cornerstone of the nuclear non-
proliferation regime."
</P>
<P>
"This particular conference is more significant because not
only the first in the 21st century, but it is the first in the
strengthened review process that was inaugurated in 1995,' he said.
</P>
<P>
The 2000 Review Conference is the first to meet following the
Treaty's indefinite extension at the 1995 Conference.
</P>
<P>
States Parties will examine the implementation of the Treaty's
provisions since 1995, taking into account the decisions on the
principles and objectives for nuclear non-proliferation and
disarmament and the strengthening of the review process for the
Treaty as well as the resolution on the resolution on the Middle
East adopted at the 1995 Conference.
</P>
<P>
The NPT is a landmark international treaty whose objective is
to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and weapons technology,
to promote cooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and
to further the goal of achieving nuclear disarmament and general
and complete disarmament.
</P>
<P>
By January 2000, a total of 187 parties had joined the treaty.

<HEADLINE> EAC Committed to Regional Economic Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 20 (Xinhua) -- The main task of the
re-launched East African Community (EAC) is to stimulate economic
growth and alleviate poverty in the region, the outgoing chairman
of the permanent tripartite commission Eriya Ketegaya of Uganda
said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the commission's 15th meeting held in Tanzania's
northern town of Arusha, where the secretariat of the regional
bloc is located, the chairman said the objective should be a
historical mission and the new community offers the best
opportunity to realize it.
</P>
<P>
The EAC focus should be in directing energies in uplifting the
standards of poor people in the region, stressed Ketegaya when
handing over the annual rotating tripartite chairmanship to
Kenya's Minister for Tourism, Trade and Industry Nicholas Biwott.
</P>
<P>
Ketegaya, who is also Uganda's First Deputy Prime Minister and
Minister for Foreign Affairs, also asked the EAC to address
concerns of low levels of investment and production as well as the
inadequate infrastructure development in the three member
countries of Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
"Low levels of domestic and foreign investment in the region
continues to hamper the stimulation of our economies to the
desired level," he added.
</P>
<P>
Ketegaya also underlined special importance of involving the
private sector in the EAC integration process, saying that "they
are indispensable partners in the process, they will constitute a
major factor in the region' s economic growth and development."
</P>
<P>
On program implementation, the Uganda Deputy Prime Minister
exhorted member states to select a list of priority programs to be
realized within a time frame.
</P>
<P>
"This is because any attempt to implement all the provisions of
the treaty may prove counter-productive," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We should bear in mind the resource constraints and our desire
to move steadily and surely."
</P>
<P>
Leaders of Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania signed a treaty last
November forming an East African economic bloc, reviving a
regional coalition that collapsed 22 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The new treaty recreates the former regional East African
Community, renaming it the East African Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The former bloc collapsed in 1977, partly because of a
divergence of economic policies carried out in the three
countries.
</P>
<P>
Today, they are all pursuing free market economies and policies
of privatization, factors they hope will contribute to success
this time around.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Appeals to EU for Lifting Ban on Fish Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Uganda has appealed to the
European Union (EU) for lifting the year-long ban on its fish
exports to the international market because they are now safe for
human consumption, Radio Uganda reported here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Uganda is committed to the quality and safety of its fish for
local and international markets, said Fred Mukisa, minister of
state for fisheries, when discussing with EU ambassadors
accredited to Uganda on the process of its re-entry into the
international market.
</P>
<P>
Mukisa lamented the sharp decline of foreign exchange earnings
due to the tough ban, saying that it also affected some 700,000
people who depend on fishing for their living.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted French Ambassador Rene Roudaut as saying that
the fish ban would soon be lifted because of the steps the
Ugandan government has taken to ensure safe fish products.
</P>
<P>
EU, the largest destination of Ugandan fish exports, slashed a
ban on Uganda's fish products in early 1999, which costs the
country almost one million U.S. dollars a week. The fish export
is the second largest foreign exchange earner of the country
following coffee, accounting for about eight percent of its total
exports.

LAGOS, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Ghana on Thursday urged
stakeholders in the African health sector to fight against malaria
 which causes more than one million deaths annually in Africa,
Ghana News Agency said.
</P>
<P>
"Malaria is more than a health issue and the inaction of other
sectors may increase the burden of the disease," Ghana's minister
of health, Kwaku Danso said in Ghana's capital Accra at a press
briefing on the first African summit on malaria scheduled to be
held in Nigeria on April 25.
</P>
<P>
The summit is co-sponsored by Nigerian President Olusegun
Obasanjo and the World Health Organization (WHO).
</P>
<P>
WHO coordinates the global partnership Roll Back Malaria
Initiative that is aimed at halving the number of malaria deaths
by the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
More than 50 African Heads of State, Group 8 Heads of State,
the heads of 10 international development agencies have been
invited to the Summit.
</P>
<P>
In Ghana, the disease accounts for more than 40 percent of the
Out- Patient Department cases in health institutions.
</P>
<P>
Danso recalled several attempts to control the disease in the
past, including the vector control, but which could not be
sustained due to technical difficulties, lack of funding and
little collaboration with other sectors.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique Sets Economic Targets for 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, April 20 (Xinhua) -- The top priorities of the
Mozambican government's economic and social plan for the year 2000
are to eliminate absolute poverty, reduce regional imbalances and
develop the business class, Prime Minister Pascoal Mocumbi
declared on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Outlining the plan to the country's parliament, he said that
the key targets are to achieve a growth rate of between six and
eight percent, and an inflation rate of between eight and ten
percent, to continue establishing conditions for attracting
investments, and to improve the quality of public services.
</P>
<P>
The plan expects an 11.7 percent growth in agriculture, but it
is far from clear how this can now be achieved, given the
devastating floods in five southern and central provinces.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Leader Reiterates Support for Lebanon against Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah
Ali Khamenei on Thursday reiterated Tehran's support for Lebanon
and the Lebanese resistance movement in their struggles against
Israel.
</P>
<P>
Receiving Lebanese President Emile Lahoud, Khamenei said that as
long as the threat of Israel remains, the necessity for resistance
is felt, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Lahoud briefed Khamenei of the withdrawal of the Israeli forces
from southern Lebanon and said his visit to Iran was aimed at
thanking the Iranian nation for their support to Lebanon in its
campaign against the Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
At the end of Lahoud's three-day official visit, Iran and
Lebanon released a joint statement, condemning Israeli occupation
of southern Lebanon and underlining struggles against Israelis
until the emancipation of the Lebanese territories.
</P>
<P>
The statement lauded the Lebanese resistance and termed the
planned Israeli withdrawal from southern Lebanon as a victory for
the Arab and Muslim world.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also highlighted the need for a stable and lasting
peace in the region and called for attention to the danger posed by
Israel's nuclear arsenal for the regional countries.
</P>
<P>
The statement urged to protect the Middle East from nuclear
weapons and weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
The two countries also called for expansion of the bilateral
relations especially in the economic and cultural areas.

<TEXT>
<P>
TUNIS, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Tunisian Prime Minister Mohamed
Ghannouchi met here Thursday with a visiting U.S. Congress
delegation headed by Democratic deputy James Moran of Virginia
state.
</P>
<P>
The meeting dealt with the economic potentials of Tunisia in the
light of desire of the United States and Europe to expand
investment in the country, Moran told reporters after the talks.
</P>
<P>
"The political stability in Tunisia is one of the major
attraction factors for U.S. and European investors," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that Tunisia has so many potentials and resources
that it could be the economic and cultural door of Africa and the
Middle East," he added.
</P>
<P>
On the Middle East peace process, the U.S. congressman
underscored Tunisia's role as "a voice of moderation and
progress." "This is one of the major reasons for our visit to
Tunisia," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The delegation includes Democratic deputies of New York, Morris
Hinky and Caran Mccarty, and Chief of the Centre of Economic
Cooperation and Peace Process, Ann Oranis.
</P>
<P>
The delegation also held talks with President of the National
Assembly (parliament) of Tunisia, Fouad Mbazaa, on the bilateral
ties and the Middle East peace process.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Arrives in Washington For Talks with U.S. Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian President Yasser
Arafat arrived in Washington on Thursday and started talks with U.
S. leaders to discuss how to push the virtually stalled Israeli-
Palestinian peace talks forward.
</P>
<P>
Arafat first met with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright at
her Georgetown home and will go to the White House to meet
President Bill Clinton in the evening.
</P>
<P>
"The president wanted to use this opportunity in this period to
talk directly, face-to-face with the leaders, to make sure that we
are doing everything that we can to help the parties move toward a
final agreement," said White house spokesman Joe Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Clinton held talks with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak to try to renew momentum in the negotiations between Israel
and the Palestinians as the target date for a framework agreement
in May drawing nearer while gaps still remained wide between the
two parties.
</P>
<P>
The second round of Bolling Air Force Base negotiations between
Israeli and the Palestinian delegations ended last weekend with an
exchange of position papers on the framework agreement but no
evidence of substantial progress.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials say that Washington is trying to help bridge the
gaps but it has not reached the stage of proposing compromises.
</P>
<P>
Arafat said on Monday that he would take some "positive ideas"
to the White House, and considered his trip to Washington "a
crucial and basic step to push the peace process forward."
</P>
<P>
Palestinian cabinet minister Hassan Asfour on Tuesday held out
little hope for a breakthrough when Arafat meet Clinton.
</P>
<P>
"We have nothing new to add,: he said. "There is no place for
more flexibility. We were the party which made a historical
concession in 1993 and not the Israelis."
</P>
<P>
1993 was the year of the Oslo accords between Israel and the
PLO.

<HEADLINE> S. African Farm Attacks Not Related to Zimbabwean Land Invasions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 20 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Safety and
Security said on Thursday the recent increase in the number of
farm attacks in South Africa was totally not related to the farm
invasions in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Andre Martins, spokesman for minister Steve Tshwete, said the
government and the national agricultural union, Agriculture SA
(South Africa), were working closely together to address the issue
of farm attacks.
</P>
<P>
"From a law enforcement perspective, if any form of
Zimbabwean-style farm invasions did take place in South Africa,
police would have to act. At the same time we must also remember
that our government has a land restitution process in place,"
Martins said.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean war veterans and squatters have been invading
white-owned farms since February, despite the high court order to
evict them from the land.
</P>
<P>
A number of farm attacks have occurred in South Africa in the
last few days, sparking fear that South Africa would undergo the
same situation in Zimbabwe.

<HEADLINE> New Oil Well Discovered in Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, April 20 (Xinhua) -- French oil company ELF Exploration
Angola has succeeded in sinking a new oil well in the offshore oil
field in Angola, the Angolan state oil company SONANGOL said here
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Named as "Jasmin-1", the newly found oil well is located some
200 kilometers from the Angolan capital Luanda, with an estimated
daily production of 10,800 barrels.
</P>
<P>
However, the two oil companies said, further geological and
engineering studies will be carried out to establish the real
capacity of the well.
</P>
<P>
The new well, drilled 1,392 meters deep, is the ninth
consecutive discovery in the Angolan deep water field block 17.
</P>
<P>
Other wells discovered on the block 17 are"Girassol", "Dalia",
"Rosa", " Lirio", "Tulipa","Orquidea", "Cravo" and "Camelia",
which are all named after flowers.
</P>
<P>
"ELF Exploration Angola" holds 35 percent of the block 17 while
the rest are shared by "ESSO Exploration Angola" ,"BP" "Statoil"
and other companies.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan government divides its offshore waters into several
"blocks" for the exploration of oil. The foreign oil companies
have to bid against each other for the authority of the
exploration in the blocks.

<HEADLINE> Mozambican Prime Minister on successes in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Mozambique enjoyed "a positive
performance on all the fronts regarded as fundamental for the
country's social and political life" last year, Prime Minister
Pascoal Mocumbi told the country' s parliament, the Assembly of
the Republic, on thursday.
</P>
<P>
Summarizing achievements in 1999, he said that Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) grew by nine percent, and commodity exports rose by
six percent.
</P>
<P>
Averaged over the year, inflation was only two per cent.
However, in year-on-year terms by the end of December it reached
4.8 per cent.
</P>
<P>
The Mozambican currency, the metical, devalued by about eight
per cent. This was a considerably higher devaluation than in 1998,
but Mocumbi argued that it was necessary to maintain the
competitiveness of the Mozambican economy.
</P>
<P>
He said that total investment financed with outside resources
(either direct foreign investment, or the contracting of private
foreign loans) reached 742 million U.S. dollars in 1999, as
against only 292 million U.S. dollars in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said budgetary policy "achieved its aims,
notably the expansion of public expenditure in a framework of
controlled inflation".
</P>
<P>
Total expenditure increased, in nominal terms, by 23 percent.
Domestic revenue rose by 17 percent, and foreign grants and loans
by nine percent.
</P>
<P>
The increase in spending was channelled mostly to "priority
sectors". Thus there was a 27 percent increase in spending on
education, a 32 percent increase in health, and a 44 percent
increase in the justice system.
</P>
<P>
Mocumbi also stressed the debt relief Mozambique received in
1999. At the end of June Mozambique finally reached the
"completion point" for HIPC (Heavily Indebted poor Countries) debt
relief.
</P>
<P>
This wiped out 3.7 billion U.S. dollars of Mozambique's debt
stock in nominal terms (1.7 billion U.S. dollars in present net
value).
</P>
<P>
This improved the balance of payments, and released funds for
poverty reduction programs that would otherwise have been spent on
debt servicing.
</P>
<P>
Annual debt servicing fell from 2.1 percent of GDP in 1998 to
1.7 percent in 1999, Mocumbi said.

<HEADLINE> Zambian President Confirms Ceasefire in Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba confirmed on Thursday that fighting in the Democratic
Republic of the Congo (DRC) had ceased after all parties concerned
adopted a disengagement plan two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
At a press briefing at the State House here, he gave an account
of the latest developments regarding the implementation of the
Lusaka Cease-fire Agreement signed last July.
</P>
<P>
The president disclosed that arrangements were already underway
for the establishment of an office in the DRC capital Kinshasa for
former Botswana President Ketumile Masire, who is now official
facilitator of the inter- Congolese political negotiations under
the Southern African Development Community (SADC).
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said Masire had already sent a special envoy to
Kinshasa to arrange for his visit to that country prior to the
holding of crucial inter- Congolese national dialogue.
</P>
<P>
He also revealed that countries that had sent troops to the DRC
had already begun the release and exchange of prisoners of war and
hostages.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba thanked Senegal and Pakistan for providing battalions
to the 5,500-strong United Nations military observer force and he
called on other countries to emulate them as two more battalions
were needed to raise the required number of observers authorized
by Resolution 1291 of the United Nations Security Council.
</P>
<P>
He explained that he had already written to the U.N. Secretary
General Kofi Annan, under the mandate of SADC, urging him to begin
deployment of U. N. peace-keepers in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
The commanders of all parties in the DRC conflict signed an
agreement on disengagement of forces at a meeting of the Joint
Military Commission in Uganda's capital Kampala on April 8.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said that after this meeting the commanders of the
armies fighting in the DRC ordered their field commanders to stop
fighting and that these orders had been obeyed.
</P>
<P>
He described the adoption of the plan as a major step forward
in the peace process which effectively removed what was being
cited as an obstacle to the deployment of U.N. observers.
</P>
<P>
The president urged U.N. to begin deployment of the personnel
available now and not necessarily wait until all the troops
authorized by the U.N. resolution are in place.

<HEADLINE> World Conference on Trade in Endangered Species Closes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
by Li Jinqi Sun Huixia
</P>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 20 (Xinhua) -- The 11th Conference of the
Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES)
ended here on Thursday after adopting a number of decisions on
further protecting dozens of animal and plant species from being
over-exploited.
</P>
<P>
The 11-day meeting, attended by over 2,000 delegates from more
than 100 countries, passed a five-year strategic plan for helping
governments conserve and sustainably use threatened species.
</P>
<P>
The plan also seeks to strengthen national trade enforcement
measures in order to reduce and ultimately eliminate illegal trade
of the endangered species.
</P>
<P>
One of the most closely watched decision made at the meeting
was an agreement to continue the ban on international ivory trade.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the elephant populations in Botswana,
Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe will remain on CITES Appendix
II which permits a strictly controlled trade, but the ban on the
ivory trade stays until an effective monitoring system is
established.
</P>
<P>
However, elephant population in other African countries are
still on Appendix I, which bans trade.
</P>
<P>
African elephant range states will continue to seek a
continent-wide consensus on a long-term conservation strategy and
that the ivory ban will be reviewed by the next CITES meeting in
two-and-a-half years.
</P>
<P>
Another decision adopted by the meeting is to maintain the ban
on international trade in whales, which has been in place since
1986. The International Whaling Commission will continue its work
on developing a global management plan for whale stocks.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Cuba's proposal to open up trade in Hawksbill
turtles and their shells failed, as did proposals by Australia,
Britain and the U.S. to regulate trade in the three largest sharks
-- basking, whale and great white sharks.
</P>
<P>
A number of species have been up-listed to CITES Appendix I at
the meeting, including Australian dugong (sea cow), New
Caledonia's horned parakeets, the coelacanth (a fossil fish),
Asia's urial (wild sheep) and Argentina's monkey puzzle tree.
</P>
<P>
Some species, mainly plants, were down listed from Appendix I
to Appendix II or removed completely from the CITES Appendices as
they have recovered sufficiently in number to be no longer
threatened by extinction.
</P>
<P>
In addition to adjusting the Appendices, the delegates made
other decisions on enforcement and national management for highly
endangered species including tigers.
</P>
<P>
CITES, adopted in 1973, is to ensure that no wild animal or
plant species is unsustainably exploited because of international
trade.
</P>
<P>
So far the CITES offers varying degree of protection to more
than 30,000 animal and plant species, depending on their
conditions in the wild and the effect that international trade may
have on their survival.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Turn Squatter Camps Into Eco-Villages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 20 (Xinhua) -- The South African government
plans to turn squatter camps throughout the country into
environmentally friendly eco-villages, Environmental Affairs
Minister Valli Moosa said here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He said the plan will reflect "the government's policy on
environmental quality and protection".
</P>
<P>
"These villages will transform informal township settlements
into models of sustainability that use natural and recycled
materials, energy efficient fixtures, renewable energy systems and
organic vegetable gardens and will have entrepreneurial ventures
employing residents," Moosa said.
</P>
<P>
The initiative is a precursor to the unveiling of South
Africa's White Paper on Integrated Pollution and Waste Management,
which is to be released in May.
</P>
<P>
Moosa said the White Paper release will be accompanied by
regulations on plastic bags.
</P>
<P>
The government has indicated that it intends to replace
polluting plastic bags with more environmentally friendly paper
bags.

<HEADLINE> Opposition Alliance Stages Demonstration in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 20 (Xinhua) -- the four-party opposition alliance
led by Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) staged countrywide
demonstrations Thursday, pledging to further consolidate their
unity to unseat the government and establish what they termed a "
nationalist and democratic one."
</P>
<P>
Addressing separate rallies in the capital city in observance
of the demonstration day, leaders of the alliance dubbed the
present government as "corrupt and subservient," and alleged its
four-year rule has simply manifested its ineptness to run the
country.
</P>
<P>
Accusing the government of failing to supply electricity, gas
and water to the people, the alliance leaders alleged that the
government cared little for the welfare of the people.
</P>
<P>
BNP, Jatiya Party (National Party), Jamaat-e-Islami Party and
Islami Oikya Jote (Islami Solidarity Front), which form the
alliance, held separate rallies and processions in Dhaka to
protest deteriorating law and order situation, and press its one-
point demand to dislodge the government.
</P>
<P>
Strongly criticizing the ministers and Awami League leaders for
their recent remarks regarding the justices of the High Court,
they alleged the criticism of judges by ruling party leaders was
designed to "destroy the judiciary."
</P>
<P>
Top leaders of the ruling Awami League recently blasted the
higher judiciary for what they said delaying the process of
execution of death sentences of the killers of Sheikh Mujibur
Rahman, the first Prime Minister of Bangladesh.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Prison Population Increased to 1,860,520 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 20 (Xinhua) -- U.S. prisons and jails held 1,
860,520 adults last year, an increase of 60,000 prisoners over the
previous year, according to a Justice Department report.
</P>
<P>
The United States may become the country with the highest rate
of incarceration in the world, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Viewing the latest figures in light of the current U.S.
population, one of every 147 residents was an inmate in an adult
jail or prison at the middle of last year.
</P>
<P>
The report estimated that the number of Americans behind bars
will likely surpass 2 million by the end of next year.
</P>
<P>
"In the federal system, growth is being driven by drug law
violators and immigration violators coming in," said statistician
Allen J. Beck, author of the report issued here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. prison population has grown steadily for more than a
quarter-century, helped by increased drug prosecutions and tougher
policies against all offenders.
</P>
<P>
Beck said that if the current growth continues, the total
prison and jail population would likely hit 2 million in the
second half of 2001.
</P>
<P>
More than 1.1 million inmates were held in state prisons, about
606,000 men and women in local jails, and about 118,000 in federal
prisons. The prison population was fewer than 800,000 people in
1985.
</P>
<P>
The number of women in U.S. prisons doubled since 1990 to more
than 87,000 in 1999, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Among black men in their 20s or early 30s, about 11 percent
were in prison or jail, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Louisiana had the highest total incarceration rate, with more
than 1 percent of the state's population imprisoned.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Stresses Importance of Comprehensive, Just and Lasting Peace in Mideast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 20 (Xinhua)-- The United Nations Security
Council on Thursday adopted a presidential statement, stressing
the importance of, and the need for, achieving a comprehensive,
just and lasting peace in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council this morning reviewed a letter from U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan in which he informed the Council of
Israel's decision to withdraw all its troops from southern Lebanon
by July 2000.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council endorsed the decision of the Secretary-
General to initiate preparations to enable the United Nations to
carry out its responsibilities under resolutions 425 (1978) and
426(1978).
</P>
<P>
The Council expressed the view that cooperation by all parties
concerned will be required in order to avoid a deterioration of
the situation.
</P>
<P>
The Council welcomed the Secretary-General's decision to send
his Special Envoy to the region as soon as practicable and
encouraged all parties to cooperate fully in the complete
implementation of resolutions 425 and 426.
</P>
<P>
The Council looked forward to the Secretary-General reporting
back as soon as possible on relevant development, including the
outcome of the consultations with the parties and all interested
Member States and those contributing troops to the United Nations
Interim Force in Lebanon, and his conclusions and recommendations
regarding the plans and requirements for implementation of
resolution 425 and 426 and all other relevant resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Israel on Monday told the Secretary-General that It had
decided to withdraw its troops from Southern Lebanon by July 2000.
Israel promised that it would cooperate fully with the United
Nations in implementing the resolutions of 425 and 426.
</P>
<P>
Resolutions 425 and 426 were adopted after Israel's incursion
into southern Lebanon against Palestinian guerrillas in 1978,
which called for immediate cease of Israeli military action
against Lebanese territorial integrity and withdrawal of Israeli
forces from all Lebanon territory.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has since deployed a 4,500 member peacekeeping force
in southern Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Earnings Rise in UK Stokes Up Rate Hike Worries  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 20 (Xinhua) - The biggest rise in average
earnings in Britain for eight years in February has made an
interest rate rise more likely next month.
</P>
<P>
It is announced the private sector pay increased by an average
6.5 percent in the year to February compared with 4.2 percent in
the public sector.
</P>
<P>
The latest dada, published by the Office For National
Statistics(ONS), showed that as unemployment fell to its lowest
level for 20 years, average earnings rose by 6 percent in the year
to February, the largest increase since 1992.
</P>
<P>
The ONS said salaries were partly being boosted by bonus
payments - in particular those earned by people who worked over
the millennium holiday.
</P>
<P>
City economists warned that the Bank of England would almost
certainly use the latest evidence of wage inflation to push up the
cost of borrowing next month.
</P>
<P>
They said that the Bank's monetary policy committee will, after
two months of holding interest rates, raise them again by a
quarter point in May.
</P>
<P>
Official figures also showed that unemployment remained at a 20-
year low in March. The number out of work and claiming benefit
fell 7700 to 1148800, or 4 percent of the workforce.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the figures, Darshinni David, an economist in
HSBC, said: "If there is any reason the Bank would consider
raising rates again it would be from the labor market."
</P>
<P>
Michael Dicks, at Lehman brothers, said the wage figure was
bound to have a "psychological impact" on the committee. "At 6
percent, that will give quite a different feeling from the 4.5
percent the Bank sees as compatible with its inflation target."

<HEADLINE> Quebec Doctor Uses Radioactive Seeds in Cancer Treatment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, April 20 (Xinhua) -- A Canadian doctor is using
radioactive seeds to treat prostate cancer and has achieved
success in more than 80 percent of the cases, the Globe and Mail
newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The treatment has prevented relapses in about 144 of a total of
172 cases of prostrate cancer in the past five years after
receiving the "radioactive implants," said the report.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Jean Pouliot, head of the medical physics research group at
the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Quebec, invented the
computer-guided brachytherapy which injects small, intensely
radioactive titanium pellets into a patient's prostate gland to
kill cancer cells.
</P>
<P>
First, Dr. Pouliot uses ultrasound images of a patient's
prostate gland to create a three-dimensional picture to decide
where to place the radioactive seeds, and then he injects between
50 to 100 titanium pellets through ultrasound-guided needles into
the cancerous cells.
</P>
<P>
The new form of brachytherapy can lead to fewer cases of
impotence and urination problems than traditional surgery or
radiation treatments. The patient can go home on the day he
receives the treatment and may return to work within two days,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The patient, however, is made somewhat radioactive at low
levels, the report added.

BEIJING, April 20 (Xinhua) -- The China Academy of
Telecommunication Technology (CATT) under the Ministry of
Information and Telecommunication, recently concluded evaluating
the third-generation WCDMA (Wide Code-Division Multiple Access)
system with Ericsson China.
</P>
<P>
"All application and services with the trial WCDMA system have
been tested to meet standards, setting a solid foundation for
China's smooth transition to the new telecom era," said Zhang Ken,
vice president of Ericsson China.
</P>
<P>
The trial system, established in early 1999, has handled voice/
video data, UDI transmissions and high-speed packet data.
</P>
<P>
Zou Tong, deputy director of the science and technology
department of CATT, said, "We have been testing the WCDMA
experimental system provided by Ericsson, and the results are
encouraging us to intensify our cooperation in this area."
</P>
<P>
Zhang noted that the achievements of the WCDMA trial system
will help accelerate the commercialization of the third-generation
telecom and the mobile Internet service.
</P>
<P>
Ericsson signed an agreement with CATT in 1998 to install
WCDMA evaluation systems on a trial basis in China.

<HEADLINE> Iran's Reformist Councilor Released on Bail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Ahmad Hakimipour, member of Tehran
Municipal Council detained last week in alleged connection with an
assassination attempt, was freed on Thursday on bail.
</P>
<P>
Tehran Justice Department said in a statement that Hakimipour
was freed after depositing a bail of 200 million rials (about 24,
000 U.S. dollars at the market rate), the Islamic Republic News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
An open court hearing will be held at Tehran Islamic revolution
court on Tuesday for the suspects involved in an abortive
assassination attempt against Saeed Hajjarian, a close ally of
President Mohammad Khatami, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Hakimipour was arrested last Friday on charges of involvement in
the assassination attempt on the confessions of other people
arrested on the same charge.
</P>
<P>
Hakimipour became a suspect in the assassination because a
letter handed over to Hajjarian, which prepared the ground for the
assassination attempt, was signed by Hakimipour.
</P>
<P>
Hajjarian, vice chairman of Tehran Municipal Council, was
seriously wounded in a shooting on March 12 in front of the council
hall in downtown Tehran, and was rushed to a nearby hospital by
Hakimipour.
</P>
<P>
The council on Monday lodged a strong protest to Hakimipour's
arrest, saying that "the agents of threat who are known to the
public are free while Hakimipour who had saved the life of
Hajjarian through devotion and self-sacrifice has been arrested."
</P>
<P>
Reformist groups and parties said that bringing Hakimipour's
letter to the assassination scene was a well-designed plot by
certain people to crackdown the reformists, who won an overwhelming
victory in February key parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
But newspapers close to the powerful conservatives, who dominate
most of the country's sensitive organs, urged the authorities to
find the links between Hakimipour and other suspects.

<HEADLINE> Fierce Fighting Rages in Northern Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Heavy fighting raged in northern
Sri Lanka Thursday as Tamil Tiger rebels escalated their attacks
on a government camp amid huge losses on both sides, military
officials said.
</P>
<P>
They said a battle was raging around the Iyakachchi military
base on the northernmost Jaffna peninsula with both sides
exchanging heavy artillery and mortar fires.
</P>
<P>
"Heavy fighting is going on now in the northeast of the
Elephant Pass sector," said Military Spokesman Brigadier Palitha
Fernando, adding that the army was now using a new route to keep a
supply line open to the troops in the battle theater.
</P>
<P>
His remarks came as the separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil
Eelam (LTTE) said they had mounted a ferocious offensive against
government forces and captured a section of a key highway in the
peninsula on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE said in a statement sent here from their London office
on Wednesday evening that they took a six-kilometer stretch
between Pallai and Iyakachchi along the strategic A-9 highway
which connects Jaffna with the vital military complex of the
Elephant Pass, a causeway linking the peninsula with the mainland.
</P>
<P>
"The LTTE combat formations scored a major military victory ...
when they overran several camps and military bases of Sri Lankan
troops in Massar and Soranpattu area," the LTTE said.
</P>
<P>
The rebels had also destroyed several army tanks and blown up
ammunition dumps in the battle theater, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
It added following the attacks Sri Lankan soldiers had left
behind "scores of dead soldiers and huge quantities of modern
weapons," but gave no details of their casualties.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Defense said in a statement on Thursday that
the forward defense line in the Soranpattu and Muhavil areas on
the peninsula had been "readjusted" after heavy fighting.
</P>
<P>
It said 21 troops, including one officer, were killed in action
and 213 were wounded in Wednesday's fighting that erupted after
the LTTE rebels launched a fierce assault on the army the day
before.
</P>
<P>
The statement said more than 35 LTTE rebels were killed and a
large number injured on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The latest rebel assault began exactly five years after they
pulled out of the peace talks in 1995, breaking a cease-fire by
sinking two naval boats in the eastern port city of Trincomalee.
</P>
<P>
Since then thousands of rebels and soldiers have been killed or
wounded in the fighting, termed by the LTTE Eelam War III, or the
third round of battle in their quest for a separate homeland for
minority Tamils in Sri Lanka's north and east since 1983.
</P>
<P>
The fresh fighting is an intensified effort by the rebels to
capture the Elephant Pass causeway, the first step to regain their
former stronghold of Jaffna which they lost in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Thai Exports Likely to Rise 10 Percent This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Thai exports to overseas markets
are expected to reach the government's target of 62 billion U.S.
dollars this year, an increase of 10 percent from last year, the
office of Thai Deputy Prime Minister and Commerce Minister
Supachai Panitchpakdi declared here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement from the office, the anticipated
growth of overall Thai exports this year was a fruitful result of
the government's continued policy to support expanded exports both
in key and new markets.
</P>
<P>
Thai exports in the first quarter of this year grew by 30
percent, particularly in the group of electrical appliances, and
are believed to grow at least 10 percent at the end of the year,
achieving the government's goal of 62 billion U.S. dollars, the
statement noted.
</P>
<P>
It said a recent survey also found that Thai products were most
recognized in the Southeast Asian markets, and Thailand had the
highest level of export values among Southeast Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
However, it said, that there would still be a need to
restructure the production process of Thai agricultural products
to be compliant with the international standard.

<HEADLINE> Macedonia Seizes Marijuana on Border With Albania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Macedonian customs authorities
have arrested a member of a major transnational drug ring in the
Balkans and seized 465 kilograms of highly refined marijuana at a
crossing on the country's border with Albania, the MIA news agency
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Police made the arrest late Tuesday night. The marijuana was in
468 bags and stashed in the cap of a truck waiting to enter
Macedonia, Stevo Pendarovski, a spokesman for Macedonia's Interior
Ministry was quoted as saying. The marijuana has a street value of
700,000 U.S. dollars, he said.
</P>
<P>
The driver, who was arrested at the scene, is reportedly a
member of a major drug ring engaged in drug smuggling on the
Macedonia-Albania border, the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
The report said that since the early 1990s, Albania has become
a major producer of marijuana, and serves as a vital transit route
for drug dealers to smuggle drugs to the rest of Europe.

<P>
WASHINGTON, April 20 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- A federal court on Wednesday gave the Miami relatives of
Elian Gonzalez a potentially significant legal victory when it
ordered that the six-year-old shipwreck survivor must stay in the
United States at least until next month, when it bears their
appeal of a government decision that would return him to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Two rigorous studies involving thousands of people have
failed to confirm one of the most widely held beliefs about diet
and health: that eating low-fat, high-fiber foods can reduce the
risk of colon and rectal cancer.
</P>
<P>
-- Russian president-elect Vladimir Putin scored a victory with
regional bosses in parliament's upper chamber, winning a vote to
oust a prosecutor who was the scourge of the Kremlin under former
president Boris Yeltsin. The upper house also gave approval to the
Start II arms reduction pact between Russia and the United States.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- Stock prices retreated, with the Nasdaq off 87.16 points to
3706.41 and the Dow Jones industrials down 92.46 to 10674.96. The
dollar advanced, but the euro fell to another new low. Meanwhile,
companies' earnings have exceeded Wall Street expectations so far
this reporting season, suggesting the U.S. economy has room to
grow.
</P>
<P>
-- The Italian premier's resignation was accepted, setting off
a scramble to form a new government. Massimo D'Alema, in office
for 18 months, quit after allies lost regional elections on Sunday.
His center-left coalition, bolstered by the Social Democrats'
return, says it has enough votes to retain power.

<P>
BEIJING, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Former champions Dalian Shide set
the tone of a "Dark Thursday" for the top sides in the Chinese
first division soccer league, toppling down the defending
champions Shandong Luneng 5-0 at home.
</P>
<P>
Sichuan Quanxing needed a modest 1-0 win over last season's
runners-ups Liaoning Fushun to usurp the top place on the
standings from Tianjin Taida, who cracked down to Shenyang Haishi
5-1 in Shenyang, the capital of Liaoning Province.
</P>

Sichuan, who have 12 points from three wins and three draws,
edged out Shanghai Shenhua, who were held a 1-1 draw by the
relegated Xiamen Xiaxin, on goals advantage. Dalian and Taida
followed with 11 points.
</P>
<P>
A total of 24 goals were scored in the sixth round of the
premier soccer league, in contrast to the 59 goals in the previous
five rounds.
</P>
<P>
Dalian, known as Dalian Wanda when they won three out of five
league titles before the 1997-1998 season, benched the Chinese
first forward Hao Haidong and lined up a foreign-talent attacking
duo, Adilsondos Santos and Miodrag Pantelic.
</P>
<P>
Brazilian Santos opened the mark in the 38th minute with a
header and centerback Xu Hong stroke the lead to 2-0 before the
break.
</P>
<P>
In the 60th minute, Santos added another with a strip shot
after a brilliant sole run around several Shandong's defenders.
</P>
<P>
Yan Song put more funs in the goals spree when he slipped home
on Pantelic's neat cross in the 80th minute, and Pantelic, from
Yugoslavia, completed the party with his first goal in China with

BEIJING, April 20 (Xinhua) -- A survey in 35 of China's major

<P>
DALIAN, April 20 (Xinhua) -- China will take harsh measures to
crack down on dishonest tourist operators, Peng Zhikai, an
official of the National Tourism Administration (NTA), spoke at
the ongoing China Scenic Spot and Resort Exhibition.
</P>
<P>
Violations are prevalent when some travel services are
organizing overseas trips, he added.
</P>
<P>
Violations include taking tourists to other destinations not on
their itinerary, unqualified travel agencies organizing overseas
trips and misleading advertisements that claim to offer cheap
prices.
</P>
<P>
The NTA revoked the licenses of two travel services in Shenzhen
city and Zhejiang province. They also suspended the right of three
other travel agencies to organize overseas trips during the first
quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
The NTA will also increase cooperation with related departments
to improve its overseas tourism market, Peng said.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong's Consumer Price Index Down In March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's consumer prices in
overall terms registered a year-on-year rate of decrease of 5.0
percent in March, slightly smaller than in February, according to
the Census and Statistics Department.
</P>
<P>
The decreases were largely attributable to a narrowing of
decline in the prices of clothing and footwear and, to a lesser
extent, also in private housing rentals and the prices of some
consumer durables.
</P>
<P>
In the first quarter of 2000, the price index also declined by
5.1 percent as compared to the same period in 1999.
</P>
<P>
A Government Secretariat spokesman noted that consumer prices
continued on a down trend in March 2000. The decline was fairly
broad-based across many major commodity groups due to the
prevalence of substantial price discounts at various retail
outlets, he said.
</P>
<P>
Yet the decline in consumer prices in overall terms seemed to
have stabilized in the most recent period, along with a firming up
in import prices of some consumer durables, the spokesman added.

<HEADLINE> CPPCC Chairman on China's Poverty Relief Work (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Despite these efforts, poverty relief in China still faces
many difficulties and problems. We urged all friends present to
offer opinions and suggestions," he said.
</P>
<P>
Li described the poverty-relief work as "glorious, great and
lofty". He cited two Chinese idioms to elaborate his points. One
is "adding flowers to the brocade -- or making what is good still
better," and the other is "sending charcoal in snowy weather -- or
giving help for those in need." "The latter is more important and
valuable," he commented.
</P>
<P>
The Symposium will focus on eliminating poverty with the
combined efforts of the government, private enterprises and non-
governmental organizations.
</P>
<P>
Officials, scholars and experts from China Glory Project
Promotion Council and several United Nations organizations will
attend the Symposium.
</P>
<P>
Wang Guangying, vice-chairman of the National People's Congress
Standing Committee, Wang Zhaoguo and Jing Shuping, two vice-
chairmen of CPPCC National Committee, were among those present at

<HEADLINE> SLA Militiaman Killed, 2 Israeli Soldiers Injured </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 20 (Xinhua) -- One South Lebanon Army (SLA)
militiaman was killed and three others, including a SLA member and
two Israeli soldiers, were injured Thursday morning in south
Lebanon in a series of attacks launched by Lebanese resistance
forces, Oriental Radio station reported.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese resistance forces issued a statement in Beirut saying
that they detonated a big bomb near two Israeli positions of Abala
and Menala in south Lebanon when a Israeli patrol passed.
</P>
<P>
Israeli radio reported that Israel confirmed the casualties
after the attacks.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Hezbollah fired 11 Katyusha rockets at Israeli
positions, but no casualties were reported.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak threatened "cruel retaliatory
blows" if the Katyusha attacks continues. "If the rocket attacks
continue and if people are hit, Israel's response will be cruel.
Once Israel withdraws its troops from south Lebanon to the internal
border there will be no alibi or excuse for anyone to attack
Israel", Barak told state-run Radio Israel Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
Israel has notified the United Nations formally that it will
pull out its troops from south Lebanon permanently by July.
</P>
<P>
Israel has occupied parts of south Lebanon since 1978. It set up
a "security zone" in 1985 saying it needed to protect its northern
settlements from cross-border guerrilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
Syrian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has since been leading
a war of attrition to try to end the Israeli occupation of south
Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Iran's Revolutionary Guards Deny Coup Intention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Iran's elite Islamic Revolutionary
Guards Corps (IRGC) on Thursday dismissed the accusation that the
forces would launch a coup d'etat against the reformists, main
supporters of President Mohammad Khatami.
</P>
<P>
Issuing a statement, the IRGC said that the body which has taken
shape to safeguard the Islamic republic can never launch a coup
against its own objectives, the Islamic Republic News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The IRGC has made separation between the friends and the enemies
of the Islamic revolution and the Iranian nation and the
transparent border has formed the coral part of the IRGC behaviors,
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The IRGC cited as "enemies" those who attack the aspirations of
the late supreme leader Ayatollah Musavi Khomeini and the religious
sanctities, and politically justify the return of political and
cultural dominance of the world arrogance especially the U.S. and
Israel, and work to break up the national unity.
</P>
<P>
The revolutionary guards complained that certain political
groups have cast doubt over the security environment of the country
and accused the IRGC of making preparation for a coup against the
reformists, the main supporters of President Mohammad Khatami.
</P>
<P>
The IRGC said that certain political parties and newspapers have
embarked on propaganda campaign against the body after it issued a
statement on Sunday, which gave a stern warning to the pro-
reformist press that came under mounting pressure of the
conservatives.
</P>
<P>
The guards, a pillar of the Islamic regime under the direct
control of the supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, accused
reformist newspapers of writing articles defending "U.S.-style"
reforms in Iran, which has been already rejected by Khamenei.
</P>
<P>
The power struggle between reformers and conservatives has
intensified since the February parliamentary polling, in which the
newly-grown reformists won an overwhelming victory over the
conservatives, who dominate most of the state organs.
</P>
<P>
The two factions accused each other of having a hand in the
abortive assassination attempt against the life of Saeed Hajjarian,
a reformist leader and a close ally of President Khatami.
</P>
<P>
Over 140 conservative parliamentarians on Wednesday urged the
judiciary to punish Iranian reformists who attended a conference in
Berlin last week on Iran after the February elections and accused
them of advocating the U.S.-style reforms in Iran.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, reformist parties blast the pro-conservative state
television for screening "selective parts" of the Berlin conference
with an aim to stop the new reformist-dominated parliament from
meeting and undermine Khatami's reform programs.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Makes Progress in Poverty Reduction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, April 20 (Xinhua) -- An additional 415,000 households in
Vietnam rose above the poverty line in 1999, reducing the rate of
hunger and poor households in the country to 13 percent from 15
percent in 1998, Vietnam News Agency reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Provinces, cities, ministries and national corporations of the
country last year mobilized nearly 7,000 billion Vietnamese dong (
500 million U.S. dollars) to implement projects on poverty
reduction, according to a report presented at a conference held

As a result, more than 2,200 communication, irrigation, water
supply, and electricity projects, schools, medical stations and
markets were built in the targeted communes in 37 provinces in
1999.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank, the United Nations Development Program, the

Sweden and non-governmental organizations of other foreign
countries have granted investments in building medical stations,
schools, irrigation works, and water supply facilities for poor
communes.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Guatemalan Leader Cancels French Trip, Fearing Detention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Former Guatemalan president and
current parliament speaker, Efrain Rios Montt, canceled a visit to
France on Wednesday for fears of treading the path of former
Chilean military leader Augusto Pinochet, Le Figaro daily reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet was placed under house arrest in 1998 when he was in
Britain for medical treatment after a Spanish lawyer requested his
extradition to Spain for trial on charges of human rights abuses
during Pinochet's rule of iron fist between 1973 and 1990.
</P>
<P>
Montt, who was president of Guatemala between March 1982 and
August 1983, is under investigation by a Spanish judge for his
role in the death of several Spanish citizens in Guatemala during
his presidency.
</P>
<P>
The inquiry was launched last December after Guatemala's Nobel
Peace Prize laureate Rigoberta Menchu accused the former president
of "crimes of genocide, terrorism and tortures."
</P>
<P>
Montt explained the cancellation of his visit with just one
sentence: "Guatemala is more beautiful."
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro said Montt apparently followed the advice of his
lawyers who reminded him of the "misadventure" of 84-year-old
Pinochet in Britain.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet, who was detained in Britain on October 16, 1998, was
allowed to return home on March 1, 2000, after British Home
Secretary Jackie Straw ruled that he was physically and mentally
unfit for trial.
</P>
<P>
Montt's parliamentary immunity at home won't help him if he
leaves his country. Pinochet, a senator, also enjoys a life-long
parliamentary immunity from criminal prosecution.

<HEADLINE> Falling Car Exports Drag Down Canada's Trade Surplus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Falling car exports dragged down
Canada's trade surplus by half a billion Canadian dollars (about
339 million U.S. dollars) in February, the country's National Post
newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Citing the latest figures from Statistics Canada, the paper
said the surplus fell from a record 4.5 billion Canadian dollars
(about 3.1 billion U.S. dollars) in January to 4 billion Canadian
dollars (about 2.7 billion U.S. dollars) in February.
</P>
<P>
The drop highlighted a severe slowdown of auto exports, which
fell 14.1 percent in February from the previous month, as
manufacturers shut plants for inventory purposes.
</P>
<P>
Canadian economists, however, expect the decline to be a
temporary one, saying there is no indication that demand for autos
has waned.
</P>
<P>
"Production difficulties hampered Canada's ability to capture U.
S. demand," Warren Lovely, an economist in Toronto, was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The country also saw its imports down 1.2 percent in February
to 28.3 billion Canadian dollars (about 19.2 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
That decline was led by the machinery, forestry and aircraft
sectors, the newspaper said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 20 (Xinhua) -- China is drafting laws and
regulations on venture investments to facilitate the growth of
Chinese hi-tech companies, a senior government official said here
today.
</P>
<P>
Sun Zhenyu, vice minister of foreign trade and economic
cooperation, made the remark at an international forum held here
today.
</P>
<P>
The Sino-U.S. Venture Investment Forum was sponsored by the
Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC) and
NASDAQ and Intel from the United States.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from the sponsors and Chinese enterprises and
financial institutions discussed the important role of venture
investment in promoting China's hi-tech industry.
</P>
<P>
Cheng Siwei, vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of China's
National People's Congress (NPC), said the Chinese legislature is
accelerating the process of drafting laws concerning venture
investment.
</P>
<P>
It is also considering revising taxation laws and regulations
regarding the administration of industry and commerce according to
international practices, he said. China is planning to develop a
complete legal framework on venture investment.
</P>
<P>
Last year, China amended the Corporate Law to encourage the
development of hi-tech companies.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Chaoyang, chief executive officer of the well-known
Chinese Internet company Sohu.com, said that over the past year,
venture investment in China has greatly improved. He said that
many Chinese Internet companies are now able to draw adequate
funds for promoting their market.
</P>
<P>
Sun said that since hi-tech companies are expected to play a
key role in China's economic growth in the future, the Chinese
government will support the growth of these companies.

<HEADLINE> Financial Reform Still Crucial: Premier (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, April 20 (Xinhua)-- Continuing financial reform and
effectively minimizing financial risks remain an important and
urgent task in China, cautioned Premier Zhu Rongji today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to leading officials of east China's Jiangsu Province
during a recent study tour of the province, Zhu said that all
banks and financial institutions must build a modern financial
system, improve their management skills and enhance their capacity
against dangers and risks.
</P>
<P>
The premier said that reform should be carried out particularly
in state banks and should learn from overseas modern financial
systems.
</P>
<P>
He warned non-financial institutions of engaging in financial
activities and urged tough measures on those found dealing in
illegal fund raising activities.
</P>
<P>
He also said that financial institutions should be able to
manage their assets independently.
</P>
<P>
Zhu talked at length on the importance of maintaining stability
in rural areas, urging local State grain firms to buy grain from
farmers at protection prices.

<P>
Counter to government policy, many State grain firms have
refused to buy grain from farmers at a time when supply exceeds
demand. A survey shows that State grain firms have bought two-
thirds of farmers' surplus grain. Jiangsu has done better, buying
up 80 percent of farmers' surplus grain.
</P>
<P>
He said that governments at all levels should increase their
fiscal subsidies in buying grain.
</P>
<P>
In addition, China will build granaries with a combined storing
capacity of 10 billion kilos of grain this year and next, he said.
China has built granaries with an aggregate storing capacity of 35
billion kilos of grain in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
"A prerequisite of opening up the grain purchase market is that
State grain firms should always be ready to purchase grain from
farmers no cheaper than the protection prices," he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhu also urged alleviating taxes and charges on farmers,
calling it not just an economic issue, but also a serious
political matter.
</P>
<P>
He also requested township governments to reduce their staff
and improve efficiency.

<HEADLINE> PLA Chief of General Staff Holds Talks with Australian Guests (2)  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On Sino-U.S. relations, Fu said that Taiwan issue is the most
important and sensitive issue in Sino-U.S. relations. The Chinese
government hopes that the U.S. will earnestly abide by the three
Joint Communiques and other commitments to avoid undermining Sino-
U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
He said that Chinese government's principled policy in
resolving the Taiwan issue -- peaceful reunification and one
country, two systems -- has remained unchanged, but it has not
ruled out the possibility of using force.
</P>
<P>
"The PLA has confidence, determination and ability to safeguard
state sovereignty and territorial integrity. Any attempt to split
motherland is doomed to failure," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Fu also mentioned that recently the U.S. and other countries
lodged anti-China resolution at the United Nations Commission on
Human Rights, but failed to pass for the ninth times.
</P>
<P>
It shows that dialogue and cooperation is the general trend,
and favored by the majority of people, and using the human rights
issue as the excuse of confrontation is unpopular and leads
nowhere, he said.
</P>
<P>
Barrie said he is happy to see the frequent exchange of visits
and military cooperation between Australia and China over the past
two years, and expressed his willingness to strengthen the
military cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Barrie reaffirmed that Australia has stuck to "one China"
principle. He noted that China and the U.S. are influential
countries, adding that Australia hopes that Sino-U.S. relations
would maintain a healthy and steady development.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the meeting, a ceremony was held to welcome the
Australian guests. Xiong Guangkai, deputy chief of General Staff
of the PLA, attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Barrie arrived here Wednesday for a 8-day official visit to
China at the invitation of Fu.

<P>
BEIJING, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Fu Quanyou, chief of the General
Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA), held talks
here today with Christopher Barrie, chief commander of the
Australian defense forces.
</P>
<P>
Fu, also a member of the Central Military Commission, exchanged
views with Barrie on bilateral relations, regional and
international affairs and army building.

Asian-Pacific region, and the maintenance of the friendly
relations between the two countries conforms to the fundamental
interest of the people of China and Australia.
</P>
<P>
China is willing to continue cooperation and military exchanges

While peace and development prevail in much of the world today,
hegemonism and power politics still exist, which bring instability.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Xinhua Blasts America's Double Standard on Cults (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Xinhua News Agency published a
commentary today criticizing some anti-China elements in the
United States for their interference in China's internal affairs
under the guise of "safeguarding human rights" and their double
standard on the issue of cults.
</P>
<P>
Since July 1999, when the Chinese government banned Falun Gong
in accordance with law, the U.S. anti-China forces have used the
cult as a new card to play in the ongoing human rights game, the
article says, listing the following examples:
</P>
<P>
On November 18, the U.S. House of Representatives adopted a
resolution demanding that the U.S. government pressure China on
the issue of Falun Gong. The proposal was passed "unanimously" in
the presence of only seven or eight congressmen, as the Congress
was about to recess.
</P>
<P>
On March 23, 2000, representative of the U.S. government
attacked all the countries that it clashes with at the UN Human
Rights Commission Conference in Geneva, and during the attack on
China, the representative linked the Falun Gong cult with the
issue of human rights.
</P>
<P>
It is widely known that the Falun Gong is a cult that has
forcibly indoctrinated its practitioners with its dangerous
theories and brainwashed them with its peculiar "spiritual"
beliefs, which have done irreparable emotional and physical damage
to them.
</P>
<P>
To date, more than 1,500 Falun Gong practitioners have died as
a result of the teachings of cult founder Li Hongzhi, while many
other Falun Gong believers have gone insane, been disowned by
their families, and even committed murder, according to the
article.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Falun Gong members have frequently held illegal
gatherings to protest against those who have proclaimed different
views, infringing on others' human rights and endangering social
stability.

<TEXT>
<P>
Some in the United States willingly support the Falun Gong cult
that is acting against human rights and humankind. "Have they
forgotten the slogan of 'protecting human rights' that they chant
every day?" the Xinhua commentator asks.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government, which is clear-minded on the infringement
of American people's human rights by cults, has never been
softhearted when cracking down on cults in the United States, the
article says
</P>
<P>
On May 13, 1985, in a siege against a local cult group, the U.S.
police in Philadelphia used helicopters to drop C-4 explosives,
killing 11 people including five children. A total of 60 families
were destroyed during the police action.
</P>
<P>
On February 28, 1993, dozens of U.S. federal marshals and FBI
agents, together with 450 armed police officers and soldiers,
scores of tanks, armored vehicles and helicopters, joined in a
massive assault on a branch of the Davidian cult organization at
Waco, Texas. Eighty-six cult members died in fires.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government, which is keenly aware of the threat cults
pose to social order, has turned to judicial and administrative
means and even used armed forces to crack down on domestic cult
groups.
</P>
<P>
The "human rights guardians" in the United States are well-
aware of the dangerous nature of cults and they did not put
forward any human rights proposals when there was a heavy presence
of armed police officers, tanks, armored vehicles and helicopters
in the attacks against cults and even the headquarters of the cult
groups was leveled, the article says, adding that all these are
acceptable for the "human rights guardians" in the United States.
</P>
<P>
However, it says, anti-China forces in the United States roared
when the Chinese government legally banned a cult group that had
not followed legal registration procedures.
</P>
<P>
"You'e infringing on human rights," shouted anti-China elements
in the United States.

"While the United States is allowed to set a fire, China is not
allowed to light a lamp," the commentary says.
</P>
<P>
The United States has adopted a double standard on the issue of
human rights, it points out, stressing that the aim of the double
stgandard is to serve the interests of the U.S. itself.
</P>
<P>
Sensible people know that cults threaten normal social order
and must not be allowed to spread in any country. The U.S.
government has been vigilant against the formation of cults and
has taken preventive measures to stop them. As for those cult
groups that have become powerful enough to endanger the society,
the U.S. government has taken measures to restrict or prohibit
them, and even used armed forces to attack them.
</P>
<P>
The article goes on to criticize the U.S. government for its
double standard on the issue of human rights, noting that some in
the U.S. are inordinately fond of Falun Gong, not because they
believe in the mystical powers of Li Hongzhi, but because the
issue just gives them another opportunity to interfere in China's
internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Some Americans like to give the Chinese people lessons on human
rights. In their eyes, the article stresses, Li Hongzhi does not
infringe upon human rights when he threatens, controls and
violates his followers with his evil thinkings; Falun Gong
practitioners are practicing "freedom in belief" when they,
bewitched by Li, refuse medical treatment when they fall ill, when
numerous Falun Gong practitioners are going insane, injuring
themselves, committing suicide or murder, and being disowned by
their families -- or killed.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has banned Falun Gong and helped the
practitioners rid themselves of the spiritual chains of Li's
teachings, helped them return to a normal life and recover their
health and dignity. "Is it a protection of human rights for the
people, especially the Falun Gong practicers?" it asks.

<P>
In the eyes of those Americans, there are many kinds of human
rights, and they adopt different criteria for different human
rights, the article says, adding that the U.S. government has
adopted a criterion for its own human rights issue, and used
another one for the human rights issues in countries that are not
obedient to it.
</P>
<P>
The Xinhua commentator says that those people have vilified
China on "human rights" pretexts, because China has implemented an
independent foreign policy of peace, because China has always made
decisions by its own, and because China has refused to dance to
the baton of some others.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the article says, some Americans have long practiced
the double standard on the issue of human rights. The U.S. State
Department produces an annual report on human rights conditions in
different countries, which is politically biased and criticizes
China and some other countries. But the report has ignored human
rights problems that are prevalent in the United States.
</P>
<P>
One fourth of the prisoners in the world are housed in the U.S.
prisons; 49 percent of U.S. prisoners are black people who account
for 13 percent of the country's total. In the United States, the
infant mortality rate of the black people is three times that of
the white; fifteen out of every 100,000 young people are killed a
year. In the American city of Chicago, 3,000 people have sued
local police for police brutality, but none of the police accused
have been fired. The United States remains among a handful of
nations that have not joined the Convention on Children's Rights
and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of
Discrimination against Women.
</P>
<P>
The article tells those Americans who have worked so hard to
attack China's human rights situation, even linking it with cults,
to take a hard look at the reality of life in the United States. "
Why don't they do something substantial to improve the human
rights situation in their own country?" it asks.

The article condemns some Falun Gong members in China who have
taken the side of the anti-China forces in the Untied States when
the issue of Falun Gong is used by those anti-China elements to
attack the Chinese government. Since the second half of last year,
some Falun Gong elements have begun lobbying across the United
States, spreading rumors and slanders against the Chinese
government, though the cult group is supposed to have upheld "
truth, mercy and tolerance" and claims that it "will not
participate in politics."
</P>
<P>
On March 20 this year, when the UN Human Rights Commission
Conference was inaugurated, a follower of Li Hongzhi held a news
briefing in Geneva and issued an announcement claiming that they
were very glad to see that the U.S. government was ready to raise
a proposal at the conference to criticize China's human rights
records in 1999. The follower also said that human rights
violations could not be regarded as internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, cult groups of various kinds have been rampant
in some countries including China, the United States, France,
Japan and Uganda, says the article. It calls cults a "malignant
tumour in the world community".
</P>
<P>
The Xinhua commentator advises anti-China elements who have
acted under the name of protecting human rights and actually used
the cult to oppose China, not to continue moving against social
progress and conscience. Those who have attempted to make use of
Falun Gong are certain to fall victims to the cult. Appeasement
brings disaster, it says.

Some residual bad elements still exist today, while some deep-

some people worship bourgeois value and life-style. Corrupt

reiterates the Party's principles of democratic centralism and
criticism and self-criticism.
</P>
<P>
Leading officials must be supervised wherever they exercise

ones are the main target of people and the corruption of a few of
them will impose greater negative impact on society.
</P>

To ensure a victory for the anti-corruption campaign, education
is the basis; legal system is the guarantee; and supervision is
the key, according to the article. The soil on which corruption is
growing should be eradicated through reforms.
</P>
<P>
In China, a socialist country, all powers belong to the people,
while all officials are servants to the people and must be
supervised by the people. While the anti-corruption campaign
should not adopt the form of mass movement, it must follow the

campaign will not succeed without the participation of the people.
</P>
<P>
The anti-corruption campaign is a long-term and arduous task
for the Party and will be carried out throughout the reform period,

<HEADLINE> Iranian Leader Warns against Reformist Press </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Supreme leader Seyyed Ali
Khamenei issued a severe warning Thursday that some of the
country's newspapers are becoming "enemy strongholds."
</P>
<P>
Addressing a massive gathering of young people at a prayer
ground of the late spiritual leader Imam Khomeini, Khamenei accused
some newspapers for "doing the same thing" as U.S., British and
Israeli agencies.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. is attempting to hatch plots against Iran through its
radio stations, like what it did in a number of countries including
Eastern European states, Khamenei said, quoted by the official IRNA
news agency.
</P>
<P>
"Some segments of the press" are concentrating efforts on
inciting the public, sowing discord and making the people pessimist
about the social system, he said.
</P>
<P>
The leader called on the press to respect the constitution and
Islamic value, enlighten people, safeguard the country's interests
and write in the interest of the people and Islam.
</P>
<P>
The warning comes when political struggle in the country becomes
heated following February's parliamentary elections, in which
reformers allied to President Mohammad Khatami won an overwhelming
victory, ending the long time conservative majority in the
legislative body.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei's words echo the effort to take counter-measures
against the reformists by the conservatives, who are still in
control of most of the country's powerful organs and unwilling to
accept the humiliating defeat.
</P>
<P>
One of the steps they took is was limit the activities of
reformist newspapers, which they think are the major tools
reformers use to win support from the people.
</P>
<P>
The conservatives have summoned a number of famous journalists
and publishers to courts on charges of defamation or propagating
against Islamic values, even sending some of them to prison.
</P>
<P>
The outgoing conservative parliament has also passed an
amendment to the press law as part of the effort to curb the
reformist press.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh to Achieve 65 Percent Literacy by End of 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 20 (Xinhua) -- The rate of literacy in Bangladesh
is expected to reach 65 percent by the end of this year due to
implementation of a range of programs in the education sector,
officials of the Directorate of Non-Formal Education (DNFE) said
here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The government programs as well as those of Non-Government
Organizations (NGOs) have led the rate of literacy to nearly 60
percent by now, and the total success in literacy is expected to
be achieved by the year 2006, they said.
</P>
<P>
During the implementation of the programs to stamp out
illiteracy from the country in the education sector, the DNFE has
been playing a leading role with its four high-profile projects in
more than half of the country's 64 districts.
</P>
<P>
DNFE officials said that as many as 35 million target
population aged 11 to 35 years had been getting non-formal
education through the Total Literacy Movement and the Center-Based
Approach.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-five million young and adult people would be able to
read and write under the Non-Foramal Education Program which will
end next year, they said, adding that Bangladesh is being seen as
a role model by similar countries in the world as the government
together with NGOs is bringing about a tremendous success in the
field of education.
</P>
<P>
The Asian Development Bank, the Swiss Agency for Development
and Cooperation, the United States Agency for International
Development, the Norwegian Agency for International Development
and the United Nations Children's Fund are the donor partners of
the government for these projects.
</P>
<P>
DNFE officials said the main objective of the DNFE's national
literacy program is not only to raise the rate of literacy among
youths and adults, but also to reduce gap in literacy between
males and females as well as gap between urban and rural areas.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Reform Tops Nepal Development Forum  by Zhuang Meijie, Song Dejun </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, April 20 (Xinhua) -- The three-day Nepal Development
Forum (NDF) meeting ended in Paris Wednesday with donor countries
committing more financial aid to Nepal while urging the Nepali
government to carry out further reform.
</P>
<P>
The 23 bilateral and multilateral donors participating the
forum reaffirmed their resolve to assist Nepal in addressing the
challenge of poverty alleviation and economic growth, and agreed
to extend a financial assistance of up to 1,250 million U.S.
dollars during 2000-2001.
</P>
<P>
However, the donors emphasized that actual levels of assistance
will depend on the progress in policy and institutional reform and
improvements in the effective utilization of the aid, promising
that aid levels could be higher if the pace of reform is
accelerated.
</P>
<P>
Nepal is one of the poorest countries in the world, with an
annual per capita income of merely 200 U.S. dollars and about 45
percent of its 22 million population living below the poverty line.
About 60 percent of the country's development fund came from
foreign aid.
</P>
<P>
The donors, however, had complained about the improper use of
the aid money due to poor governance and insisted the aid would be
linked with the performance of the Nepali government.
</P>
<P>
To respond to the donors request for reforms, Nepali Finance
Minister Mahesh Acharya presented an economic reforms package at
the forum.
</P>
<P>
The package encompassed macro-economic restructuring, civil
service reform, anti-corruption initiatives, decentralization,
financial sector and private sector development, aid effectiveness,
and so on.
</P>
<P>
The reform program aims to increase the ratio of public revenue
and gross domestic production, control government expenditure,
keep the GDP and net internal loan ratio under 0.5 percent, bring
auditing of fiscal and industrial sectors at par with
international standard, frame laws about liquidation of industries.
</P>
<P>
The Nepali government also pledged to deliver good governance
and reduce corruption by toning up administration, streamlining
ministries, departments and other offices.
</P>
<P>
The donors were impressed by Nepal's commitment for reform, but
"expressed concern for effective implementation of the reform,"
said Hans Rothenbuhler, Country Director of World Bank Nepal
Office, at a video press conference held immediately after the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
At the forum, the Nepali government also appealed for the
donors to ease the stringent conditionalities attached to aid and
change the way they disburse the loans.
</P>
<P>
"We clearly told the donors that the conditionalities tied up
with aid and their aid disbursement practices were cumbersome and
they agreed on the need to reform themselves in this area," said
Acharya at the press conference.
</P>
<P>
Discussion on poverty alleviation strategy was another
important agenda during the meeting. The National Planning
Commission of Nepal presented a Poverty Alleviation Strategy at
the meeting, which was, according to the finance minister,
endorsed by the donors.
</P>
<P>
Apart from development projects, poverty alleviation had
absorbed much of the foreign aid flowing to Nepal. The Nepali
government aims to reduce the poverty level to 10 percent within a
decade, which will prove to be a tough task.
</P>
<P>
The NDF meeting, usually held every two years between Nepal and
its development partners, was held at an interval of four years
this time due to political instability in Nepal.
</P>
<P>
The donors had pledged a financial assistance of one billion U.
S. dollars at their last meeting, but only about half of it has
been disbursed.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Close to Achieving Zero Poppy Cultivation: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan has fulfilled its
international commitment to eradicating production of poppy crop
in the country by bringing it at almost zero level, said a senior
official here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Secretary of Pakistan's Narcotics Division Muhammad Aziz Khan
told the Associated Press of Pakistan (APP) that there is a minor
spot in Khyber agency of North West Frontier province where the
poppy crop is still being cultivated, adding that the government
is "determined to wash out this menace" soon.
</P>
<P>
NWFP, bordering Afghanistan, once was one of the areas where
poppy was a popular crop.
</P>
<P>
"We have been succeeded to do away with the production of poppy
and confide to achieve zero level poppy cultivation by the end of
year 2000," he stated.
</P>
<P>
Khan said Pakistan's achievement has been appreciated by the
international community.
</P>
<P>
"We have a success story, because Pakistan will no longer be a
drug-producing country," he said.
</P>
<P>
As far as drug addiction is concerned, he said the government
is "fully concerned" over this menace and taking all possible
steps to control it.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan, he said, is constantly in touch with the
international agencies to extend all possible cooperation to
effectively deal with this problem.

BEIJING, April 20 (Xinhua) -- The People's Daily, China's
leading newspaper, will publish a special commentary tomorrow
concerning the Party's decision to expel Cheng Kejie, a corrupt
senior official.
</P>
<P>
"There Is No Hiding Place for Corrupt Elements in the Party"

chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's
Congress and former chairmen of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous
Region, for abusing his power, taking bribes and leading a
dissipated life.
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party of China Central Committee with Jiang Zemin
at the core has always put emphasis on discipline and made greater
efforts in fighting against corruption, the article says.

In recent years, a number of ranking officials including Chen
Xitong, Wang Baosen and Hu Changqing have been punished for
breaking the law and violating the Party discipline. The

corruption as that between fire and water.
</P>

"Our Party will definitely show no mercy" toward corrupt
officials, regardless of their rank or position, the article says.
The Party is confident and capable of eliminating corruption and
maintaining honesty, it adds, pledging, "there are no hiding
places in the Party for corruptive officials"

said on Wednesday in Lausanne, Switzerland.

preparation for the Athens Games.
</P>
<P>
"If from now until the end of the year there are no drastic
changes, we will enter the red phase."

Samaranch had told the Greeks that organizing the games
involves three phases: "green" where everything is proceeding
smoothly, "yellow" where there are "many problems," and red where
the "games are in danger."

<P>
BEIJING, April 20 (Xinhua) -- China's prestigious CITIC group
has reached an agreement with the British Prudential Plc to start
a joint life and health insurance company in south China's
Guangzhou City.
</P>
<P>
Each side will have a 50 percent stake in the joint venture,
which will require an investment of 23 million U.S. dollars, the
two sides announced at a press conference today.
</P>
<P>
Dominic Leung, managing director of the joint venture, said an
application for license has been submitted to the China Insurance
Regulatory Commission (CIRC) and that he expects the joint venture
to be operational by the third quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
Established in 1979, CITIC, or China International Trust and
Investment Company, had a unique and important function in the
early stages of China's opening to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
It has grown into a multinational group with assets worth 32.5
billion dollars. The company has a large variety of businesses
ranging from banking and securities to leasing, with the exception
of insurance.
</P>
<P>
Hence, Chang Zhenming, deputy president of CITIC, said going
into insurance marks a strategic step in the development of the
company.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that CITIC is also planning to get into property
insurance.
</P>

In May 1999, Prudential Plc, the largest life and health
insurance company in Britain, was approved by the CIRC to operate
in China. It is the first British insurer to the go-ahead in China.
</P>
<P>
The two sides signed an memo of understanding for the joint
venture last December and signed the formal contract early this
month in London.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Detects First Internet Piracy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
During the anti-piracy operation, officers from the Customs
Intellectual Property Investigation Bureau smashed an internet
piracy syndicate and seized 20,000 HK dollars (2560 U.S. dollars)
worth of computer equipment.
</P>
<P>
Officers arrested two men, aged between 28 and 31, including
the mastermind of the syndicate, and seized a computer server, a
desktop and other related equipment.
</P>
<P>
The suspected pirates in this case make use of the computer
server to save the pirated software onto the homepage of the
internet for the public to download the software free of charge.
In return, they could make money by attracting advertisements.
</P>
<P>
To tackle the online piracy problem, the department has sent
members of the Anti-internet Piracy Team to the Cyber smuggling
Center in Virginia, United states to undergo a week-long training
on ways to curb internet piracy activities.
</P>
<P>
Locally, the Department, with the assistance of the U.S.
Customs Service, has just run a four-day Cyber Investigation
Seminar.
</P>
<P>
"Internet piracy is a new challenge to the Hong Kong Customs,"
the Assistant Commissioner of Customs and Excise (Control and
Intellectual Property) Vincent Poon Yeung-kwong Thursday addressed
the closing ceremony of the Seminar.
</P>
<P>
"Cyber investigation is a deep and enormous subject," he noted.
He pointed out that the seminar, concluded today, was to lay a
foundation for the participants to further their study into cyber
investigation and computer forensics in future.
</P>
<P>
"Taking on the success of this seminar, we look forward to
arranging similar training in the future with the US Customs
Service and other enforcement agencies with a view to fully
equipping our officers for the new challenges ahead," Poon said.
</P>
<P>
Also speaking at the event, James Dozier, a senior customs
representative of the American Consulate General, paid tribute to
the Hong Kong Customs for its support, cooperation and
coordination to make the seminar possible.
</P>
<P>
Dozier noted that cyber smuggling was the wave of the present
and future regarding criminal activity.
</P>
<P>
He said in order to combat that global issue, it was imperative
to have international cooperation between law enforcement agencies
in this arena.
</P>
<P>
At the closing ceremony, 58 course members were presented a
graduation certificate in recognition of their achievements made
when attending the seminar.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Customs officers seized 16.5 million pirated optical
discs, worth $290 million, and arrested 2,701 people. In the first
two months of this year, the officers seized 1.69 million pirated
optical discs with a market value of 32 million HK dollars (over 4
million U.S. dollars), and arrested 544 suspects.

<HEADLINE> HK Official Optimistic About Opportunities on Mainland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wrapping up his recent visit to Chongqing, Lee said his
sanguine outlook was based on his assessment of the business
prospects of local construction sector, given its advantageous
position in getting a share in the flourishing construction market
on the Mainland.
</P>
<P>
"In vying for works contracts, the construction sector of Hong
Kong will surely have an edge over its overseas competitors in
terms of its advantageous geographical location, the remarkable
track record in the many world-class infrastructural projects and,
more importantly, its close relationship with the mainland on the
social, economical and culture aspects," he said.
</P>
<P>
Lee also pointed out that given the impending accession of
China to the World Trade Organization (WTO), the construction
market on the Mainland would open to Hong Kong's construction
sector to expand their business activities.
</P>
<P>
Earlier last week, Lee led a delegation to Chongqing to attend
a construction conference jointly organized by the Works Bureau
and the Ministry of Construction (MOC).

<HEADLINE> Li Peng Meets Ukrainian Chairman of Supreme Court Vitaly Boiko </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Li Peng, chairman of the Standing
Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC), met here today
with Vitaly Boiko, Ukrainian chairman of the Supreme Court, who
arrived here Wednesday for a week-long visit.
</P>
<P>
Li spoke highly of the relationship between China and Ukraine.
He said that China and Ukraine have maintained friendly,
cooperative relations in various fields since the two countries
established diplomatic relations eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the two countries exchange visits frequently, and
the two sides have conducted cooperation of mutual benefit in
economic areas, and have supported each other in international
affairs, Li noted.
</P>
<P>
The swaps of visits between leaders of the supreme courts of
China and Ukraine have played an important role in the exchange
and cooperation in the judiciary systems of the two countries, Li
said.
</P>
<P>
The NPC chairman told the Ukraine guest that China has written
into its constitution the principle of "ruling the country by law
and building a socialist country based on the rule of law." This
shows that China has entered a new era in building a socialist
democracy and legal system.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Li said that the supervising role of the NPC is
being strengthened in China.
</P>
<P>
Boiko said that Ukraine-China relations have been very good,
and the cooperation between the two supreme courts has been very
fruitful.
</P>
<P>
Boiko said his country is trying to build a legal and law-
enforcement system that is suited to the specific conditions of
Ukraine. Ukraine wants to learn from China in that process.
</P>
<P>
Boiko handed to Li a letter written by Ivan Plyushch, chairman
of the Supreme Council of Ukraine, who has invited Li to pay an
official visit to Ukraine. Li expressed his thanks.
</P>
<P>
Xiao Yang, president of China's Supreme People's Court, who
signed a cooperation agreement with his Ukrainian counterpart
Wednesday, was present at the meeting.

<HEADLINE> Top Legislature to Inspect Enforcement of Law on Rural Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 20 (Xinhua) -- To support the growth of rural
enterprises and regulate their operation, China's National People'
s Congress (NPC) Standing Committee will send four inspection
teams to the countryside to see how effectively the Law on Rural
Enterprises is being enforced.
</P>
<P>
The inspection teams, headed by Buhe, vice chairman of the NPC
Standing Committee, will go to Henan, Shaanxi, Zhejiang, Jiangxi,
Shandong, Liaoning, Hunan Provinces and Chongqing Municipality
next month.
</P>
<P>
The inspection teams will also ask the standing committees of
provincial people's congresses of Jiangsu, Sichuan, Gansu and
Yunnan to carry out the same inspections and report to the NPC
Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
Rural enterprises involve mainly those collectively-owned
enterprises in the countryside that enjoy some preferential tax
policies. The enterprises also are responsible for supporting
local agricultural development.
</P>
<P>
At the first meeting of the inspection teams held here today,
Buhe noted that healthy development of rural enterprises is needed
for the smooth operation of the national economy.
</P>
<P>
The inspection will focus on how the authorities implement the
law, regulating operation of the rural enterprises and protecting
the legitimate rights of the enterprises.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, ministers from 13 ministries and a vice
president of Supreme People's Court delivered reports on the
enforcement of the law.
</P>
<P>
Statistics showed that in 1999, there were 20.71 million rural
enterprises across the country with 127 million employees. The
rural enterprises produced an added value of 2488.3 billion yuan
and paid 179 billion yuan in taxes.
</P>
<P>
However, some problems have emerged during the development of
rural enterprises. For instance, their profits are on the decline,
their product quality is generally poor and some have become the
major polluters in their localities.

<HEADLINE> Lawmaker: Development of West Not at Cost of Ecological Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 20 (Xinhua) -- A senior lawmaker stressed here
today that China will balance economic growth and environmental
protection in the massive western development plan.
</P>
<P>
Zou Jiahua, Vice-Chairman of the Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress (NPC) made the remarks at a meeting on
environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
Zou said the introduction of foreign technology, arrangement of
cooperative programs between the coastal and western regions as
well as the local development programs will not be launched at the
cost of the environment in the western regions.
</P>
<P>
He believed that the development of the west will push ahead
the country's economic and social growth. And though the western
region has a shortage of water and is seeing worsening natural
conditions compared with the coastal areas, the development of the
west should focus on both building a brisk economy and improving
the environment.
</P>
<P>
Zou emphasized that the western development requires the strong
support of the coastal areas, and the coastal areas also need a
larger market for their own further growth.
</P>
<P>
He said that if the environment in the west is destroyed, this
will not only hinder the development of the west, it will
ultimately have a negative impact on the coastal areas.
</P>
<P>
During the development of the west, local governments will not
only solve the ongoing pollution problems, but also pay more
attention to the prevention of new pollution sources and
improvement of the environment, Zou said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the protection of virgin forests, afforestation,
and rational development of water resources should hinge on
advancement of science and technology.

<HEADLINE> China to Reform Key Laboratories </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 20 (Xinhua) -- China will reform its 153 key
laboratories which have contributed greatly to the country's
scientific research and development.
</P>
<P>
Some labs which are behind the times with poor research
equipment and facilities will be cut from the list of state key
labs, and a group of labs which are involved in new and promising
scientific research fields will be selected or built, according to
the Beijing-based newspaper Science Times.
</P>
<P>
Since 1984, China has invested 1.4 billion yuan (169 million US
dollars) to build 156 state key laboratories to cover most of the
basic research fields, but only 153 have survived.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that in 1997, the 153 labs had 4,340 permanent
researchers and 14,633 temporary employees, while the total amount
of equipment and facilities was only worth 1.88 billion yuan (
about 226.5 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Shortage of research funding has become a major problem for the
survival and development of these labs. In the future, the central
government will give them more latitude in introducing financing
from outside the research institutes and cooperating with other
organizations.
</P>
<P>
The reform will also focus on increasing the innovation work
done in the labs and employing more outstanding young scientists,
according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
China will unite the labs which are doing similar research work,
and eliminate those which can no longer meet the need of the
scientific development.

<HEADLINE> UAE Reopens Embassy in Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, April 20 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates (UAE)
reopened its embassy in the Iraqi capital Baghdad on Thursday,
marking a full recovery of their bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, UAE Charge D'affaires in Baghdad Ahmed Abdulla
Bin Saeed said the reopening of the embassy is "a beginning of good
and enhanced relations between the two brotherly countries to serve
their joint interests."
</P>
<P>
Addressing the reopening ceremony, Iraqi Foreign Ministry
Undersecretary Nabiel Najim hailed the UAE move a step forward to
enhance the Arab solidarity.
</P>
<P>
"The reopening of the embassy is to ensure the life interaction
between the brotherly Arabs in confronting the dangers that the
Arab nations face," he was quoted by the Iraqi News Agency as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Iraq is also expected to reopen its consulate in Dubai, the
commercial center of the UAE, in the coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
The UAE severed its relations with Iraq after the latter invaded
Kuwait in 1990 and took part in the U.S.-led multinational
coalition that drove the Iraqi occupation army out of Kuwait during
the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
However, bilateral relations, especially trade ties, have been
steadily improving in recent years. Trade volume between the two
countries, within the framework of the U.N. oil-for-food program,
has reached 400 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Under the U.N. humanitarian deal, launched in December 1996,
Iraq is allowed to export a limited amount of crude to finance
imports of food, medicine and other humanitarian supplies for its
22 million people, who have been badly affected by the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
UAE President Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al-Nahyan has called for
lifting the trade embargo on Iraq, emphasizing the necessity of
ending the sufferings of the Iraqi people and restoring normal
relations among Arab nations.
</P>
<P>
Three of the six Gulf Cooperation Council member states--
Bahrain, Oman and Qatar--had renewed diplomatic ties with Iraq.

<HEADLINE> GCC's Stand on Iraq United: GCC Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Secretary General of the Gulf
Cooperation Council (GCC) Jameel al-Hujailan said that the GCC
stand on Iraq is united and goes in line with the previous joint
statements issued by the alliance.
</P>
<P>
In an interview which will appear on the Saturday issue of
Kuwait's Arabic weekly magazine Al Zaman (Time), al-Hujailan said
that he did not believe there are conflicting stands among the GCC
members on the Iraqi government, adding that the GCC stand is
clearly specified in its previous statements.
</P>
<P>
The Riyadh-based GCC comprises Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar,
Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).
</P>
<P>
"Diplomatic relations between some GCC states and Baghdad were
never cut off in the first place, but some states withdrew their
diplomatic representation from Iraq" after Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait in 1990, al-Hujailan said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that "if these countries resume their relations with
Iraq today, it would be within their sovereign rights, and if
anyone wants to review the political position of the GCC, then they
have to go back to the group's statements."
</P>
<P>
Al-Hujailan's remarks came after Bahrain announced in early
April that it would reopen its embassy in Baghdad on "humanitarian
grounds" after a 10-year break.
</P>
<P>
Four GCC members--Bahrain, Oman, Qatar and the United Arab
Emirates--have renewed their diplomatic representation in Baghdad.
Kuwait and Saudi Arabia have not re-established ties with Iraq
since the 1991 Gulf War.

<HEADLINE> Iranian, Lebanese Presidents on Bilateral Ties, Regional Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad Khatami
and his Lebanese counterpart Emile Lahoud here Thursday exchanged
views on strengthening bilateral ties and promoting regional peace
and stability, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Iran is willing to cement political, economic, social,
scientific and cultural ties with Lebanon, Khatami told Lahoud, who
arrived here Wednesday afternoon leading a high-ranking delegation.
</P>
<P>
Khatami stressed that Iran is interested in regional peace and
stability. But no peace will be durable unless it is based on
justice and restoration of rights of all regional nations, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
On Israel's planned troop withdrawal from south Lebanon by July,
Khatami said that the resistance movement in Lebanon has been the
major cause for such a move.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed the hope that all occupied Arab lands will be
liberated and all homeless Palestinians will return to their
homeland peacefully.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Lahoud appreciated Iran's long time support for
Lebanon's resistance against Israeli occupation, stressing that
Iran's backing contributed to the upcoming withdrawal of the
Israeli forces. He also called for further expansion of Tehran-
Beirut relations in all areas.
</P>
<P>
Israeli troops have occupied parts of southern Lebanon since
1978. They set up a self-styled security zone there in 1985 with a
claimed aim of protecting its north from cross-border attacks by
Lebanese guerrilla groups.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah, or Party of God, backed by Iran and Syria, has since
been spearheading a guerrilla war to oust Israeli forces and their
allied South Lebanon Army (SLA) from the country.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli cabinet last month endorsed Prime Minister Ehud
Barak's pledge to pull out Israeli soldiers from south Lebanon by
July 7, with or without a peace agreement with Lebanon and its
major power broker Syria.
</P>
<P>
Lahoud also met with Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi on
Thursday, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Iran is the sixth leg of Lahoud's regional tour, which has taken
him to Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and
Bahrain and will take him to Egypt.

<HEADLINE> Ghana's Opposition Party Calls for Immediate Address to Currency Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Ghana's main opposition New
Patriotic Party (NPP) Wednesday urged the parliament to set up a
bi-partisan committee to assist the Minister of Finance in
stopping the alarming plunge of the national currency, the cedi.
</P>
<P>
The Ghana News Agency Thursday quoted the party's presidential
candidate, John Kufuor as saying that "the committee should
outline proposals that will reduce corruption and capital flight
and propose lasting measures to strengthen our currency and
suggests policies to deal with the economic crisis."
</P>
<P>
The Ghanaian currency had depreciated about 33 percent at the
end of 1999 and 28 percent in the first quarter of 2000 against
the U.S. dollar, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
In order to reduce pressure on the cedi, the government must
"now prepared to live within its means," and take immediate
measures to ensure companies comply with the foreign exchange
retention regulations, said the opposition party leader.
</P>
<P>
He said he disagreed with the government's attempt to blame the
economic problems on the rise in petroleum prices and the decline
in gold price, saying "the fault is not outside this country, it
is inside Ghana."

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Africa lost some two billion U.S.
dollars annually due to Malaria and related diseases in recent
years, the regional director of the World Health Organization
(WTO) said.
</P>
<P>
The figure is expected to reach 3.6 billion dollars this year,
Ebrahim Samba said on Wednesday in Nigerian capital Abuja, which
would host a summit of African states to roll back the scourge
next week, the News Agency of Nigeria reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Samba, in the country for the summit, said in some African
countries Malaria was "responsible for between 30 and 50 percent
of outpatients" and 15 percent of hospital admissions.
</P>
<P>
He said the objective of the summit, which has the support of
the Geneva based organization, was a "progressive reduction of
deaths due to malaria by 50 percent by 2010, another 30 percent
and 20 percent respectively by 2015 and 2025.
</P>
<P>
A key feature of the program is its multi-faceted approach,
including the mobilization of a global coalition that would
include the leaders of endemic countries, United Nations
agencies, non-governmental agencies and the scientific community.
</P>
<P>
The director said some 50 African leaders, leaders of eight
leading industrial countries and 10 international development
agencies have been invited to the Abuja summit, expected to be
opened by Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo on April 24.

<HEADLINE> Parents of Belgian Boys to Pay for Train Crash Damages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Parents of three boys who caused
a train crash in Belgium rail line on Tuesday have to pay for part
of damages of millions of Belgian francs, local media said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Three boys, aged 8, 9 and 13 respectively, have confessed that
they had put a concrete block on a crucial switch in a hope to
watch a train crash.
</P>
<P>
The train at a high speed rammed into another coming from the
opposite direction. One of the train drivers was killed and many
passengers injured in the accident.
</P>
<P>
In Belgium, a family insurance usually covers damages caused by
children, also when they do so on purpose. But the amount paid by
the insurance company is limited. Therefore, the parents need to
pay the rest.
</P>
<P>
The Belgian national railway company estimated that the damages
may run into millions of Belgian francs, not including the removal
of the wreckage, deviations and delays.
</P>
<P>
The accident happened on the line between Namur and Charleroi
in southern Belgium. By Thursday morning, the line was cleared and
traffic returned to normal.

<HEADLINE> French Publisher Withdraws Camus' "Journal" for Suspected Anti- Semitism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 20 (Xinhua) -- The French publishing house
Editions Fayard on Thursday withdrew a diary book for containing
suspected anti-Semitism.
</P>
<P>
Fayard has asked all bookstores to withdraw copies of "Journal"
by Renaud Camus, because the book risks to provoke a dispute, said
the general director of the publishing house, Olivier Betourne.
</P>
<P>
Two leading media figures of France Wednesday condemned the
book for criticizing the large presence of Jews in a radio and
television program, France Culture.
</P>
<P>
Jean-Marie Cavada, the president of Radio France, and Laure
Adler, director of France Culture, expressed their indignation at
the book and threatened to launch lawsuit against its writer and
publisher.
</P>
<P>
The Minister of Culture and Communication, Catherine Tasca, has
also expressed her discontent about the book.
</P>
<P>
Camus said in the book that the Jews in the "Panorama" program
of France Culture are "over-represented as an ethnic and religious
group."
</P>
<P>
He also criticized France Culture for making at least one
program each week on "Jewish culture, Jewish religion, Jewish
writers, the state of Israel and its policy, the life of Jews in
France and in the world today or through the centuries."
</P>
<P>
France strictly bans books with anti-Semitic connotation.
</P>
<P>
Writer Roger Garaudy was condemned two years ago for publishing
a book in which he expressed doubt over the official number of
Jews who were killed in the Holocaust.

<HEADLINE> Pudong Emphasizes Ecological Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the Lujiazui Financial and Trade Zone, known as China's "
Wall Street," is a collection of gleaming high-rise financial
buildings. Every inch of land there is expensive, but city
planners, after consulting international designers, went ahead
with construction of the park's 140 hectares.
</P>
<P>
The Central Park, with an expanse of lawn, artificial hills,
and pavilions, has become a tourist attraction, receiving 700,000
visitors so far.
</P>
<P>
The park, which connects with the 5.5-kilometer Boulevard
Century, has boosted property sales in surrounding areas. One
residential quarter, Tianan Huayuan, is among the beneficiaries as
its housing prices there have jumped from 4,500 yuan to 6,300 yuan
per square meter.
</P>
<P>
Another famed ecological project is in Zhangjiabang, where the
government tackled pollution in a river with 250 million yuan (
about 30 US dollars). The river has helped increase tourism
earnings as well as real estate profits.
</P>
<P>
At present, Pudong's annual tourism earnings stand at 1.1
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, green space per capita has
risen to 7.77 square meters from 0.54 square meters, while
pollution in 90 percent of Pudong has been controlled.
</P>
<P>
China began developing the 522-square-kilometer area on the
eastern side of Huangpu River on April 18, 1990, in a drive to
reinvigorate Shanghai as an international trade and financial
center.
</P>
<P>
Pudong New Area Administrative Committee officials said they
have realized that a sound ecological environment is also
necessary for attracting foreign investment.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientists Boast Spacecraft Welding Techniques </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, April 20 (Xinhua) -- China has successfully applied
advanced welding techniques to the building of its first
outerspace aircraft, named "shenzhou", which was launched last
November, according to a recent appraisal by a committee made up
of members of Chinese Academy of Sciences and Academy of
Engineering of China.
</P>
<P>
The techniques, combination welding and deformation control,
were applied to the return cabin of the experimental spacecraft,
which touched down without any damage, fully indicating that China
's spacecraft welding technique is mature and has reached the
world advanced level.
</P>
<P>
Joint efforts have been made by the National Key Lab of Modern
Welding Technology at Harbin Polytechnical University and the
Chinese Research Institute of Space Technology (CRIST) for the
techniques.
</P>
<P>
Wang Chunqing, deputy director with the lab, said that the
shell of the spacecraft's return cabin, which is no more than two-
millimeter thick, is usually made of aluminum alloy. Any
deformation during the welding process might lead to breach caused
by heat when the return cabin falls down.
</P>
<P>
With the help of precise clamping apparatus developed by China
and other new techniques, experts successfully solved the welding
problems on a 70-meter-long welding line on the cabin shell, which
stood the test of the return.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that his lab and CRIST are cooperating in the
development of a technique of automatic welding of space curve and
a technique of forecast of welding deformation on thin shells.
</P>
<P>
He said the two techniques will enhance China's level on the
shell-welding of spacecrafts and set a solid ground for the future
launch of manned spacecraft.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Chinese historians are looking to
the past to find solutions to modern-day problems in the border
areas.
</P>
<P>
A new study on borderlands will take an in-depth look at
historic events in those areas, said Ma Dazheng, director of the
Research Center for Chinese Borderland History and Geography under
the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS).
</P>
<P>
The research center formulated a 12-year plan extending from
1990 to 2001, listing Xinjiang Uygur and Tibet autonomous regions,
northeast China, Yunnan Province and the Nansha Islands as four
key study points, Ma said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the center organized experts to compile five sets of
academic books and journals. A seven-volume General History of
Chinese Borderland, with more than six million Chinese characters,
will be published in the next couple of years.
</P>
<P>
The center, established in 1983, remains the only research body
on borderland history in the People's Republic.
</P>
<P>
Descriptions on borderland history and geography in ancient
times can be found in inscriptions on bones and tortoise shells of
the Shang Dynasty (16th-11th century B.C.).

Yuan Chunqing, a spokesman for the Central Commission for
Discipline Inspection, said that as a senior government official,
Cheng abused his power to take bribes and make huge amounts of
illicit profits, turning himself into a typical corrupt official.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman pointed out that Cheng's degeneration happened
mainly because he abandoned his ideals and belief in communism,
fell victim to the temptations of women and money, and took
advantage of the power endowed by the Party and the people as a
tool to make personal gains.
</P>
<P>
Yuan added that every Party member and government official,
especially those high-ranking ones, should learn from Cheng's case
and stick to the three emphases of theoretical study, political
awareness and honest conduct.
</P>
<P>
He said that the investigation of Cheng's case demonstrates the
determination of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Jiang
Zemin at the core to rule the country in accordance with law and
the principle that Party and government officials, no matter who
they are, are subject to punishment if they violate the law.

In another case, Cheng got 2.2 million yuan in illicit profits
by designating one company as the contractor of a construction
project and helping another company to get bank loans.
</P>
<P>
From 1994 to 1998, Cheng took 595,000 yuan, 35,000 US dollars
and 20,000 HK dollars of bribes from 13 government officials,
including a deputy secretary-general, surnamed Gan, of the people'

return were given promotions and granted transfer of posts.
</P>
<P>
During 1992-1997, at the request of Li Ping, Cheng helped Li
and other merchants get land contracts and quotas for low-priced
white sugar, fertilizer and vegetable oil. After further trading,
illicit profits of some 9.03 million yuan were made.
</P>
<P>
Cheng has acknowledged that the above-mentioned illicit profits
were made by Li Ping and himself, and expressed his willingness to
return all of the money to the state coffer.

</P>
<P>
From 1994 through 1997, with Li Ping acting as an intermediary,

<HEADLINE> U.S. Congressman Concludes Landmark Visit to Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, April 20 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Democratic Party Congressman
Tony Hall left here Thursday after concluding his landmark visit to
Iraq, which has been under sweeping U.N. sanctions since 1990.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Hall expressed regret over the negative impacts
of the decade-old sanctions on Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
During his four-day stay, Hall visited hospitals and health
institutions in Baghdad and the southern Muthana Province.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. lawmaker got acquainted with the sufferings of the
Iraqi children because of acute shortage of food and medicine as a
direct result of the embargo, reported the Iraqi News Agency (INA).
</P>
<P>
He also witnessed cases of malnutrition and poliomyelitis that
have doubled since 1990, when U.N. imposed the sanctions against
Iraq for its invasion of Kuwait, said the INA.
</P>
<P>
Hall said on Monday that he regretted the miserable humanitarian
situation in Iraq while visiting a hospital in the Mansour district
of the Iraqi capital.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has claimed that over 1.2 million people, mostly children
and the elderly, have died during the last 10 years, and blames the
deaths on shortages of food, medicine and other essential supplies.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been accusing the U.S. and Britain of deliberately
impeding the implementation of the U.N. oil-for-food deal which
allows Baghdad to sell oil under U.N. supervision, thus worsening
the humanitarian crisis in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Hall's landmark visit to Iraq started on Sunday evening when he
arrived here by land from Amman, Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Upon arrival, Hall said that his visit, the first of its kind by
an American congressman since the 1991 Gulf War, was not political
but humanitarian.
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of issues I want to look at, but the issue of
humanitarian concerns is number one," he said.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Expects 20m Ton Wheat Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If the target is met, there will be no need of importing wheat
thus saving 700 million rupees (13.4 million U.S.dollars) of
foreign exchange, official sources said.
</P>
<P>
According to details, the country needs an estimated 19 million
tons of wheat for its domestic requirements.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, 18 million ton wheat was produced in the South Asian
country whereas 1.6 million wheat was imported to meet the
shortfall.
</P>
<P>
The current government has offered more incentives to farmers
aimed at increasing wheat production and achieving self-reliance
in agriculture sector.
</P>
<P>
The increase in the procuring price of the crop was the most
significant motivation for the farmers to grow more wheat than the
previous year. The government has enhanced wheat price from 240
rupees (4.6 dollars) per kilogram to 300 rupees (5.8 dollars) per
kilogram.
</P>
<P>
In Punjab, the main wheat-growing province, the crop was
cultivated this year at 1.544 million acres of land, 5.1 percent
higher than the last year. Wheat production in Punjab is expected
about 14.5 million tons which is 300,000 tons more than the target
set at the beginning of the season.

<HEADLINE> Police Say Separatist Group Prime Suspect of Bomb Attack in France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 20 (Xinhua) -- French police said on Thursday that
a separatist group called "Brittany Revolutionary Army (ARB)" was
the prime suspect in a bomb attack on Wednesday against a
McDonald's restaurant in Brittany.
</P>
<P>
The attack, which took place near the Brittany city of Dinan,
killed a 27-year-old woman worker of the restaurant and triggered
widespread condemnation in France.
</P>
<P>
Investigators said that the bombing device used in the attack
was the same as those stolen in September last year by the ARB and
the Basque separatist group ETA from an ammunitions stock in
Plevin, Brittany.
</P>
<P>
French officials said that the ARB has provided the ETA with
logistical support.
</P>
<P>
Police said that a bombing device defused on Wednesday outside
a post office in Rennes, the capital of Brittany, also came from
the stolen materials.
</P>
<P>
So far no one has claimed responsibility for Wednesday's attack,
which was the first deadly one since the ARB launched its campaign
for independence of Brittany, a historically Celtic region, from
France years ago.

<HEADLINE> Small Loans Help Chinese Farmers Escape Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Fang Jian, a poor farmer in
Shangnan county in northwest China's Shaanxi Province, is now
leading a better life thanks to a loan provided by the local
agricultural bank.
</P>
<P>
With a meager annual income of 2,500 yuan (about 300 US dollars)
for his five-member family, Fang used to have a very hard life. In
March last year, he borrowed 2,000 yuan from the county's
agricultural bank and used the money to grow mushrooms and herbs,
earning 5,000 yuan (about 600 dollars) by the year end.
</P>
<P>
Like Fang, more than two hundred of his villagers also escaped
poverty through growing cash crops with financial assistance from
the local agricultural banks.
</P>
<P>
The system of small loans was introduced to China in the mid-
1990s. Agricultural banks and branches give loans of 1,000-3,000
yuan (120-360 dollars) to poor farmers.
</P>
<P>
According to local officials, 97 percent of the destitute
families in Shangluo prefecture in Shaanxi received small loans.

<HEADLINE> More Power Stations To Be Built on Upper Reaches of Yellow River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, April 20 (Xinhua) -- China plans to build more hydro-
power stations on the upper reaches of the Yellow River in the
next few years to tap rich electric power resources in the area.
</P>
<P>
An official in charge of the China National Electric Power
Company said that some of the large and medium-sized projects will
start this year.
</P>
<P>
The 918-kilometer-long section of the Yellow River between the
Longyang Gorge in Qinghai Province and Qingtong Gorge in the
Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region has a 1,324 meter drop, containing
great potential for developing electric power.
</P>
<P>
The official said that 25 large and medium-sized power stations
designated have a combined installed capacity of 15.878 million
kilowatts, generating 56.77 billion kilowatt hours of electricity
annually.
</P>
<P>
Seven power stations completed or under construction boast a
combined installed capacity of 5.618 million kilowatts. Only one-
third of the total hydropower resources in the upper reaches of
the Yellow River have been developed.
</P>
<P>
With the construction of these power projects, the hydro-power
resources in the upper reaches of the Yellow River will be fully
exploited.
</P>
<P>
The 5,400-km-long Yellow River originates in the Qinghai-Tibet
plateau in northwest China, runs through nine provinces and
autonomous regions, and flows into the Bohai Sea in east China.

<HEADLINE> Wrapup: Chinese FM Spokesman's Remarks at Press Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Chinese trade minister Shi
Guangsheng has invited the European Union (EU) delegation to come
again to Beijing for talks concerning China's entry into the World
Trade Organization (WTO), Foreign Ministry spokesman Sun Yuxi said
today.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said at a regular press conference that he
believes the two sides will "very soon" begin a new round of talks
on China's WTO accession.
</P>
<P>
Sun said China hopes the United States government will come
back to the track of dialogue on the human rights issue as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. side needs to show some concrete deeds in this
respect," he said, adding that Sino-U.S. relations, on the whole,
have gradually improved and developed in the past year, thanks to
efforts made by both sides.
</P>
<P>
Sino-U.S. relations will continue to improve and develop, as
long as the U.S. side honors the three Sino-U.S. joint communiques,
its relevant commitments, and carefully handles bilateral
relations, especially the Taiwan issue, he said.
</P>
<P>
Sun expressed the hope that the Danish government will take
concrete actions to honor its repeatedly advocated position that
Tibet is part of the Chinese territory, and not to allow the Dalai
Lama to go to Denmark for any activities, and to cancel a meeting
between the Danish prime minister and the Dalai Lama, thus
promoting the smooth development of Sino-Danish relations on a
healthy track.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese side does not like to see any damage to bilateral
relations because of the Dalai Lama issue, and also has made clear
its position to the Danish side, Sun said, adding China hopes that
Denmark will deal with the matter in a prudent and proper manner.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that this is in the fundamental interests of the
two countries and peoples," he said.

<HEADLINE> Separatist Remarks Illogical, Illegal: Taiwan Issue Expert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 20 (Xinhua) -- No matter who is elected leader
of Taiwan, Taiwan is undeniably a part of China, Professor Huang
Jiashu of the People's University said today.
</P>
<P>
Annette Lu's remarks on "Taiwan independence" ignored this
basic fact, and are illogical and illegal, he told Xinhua in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
The professor pointed out that Annette Lu's claim that the
cross-straits relationship is one of "distant relatives and close
neighbors" is absurd.
</P>
<P>
"Lu just wants to let the world know that at the moment the
Kuomintang stepped down from power, Taiwan and the mainland no
longer had any relations, and so Taiwan can have independence,"
said Huang, adding that Lu's sole intention is to separate Taiwan
from the mainland.
</P>
<P>
Huang stressed that the struggle of any political party is an
internal affair of a country and should not affect the nation's
sovereignty and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
The People's Republic of China, since it was founded in 1949,
has replaced the Republic of China to become the sole legitimate
representative of China, and exercise full sovereignty over China,
including that over Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
It is a common thing that parties rule in turn in Western
countries, but this has nothing to do with a country's sovereignty,
not to speak of the recent election in Taiwan that only concerns a
change in the regional leader, the professor said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government's one-China stance has been acknowledged
and supported by the international community. Annette Lu's aim to
separate China's sovereignty and territory, using the party shift
as a cover, is doomed to fail, said Huang.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Military to Speed Up Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 20 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian Military (TNI)
pledges that it will speed-up its internal reforms process in line
with the on-going national reforms agenda and will leave soon its
political role, a senior military officer said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The TNI will continue its internal reforms process and fasten
such a process," TNI Chief Adm. Widodo A.S. told a press
conference after presiding over a two-days TNI leadership meeting
at its headquarters.
</P>
<P>
"We also committed to leave our political role. The TNI will
not involve again in political constellation and will then focus
on its tasks in defence sectors," the Admiral added.
</P>
<P>
Widodo said that the TNI's internal reforms was among issues
which has been seriously discussed during the two-days leadership
meeting.
</P>
<P>
"The TNI has experienced significant changes," Widodo said.
</P>
<P>
The TNI has been under fire as its alleged involvement in
atrocities policy in the breakaway province of East Timor since
the territory overwhelmingly voted in favor of independence in a U.
N.-sponsored direct ballot in August 1999.
</P>
<P>
Widodo also reiterated the TNI's commitment to continue its
participation in international tasks to secure the world peace in
line with the country's foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
"During the meeting, we also committed to strengthen our stance
in holding up the supremacy of law. It is clear that the TNI backs
the supremacy of law," Widodo added.
</P>
<P>
But Widodo also admitted that in its bid to develop its
abilities as well as enhancing its defence system, the TNI faces
problems due to lack of fund.
</P>
<P>
The government previously proposed a defense budget of 10.1
trillion rupiah (1.442 billion U.S. dollars) for the current April-
December fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
But the House of Representatives then only approved 8.235
trillion rupiah (1.176 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
"Therefore in this context, we (TNI) will not make a
significant additional force," he said.
</P>
<P>
The number of the TNI personnel now is about 250,000 personnel.

<HEADLINE> Singapore's Trade Continues to Expand in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's external trade
continued to expand in March 2000 with the total volume growing by
23.8 percent to hit 38.60 billion Singapore dollars (about 22.73
billion U.S. dollars), according to a monthly bulletin released
Thursday by Singapore Trade Development Board.
</P>
<P>
Compared to the same month last year, non-oil domestic exports
(NODX) rose by 14.5 percent to reach 9.76 billion Singapore
dollars (about 5.75 billion U.S. dollars), non-oil re-export
increased by a strong 28 percent to 8.42 billion Singapore dollars
(about 4.95 billion U.S. dollars), non-oil imports registered a
growth of 20 percent with a volume of 16.99 billion Singapore
dollars (about 10.01 billion U.S. dollars) and oil domestic
exports expanded by 53.4 percent as a result of the surge in oil
price.
</P>
<P>
During the month, domestic exports of electronics increased by
9.8 percent spurned by strong exports of integrated circuits and
telecommunication equipment, and that of the non-electronic
products rose by 24.2 percent which was largely contributed by the
strong demand for electrical circuit apparatus and petrochemicals
to the region, as well as disc media products (packaged software)
to Japan.
</P>
<P>
Non-oil domestic exports to the United States, Malaysia, Japan
and Hong Kong registered positive growth in March 2000 while that
to the EU market continued to decline by 9.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Of the top NODX exports markets, NODX to Hong Kong recorded an
upsurge of 44.9 percent while figures to Malaysia, Japan and the U.
S. picked up by 29 percent, 33.6 percent and 4.5 percent
respectively.
</P>
<P>
NODX to the emerging markets saw a 23 percent expansion in
March 2000 which was bolstered by strong demand from India and
Latin America.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Voted Best by Tourists From 3 European  Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Swedish, Norwegian and Russian
tourists and travel agents have voted Thailand as the most popular
tourist destination in the world this year, according to a press
release of Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT) and a report of
Thailand News Agency (TNA) on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Swedish travel agents have named Thailand the "Best Tourist
Country in the World" for the fourth year running, the TAT press
release said.
</P>
<P>
An impressive 34 percent of the travel agents surveyed for the
Travel News Grand Travel Award 2000 voted for Thailand. In the
1999 survey, Thailand was the choice of 28 percent and in 1998 the
choice of 23 percent.
</P>
<P>
Norwegian travel agents in January also voted Thailand as the
world's best tourist destination for the second consecutive year
in a similar survey commissioned by Travel News Norway, the
release said.
</P>
<P>
The four Nordic countries, namely Sweden, Denmark, Norway and
Finland, are Thailand's third largest market in Europe. Tourist
arrivals in 1999 from these countries totaled 345,437, an increase
of 19.71 percent over 1998.
</P>
<P>
A report of TNA said Thailand was also rated in a survey the
most popular destination among Russian tourists in the past one
and a half years. The survey was conducted by the Russian
Travelling Agents' Association, with 156 owners of travel agency
being interviewed.

<HEADLINE> SADC Trade Protocol Ready for Signing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 20 (Xinhua) -- The long-awaited signing of the
Southern African Development Community (SADC) trade protocol is
expected to take place in September this year following a
successful meeting in South Africa recently.
</P>
<P>
The Times of Zambia newspaper Thursday quoted Norman Chibamba,
Zambian Commerce, Trade and Industry Deputy Minister, as saying in
an interview in Lusaka on Wednesday that the negotiations were
almost concluded.
</P>
<P>
The signing of the protocol would be done during the heads of
state summit scheduled for September in Namibia, Chibamba said.
</P>
<P>
He explained that before the summit there would be one more
ministerial meeting to work on final touches. Most differences
which caused the delay have been ironed out, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the Zambian government was aware of the anxiety of the
business community to see the signing which would allow them to
penetrate regional markets.
</P>
<P>
Once the agreement comes into effect, it would create a great
relief to many business houses in Zambia which have been looking
forward to the SADC protocol, he said.
</P>
<P>
The SACD protocol, Chibamba said, would foster economic
cooperation among member states and remove obstacles to the free
movement of services and capital within SADC, he said.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Calls for Conflict Resolution in Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Zambia has called on the Common
Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), the Southern
African Development Community (SADC) and the Organization of
African Unity (OAU) to resolve regional conflicts in the Great
Lakes region and in Angola.
</P>
<P>
The Zambia Daily Mail newspaper Thursday quoted Glyne Michelo,
Export Board of Zambia (EBZ) marketing officer, as saying that
these are Zambia's main potential markets, without which a Free
Trade Area (FTA) will not make much sense.
</P>
<P>
The Great Lakes states and Angola are some of Zambia's major
markets for cement, wheat flour, footwear, lime, coal and sugar,
with potential even for food items, Michelo said at the just ended
Cross Border Initiative workshop held in Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
He said that internal and regional civil strife has been the
impeding factor to full exploitation of this potential.
</P>
<P>
The official called for quick resolution of the issues for
COMESA FTA to have immediate benefits for Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to EBZ, a senior official of the COMESA Secretariat
said in an interview that progress has already been made in the
co-ordination between COMESA and other Treaties to cooperate in
the promotion of peace, security and stability.
</P>
<P>
The official, who declined to be named, stated that at a
meeting last month, the regional leaders noted that the prevalence
of conflicts in the region is a hindrance to the regional economic
integration.
</P>
<P>
They agreed on the need for all the member states to strive for
peace, security and stability in the region as provided under
article 163 of the COMESA treaty, he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that member states will continue to meet to seek
peaceful solutions to these conflicts within the framework of the
OAU and in accordance with the United Nations Security Council
resolutions.

<HEADLINE> Ugandans Use Over 60 Million Condoms Annually </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Over 60 million condoms are used
in Uganda annually and female condom use has picked up to about
one million, the New Vision daily reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The number is expected to rise further following massive
awareness on the sexually transmitted disease preventive programs
in the country, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The secret of Uganda, a country with a population of 22
million, in fighting against AIDS is an open policy to sensitize
the public, especially the youth, on the use of contraceptives,
said John Rwomushana, head of the health and research unit at the
Uganda AIDS Commission.
</P>
<P>
The first case of AIDS was reported in Uganda in 1982. AIDS
prevalence rate was as high as over 30 percent in late 1980s and
early 1990s. Nearly two million Ugandans have been confirmed dead
as a result of the HIV/AIDS scourge ever since.
</P>
<P>
However, the national HIV/AIDS prevalence rate has dropped to
10 percent due to the government's increasing efforts against the
disease and great enhancement of the people's awareness in this
regard.
</P>
<P>
Uganda is the only African country where AIDS prevalence rate
is dropping. It aims to reduce the current infection rate from 10
percent to 7. 5 percent by the year 2005.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, April 20 (Xinhua) -- The Angolan government is seeking
for urgent explanations from the Portuguese authorities about the
reasons behind the killing of five Angolan nationals in Lisbon's
"Luanda" disco gas attack, official news agency Angop reported
here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
This position came from the session of the cabinet council's
standing commission, chaired by Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos
Santos, the report said.
</P>
<P>
"The government expects that the moral and material minders of
this crime are civil and criminally held responsible," reads a
communique distributed by the standing commission.
</P>
<P>
In the communique, the government expressed "worry about the
climate of insecurity and hostility" that might arise within the
Angolan community living in Portugal, resulting from the
"inappropriate" statements uttered by some political circles and
certain media.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan government appeals to the Portuguese authorities to
take measures to guarantee the security of the Angolan citizens.
</P>
<P>
In a message of solidarity, the government expressed its most
"heartfelt condolences" to the mourning families.
</P>
<P>
Five Angolans, one spaniard and one Portuguese citizen were
killed at dawn last Sunday, when unidentified elements dropped two
toxic gas containers inside the "Luanda" disco in downtown Lisbon.

PYONGYANG, April 20 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) on Wednesday expressed support for
Russia's ratification of the 1993 Russian-U.S. Strategic Arms
Reduction Treaty-2 (START-II).
</P>
<P>
A foreign ministry spokesman told the press Thursday that the

On April 14, Russia's State Duma, lower house of parliament,
ratified the treaty, under which, the U.S. and Russia each would

2007. The U.S. Senate approved the treaty in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman criticized the United States' move to create a
national missile defense system and intention to withdraw from the
1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty, asking Washington to
completely withdraw and destroy nuclear weapons deployed in South
Korea and "not to initiate a new arms race."

<HEADLINE> Russian GDP Grows 8 Percent in First Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Russia's gross domestic product (
GDP) grew about 8 percent in the first quarter of this year,
Russian President-elect Vladimir Putin announced at a cabinet
meeting Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In March, the growth was a little slower but surpassed 6
percent, and "for the first time in modern history, inflation
amounted to 0.6 percent," he said.
</P>
<P>
"This is not just steady, but also enormous growth," Putin said.
"It gives reasons to some experts to believe that the Russian
economy may be called robust," he added.
</P>
<P>
"Today we have better indicators than those predicted for 2001,
" Putin said, quoting forecasts as saying that in 2001 the GDP
will increase by 4-4.5 percent to 6-6.9 trillion rubles (209.89-
241.3 billion U.S. dollars) and inflation will fall to 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
"We will have to raise salaries and pensions not at the same
rates, but at higher ones," Putin said.
</P>
<P>
Putin stressed the importance of the debate on economic
development scenarios for next year and until 2003 under the
present circumstances. "After the presidential elections and ahead
of the coming formation of the government, significant interest
will be shown in this," he said.
</P>
<P>
"During today's discussion we should proceed from the
understanding that it is tentative and changes may be made related
to the development of Russia's long-term economic strategy," Putin
told his ministers.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Airlines Report Mixed Financial Results </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Major U.S. airlines Wednesday
reported mixed financial results for the first quarter, with some
operators overcoming higher fuel prices and beating estimates,
while labor troubles and other factors hurting others, according
to reports from various airlines.
</P>
<P>
"The common thread is very strong revenues toward the end of
March," Brian Harris, airline analyst at Salomon Smith Barney,
said.
</P>
<P>
Among the airlines beating analysts' estimates were UAL Corp.,
parent of the United Airlines; the world's largest airline, AMR.
Corp., parent of No. 2 U.S. carrier American Airlines; No. 8 Trans
World Airlines Inc. and No. 9 America West Holdings Corp.
</P>
<P>
No. 6 US Airways Group Inc., which narrowly averted a shutdown
by reaching a contract agreement with its flight attendants and No.
10 Alaska Air Group Inc. came in below estimates.
</P>
<P>
"We simply could not overcome the drastic increase in fuel
prices," John Kelly, Alaska Air chairman and chief executive, said
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Fuel prices had surged earlier in the quarter to their highest
levels since the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
The owner of the United Airlines, the nation's largest carrier,
reported an unexpected gain in first-quarter income and raised its
earnings guidance for the remainder of the year.
</P>
<P>
United's parent UAL Corp. earned 191 million U.S. dollars, or 1.
61 dollars a share, excluding two one-time charges. Analysts
surveyed by earnings tracker First Call had expected earnings to
fall to 1.37 dollars a share in the period from the 187 million
dollars, or 1.54 dollars a diluted share, which it earned from
operations in the year-earlier period.
</P>
<P>
Revenue rose nine percent to 4.5 billion dollars from 4.2
billion dollars a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
Fuel costs increased 36.5 percent to 539 million dollars, but
that was less severe than at many other carriers because they were
mitigated by greater use of long-term fuel contracts than some
competitors.
</P>
<P>
The company made up for the fuel hikes by cutting commissions
paid by 12 percent to 249 million dollars, and reducing employee
stock ownership plan compensation expense in half to 91 million
dollars. The airlines have all cut the fees paid to travel agents.
</P>
<P>
AMR Corp., the parent of American Airlines, posted a profit of
89 million dollars, or 57 cents and share, from a loss of two
million dollars, or one cent a share, in the year earlier period.
Analysts polled by First Call forecast it would make 39 cents a
share in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
The world's second largest airline was hit by a pilots walkout
in the first-quarter last year, but AMR posted a profit this
quarter despite a 60-percent surge in fuel cost to 553 million
dollars. Revenue rose 14.2 percent to 4.5 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
"Although fuel costs were up sharply from last year, the
increase was dampened to a large degree by our ongoing fuel
hedging program," said Donald Carty, AMR's chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
Trans World Airlines reported a loss of 63.9 million dollars,
or 98 cents a share, before an accounting change. While that was
wider than the 62 cents a share loss it reported a year earlier,
it was below the First Call forecast of 1.37 dollars a share loss.
</P>
<P>
Including the charge for a change in accounting practices in
the most recent quarter and a gain from sale of investment in the
year-earlier quarter, the company reported a net loss of 76.1
million dollars, or 1.16 dollars a share, up from 21.6 million
dollars, or 42 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
The St. Louis-based carrier's revenue rose 5.8 percent to 809.0
million dollars from 764.6 million dollars, due in part to higher
fares. Most major airlines instituted fuel surcharges during the
quarter to deal with the fuel piece hikes.
</P>
<P>
Fuel costs nearly doubled for TWA to 140.4 million dollars from
72.6 million dollars a year ago. Labor costs climbed eight percent
to 25.3 million dollars under a new labor agreement. But
commissions fell by 30 percent, saving 13.4 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
US Airways went to the brink of a shut-down last month before
reaching a contract agreement with its flight attendants. But
preparations for that possible shut-down and the loss of traffic
to other carriers cost the troubled airline, which also was hit
with some of the steepest fuel increases in the industry.
</P>
<P>
The Arlington-Va.-based carrier reported a loss of 108 million
dollars, or 1.72 dollars a diluted share, well above the First
Call forecast of 1.48 dollars a share. A year earlier, the company
posted net income of 46 million dollars, or 56 cents a diluted
share, but seven cents of that came from the sale of its share of
the industry-wide Equant communications network.
</P>
<P>
With the change in accounting practices, US Airways' net loss
came to 211 million dollars, or 3.27 dollars a diluted share.
</P>
<P>
US Airways' average fuel price rose 105 percent to 88.8 cents a
gallon from 43.3 cents a year earlier. That hike, and increased
flights, drove total fuel expenses up 113 percent to 253 million
dollars. While commissions fell 26.5 percent, that saved the
carrier only 30 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Revenue was basically flat for the period, rising 0.9 percent
to 2.1 billion dollars from 2.0 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
US Airways said that with fuel prices starting to decrease and
labor disputes finally settled, the rest of the year should show
improvement.
</P>
<P>
"The unique challenges US Airways faced over the past year are
largely behind us," President and CEO Rakesh Gangwal said.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Unveils New "Pocket PC" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Microsoft Corp., the largest
software maker in the world, Wednesday unveiled a new line of
handheld computers that some market observers say represent a real
threat to the widely-used "Pilot" devices from Palm.
</P>
<P>
Called the "Pocket PC," the new devices are powered by
Microsoft's latest version of its handheld computing platform,
which so far has not been very successful for the software giant,
according to reports from the company.
</P>
<P>
The Pocket PC, which Microsoft executives officially unveiled
in New York City's Grand Central Station and demonstrated for
attendees at the Comdex technology conference taking place here,
has some industry experts expecting the competition to heat up.
</P>
<P>
They are priced between 499-599 U.S. dollars, putting them well
above Palm's price range, which tops off at 449 dollars for its
Palm IIIc, which features a color screen, or Palm VII.
</P>
<P>
With the new devices, which are being manufactured by Compaq,
Hewlett-Packard and Casio Computer, Microsoft is testing the
waters with the third version of its handheld OS, industry
analysts predicted.
</P>
<P>
"It usually takes Microsoft three or four times to do it right,
" said Tim Bajarin, president of technology consulting firm
Creative Strategies Research International.
</P>
<P>
"This time, they really made the interface simpler," Bajarin
added.
</P>
<P>
With the new Pocket PC, Microsoft makes many of the functions
that used to require users to select options from pull-down menus
available with one touch on the screen, similar to the Palm
interface.
</P>
<P>
The new devices also support wireless Internet connections and
contain a miniature version of Microsoft's Internet Explorer Web
browser and Windows Media player for audio and video files
</P>
<P>
But perhaps more importantly, the Pocket PC offers seamless
synchronization of data across a wide range of Windows
applications, which makes it attractive to information technology
managers in many corporations which are increasingly adopting
portable computing devices into their operations, according to
Bajarin.
</P>
<P>
Although Palm, which started to become popular about four years
ago, had never really targeted the corporate market, their "Pilot"
devices became so prevalent that many users began using them at
work as well, he said.
</P>
<P>
That's led to an increased interest by IT managers, who because
most of them already use Microsoft products, may be more likely to
choose the Pocket PC to avoid potential compatibility problems,
Bajarin said.
</P>
<P>
"The ease of exchanging data back and forth is what really
gives Microsoft the IT connection," he said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Speed up Soccer Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Abdurrahman
Wahid declared Wednesday that the government must act firmly in
endorsing soccer development in the country given its lack of
support in the past.
</P>
<P>
"The government must take responsibility for soccer's progress
in the country. There is no need to force PSSI (Indonesian Soccer
Association) do what they do not want to do," the president was
quoted by the Indonesian Observer Thursday as saying.
</P>
<P>
The president was speaking to welcome more than 200 figures
from the world of soccer and PSSI's executive board, who were
paying him a visit in the presidential palace to commemorate the
organization's 70th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on a recent series of relatively poor performances,
the president did not seem bothered. He was instead very
optimistic that the national team will become one of Asia's giants
again as they were in the early seventies.
</P>
<P>
"When many people have expressed doubt over the national team,
I am, on the other hand, convinced that Indonesia will become the
most feared team in Asia," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he urged all parties involved to maintain their
determination and warned them against sitting back and giving up,
especially at this time when sports have become a huge business.
</P>
<P>
The president also said PSSI's decreasing performance was
linked to the development and training program.
</P>
<P>
"The training program is the foundation of soccer development
all over the world. A good development process and financial
management will boost our soccer performance but it can't be done
without the government's attention," he added.
</P>
<P>
Separately, the National Sports Council vice chairman Arie
Sudewo expressed appreciation over PSSI's big step to conduct
doping tests in its soccer league soon.
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad PSSI can learn a valuable lesson to pay more
attention to its players who could be on illegal drugs which can
influence their performance," he said.

<HEADLINE> Doctors Help Couples with Sexual Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, April 20 (Xinhua) -- The Shijiazhuang No. 6
Hospital in the northern China province of Hebei recently opened a
clinic specifically designed to help couples who have problems in
their sexual lives.
</P>
<P>
According to doctors, the clinic will provide psychological
counseling and medical treatment at the same time. The couples
will stay in a cozy room at the clinic, and the pink-colored
curtains will give them a sense of home.
</P>
<P>
With the aid of the couples' detailed medical histories,
doctors will be able to prescribe appropriate treatment plans for
them.
</P>
<P>
Four such clinics have been established nationwide so far.
</P>
<P>
Chinese people in the past were reluctant to talk about their
private lives with others, and unsatisfactory sexual relations
between husband and wife often resulted in anxiety, quarrels, and
even divorce.
</P>
<P>
The divorce rate in China has been rapidly increasing in the
last few years, and now stands at 10 percent of all marriages.
Sexual disharmony is considered to be one of the main reasons for
this rise.

<HEADLINE> China to Set up Photoelectron Valley in Northeast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Plans are underway to establish
a "Photoelectron Valley of China" in the city of Changchun in
northeast China's Jilin Province.
</P>
<P>
The project, under the auspices of the Changchun Institute of
Optics and Fine Mechanics and Physics under the Chinese Academy of
Sciences, and the Changchun Economic Development Zone, will be
crucial for the development of the country's photoelectron
industry and national defense, according to officials.
</P>
<P>
Photoelectrons are expected to be one of the pillar industries
in the 21st century, and the Changchun Photoelectronic Industrial
Park, covering an area of 2.12 million sq.m., will become a
development center, production and trade base, and an information
exchange center for photoelectron products and research.
</P>
<P>
"We welcome the involvement of foreign investment in the
project, so we can become more competitive both at home and in the
global market," said Cao Jianlin, the institute director.
</P>
<P>
The institute has been known as the cradle of photoelectrons
since the founding of New China in 1949, and it has developed into
the most authoritative base in the country for optic materials,
fine mechanics, and practical optics.

<HEADLINE> World Auto Makers to Gather in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 20 (Xinhua) -- More than 800 auto manufacturers
from 22 countries and regions have expressed their willingness to
participate in the sixth Beijing International Auto Industry
Exposition to be held from June 6 to 12.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-three world famous auto-manufacturers such as Mercedes
Benz, BMW, Volkswagen, Audi, General Motors, Ford, Citroen, Toyota,
Honda and Volvo have applied for exhibition, according to a report
in the latest issue of Beijing Review.
</P>
<P>
Apart from more than 300 overseas enterprises, five state-level
delegations from Italy, Germany, the United States, France and the
Republic of Korea will display their latest models and products at
the exposition, so as to earn a bigger market share in China.
</P>
<P>
The exposition has been held biannually in Beijing since 1990
and it has grown into one of the largest special exhibitions held
in China.
</P>
<P>
During the seven-day exposition, other activities, including an
international seminar on the global and Chinese auto industry in
the 21st century, an auto photograph competition, a national
competition of auto designs by youth and children and a national
competition of auto paintings by children, will be staged to add
cultural charm to the industrial exhibition.
</P>
<P>
Chinese enterprises, including Shanghai-GM, Shanghai Volkswagen,
FAW, Guangzhou Hongda, Citreon-Fukang and other complete
automobile manufacturers from Shenyang and Fujian are also to be

<HEADLINE> China's Enterprise Reform Processing (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Low business efficiency exists in Chinese enterprises, but this
problem has been overestimated. In fact, many state-owned
enterprises have high efficiency and competitive power.
</P>
<P>
The report shows that China has got great success in activating
its enterprises in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1999, half of the excessive workers in China's
SOEs had been removed.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, a large number of out-dated production
equipment had been eliminated in textile, coal and steel
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Experts believe that if these policies continue, the excessive
labor force and production capacity will be greatly reduced in the
next two to three years.
</P>
<P>
The successful Debt-Equity Swap activities of the four
financial asset management companies also made great progress in
reducing the debt burdens of big SOEs.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the profit rate of Chinese enterprises
will increase dramatically in the near future, due to the
reduction of debts.
</P>
<P>
Some economist said that this can be a main reason for the
profit bounce back of Chinese enterprises in 1999, except of other
reasons, such as antismuggling and export increase.
</P>
<P>
However, the lack of government financial resources and too
much limits on enterprise merger and purchase have seriously
restricted the economic restructuring.
</P>
<P>
Collectively-owned and private enterprises, which have made
great contribution to Chinese economic growth in the 1990s, have
not got enough attention from the government.
</P>
<P>
The OECD suggests that SOEs should be limited within a
reasonable range. Economists worry that immoderate expansion of
SOEs will become a long-term burden of public finance.

<HEADLINE> China's Enterprise Reform Processing (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 20 (Xinhua) -- China's enterprise reform is
steadily processing although most enterprises are still facing
poor financial situation and low economic efficiency, according to
the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
</P>
<P>
With the assistance of the State Council and the National
Bureau of Statistics, the OECD has made a series of investigations
and researches in recent months on China's enterprise reform.
</P>
<P>
A comprehensive report about raising Chinese enterprises'
efficiency is expected to be published within the OECD's member
countries soon.
</P>
<P>
At a seminar on the research, senior officials with the OECD
revealed some main points of views of the report.
</P>
<P>
Since 1980, most state-owned and collectively-owned enterprises
are losing money or making little profit. Compared to most other
member countries, China's enterprises have higher rate of debts.
</P>
<P>
Chinese enterprises have been forced to hire excessive workers
and they are also charged with many social security expenses,
which are usually shared by government and workers in other
countries.
</P>
<P>
The excessively high taxation towards state-owned enterprises (
SOEs) is another important reason of their low profit.
</P>
<P>
Enterprise's overcapacity and overstocking of products caused
by early 1990s' immoderate investment have seriously reduced
their product price and further production.
</P>
<P>
Besides these administration burdens, the outdated production
equipment, backward technology and poor management have all ended
with low quality of the products.

<HEADLINE> Germany Assisting China in Environmental Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Germany will focus its aid to
China this year on environmental protection in the process of
developing the country's vast western region, city development,
and resources management, according to the German Embassy.
</P>
<P>
Klaus Wild, a minister with the embassy, said this year is very
important in Germany-China cooperation in the area of
environmental protection as many projects will be carried out, and
Germany will provide technical and financial support to China
through their long-standing cooperation.
</P>
<P>
China's central government has made the decision to jump-start
western development as a state strategy in order to accelerate the
economic growth of the region.
</P>
<P>
In addition to promoting environment-friendly production and
the efficient utilization of resources, Wild also expressed great
concern about the protection of water resources in China's Three
Gorges Project, which will be the country's biggest dam on its
largest river, the Yangtze.
</P>
<P>
China is currently the biggest recipient of German
environmental protection aid, and the two nations are setting up
pilot zones in north China to promote environment-friendly
intensive farming.
</P>
<P>
Germany's aim in helping China tackle its environmental
problems lies not only in the establishment of a sound global
environment, which is subject to China's environmental situation,
but is also part of the plan to import agricultural products from
China including vegetables, flowers, spices, and medicinal plants,
according to Wild.
</P>
<P>
Sino-German technical cooperation dates back to 1982, and a
total of one billion Deutsche Marks has been directed to China
since then.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 20 (Xinhua) -- China hopes that the United
States government will come back to the track of dialogue on human
rights issues as soon as possible, said Chinese Foreign Ministry
spokesman Sun Yuxi here today at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. side needs to show some concrete deeds in this
respect," Sun emphasized.
</P>
<P>
Sino-U.S. relations, on the whole, have returned gradually to
the road of recovery and development in the past year, thanks to
efforts made by both sides, Sun pointed out.
</P>
<P>
There exist now opportunities for recovery and further
development of bilateral relations, as well as significant
problems that need to be solved, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
As long as the U.S. side honors the three Sino-U.S. joint
communiques, keeps its relevant commitments to China, and
carefully handles bilateral relations, especially the Taiwan issue,
Sino-U.S. relations will continue to improve and develop, Sun said.

<HEADLINE> China Urges Cancellation of Dalai Lama's Tour to Denmark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 20 (Xinhua) -- China expressed the hope today
that the Danish government will take concrete actions to honor its
repeatedly advocated position that Tibet is part of the Chinese
territory, and not to allow the Dalai Lama to go to Denmark for
any activities, and to cancel a meeting between Danish prime
minister and the Dalai Lama, thus promoting the smooth development
of Sino-Danish relations on a healthy track.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Sun Yuxi made the remarks in
response to a question concerning this matter at a press
conference here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese side does not like to see any damage to bilateral
relations because of the Dalai Lama issue, and also has made clear
its position to the Danish side, Sun said, adding China hopes that
Denmark will deal with the matter in a prudent and proper manner.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that this is in the fundamental interests of the
two countries and peoples," he said.
</P>
<P>
It is known to all that the Dalai Lama is the leader of the so-
called "exiled Tibetan government", a political figure in exile
who has long engaged in activities aiming at splitting the
motherland and undermining national unity under the pretext of
religion, the spokesman pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"We are firmly opposed to the connivance and support of any
foreign government, organization or individual for Dalai's
separatist activities, and are also opposed to any invitation in
any name and form for the Dalai Lama by any official quarters from
any countries or regions, or meeting between them," Sun said.
</P>
<P>
He said that next month will be the 50th anniversary of the
establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Denmark,
and bilateral relations have exhibited good growth momentum, which
is hard-won and something the two sides should cherish.

handicraft export turnover from the 1999 figure of 170 million U.S
dollars to 250 million U.S. dollars in 2000, Vietnam News Agency
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Fine art and handicraft products are among Vietnam's top hard
currency earners, with outlets covering 50 countries and
territories in the world.
</P>
<P>
Each year, Vietnam exports to Japan large quantities of wood
furniture and ceramics, valued at 60 million U.S. dollars and 5
million U.S. dollars respectively.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam earned 66 million U.S. dollars from exports of fine
arts and handicraft articles in the first quarter of this year, a
year-on-year increase of 33 percent.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam has, with its abundant labour force and access to
materials, great potential to develop handicraft production in
flourishing traditional craft villages like Bat Trang (ceramics),
Dong Ky (wood furniture) and Dai Bai (bronze articles).
</P>
<P>
Vietnam hopes to increase handicraft exports from 250 million U.
S.dollars this year to 1 billion U.S. dollars by 2005.
</P>
<P>
To meet increasing demand for handicrafts, the country has
given priorities to develop the handicraft sector and the Ministry
of Trade has completed a handicraft development project which will
submitted to the Government for approval at the end of this month.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's White Farmers, War Veterans Declare Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of Zimbabwe's war veterans
and white farmers met here on Wednesday and pledged to work out a
plan that would result in an amicable solution to the current land
issue, the daily Herald reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
But the former fighters would not withdraw from the farms they
occupied in the meantime, the report said.
</P>
<P>
President Robert Mugabe, who hosted the meeting with
representatives of the war veterans and the farmers, told a press
conference that farmers who had withdrawn from their properties
should now go back as the two sides had agreed not to engage in
violence.
</P>
<P>
The two sides are expected to meet again next week to find a
lasting solution to the problem.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Zimbabwe National Liberation War Veterans'
Association Chenjerai Hunzvi, President of the Commercial Farmers'
Union Tim Henwood and President of the Zimbabwe Tobacco
Association Richard Tate attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The former freedom fighters have occupied about 1,000
white-owned farms since February this year.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe briefed the war veterans on the farmers' concerns about
"what they regarded as the absence of security" on the farms.
</P>
<P>
"The war veterans expressed to me what their own concerns were
and so when we met the two sides, they were able to express to
each other what their concerns were," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the president, "the farmers are talking about the
need for security for them to be able to carry out their normal
duties -- especially taking into account the current season."
</P>
<P>
The war veterans expressed concern that after so many years
they had realized that there was resistance by farmers to
redistribute land for resettlement, resulting in the current land
occupations.
</P>
<P>
"They then tried to see what solution could be found in the
meantime. I was happy that this meeting was held. I was also
happy that it created an understanding," Mugabe said.
</P>
<P>
The president said that police or the army would not be
deployed to the farms as both the farmers and the war veterans had
made a commitment against violence.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the war veterans said that the farmers
should demonstrate their commitment to the land reforms by
stopping their court case against the farm occupations, alleged
military training of farm workers and stockpiling of arms on the
farms.
</P>
<P>
Henwood said he believed a solution would be reached and the
two parties would meet again soon for further discussions aimed at
reaching an amicable solution.
</P>
<P>
On his side, Hunzvi said that "I am very happy that we managed
to meet at last. We have to work to see that we find a solution.
We have agreed that hostilities should cease and that we should
work toward a solution."

<P>
LUSAKA, April 20 (Xinhua) -- The wife and son of an African
diplomat have been arrested by Zambian authorities for illegal
possession and export of 53 pieces of ivory, Zambia Daily Mail
reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Early last week, the two managed to slip a security dragnet
after the Drug Enforcement Commission of Zambia intercepted the
contraband at Lusaka International Airport.
</P>

The two were however not so lucky last Saturday when they were
arrested by Zambia Wildlife Authority (ZWA) as they sneaked back
into the country with different diplomatic passports in the hope
of collecting the seized ivory.
</P>
<P>
The suspects' names have been withheld.
</P>
<P>
ZWA public relations officer Tennyson Msimuko said his office
is consulting Zambian foreign ministry to determine the next
course of action in view of their diplomatic status.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan President Congratulates Rwandan President-elect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
has congratulated Paul Kagame on his being elected president of
Rwanda and reiterated his commitment to extend good cooperation
with the latter.
</P>
<P>
Presidential Press Secretary Hope Kivengere confirmed this in a
 telephone interview with Xinhua Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
"The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has sent a message of
congratulation to Paul Kagame in which our president wishes him
well," Hope said.
</P>
<P>
However, she said the president has still not yet told her
whether he would attend the April 22 swearing-in ceremony of
Kagame.
</P>
<P>
"He would sent a delegation there if he himself cannot attend,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
The Monitor newspaper Thursday quoted media reports in Kigali
as saying that President Museveni promised to work closely with
the Rwandan president- elect toward the restoration of peace in
the Great Lakes region.
</P>
<P>
Kagame is the first Tutsi president of Rwanda since the small
central African country won its independence in 1962.
</P>
<P>
The 43-year-old president-elect, who had spent over 30 years in
Uganda and served as Rwandan vice president and minister of
defense before the presidential election sparked by resignation of
former President Pasteur Bizimungu in March, had special
relationship with Museveni.
</P>
<P>
Museveni and Kagame, close allies in the conflict of the
Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), have experienced strained
relations due to armed clashes of their troops in Kisangani in
northeastern DRC in August, 1999.
</P>
<P>
They have made strenuous efforts toward relation normalization
since the Kisangani incident. However, it is widely believed that
it will take time to mend the fences.
</P>
<P>
Kagame was elected President of Rwanda on Monday.

<HEADLINE> 8,000 Tanzanian Expectant Mothers Die Annually </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 20 (Xinhua) -- About 8,000 Tanzanian women
die each year from causes related to pregnancy and child delivery,
the African newspaper reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
At least 20 expecting mothers die every day and findings about
maternal mortality rates indicate that the problem occurs to a
large number of families, according to Ali Nzige, director of
Preventive Services in the Tanzanian Ministry of Health.
</P>
<P>
Death rates among expectant mothers in Tanzania is at least 100
 times higher than those in Europe and North America, the director
noted.
</P>
<P>
He said the alarming figure is a sad reminder that all must be
done to enable pregnant women to receive attention without undue
frustration in maternal clinics.
</P>
<P>
Many such deaths are preventable as they arose from erroneous
advice at household level, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that frequency of childbirth, poor services in district
and regional hospitals are often to blame, as nurses take time to
recognize an emergency and often do not have sufficient skills to
handle such cases.

<HEADLINE> Earliest Chinese Characters Discovered (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, April 20 (Xinhua) -- After years of arduous effort,
Chinese archeologists have confirmed that the inscriptions on a 4,
800-year-old piece of pottery unearthed in Juxian County in east
China's Shandong Province are the earliest form of Chinese
characters ever found.
</P>
<P>
These hieroglyphs, called Dawenkou Pottery Inscriptions by the
archeologists, predate the inscriptions on bones and tortoise
shells unearthed in the Yin Ruins and the remains of the late
Shang Dynasty (1600-1100 B.C.) in Anyang in central China's Henan
Province, which have long been considered the oldest Chinese
characters.
</P>
<P>
"This pushes back the history of the Chinese script by some 2,
000 years," Wang Shuming, a research fellow with the Shandong
Institute of Relics and Archeology in charge of the excavation,
told Xinhua today.
</P>
<P>
The pottery inscriptions first came to light in the early
1960s when an ancient pottery wine vessel bearing several strange
drawings was discovered by farmers in Juxian, the center of the
ancient Ju culture in southeastern Shandong Province.
</P>
<P>
Tang Lan, a well-known Chinese paleographer, at that time
regarded the drawings as pictographs, though his view was
neglected because there was a lack of supporting evidence.
</P>
<P>
In the 1980s, more than 30 tombs belonging to the late period
of the Neolithic Dawenkou Culture (4500-2500 B.C.) were excavated
in Juxian, where pottery wine vessels with 20 stylized pictures of
some physical objects were unearthed, providing more clues to an
earlier form of Chinese characters.
</P>
<P>
Archeologists and paleographers have since recognized 14 of the
more than 20 drawings as pictographs and deciphered them as seven
characters, including "fan" (ordinary), "nan" (south), and "xiang"
(enjoy).
</P>
<P>
"A script must have regular forms and given pronunciations and
express certain meanings," Wang said. "The pottery hieroglyphs
evidently satisfy this criteria."

<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, April 20 (Xinhua) -- A loan-sharking ring from Hong
Kong was busted by police in Hong Kong and the city of Shenzhen in
south China's Guangdong Province bordering Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The ring had its headquarters in Shenzhen, and made loans to
people and businesses in Hong Kong at usury rates, operating under
the cover of a financial service company.
</P>
<P>
Shenzhen police cooperated closely with their counterparts in
Hong Kong during the investigation, and seized large amounts of
criminal evidence against the ring, including a computer program
of the usury scheme and a database detailing the dealings and
debtors' bank cards.
</P>
<P>
The two police departments jointly launched an operation to
seize the ring's control center in Shenzhen on April 17, leading
to the arrest of 10 suspects including the ring lead, who is known
as Wen.
</P>
<P>
According to the police's investigation, the ring members used
force and the threat of violence to intimidate debtors in Hong
Kong, thus posing a threat to social security.
</P>
<P>
Police in Shenzhen and Hong Kong have arrested a total of 30
ring members. Police in Guangdong have vowed to further strengthen
cooperation with their Hong Kong counterparts in cracking down on
criminals in the two regions.

</P>
<P>
The pottery inscriptions, they said, reflect sacrificial rites
at that time, just as other ancient writings did. For example, the
pictograph "nan" looks like people forming an altar to worship a
young tree, signifying the rite of praying to the god of the land
for good harvests.
</P>
<P>
Similar pottery wine vessels with inscriptions were also
discovered in Anhui and Zhejiang provinces, both in east China, in
the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Jiao Zhiqin, an associate research fellow with the Anyang
Museum, said this was the result of the tribe's migrations, adding
that such migrations are recorded in Chinese histories.
</P>
<P>
"This demonstrates that the writing was used over a large area,
with Juxian at the center," said Jiao at a forum on Ju Culture
held here recently.
</P>
<P>
Yin Junke, a research fellow with the Beijing Academy of Social
Sciences, said the creation of the writing was not sudden, because
this area was one of the cradles of Chinese civilization.
</P>
<P>
Archeologists have also found some similarities between these
pottery inscriptions and those on bones and tortoise shells, in
terms of both form and meaning.
</P>
<P>
They said this indicates that the latter had evolved from the
former.
</P>
<P>
Chinese archaeologists have long held that the inscriptions
found at the Yin Ruins were not the oldest, and there must have
been a previous period of origin and development of the language.
</P>
<P>
The first bones and tortoise shells with character inscriptions
were discovered in 1899 in a village in Henan Province, where the
capital of the Shang Dynasty was located. Since then, more than
160,000 pieces of inscribed bones and tortoise shells with about
10,000 characters have been unearthed, some 1,000 of which have
been deciphered.
</P>
<P>
These inscriptions, like the cuneiform writing of the ancient
Near East and the hieroglyphic writing of ancient Egypt, are one
of the world's oldest scripts. Their descendants, the "han zi" (
modern Chinese characters) are still in use by one-fourth of the
world's population.

<HEADLINE> China's Textile Industry Succeeds in Reducing Losses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 20 (Xinhua) -- China's textile and garment
industry has made progress in cutting losses and reducing the
number of spindles and employees through restructuring over the
past two years.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, the industry had cut down its
production capacity by scraping 9.06 million outmoded spindles and
laying off 1.16 million employees, ending a five-year streak of
operating in the red with a net profit of 800 million yuan in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The industry also reported 43.1 billion U.S. dollars in export
earnings last year, according to the latest issue of Beijing
Review. Chinese textile and garment exports now account for 13
percent of the world's total and 23 percent of the country's
domestic exports.
</P>
<P>
China ranks first in the annual production capacity of cotton
textiles, woolen fabrics and chemical fiber garments, processing
one-fourth of the worldwide fiber output each year.
</P>
<P>
This year, the textile industry will focus on developing the
market in western China.
</P>
<P>
The industry has advantages in labor and material resources and
manufacturing facilities in competition with foreign counterparts,
and it is particularly so after the industry has kept improving
its export product mix for higher added value, and reformed the
management and enterprise operational system over the past few
years.
</P>
<P>
But it lags behind in management and design capability,
drawbacks that will withhold the industry's development after
China's expected entry to the World Trade Organization.

<HEADLINE> Taxes Soar With Improved Customs Management in Ningbo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NINGBO, April 20 (Xinhua) -- The taxes collected by Ningbo
Customs in this coastal city of east China's Zhejiang Province
soared to 2.04 billion yuan during the first quarter this year,
double the 1999 figure on a yearly basis.
</P>
<P>
Insiders say this huge increase indicates that trade in China
is becoming sound once again, and foreign trade particularly has
been sustaining considerable growth.
</P>
<P>
Ningbo is a major port in east China, and nearly 4.8 billion
yuan of customs taxes was collected last year, double the figure
required by the General Administration of Customs.
</P>
<P>
The increase is also due to greater efforts in the fight
against smuggling and in improving administration and customs
services.
</P>
<P>
As much as 2.48 billion U.S. dollars of imports and exports
were declared at Ningbo during the first quarter of the year, more
than a 70 percent rise on a yearly basis.
</P>
<P>
Imports from the U.S. reached 52.33 million U.S. dollars during
the three-month period, a big rise from the 19.63 million U.S.
dollars for the period a year ago, with exports to the U.S. rising
from 49.24 million U.S. dollars in 1999 to 79 million U.S. dollars
this year.
</P>
<P>
Trade volume with Europe and Asia grew up by a big margin
during the three-month period.

<HEADLINE> Some 700 Rare Books Returned to China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Some 700 rare books have been
returned to China after an absence of nearly one hundred years.
</P>
<P>
Well-known Chinese-American octogenarian collector Weng Wan'ge
recently agreed to transfer these books, some of which are the
only existing copies in the world, to an organization in Shanghai,
the Wenhui Daily reported yesterday.
</P>
<P>
Chinese antique dealers regard this group of books as "very
precious," with extremely high artistic and academic value, the
Shanghai-based newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
These books were part of the large collection held by Weng, a
direct descendant of Weng Tonghe who was the mentor of Emperor
Guangxu (1875-1908) of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911).
</P>
<P>
In early 1900's, Weng's family secretly transported most of
their possessions overseas during a period of constant war in
China, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Afterwards, Chinese relics experts said they believed that the
rare books were lost during wartime.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, some of these rare books appeared at an
exhibition organized by the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York
in 1985.
</P>
<P>
After strenuous persuasion by experts from China Guardian
Auction Co., Ltd., Weng agreed to sell the rare books in one batch
to a high-level Chinese museum or library via the auction firm,
the newspaper said.

<HEADLINE> Traditional Chinese Medicine Education Stresses Heritage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Seasoned traditional Chinese
medicine experts are finding more people following in their
footsteps to become qualified doctors, today's People's Daily
reports.
</P>
<P>
Traditional Chinese medicine stresses the accumulation of
knowledge and personal accomplishment, and its educational method
is "one to one," which means one teacher can only teach only one
student at a time.
</P>
<P>
The State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine spends
500,000 yuan every year to promote traditional Chinese medicine
education.
</P>
<P>
About 627 traditional Chinese medicine students have completed
their studies and become qualified doctors in the past decade. In
1990, the Ministry of Personnel, the Ministry of Public Health,
and the State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine
issued a joint decision on traditional Chinese medicine education,
and about 1,021 experts became teachers to 1,562 students the same
year.
</P>
<P>
The paper notes that most traditional Chinese medicine students
have obtained their teachers' expertise, and even made innovations
in some treatment methods.

<HEADLINE> Mandela to Visit Burundi to Press for Early Peace Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Burundi peace facilitator
Nelson Mandela will pay his first official visit to Burundi Friday
in a new bid to find a breakthrough in the long-running peace
process.
</P>
<P>
The former South African president will try to persuade the
Tutsi- dominated army to open up to Hutus to pave the way for a
long expected peace agreement, the spokesman of the facilitation
team Brigadier General Hashim Mbita was quoted as saying by
Thursday's Tanzanian newspaper The Guardian.
</P>
<P>
"The aim of Mandela's visit to Burundi is mainly to have talks
with the army," Mbita said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In his one-day tour of war-ravaged tiny central African state,
Mandela will be accompanied by his aides from the Mwalimu Nyerere
Foundation and Father Matteo Zuppi, the chairman of committee III
on defense and security formed in the ongoing peace talks.
</P>
<P>
This will be the first time for Mandela to visit Burundi since
he took on the mantle of Tanzanian former president Julius Nyerere
as international facilitator to Burundian civil war last November.
</P>
<P>
Mandela has, as a precondition to visit Burundi, asked
Burundian President Pierre Buyoya to release all political
prisoners and dismantle the regroupment camps to free the
civilians staying there.
</P>
<P>
The Burundian army had forced about 300,000 mainly Hutu
civilians from the areas surrounding the capital Bujumbura into
about 60 camps since last September to clear the way for
government operations against the armed Hutu rebels.
</P>
<P>
Burundi promised in January to close some of the camps but had
failed to do so citing security concerns, though reports said that
President Buyoya inspected two of the camps ahead of Mandela's
visit.
</P>
<P>
Since the latest round of peace talks in March in Tanzanian
northern town of Arusha, all the 19 Burundian parties have been
discussing a draft peace agreement produced by Mandela.
</P>
<P>
The two main rebel groups, the Front for Defence of Democracy
or FDD and the National Liberation Front, have agreed to take part
in the future talks, a latest result of Mandela's mediation.
</P>
<P>
Burundi's civil war began after Tutsi soldiers assassinated the
country' s first democratically elected president, Melchior
Ndadaye, an ethnic Hutu in 1993. Since then Hutu rebels have
fought a rural insurgency campaign against the Tutsi-dominated
army and around 200,000 people, most of them civilians, have lost
their lives.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks, which began in Arusha in June 1998, are
currently taking place in four committees, dealing respectively
with the nature of the Burundi conflict, democracy and good
governance, peace and security, economic reconstruction and
return of refugees.

<HEADLINE> Apple Company Reports Profit up 47 Percent in Second Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Apple Computer Inc. Wednesday
reported a 47-percent growth in profit for its fiscal second
quarter, much higher than expected, as its new PowerBook and
PowerMac G4 machines sold strongly.
</P>
<P>
Not including one-time gains from Apple's sale of its holdings
in another company, the Cupertino, the California-based computer
maker reported that its second quarter net income rose by 72
percent to 160 million U.S. dollars from 93 million dollars in the
same period in 1999, according to news release from the company.
</P>
<P>
On a per share basis, its earnings rose 47 percent to 88 cents
from 60 cents. The analyst expectation for Apple's second-quarter
earnings was 81 cents per share, according to First Call.
</P>
<P>
Revenue rose 27 percent to 1.94 billion dollars from 1.53
billion dollars. About 400 million dollars of Apple's second-
quarter revenue came from sales made through its Web site.
</P>
<P>
Including one-time gains, Apple's net income rose to 233
million dollars, or 1.28 dollars per share, from 135 million
dollars, or 84 cents per share, in the same period of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts noted that the popularity of Apple's iMac,
iBook, PowerBook, and PowerMac G4 computers have enabled the
company to have unit growth that is 2.5 times higher than the
industry average.

<HEADLINE> Boeing's Earnings Fall in First Quarter Because of Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Boeing Co. Wednesday reported
that its first-quarter earnings fell 11 percent as a 40-day
engineers' strike slashed commercial jet deliveries and revenues,
but the world's biggest aerospace company still beat reduced Wall
Street estimates.
</P>
<P>
According to news release from the Seattle-based company, net
income for the first quarter dropped to 418 million U.S. dollars,
or 48 cents a share, from 469 million dollars, or 50 cents a share,
in the same period a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
Analysts polled by First Call/Thomson Financial had estimated
profits at 35 cents a share, down from a consensus forecast of 56
cents before the Society of Professional Engineering Employees in
Aerospace began a strike on February 8.
</P>
<P>
Analysts, however, hailed the first-quarter report as a sign
that the world's largest aircraft maker would likely recover
quickly from the loss caused by the strike.
</P>
<P>
"Two years ago this type of strike would have put the
organization into mass chaos," said analyst Bill Fiala at Edward D.
Jones. "This indicates that management has gotten its act together
on the operations side for the first time in a long time," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Boeing said revenues fell 31 percent to 9.9 billion dollars
from 14.4 billion dollars a year earlier and would have totaled
about 12.5 billion dollars if not for the strike, which trimmed
first-quarter commercial jet deliveries to 75 from its pre-strike
target of 125. Boeing delivered 148 jets in the year-ago quarter.
</P>
<P>
With its engineers back at work, Boeing is striving to get back
on track and meet its 2000 target of 490 commercial jet deliveries,
including a target of 175 to 180 deliveries in the second quarter.
In the first 18 days of April, Boeing delivered 27 airplanes.
</P>
<P>
"Our first priority is getting our customers what they need. We
will be essentially back to our original planned delivery schedule
by the end of the second quarter," said Chairman Phil Condit, who
believes his company can only expect modest revenue growth over
the next three years but plans to continue to boost profitability.
</P>
<P>
Faced with a cyclical market slowdown after delivering a record
620 jets in 1999, Boeing has sought to wring more profits out of
its revenue base, partly through productivity improvements and job
cuts.

<HEADLINE> NBA Regular Season Ends on Wednesday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 20 (Xinhua) -- On the last busy day of the
1999-2000 regular season, the Spurs, Hornets and Pistons all
improved their playoff positions with Charles Barkley saying
farewell to the NBA on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Despite Tim Duncan sat out with a knee injury, the Spurs
rallied from a 17-point deficit in the fourth quarter to beat the
league-leading Los Angeles Lakers 103-98 in overtime.
</P>
<P>
The Spurs took three of four this season, the only team to win
the season series from the Lakers who lost to the Spurs in the
Western Conference semifinals last season.
</P>
<P>
In Charlotte, the Hornets clinched fourth place in the East
with an 83-73 victory over the Miami Heat, their seventh straight
win.
</P>
<P>
Eddie Jones and Anthony Mason scored 14 points apiece for the
Hornets (49-33).
</P>
<P>
At Detroit, the Pistons manipulated the Chicago Bulls for a 112-
91 victory as Jerry Stackhouse scored 21 points, avoiding the
conference-leading Indiana Pacers in the first round.
</P>
<P>
In Houston, Barkley returned to the NBA for six minutes before
he walked off into retirement. He scored two points on 1-of-3
shooting, collecting one rebound and one assist as his Rockets
fell 96-92 to the Vancouver Grizzlies.
</P>
<P>
In Milwaukee, the Bucks led the whole way but Detroit's win
made their 110-105 victory over the Washington Wizards meaningless.
Milwaukee will face top-seeded Indiana in the opening round for
the second straight season.
</P>
<P>
At Minnesota, Steve Nash had 22 points, 10 assists and eight
rebounds as the Dallas Mavericks reached 40 wins for the first
time in a decade with a 113-107 victory over the playoff-bound
Timberwolves.
</P>
<P>
In Portland, Nick Van Exel's 21-footer with 1.7 seconds left
gave the Denver Nuggets a 96-95 victory over the Trail Blazers.
</P>
<P>
At Indiana, Jalen Rose scored 19 points to lead eight players
in double figures as the Eastern Conference-best Pacers posted a
111-92 victory over the Atlanta Hawks.
</P>
<P>
In Orlando, Ron Mercer scored 27 points as the Magic beat the
playoff-bound Toronto Raptors 106-100.
</P>
<P>
In Boston, the Celtics handed the third-seeded New York Knicks
a 112-85 defeat.
</P>
<P>
In Seattle, the SuperSonics squandered an eight-point lead in
the second half and lost 114-106 to the Los Angeles Clippers.
</P>
<P>
At New Jersey, the Cleveland Cavaliers scored a 111-108 victory,
delivering the Nets their 11th straight defeat.

<HEADLINE> China to Use Nuclear Power in Central Heating System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, April 20 (Xinhua) -- China is planning to provide
heating service using nuclear power in the city of Shenyang in
northeast China's Liaoning Province. And if successful, the major
industrial base will probably become the first city in the world
to apply nuclear in such a field.
</P>
<P>
The project, which has just been approved by the State
Planning Development Commission, will need 1.4 billion yuan (about
168 million U.S. dollars) for the construction of two low-
temperature nuclear reactors. Major funding will come from the
local sources.
</P>
<P>
When the project is completed, over 10 million sq.m. area, or
one-seventh of the city's total heating area, will be provided
with central heating.
</P>
<P>
Qinghua University is the developer of the new reactor, which
is based entirely on Chinese technology.
</P>
<P>
"It astonishes me," "Too dangerous, better not start first in
our city," "Why not have a try? it brings warmth without pollution,
" were some of the reactions of the local people.
</P>
<P>
Ma Xuquan of the Institute of Nuclear Research at the Qinghua
University said the chances of an accident at such a nuclear
reactor will be nil, as it can automatically slow down the
reaction speed when the accumulated heat reaches a set security
limit.
</P>
<P>
Besides the proposed Shenyang project, China is building its
first high-temperature gas-cooled reactor in the suburbs of
Beijing, with an investment of 250 million yuan (about 30 million
US dollars), to provide electricity to the city. This reactor was
also developed by Qinghua University. Several cities including
Shanghai have made plans to install similar facilities.
</P>
<P>
Freezing temperatures, 11.5 degrees Celsius below zero on
average in winter, makes the heating period in Shenyang well over
four months long, and thus coal burning has been the main cause of
air pollution.
</P>
<P>
Currently, coal accounts for 75 percent of China's energy
consumption, creating serious environmental problems nationwide.
</P>
<P>
Nuclear power is economical, efficient, and eco-friendly, and a
good solution to the problem, said an official from China National
Nuclear Corp.
</P>
<P>
The government announced this month that China will focus on
developing advanced, safe, and economical nuclear reactors with
its own intellectual property rights rather than merely relying on
foreign technologies.
</P>
<P>
China has built nuclear power plants in Zhejiang, Guangdong,
and Jiangsu provinces, but the main technologies were imported
from foreign countries, including France and Russia. One of the
consequences is that nuclear technology can not be widely applied.
</P>
<P>
China's nuclear industry took shape in the 1950s, and the
country set off its first nuclear bomb in 1964. Since the early
1980s, the sector has been accelerating its efforts to shift from
military production to civilian application, and this sector is
rapidly becoming a major powerhouse in the national economy.

<HEADLINE> HSBC Branch in Xiamen Relocates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, April 20 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking
Corporation Limited (HSBC) relocated Wednesday its Xiamen branch
to the purchase premises in the new business district of this
coastal city in east China's Fujian Province.
</P>
<P>
The bank spent 3.1 million US dollars purchasing office space
of approximately 1,500 square meters.
</P>
<P>
The new branch location will bring greater convenience to
customers to better support HSBC's standard of service, said Eddie
Wang, assistant general manager of HSBC China Business.
</P>
<P>
HSBC has great confidence in the China market, which will
provide both greater business opportunities and even stronger
competition when China enters the WTO, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
In 1983, HSBC was the first overseas bank to open a
representative office in Xiamen, and it was upgraded to a branch
in 1986.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, HSBC has invested more than 80 million US
dollars in acquiring offices in Beijing, Dalian, Guangzhou,
Shanghai, and several other cities in China's mainland.
</P>
<P>
The bank now has nine branches, a sub-branch, and two
representative offices in the mainland.
</P>
<P>
Xiamen now has 12 business outlets and three representative
offices opened by overseas banks, with total assets amounting to
928 million US dollars.

<HEADLINE> Improved Environment for Western China Stressed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Chinese forestry experts have
called for more emphasis on improving the ecology of the country'
s vast western region in the wake of seven consecutive sandstorms
which hit northern China this year.
</P>
<P>
More than 20 experts from the Chinese Academy of Forestry
Science (CAFS), the State Forestry Administration, and the Beijing
Forestry University gathered in Beijing yesterday to discuss how
best to prevent future sandstorms, according to today's People's
Daily.
</P>
<P>
The experts noted that though people can do little about
droughts and strong winds, they should do their utmost to prevent
expanding desertification.
</P>
<P>
At present, China, especially its western region, is suffering
from a deteriorating ecological environment because of excessive
logging, grazing, and other misuses of natural resources.
</P>
<P>
For instance, the forest area of most of western China is
sparse, with the coverage rate for the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous
Region only 0.79 percent, and 0.35 percent for Qinghai Province, 1.
54 percent for Ningxia, 4.33 percent for Gansu and 5.84 percent
for the Tibet Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics also show that over the past few decades
desertification in the country has been deteriorating rather than
improving.
</P>
<P>
Before the 1980s, China's desert land expanded at an average
rate of 1,560 square kilometers a year. This figure rose to 2,100
square kilometers a year in the 1980s, and to 2,460 square
kilometers in 1994.
</P>
<P>
So far, China's deserts have grown to nearly 1.7 million
square kilometers, or about 18 percent of the country's total
landscape, and a majority of these deserts are located in the
western region.

<HEADLINE> Cancer, Respiratory Illness Remain China's Biggest Health Threats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Statistics released by China's
Ministry of Health (MOH) show that cancer and respiratory illness
remain the biggest health threats to the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
About 140 out of every 100,000 Chinese urbanities died of
cancer and some 133 out of every 100,000 rural people died of
respiratory illnesses last year, making these the major causes of
death in the country.
</P>
<P>
Cancer replaced cerebral hemorrhage as the number one killer in
cities in 1997, and men appear to be more susceptible to the
disease than women.
</P>
<P>
Respiratory illness caused fewer deaths last year than in 1998,
but still remained the most serious threat to people in rural
areas. Cancer has surpassed cerebral vascular diseases as the
second most deadly disease in China.
</P>
<P>
Ten major diseases account for more than 91 percent of all
deaths in the country, and these include cerebral hemorrhages,
heart attacks, injuries and poisoning, digestive tract problems,
as well as disorders of the urinary and reproductive systems.
</P>
<P>
More urbanites have problems with endocrine, neurological, and
mental disorders, and rural people still must deal with infant
illnesses and tuberculosis. Health experts explain that rural
people often have little or no access to medical services, and
some infectious diseases are still not under control, posing a
serious health problem.
</P>
<P>
However, many urbanites with better access to medicare are now
facing new problems such as nervous disorders caused by the
pressures of excessive work and competition, they noted.

<HEADLINE> More Tourists Allowed to Visit Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 20 (Xinhua) -- The daily average quota for
mainland tourists to Hong Kong will be increased to 2,000 from 1,
500, bringing total early quota to 730,000, according to Thursday'
s "China Daily" Hong Kong edition.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached in a recent meeting in Beijing
between the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government and
China National Tourism Administration (CNTA).
</P>
<P>
In line with the increase in mainlnd-to-Hong Kong tourism, it
was decided that the number of designated mainland tour operators
will be increased from four to 17.
</P>
<P>
The daily target may be exceeded as necessary during peak
period such as the Lunar New Year, according to the new
arrangement, but the overall yearly quota of 730,000 will be
observed.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Tourist Association (HKTA) welcomed the agreement,
and said it will help increase the income of tourist industry of
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Statistics by the HKTA show that each mainland tourist would
spend 4,370 HK dollars (560 U.S. dollars) on average. Based on the
statistics, the new quota is expected to bring Hong Kong tourist
sector a revenue as much as additional 800 million HK dollars (102
million U.S. dollars) each year.

<HEADLINE> Outbound Thai Tourists Flow Expected to Return to Pre-crisis Level </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 20 (Xinhua) -- The number of outbound Thai
tourists is expected to reach 1.8 million this year, a return to
pre-economic crisis level, the Bangkok Post reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
This would equal the peak outbound tourist flow recorded in
1996, Pradech Phayakvichien, governor of the Tourism Authority of
Thailand (TAT) was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
In January, some 120,000 Thais went overseas, which was close
to the January 1996 record of 129,000, Pradech said.
</P>
<P>
The number of outbound Thai tourists dropped to 1.6 million in
1997 and 1.4 million in 1998. However, signs of economic recovery
pushed the number up to 1.6 million last year.
</P>
<P>
"But spending and the length of stay are decreasing, which
indicates Thais are increasingly cost-conscious when travelling
abroad," said the governor.
</P>
<P>
Currently, average daily spending per head for outbound Thai
tourists is 3,000 baht (80 U.S. dollars), compared with more than
5,000 baht (133 dollars) before the crisis.
</P>
<P>
During the economic boom, the average length of stay for
outbound Thai tourists was nine days but now it has been shortened.
</P>
<P>
In the meanwhile, most Thais were now travelling mainly within
Asia, Pradech said, citing Hong Kong and China's mainland as the
most popular destinations for Thai tourists.
</P>
<P>
Pradech pointed out that travelling abroad would not harm the
country's economy if Thais could gain useful knowledge and not
spending excessively on shopping and gambling.
</P>
<P>
However, The TAT is continuing with its campaign to promote
domestic travel as well, the governor said.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia's Law, Economics Faculty to Expand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's Law and Economics
Faculty is being reorganized, additional courses included and is
to be turned into a full university, according to Cambodia's state
news agency report Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The institution will this year start three more faculties -
management science, banking and finance and commerce and
accounting.
</P>
<P>
The faculty has been offering four-year bachelor programs in
law and economics, in addition to a one-year bachelor course on
business administration for those who have completed the third
year in any faculty.
</P>
<P>
This year, the faculty also plans to introduce post graduate
courses in economic management leading to masters degree for those
with bachelor's degrees in economics, law and engineering.
</P>
<P>
The faculty, founded in 1948 at the initiative of then Prince
Norodom Sihanouk, now has an enrollment of 2,875.
</P>
<P>
Dean Yuok Ngoy said the faculty was preparing to turn itself
into a university due to the increase in the number of students
and faculties.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia now has 9 public institutes and 2 private institutes
that provide training on 62 skills.
</P>
<P>
The royal government of Cambodia attaches great importance to
education, taking it as a key to accelerate the economic growth
and alleviate the poverty.
</P>
<P>
So far, more than one third of Cambodian people are illiterate
and had no access to education at all. Only 20 percent has primary
education and 4 percent has lower secondary education.
</P>
<P>
Considerable efforts have been deployed by the government to

<HEADLINE> Thai Women Untie Their Apron Strings: Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Contrary to the popular myth that
women belong to the kitchen, 70 percent of Thai women are in the
active workforce, although they receive 20 percent less pay than
their male counterparts, the Nation reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted a study conducted by labor academic Worawit
Charoenlert of Chulalongkorn University as saying that the rate of
participation of Thai women in economic production was second only
to Chinese women, 80 percent of whom are in the workforce.
</P>
<P>
"Based on international studies of females in the workforce, we
can say that Thai women are the second hardest-working
contributors to the economic well-being in the world," Worawit
said.
</P>
<P>
The study also indicates the majority of Thai women have to
assume a dual responsibility as the family's second breadwinner as
well as housewife and mother.
</P>
<P>
In the industrial sector, women form the main unskilled
workforce. They are often the victims of occupational hazards that
come with labor-intensive industries, such as respiratory
illnesses from textile production and lead poisoning from
electronics assembly plants.
</P>
<P>
Female workers in Thailand have also been the main driving
force in demanding increased work safety while male workers have
focused on pay raises, the study notes.

<HEADLINE> Donors Commit 1,250 Million U.S. Dollars to Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, April 20 (Xinhua) -- The bilateral and multilateral
donors in the Nepal Development Forum (NDF) meeting which
concluded in Paris Wednesday agreed to extend 1,250 million U.S.
dollars to Nepal during 2000-2001.
</P>
<P>
According to a press release issued by the World Bank at the
end of the meeting, monitored here Thursday, the donor countries
had strictly tied such assistance to Nepal's progress on reforms.
</P>
<P>
"Nepal's development partners reaffirmed their assistance to
Nepal in addressing the challenge of poverty reduction and
economic growth and the level of assistance in 2000-2001 will
range from current level up to 1,250 million U.S. dollars," the
release said.
</P>
<P>
Donors had made a pledge of one billion U.S. dollars in
assistance to Nepal in a similar meeting held four years ago.
</P>
<P>
The donors, however, emphasized that actual levels of
assistance will reflect progress in policy and institutional
reforms and improvements in aid effectiveness, said the release,
adding the levels could even be higher if the pace of reform is
accelerated.
</P>
<P>
According to reports reaching here Thursday, discussions on
poverty alleviation strategy was another important agenda other
than reform during the meeting in Paris.
</P>
<P>
The donors endorsed the Poverty Alleviation Strategy proposed
by the Nepali government and agreed to contribute significantly in
this regard, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The NDF meeting was participated by 23 bilateral and
multilateral donors assisting Nepal's development effort. The
meeting, which was supposed to be held every two years, was held
after four years due to the political instability in Nepal in the
last couple of years.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar FM on World Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, April 20 (Xinhua) -- The world economy continues to be
marked by uncertainty and imbalances as well as the continuing
marginalization of developing countries in this era of globalizing
world, said Myanmar Foreign Minister U Win Aung.
</P>
<P>
In his statement delivered at the just-ended plenary meeting
of the South Summit of the group of 77 (G-77) held in Havana, Cuba,
U Win Aung blamed that the benefits of economic growth and
prosperity to the world economy, derived from globalization, have
not been enjoyed equitably by many developing countries,
especially the least developed among them.
</P>
<P>
He called for adoption of a new approach to international
development cooperation based on growth, stability and equity with
full participation and integration of developing countries into
the globalizing world economy.
</P>
<P>
On financial matters, he emphasized the need to address the
serious deficiencies of the existing international structure
governing finance, trade and development, calling for efforts to
establish more stringent rules and regulations on short-term
capital flows in order to maintain and promote stability in the
international financial system.
</P>
<P>
He warned that there is a tendency on the part of the developed
countries to take decisions that affect the world economy without
giving adequate consideration to the interests of developing
countries and the wind of democratic change that swept across the
world in the political arena have not yet reached the
international institutions, including the United Nations and the
Brettonwoods.
</P>
<P>
He believed that sustained economic growth and development,
particularly of developing countries, must be the main objective
to be pursued as a priority by the international community in
managing the globalizing world economy.
</P>
<P>
Regarding global trade negotiation, U Win Aung stressed the
need to give assistance to the developing and least developed
countries which are already overburdened with the implementation
of the existing World Trade Organization Agreement, taking into
account development dimension while ensuring that these countries
are well prepared to take part in future multilateral negotiations.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed the need that the pace and areas of further
trade liberalization should respond to the priorities of the
developing countries in accordance with the principle of
progressive liberalization of international trading system.
</P>
<P>
He urged the developed countries to fulfill their commitments
to special and differential treatment in favor of developing
countries by opening up their markets and granting duty-free and
quota-free access to the exports to the least developed among them.
</P>
<P>
He warned that the inability to resolve the problems of the
developed countries will deepen the marginalization of these
countries and will further widen the gap between the developed and
the developing countries, urging developed countries to further
reduce tariff barriers for goods from developing countries and
also make a concerted effort to prevent quality standards from
being used unfairly.
</P>
<P>
He called for remaining firm in resisting the renewed attempt
by some countries of the North to link labor standards with
multilateral trade rules, regarding those attempts as a new form
of protectionism with a hidden motive to damage the rare
comparative advantage of the developing countries.
</P>
<P>
On the part of Myanmar, he said, the country particularly
values economic relations with its partners in the South, wanting
to see concrete steps to strengthen cooperation among developing
countries in a wide range of areas such as trade, investment,
technical cooperation, industrialization, energy, food and
agriculture, technology, capacity building and human resources
development.
</P>
<P>
He expressed Myanmar's appreciation over the role played by the
G-77 and China in strengthening international cooperation for
development, reiterating the country's commitment to the
continuing validity and relevance of the objectives and principles
of the G-77 and readiness to cooperate with others.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Hostage Crisis Escalating in Southern Philippines By Pan Jiaxu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 20 (Xinhua) -- The hostage crisis in the southern
Philippines has been escalating after the extremist Abu Sayyaf
group executed two of their 29 hostages Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Abu Sabaya, spokesman of the Muslim rebel group, announced the
execution Wednesday afternoon, saying that they will kill more
hostages every time the Presidential Palace "makes a negative
statement."
</P>
<P>
The Abu Sayyaf abducted more than 50 civilians, mostly teachers
and school children, on March 20 in the village of Tumahubong in
Basilan in a bid to ward off pursuit by government troops
following a raid on an army camp.
</P>
<P>
Some of the hostages have reportedly been freed in exchange for
food and medicine. The remaining 29 hostages are believed to
include 22 children, several teachers and a Chatholic priest.
</P>
<P>
According to the demands uttered by the Abu Sayyaf in their
letters to the government, the three U.S.-held militants include
Ramzi Yousef, the mastermind of the 1993 bombing of the U.S. World
Trade Center in New York.
</P>
<P>
The other two are Sheik Omar Abdel-Rahman, convicted for
conspiracy in a plot to bomb U.S. landmarks, and Abu Haider,
jailed in California and believed to be teacher of the late Abu
Sayyaf founder Abdubakar Janjalani.
</P>
<P>
But reports said the Philippine government has ruled out any
compromise with the Abu Sayyaf, one of the two Muslim groups
fighting for an Islamic state in the southern part of the country.
</P>
<P>
National Security Adviser Alexander Aguirre said the Philippine
government has not asked the United States to release the
terrorists "because certainly that is legally impossible."
</P>
<P>
Aguirre said the government will exhaust all peaceful means,
but he also warned the rebels "to be prepared, because there is
always a limit."
</P>
<P>
The government also said the military forces will launch attack
against the extremist Abu Sayyaf group if the report of two
hostages' death turns true, the ABS-CBN news channel said Thursday
morning.
</P>
<P>
In response to the reported killing of two hostages, Defense
Secretary Orlando Mercado said that if the Abu Sayyaf killed
hostages indeed, the government has no choice but to attack the
rebel group.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the government has been holding back rescue
efforts because this will put the lives of the hostages at risk.
</P>
<P>
"If (the execution) reports are indeed true, the Abu Sayyaf has
just thrown away any leverage it has with the government," Mercado
added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, the Abu Sayyaf even threatened to "kidnap or
kill" Americans in the country if their demand was not met.
</P>
<P>
As a response, the U.S. Embassy here said they will continue to
work and protect their citizens in the country. Meanwhile the
Embassy advised Americans to avoid visiting Basilan, some 880
kilometers south of Manila.
</P>
<P>
There are an estimated 100,000 Americans living in the
Philippines, with an undetermined number of them living in the
southern part of the country.
</P>
<P>
National Police spokesman Nicanor Barolome said police and
military forces have increased visibility to ensure the safety of
people, both locals and foreigners, in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Armed Forces said it had already lined up
several "military options" to rescue the hostages and was prepared
to risk civilian casualties.
</P>
<P>
"We have several military options and these are just waiting to
be activated," said Armed Forces spokesman Rafel Romero. He did
not elaborate on the options.
</P>
<P>
The military is believed to be biding time until the Basilan-
based Crisis Management Committee CMC) exhausts all attempts to
resolve the month-long hostage crisis peacefully.
</P>
<P>
President Joseph Estrada has reportedly asked the CMC to
persuade the Abu Sayyaf to "act within reason and within legal and
moral possibilities."
</P>
<P>
As this developed, the parents and relatives of the hostages
have been staying at the Christian Formation Center in Isabela,
Basilan, waiting for the release of the captives.
</P>
<P>
They said that if the government could not do anything to stop
the execution, they would make their own move.
</P>
<P>
Reports said their move is to go to the Abu Sayyaf's Camp
Abdujarak in Mt. Mahadji and offer themselves in exchange for the
freedom of their loved ones.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 20 (Xinhua) -- The Australian Prime Minister
John Howard threatened Thursday the federal government would
pursue a total ban on Internet gambling.
</P>
<P>
Some states in Australia are to legislate for Internet gambling
in bit to increase tax revenue and refused a 12-month moratorium
proposal from the federal government.
</P>
<P>
"We think there's too much gambling in this country already,
and it's far easier to stop something starting than trying to wind
back something that's been there for years," the prime minister
told Melbourne radio 3AW.
</P>
<P>
"If you have a moratorium, it can't happen during that period
of time and during that moratorium we wanted to investigate the
feasibility of a permanent prohibition on the Internet," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia and the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) signed here Thursday the partial
visa abolition agreement to facilitate the entry of the citizens
of the two sides into their respective countries.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement signed by Malaysian Foreign Ministry
Secretary-General Abdul Kadir and DPRK Ambassador Kim Ja Ryong to
Malaysia on behalf of their respective governments, citizens of
two sides can enter each other's country without visa for no more
than 30 days for the purpose of official duties, business trips,
vacation, sports and attending conference or seminars.
</P>
<P>
Both Abdul Kadir and Kim Ja Ryong said on the occasion that the
agreement marks a milestone in the bilateral relations between
Malaysia and the DPRK.
</P>
<P>
Both sides hoped that with the signing of the agreement,
friendly relations between the two countries, particularly in the
areas of trade and tourism will be further enhanced.

According to an official of the DPRK embassy here, Malaysia is
the third ASEAN country to sign such agreement with the DPRK which
already signed similar agreements with Vietnam and Laos.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Shuttlers Need Outdoor Training </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Ourdoor training is necessary for
Indonesian shuttlers to increase their motivation, build a
competitive spirit among themselves and to have fun, according to
the Badminton Association of Indonesia (PBSI) training director
Christian Hadinata.
</P>
<P>
"Athletes will be motivated to follow all programs. They will
cheer each other and feel they belong to the team. This kind of
program won't only allow them to have fun but it also encourages
them to have a competitive spirit among themselves," Christian
was quoted by the Jakarta Post Thursday as saying.
</P>
<P>
PBSI sent its Thomas and Uber Cups and the Olympic Games teams
for physical tests at the Senayan Madya Stadium on Wednesday under
the supervision of the National Sports Council's sports science
commission.
</P>
<P>
Three of 31 shuttlers -- men's singles Hariyanto Arbi and Budi
Santoso, and mixed doubles Tri Kusheryanto -- failed to show up
for the tests.
</P>
<P>
The tests comprises seven aspects: a 30-meter sprint, 300m
sprint, vertical jump, one-minute sit-up, 4x5-meter shuttle run,
15 minutes of jogging and flexibility (sit and reach).
</P>
<P>
Christian said the test procedure enabled athletes to watch the
process which encouraged them to compete among themselves.
</P>
<P>
"If there's no competition, I'm afraid they won't do the tests
in accordance with their capacity. We won't be able to detect
their real strength," he said.
</P>
<P>
Christian also said that outdoor training should be conducted
more often. "I think we can start by having cross country training
once a week," he added.
</P>
<P>
PBSI physical trainer Tahir Djide expressed optimism that he
would be able to increase their physical fitness in the remaining
three weeks prior to the Thomas and Uber Cups in Kuala Lumpur from
May 11 to 21.
</P>
<P>
"We now have a 40 percent program for physical training and 60
percent for technical aspects and strategy. Starting on Sunday,
the percentage of physical training will decrease to only 20
percent. But I believe they can increase their physical fitness
before the event begins," he added.
</P>
<P>
Tahir said the test showed that the fitness of the men's
shuttlers was better than women's.
</P>
<P>
"Our women shuttlers have an average VO2max (lungs oxygen
capacity) of less than 51 millimeters cubed/kilogram/minute, which
is categorized as average, but we must work hard to increase it.
While the men's shuttlers have less than 65 cubic millimeters/kg/
minute which is good enough," he said.
</P>
<P>
Tahir said the physical test also reflected athletes'
discipline in maintaining their fitness.
</P>
<P>
"As elite players they must be able to maintain their condition
because they are the best and have the biggest responsibility for
the country," he added.

<HEADLINE> Sichuan Sets 10-Year Economic Development Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Sichuan
Province has mapped out a ten-year development plan, aiming to
build the province into an economic strong power in western China
in ten years.
</P>
<P>
Sichuan Governor Zhang Zhongwei said recently that the province
wants its gross domestic products (GDP) to catch up with the
national average level by the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
In ecological construction, Sichuan will work hard to reduce
the amount of sands washed into the Yangtze River by more than 50
percent and increase its vegetation coverage to over 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
In social development, the province will make efforts to
control its annual population growth rate under 0.7 percent and
make rural average per capita income reach the national average by
2010.
</P>
<P>
In ten years, the province will expand its urbanization to 30
percent and will have established a comprehensive social security
system with most urban residents leading a well-off life, he added.
</P>
<P>
To meet the target, Zhang said Sichuan will first accelerate
its infrastructure construction to pave way for future economic
take-off.
</P>
<P>
It will also make further efforts to protect the province's
natural forests and to convert more farmlands to forests and
grassland, he added.
</P>
<P>
Sichuan is playing an important role in the country's strategic
program to develop western China, he said, citing the facts that
its population is 30 percent of the total in the western region
which covers nine provinces and one municipality; Its GDP accounts
for the region's 31 percent while its retail sales taking up 32
percent.
</P>
<P>
Despite its abundant natural resources and market advantage,
the province has yet to make further efforts to cultivate its
development potentials, the governor said.

<HEADLINE> Stegodon Fossils Found in Southwest China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUILIN, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Four fossilized tusk fragments
believed to be the remains of stegodon, or a saber-toothed
elephant, have been found in Pingle County near the scenic city of
Guilin in southwest China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Experts with the Beijing Vertebrate Paleontology and
Palaeoanthropology Institute believe the fossils date back at
least some 15,000 years judging by pictures sent by the fossil
collector Yan Shijie, a local retired teacher. The shape of the
fossilized tusks is clear and intact.
</P>
<P>
Fossils of the ancient species, a large elephant that lived
between 10 million and some 15,000 years ago, have been found in
Africa and Asia, and the most complete fossil remains of the
elephant was discovered in Heshui, Gansu Province in northwest
China in 1973, a specimen 8 meters long and 4 meters high, with a
3.03 meters long tusk.

<HEADLINE> Official Says No Plans to List Chinese Banks Abroad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Chinese central bank official
Xie Ping confirmed today that at present, no information has been
received about any plans for state-owned commercial banks to go
public abroad.
</P>
<P>
Xie, director of the Financial Study Bureau of the People's
Bank of China, also dismissed the possibility that Chinese
commercial banks will be extended into securities or other
financial service industries under the current legal framework,
the China Securities has reported.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted Xie as saying at the Beijing Business
Summit 2000 that positive results have been achieved in the
handling of debts and other bad assets already separated from
banking business.
</P>
<P>
But he still warned that Chinese banks should continue and
further their reforms and prevent new bad loans and assets from
appearing, to prepare for the new situation that will arise after
China enters the WTO.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that Chinese banks take effective measures to
attract senior management talent, particularly Chinese students
abroad, to deal with human resources challenges, and to improve
management and amend relevant laws and regulations.
</P>
<P>
He said the central bank is considering necessary modifications
of current financial laws and standards for evaluating the
performances of the four major state-owned commercial banks.

<HEADLINE> Act of Terrorism Ruled out in Philippine Air Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 20 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government has
ruled out an act of terrorism in Wednesday's air crash that
claimed all the 131 lives on board of the Air Philippines Flight
541, the nation's leading TV channel ABS-ABN said Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
An official of the nation's air transportation authority was
quoted as saying in ABS-CBN's morning news report that it was not
"an act of terrorism."
</P>
<P>
Assistant Secretary Jacinto Ortega of the Philippine Air
Transportation Office (ATO) told a press briefing Wednesday night
that human error may have caused the air tragedy in southern city
of Davao Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
Ortega said their initial findings showed that Flight 541 pilot
Avilusmano Catipay "misapproached" the plane's descent to the
airport.
</P>
<P>
The initial findings run counter to one of the earlier reported
possibilities for the cause of the crash -- sabotage, especially
in the wake of reported threats of terrorists to wage war against
the government by bombing public facilities.
</P>
<P>
Ortega said the plane's blackbox has been recovered and the ATO
hoped that it will reveal the situation during the final minutes
before the crash.
</P>
<P>
The Boeing 737-200 with 124 passengers and 7 crew members on
board crashed at around 7:05 a.m. local time Wednesday in Mount
Camanlangan of Samal Island, some 1,000 kilometers south of Manila.
</P>
<P>
The ill-fated passenger plane left the Philippine capital of
Manila at around 5:20 a.m. and was expected to reach Davao City at
6:45 a.m.
</P>
<P>
As of 6:56 a.m., however, Davao airport officials said
Philippine Airlines Flight 509 had yet to clear Runway 05, the
same landing area which Flight 541 was supposed to take.
</P>
<P>
Assessing the situation, Catipay requested the Davao airport
tower for another landing area and the plane reportedly had to
circle the Davao International Airport.
</P>
<P>
At 7:03 a.m., the Davao tower lost contact with the Air
Philippines Boeing 737. Two helicopters confirmed the crash site
two minutes later or 5.5 kilometers away from the airport runway.
</P>
<P>
As of Thursday morning, rescuers have recovered 83 bodies from
the crash site but no survivors have been found at all.
</P>
<P>
An Air Philippines official earlier claimed the plane was given
its normal maintenance check before taking off and that no
abnormalities were found.
</P>
<P>
Also, the Philippine Atmospheric Geophysical Astronomical
Services Administration (Pagasa) confirmed weather conditions at
the time of the crash were good and that there was no problem with
visibility.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Investigate East Timor Human Rights Abuses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA,April 20 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Attorney General's
Office (AGO) Wednesday set up a team to officially investigate
allegations of human rights abuses in East Timor, in the months
before and after it voted to secede from Indonesia on August 30,
1999.
</P>
<P>
The 64-member investigation team comprises 38 officials from
the AGO, 10 from the Military Police, six officers from the
National Police Force and 10 officials from the Home Ministry.
Deputy Attorney for Special Crimes M.A. Rachman serves as
executive chairman of the team.
</P>
<P>
Another 15-member team of experts was also appointed to consult
and review the work of the investigation.
</P>
<P>
Attorney General Marzuki Darusman underlined the importance of
the work of the team, pointing out that not only would the nation
be watching but also the whole world.
</P>
<P>
"The handling of human rights violations in East Timor is
something new and sets a historical precedence in our law
enforcement. The investigation has the potential to show the
international community that Indonesia has a judicial system and
law enforcement that can uphold the law," he was quoted by the
Jakarta Post Thursday as saying.
</P>
<P>
The team will have three months to report its findings, with
the possibility of further three-month extensions.
</P>
<P>
The findings will become the basis for the AGO to decide to
pursue, or drop, charges against the alleged rights violators.
</P>
<P>
At an August 30 ballot last year organized by the United
Nations, the people of East Timor overwhelmingly rejected
Indonesian rule, setting off a wave of killing and destruction by
pro-Jakarta militias backed by elements of the Indonesian Military
(TNI), which was then headed by General Wiranto.
</P>
<P>
A National Commission of Human Rights inquiry presented a
report to the AGO in February concluding that several top military
officers should be held accountable for the violence including
Wiranto.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian Observer Thursday quoted sources as saying that
the investigation team will summon several military officers on
Monday for questioning on the atrocities. The team will also
question several top officers, including Wiranto.

Howard Thursday criticized the plan to set up heroin injecting
rooms in Melbourne.
</P>
<P>
He told radio 3AW that injecting rooms sent a message to the
community that drug-taking was acceptable.
</P>
<P>
The Victorian state government Wednesday said it would
introduce legislation in state parliament during this session to
establish injecting centers in five municipalities.
</P>
<P>
The New South Wales state and the Australian Capital Territory
have finished legislating process to open heroin injecting rooms.
It was claimed that professionally controlled injecting could
reduce death rate caused by overdose.
</P>
<P>
Howard warned that although such injecting rooms were not
against federal law, Victoria could expect no help from the
Federal Government.
</P>
<P>
"I should make it plain to the Victorian government, as I have
to the New South Wales and ACT governments, that they will get no
help of any kind from the federal government," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I am very strongly of the view that the weakness in the past
has been that all states have not provided enough resources to
help people who want to break the habit and get the medical and
psychological help they need," he criticized, adding that "I think
injecting rooms convey to the community a view that, well, it's
okay; let's not try and rehabilitate, let's just accept."
</P>
<P>
He urged the state Liberals to block the Victorian legislation
in the upper house.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Faces Economic Hardship: Media </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, April 20 (Xinhua) -- "Myanmar as well as some other
nations faced and are facing economic hardship due to outside
interference and instigation," said official newspaper The New
Light of Myanmar Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Although the country is rich in land and water natural
resources, it was far from being developed during the 40 years
after regaining independence in 1948 due to internal strife, the
paper blamed in an article.
</P>
<P>
The most basic political cause of every nation is meeting the
food, clothing and shelter conditions of that nation, it said.
</P>
<P>
The article stressed that all the sovereign countries have the
right to choose the system, policy and form which benefit them,
citing the principles of the United Nations Charter and
international norms and laws which have assured the right of self-
determination.
</P>
<P>
To develop its economy, Myanmar has laid down four economic
objectives -- Development of agriculture as the base and all-round
development of other sectors of the economy as well; proper
evolution of the market-oriented economic system; development of
the economy inviting participation in terms of technical know-how
and investments from sources inside the country and abroad; and
the initiative to shape the national economy must be kept in the
hands of the state and the people.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Defense Minister Confirms on Wiranto's Retirement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Defense Minister
Juwono Sudarsono Wednesday confirmed the retirement of former
Indonesian Military chief General Wiranto as of March 31 this year.
</P>
<P>
"I have seen the decree (on Wiranto's retirement) and it was
signed by the president. But I don't know whether he (Wiranto) has
already received the decree," Juwono was quoted by the Jakarta
Post Thursday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Juwono was responding to a question about Wiranto's status as
the latter claimed earlier this week that he was still an active
general.
</P>
<P>
The decision to retire Wiranto, 53, from military service was
first disclosed by President Abdurrahman Wahid in January this
year. The president then suspended Wiranto from his Cabinet post
as coordinating minister for political affairs and security in
February, pending completion of the investigation into his alleged
involvement in last year's violence in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
The president said in January that three other active military
officers serving in the Cabinet were also going to retire on March
31.
</P>
<P>
They are Minister of Mines and Energy Lt. Gen. Susilo Bambang
Yudhoyono, Minister of Communications Lt. Gen. Agum Gumelar and
State Minister of Administrative Reforms Rear Adm. Freddy Numberi.

<HEADLINE> Romania Initiates Nationwide Tree-planting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bucharest, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Romania has decided to carry
out a nationwide afforestation campaign to improve its ecological
environment.
</P>
<P>
The government's spokesperson, Gabriela Vranceanu-Firea, said
Wednesday in a briefing that the campaign aims to reduce soil
erosion and stop frequent floods and mountain slides. It will also
provide more job opportunities.
</P>
<P>
Solid measures will be carried out by the Ministry of Water,
Forest  and
Environmental Protection to supply suitable saplings for every
local region, she said.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that almost a quarter of the land in
Romania has suffered severe soil erosion and experts consider tree
and grass planting the best way to solve the problem.
</P>
<P>
The spokesperson said the government-appointed advisor Mihai
David will visit the unemployment-striken Jiu valley this weekend
and attend a ceremony to kick off the campaign in Peterila City.
</P>
<P>
Woods occupies 27 percent of the land in Romania. Illegal and
excessive deforestation occurred these years against the backdrop
of national economic reform, causing many environmental problems
in the country.

<HEADLINE> Bosnia Sees Improvement in Financial Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, April 19 (Xinhua) -- The Bosnian Central Bank announced
Wednesday in Sarajevo, capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina, that the
country's financial situation improved last year as the currency
and retail prices remained basically stabled, local media reported.
</P>
<P>
Peter Nicholl, president of the Bosnian Central Bank said the
retail price in the Muslem-Croat Federation remained stable on the
whole with a slight decline from the 1998, and its inflation rate
was negative one percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the retail price in Serbia increased gradually with
its inflation rate standing at 14 percent, Peter said.
</P>
<P>
Last year the Bosnian Cental Bank gained 12 million Bosnian
convertible marks (about 6 million U.S. dollars), doubling that in
1998. The profit of the bank went up to 4 million Bosnian
exchanged marks (two million dollars) from 80,000 Bosnian
convertible marks (40,000 dollars) in 1998.
</P>
<P>
However, the foreign trade of Bosnia was less optimistic. Its
exports amounted to 1.03 billion convertible marks (about 515
million dollars) last year, while its imports valued at 5.18
billion convertible marks (2.59 billion dollars). Bosnia has
incurred a foreign trade deficit of 4.155 billion convertible
marks (2 billion dollars).

<HEADLINE> Reno: Court Rule not Bar Transferring Elian to Father </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 19 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Attorney General Janet
Reno said Wednesday that the Justice Department will abide by an
appeals court rule over the case of Elian Gonzalez, but stressed
that the rule will not prevent the government from transferring
the six-year-old Cuban boy to his father.
</P>
<P>
Reno made the statement in Oklahoma City in response to a
decision earlier in the day by the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals
in Atlanta, which extended an injunction order to keep the boy in
the United States pending an appeal.
</P>
<P>
The court panel decided to bar anyone from attempting to remove
the young Cuban shipwreck survivor from the country.
</P>
<P>
The panel announced that they recognized the government's
authority over immigration matters, but adding that "we fail to
see how an injunction in the case infringes upon the congressional
power."
</P>
<P>
"The 11th Circuit's order, as I say, prevents him from leaving
the country while the appeal is pending. We will abide by that,"
Reno said.
</P>
<P>
However, Reno made it clear that the court rule "does not
preclude me from placing Elian in his father's care while he is in
the United States."
</P>
<P>
The boy's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, arrived in the United
States on April 6 to fight for the custody of his son with his
distant relatives in Miami. The Immigration and Naturalization
Service (INS) ruled that the boy belongs to his father.
</P>
<P>
"We are still reviewing the court's decision, for I have just
had the chance to look at it as I have come off the plane. We are
going to take and consider all our options and take the course of
action that we deem appropriate under the circumstances," Reno
added.
</P>
<P>
Elian was rescued on November 25 last year near a shipwreck
after his mother and 10 others were drowned when their boat
capsized in the sea off Florida and later was sent to his
relatives in Miami.
</P>
<P>
The appeals court order temporarily blocked anyone from taking
Elian out of the country until it decides whether to hear the
asylum claims.
</P>
<P>
Reno said that the appeals court's decision addressed the
asylum issue only, but did not deal with who cares for the child
while he is in the United States.
</P>
<P>
"The immigration laws clearly call for a child to be placed in
the care of a parent, in preference to a more distant relative,
while the child's immigration status is being resolved," she added.

<HEADLINE> China to Join Railways along Yangtze River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, April 20 (Xinhua) -- China is planning to build a 420-
kilometer-long railway to effect the linking of a railway
thoroughfare along the country's longest river of Yangtze.
</P>
<P>
The railway is designed to run through the country's most
rugged areas to connect Yidu City, close to the Three Gorges Dam
in central China's Hubei Province, with southwest China's
Chongqing Municipality.
</P>
<P>
The 11.7 billion yuan (1.4 billion U.S. dollars) project will
make it possible for train to run directly from Shanghai to
Chongqing along the Yangtze.
</P>
<P>
For people living in the western mountains of Hubei Province,
construction of the railway could be no better news. "That is what
we have been aspiring for almost a century," said Guo Daxiao, head
of the Enshi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture.
</P>
<P>
The traffic inconvenience has become a herculean hinder to the
local economic development. All the eight counties under its
jurisdiction are among the poorest counties in China. Currently
about two percent of its 3.8 million people are still poverty-
stricken. Local people have been praying for railway as they do
for rain in drought season.
</P>
<P>
The plan of building the railway in this rough country first
came into being in 1903. A railway company was formed in the
following year with Zhan Tianyou as the general engineer. Zhan had
studied in the United States and was an authentic expert on
railways.
</P>
<P>
The construction work, however, was suspended by war in 1926
with only dozens of kilometers of roadbed and seven kilometers'
rail paved.
</P>
<P>
The re-launching of the project is partly attributed to China's
recent strategy to develop its vast western region. Enshi, the
youngest autonomous prefecture established in 1983, was
fortunately included in the grand development strategy.
</P>
<P>
"Improving infrastructure including a convenient traffic plays
an increasingly important role in absorbing foreign investment,"
Guo said, believing that the railway parallel to the Yangtze River
would bring more business opportunities to Enshi.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, another railway between Chongqing and Huaihua City
of central China's Hunan Province will also be constructed soon.
This railway will pass by Enshi.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 20 (Xinhua) -- China has adopted a strategy of
developing its vast western part, making it a key task in the
national economy this year and in coming years. Following are
major events on the western development this week:
</P>
<P>
 Greater Suppport to Western China's Education
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Communist Party Central Committee and the State
Council has issued a circular calling for further support and aid
to schools in China's western regions.
</P>
<P>
The success or failure of development the western regions
depends, to a large extent, on improving human resources and
qualified personnel.
</P>
<P>
The circular called on schools in relatively well-off regions
in eastern China to provide support and aid to their counterparts
in the west.
</P>
<P>
The circular also urged urban schools in western regions to
offer support and funds in helping schools in rural and poor areas.
</P>
<P>
 Protection of Cultural Relics in Western China
</P>
<P>
Provinces and autonomous regions in western China are making
coordinated effort to protect their cultural relics in the process
of developing western China.
</P>
<P>
The newly founded Shaanxi Provincial Leading Group for
Development of Western China, for example, consists of experts on
local cultural relics who are conducting archaeological
excavations before the construction of roads and railways begins.
</P>
<P>
Western China, the cradle of Chinese civilization, makes up 56.
8 percent of the country's total area. The region is rich in
cultural relics, including terra-cotta warriors and the Mausoleum
of Emperor Qin Shihuang, the first emperor of the Qin Dynasty (221-
206 B.C.) in Shaanxi, the Mogao Grottoes in Gansu, and the Dazu (
Big Foot) Rock Carvings in Sichuan, all of which are cited on the
World Cultural Heritage list.
</P>
<P>
Farmers Looking for Jobs in West China
</P>
<P>
An increasing number of farmers in east China's Jiangxi
Province are moving to the western part of China to make earnings.
</P>
<P>
For a long time, farmers would choose to work in economically-
advantaged coastal areas, but the trend has changed as China has
kicked off a national campaign to develop its western part.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that more than 30,000 Jiangxi people went to
western China in March, and 11,000 farmers were from Xingguo
County alone.

<P>
Some leading Chinese experts called for the establishment of a
fund to accelerate the development of China's western region.
</P>
<P>
Lack of funds has long been a bottleneck for economic
development in the western China.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of a fund should use both the governmental
and regional finance. Other provinces should also provide
financial aid to the best of their ability and solicit the support
and help of international organizations and foreign governments in
raising funds.
</P>
<P>
These funds will also compensate transportation and
environmental costs.
</P>
<P>
Symposium Focuses on Sending Power From West to East China
</P>
<P>
A symposium focusing on the transmission of the rich energy
resources in western China to the economically developed east was
held in Beijing from April 11 to 12.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Guobao, a vice-minister of the State Development Planning
Commission, said developing rich energy resources in the western
regions and transmitting them to the east is an inevitable choice
for China and a win-win strategy for both the western and eastern
regions.
</P>
<P>
China has potential hydropower resources of 378 million
kilowatts in installed capacity. However, 70 percent of the
resources are in the remote western regions.
</P>
<P>
Ensuring Supply of Quality Seedlings to Western China
</P>
<P>
The China State Forestry Administration has issued a circular,
urging localities to take concrete steps to provide farmers with
quality seedlings in the country's drive to turn farmland to
forest in western China.
</P>
<P>
A SFA official said that the supply of seedlings is adequate
on the whole, however, the prices of some varieties have surged
due to strong demand.
</P>
<P>
The circular asks localities in the region to strengthen market
management and firmly stop the illegal raising of seedling prices
while setting a top limit on these prices.

China's Ministry of Education will earmark 70 million yuan this
year to improve the distance-learning system in western territory,
a ministry official said today in Xi'an, the capital of northwest
China's Shaanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a seminar on education development in the west, the
official also noted that his ministry will take steps to stimulate
east-west cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The ministry will expand the national education and research
network, known as CERNET, to cover all higher education
institutions, major vocational schools, middle and primary schools
and schools in ethnic areas in the west.
</P>
<P>
The ministry will complete the construction, development and
upgrading of a college campus network in the west within the next
three years, and will help middle and primary schools to improve
the quality of their distance-learning education programs.
</P>
<P>
Sichuan Sets Key Sectors for Foreign Investment
</P>
<P>
Southwest China's Sichuan Province will further open some key
sectors to encourage foreign investment in a move to stimulate
competition and to assist the development of west China.
</P>
<P>
Sichuan Governor Zhang Zhongwei said the province will open
wider to overseas investment in areas of information technology,
tourism, environment protection, tourism and service in addition
to agriculture development, machinery and electronics, building
materials and decoration industries.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that apart from running joint ventures and solely
foreign-funded enterprises, foreign businessmen can adopt new
approaches for investment such as share-holding, BOT,
incorporating and purchasing, franchises, and issuing bonds abroad.
</P>
<P>
 "Glory Project" to Participate in Western Development
</P>
<P>
The Glory Project, a national anti-poverty project, should be
actively involved in the development of the country's vast west, a
senior official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Wang Zhaoguo, president of the China Glory Project Promotion
Association, noted that the western development has given the
project room to grow.
</P>
<P>
In his address to the first session of the second council of
the association, the official stressed that the project will
benefit this and future generations.
</P>
<P>
Since it was initiated in 1994 by private businesspeople, 3,508
private entrepreneurs have so far joined in the project, funding 3,
829 projects with more than 10 billion yuan of investment.

<HEADLINE> Senior Official on Development of China's Venture Capital Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Market players still need to be
prudent as China's venture capital industry remains at the start-
up stage, Cheng Siwei, vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of
the National People's Congress, said yesterday.
</P>
<P>
Today's China Securities quoted Cheng as saying that China has
already witnessed substantial development of the venture capital
industry over the past few years, even though many problems remain
to be resolved.
</P>
<P>
Cheng said in an address to a venture capital seminar in
Beijing yesterday that China's plan to establish a NASDAQ-like
stock market will give further incentive to the development of
venture capital firms.
</P>
<P>
The country not only needs to promulgate a venture capital law,
but also needs to cultivate experienced venture capital investors,
he noted.
</P>
<P>
Cheng had previously called for a cooling-down period for the
discussion of venture capital, saying that China first need to
study the experiences of other countries carefully, and then
balance this against the reality of Chinese society.
</P>
<P>
He had held that for the present, China lacks the conditions
essential for establishing another stock market because this will
require greater information disclosures, market interaction, and
regulations than now exist.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Zhenghua, vice-chairman of NPC Standing Committee, also
attended the seminar and was quoted as saying that China's bio-
engineering industry has been developing rapidly, but needs
financial support from venture capitalists as well.
</P>
<P>
The seminar was jointly sponsored by the China Venture Capital
Investment Co., Ltd., NASDAQ, and the Hong Kong Polytechnic
University.

<HEADLINE> Australian Fruit Growers Use Pheromone to Kill Injurious Insects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Australian fruit growers kill
injurious insects with pheromone dispensers.
</P>
<P>
According to The Age Thursday, they are putting tiny pheromone
dispensers in their orchards and fields which mimic the scents
that female insects and moths produce to attract males. As a
result, the male becomes completely overwhelmed by many pheromones
flying through the air and finds it impossible to get hold of a
female.
</P>
<P>
"The poor old male runs around looking for a female and every
time he gets on a scent he ends up on a piece of plastic," a
farmer was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The sexual trickery is part of the Integrated Pest Management
strategy developed by the Australian government's Horticultural
Research and Development Corporation. More and more fruit and
vegetable growers no longer have to rely on pesticides and are
reporting greater yields while consumers are getting fruit and
vegetables free of chemical residue.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Govt Armed Group Members Surrender in Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, April 20 (Xinhua) -- A total of 34 members from three
anti-government armed groups in Myanmar surrendered to the
government last month, official newspaper The New Light of Myanmar
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
These members of the Shan-State United Revolutionary Army (SURA)
, All Burma Students' Democratic Front (ABSDF) and Kayin National
Union (KNU) "exchanged arms for peace" at southern, southeast,
eastern, northwestern, coastal and triangle region command areas
respectively between March 1 and 31.
</P>
<P>
They brought along with them a total of 227 rounds of
ammunition, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The SURA is an anti-government Shan ethnic armed group
operating in the northeastern Shan state, while the ABSDF is a
similar students' armed organization operating on the Thai-Myanmar
border and the KNU is the largest anti-government ethnic armed
group operating on the same border for over five decades since the
early days of Myanmar's independence.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, 17 anti-government ethnic armed groups as well as
the Mong Tai Army, led by former drug warlord Khun Sa, have made
peace with the government with cease-fire agreements reached
between them.

<HEADLINE> UNCTAD Official on Brazil's Export Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, April 19 (Xinhua) -- A U.N. official said
Wednesday that Brazil lacks an effective policy to revive its
export trade.
</P>
<P>
Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and
Development (UNCTAD) Rubens Ricupero said that of the hundred
products growing rapidly in the international trade, none is
included in the Brazilian foreign sales list.
</P>
<P>
UNCTAD predicted that Brazil's share in world trade would
remain the same this year when the international trade is expected
to grow 6.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
"Brazilian exports, based on primary products, such as steel,
soybean complex, coffee, paper and cellulose, have been stranded
for 20 years," Ricupero told a local news agency.
</P>
<P>
Until the second week of April, Brazilian exports amounted to a
total of 14.053 billion U.S. dollars, 88 million dollars less than
its imports.

<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Peru will rank seventh largest gold
producer this year, an official from the Mining, Oil and Energy
National Society said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Peru's gold output will amount to 140 tons this year, up ten
tons compared with that of last year, said Guillermo Albareda.
</P>
<P>
The output could sharply grow in a not too long period if the
great potential of many gold projects under construction are taken
into account, he added.
</P>
<P>
This year Peru's mining companies planned to invest over 350
million U.S. dollars to increase gold production.
</P>
<P>
"We are working in long-term investments as hard as we have
worked during the last ten years," said Carlos Galvez, president
of the Gold Committee and Chief Executive Officer of Buenaventura
company.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, the exports of gold earned Peru about 1.2 billion
dollars.

<HEADLINE> Mafiaboy Bailed Out After Charged With Mischief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, April 19 (Xinhua) -- A Montreal boy believed to be "
Mafiaboy" was bailed out Wednesday after charged with two counts
of mischief under the Young Offenders Act of Canada.
</P>
<P>
The 15-year-old youngster, who could not be identified because
of his age, was out on condition that he should not be allowed to
use the Internet or frequent computer stores. He can only use a
computer under supervision for school homework, Canadian police
said.
</P>
<P>
If convicted, the teenage boy could face a maximum sentence of
two years in custody and be fined up to 1,000 Canadian dollars (
about 675 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Early in the day, Police Inspector Yves Roussel told a press
conference in Montreal that "the prosecution intends to
demonstrate before the court that Mafiaboy is responsible for the
denial-of-service attack that was launched for more than four
hours on the 8th of February against the CNN site" and 1,200 CNN-
hosted sites.
</P>
<P>
But he said he didn't believe Mafiaboy was "what we would call
a genius."
</P>
<P>
He said investigators were able to track the suspect in part
because he bragged about his alleged exploit in messages sent to
Internet chat rooms.
</P>
<P>
"This individual, using the nickname Mafiaboy, would have
publicized on many occasions that he was the person responsible
for those attacks," said the officer.
</P>
<P>
What is important is "to let young people know they are not
going to get away with these abuses because of age. More
importantly, we have to renew our efforts to teach children, young
people about cyber-ethics," the police inspector noted.
</P>
<P>
He said the investigation "is still on-going" and "there is an
open possibility that others might be arrested."
</P>
<P>
Between February 7 and 14, hackers launched a series of cyber
attacks against famous Web sites such as Yahoo!, Ebay, CNN, Amazon.
com, Excite and Etrade, causing economic losses of millions of
dollars and triggering security concerns by the Internet industry
and users around the world.

<P>
BRUSSELS, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Some 29,000 Belgium agriculture
companies and farms have filed for damages from the dioxin crisis
which took place in this country last year, according to data from
the Belgian Agriculture Ministry Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The beef sector submitted the largest number with 19,000 claims.
If all reports are in line with the government rules, the total
amount to be paid out in damages will be 6.6 billion Belgian
francs (157 million U.S. dollars), one billion Belgian francs more
than expected. At the same time, the average compensation will be
230,000 Belgian francs (5,476 dollars) per company.
</P>
<P>
From last May, many chickens, eggs, pork as well as beefs and
their products were found to have been contaminated by dioxin-
related chemicals in Belgium, which caused panic over consumers'
health.
</P>
<P>
For several months, European people fear that toxic substances
would enter the food chain to damage human health. Some countries
also took steps to ban Belgium's animal and animal products, which
caused dioxin crisis and business damages.
</P>
<P>
Late last year, the Belgian government announced measures about
the compensation for damages from dioxin crisis. The deadline to
submit files for damages was March this year.

LHASA, April 20 (Xinhua) -- The Tibet Autonomous Region in
southwest China invested 700 million yuan (84 million U.S. dollars)
in highway construction last year.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, Tibet completed the renovation and reconstruction of
several highways, including the renovation project of the Qinghai-
Tibet highway, the Damxung-Lhunzhub-Lhasa highway, and
improvement of the Bamda-Qamdo highway and several sections of the
Sichuan-Tibet highway.
</P>
<P>
Tibet is the only region with no railways among China's 34
provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, and depends
mainly on highways to transport goods into and out of the region.
</P>
<P>
This landlocked part of southwestern China has spent a total of
3.6 billion yuan on road construction in the past five years,
providing highway access to over 80 percent of its townships.

<HEADLINE> China to Develop Business Incubation Centers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 20 (Xinhua) -- China will increase the number
of business incubation companies to more than 200 by the year 2005,
twice the current figure, said Xu Guanhua, vice minister of
Science and Technology, at an international conference on business
incubation and technology innovation which closed yesterday in
Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
China now has 110 business incubators, which have helped the
establishment of 1,785 enterprises and are still working toward
the goal of setting up an additional 5,000 firms, Xu said.
</P>
<P>
Chinese researchers score more than 30,000 scientific and
technological achievements a year, and the country is in great
need of more business incubation centers to make it possible to
transform the growing number of research findings into products.
</P>
<P>
Efforts should be made to change some application-oriented
research institutions into business incubation centers, and to
form business incubation network in major cities across the
country, he said.
</P>
<P>
At present, science and technology parks set up at universities
and others established by returned students and large enterprises
are given top priority to developing business incubators.
</P>
<P>
Business incubation companies offer package services to venture
firms, which include providing production and communications
facilities as well as policy, financial and legal consultations.
</P>
<P>
Such services are important for cutting production costs and
abridging the transformation period from research findings to
products in the midst of a global technology revolution.

<P>
BEIJING, April 20 (Xinhua) -- A relics protection official has
called for prompt steps to curb the accidental damage done to
cultural relics in urban construction, China Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
"The most urgent task for us is to reverse the opinion that we
can simply brush aside the issue of relics protection, and pull
down relics to make way for economic development," said Song
Xinchao, director of the Archaeological Finding Division of the
State Bureau of Cultural Relics.
</P>
<P>
Demolition of relics occurred in urban construction projects,
the majority of which were done out of ignorance of the law and
the significance of relic treasures.
</P>
<P>
The Relics Protection Law, which took effect since 1982,
clearly stated that construction companies are responsible for
protecting relics unearthed in construction areas as well as all
the necessary expenses involved in the protection.
</P>
<P>
"Relics are the common heritage of all Chinese people, and we
want the public to understand that relics protection is the
responsibility of the whole society," Song was quoted as saying.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Reigning champion Manchester
United was knocked out of the Champions League by Real Madrid with
a 3-2 win in a thrilling quarter-final contest at Old Trafford on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Real, held to a 0-0 draw in Madrid in the first leg, took the
lead in the 20th minute when Fernando Morientes played Michel
Salgado into a wide position and his harmless low cross was
diverted into his own net by United skipper Roy Keane.
</P>
<P>
Seven times European champions Madrid stretched their lead with
a quick break from their area in the 50th minute with Steve
McManaman feeding Raul, who ran 40 meters before curling his shot
past United keeper Raimond Van der Gouw.
</P>
<P>
A brilliant turn by captain Fernando Redondo set up a third
when he outwitted three players before laying a low ball across
the goalmouth for Raul to side-foot home three minutes later.
</P>
<P>
David Beckham score the best goal of the game in the 64th
minute when he beat three defenders before firing high into the
net.
</P>
<P>
Paul Scholes scored a late penalty after McManaman tripped
Keane on the edge of the box. But it was not enough to save United
from their first home defeat in 38 matches and a premature exit
from the competition they won in Barcelona last May.

<HEADLINE> Chelsea and Middlesbrough Charged by FA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 19 (Xinhua) -- English premier league soccer
clubs Chelsea and Middlesbrough have been charged by English F.A.
with failing to control their players.
</P>
<P>
The FA charged the two Premiership clubs following separate
incidents in which players are accused of intimidating match
officials.
</P>
<P>
Chelsea, who were fined 50,000 pounds last week after being
found guilty of the same offence, are back in the dock to explain
the actions of their players at the end of Saturday's game at
Sheffield Wednesday. Middlesbrough have been charged over their
players' reaction to Manchester United's fourth goal in Boro's 4-3
defeat, on Monday April 10, when they thought scorer Quinton
Fortune was offside.
</P>
<P>
Television replays later proved the linesman had made the right
decision.
</P>
<P>
The Middlesbrough charge is laced with irony because it was the
behaviour of Manchester United players after a penalty decision at
Old Trafford, during a game with Boro in January, which prompted
the FA clampdown on intimidation of officials.
</P>
<P>
United's stars, led by Roy Keane and Jaap Stam, hounded referee
Andy D'Urso to the touchline after he had awarded the visitors a
penalty.
</P>
<P>
No action was taken against the Old Trafford club or the
players involved but the FA's new chief executive Adam Crozier
pledged to end the ugly sight of Premiership players screaming in
the faces of referees.
</P>
<P>
Lancaster Gate, while aware of controversially charging
Middlesbrough over an incident relating to the return fixture,
studied video tapes of this month's game at the Riverside Stadium
and decided to act in keeping with the new edict.
</P>
<P>
The FA are unlikely to deduct points from the London club as
they chase a Champions League place, made all the more important
after their exit from Europe at the hands of Barcelona.
</P>
<P>
Middlesbrough, as first-time offenders, are looking at a
smaller
fine if the case against them is proved.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 19 (Xinhua) -- The Confederation of African
Football (CAF) has yet to receive any formal bids for the hosting
of the 2004 African Nations' Cup.
</P>
<P>
The deadline is only about one month away but CAF press officer
Viken Djizmedjian said: "We do know about the intention of several
countries to present their bids from what we read on the wires but
there is nothing official yet."
</P>
<P>
CAF's executive committee is due to decide on the host for the
2004 Nations' Cup in July after earlier this year disqualifying a
joint bid from west African countries Togo and Benin and one from
Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Both bids did not carry the necessary government guarantees,
although Egyptian officials said afterwards their failure to
provide the right documentation had just been an oversight and
would be re-submitted.
</P>
<P>
In recent months there have been reports of interest by Libya,
Tunisia, Zambia and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week plans for a joint bid by Congo and the
neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo to host the biennial
tournament was announced by state radio in Brazzaville after a
meeting between the two countries' sports ministers.

<HEADLINE> Algerian President Calls for Enhanced Ties Among African States </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALGIERS, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Algerian President Abdelaziz
Bouteflika here on Thursday called for enhancing the ties among the
African countries to "maximize the capacities of the continent in
the development battle."
</P>
<P>
"The continent is not poor. It has eminent natural and human
resources," he said in his address to the opening ceremony of the
23rd session of African ministers of labour and social affairs.
</P>
<P>
The labour and production force is the only guarantee for
assuming an advanced position among competitors in the
globalization age that is increasingly emerging in various aspects
of international relations, said Bouteflika, also current president
of the Organization of African Unity (OAU).
</P>
<P>
He stressed the important role of the African women in the
development process.
</P>
<P>
On the unemployment problem in Africa, Bouteflika said the
resolution of the problem lies in expanding labor-intensive
investment projects such as free business and traditional
industries that take into account the social privacies of the
vulnerable categories.
</P>
<P>
He called on the African countries to face up to the challenges
and problems to promote the achievements of the last century and
achieve more goals to improve the social conditions and find
practical solutions to the issues on the agenda of the current
session.
</P>
<P>
The deteriorating living conditions and spreading poverty in
Africa result mainly from weak investment and slow economic growth
rate, Bouteflika noted. He also blamed the years of drought that
impoverished vast areas of the black continent for deteriorating
the living conditions and exacerbating the unemployment situation.
</P>
<P>
He urged the African countries to expand the channels of open
and direct dialogue.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Bouteflica called on the international community to
abandon the discriminative view about Africa in terms of human
rights and not to separate the social and economic rights from the
civil and political ones.
</P>
<P>
The two-day session of African ministers of labor and social
affairs attracted representatives of 53 African countries and
delegates of 25 regional and international organizations.

<HEADLINE> Nicaraguan Army Captures Honduran Fishing Boats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, April 20 (Xinhua) -- The Nicaraguan Army captured this
week three small fishing boats that had sailed from Honduras and
El Salvador and were fishing in the Gulf of Fonseca in the Pacific
Ocean.
</P>
<P>
The Nicaraguan Navy said Thursday that the three canoes were
detained when they were in the zone known as Punta de San Jose on
the Nicaraguan side of the gulf.
</P>
<P>
The Gulf of Fonseca is shared by Honduras, Nicaragua and El
Salvador, and the lack of border markings has caused frequent
captures of fishermen of one of the three countries in the
territorial waters of the other two, and has even caused two armed
conflicts this year.
</P>
<P>
The naval forces of Honduras and Nicaragua accused each other
last February of having provoked shoot-outs between patrol boats
in their waters.
</P>
<P>
Technical missions of the two countries got together on April 7
in Tegucigalpa, the Honduran capital, to listen to the offers of
five companies who offered to sell and install the 14 buoys that
will show the demarcation of the border in the Gulf of Fonseca.
</P>
<P>
However, both governments declared deserted the bidding for the
installation of the buoys in the gulf.
</P>
<P>
The "mother" buoy was placed in 1997 on the borderline between
Honduras and Nicaragua in the gulf, and it is expected that the
other 14 will be installed before the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
As in the Pacific, both nations maintain a similar problem in
the Caribbean since November 30 last year, when the Honduran
Congress ratified with Colombia a maritime limits treaty.
</P>
<P>
Nicaragua says that this treaty takes from its sovereignty 130,
000 square kilometers of its continental platform in the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
The Organization of American States (OAS) intervened at the
request of the two countries with its mediator Luigi Einaudi, who
facilitated a distention environment to prevent an armed
confrontation.

<HEADLINE> Five People Stabbed at High School in Ottawa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Five people were stabbed by a 15-
year-old boy shortly before noon Thursday at an Ottawa-area high
school.
</P>
<P>
Ambulances rushed to the Cairine Wilson high school to take the
victims to nearby hospital. None of the injuries was considered
life threatening.
</P>
<P>
Police arrested the teen suspect after he stabbed three boy and
a girl students along with a female staff member at the school
library.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said the boy began attacking with a kitchen knife at
around 11:30 a.m. after getting into some kind of a dispute with
other students.
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred as security has been beefed up in schools
across Canada to avoid unexpectedness on the anniversary of the
deadly shootings at the U.S. Columbine High School.
</P>
<P>
On April 20, 1999, two teenage gunmen killed 12 students and a
teacher before committing suicide at the Columbine school in
Littleton, Colorado.

<HEADLINE> Elian's Father Calls Americans to Help Reunite with His Son </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He made the appeal in Spanish with a translator in front of a
Cuban diplomatic residence in Bethesda, Maryland, where he has
been staying waiting for a reunion with his son since he came to
the United States on April 6.
</P>
<P>
"I really wish to be with my son. He belongs to me," Gonzalez
said, urging the American people to contact both U.S. President
Bill Clinton and Attorney General Janet Reno on his behalf.
</P>
<P>
"Don't let them (the Miami relatives) continue to abuse my son,
" Gonzalez said. "It hurts me a lot to see what they are doing to
my son."
</P>
<P>
Reno has repeatedly insisted that the boy should be returned to
his father. On Wednesday, She said that the Justice Department
will abide by an appeals court rule over the case of Elian
Gonzalez, but stressed that the rule will not prevent the
government from transferring the six-year-old Cuban boy to his
father.
</P>
<P>
"The immigration laws clearly call for a child to be placed in
the care of a parent, in preference to a more distant relative,
while the child's immigration status is being resolved," Reno told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
The court panel decided to bar anyone from attempting to remove
the Cuban shipwreck survivor from the country, extending the
injunction issued last week.
</P>
<P>
The panel announced that they recognized the government's
authority over immigration matters, but adding that "We fail to
see how an injunction in the case infringes upon the congressional
power."
</P>
<P>
However, she made it clear that the court rule "does not
preclude me from placing Elian in his father's care while he is in
the United States."
</P>
<P>
Elian was rescued on November 25 near a shipwreck after his
mother and 10 others were killed when their boat capsized in the
sea off Florida and later was sent to his relatives in Miami.
</P>
<P>
The appeals court order temporarily blocked anyone from taking
Elian out of the country until it decides whether to hear the
asylum claims.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Europe's major stock markets
closed mostly higher Thursday, bolstered by shares of media, oil,
and tobacco companies as a four-day holiday weekend got under way.
</P>
<P>
The FTSE 100 in London rose 56.3 points, or 0.9 percent, to 6,
241.2, returning to the black after early losses as top media and
drug companies pulled the index higher.
</P>
<P>
SmithKline reported a 15 percent jump in earnings per share to
6.9 pence while Glaxo said turnover in the quarter to end-March
rose 12 percent to 2.125 billion pounds.

The FTSE Eurotop 300, a broader measure of the region's largest
companies, added 0.8 at 1,589.92. Sub-indexes for tobacco and
media stocks rose, while steel, automotive and technology
companies were lower.
</P>
<P>
Dealers were hard pressed to summon up much enthusiasm as
proceedings wound down ahead of the four-day Easter weekend.
</P>
<P>
"There's not really any pattern out there. Compared with the
volatility that's been in the market, it's been very, very quiet,"
said one dealer.
</P>
<P>
In Paris, the bourse ended higher as a slew of corporate news --
including disclosure of Dresdner Bank's 3.6 percent stake in
Credit Lyonnais -- lifted the market ahead of the Easter weekend.
</P>
<P>
The CAC 40 ended up 68.05 or 1.1 percent at 6,234.51 points.
The index has gained 168.80 since last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Germany's Xetra Dax index eased in light trade ahead of the
Easter weekend as falls by software company SAP and

<HEADLINE> Colombian Government, ELN Reach Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BOGOTA, April 20 (Xinhua) -- The Colombian government and the
rebel National Liberation Army (ELN) agreed Thursday to establish
a demilitarized zone in the north of the country.
</P>
<P>
The agreement is the first between the government and that
armed guerrilla group, the second in importance after the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). The authorities are
holding peace talks with it.
</P>
<P>
The zone of dissension will be formed by three municipalities:
Yong Do (Antioquia), San Pablo, and Santa Gallo (Bolivar), both
departments located in the north of the country, according to
reports from the Caracol Television Channel.
</P>
<P>
The ELN seeks to hold in the demilitarized zone what it defines
as a National Convention for the peace of the country, immersed in
an armed conflict for 40 years.
</P>
<P>
The agreement with the government follows the release by the
ELN of five crew members and three passengers of an Avianca
airliner hijacked more than one year ago by this guerrilla group,
and the announcement of an Easter truce.
</P>
<P>
The Colombian ambassador to Cuba and government negotiator with
the ELN, Julio Londono Paredes, met Wednesday with Colombian
President Andres Pastrana to analyze a proposal from the guerrilla
group.
</P>
<P>
The possible establishment of a demilitarized zone to pave the
way for the peace process with the ELN has provoked protests from
the heads of the peasant communities in the south of Bolivar, and
even from the mayors.
</P>
<P>
Monte Cristo municipality mayor Jesus Barragan revealed that
Santa Rosa is prepared to reject the guerrillas and the
paramilitary alike, since it is fed up with both.
</P>
<P>
He warned the government that it should consult the matter with
the local communities before arriving at any agreement with the
ELN, or else the people would abandon Monte Cristo.
</P>
<P>
The south of Bolivar is a zone disputed by the ELN and the
paramilitary groups, and for this cause the local peasants have
suffered an escalation of violence.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Refuses to Use Eritrean Ports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian Prime Minister
Meles Zenawi reiterated here on Thursday that his country would
not use Eritrean ports for the shipment of food aid to the drought
victims.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Meles said that it would take
at least two months to rehabilitate Eritrean ports of Assab and
Massawa, which had been out of operations for long period.
</P>
<P>
It would be unthinkable to ferry relief food via Eritrean
ports, as they are full of soldiers and mines, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia and Eritrean have been at war since May 1998 over
border dispute. Ethiopia used to make use of Eritrean ports for
imports and exports before the war erupted.
</P>
<P>
Meles also accused the Eritrean government of having looted
more than 70, 000 tons of relief assistance destined for Ethiopia
in the past.
</P>
<P>
Meles said the combined capacity of Djibouti port and the
Somali port of Berbera was big enough to deal with Ethiopia's
monthly relief food requirement of 175,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the pressure put by some foreign countries and
 organizations on Ethiopia to use the Eritrean ports was unjust
and politically motivated and aimed at complicating relief
operations.

</P>
<P>
"I think he should be reunited with his son. That is the law
and the main argument of the family in Miami for not doing so has
now been removed," Clinton told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, the boy's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez,
asked Americans to write to Clinton and Attorney General Janet
Reno to pressure them to reunite him with Elian.
</P>
<P>
"The court has now said he shouldn't go back to Cuba. The
Justice Department agrees with that and he (the father) has agreed
to that so there now is no conceivable argument for his not being
able to be reunited with his son," Clinton added.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta
issued an order that keeps Elian in the United States pending an
appeal for an asylum filed by the relatives in Miami for the boy.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Begins Talks with Arafat over Mideast peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 20 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton on
Thursday expressed his hope that Israel and the Palestinians could
bridge their differences so that a framework agreement could be
reached in May, thus smoothing the way for a final agreement in
September.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a photo session with Palestinian President Yasser
Arafat, who arrived earlier in the day for talks, at the White
House, Clinton said the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations "reached
a very serious time in the peace process."
</P>
<P>
President Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak "have
set for themselves an ambitious timetable to reach a framework
agreement as soon as they can and then a final agreement by the
middle of September. So we are working hard on it, and I think we'
ll get some things done today," Clinton told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this afternoon, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
met Arafat at her Georgetown residence. State Department spokesman
James Rubin did not disclose anything about their discussions at a
regular briefing, saying he was not aware of any new U.S. ideas
being presented, but he did not rule out the possibility of "
creative suggestions" at some points.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said that the United States was prepared to play a more
active role in the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations as the
September deadline for a final status agreement was drawing nearer.
</P>
<P>
"Everyone agreed that we will play a more involved role by
being at the table, trying to be creative, trying to help each
side figure out what its needs are," Rubin told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he would do whatever he could to help bridge the
gap between Israel and the Palestinians over a series of issues,
like the borders, Jerusalem, refugees and Jewish settlements.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said President Clinton
wanted to use the face-to-face talks to make sure what Washington
could do to help Israeli-Palestinian negotiations move toward a
framework agreement and then a final status agreement.
</P>
<P>
"I think the president thought it would be useful and effective
to use this time to meet directly to see what we can do to keep
these (talks) on track," he said.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Clinton held talks with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak to try to renew momentum in the negotiations between Israel
and the Palestinians as the target date for a framework agreement
in May is drawing nearer while gaps still remained wide between
the two parties.
</P>
<P>
Lockhart said both Israelis and Palestinians were facing very
difficult issues, saying that "they have a very tight time line."
</P>
<P>
The second round of Bolling Air Force Base negotiations between
Israeli and the Palestinian delegations ended last weekend with an
exchange of position papers on the framework agreement but no
evidence of substantial progress.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials say that Washington is trying to help bridge the
gaps but it has not reached the stage of proposing compromises.
</P>
<P>
Arafat said on Monday that he would take some "positive ideas"
to the White House, and considered his trip to Washington "a
crucial and basic step to push the peace process forward."
</P>
<P>
Palestinian cabinet minister Hassan Asfour on Tuesday held out
little hope for a breakthrough when Arafat meets Clinton.
</P>
<P>
"We have nothing new to add, he said. "There is no place for
more flexibility. We were the party which made a historical
concession in 1993 and not the Israelis."
</P>
<P>
1993 was the year of the Oslo accords between Israel and the
PLO.
