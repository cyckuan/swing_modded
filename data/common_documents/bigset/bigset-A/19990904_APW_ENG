	Alan Shearer scored three goals and Steve McManaman added two as  
England routed Luxembourg 6-0 in one of 19 European Championship 
qualifiers Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Shearer, in his first international three-goal game, converted a  
penalty kick in the 11th minute, then connected in the 28th and 
35th at Wembley, England. 
</P>
<P>
	McManaman had never scored in 24 previous international  
appearances. Michael Owen added a goal in the final minute, a 
curling shot from just outside the penalty area. 
</P>
<P>
	Sweden (5-0-1) leads Group Five with 16 points, four ahead of  
England (3-1-3) and Poland (4-2), which meet Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Davor Suker, the top scorer at last year's World Cup, scored  
just before the final whistle to give first-place Croatia (4-1-2) a 
1-0 win over visiting Ireland (4-2) in Group Eight. 
</P>
<P>
	Erden Arif scored three goals in a four-minute span as Turkey

tournament. Co-hosts Belgium and the Netherlands, who tied 5-5 in 
an exhibition game Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	World Cup champion France played a scoreless tie against  
visiting Armenia. The French (4-1-3) are one point behind Group

<HEADLINE> Soccer Parents Ordered To Button Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Fed up with loudmouthed coaches and parents, a  
girls' soccer league has proclaimed a game day of silence in 
October where the only sounds should be those coming from the 
field. 
</P>
<P>
	The 200-team Northern Ohio Girls Soccer League is calling Oct. 3  
Silent Sunday and encouraging parents and others to be on their 
best behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea comes in response to loutish behavior from parents in  
the stands and several cases of overzealous coaches, including some 
who verbally abused referees, league officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to problems with the coaches, the noise surrounding  
the field was becoming unbelievable, said Al Soper, the president 
of the league for girls ages 8-14. 
</P>
<P>
	``No wonder the kids were getting confused,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Soper, who is also a league referee, said the noise from yelling  
parents prompts coaches to yell, which in turn sets a bad example 
for children. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Pacula, a league official, supports the concept. He said  
that while cheering and applause were fine, bad coaching and 
criticism are not. 
</P>
<P>
	He also says that many children playing the game know it much  
better than their parents, who never played themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet the parents show up and begin shouting out directions or  
coaching from the stands, which confuses kids and upsets coaches, 
Pacula said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Winning isn't the only thing at this age,'' he said. ``We want  
to just let them play.''

<HEADLINE> Investigators To Review Waco Tapes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (AP) -- Investigators are reviewing  
footage obtained by a Colorado filmmaker to see if it shows U.S. 
armed forces firing into David Koresh's compound at the close of 
the Waco standoff, a U.S. congressman says. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have those tapes and have given them to two experts to  
analyze,'' Rep. Dan Burton, chairman of the House Government Reform 
Committee, said Friday. ``Two separate entities are looking at them 
frame-by-frame.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He refused to disclose what individuals are reviewing the film.  
</P>
<P>
	Filmmaker Mike McNulty said he obtained the infrared film, taken  
by an FBI surveillance aircraft at about 9,000 feet, through the 
Freedom of Information Act. 
</P>
<P>
	Burton's committee is investigating the Waco siege which ended  
with the death of Koresh and about 80 of his followers. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile in Texas, a federal judge handling a lawsuit brought  
by survivors of the siege was forced to intervene after federal 
agents tried to keep Texas Rangers from entering a Waco storage 
facility to search for evidence, the Dallas Morning News reported 
in Saturday's editions. 
</P>
<P>
	Agents with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms assigned  
to maintain custody of a storage locker containing evidence 
recovered from Koresh's compound reportedly told the Rangers that 
their lawyers in Washington had ordered them to deny the Rangers 
entry, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Law enforcement officials in Texas, speaking on the condition of  
anonymity, told the newspaper that the Rangers were allowed to 
search boxes only after U.S. District Judge Walter Smith was 
called. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rangers were looking for a spent pyrotechnic device that was  
photographed in 1993 by investigators at the Branch Davidian 
compound. Texas officials said they did not find the missing round 
at the storage locker. 
</P>
<P>
	McNulty, the filmmaker, claimed to participants at a Republican  
retreat Friday that his footage indicates that the Army's secretive 
Delta Forces fired at least 60 rounds into Koresh's compound 51 
days after the seige started on Feb. 28, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Pentagon officials have said three Army special forces officers  
were at the scene, but were there only as observers. 
</P>
<P>
	Only under tightly prescribed rules is the military allowed to  
participate in domestic law enforcement operations. 
</P>
<P>
	If it turns out that military forces did open fire without  
proper authorization, ``then those who did it will and should be 
prosecuted,'' said Burton.

<HEADLINE>  East Timor Votes for Independence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DILI, Indonesia (AP) -- Pro-Indonesia militiamen attacked U.N.  
offices and vehicles in East Timor on Saturday, wounding one 
American and prompting the evacuation of U.N. staff just hours 
after the world body announced that residents overwhelmingly voted 
for independence. 
</P>
<P>
	Gunfire in the provincial capital of Dili continued well into  
Sunday morning, and many feared the vote results could spark a 
civil war. The number of casualties from the shootings was unknown. 
</P>
<P>
	U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan announced Friday night what  
was apparent all week -- that East Timorese had voted in a landslide 
to end a quarter-century of often brutal Indonesian rule. U.N. 
officials said that 344,580 people, or 78.5 percent, voted to split 
with the world's fourth most-populous nation. 
</P>
<P>
	The news triggered a violent backlash by anti-independence  
forces, who had favored autonomy within Indonesia and had tried to 
disrupt the vote by attacking U.N. workers. At least four local 
U.N. workers were killed this week and another six were missing and 
feared dead. 
</P>
<P>
	One U.S. police adviser, whose name was not disclosed, was shot  
in the abdomen by men in Indonesian police uniforms during an 
ambush near the town of Liquica, diplomats and U.N. workers said on 
customary condition of anonymity. U.N. officials said he was not in 
serious condition and would be flown to Australia, 370 miles to the 
southeast. 
</P>
<P>
	Jose Alexandre ``Xanana'' Gusmao, a hero of East Timor's  
independence movement, issued an appeal from Jakarta -- where he is 
under house arrest -- for the U.N. Security Council to deploy a 
multinational peacekeeping force immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesian leaders have so far refused to allow foreign  
peacekeepers into the country. But officials said Saturday that 
Gusmao would be released Wednesday and be allowed to return to 
Dili. 
</P>
<P>
	The violence did not bode well for the United Nations, which  
will take control of East Timor when the referendum's results are 
certified by Indonesia's highest legislative body, the People's 
Consultative Assembly, or MPR. 
</P>
<P>
	Militia attacks and death threats forced the U.N. to evacuate 60  
staff members Saturday from Liquica and another town, Same. Gunmen 
repeatedly shot into a hotel in Dili, the capital, where top U.N. 
officials and many journalists stay. 
</P>
<P>
	Some U.N. staff were to leave Dili earlier then planned and  
others will be stationed in Darwin, Australia, said U.N. spokesman 
David Wimhurst. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesian authorities appeared to be ignoring the violence,  
refusing to acknowledge international media reports, videotapes and 
photographs of armed pro-Indonesia militia roaming the streets of 
Dili. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no report that the militia are carrying guns and  
walking on the street,'' Brig. Gen. Sudradjat, the chief spokesman 
for the armed forces, told Associated Press Television News in 
Jakarta, Indonesia's capital. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesia has thousands of soldiers and police in the territory,  
but they have generally stood by as militias attack their rivals 
and, increasingly, the unarmed U.N. mission. The security forces 
have been accused of arming and backing the militias. They deny the 
allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Indonesian government will be responsible for the security  
and safety in East Timor until at least the next MPR sessions in 
November,'' State Secretary Muladi said. The MPR is widely expected 
to respect the referendum and grant East Timor independence. 
</P>
<P>
	Muladi, who is also Indonesia's justice minister and like many  
Indonesians uses only one name, announced Gusmao's release after 
meeting with President B.J. Habibie and the military and police 
chiefs to discuss East Timor. 
</P>
<P>
	Gusmao, 53, is widely expected to become the president of the  
fledgling nation, which has a population of 850,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Arrested in 1992, he is revered by many East Timorese for his  
struggle against the leadership of this giant, predominantly Muslim 
nation. He was initially sentenced to life in prison, but the 
sentence was later reduced to 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Before his release was announced, ambassadors from the United  
States, Britain, Australia and New Zealand met Habibie in Jakarta. 
The nations have been among the most vocal in demanding Habibie's 
commitment to end the violence. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Ambassador Stapleton Roy told reporters that the talks  
focused on ways ``the international community could be helpful'' in 
restoring security, but did not include a proposal for 
peacekeepers. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesia invaded East Timor in 1975 after fighting broke out  
following Portugal's hasty departure from its former colony. 
Authoritarian President Suharto refused to consider independence 
for East Timor, but central control has slipped since he was 
toppled last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics of independence, particularly within the powerful  
military, fear that freedom for East Timor will encourage 
separatism in other parts of Indonesia, a far-flung nation of 
13,000 islands and 210 million people.

<HEADLINE> McCain Challenged on Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- Some conservation groups are challenging  
Republican presidential contender John McCain's record on the 
environment, even as McCain says his party should tackle the 
environmental issues it has long neglected. 
</P>
<P>
	``McCain has been a leader on certain Arizona issues, but that  
hasn't translated to the national level,'' said Lisa Wade, 
spokeswoman for the League of Conservation Voters. 
</P>
<P>
	In the last two years, McCain scored 29 percent and 0 percent,  
respectively, on the league's National Environmental Score Card. 
Congressmen are rated annually according to votes on issues such as 
mining, public lands and the storage of nuclear waste. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain has come under fire for trying to eliminate tax credits  
to ethanol and methanol producers. The tax credit program was 
designed two decades ago to promote a clean, homegrown alternative 
to imported oil. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain says the program is wasteful government spending.  
</P>
<P>
	He also has been criticized for writing legislation that  
re-authorized military use of a 2.7 million-acre bombing range in 
Arizona, and similar ranges in other states. 
</P>
<P>
	But during a recent trip to New Hampshire, McCain emphasized his  
environmental accomplishments. He helped place 3.5 million acres of 
Arizona land into ``pristine wilderness status,'' reduce the number 
of noisy flights over the Grand Canyon and regulate water flow from 
dams to protect the national treasure. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly in the Grand Canyon, John McCain has been a  
champion,'' said Rob Smith, Southwest staff director of the Sierra 
Club. ``But as a national senator, he certainly hasn't broken ranks 
with the anti-environmental Republican leadership of the current 
Congress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCain acknowledged Friday that Republicans should do more for  
the environment. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a party, we need to get back to some of the environmental  
issues that we may not have paid as much attention to,'' he told 
members of the New Hampshire Republicans for Responsible 
Conservation.

<HEADLINE>  U.S. Women's Soccer 5, Ireland 0 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FOXBORO, Mass. (AP) -- There was no world championship at stake.  
The stadium was only half-full. None of the players took off her 
shirt. 
</P>
<P>
	Sill, it was a successful reunion for the U.S. women's soccer  
team on Saturday when the players got together for the first time 
since their World Cup victory and beat Ireland 5-0. 
</P>
<P>
	Tiffeny Milbrett had two goals and an assist for the United  
States, which shook off the rust of a well-earned rest to begin its 
tuneup for the Sydney Olympics. Julie Foudy, Joy Fawcett and 
Kristine Lilly also scored for the Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. women became national celebrities after beating China  
in a World Cup final shootout in front of 90,185 at the Rose Bowl 
in Pasadena, Calif., and a domestic television audience estimated 
at 40 million. Since then, the players have been showered with 
autograph requests, endorsement contracts and cereal box covers. 
</P>
<P>

pass and she redirected it past Byrne for a 2-0 lead.

<HEADLINE> Montague Back After Missing Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- National League umpire Ed Montague was back on  
the field Saturday and wasn't happy with Sandy Alderson, an 
executive in the commissioner's office who questioned whether he 
was ill the previous night. 
</P>
<P>
	Montague missed Friday's game after consulting with a trainer,  
saying he was dehydrated. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the doctor prescribes Gatorade for a malady, you have to  
be skeptical,'' Alderson, executive vice president for baseball 
operations in the commissioner's office, said Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Alderson added that baseball normally reviews the situation when  
an umpire misses a game because of illness. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who is he to comment on something like that?'' Montague said.  
``For him to question my integrity ... I would put my integrity 
against his any day. My integrity has never been questioned. My 
attendance record is nearly perfect for 24 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last night ... it was a bad night because I usually will work.  
Today was a blah day, but there was no way I wasn't coming to work 
after what he said.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Montague is a strong supporter of union head Richie Phillips.  
Montague's wife wrote a letter in July to the wife of AL ump John 
Hirschbeck, saying the dissident leader was a ``Judas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Richie Phillips is our guy,'' Montague said. ``He has gotten  
me and this association everything we have today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then, pointing to the other three members of his umpiring crew --  
Mike Winters, Kerwin Danley and newcomer Anthony Randazzo -- 
Montague said: ``I love Richie Phillips and so do these guys.''

<P>
	FOXBORO, Mass. (AP) -- There was no world championship at stake.  
The stadium was only half-full. None of the players took off her 
shirt. 
</P>
<P>
	Sill, it was a successful reunion for the U.S. women's soccer  
team on Saturday when the players got together for the first time 
since their World Cup victory and beat Ireland 5-0. 
</P>
<P>
	Tiffeny Milbrett had two goals and an assist for the United  
States, which shook off the rust of a well-earned rest to begin its 
tuneup for the Sydney Olympics. Julie Foudy, Joy Fawcett and 
Kristine Lilly also scored for the Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. women became national celebrities after beating China  
in a World Cup final shootout in front of 90,185 at the Rose Bowl 
in Pasadena, Calif., and a domestic television audience estimated 
at 40 million. Since then, the players have been showered with 
autograph requests, endorsement contracts and cereal box covers.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Yevgeny Kafelnikov says only three players are  
in the running to win the men's singles title at the U.S. Open: 
Andre Agassi, Richard Krajicek and himself. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can guarantee you now that one of the three guys will win  
the U.S. Open,'' Kafelnikov said Saturday after defeating Jonas 
Bjorkman 6-1, 6-4, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he was more confident than ever about winning at the  
National Tennis Center, Kafelnikov said: 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't get me wrong. I do afraid of Richard Krajicek and I do  
afraid of Andre Agassi. Those are my picks, I just told you that. 
If I would have been confident, I would have told you I'm going to 
win the U.S. Open, but I did not say that.''

No. 6 Serena Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact that the four highest ranked women in the country  
have committed to play Fed Cup speaks highly about the state of the

<HEADLINE> Who Deserves Credit for Prosperity? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Bill Clinton? George Bush? Alan Greenspan?  
Congress? Just who should get the credit for America's good times? 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats and Republicans, looking ahead to next year's  
presidential and congressional elections, are already trying to 
convince voters that their party did the most to bring about the 
current prosperity. 
</P>
<P>
	When economists instead of politicians are asked to supply an  
answer, they generally give the most credit to Greenspan and his 
colleagues at the Federal Reserve, for what they see as sure-footed 
handling of monetary policy. 
</P>
<P>
	But they also say President Clinton and former President George  
Bush deserve a share of praise, as do members of Congress. Congress 
was willing to support a string of budget pacts that, starting in 
1990, first gained control of the soaring federal deficits and 
then, last year, pushed the budget into surplus. 
</P>
<P>
	The benefit from reducing government's borrowing demands comes  
in lower interest rates, which helps interest-sensitive sectors of 
the economy like autos and home construction. And just as 
importantly, lower rates help businesses: It costs them less to 
invest in new factories and equipment and enhance productivity. 
</P>
<P>
	Rising productivity, the amount of output per hour of work, is  
crucial to rising living standards because it allows businesses to 
pay their workers more without raising prices and setting off 
inflationary pressures. 
</P>
<P>
	Productivity increased by 2.2 percent last year, more than  
double the weak 1 percent average gains of the previous two 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
	While economists dispute whether this pickup will be  
long-lasting, no less an authority than Federal Reserve Chairman 
Alan Greenspan believes the pickup in productivity is real -- and 
even undercounted by government statistics. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, the Federal Reserve has been willing to allow the  
unemployment rate to fall far below levels that once would have 
caused the central bank to worry about rising wage demands 
triggering higher inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed did begin nudging rates higher on June 30 in an effort  
to slow the economy a bit. But the Fed's action came only after the 
jobless rate had dipped to a three-decade low of 4.2 percent. 
That's far below the 6 percent level formerly considered the 
threshold when tight labor markets start pushing inflation higher. 
</P>
<P>
	So far the Fed's decision to let good times roll has not caused  
inflation problems. In fact, consumer prices last year rose by just 
1.6 percent, the best showing in 11 years. Despite a big rebound in 
energy costs, prices this year are increasing by just over 2 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The global currency crisis, depressing world demand for the past  
two years, also has lowered prices in the United States for oil, 
cars and other imports. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists who acknowledge a pickup in productivity are  
marveling at the nation's fortunate combination of low inflation 
and low unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
	``Government policy has played a role in the economy's stellar  
performance,'' says Mark Zandi, economist at Regional Financial 
Associates in West Chester, Pa., ``but we have also benefited from 
a good dose of just plain luck.''

<HEADLINE> Hungry Asian Beetle Menaces Trees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- An alien invader is casting a hungry eye on one  
of America's greatest natural resources. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a bug the size of a child's thumb, and already it has  
destroyed thousands of trees in New York and Chicago. What's worse, 
the Asian long-horned beetle can only be eliminated by destroying 
its victims -- killing the trees to save the forest. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is really our Public Enemy No. 1 in the pest world right  
now,'' said Michael Dunn, an Agriculture Department undersecretary 
overseeing the anti-beetle efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	Believed to have migrated in wooded crates from China, North  
America's first Asian long-horned beetles were discovered three 
years ago in Brooklyn, but they likely bored their way into the 
trees years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Recently, Asian long-horned beetles were found in Manhattan,  
just blocks from the city's green jewel, Central Park. Officials 
worry the beetles already may be ravaging some of the park's 26,000 
trees. 
</P>
<P>
	``They should be very afraid,'' said Cornell University  
entomologist Richard Hoebeke, an expert on the Asian long-horned 
beetle. ``It's alarming to know it's that close to Central Park.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 3,800 hardwood trees -- maple, elm, ash, willow, poplar,  
horse chestnut -- have been destroyed in New York City and around 
Amityville on Long Island. The toll in Chicago, the only other city 
known to have infestations, is close to 1,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts believe the beetle arrived in the mid-1980s by burrowing  
into wooden crates and palettes from China, where raw, 
insect-infested wood often is used to package exports. 
</P>
<P>
	The Agriculture Department banned untreated packaging from  
entering the United States last year. But officials still have to 
fight the beetles that already arrived and their offspring. 
</P>
<P>
	Because pesticides are powerless against the beetles, the only  
way to stop their spread is to uproot infested trees and burn the 
wood. Most of the trees would die anyway from the holes bored in 
their trunks. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents of Chicago's Ravenswood neighborhood have watched  
workers remove hundreds of trees since Asian long-horned beetles 
were discovered there last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``They literally went from tree-lined blocks with trees that  
were 40, 50, 60 years old, beautiful canopies over the street, to 
bare parkways,'' said Terry Levin, a spokesman for Chicago Mayor 
Richard Daley. 
</P>
<P>
	The voracious beetles, usually between an inch and two inches  
long, are coal black with white spots and long antennae. 
</P>
<P>
	Females chew through bark to lay their eggs. When the larvae  
hatch, they feed inside the tree for more than a year. Eventually 
they tunnel out, boring dime-sized holes in the trunks, and then 
restart the cycle. 
</P>
<P>
	The damage is almost always fatal.  
</P>
<P>
	The federal government has spent $10 million fighting  
infestations so far, and state and local governments have laid out 
millions more. Experts believe the problem may extend beyond New 
York and Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bomb is ticking,'' Hoebeke said. ``My guess is this beetle  
will turn up this year in some other major city.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bugs -- but no affected trees -- have been found at import  
warehouses in Houston; Seattle; Charleston, S.C.; Long Beach and 
Oakland, Calif.; Portland, Ore.; Toronto and Vancouver, Canada, 
among other cities. 
</P>
<P>
	Import hubs are most at risk. In Chicago, the infestation's  
epicenter was the backyard of a hardware company that received 
goods from China. Damaged trees were found this week in a forest 
preserve near O'Hare International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, a visitor last month spotted beetle damage in trees  
on a Manhattan playground half a mile from Central Park. The 
once-lush playground has gone from oasis to ``suntanning field,'' 
said Joseph Gittelman, who runs the USDA's beetle project on Long 
Island. 
</P>
<P>
	Workers removed 23 trees from the playground and are now  
examining Central Park's hardwoods. 
</P>
<P>
	Mindful of the ravages of Dutch elm disease, which decimated  
American elms, officials worry for millions of acres of woodlands, 
particularly in the Northeast and Canada, which have more of the 
beetle's favorite trees than the West. Maple syrup producers and 
the forestry industry are nervously tracking the beetle's progress. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know where it's going to all end,'' Hoebeke said.

<HEADLINE> Redskins Cut Kicker Hall, 17 Others </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ASHBURN, Va. (AP) -- Jeff Hall was fighting back tears. Nigel  
Williams muttered an obscenity and smacked the front door on his 
way out. 
</P>
<P>
	While the players who made the Washington Redskins final 53-man  
roster took the field Saturday to begin preparations for the season 
opener against Dallas, the ones who didn't make the cut packed 
their gear and took the news as best they could. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can say leaving here that I gave everything that I had, down  
to eating my Wheaties in the morning,'' said Hall, his voice 
cracking with emotion. ``The hardest part, I think, is not the 
actual getting cut. The hardest part is leaving people that you 
meet, and you go to Bible studies with and build relationships. 
That's the tough part.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hall, a kicker drafted in the sixth round, helped Tennessee win  
the national championship last year, but a terrible shank on a 
23-yard field goal attempt in his first exhibition game sealed his 
fate with the Redskins. Brett Conway won the job, beating out both 
Hall and Cary Blanchard. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just told him to hang in there,'' said Conway, who spent his  
last three training camps with three different teams. ``He's a good 
enough kicker to kick in this league.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Redskins cut 18 players and traded for another, acquiring  
defensive tackle Barron Tanner from Miami for a sixth-round draft 
pick in 2001. Tanner, a third-year player with one career start, 
will provide backup run-stopping support behind Dan Wilkinson and 
Dana Stubblefield. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, a receiver who spent the last four seasons in the CFL,  
was one of the surprises of the spring workouts and appeared in the 
running to become the regular third-down receiver, but he started 
dropping passes regularly once training camp began. His fate was 
essentially sealed two weeks ago when the Redskins lured Irving 
Fryar out of retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	All of the players released Saturday have little or no NFL  
experience.

<HEADLINE> Soccer Parents Ordered To Button Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Fed up with loudmouthed coaches and parents, a  
girls' soccer league has proclaimed a game day of silence in 
October where the only sounds should be those coming from the 
field. 
</P>
<P>
	The 200-team Northern Ohio Girls Soccer League is calling Oct. 3  
Silent Sunday and encouraging parents and others to be on their 
best behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea comes in response to loutish behavior from parents in  
the stands and several cases of overzealous coaches, including some 
who verbally abused referees, league officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to problems with the coaches, the noise surrounding  
the field was becoming unbelievable, said Al Soper, the president 
of the league for girls ages 8-14. 
</P>
<P>
	``No wonder the kids were getting confused,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Soper, who is also a league referee, said the noise from yelling  
parents prompts coaches to yell, which in turn sets a bad example 
for children. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Pacula, a league official, supports the concept. He said  
that while cheering and applause were fine, bad coaching and 
criticism are not. 
</P>
<P>
	He also says that many children playing the game know it much  
better than their parents, who never played themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet the parents show up and begin shouting out directions or  
coaching from the stands, which confuses kids and upsets coaches, 
Pacula said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Winning isn't the only thing at this age,'' he said. ``We want  
to just let them play.''

	Israel, Palestinians End Deadlock  
</P>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Ending years of deadlock and distrust, Israel  
and the Palestinians concluded a new West Bank land-for-security 
agreement that also charts the course toward a historic final peace 
accord by September 2000. The deal comes after weeks of often 
agonizing haggling, with negotiators prodded along into the 
decisive final stage by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. Now, 
however, events will unfold with breathtaking speed. A signing 
ceremony is set for Saturday in the Egyptian Red Sea resort of 
Sharm el-Sheik, which Albright will attend. On Sunday, Israel will 
withdraw from 7 percent of the West Bank and release scores of 
Palestinian security prisoners.

	E. Timorese Choose Independence  
</P>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan urged  
pro-Jakarta militias on Friday to accept the results of a historic 
ballot in East Timor calling for independence from Indonesia. 
``There are no winners or losers today,'' Annan told a hushed open 
meeting of the U.N. Security Council as he announced the 
independence victory from Monday's balloting. More than 23 years 
after Indonesia invaded the former Portuguese colony, the voters 
rejected wide-ranging autonomy within Indonesia by 78.5 percent, he 
said. The U.N. Security Council, in a presidential statement, 
underlined the need to implement the results ``in an atmosphere of 
peace and security without further violence and intimidation.''

	BIG BEAR LAKE, Calif. (AP) -- On Friday more than 2,100  
firefighters aided by planes, helicopters and bulldozers were 
battling the 63,375-acre Willow fire in the San Bernardino 
Mountains. The blaze, which started Aug. 28, was one of seven large 
fires in California. Most other fires in the West were contained. 
Big Bear Lake and the other popular resorts 90 miles east of Los 
Angeles were depending on the firefighters to keep flames away 
through the lucrative Labor Day Weekend. Fire officials said the

	Laser Flaws Admitted by Energy Dept.  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Energy Secretary Bill Richardson is ordering  
an overhaul of an ambitious $1.2 billion program to build the 
world's largest laser after finding hundreds of millions of dollars 
in cost overruns. Richardson said he was erroneously assured as 
recently as June that the project at the Lawrence Livermore 
National Laboratory in California was on target and within budget. 
The massive laser, which will be housed in a facility as large as a 
football field and include 192 beams once completed, is a key part 
of a program to monitor and maintain America's nuclear warheads 
without actually testing them.

lawyer, have been charged with growing and possessing marijuana 
after their 16-year-old daughter turned them in. Robert Alvarez and 
his wife, Kathleen Tucker, turned themselves in to Takoma Park, Md. 
police on Monday, 11 days after their daughter, Kerry Tucker, told 
police the couple had drugs in their basement. They were released 
on their own recognizance. The couple's lawyer, Steven Kupferberg, 
told The Washington Post that the charges ``will eventually be 
lowered to simple possession.'' Kupferberg said Tucker uses the 
marijuana to treat migraines and chronic muscle pain.

	Key Nations Seek New Policy on Iraq  
</P>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The United States has invited the other  
permanent members of the Security Council to meet next week to try 
to narrow differences on a new policy toward Iraq. But China said 
Friday it had to confer with its leadership in Beijing. More than 
eight months after U.N. weapons inspectors pulled out of Iraq, the 
five permanent council members -- the United States, Britain, 
France, Russia and China -- remain split in two camps on future arms 
monitoring and on whether to suspend sanctions imposed after Iraq's 
1990 invasion of Kuwait.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Mothers who suffer from depression need to  
seek help because their blues could affect their children's

on developmental tests if their mothers are depressed, but a

	Romanowski Issues Apology on Drugs  
</P>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Denver Broncos linebacker Bill Romanowski, under  
investigation for obtaining a prescription drug through fraud, 
issued an apology after Friday night's exhibition win over San 
Francisco. ``I can't talk about any of that right now,'' Romanowski 
said, ``but I apologize to my teammates, the organization and all 
the fans that support me. Douglas County sheriff's officials said 
Romanowski's wife, Julie, and another woman allegedly obtained 
bogus prescriptions from a doctor for the drug Phentermine and gave 
it to Romanowski for his personal use. The drug is an appetite 
suppressant but also acts as a stimulant.

<HEADLINE> Fast Food Sales Soar in Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- Despite the economic slump,  
international fast-food chains in Thailand are reporting sharp 
sales increases and plan to expand their local outlets, a newspaper 
reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The chains, including Kentucky Fried Chicken, McDonald's and  
Pizza Hut, averaged a 15 percent sales growth during the first half 
of the year, as compared to a 12 percent drop for all of 1998, The 
Nation newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	American-style fast food has become solidly entrenched in  
Thailand despite its relatively high prices and a wealth of 
traditional Thai-style snacks available in roadside stands. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers tightened their belts following the mid-1997 economic  
crisis, but spending in some areas has increased with signs of a 
partial recovery on the horizon. 
</P>
<P>
	The fast food leader, Kentucky Fried Chicken, has allocated $2.6  
million to open 17 more outlets this year and forecasts that sales 
for the year will increase from last year's $89.5 million to $118.4 
million, according to the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	McDonald's, which plans to add seven more restaurants this year,  
enjoyed a 26 percent sales growth in the first seven months of 
1999, while Pizza Hut saw second quarter profits rise by 20.1 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Kentucky Fried Chicken has a 26 percent share of the fast food  
market, followed by McDonald's with 12 percent and Pizza Hut with 
11 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The total market is estimated to be worth more than $395  
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Kentucky Fried Chicken is expected to have 237 outlets and  
McDonald's 74 by the end of the year.

<HEADLINE> Johnson, May, Ngeny Highlight Meet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RIETI, Italy (AP) -- Michael Johnson comes to this town nestled  
in the mountains to close his season. Fiona May might be heading 
here to close her career. 
</P>
<P>
	And Noah Ngeny will be running at the Rieti Grand Prix II meet  
Sunday with an eye at its history for producing world records at 
the middle distances. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson provided the highlight of the recent World Championships  
at Seville, Spain, by breaking Butch Reynolds' 11-year-old 
400-meter record of 43.29 seconds with an electrifying time of 
43.18. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson will run the 200 at Rieti, his aim being the year's  
fastest time at the distance. 
</P>
<P>
	He has clocked 19.93 twice, at Rome in July and at Brussels on  
Friday. Francis Obikwelu of Nigeria has the fastest 200 time of the 
season, 19.84. Johnson's world record, set at the 1996 Atlanta 
Olympics, is 19.32. 
</P>
<P>
	After Rieti, where Frankie Fredericks' meet record of 19.96 for  
the 200 is likely to go, Johnson will return home to Dallas and 
rest before starting preparations for the 2000 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	May has made it sound like she won't be at Sydney.  
</P>
<P>
	The Italian is contemplating retirement in the aftermath of her  
loss in the long jump at the World Championships, when Niurka 
Montalvo of Spain surpassed her with the next-to-last leap of the 
competition. Italy protested, contending Montalvo had gone past the 
takeoff line, but a six-member Jury of Appeals let the jump stand 
and May was left with the silver. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's 90 percent that I'm retired,'' May, 29, said at the time.  
``I have to reflect on a lot of things. This broke my heart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If the 1995 world champion and 1996 Olympic silver medalist does  
quit, Rieti would be the final international meet of her 
outstanding career. 
</P>
<P>
	The long jump field here includes Greece's Paraskevi Tsiamita,  
the women's triple jump gold medalist at Seville. 
</P>
<P>
	Emerging star Ngeny persuaded meet organizers to add the rarely  
contested 1,000 meters to Sunday's schedule, so he can take a crack 
at a record that has stood for 18 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Sebastian Coe owns the mark of 2:12.18, set at Oslo, Norway, on  
July 11, 1981. 
</P>
<P>
	With its athlete-friendly altitude, hard Mondo track and  
commitment to providing proper pacesetters, Rieti has been the 
backdrop for five world records in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	Ngeny ran the second-fastest 1,000 in history with 2:12.66 on  
July 17, at Nice, France. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kenyan, 20, has quickly established himself as the No. 2  
middle distance runner in the world, behind Hicham El Guerrouj. 
Ngeny was second to El Guerrouj in the 1,500 at Seville, and pushed 
the Moroccan to his record-setting mile run at Rome July 7. Ngeny's 
3:43.40 clocking in that race is the second-fastest mile ever run. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Johnson, May and Ngeny, 15 other medalists from  
the World Championships will be at Rieti. 
</P>
<P>
	They include Italy's Fabrizio Mori, who upset 1997 world  
champion Stephane Diagana of France in the 400-meter hurdles final. 
Diagana gets a rematch in Rieti. 
</P>
<P>
	After the race, Mori will hop on a helicopter outside the  
stadium and fly to Salsomaggiore in northern Italy, to be a judge 
at the Miss Italy pageant.

<HEADLINE> Thrashers Begin First Training Camp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- The Atlanta Thrashers have taken care of  
the paperwork. Now, it's time to find out what kind of team they'll 
put on the ice. 
</P>
<P>
	The NHL's newest franchise takes another historic step Sunday at  
the RDV Sportsplex, holding the first practice of its first 
training camp in the heat of central Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's going to be a lot of nervousness on the part of all of  
us, coaches included,'' said Curt Fraser, preparing for his first 
NHL head coaching job. ``We'll want to get on the ice and see what 
people can do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly everyone on the 65-man roster, comprised largely of  
players other teams didn't want, reported Friday night for a 
meeting with Fraser, who urged them to abandon the expansion-team 
mindset. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday was set aside for physicals, then the Thrashers begin  
practicing with only six days to prepare for their first exhibition 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	While forward Alexei Yegorov and defenseman Sergei Vyshedkevich  
will be delayed at least until Tuesday because of visa problems in 
Russia, the Thrashers' most coveted player was on hand. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta agreed to a three-year contract Friday morning with  
18-year-old Patrik Stefan, the top overall pick in the entry draft. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's something I was pretty nervous about,'' Stefan said.  
``But now it's done. I can play. It's great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Don Waddell said it was important to have Stefan  
in training camp right from the start, even though the 6-foot-2, 
205-pound center will be brought along slowly. 
</P>
<P>
	``From a player standpoint, to be with his teammates from day  
one and not create any negative feelings with them is very, very 
important,'' Waddell said. 
</P>
<P>
	He estimated that at least 32 players have a legitimate chance  
to make the 23-man final roster, which should lead to some spirited 
battles. 
</P>
<P>
	Waddell's message to the players was clear: ``You're all playing  
pro hockey for a reason. You've all been at different levels, but 
you've got a clean slate here. We'll watch how you perform in camp 
and the exhibition games and base our decisions on that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fraser, who won't put the reins on his players in training camp,  
also vows to keep an open mind. 
</P>
<P>
	``We might find someone who can fit in that surprises me,''  
Fraser said. ``Don has done a good job putting a roster together 
and evaluating the talent and it's my job to make sure we get 
something done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Thrashers will divide into four groups to make practice more  
manageable with 65 players in camp. After meeting the second-year 
Nashville Predators next Saturday at Columbus, Ga., in the first of 
eight exhibition games, the process of paring down the roster will 
begin. 
</P>
<P>
	Players will be returned to their junior teams in Canada or  
assigned to minor-league affiliates in Orlando and Greenville, S.C. 
</P>
<P>
	``Eight exhibition games is not a lot,'' Fraser said. ``But  
hopefully it will be enough for us to evaluate who we have and what 
they can do. By the end of camp, we will have found the best 23 
players to represent our team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The regular-season opener is Oct. 2 against the New Jersey  
Devils at Philips Arena.

<HEADLINE> Robber Takes Viagra From Pharmacy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORRANCE, Calif. (AP) -- An armed robber took $500 and two  
bottles of Viagra from a pharmacy. 
</P>
<P>
	The man walked into the Walgreen's Pharmacy, in this city south  
of downtown Los Angeles, on Friday and pulled a gun on three 
employees, demanding the money and the male anti-impotency drug, 
said Lt. Gil Kranke. 
</P>
<P>
	Each bottle contained 30 tablets. Each pill sells for about $10.  
</P>
<P>
	Police believe the robber, described as a young man in his 20s,  
was likely planning to sell the drugs on the black market rather 
than use them himself. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was pretty young to be needing something like that,''  
Kranke said.

<HEADLINE> Jagr Excited by New Penguins Owner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CANONSBURG, Pa. (AP) -- Star Jaromir Jagr showed up for the  
Pittsburgh Penguins training camp Saturday with a new look that 
found him shorn of his trademark curly, flowing hair. 
</P>
<P>
	Jagr, whose rock star-long hair was as much a part of his  
persona as his breakaway goals, surprised his teammates with his 
newly cut hair and new perspective on hockey. 
</P>
<P>
	The long hair was gone, and so was some of the immaturity that  
often was seen as the talented Jagr's only liability. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm older now,'' said Jagr, chosen as the NHL's best player  
last season after leading the Penguins to the second round of the 
playoffs. ``I was in Italy and I said, `Make me look Italian.' They 
have short hair like this. 
</P>
<P>
	``They definitely cut my hair.''  
</P>
<P>
	The Penguins could talk of nothing but Jagr's closely cropped  
hair and former teammate Mario Lemieux's close call. Lemieux 
finally completed his 10-month quest to extract the Penguins from 
bankruptcy by officially being approved as the new owner Friday, 
only hours before camp began. 
</P>
<P>
	Jagr expressed happiness with his new identity and his new boss,  
one who won his sixth NHL scoring title while playing alongside 
Jagr in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux's takeover signaled the start to a $1 million marketing  
campaign that is the Penguins' most ambitious -- and expensive -- in 
years. It features ads of Lemieux in his hockey gear and a business 
suit and is designed to pump up season ticket sales by 33 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Penguins sold nearly 100 new season-ticket plans only hours  
after Lemieux's takeover was approved in U.S. Bankruptcy Court 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's great for the city and it's great for the team,'' Jagr  
said. ``Everybody knows Mario Lemieux is a winner. He wants to win 
all of the time. We'll have a good attitude on this team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux did not show up Saturday, but plans to explain his  
takeover to the Penguins -- many of whom are former teammates -- next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's great to not have to worry about bankruptcy anymore, to  
not have to worry about our paychecks,'' Jagr said. ``We can 
concentrate on hockey now.''

<HEADLINE> Love Hewitt Ready for New Show </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Jennifer Love Hewitt knew her days on ``Party of  
Five'' were numbered. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was really upset and dealing with it internally. I thought,  
`What am I going to do when they say I'm fired?' Do I let myself 
cry?'' Hewitt says in the Sept. 10 issue of Entertainment Weekly. 
</P>
<P>
	``So I get there, my heart pounding, I sat down, like, `This is  
it -- I've done something bad.' And Chris (Keyser) and Amy (Lippman, 
show producers) were like, `We need to talk to you.' 
</P>
<P>
	``And I was like, `Oh, my God ...' And they're like, `We don't  
want Sarah to be on `Party of Five' anymore.' I was like, `OK, 
fine. I'll just pack up and leave.' And they were like, `No, we 
want her to go to New York on her own show.' 
</P>
<P>
	``And I was like, `I'm sorry -- could you repeat that 40 times so  
I can make sure I heard you correctly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So Hewitt, 20, is now ready for the autumn launch of her new  
show, ``Time of Your Life,'' in which her ``Party of Five'' 
character Sarah Reeves leaves San Francisco for the Big Apple. But 
the uncertainty accompanying her departure from one show on Fox 
followed her to the opening of another one. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still don't understand -- why me?'' she says. ``Why am I  
getting my own show?''

<HEADLINE> Holocaust Audit Reveals Many Holes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- A large-scale inspection of missing Holocaust-era  
assets in Swiss banks has turned up 62,000 accounts of uncertain 
ownership, 2,800 of which were matched with names of Holocaust 
victims, a Swiss newspaper reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ownership was impossible to determine in 45,000 of the accounts,  
while some 15,000 were thought to belong to Swiss citizens, the 
Geneva daily Le Temps said. 
</P>
<P>
	The report added that bankers were concerned the conclusions, if  
they covered undetermined accounts, could complicate a settlement 
made last year in which Switzerland's two largest commercial banks 
agreed to pay $1.25 billion to Holocaust survivors and their heirs 
for lost assets. 
</P>
<P>
	The banks, UBS AG and Credit Suisse, declined to comment on that  
possibility. 
</P>
<P>
	Le Temps said details of the sums the accounts contained were  
unavailable. 
</P>
<P>
	The inspection, in which auditors investigated millions of  
wartime bank accounts, ended in May. A final report from the 
commission overseeing it, headed by former U.S. Federal Reserve 
Chairman Paul Volcker, is expected in late November. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission, set up in May 1996, is made up of members  
appointed by Swiss banks and Jewish organizations and charged with 
looking at any unclaimed possession from the Nazi period. 
</P>
<P>
	The search was organized after complaints from Jewish  
organizations that, more than 50 years after World War II, the 
banks were still hiding assets deposited by Jews who were then 
killed by the Nazis. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, the Swiss Bankers Association published two lists  
containing some 16,500 account holders' names. 
</P>
<P>
	The association said this week it had no objection to publishing  
a third list. But spokeswoman Silvia Matile said it should be 
limited to accounts that have been firmly linked to the Holocaust.

<HEADLINE> Congress, Clinton Face Decisions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- So far, the budget debate between Congress and  
President Clinton has dealt with rival political priorities, 
setting positions for their annual showdown. Now it gets down to 
real money, with real deadlines. 
</P>
<P>
	When Congress reconvenes Wednesday after its summer vacation,  
there will be little more than three weeks to act on the 
appropriations bills due before budget new year on Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	There are White House veto warnings against Republican spending  
cuts in programs the president prizes. When it gets to him, Clinton 
is committed to veto the $792 billion GOP tax cut, which probably 
wouldn't have passed in the first place had wavering moderates not 
known when they voted for it that the measure would not become law. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House would like to get on with that, and chief of  
staff John Podesta said he hopes Republican leaders will send it to 
Clinton quickly now. 
</P>
<P>
	``Please send us the tax cut bill so that we don't have to keep  
fooling around with the phony debate,'' Podesta said. ``Send it 
down to us so that we can veto it and then move forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While a tax cut may eventually be part of a budget compromise  
later this fall, it doesn't have to be enacted. The 13 
appropriations bills, or substitute spending resolutions, do, to 
keep the government financed. 
</P>
<P>
	Only one, the least controversial, for military construction,  
has been passed and signed into law. The appropriation to pay for 
the operations of Congress is ready for Clinton's signature. 
</P>
<P>
	The other 11, appropriating at least $20 billion less than the  
president seeks, are unfinished business. Six have passed both the 
House and Senate and await negotiations on final terms. 
</P>
<P>
	While Republican leaders had aimed at completing them all before  
the end of the month -- a deadline that has been met only three 
times -- that's not likely. And any vetoed appropriation couldn't be 
revived by Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	So they'll pass what they can, and fall back as usual on  
resolutions to continue the spending authority of agencies that 
don't have their appropriations when the old ones expire. 
</P>
<P>
	That was done in 1998, before the administration and Republican  
leaders negotiated a catchall appropriation bill that included more 
than $20 billion in additional spending to seal the deal. 
Conservatives called that a sellout, but the alternative was 
gridlock and the risk of agency shutdowns like those of late 1995, 
episodes that hurt the Republicans politically. 
</P>
<P>
	Podesta said that at this point, the White House is not planning  
on a budget summit to work it all out in a package plan. But he 
said that ultimately, the administration and congressional leaders 
``are going to have to sit down and try to work through this 
problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They're all saying that whatever the settlement, it will be for  
a balanced budget. But that may involve some creative bookkeeping. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1997 budget deal set spending limits that pose a dilemma.  
</P>
<P>
	Neither party wants to openly suggest raising them. Both know  
that they can't be enforced without unacceptable cuts in popular 
federal programs. The hedge is to designate appropriations as 
emergency spending, which avoids the limit. 
</P>
<P>
	But it is all money, and it already is adding up to more than  
the $14 billion surplus projected for 2000, not counting Social 
Security, which Republicans have voted to lock away, not to be 
tapped for current spending. 
</P>
<P>
	So the numbers don't fit.  
</P>
<P>
	The Senate approved $7.4 billion in emergency farm aid before  
the recess, and Rep. Tom Delay, the Texan who is GOP whip, called 
that an atomic bomb that blows up House strategy for guarding 
Social Security surpluses. 
</P>
<P>
	But the House produced its own emergency gimmicks, notably on  
funds for the 2000 census. That's nearly $4.5 billion, for the 
census the Constitution requires, labeled an emergency although the 
rules reserve that designation for sudden, unforeseen and 
unpredictable needs. 
</P>
<P>
	The reason the census appropriation was declared an emergency is  
that the 1997 budget agreement didn't anticipate it. ``Someone 
forgot to tell the White House and the Congress in 1997 that we 
would face this,'' Rep. Harold Rogers, R-Ky., said before the House 
voted to uphold the designation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Apparently I now understand the nature of the emergency,''  
taunted Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass. ``We forgot.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	MARSEILLE, France (AP) -- Hundreds of angry farmers protesting  
American trade muscle and economic globalization bombarded riot 
police with apples on Saturday in this Mediterranean port city, the 
latest demonstration in two weeks of protests. 
</P>
<P>
	Security forces lobbed tear gas to stop the volley of apples  
thrown by 500 fruit and vegetable farmers armed with shopping carts 
from the Carrefour grocery store chain. 
</P>
<P>
	In a simultaneous protest, up to 200 protesting farmers, with  
cows, geese, pigs and a horses in tow, gathered in the Normandy 
town of Deauville, where the yearly American Film Festival was 
underway. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Americans came to help us 50 years ago,'' said Hilaire  
Taillecours, 62, from the Plateau du Neubourg in Normandy. ``But 
that doesn't mean they can tell us what to eat and how to film.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Taillecours raises cows and grows wheat and red beats on his  
125-acre farm. 
</P>
<P>
	His complaint reflected the expanding nature of the protest,  
which initially protested U.S. sanctions on a slew of products 
ranging from Roquefort cheese to foie gras. It has since expanded 
to include everything that symbolizes American ``hegemony'' in 
trade and agriculture, and globalization. 
</P>
<P>
	The protesters are all members of the radical agricultural  
union, the Farmers' Confederation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Globalization is creating absurd economic conflicts,'' the  
union said in an earlier statement. The aim of their protests is to 
``allow farmers and others to feed themselves as they think best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The farmers initially targeted McDonald's France as a symbol of  
globalization, landing union leader Jose Bove and four others in 
jail on Aug. 19 after a McDonald's construction site in the 
southern town of Millau was vandalized. 
</P>
<P>
	The imprisoned sheep farmer has quickly become a cause celebre  
of the movement, with offers from around France, and even from 
American farm groups, to pay his $17,000. McDonald's France dropped 
its damages claim against Bove, who refused a court offer to free 
him from jail last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Bove's lawyer, Francois Roux, said Friday that his client might  
go free by Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Doctor in Romanowski Scandal Probed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- The doctor accused of writing fraudulent  
prescriptions for a diet drug investigators say was used by Denver 
Broncos linebacker Bill Romanowski will be investigated by the 
Colorado Board of Medical Examiners. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Randall Snook of Littleton is accused of writing eight  
fraudulent prescriptions in the past year for the stimulant 
phentermine in the names of Romanowski's wife, Julie, and a friend, 
Lorretta Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	Douglas County sheriff's investigators have recommended felony  
criminal charges, including fraud and conspiracy, be filed against 
all four. 
</P>
<P>
	Snook also is under scrutiny by the state Board of Examiners.  
</P>
<P>
	``We've already initiated our investigation,'' Susan Miller, the  
medical board's administrator, said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The allegations resulted from a two-month investigation by the  
sheriff's department and the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration 
after federal officials received a tip. 
</P>
<P>
	Snook faces possible charges of fraud, unlawful dispensing of a  
controlled substance, conspiracy and unlawful acts. 
</P>
<P>
	The Romanowskis and Johnson face possible charges of fraud,  
deceit and conspiracy. Romanowski could also face a charge of 
unlawful use of a controlled substance. 
</P>
<P>
	Records show that Snook has been licensed to practice medicine  
in Colorado since July 1995. He never has been disciplined, and 
there are no restrictions on his license. 
</P>
<P>
	No arrests have been made, and no charges have been filed.  
</P>
<P>
	The Romanowskis' lawyer, Jeff Springer, has said they did  
nothing wrong. He also noted that the NFL doesn't ban phentermine. 
</P>
<P>
	The league, however, does mandate suspension without pay for a  
minimum of four regular-season or postseason games for abuse of 
prescription drugs. NFL officials declined to comment on the 
allegations against Romanowski. 
</P>
<P>
	The use of phentermine with fenfluramine, in a combination  
called ``fen-phen,'' has been linked to potentially fatal heart 
valve damage. A doctor said phentermine is prescribed for obesity, 
but can be used like the street drug ``speed,'' or methamphetamine. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the slightly weaker second cousin of methamphetamine,''  
said Dr. Jonathan Cole, a psychopharmacologist and Harvard 
University psychiatry professor. ``It's probably less likely to be 
abused than speed. But it could be abused.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Romanowski said he couldn't talk about the allegations when  
questioned by the media after the Broncos' 34-3 victory over San 
Francisco Friday night.

<HEADLINE> Love Hewitt Ready for New Show </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Jennifer Love Hewitt knew her days on ``Party of  
Five'' were numbered. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was really upset and dealing with it internally. I thought,  
`What am I going to do when they say I'm fired?' Do I let myself 
cry?'' Hewitt says in the Sept. 10 issue of Entertainment Weekly. 
</P>
<P>
	``So I get there, my heart pounding, I sat down, like, `This is  
it -- I've done something bad.' And Chris (Keyser) and Amy (Lippman, 
show producers) were like, `We need to talk to you.' 
</P>
<P>
	``And I was like, `Oh, my God ...' And they're like, `We don't  
want Sarah to be on `Party of Five' anymore.' I was like, `OK, 
fine. I'll just pack up and leave.' And they were like, `No, we 
want her to go to New York on her own show.' 
</P>
<P>
	``And I was like, `I'm sorry -- could you repeat that 40 times so  
I can make sure I heard you correctly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So Hewitt, 20, is now ready for the autumn launch of her new  
show, ``Time of Your Life,'' in which her ``Party of Five'' 
character Sarah Reeves leaves San Francisco for the Big Apple. But 
the uncertainty accompanying her departure from one show on Fox 
followed her to the opening of another one. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still don't understand -- why me?'' she says. ``Why am I  
getting my own show?''

<HEADLINE> 3 Nabbed for Scaling Wash. Monument </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Three animal rights activists were arrested  
Saturday after they climbed part-way up scaffolding surrounding the 
Washington Monument, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	They were identified as Leslie Pickering, Jonathon Batchelor and  
Michael Brassell, all from the Washington area. They were 
protesting primate research, Park Police spokesman Lt. Dave 
Mulholland said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mulholland said they were charged with unlawful entry, a  
misdemeanor, and a felony charge of resisting arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	They will be held in a District of Columbia jail until Tuesday,  
when they are scheduled to appear in court, Mulholland said. 
</P>
<P>
	The three belong to a group called the Coalition to Stop Primate  
Experimentation, which obtained a permit to protest on the monument 
grounds, Mulholland said. The group estimated 200 people showed up 
for the protest; park police did not give an estimate. 
</P>
<P>
	Group member Rick Bogle said the three men unfurled a banner  
while they were hanging from the scaffolding that criticized the 
National Institutes of Health for funding labs that perform medical 
tests on primates. 
</P>
<P>
	Activists said Saturday's event marked the end of a  
cross-country bus tour that began in Seattle on July 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Mulholland said park police would be reviewing security at the  
monument to see what could be done to prevent similar incidents in 
the future. 
</P>
<P>
	The monument is undergoing a $9.6 million repair job. Architect  
Michael Graves designed the scaffolding that is to remain attached 
to the monument through the middle of next year.

<HEADLINE> Peace a Challenge in Kosovo Village </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GORNJI LIVOC, Yugoslavia (AP) -- In this Kosovo village, the  
Golden Gate bridge spans the Mississippi, schoolchildren attend 
West Point and Serbs and ethnic Albanians alike smile and wave when 
U.S. soldiers pass by. 
</P>
<P>
	Even beyond the fantasy names for local landmarks, this isn't  
your average Kosovo village. As far as Lt. James Taumoepeau and his 
platoon are concerned, it's Camelot. And they are pulling off 
something here not even Merlin could achieve -- getting Serbs and 
ethnic Albanians to live together in peace. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're not talking yet,'' Taumoepeau says. ``But nobody has  
fired a shot since we arrived and they're not at each others' 
throats anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't always like this. When Taumoepeau and the men of Bravo  
Company, 1st Batallion, 77th Armored Regiment, 2nd Platoon -- they 
call themselves ``The Bonecrushers'' -- rode their four tanks into 
town about five weeks ago, they found a Serb farmer and an ethnic 
Albanian farmer at an intersection, voices raised and fists balled, 
fighting over a combine tractor. The Serb wanted his wheat 
harvested. The ethnic Albanian refused. 
</P>
<P>
	``It took me 43 minutes to calm them down,'' says Taumoepeau,  
known by the locals simply as Lt. James. ``But at the end, I had 
them shaking hands about to kiss. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told the (Serb) guy my problem is your problem,'' says  
Taumoepeau, 24, of San Mateo, Calif. He says he got a Serb from 
another village to bring over his combine and harvest the Serb's 
wheat. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, members of the platoon have called the intersection  
where the confrontation took place the ``O.K. Corral.'' And the 
ethnically motivated conflicts -- from near daily mortar and gun 
attacks, to the burning of houses -- have stopped. 
</P>
<P>
	``From the day they came to town it's quiet,'' said Slavko  
Arsic, who represents the town's 160 Serbs. ``We are very satisfied 
with what they have done -- everything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This includes not only getting the village's roughly 1,700  
Albanians to live peacefully with the Serbs, but also speeding up 
deliveries of badly needed food aid for both sides, helping apply 
for international aid to improve the village's availability of 
electricity and organizing a cleanup of the village stream, which 
the Bonecrushers call ``The Mississippi.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They cooperate with both sides, and they talk with both sides  
to make things better,'' said Sabit Lekaj, director of the local 
school. 
</P>
<P>
	The soldiers are among the approximately 40,000 troops of the  
NATO-led peacekeeping force in Kosovo, and their fame has spread as 
far away as Belgrade, where the usually anti-American Serb media 
recently praised Lt. James for taking charge of security and 
improving life. 
</P>
<P>
	``He took the U.N. mandate seriously, he is fair to the people  
in the village, regardless of ethnicity and wants to help both 
Serbs and Albanians,'' the independent Danas daily said in an 
article last week. 
</P>
<P>
	The platoon's hands-on, open-minded approach often strays from  
standard army procedure. But their success in turning this former 
hotspot into a place where Serbs who had fled feel safe enough to 
return has earned the soldiers a reputation as the top platoon of 
the U.S.-patrolled sector in eastern Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think of ourselves as knights,'' says Taumoepeau, with a  
smile. ``And this is Camelot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A map of this village about 30 miles east of Pristina hangs on a  
wall of the soldier's brick house, which serves as their 
headquarters. The hand-drawn map reflects their creativity. Four 
small bridges spanning the village stream carry the names of 
would-famous structures -- such as the Golden Gate -- and the two 
village shops have been dubbed the ``Circle K'' and the 
``7-Eleven.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Taumoepeau tries to downplay his personal role, his men  
acknowledge he is special. Not only has he learned the intricacies 
of ethnic Albanian politics and the Serb history of the battle of 
Kosovo, but he knows most villagers by name. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a godsend,'' says Sgt. Michael Stevens of Hernando, Fla.  
The mention of Taumoepeau's name can scare away unruly kids in the 
village, Stevens said. ``Whenever they are messing with us, we just 
say, 'hey, James is over there,' and they run off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The platoon's next goal is to get the village's four Serb  
children back to school, a project that has required many visits to 
local leaders and the Serb teacher, to work out a security plan and 
how he will be paid. 
</P>
<P>
	With the situation in Gornji Livoc stabilized, U.S. officers are  
threatening to move the Bonecrushers to work their magic in another 
ethnically tense village -- a prospect nobody here wants to think 
about. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they hadn't come, we'd all be dead,'' says Hafiz Kurteshi,  
an ethnic Albanian who says he considers Taumoepeau a brother. 
``And if they go, there will be problems again... We'll have to go 
with them.''

<HEADLINE> Holocaust Audit Reveals Many Holes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- A large-scale inspection of missing Holocaust-era  
assets in Swiss banks has turned up 62,000 accounts of uncertain 
ownership, 2,800 of which were matched with names of Holocaust 
victims, a Swiss newspaper reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ownership was impossible to determine in 45,000 of the accounts,  
while some 15,000 were thought to belong to Swiss citizens, the 
Geneva daily Le Temps said. 
</P>
<P>
	The report added that bankers were concerned the conclusions, if  
they covered undetermined accounts, could complicate a settlement 
made last year in which Switzerland's two largest commercial banks 
agreed to pay $1.25 billion to Holocaust survivors and their heirs 
for lost assets. 
</P>
<P>
	The banks, UBS AG and Credit Suisse, declined to comment on that  
possibility. 
</P>
<P>
	Le Temps said details of the sums the accounts contained were  
unavailable. 
</P>
<P>
	The inspection, in which auditors investigated millions of  
wartime bank accounts, ended in May. A final report from the 
commission overseeing it, headed by former U.S. Federal Reserve 
Chairman Paul Volcker, is expected in late November. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission, set up in May 1996, is made up of members  
appointed by Swiss banks and Jewish organizations and charged with 
looking at any unclaimed possession from the Nazi period. 
</P>
<P>
	The search was organized after complaints from Jewish  
organizations that, more than 50 years after World War II, the 
banks were still hiding assets deposited by Jews who were then 
killed by the Nazis. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, the Swiss Bankers Association published two lists  
containing some 16,500 account holders' names. 
</P>
<P>
	The association said this week it had no objection to publishing  
a third list. But spokeswoman Silvia Matile said it should be 
limited to accounts that have been firmly linked to the Holocaust.

<HEADLINE> Dolphins Sign Webb for One Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAVIE, Fla. (AP) -- Tackle Richmond Webb conceded defeat in his  
contract dispute with the Miami Dolphins and accepted an offer the 
team made in February. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven-time Pro Bowl tackle reported for practice Saturday  
after accepting a one-year, $3.45 million tender. 
</P>
<P>
	Webb had wanted a long-term contract up to $6 million per year,  
but he had limited leverage because the Dolphins designated him 
their franchise player last winter. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Jimmy Johnson declined to characterize Webb's decision to  
report as a victory for management. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a very good player, and he's going to make a lot of  
money,'' Johnson said. ``We'll continue to talk about a long-term 
contract.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Sunday's regular-season roster deadline approaching, the  
Dolphins traded defensive tackle Barron Tanner to the Washington 
Redskins for an undisclosed draft choice. Miami waived five players 
-- linebacker Jimmy Clements, guard Derrick LeVake, tackle Thomas 
Rayam, fullback Jamie Reader and tackle Barry Stokes. 
</P>
<P>
	The moves reduced the roster to 64 players, 11 above the  
regular-season limit. 
</P>
<P>
	In Webb's absence, Brent Smith started at left tackle during the  
preseason and won raves from Johnson. The coach declined to predict 
whether Webb would start the season-opener Sept. 13 at Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no idea on his conditioning,'' Johnson said. ``We'll  
just have to wait and see. If Richmond is able to show he's ready 
to step back in, then we'll go that direction. But I'm very 
comfortable either way. If Richmond's not ready, Brent can handle 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Webb said he wasn't bitter about settling for the one-year deal.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is a business, and you have to understand that going into  
it,'' he said. ``There are no hard feelings. I'm glad to be here, 
and I'll try to get ready as soon as I can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was a bright side for Webb -- at least he missed training  
camp. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was about to go crazy because I missed all that hitting and  
those two-a-days,'' he said, jokingly. ``I told them to ship my 
pads to me.''

<HEADLINE> Picking All-Century Team Isn't Easy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	When major league baseball and its marketing partners began  
their Team of the Century promotion, it seemed like a dandy idea. 
</P>
<P>
	Then the ballot arrived, crammed with 100 of the greatest  
players in history, all of whom are or should be in the Hall of 
Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	The challenge: Pick a 25-man roster.  
</P>
<P>
	The question: Who gets left out?  
</P>
<P>
	As if pennant races and wild card chases aren't tough enough,  
now baseball wants fans to separate Cochrane from Bench, Cobb from 
Mays, Ruth from Aaron. 
</P>
<P>
	This is like picking between a Model-T Ford and a Lexus LS 400.  
Each is special in its own time. 
</P>
<P>
	A better idea, certainly a more equitable one, might be to  
divide the century in half, to let players compete against those of 
their own era. 
</P>
<P>
	``I totally agree with that,'' said Ernie Banks, a candidate at  
shortstop. ``They're different times, different eras. We shouldn't 
all be lumped together. It's different generations of the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Banks' situation is typical. He is sandwiched at shortstop  
between old-timers Joe Cronin and Honus Wagner and moderns Ozzie 
Smith and Cal Ripken Jr. In his time, Banks was the best in the 
business with 512 home runs. But his time was not the same as that 
of those other players. 
</P>
<P>
	``The game has changed so much,'' he said. ``It's different  
technology, different balls. It's a different world. It's not that 
one generation is better than the other. It's just that one is 
different from the other.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then there is the issue of the voters. Most people casting  
ballots on the Internet never saw Wagner or Cronin play and might 
not have seen Banks. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's why I wear a cap with my name on it,'' Mr. Cub said.  
</P>
<P>
	The half-century solution wouldn't help much at third base where  
the ballot lists six candidates, old-timer Pie Traynor and moderns 
George Brett, Paul Molitor, Eddie Mathews, Mike Schmidt and Brooks 
Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
	Put Traynor in the early era team. Now whom do you vote for?  
Like a 3,000-hit guy? Which one, Brett or Molitor? Prefer 500 home 
runs? Which one, Schmidt or Mathews? Defense? Robinson won 16 Gold 
Gloves. 
</P>
<P>
	What do you do?  
</P>
<P>
	``You tell me,'' Brett said. ``It's a dilemma. It's like the  
All-Star balloting every year. Is there a right way? I doubt it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What Brett knows is the moderns have an edge.  
</P>
<P>
	``I heard about Pie Traynor but I never saw him,'' he said.  
``You remember what you see more than what you hear.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The All-Century promotion allows voters to pick six pitchers -- a  
slim staff in view of the current five-man rotation. Start with Cy 
Young and his 511 victories and Nolan Ryan with his seven 
no-hitters and 5,714 strikeouts. Then supplement them with, oh, 
perhaps Christy Mathewson, who won 20 or more games 13 times, and 
Walter Johnson, a 416-game winner. 
</P>
<P>
	Careful, now. That's four of six and no left-handers, yet.  
Voters are asked to pick at least one southpaw. So, which one? 
Warren Spahn with 363 victories or Sandy Koufax with three 
no-hitters and an 0.95 ERA in 57 World Series innings? Carl Hubbell 
with five straight 20-win seasons or Lefty Grove, a 300-game 
winner? 
</P>
<P>
	Want all four? No good. That would make eight pitchers, two over  
the limit. And it doesn't even account for worthy candidates like 
Tom Seaver and Dizzy Dean -- and in case you're looking for a relief 
pitcher -- Rollie Fingers or Dennis Eckersley. 
</P>
<P>
	Outfielders might be the toughest department. They allow nine.  
Twice that might not be enough. 
</P>
<P>
	If you start with Aaron and his 755 home runs in right field,  
does that mean leaving out Ruth and his 714? If you want Cobb and 
his 4,191 hits in center field, what about Mays and his 660 homers? 
Prefer Ted Williams, the last .400 hitter in left? Then what about 
Lou Brock and his 3,023 hits and 938 stolen bases? 
</P>
<P>
	Take all six and there are just three places left to pick from  
the likes of Joe DiMaggio, Mickey Mantle, Shoeless Joe Jackson, 
Hack Wilson, Joe Medwick and Carl Yastrzemski. 
</P>
<P>
	You get just three of them and look who's still left out.  
</P>
<P>
	No room for Clemente?  
</P>
<P>
	What about Musial and Speaker and Junior Griffey?  
</P>
<P>
	And by the way, there is this fellow named Rose, who had more  
hits than any of them. 
</P>
<P>
	So, it's clear this task is impossible. There is a simple  
solution, though. The dividing line should be uniforms -- flannels 
vs. flannels and double knits vs. double knits. Pick a pair of 
teams, one from then, one from now. 
</P>
<P>
	``And then,'' Banks said, ``let's play two.''

<HEADLINE> Jailed Cuba Foe Ends Hunger Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAVANA (AP) -- Jailed opposition leader Marta Beatriz Roque ended  
a hunger strike Saturday, pledging to resume it if she doesn't soon 
get a response to a sentencing appeal, a colleague said. 
</P>
<P>
	``She is now talking, she is drinking water, she is eating,''  
Ileana Someillan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Roque was hospitalized for much of the liquids-only fast that  
she began on July 16. She began a complete hunger strike on 
Thursday. Someillan said she suffered from severe gastrointestinal 
problems and recently had begun fainting frequently. 
</P>
<P>
	After meeting with government security agents, Roque agreed to  
lift the hunger protest. Roque will remain in the jail's hospital 
until she's well enough to return to a regular jail. 
</P>
<P>
	Roque and three other leading political opponents of the Castro  
regime were arrested in July 1997 for criticizing a Communist Party 
document. They also were accused of encouraging Cubans not to vote 
in 1997 elections, exhorting foreign businessmen not to invest in 
Cuba and asking Cuban exiles to encourage their kin on the island 
to engage in acts of civil disobedience. 
</P>
<P>
	After a closed-door trial that drew international criticism and  
calls for their release, the four were convicted and sentenced in 
March. 
</P>
<P>
	Roque, an economist, was ordered to serve 3 1/2 years in prison.  
Lawyer Rene Gomez Manzano and engineer Felix Bonne were given four 
years each. Vladirimo Roca, a former military fighter pilot and son 
of a revered Communist Party leader, was sentenced to five years. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling damaged relations that Cuba has worked to improve  
with other nations, particularly in the Caribbean and Latin 
America. The United States, Canada, the Vatican and several 
European nations have urged Cuba to free the four dissidents. 
</P>
<P>
	Several heads of state -- including those of Argentina and Chile  
-- have announced that they would not attend the Ibero American 
summit, to be held in Havana in mid-November, in part because of 
Cuba's human rights record. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuban officials insist there are no political prisoners on this  
island nation of 11 million people, only those jailed for common 
crimes. They reject the characterization of the four dissidents as 
prisoners of conscience.

<HEADLINE> `Widows Win' Theory Meets Challenge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In the history of special elections for House  
seats, ``widows win'' is a familiar refrain. They usually do, 
regardless of political party. 
</P>
<P>
	Most recently, Republican Rep. Jo Ann Emerson of Missouri won a  
special election in 1996 to succeed her late husband. So, too, GOP 
Rep. Mary Bono and Democratic Rep. Lois Capps, both in California, 
and both in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	So ordinarily Democrats might have been delighted when Marta  
Macias Brown announced she would attempt to succeed her husband, 
Rep. George Brown of California, who died in July. ``Who better to 
replace him than the person who worked side by side with him over 
the last 19 years?'' the 54-year-old Brown said as she announced 
her candidacy for the Sept. 21 balloting in the area around San 
Bernardino. 
</P>
<P>
	But Mrs. Brown immediately encountered political turbulence that  
other widows don't have to contend with. 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, say  
Mrs. Brown appealed to Democratic Leader Richard Gephardt several 
weeks ago to help clear the field for her. He declined. 
</P>
<P>
	Other Democratic contenders are in the race, including a veteran  
state lawmaker, Sen. Joe Baca. He has a solid political base in the 
district, and bowed to the wishes of party officials two years ago 
who asked him not to mount a primary challenge to Brown. 
</P>
<P>
	In declaring his candidacy, he sought to position himself as  
Brown's heir. ``In the Legislature, I have tried to live what 
Congressman Brown believed,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	--------	 
</P>
<P>
	Ordinarily, the potential for a primary might be giving  
Democrats a bad case of heartburn. 
</P>
<P>
	But Republicans have had recruiting problems of a different sort  
in the district. To their unhappiness, state Sen. Jim Brulte 
recently declined to make the race. Ditto Linda Wilde, who narrowly 
lost to Brown in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	That left Elia Pirozzi, who drew only 40 percent of the vote  
against Brown in 1998, among others. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the Democrats' (seat) to lose,'' says Jill Schroeder,  
spokeswoman for the GOP. And recruiting disappointments aside, on 
voting patterns alone, she's correct. Brown was elected several 
times, President Clinton won the district in 1996 and Sen. Barbara 
Boxer and Gov. Gray Davis both ran well there in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The special House election will be held Sept. 21. If no  
candidate gains a majority, the top vote getter in each party will 
run in a general election in November. 
</P>
<P>
	--------	 

</P>
<P>
	Republicans have suffered one other recent high profile setback  
in their efforts to fortify their narrow majority in the House, 
which now stands at 222, to 211 Democrats, one independent and the 
vacant Brown seat. 
</P>
<P>
	In Michigan, Secretary of State Candice Miller decided not to  
challenge House Democratic Whip David Bonior. Her decision 
surprised GOP campaign strategists who had boasted to reporters 
that Bonior was target No. 1 in 2000, and touted Miller's candidacy 
on their Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	In Montana, Republican Rep. Rick Hill's decision to retire after  
two terms because of health concerns creates an open seat the GOP 
had not expected to have to defend. Nancy Keenan, state 
superintendent of public instruction, is seeking the Democratic 
nomination. The GOP is hoping former Lt. Gov. Dennis Rehberg will 
make the race. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other side of the ledger, strategists in both sides  
expect Republican Rep. Rick Lazio of New York to seek re-election, 
meaning his seat will be safe for the GOP. Lazio had been looking 
to run for the Senate, but those plans are on hold. 
</P>
<P>
	--------	 

</P>
<P>
	Hill's departure brings the number of House retirements thus far  
to 19, 13 of them Republicans and only six Democrats. Most of those 
seats should be easily held by the party that currently occupies 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	But the tiny number of competitive Democratic open seats thus  
far -- only two or three -- means the GOP has few opportunities to 
offset any losses suffered by their own incumbents next year. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, 31 Democrats retired voluntarily and only 22  
Republicans, and the GOP was able to make up for some of its 
incumbent defeats by grabbing seats previously held by Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, retirements split evenly, 17 for each party. Democrats  
won 18 of them en route to whittling away the GOP majority.

<HEADLINE> Blissfull Hall Wins Cane Pace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FREEHOLD, N.J. (AP) -- Blissfull Hall led almost the entire race  
and easily captured the $377,934 Cane Pace at Freehold on Saturday 
as heavily favored The Panderosa went off stride and finished last 
in the opening leg of pacing's Triple Crown. 
</P>
<P>
	Driven by Ron Pierce, Blissfull Hall set a track record for  
3-year-olds, covering the mile in 1:51.4. That was a fifth of a 
second faster than the mark set by The Panderosa in last weekend's 
eliminations for this race. 
</P>
<P>
	Blissfull Hall finished 2 1/4 lengths ahead of runner-up Heartbeat  
Mindale in winning for the sixth time in nine starts this year. The 
Ben Wallace-trained colt paid $6.80, $5.20 and $4.40 and earned 
$188,967. 
</P>
<P>
	The owners of Blissfull Hall had to pay $35,000 to supplement  
the colt to the Cane. The colt is eligible for the Little Brown 
Jug, the second leg of the triple crown, in Ohio later this month, 
but he would also have to be supplemented to The Messenger, the 
final leg at Ladbroke at the Meadows, next month. 
</P>
<P>
	Heartbeat Mindale, who was driven by Jack Moiseyev, paid $6.80  
and $7.20, while Soulofthematter, who was driven by Jim Doherty, 
was $15.20 to show. 
</P>
<P>
	Blissfull Hall and The Panderosa won their eliminations for this  
race last weekend and many expected the two to put on a great show 
in the final. 
</P>
<P>
	It never happened.  
</P>
<P>
	Pierce put Blissfull Hall on the lead right from the start out  
of the No. 3 post position and the pair stayed there most of the 
way. 
</P>
<P>
	The Panderosa, who won the $1 million Meadowlands Pace, had  
started from the No. 7 post with driver John Campbell. As the field 
entered the clubhouse turn leading to the backstretch for a second 
time on the half-mile track, The Panderosa seemed to jump and went 
offstride while racing in sixth place. The colt never recovered and 
finished last. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only thing I can say is that he put in a little step and  
made a break,'' said Campbell, who won the Meadowlands Pace from 
the No. 10 post. ``I was surprised that it happened since he was 
fine to that point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pierce said he didn't plan to go right to the lead but he opted  
to do that when he saw Campbell hustling The Panderosa from the 
outside. 
</P>
<P>
	``He felt awfully good once he got to the top,'' Pierce said.  
``He took a good grip and he was just begging me to let him 
loose.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Women's Soccer 5, Ireland 0 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FOXBORO, Mass. (AP) -- There was no world championship at stake.  
The stadium was only half-full. None of the players took off her 
shirt. 
</P>
<P>
	Sill, it was a successful reunion for the U.S. women's soccer  
team on Saturday when the players got together for the first time 
since their World Cup victory and beat Ireland 5-0. 
</P>
<P>
	Tiffeny Milbrett had two goals and an assist for the United  
States, which shook off the rust of a well-earned rest to begin its 
tuneup for the Sydney Olympics. Julie Foudy, Joy Fawcett and 
Kristine Lilly also scored for the Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. women became national celebrities after beating China  
in a World Cup final shootout in front of 90,185 at the Rose Bowl 
in Pasadena, Calif., and a domestic television audience estimated 
at 40 million. Since then, the players have been showered with 
autograph requests, endorsement contracts and cereal box covers. 
</P>
<P>
	But the first real proof that the interest would be sustained  
beyond the World Cup euphoria may have come Saturday, in a stadium 
and an atmosphere quite different than the summer's. 
</P>
<P>
	A crowd of 30,564, many of them young girls in Mia Hamm and  
Brandi Chastain jerseys, half filled Foxboro Stadium. In contrast, 
the New England Revolution of Major League Soccer, who played the 
Tampa Bay Mutiny in the second half of the doubleheader, draw about 
17,000 per game. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States held just a 3-2 advantage in shots on goal  
through 25 minutes before moving into another gear, outshooting the 
Irish 13-0 over the rest of the half to take a 2-0 lead at the 
break. 
</P>
<P>
	Milbrett chased down a lob pass from Cindy Parlow and put it  
over Ireland keeper Emma Bryne's head to make it 1-0. The U.S. team 
scored again in the 38th minute when Milbrett gave Foudy a perfect 
pass and she redirected it past Byrne for a 2-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 59th minute, Sara Whalen brought the ball down the right  
side and crossed it to Milbrett for her second goal of the game and 
the 64th of her career. Fawcett made it 4-0 in the 71st minute, and 
Lilly made it 5-0 in the 75th minute.

<HEADLINE> Carolina Gets Hurricane Warning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NAGS HEAD, N.C. (AP) -- Hurricane warnings were posted for much  
of the already battered North Carolina coast today as Tropical 
Storm Dennis strengthened slightly and headed for land. 
</P>
<P>
	After meandering along the coast for a week, Dennis was expected  
to finally come ashore tonight near Morehead City, with a chance it 
might build up to hurricane strength, meteorologists said today. 
</P>
<P>
	People along the shore were keeping a watch on the returning  
storm, said commercial fisherman Jonathan Robinson in the tiny 
fishing village of Stacy, northeast of Morehead City. 
</P>
<P>
	``We put our boats in the harbor down here last Saturday and we  
ain't got 'em out yet,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Along with heavy surf that has damaged beaches and dunes, the  
storm has ruined the holiday weekend tourist trade. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not the Labor Day weekend we'd hoped for,'' Keith  
Brightbell said Friday from his shirt shop here. ``Business was so 
good in June because of the lighthouse move, it balanced out the 
loss of Labor Day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of tourists had been drawn to the Outer Banks this  
summer to see the Cape Hatteras Lighthouse being moved a half mile 
from the beach to protect it from erosion. 
</P>
<P>
	Last weekend, then-Hurricane Dennis sideswiped the coast without  
ever coming ashore. It dumped up to 8 inches of rain and dished out 
20-foot waves and 100 mph wind before heading out to sea. But it 
soon began backtracking. 
</P>
<P>
	At 11 a.m. EDT today, the storm was centered about 80 miles  
south of Cape Hatteras, and its top sustained wind had accelerated 
to 65 mph, the National Weather Service said. There was a chance it 
could grow back up to hurricane strength of at least 74 mph before 
hitting land. It was moving northwest at about 9 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	A hurricane warning was in effect along much of the North  
Carolina coast from the Virginia state line to Surf City, and a 
tropical storm warning extended northward along the Virginia coast 
to Chincoteague. 
</P>
<P>
	Vacationers and residents alike are tired of the 11-day-old  
storm. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just want to go home,'' said Pete Wilcox, as he sat at a  
roadblock in Nags Head on Friday, trying to reach his home in 
Rodanthe, on Hatteras Island. ``I've been out of work a week, and 
don't need that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the island, where surf chewed up the main north-south highway  
and choked it with sand, four-wheel-drive traffic was allowed again 
Friday. A half-mile of the roadway remains impassable north of 
Buxton, where the lighthouse is located. 
</P>
<P>
	Few motels and campgrounds, normally teeming this weekend, were  
open at midday Friday. Many of the thousands of vacationers who 
pack the Outer Banks in summer were gone, and traffic was light on 
area roads. 
</P>
<P>
	``Normally we would be full for all three days,'' said Nancy  
Newins, manager of Lucille's Motel in Carolina Beach, where fewer 
than half the rooms were booked. ``We're hoping the storm goes 
away, and everybody sees it on the news and hurries back.''

<HEADLINE> Galaxy 2, Fusion 1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- Cobi Jones' goal early in the  
second half gave the Los Angeles Galaxy a 2-1 victory over the 
Miami Fusion on Saturday night in the MLS. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones ran through the middle of Miami's defense and picked up a  
perfectly timed pass from Mauricio Cienfuegos. Jones caught up with 
Cienfuegos' pass, heading in a six-yard shot past Fusion goalkeeper 
Garth Lagerwey to snap a 1-1 tie. 
</P>
<P>
	The goal was Jones' sixth of the season.  
</P>
<P>
	The Galaxy didn't allow the Fusion to mount repeated scoring  
opportunities during the rest of the match. Saul Martinez's 
deflected shot -- quickly stopped by Los Angeles goalkeeper Kevin 
Hartman in the final minute -- was Miami's last chance at tying the 
match. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory was Los Angeles' sixth in its last seven matches.  
The Galaxy (17-9, 45 points) now lead the Western Division after 
Colorado's 2-1 loss to Columbus on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami (10-17, 22 points) remains fourth in the Eastern Division.  
</P>
<P>
	The loss spoiled the Fusion debut of former U.S. national team  
member Eric Wynalda. Acquired from San Jose on July 1, Wynalda was 
sidelined since last September with torn knee ligaments. 
</P>
<P>
	Wynalda had one scoring chance late in the match, but his header  
from 18 yards sailed wide. 
</P>
<P>
	The Galaxy opened the scoring in the 10th minute, when Danny  
Pena converted on a header off a corner kick from Greg Vanney for 
his second goal of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles headed in another shot in the 27th minute -- but at  
its own goal. Ezra Hendrickson, trying to clear a Fusion indirect 
kick by Henry Gutierrez, tied the match instead. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami nearly missed taking the lead late in the first half, when  
Jay Heaps' header wasn't cleared deep in the Galaxy goal. But 
goalkeeper Kevin Hartman pounced on the ball, blocking the Fusion's 
Welton from getting a clear shot.

<HEADLINE> Franchitti, Tracy Good Racing Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- Dario Franchitti gives  
teammate Paul Tracy considerable credit for his rise to stardom in 
the CART FedEx Series. 
</P>
<P>
	``Teammwork is very important for us,'' Franchitti said Friday  
after taking the provisional pole for the Vancouver Molson Indy. 
``We share information and set-ups. Everything on our two teams is 
an open book.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tracy, who qualified second to Franchitti on Friday, only to  
have his time disallowed when a routine inspection found his car 
was lower than the allowable 2 inches, emphasized the Team Kool 
Green drivers have helped each other considerably in their second 
year together. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're pretty close together right now,'' said Tracy, who gets  
another chance to qualify in today's final round of time trials. 
``The set-ups on our cars are pretty close and the performance on 
the track is pretty close.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Franchitti said, ``We're both working at a high level right now.  
We're getting good feedback from each other and also being very 
competitive with each other. We're both out to be the guy up 
front.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, it was Franchitti, a 26-year-old Scotsman, who was  
out front with a fast lap of 104.520 mph on the reconfigured 
1.781-mile, 12-turn course at the edge of downtown Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
	Tracy was closest at 104.102 before his speed was disallowed.  
</P>
<P>
	Franchitti, who trails series leader Juan Montoya by four points  
in the standings, got the job done Friday in only eight laps. He 
turned his fast time on his final trip around the circuit, which 
now features an uninterrupted back straightaway and wider, more 
open turns at the tightest part of the course. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, the new track configuration is already considerably  
faster than last year's 1.802-mile version on which Franchitti won 
the race from the pole after qualifying at a then-record 101.147. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today, I was just trying to get used to the track and the  
changes they made,'' said Franchitti, who was conserving tires for 
the race. ``We're definitely looking for improvements tomorrow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for those track changes, he said, ``The wall being farther  
away, from a safety standpoint, is very good. It's faster and I 
think it's better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked why he and Franchitti are so good on the temporary  
circuits, Tracy shrugged and said, ``I don't really know why we're 
particularly strong on the street courses. They're not places we 
can test and we really haven't tested that much on road courses, 
either. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I think last year we just got a good baseline.''  
</P>
<P>
	Roberto Moreno, continuing to sub for injured Christian  
Fittipaldi, moved up to the second qualifying spot at 103.997, 
followed by local favorite Greg Moore, from suburban Maple Ridge, 
at 103.889, Gil de Ferran at 103.867 and rookie Montoya at 103.801. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year's track layout -- which was completely new because of  
continuing construction at Concord Pacific Place, where the race is 
held -- was criticized by nearly every driver for being too bumpy, 
too slow, too narrow in critical places and lacking enough safe 
runoff areas. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was just no margin for error,'' said Scott Pruett, head  
of the CART drivers' safety committee. ``If you put one wrong 
wheel, you were finished.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year's problems have all been addressed in the latest  
version of the course, which got passing marks from the drivers. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's improvement at both ends,'' Tracy said. ``I think  
they've done everything they can do with the land available to 
them.''

<HEADLINE> Comets Heavily Favored To Three-Peat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Just because the Houston Comets are on the brink  
of their third championship in the WNBA's third season doesn't mean 
coach Van Chancellor has suddenly become an optimist. 
</P>
<P>
	Overconfidence ``was one of my greatest concerns coming into  
today's practice,'' Chancellor said Friday. ``When I left New York 
this morning, needless to say I came in here and kind of got after 
them, but they had just great focus. 
</P>
<P>
	``In three years, I have to say there have not been many times  
they have come in here and been overconfident.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As the Comets head into what could be a deciding second game of  
their best-of-3 series with the New York Liberty on Saturday, they 
seem to have every reason in the world to expect a victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston is 34-2 at home the last two seasons and has never lost  
a playoff game on its home court. 
</P>
<P>
	In Thursday's 73-60 victory in Game 1, the Comets' top-rated  
defense held New York to just 26 percent shooting in the first 
half. Cynthia Cooper, meanwhile, took care of the offense. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, she's at the top of her game right now,'' Liberty  
coach Richie Adubato said of Cooper, who matched her championship 
record with 29 points Thursday while holding New York star Teresa 
Weatherspoon to 5. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite overwhelming odds in their favor, Cooper vowed to take  
nothing for granted. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know they're not going to come in and just lie down,''  
Cooper cautioned. 
</P>
<P>
	Weatherspoon seconded that.  
</P>
<P>
	``They're supposed to throw everything at you,'' she said of the  
Comets' defensive onslaught. ``We're trying to do the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not coming in with our heads down. We just want to prove  
some things to ourselves, and not anyone else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As Adubato spoke to reporters Friday, WNBA officials handed out  
a news release announcing the veteran coach was fined $1,500 for 
criticizing the officials Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sept. 2 was my wife's birthday. I guess she's not getting  
jewelry this year,'' he said.

<P>
	BIG BEAR LAKE, Calif. (AP) -- Firefighters gouged a 90-mile  
fireline Saturday to pen in a blaze that threatened to devour 
forests and homes across the San Bernardino Mountains east of Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	The 63,486-acre Willow blaze -- the largest remaining wildfire  
among dozens that have scarred thousands of acres across the 
western United States since July -- was 100 percent contained, 
thanks to the backbreaking work of some 2,700 firefighters who 
traveled from across the country to push back the flames. 
</P>
<P>
	The Willow blaze had crept toward several small resort  
communities during the week, deterring holiday campers and burning 
a dozen homes. By Saturday, fire officials said they had the blaze 
80 percent contained. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're such a strong outdoor-oriented area -- hiking, biking,  
fishing, boating, so we're dependent on Mother Nature,'' said Jamie 
Wolcott, a year-round resident of this resort town, 6,750 feet up 
in the San Bernardino Mountains. ``There's nothing we can do about 
it, just hope for the best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The blaze was one of seven large California fires that burned  
more than 130,000 acres of forest and desert land in the state. Six 
other significant wildfires in Montana, Utah and Idaho were 
contained during the week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Willow fire in the San Bernardino National Forest has cost  
more than $8.5 million to fight. It started Aug. 28 near Lake 
Arrowhead and was initially believed to have been caused by an 
illegal campfire, but investigators are checking other 
possibilities, said Hal Seyden, spokesman for the U.S. Forest 
Service. 
</P>
<P>
	In Fawnskin, population 370, Barbara Moore made plans Saturday  
to roof her cabin with fire-resistant shingles. She had hoses ready 
in the yard and boxes throughout the house in case the family was 
forced to evacuate. 
</P>
<P>
	``It forces you to assess your life and decide what to take,''  
said Moore, 46. ``Once that was done, I didn't know what to do, so 
I baked cookies and brought them to the fire station.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other residents hung signs from their balconies thanking the  
more than 2,700 firefighters brought in to battle the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
	But in Apple Valley, several residents were angry that some  
homes had been left to burn. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Stutler, a commander with the U.S. Forest Service, told them  
that with so many wildfires burning throughout the West, 
firefighters and equipment had been scarce. Although they lost more 
than a dozen structures in the San Bernardino Mountains, they saved 
1,950, he said.

<HEADLINE> McCain Challenged on Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- Some conservation groups are challenging  
Republican presidential contender John McCain's record on the 
environment, even as McCain says his party should tackle the 
environmental issues it has long neglected. 
</P>
<P>
	``McCain has been a leader on certain Arizona issues, but that  
hasn't translated to the national level,'' said Lisa Wade, 
spokeswoman for the League of Conservation Voters. 
</P>
<P>
	In the last two years, McCain scored 29 percent and 0 percent,  
respectively, on the league's National Environmental Score Card. 
Congressmen are rated annually according to votes on issues such as 
mining, public lands and the storage of nuclear waste. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain has come under fire for trying to eliminate tax credits  
to ethanol and methanol producers. The tax credit program was 
designed two decades ago to promote a clean, homegrown alternative 
to imported oil. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain says the program is wasteful government spending.  
</P>
<P>
	He also has been criticized for writing legislation that  
re-authorized military use of a 2.7 million-acre bombing range in 
Arizona, and similar ranges in other states. 
</P>
<P>
	But during a recent trip to New Hampshire, McCain emphasized his  
environmental accomplishments. He helped place 3.5 million acres of 
Arizona land into ``pristine wilderness status,'' reduce the number 
of noisy flights over the Grand Canyon and regulate water flow from 
dams to protect the national treasure. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly in the Grand Canyon, John McCain has been a  
champion,'' said Rob Smith, Southwest staff director of the Sierra 
Club. ``But as a national senator, he certainly hasn't broken ranks 
with the anti-environmental Republican leadership of the current 
Congress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCain acknowledged Friday that Republicans should do more for  
the environment. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a party, we need to get back to some of the environmental  
issues that we may not have paid as much attention to,'' he told 
members of the New Hampshire Republicans for Responsible 
Conservation.

<HEADLINE> Mrs. Chirac Praises Mrs. Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- French first lady Bernadette Chirac, in an  
interview published Saturday, praised Hillary Rodham Clinton as a 
model woman for the millennium and a ``standard bearer'' for first 
ladies the world over. 
</P>
<P>
	She also backed Mrs. Clinton in her possible bid for Senate.  
</P>
<P>
	``She is so strong, so intelligent, so methodic,'' Mrs. Chirac  
said in the interview with the daily newspaper Le Monde in Moncton, 
New Brunswick, site of the summit of Francophone nations attended 
by President Jacques Chirac. 
</P>
<P>
	She referred to Mrs. Clinton while recounting the wishes  
expressed by several African first ladies to make a difference in 
their countries. Summit meetings of male leaders need not mean 
``vain and superficial'' gatherings for their wives, she added. 
</P>
<P>
	``It revolts me to see competent women marginalized or  
under-used,'' Mrs. Chirac said. ``Hillary Clinton is a standard 
bearer, a motor for all of us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, Mrs. Chirac hosted a visit by Mrs. Clinton to her  
native Correze, in central France. 
</P>
<P>
	``She is doing something very innovative. She will show the  
world what a woman, in the year 2000, is capable of doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The New York senatorial campaign that Mrs. Clinton is  
considering running in ``is going to be exciting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``She will be attacked, but she knows how to protect herself --  
unlike me. I hope so much that she will win,'' the French first 
lady was quoted by Le Monde as saying. Mrs. Clinton is still 
deciding whether to run for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by 
Daniel Patrick Moynihan.

<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- India deployed one million police and  
soldiers Saturday to provide security for the world's largest 
election, capping a campaign marred by militant threats and 
personal attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	By the time the five-phase, staggered voting ends Oct. 3, some  
600 million people will have been able to cast ballots for the 
federal legislature, which must convene by Oct. 21. Voting is 
staggered to help maintain security. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, more than 160 million voters are eligible to elect  
145 legislators, more than a quarter of India's lower house of 
Parliament, or Lok Sabha. Of the 1,068 candidates in Sunday's race, 
only 69 are women. 
</P>
<P>
	Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, riding a wave of personal  
popularity, is expected to lead his jigsaw coalition of nearly two 
dozen parties back to power. The election was called after 
Vajpayee's government lost a parliamentary vote of confidence by a 
single vote in April. 
</P>
<P>
	Polls show Vajpayee running well ahead of first-time candidate  
Sonia Gandhi, leader of the opposition Congress party, whose 
Italian birth has been a key issue in the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Gandhi is contesting one seat in Sunday's vote in Bellary  
in southern India. She also is running in another constituency in 
northern Uttar Pradesh state, where voting is scheduled Oct. 3. In 
India, candidates are allowed to contest up to 10 seats. If she 
wins more than one, she keeps the seat of her choice and must 
relinquish the others, where fresh elections must be held. 
</P>
<P>
	About 4.5 million civil servants will supervise 800,000 polling  
stations. Even schoolchildren -- 1.1 million of them -- have been 
asked to help. 
</P>
<P>
	Extra troops were sent to insurrection-plagued areas to prevent  
violence, either by political opponents or anti-Indian guerrilla 
forces. Liquor stores were ordered closed on Sunday, when voting 
begins at 8 a.m. (10:30 p.m. EDT Saturday.) 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, a senior police officer and two other policemen  
were shot at close range and killed in the southern state of Andhra 
Pradesh. Police blamed the outlawed People's War Group, which 
advocates social revolution and has threatened to disrupt the 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
	In the northern state of Jammu-Kashmir, three Islamic guerrillas  
stormed into a house and took six paramilitary and intelligence 
officers hostage. They had been working on security arrangements 
for the election. 
</P>
<P>
	After 16 hours, Indian commandos rescued all but one of the  
hostages and killed the three guerrillas, police said. One of the 
captured soldiers was killed by the rebels. 
</P>
<P>
	The campaign has been marred by bitter personal attacks,  
especially against Mrs. Gandhi, the 52-year-old widow of Rajiv 
Gandhi and daughter-in-law of Indira Gandhi, both former prime 
ministers who were assassinated. 
</P>
<P>
	Vajpayee's campaigners have said the election of a foreign-born  
prime minister would be an ``insult to the 1 billion Indians'' -- 
and even a security threat. 
</P>
<P>
	India claimed archrival Pakistan was linked to efforts to  
disrupt the voting. Police in New Delhi recently displayed 130 
pounds of plastic explosives, which allegedly came from Pakistan's 
Inter Services Intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
	Pakistan routinely denies Indian accusations that it supports  
militants in India.

Israel and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat signed a breakthrough 
land-for-security agreement Sunday designed to put in force accords

month to relinquish in three stages another 11 percent of land it

final peace agreement would be reached by September 2000, settling

	MOREHEAD CITY, N.C. (AP) -- There were no reports of significant  
damage or injuries as Tropical Storm Dennis washed ashore this 
afternoon and dumped torrential rains through much of eastern North 
Carolina. Dennis was expected to weaken rapidly as it sailed 
northwest through North Carolina. The rain accompanying the storm 
was likely to be more of a problem than its winds, said Michael

to determine in 45,000 of the accounts, while some 15,000 were 
thought to belong to Swiss citizens, the Geneva daily Le Temps 
said. The report added that bankers were concerned the conclusions,

<HEADLINE> Clinton Slams GOP Tax Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Challenging the Republican Congress to wake  
from its ``summer slumber,'' President Clinton said Saturday the 
pending GOP $792 billion tax cut would imperil prosperity, put 
Social Security at risk and bar needed investments in education. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, in his weekly radio address, set out an action agenda  
for the fall congressional session which he said should focus on 
paying off the national debt, ensuring Social Security's viability, 
strengthening and improving Medicare, investing in new schools and 
more teachers and passing laws designed to keep guns out of the 
wrong hands. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't believe we should squander our surplus, after being in  
debt for 30 years and quadrupling our national debt in just 12,'' 
Clinton said. ``I don't think we should do something that would 
imperil our prosperity or jeopardize our children's future by 
forcing crippling cuts in Social Security and Medicare, by failing 
to seize this opportunity to get America out of debt for the first 
time since 1835.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republican House and Senate members have spent their summer  
recess pitching their 10-year tax cut plan to their constituents. 
It has been passed by both houses. Clinton, who proposes a far more 
modest tax cut, has promised to veto the GOP bill it if it reaches 
his desk. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can meet our most pressing national priorities and still  
have sensible tax cuts,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Republican radio response, Rep. John Hostettler, R-Ind.,  
said the tax-cut bill would just return, to those who earned it in 
the first place, ``a $3 trillion federal tax overpayment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If you overpaid a utility company, you wouldn't allow it to  
keep this overcharge, would you?'' Hostettler asked. ``You would 
demand and deserve a refund. ... If you overpay the government, it 
is only fair that you get a refund in the form of tax relief.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Over a decade, the Republican tax-cut plan would reduce all  
income tax rates by one percentage point, cut capital gains taxes, 
improve retirement savings, ease the ``marriage penalty'' paid by 
many two-income couples, gradually eliminate the alternative 
minimum tax, provide new breaks for education and health care and 
benefit large and small businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	But Clinton called the proposal unacceptably hazardous and said  
the prosperity achieved during his administration is the best 
argument against it. 
</P>
<P>
	He cited as new evidence Friday's report that the unemployment  
rate has dipped to a 29-year low of 4.2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now we must use this moment of great promise to meet our large  
long-term challenges,'' the president said. ``The risky tax plan 
passed by the majority in Congress ... would make it impossible to 
pursue these other objectives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also announced he has sent a letter to Republican  
leaders renewing his call for Congress to pass a juvenile crime 
bill that requires safety locks for guns and closes a ``gun show 
loophole'' that now allows for no-questions-asked purchases of some 
guns. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton reminded his radio audience nearly five months since the  
fatal shootings at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	``It shouldn't take another tragedy to shake them from the  
summer slumber.'' he said.

When he did, they arrested him. 
</P>
<P>
	Sixx was nabbed Friday night at a show in Raleigh on charges of  
inciting a riot at a Greensboro concert in October 1997. Warrants 
were never served because of the cost of extradition, Guilford 
County Sheriff BJ Barnes said. 
</P>
<P>
	During the 1997 concert, Sixx allegedly directed racial slurs at  
a guard and encouraged the crowd of 2,500 to attack the guard. 
</P>
<P>
	The guards also said Sixx and drummer Tommy Lee poured a drink  
onto the guard's head. 
</P>
<P>
	Sixx was charged with felony rioting and misdemeanors of  
inciting a riot, simple assault and disorderly conduct. He posted 
$7,500 bond early Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee, who is wanted on the same misdemeanor charges as Sixx, was  
not arrested because he didn't perform at the show in Raleigh. 
Barnes said he hopes to arrest Lee the next time he comes to North 
Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	The guard and his employer filed a lawsuit against Sixx and Lee  
last year.

<HEADLINE> US Economic Boom Takes Many Shapes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TUPELO, Miss. (AP) -- From the vantage point of northeast  
Mississippi, there are two very different economic booms in these 
heady days of coast-to-coast prosperity. 
</P>
<P>
	One yields fabulous and sometimes fickle fortunes to faraway  
bond traders, speculators and Internet entrepreneurs. The other is 
right down the block, along Tupelo's no-frills Main Street, in the 
outlying malls and industrial parks, bringing low-key confidence 
and an abundance of modestly-paid jobs to a region whose elders 
still remember it as the poorest part of the poorest state. 
</P>
<P>
	People here don't thank Wall Street or Washington for their  
boom. They consider it the reward for hustle and tenacity. Even as 
they benefit, they question if the good times are fairly shared and 
wonder how well they can weather an eventual downturn. 
</P>
<P>
	``The past four or five years have been good ones, but they  
haven't been easy ones,'' says Jack Reed Jr., head of a clothing 
shop his family founded on Main Street in 1907. ``It's taken a heck 
of a lot of hard work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Across America, the boom takes many shapes as it moves through  
its ninth astounding year. Salaries and housing prices skyrocket in 
Silicon Valley; charitable donations reach record highs, and 
jobless rates near record lows; the barbecue industry reports 
sizzling demand for backyard grills that cost thousands of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Americans feel left out -- on debt-burdened family farms, in  
inner-city slums, in back-road pockets of Appalachia. For millions 
of others, in Tupelos large and small in every state, the boom is 
tangible and welcome, but not cause for euphoria or cockiness. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not millionaires, but we're comfortable,'' says Walter  
Partlow, a regional sales representative for a chain of electronics 
stores. He has helped his wife, Mary, open a self-service laundry 
in the black Tupelo neighborhood they recently left for a new 
subdivision. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people say for our ages, we've done okay,'' says  
Partlow, 37. ``But it's come from a lot of 12-hour days, six days a 
week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It is a boom of startling contrasts. In Tupelo's Lee County,  
where employment has soared from 40,000 to 54,000 since 1990, many 
of the new jobs pay $7 to $10 an hour, whether in the flourishing 
furniture industry or at the city's two Wal-Mart superstores. 
</P>
<P>
	At Silicon Valley's high-tech firms, teen-age summer hires can  
make $20 an hour writing computer code, and the average annual wage 
of software engineers exceeds $90,000. The valley's top 10 
executives last year received $442 million, mostly from stock 
options. Intel Corp.'s CEO Craig R. Barrett alone earned $116.8 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a disconnect from Main Street to Wall Street as far as  
the enormous amount of money these CEOs and bond traders are 
making,'' says storeowner Reed. ``It's two different worlds. On 
Main Street, in a family-owned business, there's no opportunity to 
get a million-dollar stock option and cash it in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His store, known simply as Reed's, has opened a branch at the  
new Barnes Crossing mall north of downtown, close to the Gap and 
Victoria's Secret and across the street from a huge Wal-Mart with 
discount clothing prices below any Reed's would ever offer. 
</P>
<P>
	Reed's has registered record sales in each of the past three  
years, but profits dipped slightly last year. Its staff tries to 
offset rivals' lower prices with neighborly charm, earning the 
title as friendliest store in the county two of the past three 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	But the strain of competing with national chains takes its toll.  
Reed wonders if his children should pursue another line of work, 
rather than battle to sustain the family tradition. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not everybody's in the same boat,'' he said. ``As a country,  
we need to assess whether our economic system is running fairly as 
well as fast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fairness of America's longest-ever peacetime boom can be  
debated, but its breadth is undeniable. An estimated 80 million to 
100 million Americans are now shareholders, riding the wave of 
rising stocks; even an economic trouble spot like Detroit has seen 
its jobless rate cut in half since 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosperity stretches into every region and almost every business  
sector. Sales of recreational vehicles are at a 21-year high; 
annual sales of barbecue grills -- including gadgets-galore 
``outdoor cooking systems'' priced at up to $10,000 -- have climbed 
in the decade from 11.5 million to 13.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``The backyard has become a major focal point of investment by  
families,'' says Donna Meyers, a spokeswoman for the Barbecue 
Industry Association. ``People save to buy a barbecue like they 
once saved to buy a family car.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In eastern Massachusetts, high-technology companies have helped  
create a ring of wealth with Boston at its core. But north of the 
city, strict federal regulations designed to protect cod have 
devastated Gloucester's fishing industry, forcing many fishermen to 
seek new occupations. 
</P>
<P>
	``They make good money, but they're not working in Gloucester,''  
says Angela Sanfilippo, head of the Fishermen's Wives Association. 
``They have to go to Boston and other places.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In perennially poor eastern Kentucky, the town of Pikeville is  
bustling with new construction and new businesses. But 44 of the 49 
counties in the rest of Appalachian Kentucky remain tagged as 
``economically distressed'' because of high poverty and jobless 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The contrasts are even starker in Iowa, where farmers are  
missing out on a robust boom that has lowered the state jobless 
rate to 2.6 percent. Prices for grain, hogs and milk have 
plummeted, and State Agriculture Secretary Patty Judge estimates 
Iowa could lose 6,000 farm families by next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The economy is booming, but farmers are definitely sitting and  
watching the boom and wondering what they did wrong,'' says Dianna 
Fuhrmeister. She and her husband, John, raise chickens, cattle and 
sheep on a small farm north of Iowa City. 
</P>
<P>
	Tupelo, population 38,000, had a destitute farm economy back  
when its most famous native son, Elvis Presley, was born in 1935. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the past 40 years, its civic leaders have relentlessly  
wooed investment, attracting a variety of mid-size manufacturers. A 
modern medical center, touted as the nation's largest 
non-metropolitan hospital, employs 5,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee County's jobless rate has sunk to 4 percent, below the  
national rate of 4.3 percent. Per capita income is nearly $22,000, 
under the national average of $26,412 but above the Mississippi's 
$18,958 -- the lowest in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	The region is now a hub of the upholstered furniture industry,  
spearheaded by Furniture Brands International. The company's local 
work force is 3,700, with a $120 million payroll. 
</P>
<P>
	Mickey Holliman, the company's CEO, is delighted by ``the  
awesome work ethic'' of his employees, though he doesn't rule out 
the possibility that some local operations might depart for 
countries with cheaper labor. 
</P>
<P>
	Mary Werner, a former school teacher, came from Massachusetts  
with her husband in 1992 and rescued a smaller furniture company 
from near-death. In seven years, Tupelo Manufacturing, which makes 
chairs for schools, motels and nursing homes, has boosted its work 
force from 23 to 80 and its annual sales from $1 million to $5 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of it has to do with hard work,'' she says. But she is  
an avid fan of Mississippi's business climate, saying taxes are 
lower and authorities more supportive than in Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the best state to do business in,'' she says. ``They  
really love business here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Such enthusiasm among executives is less prevalent on factory  
floors. 
</P>
<P>
	``The last three years have been very good years. There's no  
denying that,'' says Thomas Palley, an economic analyst for the 
AFL-CIO in Washington. ``But there has been a general downsizing of 
expectations. We've gotten used to doing so badly that when there's 
good news we say, 'Wow, this is the best economy we've ever had,' 
which is not the case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even in mid-boom, Palley says, some companies are cutting back  
on health benefits and pension coverage, and many new jobs are 
low-paid service positions ``that kick away the ladder to the 
middle class.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, too much is being allocated to shareholders'  
profits,'' he says. ``We've got to ensure that everyone can share 
in this boom.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Robert Jamison, pastor of Tupelo's New Providence  
Missionary Baptist Church and president of Lee County's NAACP 
chapter, is another share-the-boom advocate. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tupelo is very prosperous, but the prosperity is one-sided,''  
he tells a visitor to his red-brick church in Tupelo's biggest 
black neighborhood, full of comfortable wood-frame homes formerly 
owned by whites. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do have some African-Americans who are prospering, but most  
are being left out of the big economic picture -- ownership and 
investment,'' Jamison says. ``Those things are not even being 
mentioned.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tupelo's white leaders are savvy, he said, providing enough  
services and economic opportunities ``to keep down any agitation 
that would cause disturbances.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The only people not working now are those who don't want to,''  
Jamison adds. ``There are plenty of jobs, but most are minimum 
wage. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our kids have high ambitions. They want to be doctors,  
lawyers. They go away to school and they don't want to come back 
here. That hurts. That's why I tell white folks: We've got to open 
up things for everybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walter and Mary Partlow also want to see Tupelo's prosperity  
spread more evenly into the black neighborhoods where their 
relatives live and where Mrs. Partlow runs the Park Hill Laundry. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sorry. I don't feel it's such a boom like they say it  
is,'' she says. ``This community is the last one on the totem pole. 
A lot of my customers are living check to check.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nationwide, the prosperity has produced a peculiar mix of  
problems, including labor shortages in many regions. In Wisconsin, 
for example, hundreds of European college students were recruited 
to work at tourist attractions this summer because local workers 
were scarce. 
</P>
<P>
	Ed Looney, executive director of New Jersey's Council on  
Compulsive Gambling, says the perception of good times has worsened 
problem gambling. 
</P>
<P>
	``You might think people gamble more in desperate times,'' says  
Looney, himself a recovering compulsive gambler. ``But in a boom 
time, when people have excess money, they will try gambling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steven Brobeck, executive director of the Consumer Federation of  
America, says credit card companies also are guilty of pushing 
people beyond their financial limits. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a large number of families on the edge of a  
financial precipice,'' says Brobeck. ``The credit card companies 
are relentless... They have dramatically increased their marketing 
at a time when many families are trying to act with greater 
restraint.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A different kind of boom problem has surfaced in Arizona, where  
a population explosion is generating record profits for 
homebuilders while unsettling environmentalists. Air pollution and 
gridlock plague Phoenix, a car-loving metropolis where one freeway 
is targeted for expansion to 12 lanes. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got masses of homes and cars just jammed up everywhere,  
and now after all the homes are there, they are saying, 'Well, what 
should we do about traffic?'' complains Sandy Bahr of the local 
Sierra Club. ``You can plan well or plan fast. In Arizona's case, 
we've done neither.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nationwide, the short-term future is debated inconclusively by  
pessimists and optimists. In Tupelo, where few folks feel they have 
speculated themselves out onto a limb, there is little sense of 
unease. 
</P>
<P>
	Aubrey Patterson is chairman and CEO of Tupelo-based  
BancorpSouth, a bank with 160 branches in Mississippi, Alabama and 
Tennessee whose assets have surged to $5.2 billion in four years. 
He sounds confident even while predicting some sort of slowdown 
soon. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been on a spending spree in the past couple of years,  
with little increase in personal savings,'' he says. ``You can't 
keep on like that. 
</P>
<P>
	``This region won't be immune, but I think we'll fare better  
than average in a downturn. A lot of companies say their most 
productive plants are here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holliman, the furniture executive, is more optimistic. He  
believes the best days are still ahead for the nation -- and for 
Tupelo --if its workers stay ahead of the curve in education and 
training. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the next five years are going to be absolutely  
terrific,'' he says. ``Some in the investment community say we're 
in the ninth inning. I think we're in the early innings.''

<HEADLINE> Money Manager Martin Frankel Nabbed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) -- Missing money manager Martin Frankel,  
believed to have embezzled millions in investment scams, has been 
captured, the FBI said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Lisa Bull, a spokeswoman for the FBI in New Haven, would not  
disclose any other details. Authorities were scheduled to hold a 
news conference Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Frankel, 44, has not been seen since May 5, when an automatic  
alarm called firefighters to his high-security mansion in 
Greenwich. They found a blazing file cabinet and two fireplaces 
stuffed with burning documents. 
</P>
<P>
	He was believed to have been living as a fugitive in Europe.  
</P>
<P>
	Frankel is suspected of embezzling at least $218 million -- and  
perhaps as much as $915 million -- from seven insurance companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Six were in the South -- three in Mississippi, and one each in  
Arkansas, Tennessee and Oklahoma -- and one was a Southern border 
state, Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
	Frankel allegedly controlled Thunor Trust, set up in 1991 by  
Franklin businessman John Hackney to buy small, struggling 
insurance companies. Through his lawyer, Hackney has denied any 
wrongdoing and said he is a victim of Frankel. 
</P>
<P>
	Those insurance companies believed their policyholder money was  
being invested through Frankel's brokerage firm, Liberty National 
Securities. But apparently, no trades were ever made. Instead, 
prosecutors say Frankel stole the money. 
</P>
<P>
	Also missing is as much as $1.98 billion from the St. Francis of  
Assisi Foundation, which investigators say was established by 
Frankel in the British Virgin Islands last August.

<HEADLINE> 'Chicks Call Me' Brings Good Value </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RUIDOSO DOWNS, N.M. (AP) -- It is the pursuit and passion of  
every thoroughbred owner. To breed or buy the next Secretariat. To 
find another Charismatic. 
</P>
<P>
	It is no less a goal for those who race quarter horses and chase  
victory in the All American Futurity, the 440-yard race that is to 
sprinters what the Kentucky Derby is to milers. 
</P>
<P>
	Oklahomans W.R. Anglin and C.E. Tuggle believe they have that  
kind of a horse in their 2-year-old gray gelding, Chicks Call Me. 
</P>
<P>
	Bought by Tuggle for $1,700 last year, Chicks Call Me has turned  
out to be just as terrific a bargain as Charismatic, the chestnut 
thoroughbred purchased for $200,000 who has earned more than $2 
million and this summer came within a few yards of becoming the 
first Triple Crown winner in 21 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicks Call Me is unbeaten in six races this year and already  
has earned more than $272,000. His next start is Monday in the All 
American, where the winner gets $1 million from the total purse of 
$2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Anglin and Tuggle have been buying horses together since the  
early '90s. After Tuggle bought the gray, he offered Anglin a half 
interest. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a gift horse,'' said Anglin, who owns a small farm and is  
director of maintenance for a trucking company in Tulsa. ``You 
spend 30 years trying to raise good horses and then something like 
this comes along for almost nothing. It's a gift. A good gift.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tuggle, owner of a wire cable company, bought the horse from  
John Hamer, a horse trader in Collinsville, Okla. Hamer had bought 
the gelding from a Louisiana trainer for $2,500. 
</P>
<P>
	The futurity field was determined two weeks ago in 17 time  
trials. The 10 horses with the fastest times in the trials got in, 
and Chicks Call Me had the second-fastest time that day, 21.607 
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	More importantly to Anglin and Tuggle, their horse came out of  
the trials in good shape. Since 2-year-old quarter horses are 
highly susceptible to injury, their owners try to limit the number 
of races they run, with the idea of pointing them for the bigger 
races such as the All American. 
</P>
<P>
	``The morning after the trials, we took him out of his stall and  
he was kicking and bucking,'' Tuggle said. ``You'd have sworn he 
was ready to run again that day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Given the competition he'll face, Chicks Call Me better be ready  
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	His challengers include four other geldings and five fillies.  
</P>
<P>
	A Delightful Dasher, a gelding owned by Gwendolyn Eaves of  
Midland, Texas, won his trial by two lengths and had the fastest 
time of the day, 21.533. In only four races -- three wins and a 
second -- A Delightful Dasher has earned more than $225,000. Most of 
that came with his win in the $525,000 Rainbow Futurity in July 
over the same Ruidoso Downs track. 
</P>
<P>
	He Rocks, another gelding, also scored an impressive win in the  
trials. 
</P>
<P>
	He Rocks, with two wins and two seconds this year, had  
arthroscopic surgery in May to remove a bone chip from his left 
knee. His first race back was in the trials, where he won by nearly 
two lengths. 
</P>
<P>
	The two other geldings in the race are Snappy Dragon and  
Southern Cash Man. 
</P>
<P>
	The five fillies are Tell Her More, Familiar Faces, Tiny First  
Down, Moolah Memories and Significant Speed. 
</P>
<P>
	Tell Her More, owned by Robert Moore of Norman, Okla., is  
trained by Jack Brooks, who has saddled seven All American winners 
since 1978. He won last year's futurity with another filly, Falling 
In Loveagain.

<HEADLINE>  Small Turnout for Peaceful NYC Rally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The second Million Youth March drew about 2,000  
people to the streets of Harlem on Saturday after weeks of 
name-calling and a legal tug-of-war between organizers and city 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
	The rally was calm in contrast to last year's march, which ended  
in a bottle-throwing melee and 28 injuries after police in riot 
gear tried to enforce a court-ordered curfew. 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers opened Saturday's rally with a prayer, and most of  
the speakers offered uplifting messages encouraging black youths to 
stay in school and to treat one another with dignity. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whose streets? Our streets!'' shouted one group of marchers,  
although most of the participants were more subdued. Paulette 
Washington, who works in Harlem, was walking with a sandwich board 
with the words: ``Execute racism.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If we can't live together, we'll die together,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	The rally was monitored by 1,500 police officers, some stationed  
on rooftops. They did not arrive in riot gear this year, and there 
were about half as many officers as in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	No conflicts were reported.  
</P>
<P>
	Prior to this year's march, organizer Khallid Abdul Muhammad  
labeled Mayor Rudolph Giuliani a ``cracker'' after the mayor called 
the rally a ``hate march.'' Organizers took the city to court to 
get a permit for the rally when city officials turned them down, as 
they did in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's crowd was barely a third of last year's turnout of  
6,000. Reporters covering the event estimated there were about 
2,000 people; police estimated there were under 1,000. Harlem 
politicians had encouraged a boycott of the march after Muhammad -- 
a former Nation of Islam spokesman fired for his anti-Semitic 
comments -- made inflammatory statements during the Million Youth 
March's debut last year. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, Giuliani thanked New Yorkers for the relatively  
low turnout. ``Today, New Yorkers demonstrated by their absence, 
their overwhelming support for tolerance and decency,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	During his hour-long speech, Muhammad attacked Giuliani,  
labeling those who called for a boycott ``Uncle Toms,'' and 
accusing Jews of sanctioning slavery. Muhammad's address ended the 
rally, with the crowd dispersing quietly. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney Malik Shabazz, another rally organizer, held up a  
picture of the mayor at the rally Saturday and told the crowd, ``We 
charge this man with crimes against the black nation!'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Guilty! Guilty!'' some shouted back.  
</P>
<P>
	Shabazz also made anti-Semitic remarks and told the crowd, ``The  
only solution any time there is a funeral in the black community is 
a funeral in the police community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While some in the crowd applauded the speakers and joined a  
chant of ``Black power,'' others along Malcolm X Boulevard were 
apathetic. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't both me as long as it goes smoothly,'' said Gloria  
Johnson. ``It's OK to have a Million Youth March as long as it's 
done with finesse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two teens from the Bronx, Devon Speaks and Robert Pitts, said  
they attended the rally to judge it for themselves. Neither had 
much positive to say about Muhammad. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think what he has to say is a lot of foolishness,'' said  
Pitts, 14.

<HEADLINE> Castro Will Allow Cuba To Compete </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAVANA (AP) -- President Fidel Castro said Saturday that Cuba  
will continue to compete in the Pan Am Games and other 
international sporting events even though he is suspicious of drug 
tests flunked by his country's athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	Castro is demanding an investigation of the tests.  
</P>
<P>
	``We are not breaking with any institution,'' the Cuban  
president said toward the end of the second and last televised 
hearing on the drug issue, which continued into early Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Castro said Pan American Sports Organization president Mario  
Vazquez Rana had expressed interest in Cuba's demand for an 
investigation. Vazquez Rana had no immediate public comment, 
however, following Castro's public demands. 
</P>
<P>
	Castro said on Friday the IOC should look into the drug tests at  
the Pan Am Games last month and he demanded four Cuban athletes who 
tested positive for banned steroids get back their medals. 
</P>
<P>
	``And for much more,'' he said during his five-hour televised  
speech. ``To return the honor of these scorned athletes. We will 
not rest until it is achieved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Castro asked that IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch form a  
commission to follow up on Cuba's charges of irregularities in drug 
tests given to world champion high jumper Javier Sotomayor and 
three weight lifting medal winners at the games in Winnipeg, 
Alberta. 
</P>
<P>
	Castro said the gold medals taken from Sotomayor and weight  
lifters William Vargas and Rolando Delgado, and the silver medal 
stripped from weight lifter Modesto Sanchez should be returned. 
</P>
<P>
	Castro also wants the commission to look into disputed bouts at  
the International Amateur Boxing Association Championships last 
month. After one match, the association suspended four judges for 
irregularities after giving a Russian fighter a victory over a 
Cuban. The decision was reversed and the Cuban was given the gold 
medal. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday night, Castro, along with a leading sports official  
and a top sports doctor, said that multiple urine tests on the 
weight lifters conducted by Cuba and sent to three different 
laboratories in Europe all failed to show the steroid Nandrolone. 
The tests were conducted four to five days after the athletes 
returned to Cuba from the Pan Am Games, Castro said. 
</P>
<P>
	Steroids are injected into the body to increase strength and  
bulk and can remain in a person's system for months. 
</P>
<P>
	Not a single athlete in our weight lifting team was using  
drugs,'' Castro said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sotomayor tested positive for cocaine. Castro said it would be  
``absurd'' to believe that Sotomayor took cocaine before he won his 
fourth straight gold medal, because the large quantity found in his 
system would have impeded his performance, Castro said. 
</P>
<P>
	He suggested that new tests could be conducted on the  
weightlifters if necessary because steroids remain in the system. 
One reporter said tests on a person's hair could determine cocaine 
use, but Castro said he was unwilling to require Sotomayor to go 
through any more tests. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be undignified to submit Sotomayor to these types of  
tests,'' Castro said. ``That would have to be decided by 
Sotomayor.''

<HEADLINE> Mets Activate Reed, Franco </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- New York Mets pitchers John Franco and Rick Reed  
were activated from the 15-day disabled list prior to Saturday 
night's game against the Colorado Rockies. 
</P>
<P>
	Franco, out since July 3 with a torn tendon in his left middle  
finger, has 19 saves in 20 opportunities. He is 0-2 with a 3.45 ERA 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``John was very persuasive,'' Mets general manager Steve  
Phillips said. ``All the reports on both guys were good, and we 
thought it'd be better to activate John now, than to send him back 
to New Haven to pitch another inning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The left-hander threw 18 pitches in 1 1-3 scoreless innings for  
Double-A Binghamton on Friday in his only rehabilitation 
assignment. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt good,'' Franco said of his minor league outing. ``I  
kept my pitches down, and I got groundball outs. I spent more time 
in the car than I did on the field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reed is 10-4 with a 4.94 ERA in 21 starts, and has been out  
since straining his right middle finger on Aug. 8 against Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	The right-hander allowed nine runs and ten hits in a  
three-inning rehab start for Triple-A Norfolk on Aug. 27. He is 
scheduled to start Tuesday night against San Francisco.

<HEADLINE> Cancer Patients' Will Fluctuates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The will to live in dying cancer patients  
fluctuates enormously, research led by a psychiatrist in Canada 
suggests. 
</P>
<P>
	The research team also concluded that as death gets closer,  
physical distress replaces mental anxiety as the main factor 
weakening the wish to go on living. 
</P>
<P>
	Reporting in Saturday's issue of the British medical journal The  
Lancet, Dr. Harvey Chochinov, professor of psychiatry and family 
medicine at Canada's University of Manitoba, said the study is both 
a contribution to the complex issue of euthanasia as well as a 
potential aid to improving care for dying patients. 
</P>
<P>
	The study involved 168 patients admitted to the Riverview  
Palliative Care Unit in Winnipeg, Manitoba, between November 1993 
and March 1995. It found that over a 12-hour period, the patients' 
will to live could fluctuate by 30 percent or more. Over a 30-day 
period, the fluctuations were up to 70 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``The findings of this study suggest that will to live is highly  
unstable among terminally ill cancer patients,'' Chochinov and 
fellow researchers wrote in The Lancet's report. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although we know now that occasional or fleeting thoughts of a  
desire for death are common among the terminally ill and that some 
of these patients express a genuine desire for death, little is 
known about how these thoughts may change over the course of 
time,'' they wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the patients in the study were elderly -- although there  
was one 31-year-old -- and all were in an advanced stage of terminal 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	They were screened to make sure they had the mental competence  
and physical strength to take part in the study. It involved 
filling out a questionnaire twice a day and continued in most cases 
until shortly before death. 
</P>
<P>
	The patients rated themselves on a 100-point scale measuring  
pain, nausea, shortness of breath, appetite, drowsiness, 
depression, sense of well-being, anxiety, and activity. 
</P>
<P>
	They also rated the strength of their will to live on a scale  
with ``complete will to live'' and ``no will to live'' at the 
extremes. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the patients were enrolled in the study 24 hours after  
being admitted to the center, and initially anxiety was the single 
most important factor repressing their will to live. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, depression became the most significant factor, and as  
death became imminent, shortness of breath was the main cause of 
reducing the will to live. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers noted that the findings might be different among  
a group of younger terminally ill people or patients dying from 
other causes such as AIDS, degeneration of the central nervous 
system or heart disease. 
</P>
<P>
	But the group studied was still representative of some of the  
patients at the center of the euthanasia debate, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Newman Helps Save Land, Throws Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WESTON, Conn. (AP) -- After helping their neighbors preserve 730  
acres of woodlands, Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward celebrated the 
occasion with a party at Town Hall. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple, along with several of their family members, attended  
a champagne reception to mark a land trust's closing on the $12.4 
million tract of land known as Trout Brook Valley. The land is 
located in Weston and Easton; the Newmans live in neighboring 
Westport. 
</P>
<P>
	Newman, through his Newman's Own Inc. food company, donated  
$500,000 to the land-preservation cause. He and Woodward also 
starred in a benefit performance of the play ``Love Letters'' at 
the Westport Country Playhouse, raising another $175,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Woodward said she was elated land preservationists were  
successful in blocking the property from being developed into a 
golf course and luxury housing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe in doing whatever we can to preserve land  
anywhere,'' she said. ``We have to do this for our grandchildren.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The battle to save the land from development began three years  
ago. The state agreed to pay $6 million over two years to help 
preserve the land, while a coalition of government and conservation 
groups raised millions.

<HEADLINE> Favorites Split Stallion Stakes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- The favorites won both halves of the $125,000  
Stallion Stakes at Calder on Saturday with Sabre Dance, at even 
money, taking the Susan's Girl Division by a neck and Snuck In, an 
overwhelming choice at 3-to-10, much the best in the Affirmed 
Division. 
</P>
<P>
	Both winners earned $75,000 and are in the position for a major  
payday Oct. 16 in the third and final phase of the Stallion Stakes 
-- especially Snuck In who can earn $290,000 with a victory in the 
In Reality (open) division of the series for 2-year-olds. Sabre 
Dance, if she wins the My Dear Girl (filly) division will have to 
settle for $240,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Snuck In would earn a $50,000 bonus for sweeping all three races  
in the Open class. Sabre Dance did not run in the filly division 
opener. 
</P>
<P>
	Snuck In's victory was much more impressive than Sabre Dance's.  
He ran seven furlongs in the 1:24 1-5 and finished 4 1/4 lengths in 
front of B L's Appeal. Sabre Dance was timed in 1:25 2-5 and was 
all out to win a photo over Fast Dispersal. 
</P>
<P>
	Ridden by Robbie Albarado, Snuck In paid $2.60, $2.20 and $2.10.  
B L's Appeal paid $4.40 and $3.20. Bold Meridian was third and paid 
$3.80. Sabre Dance, ridden by Eibar Coa, paid $4, $2.80 and $2.10. 
Fast Dispersal paid $3.80 and $2.10. Sweeping, the second choice at 
2-1, was third and also paid $2.10. 
</P>
<P>
	Snuck In broke sharply from the outside and was on the pace all  
the way. He took the lead at the top of the stretch and drew out 
with every stride in the final furlong. B L's Appeal, who fought 
for the lead into the stretch, held on for second by a half-length 
over long shot Bold Meridian, who was another half-length ahead of 
Sign of Fire, who came from last to finish fourth in the field of 
eight. 
</P>
<P>
	Snuck In, owned by Ackerly Brothers Farm, has won three of five  
starts with a second and a third, earning $159,820. The 2-year-old 
Florida-bred is a son of Montbrook. 
</P>
<P>
	Sabre Dance, making only the second start of her career after  
breaking her maiden by six lengths Aug. 15, came from next to last 
at the half-mile pole. She moved to the outside on the far turn and 
was four wide turning for home. 
</P>
<P>
	Sabre Dance took the lead from Fast Dispersal in the midstretch  
and outgamed her in the final sixteenth. Fast Dispersal was 2 1/2 
lengths in front of Sweeping, who had won the opener of the filly 
division at six furlongs on Aug. 7. 
</P>
<P>
	The undefeated daughter of Sword Dancer, owned by Alan Drey, has  
earned $93,200.

<HEADLINE> Penn State Top Athletic Department </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Penn State not only is one of the top football  
programs in the country, it also has one of the best athletic 
departments, according to a survey in this week's The Sporting 
News. 
</P>
<P>
	In a survey of the 112 U.S. colleges and universities that  
participate in both NCAA Division I football and men's basketball, 
Penn State received ``A'' grades in three of the four categories, 
including ``Do We Win?'', ``Do We Graduate?'', ``Do We Rock?'', and 
Do We Play Fair?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The rest of the top ten consisted of North Carolina, Notre Dame,  
Stanford, Florida, Duke, Purdue, Virginia, Nebraska and Michigan 
State. 
</P>
<P>
	In the second ten were Iowa, Wisconsin, Michigan, Kentucky,  
Syracuse, UCLA, Northwestern, Illinois, Ohio State and Washington. 
Rounding out the top 25 were Indiana, Florida State, Arizona, 
Georgia Tech and Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
	The Big Ten led with 10 schools in the top 25, followed by the  
ACC with five. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do We Win?'' awards points for victories, regular-season  
conference championships, conference tournament championships, rank 
in The Sporting News poll, and performance in bowl games and the 
NCAA basketball tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do We Graduate?'' uses the ``freshman-cohort'' graduation rate  
for both sports as the most recent measure of academic achievement 
for the four classes which entered school in the 1989-92 period, 
allowing six years for a degree. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Do We Rock?'' category measures fan support, attendance,  
merchandise sold, size of athletic budget, number of teams, and 
points awarded in the annual Sears Directors' Cup competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, ``Do We Play Fair?'' uses Title IX compliance, the  
``freshman-cohort'' graduation rate for all student-athletes, and 
graduation rate for those using all their athletic eligibility at 
one school. It also takes into account NCAA probation and the 
addition or subtraction of teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Penn State received ``A's'' in every category, except ``Do We  
Win?'', which gave the Nittany Lions an ``A-minus'' for the 
basketball team's failure to make a postseason tournament. Penn 
State's overall grade average was 3.92. 
</P>
<P>
	The first-time survey is expected to help college-bound  
athletes, university recruiters, and high school coaching staffs 
and guidance counselors. 
</P>
<P>
	The grading process is similar to that generally used by  
colleges, with 4.0 for A, 3.0 for B, and so forth. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey appears in the Sept. 13 issue of The Sporting News.

<HEADLINE> Sen.'s Aide Alleges Sex Harassment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HELENA, Mont. (AP) -- Sen. Max Baucus' top aide is accusing him  
of firing her after she confronted him over repeated sexual 
advances to her over the past 15 months. Baucus denied the 
allegations in a statement Friday, calling them ``frivolous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The accusation was made by Baucus' chief of staff, Christine  
Niedermeier, through her attorney, Elaine Charlson Bredehoft, who 
told The Associated Press in a telephone interview her client was 
``a victim of sexual harassment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bredehoft said Baucus had U.S. Capitol police officers stop  
Niedermeier from removing personal items from her office, including 
e-mail messages she claims will support the accusations against the 
senator. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was victim of being terminated when she said no, when she  
had a right to do that,'' Bredehoft said. Although Baucus never 
touched Niedermeier, he was ``commenting frequently on her 
appearance and suggesting things they could do together; go away 
for a weekend together,'' Bredehoft added. 
</P>
<P>
	Jean Manning, the Senate's chief counsel on employment issues,  
told the AP that Baucus informed Niedermeier last month he planned 
to fire her because most of his staff had threatened to resign over 
her ``intolerable management style.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He had 36 people in the office threatening to quit,'' said  
Manning, who represents senators in employment disputes. ``He tried 
to take appropriate action which was to terminate the cause of the 
problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Manning accused Niedermeier of concocting the sexual harassment  
claim in an effort to discourage Baucus from firing her. ``This was 
made up after the fact,'' Manning said, adding that Niedermeier has 
been on leave but would be terminated next Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Lombardi, a spokesman for Baucus, said the senator would  
not talk with reporters about Niedermeier's charges. 
</P>
<P>
	But in a prepared statement issued by his offices here and in  
Washington, Baucus said Niedermeier's allegations ``have absolutely 
no basis in fact.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Prior to making these allegations, I suggested to her that she  
seek new employment,'' Baucus said in the statement. ``I regret 
that her response has been to assert these frivolous charges 
against me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bredehoft said Niedermeier, 47 and single, has never had a  
sexual relationship with Baucus, 52 and married. 
</P>
<P>
	Niedermeier, who has been Baucus' staff chief since May 1998,  
did not confront him with her complaint until last month, Bredehoft 
told Roll Call, a Capitol Hill newspaper, which first published the 
story Friday on its Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	Bredehoft said her client hasn't decided yet whether to file a  
formal sexual harassment complaint against Baucus.

<HEADLINE> Dennis Washes Ashore in N. Carolina </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOREHEAD CITY, N.C. (AP) -- After a week of wandering off the  
North Carolina coast, Tropical Storm Dennis washed ashore Saturday 
afternoon and dumped torrential rains through much of eastern North 
Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no reports of significant damage or injuries.  
Flooding was reported in several coastal counties, along with 
scattered power outages. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Weather Service reported that the center of Dennis'  
huge eye crossed the Core Banks shortly before 5 p.m. just south of 
Cedar Island. Sustained winds for the storm were clocked at 70 mph, 
just short of hurricane force, when it came ashore. Later the winds 
decreased to about 60 mph 
</P>
<P>
	Residents of fishing villages on the marshy peninsula where the  
storm hit said damage from the storm Saturday were not as bad as 
Monday when it pounded them on its first pass. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like a calm period right now,'' Cecile Huneycutt of  
Gloucester said as the leading edge of the storm's eye passed 
through. ``We've had a lot of rain. 
</P>
<P>
	``The water's everywhere,'' she said. ``Our yards are just about  
under, but it's not close to getting into the house.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Addertion, emergency management coordinator for Carteret  
County, said it appeared the worst was over once the storm made 
landfall. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's under control, I believe,'' Addertion said.  
</P>
<P>
	Dennis was expected to weaken rapidly as it sailed northwest  
through North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	Nobody was sad to see it go after nearly two weeks off the U.S.  
coast, said Stacy Stewart, a meteorologist at the National 
Hurricane Center in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like a dripping faucet that won't quit and won't go  
away,'' Stewart said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis has been anything but a typical storm, said Stacy Stewart  
of the National Hurricane Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart said tropical storm force or stronger winds usually  
affect a single area for 12 hours or less on average. ``That 
includes the approach, the center passing over, and retreating.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``North Carolina has been getting battered for pretty close to a  
week,'' Stewart said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tropical storm warnings were in effect along much of the North  
Carolina shoreline and extended north along the Virginia coast to 
Chincoteague, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	Farther north, in southeastern Virginia, an apparent tornado  
touched down in the city of Hampton, damaging several apartment 
buildings and an assisted living center, and injuring more than a 
dozen people. 
</P>
<P>
	Another twister hit a barn and snapped utility poles in nearby  
Chesapeake, Va., police said. 
</P>
<P>
	At 10 p.m., Dennis was centered around New Bern and moving  
northwest at about 10 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Flooding closed roads farther north in Craven and Pamlico  
counties. Flooding also was reported as far north as Elizabeth 
City. 
</P>
<P>
	Floodwaters forced officials in the Beaufort County town of  
Belhaven to move police operations from the police department to 
the municipal building, which is on higher ground. 
</P>
<P>
	As Dennis headed inland, emergency management officials opened  
18 shelters in nine coastal counties. 
</P>
<P>
	Tourists on Hatteras Island who ignored evacuation orders last  
weekend found themselves stranded for a second time Saturday when 
the rising wind from the approaching storm disrupted ferry service 
to the mainland. 
</P>
<P>
	A few tourists had left the island Thursday and Friday when the  
first ferries delivered emergency supplies and heavy equipment to 
Hatteras and Ocracoke Island. 
</P>
<P>
	Engineers worked Saturday to rebuild N.C. 12, the only highway  
along the low-lying, fragile Outer Banks. The highway had been open 
to residents with four-wheel-drive vehicles, but was closed again 
Saturday afternoon as the wind increased and torrential rain 
flooded the island. 
</P>
<P>
	As the storm moved inland Saturday evening, 80 people took  
shelter at Pamlico County Community College in Grantsboro, said Tim 
Harvey, the county's emergency management coordinator.

<HEADLINE> Money Manager Martin Frankel Nabbed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) -- Missing money manager Martin Frankel,  
accused of embezzling millions of dollars to fund his reclusive yet 
luxurious lifestyle, was arrested Saturday in Germany 
</P>
<P>
	``You got me,'' Frankel said as the FBI and German police  
arrested him at the upscale Hotel Prem in Hamburg, Germany,'' FBI 
Special Agent Michael Wolf said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The arrest ended an international manhunt that lasted more than  
four months. It could be two to three months before Frankel is 
extradited to Connecticut, Wolf said. 
</P>
<P>
	Frankel, 44, was apprehended without incident and charged with  
money laundering and wire fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	``As we were limiting his assets in various accounts and as we  
were following leads, I think he expected sooner or later that he 
would be apprehended,'' Wolf said. 
</P>
<P>
	Seized from his room were a computer and its contents and an  
undetermined amount of cash and diamonds, Wolf said. He could not 
say whether Frankel had been trading from his room. 
</P>
<P>
	Also taken into custody was a 35-year-old U.S. citizen, Cynthia  
Allison, who was using the alias Susan Kelly, Wolf said. He did not 
elaborate on Allison's relationship to Frankel. She was detained 
for questioning, but has not been charged. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities in the United States issued an arrest warrant for  
Frankel on July 14. He has been missing since May 5, when a fire 
alarm alerted firefighters to an emergency at his mansion in 
Greenwich. They found a blazing file cabinet and two fireplaces 
stuffed with burning documents. 
</P>
<P>
	Insurance company regulators said Frankel's unlicensed brokerage  
-- apparently run out of the $3 million Greenwich mansion -- had 
siphoned money several insurance companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Six were in the South -- three in Mississippi, and one each in  
Arkansas, Tennessee and Oklahoma -- and one was in a Southern border 
state, Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
	Regulators say Frankel stole at least $218 million from the  
insurers, but a lawsuit filed by some of the companies puts the 
loss at $915 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Frankel allegedly controlled Thunor Trust, set up in 1991 by  
businessman John Hackney to buy small, struggling insurance 
companies. Through his lawyer, Hackney has denied any wrongdoing 
and said he is a victim of Frankel. 
</P>
<P>
	Those insurance companies believed their policyholder money was  
being invested through Frankel's brokerage firm, Liberty National 
Securities. But apparently, no trades were ever made. Instead, 
prosecutors say Frankel stole the money. 
</P>
<P>
	Also missing is as much as $1.98 billion from the St. Francis of  
Assisi Foundation, which investigators say was established by 
Frankel in the British Virgin Islands last August. 
</P>
<P>
	Wolf said a tip led authorities to Frankel, who they had been  
tracking for some time. Frankel was believed to have lived for 
several weeks in Italy earlier this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Frankel may have been financing his run with more than $10  
million in diamonds and gold he bought before disappearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Law enforcement officials have said Frankel used several aliases  
after being barred from trading by the Securities and Exchange 
Commission in 1992, including David Rosse, the name of his personal 
bodyguard. 
</P>
<P>
	Frankel has been described by some investors as the Hugh Hefner  
of high finance, keeping a live-in retinue of young women he met 
through personal ads. 
</P>
<P>
	Frankel has described some of them as ``ex-girlfriends,'' but it  
isn't clear how many of the women he had sexual relationships with. 
At least some of the women performed office work at Frankel's 
unlicensed securities brokerage. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors say Frankel was gangly and neurotic, but offered an  
impressive biography and dedication, and that charmed them into 
trusting him with their money.

<HEADLINE> Maine Towns Squabble Over Sunlight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LUBEC, Maine (AP) -- Even before the dawn of the new millennium,  
they're already squabbling over who will see it first. 
</P>
<P>
	In Lubec, a blue-collar town of 1,800 people, the sign greeting  
visitors says ``Easternmost town in America,'' and the local 
newspaper calls itself the ``Most Easterly Newspaper Published in 
the United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So when the U.S. Naval Observatory declared that the summit of  
Cadillac Mountain, just outside Bar Harbor, would be the first 
place in the nation to see dawn on Jan. 1, 2000, folks here were 
taken aback. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some people can get quite bent out of shape over it,'' said  
John Smith, manager of Quoddy Head State Park in Lubec, home of a 
candy-striped lighthouse that stands sentry over the rocky coast. 
</P>
<P>
	In Bar Harbor, a renowned summer playground for the rich and  
famous, the desire for ``first light'' bragging rights is no less 
intense than in Lubec. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody wants to lay claim to this,'' said Jim Campbell, a  
Bar Harbor town official. ``Some people think it's great, a thrill, 
an honor, all that kind of stuff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lubec residents didn't take defeat lying down. If Bar Harbor  
could use Cadillac Mountain's 1,530-foot elevation in its 
calculation, they asked, what about their own Porcupine Mountain, 
which is only 210-feet high -- but 60 miles east? 
</P>
<P>
	Claiming a 30-second advantage, they asked the U.S. Naval  
Observatory to redo its calculations. The observatory's sunrise 
guru, James Hilton, went back to the drawing board. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Hilton revealed his findings: The first glimmer of  
sunlight on Jan. 1, 2000, will hit Porcupine Mountain and Cadillac 
Mountain at the same time, 7:04 a.m. EST. 
</P>
<P>
	Geoff Chester, an observatory spokesman, says the time cannot be  
figured more precisely because of the refraction -- bending -- of 
light in the atmosphere, which can cause fluctuations of 20 to 30 
seconds in its arrival at a given point. 
</P>
<P>
	Chester denied the tie was a compromise designed to let both  
towns save face. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have no political interest in either location,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	For the record, the observatory figures the first rays of  
sunlight of the millennium will reach the eastern tip of Nantucket, 
off Massachusetts, two minutes later, at 7:06 a.m. At 7:07 a.m., 
the light will reach the first large U.S. city, Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	While Lubec and Bar Harbor sparred, Lubec's neighbor, Eastport,  
claimed the honor of ``first light of the millennium for a city in 
the United States.'' No one has challenged the claim, though some 
think calling a community of 2,000 a city is using the term 
loosely. 
</P>
<P>
	Those eager to join in the festivities will have to brave  
Maine's harsh winter weather and will face sparse accommodations 
because most inns and bed and breakfasts shut down in the winter. 
</P>
<P>
	None of that is putting a damper on planned celebrations.  
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Angus King will be in Eastport for its millennium party.  
Bar Harbor will have fireworks. And Lubec's festivities include a 
flag-raising ceremony at sunrise at the lighthouse and a ``polar 
bear'' dip into the ocean for the daring. 
</P>
<P>
	Only a determined few will personally greet the sunrise atop  
Cadillac Mountain. The road to the summit will be closed so the 
mountain will be accessible only to skiers, snowmobilers or hikers, 
said David Buccello, chief ranger at Acadia National Park. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't prevent people from going up there. The best we can  
do is to emphasize the need to be prepared with expedition winter 
equipment and to have experience in winter hiking,'' he said.

<HEADLINE>  Angry French Farmers Protest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MARSEILLE, France (AP) -- Hundreds of angry farmers protesting  
American trade muscle and economic globalization bombarded riot 
police with apples on Saturday in this Mediterranean port city, the 
latest demonstration in two weeks of protests. 
</P>
<P>
	Security forces lobbed tear gas to stop the volley of apples  
thrown by 500 fruit and vegetable farmers armed with shopping carts 
from the Carrefour grocery store chain. 
</P>
<P>
	In a simultaneous protest, up to 200 protesting farmers, with  
cows, geese, pigs and a horses in tow, gathered in the Normandy 
town of Deauville, where the yearly American Film Festival was 
underway. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Americans came to help us 50 years ago,'' said Hilaire  
Taillecours, 62, from the Plateau du Neubourg in Normandy. ``But 
that doesn't mean they can tell us what to eat and how to film.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Taillecours raises cows and grows wheat and red beats on his  
125-acre farm. 
</P>
<P>
	His complaint reflected the expanding nature of the protest,  
which initially protested U.S. sanctions on a slew of products 
ranging from Roquefort cheese to foie gras. It has since expanded 
to include everything that symbolizes American ``hegemony'' in 
trade and agriculture, and globalization. 
</P>
<P>
	The protesters are all members of the radical agricultural  
union, the Farmers' Confederation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Globalization is creating absurd economic conflicts,'' the  
union said in an earlier statement. The aim of their protests is to 
``allow farmers and others to feed themselves as they think best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The farmers initially targeted McDonald's France as a symbol of  
globalization, landing union leader Jose Bove and four others in 
jail on Aug. 19 after a McDonald's construction site in the 
southern town of Millau was vandalized. 
</P>
<P>
	The imprisoned sheep farmer has quickly become a cause celebre  
of the movement, with offers from around France, and even from 
American farm groups, to pay his $17,000. McDonald's France dropped 
its damages claim against Bove, who refused a court offer to free 
him from jail last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Bove's lawyer, Francois Roux, said Friday that his client might  
go free by Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Tumor Removed From Cardinal's Brain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Doctors have removed a small tumor from the  
brain of Cardinal John J. O'Connor, his spokesman said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The tumor was diagnosed while the 79-year-old cardinal was  
hospitalized at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. He left the 
hospital on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Connor will get radiation therapy ``shortly and continue over  
the next several weeks,'' according to a statement released by the 
Archdiocese of New York. 
</P>
<P>
	He had been hospitalized for tests since August 25.  
</P>
<P>
	Doctors removed the ``small'' tumor from the surface of  
O'Connor's brain, and doctors found ``no other areas of the body 
were affected,'' the statement said. The Archdiocese would not say 
whether the tumor was malignant and didn't release any more medical 
information. 
</P>
<P>
	The cardinal, who became spiritual leader to 2.2 million New  
York-area Catholics in March 1984, was brought to the hospital 
complaining of nausea and weakness. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Connor walked out of Sloan-Kettering Hospital on Saturday  
morning to his car, and said Mass in his private residence 
adjoining St. Patrick's Cathedral, said his spokesman Joseph 
Zwilling. 
</P>
<P>
	In his high-profile position in New York, O'Connor has become  
one of the city's more prominent citizens -- co-authoring a book 
with ex-mayor Edward I. Koch, greeting the city's elite on the 
steps of the cathedral each St. Patrick's Day.

<HEADLINE> ESPN Turns Twenty Years Old </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- It all began with a public relations executive  
eager to find a way to televise Hartford Whalers hockey games 
throughout Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
	ESPN has long surpassed its humble origins, growing into a  
corporate power with one radio and four TV networks, a magazine, 
Web site and chain of restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
	Along the way, it has dramatically influenced how a generation  
views, and plays, the games -- erasing whatever line may have 
divided sports and entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
	ESPN is wherever sports fans congregate. Commuters at Grand  
Central Terminal gaze at ``SportsCenter'' as their shoes are 
shined. Pittsburgh Pirates cluster around a clubhouse set to watch 
highlights of a game they just played. Rap star Puff Daddy eyes 
ESPN in the lounge near his Manhattan studio. 
</P>
<P>
	For millions of viewers weaned on videotaped touchdowns and slam  
dunks, home runs and holes-in-one, life without ESPN is 
inconceivable. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet the network was only a sports fan's fantasy until Sept. 7,  
1979 -- 20 years ago this week. 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	William Rasmussen easily recalls the drive when he conceived  
ESPN's blueprint. It was Aug. 16, 1978. 
</P>
<P>
	A publicist for the former Whalers, he had hoped to harness the  
emerging cable TV technology to telecast their games. Before that 
could happen, Rasmussen and most everyone associated with the team 
were fired after a dismal 1977-78 season. He kept his TV contacts, 
though, and acquired a satellite transponder that enabled him to 
start a cable network. 
</P>
<P>
	But how? Rasmussen pondered the question that August afternoon  
as he drove from a Hartford suburb. His son suggested showing tapes 
of football games. By the time they reached the Jersey shore, 
Rasmussen had decided to try an all-sports network, ask the NCAA 
for the rights to televise college games and produce a prototype 
for a daily highlights show that would become ``SportsCenter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``When you have kids to feed and all of a sudden your job is  
gone, you think of things,'' he explains. 
</P>
<P>
	Rasmussen wanted the name Sports Programming Network, but that  
was already claimed. So he added ``E'' for Entertainment. In 1984, 
after he was gone, it became simply ESPN -- the letters no longer 
signifying words. 
</P>
<P>
	Like CNN for news and MTV for music, the idea seems obvious in  
retrospect. Cable was still a toddler then, and television was 
dominated by ABC, CBS and NBC. They aired some sports, but for a 
daily fix, viewers had to settle for brief segments during the 
local news. 
</P>
<P>
	``You didn't get highlights of every game. You didn't get  
previews of series. You picked up the paper and you opened it up 
and you looked to see how Rod Carew did,'' says Tony Gwynn, an 
outfielder for the San Diego Padres. ``Now, you come home from the 
park and turn on ESPN. You find out right away what's going on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	ESPN began by reporting on Chris Evert Lloyd's U.S. Open tennis  
victory over Billie Jean King. Its first live event followed: 1979 
Professional Slo-Pitch Softball World Series with the Milwaukee 
Schlitzes challenging the Kentucky Bourbons. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of baseball and basketball, early ESPN aired darts and  
billiards. Several milestones helped it gain its footing: first 
live coverage of the NCAA basketball tournament, 1980; first live 
college football, 1984; first NFL football, 1987 -- another first, 
when ESPN began making money. 
</P>
<P>
	(Analysts estimated ESPN and its spinoff, ESPN2, made $1.6  
billion last year.) 
</P>
<P>
	``It has only fed the fervor of the football enthusiast, the  
golf enthusiast, you name it,'' says golfer Hale Irwin. ``You go to 
people's homes now and they might have three or four television 
sets on the wall. It has created a whole different home 
entertainment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pick a trend in sports over the past two decades, and it's  
likely ESPN played a part: the booming popularity of the NCAA's 
March madness, the stratosphere of athletes' salaries, the 
explosion in fees paid to leagues for broadcast rights. 
</P>
<P>
	``ESPN has been great for college basketball,'' says Fresno  
State coach Jerry Tarkanian. ``The great popularity of the game is 
due to ESPN and (commentator) Dick Vitale.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Butch Davis, a football coach at the University of Miami, says  
ESPN has similarly helped his sport -- maybe too much. Sometimes, he 
complains, fans are so seduced by all the games on TV that they 
don't bother driving to the Orange Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	ESPN has ``brought another dimension to the intensity of the  
game: the quality of the exposure,'' says Penn State football coach 
Joe Paterno. ``It's not one or two days, it's ongoing. It's a big 
happening when they come on campus. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's put a lot of pressure on coaches and kids,'' he adds.  
``There's a little more than maybe some kids can handle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Berman cannot recall which nickname he announced first on  
``SportsCenter'': Frank Tanana ``Daiquiri''? John Mayberry ``RFD''? 
Hundreds followed, but it was on a baseball field that he realized 
just how deeply his comic signature had registered. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1982, Berman hovered near the batting cage, watching the  
Kansas City Royals prepare for a pivotal late-season game with the 
California Angels, when third base star George Brett approached. 
The Royals were concerned, Brett said, that they didn't have as 
many nicknames as other teams. Teammate Willie Wilson voiced the 
same complaint. So did U.L. Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonplussed but proud, Berman wondered: Shouldn't they be more  
worried about the pennant race? 
</P>
<P>
	``SportsCenter'' is ESPN's showcase, airing several times a day.  
From the beginning, comedy was as constant as film clips. Anchors 
Berman, Dan Patrick, the late Tom Mees, Keith Olbermann and others 
have always been quick with a wisecrack, or a snide aside. 
</P>
<P>
	It served as a model for ABC's ``Sports Night,'' a highly  
regarded sitcom entering its second season. The annual Espy Awards 
is the ``SportsCenter'' to the extreme, with athletes like baseball 
slugger Mark McGwire and anchors in tuxedos celebrating what looks 
good on TV. ESPN has effectively expanded the reach of its credo: 
Sports news isn't just news. It's entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
	``They keep it fun,'' says Brian Jordan, an outfielder for the  
Atlanta Braves. ``They're always laughing and enjoying themselves. 
That's what people like to see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	ESPN anchors try to have fun with sports, since that's why fans  
are fans. ``We talk with people,'' Berman says, ``not at them or 
down to them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dick Trickle values his ``SportsCenter'' joke. Patrick  
effectively adopted the NASCAR driver, mentioning where Trickle 
finished every time ESPN reported on a stock car race. It's not 
clear why, except that Trickle's name could guarantee a snicker 
among teen-age viewers. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearing 60, Trickle has heard sophomoric jokes since he was a  
kid. The journeyman driver doesn't mind ESPN's humor, especially 
when he considers what it's done for his career. 
</P>
<P>
	He never has to worry about attracting sponsors, and his fan  
club is nearly as big as circuit star Jeff Gordon's. ESPN, he says, 
``has made me one of the most popular drivers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Phil Mushnick, a columnist for the New York Post, considers ESPN  
humor a marketing strategy. ``It sometimes seems that the hearts 
and minds of the people they want to capture is in an 18- or 
19-year-old male, wearing a Motley Crue T-shirt, probably hung 
over, living in his parents' basement with a half-eaten pizza in a 
box on the floor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He isn't the only one who doesn't appreciate the humor. Last  
winter, the Major League Baseball Players Association asked ESPN 
executives to meet with offended players. 
</P>
<P>
	``They make jokes out of everybody's mistakes,'' says Tony  
Womack, an outfielder for the Arizona Diamondbacks. ``I don't like 
the criticism and the sarcasm from people who have never played at 
this level.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Failed ``SportsCenter'' jokes are easy to wave off. Just ignore  
ESPN's recent ``Which Bear Project,'' a spoof of the Chicago Bears' 
search for a quarterback that spun off the hit film, ``The Blair 
Witch Project.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What is harder to overlook are the legions of ESPN imitators on  
local TV and radio stations who deliver sports with a healthy 
helping of smugness and smarm. 
</P>
<P>
	A recent survey of broadcast journalism students at Syracuse,  
Missouri, Columbia and Ohio universities found that half of the men 
enrolled aspire to be sportscasters. Most list ESPN as the place 
they'd like to work. 
</P>
<P>
	That's one reason why often twice as many women as men apply for  
local TV news jobs, says Chris Tuohey, a broadcast professor at 
Syracuse who explains the frustration of his colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of students do the sports reports on their student  
newscasts in the ESPN style,'' he says. ``They are more interested 
in being funny and using sports lingo than they are in doing local 
feature pieces. They don't understand that there's no market in 
local television news for the ESPN style.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, there's been a backlash among TV news directors against  
this style, says John Quarderer, a vice president at the 
broadcasting research firm of Frank Magid and Associates. They 
figure viewers who want humor and highlights will watch 
``SportsCenter,'' so it's better to fill local sports reports with 
local news. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who try to appropriate the network's style forget that  
humor should come second to information, ESPN's Berman says. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if they're imitating us or if they're just trying  
to be noticed,'' he says. ``It's like a bad sports coat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	A Little League player smacks a long drive toward the left-field  
fence. He stands in the batter's box, twirling his bat, admiring 
his work. When the ball bounces off the fence instead of sailing 
over it, he's caught flat-footed -- and thrown out at second base. 
</P>
<P>
	A witness to the scene, Mushnick knew where he saw that  
posturing before. On TV. On ``SportsCenter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another time, he watched as kids in a pickup football game got  
in only a few plays before they abandoned it to practice the 
end-zone spikes they'd do if they scored a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
	Style over substance -- a pervasive effect that some critics  
blame on years of ``SportsCenter'' clips that emphasize the 
colorful more than the competent. What message gets through if 
taunting gets more attention than teamwork? 
</P>
<P>
	Youngsters see hitters hang back at the plate to admire their  
home runs and hear ``SportsCenter'' anchors note how the star 
wields his ``whipping stick.'' Their coach may say it's important 
to run hard to first base, but TV shows the home-run trot. 
</P>
<P>
	Basketball purists claim the fundamentals are deteriorating;  
shooting is slipping, scoring is down. Some coaches, like Indiana's 
Bob Knight, point to ESPN, suggesting its infatuation with the slam 
dunk has fostered a culture of individual play, not teamwork. 
</P>
<P>
	ESPN's Berman is sensitive to the criticism and suggests ESPN  
may have erred in celebrating excessive displays after dunks or 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	``It does go a little too far, which is why the NFL has put a  
flag on it,'' he concedes. ``After a while, we realized we should 
have a flag on it, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves' Jordan doesn't believe athletes alter their style of  
play to get on ESPN, but he knows many relish the chance to get on 
TV. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm always trying to make something happen so I can see myself  
on `SportsCenter,' as long as it's something good,'' the slugging 
outfielder says. ``If you do something bad, you're definitely going 
to be on there. And those guys can make you look pretty bad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even then, ESPN may be irresistible. A disgruntled Emmitt Smith,  
running back for the Dallas Cowboys, watches ``SportsCenter'' 
twice, sometimes three times, a day. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only time they show the Cowboys is when we do something  
wrong or we get smoked out by a team,'' he grouses. 
</P>
<P>
	But still he tunes in.  
</P>
<P>
	``Oh, yeah,'' he says. ``I'm gonna watch it.''  
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty years. In real life, just out of adolescence. In  
television terms, ESPN is the geeky kid who wouldn't leave his room 
yet emerged as an Internet millionaire. 
</P>
<P>
	Rasmussen couldn't save the Whalers. But, day after day, he's  
reminded of ESPN when he hears the mechanics at a gas station 
talking about Chris Berman or passes by TV monitors in sports 
stadiums. ``You had something to do with that, didn't you, 
Pop-Pop,'' his grandson will say. 
</P>
<P>
	Barry Larkin, a veteran shortstop for the Cincinnati Reds, can  
recall a time before ESPN when he thinks about its influence. 
</P>
<P>
	``Before, there was only a limited amount of time on network  
news devoted to sports,'' he says. ``ESPN was a vehicle that 
allowed more people to watch sports and, in turn, sports became 
more popular. Not just baseball, but all sports.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Larkin looks to his 6-year-old son, DeShane, for confirmation.  
</P>
<P>
	``He wouldn't have known anything about hockey before  
`SportsCenter,''' he says. ``Now, he wants to be a hockey player.''

<HEADLINE> Picking All-Century Team Isn't Easy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	When major league baseball and its marketing partners began  
their Team of the Century promotion, it seemed like a dandy idea. 
</P>
<P>
	Then the ballot arrived, crammed with 100 of the greatest  
players in history, all of whom are or should be in the Hall of 
Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	The challenge: Pick a 25-man roster.  
</P>
<P>
	The question: Who gets left out?  
</P>
<P>
	As if pennant races and wild card chases aren't tough enough,  
now baseball wants fans to separate Cochrane from Bench, Cobb from 
Mays, Ruth from Aaron. 
</P>
<P>
	This is like picking between a Model-T Ford and a Lexus LS 400.  
Each is special in its own time. 
</P>
<P>
	A better idea, certainly a more equitable one, might be to  
divide the century in half, to let players compete against those of 
their own era. 
</P>
<P>
	``I totally agree with that,'' said Ernie Banks, a candidate at  
shortstop. ``They're different times, different eras. We shouldn't 
all be lumped together. It's different generations of the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Banks' situation is typical. He is sandwiched at shortstop  
between old-timers Joe Cronin and Honus Wagner and moderns Ozzie 
Smith and Cal Ripken Jr. In his time, Banks was the best in the 
business with 512 home runs. But his time was not the same as that 
of those other players. 
</P>
<P>
	``The game has changed so much,'' he said. ``It's different  
technology, different balls. It's a different world. It's not that 
one generation is better than the other. It's just that one is 
different from the other.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then there is the issue of the voters. Most people casting  
ballots on the Internet never saw Wagner or Cronin play and might 
not have seen Banks. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's why I wear a cap with my name on it,'' Mr. Cub said.  
</P>
<P>
	The half-century solution wouldn't help much at third base where  
the ballot lists six candidates, old-timer Pie Traynor and moderns 
George Brett, Paul Molitor, Eddie Mathews, Mike Schmidt and Brooks 
Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
	Put Traynor in the early era team. Now whom do you vote for?  
Like a 3,000-hit guy? Which one, Brett or Molitor? Prefer 500 home 
runs? Which one, Schmidt or Mathews? Defense? Robinson won 16 Gold 
Gloves. 
</P>
<P>
	What do you do?  
</P>
<P>
	``You tell me,'' Brett said. ``It's a dilemma. It's like the  
All-Star balloting every year. Is there a right way? I doubt it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What Brett knows is the moderns have an edge.  
</P>
<P>
	``I heard about Pie Traynor but I never saw him,'' he said.  
``You remember what you see more than what you hear.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The All-Century promotion allows voters to pick six pitchers -- a  
slim staff in view of the current five-man rotation. Start with Cy 
Young and his 511 victories and Nolan Ryan with his seven 
no-hitters and 5,714 strikeouts. Then supplement them with, oh, 
perhaps Christy Mathewson, who won 20 or more games 13 times, and 
Walter Johnson, a 416-game winner. 
</P>
<P>
	Careful, now. That's four of six and no left-handers, yet.  
Voters are asked to pick at least one southpaw. So, which one? 
Warren Spahn with 363 victories or Sandy Koufax with three 
no-hitters and an 0.95 ERA in 57 World Series innings? Carl Hubbell 
with five straight 20-win seasons or Lefty Grove, a 300-game 
winner? 
</P>
<P>
	Want all four? No good. That would make eight pitchers, two over  
the limit. And it doesn't even account for worthy candidates like 
Tom Seaver and Dizzy Dean -- and in case you're looking for a relief 
pitcher -- Rollie Fingers or Dennis Eckersley. 
</P>
<P>
	Outfielders might be the toughest department. They allow nine.  
Twice that might not be enough. 
</P>
<P>
	If you start with Aaron and his 755 home runs in right field,  
does that mean leaving out Ruth and his 714? If you want Cobb and 
his 4,191 hits in center field, what about Mays and his 660 homers? 
Prefer Ted Williams, the last .400 hitter in left? Then what about 
Lou Brock and his 3,023 hits and 938 stolen bases? 
</P>
<P>
	Take all six and there are just three places left to pick from  
the likes of Joe DiMaggio, Mickey Mantle, Shoeless Joe Jackson, 
Hack Wilson, Joe Medwick and Carl Yastrzemski. 
</P>
<P>
	You get just three of them and look who's still left out.  
</P>
<P>
	No room for Clemente?  
</P>
<P>
	What about Musial and Speaker and Junior Griffey?  
</P>
<P>
	And by the way, there is this fellow named Rose, who had more  
hits than any of them. 
</P>
<P>
	So, it's clear this task is impossible. There is a simple  
solution, though. The dividing line should be uniforms -- flannels 
vs. flannels and double knits vs. double knits. Pick a pair of 
teams, one from then, one from now. 
</P>
<P>
	``And then,'' Banks said, ``let's play two.''

<HEADLINE> Sen. Harkin Decides To Endorse Gore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- U.S. Sen. Tom Harkin has decided to  
endorse Vice President Al Gore's bid for the Democratic 
presidential nomination and will announce his decision Monday, 
senior Democratic officials told The Associated Press Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Harkin has scheduled a series of appearances with Gore on Labor  
Day and will formally endorse him at that time, said the officials, 
who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	``You'll be hearing from Tom about his long history with the  
vice president,'' said one official. 
</P>
<P>
	Harkin and Gore will attend Labor Day events in Des Moines,  
Cedar Rapids and Dubuque, three cities where organized labor has 
the highest profile in the state where precinct caucuses launch the 
presidential nominating season. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore is getting a challenge from former New Jersey Sen. Bill  
Bradley for the nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	While Bradley's challenge is significant, Harkin decision is  
still one more example of the difficulty Bradley faces in trying to 
pry major pieces of the Democratic establishment away from a 
sitting vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	Harkin sought the Democratic nomination himself in 1992, but  
quickly faded. After dropping, he quickly endorsed then-candidate 
Bill Clinton and developed close ties to the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	That was expanded to include Gore, and the two have been close  
personally and politically. 
</P>
<P>
	The endorsement is good new for Gore for a couple of other  
reasons. Harkin is one of the most successful politicians in either 
party in Iowa. He first won election to Congress in 1974, and 
served for 10 years before knocking off a sitting Republican U.S. 
Senator.

<HEADLINE>  Angry French Farmers Protest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MARSEILLE, France (AP) -- Hundreds of angry farmers protesting  
American trade muscle and economic globalization bombarded riot 
police with apples on Saturday in this Mediterranean port city, the 
latest demonstration in two weeks of protests. 
</P>
<P>
	Security forces lobbed tear gas to stop the volley of apples  
thrown by 500 fruit and vegetable farmers armed with shopping carts 
from the Carrefour grocery store chain. 
</P>
<P>
	In a simultaneous protest, up to 200 protesting farmers, with  
cows, geese, pigs and a horses in tow, gathered in the Normandy 
town of Deauville, where the yearly American Film Festival was 
underway. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Americans came to help us 50 years ago,'' said Hilaire  
Taillecours, 62, from the Plateau du Neubourg in Normandy. ``But 
that doesn't mean they can tell us what to eat and how to film.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Taillecours raises cows and grows wheat and red beats on his  
125-acre farm. 
</P>
<P>
	His complaint reflected the expanding nature of the protest,  
which initially protested U.S. sanctions on a slew of products 
ranging from Roquefort cheese to foie gras. It has since expanded 
to include everything that symbolizes American ``hegemony'' in 
trade and agriculture, and globalization. 
</P>
<P>
	The protesters are all members of the radical agricultural  
union, the Farmers' Confederation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Globalization is creating absurd economic conflicts,'' the  
union said in an earlier statement. The aim of their protests is to 
``allow farmers and others to feed themselves as they think best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The farmers initially targeted McDonald's France as a symbol of  
globalization, landing union leader Jose Bove and four others in 
jail on Aug. 19 after a McDonald's construction site in the 
southern town of Millau was vandalized. 
</P>
<P>
	The imprisoned sheep farmer has quickly become a cause celebre  
of the movement, with offers from around France, and even from 
American farm groups, to pay his $17,000. McDonald's France dropped 
its damages claim against Bove, who refused a court offer to free 
him from jail last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Bove's lawyer, Francois Roux, said Friday that his client might  
go free by Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Jets' Chrebet Has Foot Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. (AP) -- New York Jets receiver Wayne Chrebet  
underwent successful surgery on his left foot Saturday as doctors 
placed a screw in the foot to speed up the healing. 
</P>
<P>
	Chrebet was injured without being touched on a first quarter  
pass play in Friday night's 38-17 preseason victory over Minnesota. 
He is expected to be sidelined for six weeks after not missing a 
game for his first four NFL seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``As he turned up the field, he started limping,'' coach Bill  
Parcells said. ``It wasn't involved with anything where he was 
trying to make a defensive back do anything. What are you going to 
do? 
</P>
<P>
	``They put a screw in his foot. I'm glad they did that. It  
usually enhances the healing process and helps get the player back 
quicker. '' 
</P>
<P>
	Parcells didn't blame the Giants Stadium carpet for the injury.  
It was the first preseason game played on the artificial surface 
after the grass was taken out Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``A turf injury? I don't think so,'' Parcells said.  
</P>
<P>
	Chrebet, who made the team as an undrafted free agent in 1995,  
is part of a strong receiver corps that also features Pro Bowler 
Keyshawn Johnson, emerging third-year speedster Dedric Ward, and 
veterans Quinn Early and Dwight Stone, both added as free agents 
this summer. Ward will take over starting duties, and he is more a 
deep threat than Chrebet, who is one of the premier third-down 
receivers in the league. 
</P>
<P>
	``Each guy that is playing in this league that is a productive  
player has his unique ability,'' Parcells said, ``and you try to 
use those abilities to allow him to be successful in the things he 
does well. I can't go looking to find another Wayne Chrebet. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have confidence in Dedric. He is a different receiver than  
Wayne, and I won't be asking him to do things I would ask Wayne to 
do all the time. He has some things to do that Wayne can't do. '' 
</P>
<P>
	Parcells made adding depth to the receiver position a summer  
priority. He succeeded by signing Early, a 12-year veteran, and 
Stone, who is in his 13th season. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, they will come in handy.  
</P>
<P>
	``I told you all along I was concerned about where we were at  
the receiver position, even though the quality we had was good,'' 
Parcells said. ``That was obviously a genuine statement and I tried 
to do something about it before it was absolutely necessary that we 
did. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know how this is going to work out, but right now I'm  
glad they are here. If they weren't, we would really be in 
trouble.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Has Confidence in Reno </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	THURMONT, Md. (AP) -- Amid serious questions over the role of  
federal law enforcement agencies in the 1993 Waco siege, President 
Clinton said Saturday he has confidence in Attorney General Janet 
Reno, but stopped short of saying the same for FBI Director Louis 
Freeh. 
</P>
<P>
	Summoning reporters to the presidential retreat at Camp David,  
Md., to speak about Mideast peace developments, Clinton was asked 
if he had confidence in Reno and Freeh. 
</P>
<P>
	``Well I certainly have in the Attorney General. You know she  
told us what happened. She told us she asked the right questions 
and didn't get the right answers,'' said Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	As for Freeh, while not casting blame, Clinton remained  
reserved. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that with regard to the director there is going to be  
an independent investigation which she supports and which he has 
said he supports,'' Clinton said. ``I don't think it serves any 
purpose to assign blame until the investigation is concluded and 
the evidence is in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said he thought Freeh ``did the right thing in saying  
that there ought to be an independent investigation and I think 
that is all we can ask of him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI admitted last week that combustible tear gas was used in  
the Waco siege, reversing six years of statements to the contrary. 
Reno ordered an investigation to ``get to the bottom'' of why her 
orders to use only non-burning tear gas were ignored at Waco, which 
ended with a fire and the deaths of cult leader David Koresh and 
about 80 of his followers. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, a congressman says investigators are reviewing  
footage obtained by a Colorado filmmaker to see if it shows U.S. 
armed forces firing into Koresh's compound at the close of the Waco 
standoff. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have those tapes and have given them to two experts to  
analyze,'' Rep. Dan Burton, chairman of the House Government Reform 
Committee, said Friday. ``Two separate entities are looking at them 
frame-by-frame.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He refused to disclose what individuals are reviewing the film.  
</P>
<P>
	Filmmaker Mike McNulty said he obtained the infrared film, taken  
by an FBI surveillance aircraft at about 9,000 feet, through the 
Freedom of Information Act. 
</P>
<P>
	McNulty claimed to participants at a Republican retreat Friday  
that his footage indicates that the Army's secretive Delta Forces 
fired at least 60 rounds into Koresh's compound 51 days after the 
siege started on Feb. 28, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Pentagon officials have said three Army special forces officers  
were at the scene, but were there only as observers. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the New York Times reported that observers from the  
Pentagon's Special Operations Command were sent to the Davidian 
compound more than a month before the fire. 
</P>
<P>
	Declassifed government documents also showed that top Defense  
Department officials were briefed by the command about the Waco 
situation. FBI spokesman John Collingwood told the Times that the 
Defense Department played no operational role at Waco, however. 
</P>
<P>
	Only under tightly prescribed rules is the military allowed to  
participate in domestic law enforcement operations. 
</P>
<P>
	If it turns out that military forces did open fire without  
proper authorization, ``then those who did it will and should be 
prosecuted,'' said Burton. 
</P>
<P>
	In Texas, a federal judge handling a lawsuit brought by  
survivors of the siege was forced to intervene after federal agents 
tried to keep Texas Rangers from entering a Waco storage facility 
to search for evidence, the Dallas Morning News reported in 
Saturday's editions. 
</P>
<P>
	Agents with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms assigned  
to maintain custody of a storage locker containing evidence 
recovered from Koresh's compound reportedly told the Rangers that 
their lawyers in Washington had ordered them to deny the Rangers 
entry, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Law enforcement officials in Texas, speaking on the condition of  
anonymity, told the newspaper that the Rangers were allowed to 
search boxes only after U.S. District Judge Walter Smith was 
called. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rangers were looking for a spent pyrotechnic device that was  
photographed in 1993 by investigators at the Branch Davidian 
compound. Texas officials said they did not find the missing round 
at the storage locker.

<HEADLINE> Castro Wants Probe of Pan Am Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAVANA (AP) -- President Fidel Castro said Saturday that Cuba  
will continue to compete in the Pan Am Games and other 
international events even though he is suspicious of drug tests 
flunked by his country's athetes. 
</P>
<P>
	Castro is demanding an investigation of the tests.  
</P>
<P>
	``We are not breaking with any institution,'' the Cuban  
president said toward the end of the second and last televised 
hearing on the drug issue, which continued into early Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Castro said that Pan American Sports Organization president  
Mario Vazquez Rana had expressed interest in Cuba's demand for an 
investigation. Vazquez Rana had no immediate public comment, 
however, following Castro's public demands. 
</P>
<P>
	Castro said on Friday the IOC should look into the drug tests at  
the Pan Am Games last month and he demanded four Cuban athletes who 
tested positive for banned steroids get back their medals. 
</P>
<P>
	``And for much more,'' he said during his five-hour televised  
speech. ``To return the honor of these scorned athletes. We will 
not rest until it is achieved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Castro asked that IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch form a  
commission to follow up on Cuba's charges of irregularities in drug 
tests given to world champion high jumper Javier Sotomayor and 
three weight lifting medal winners at the games in Winnipeg, 
Alberta. 
</P>
<P>
	Castro said the gold medals taken from Sotomayor and weight  
lifters William Vargas and Rolando Delgado, and the silver medal 
stripped from weight lifter Modesto Sanchez should be returned. 
</P>
<P>
	Sotomayor tested positive for cocaine.  
</P>
<P>
	Castro also wants the commission to look into disputed bouts at  
the International Amateur Boxing Association Championships last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	After one one match, the association suspended four judges for  
irregularities after giving a Russian fighter a victory over a 
Cuban. The decision was reversed and the Cuban was given the gold 
medal. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday night, Castro, along with a leading sports official  
and a top sports doctor, said that multiple urine tests on the 
weight lifters conducted by Cuba and sent to three different 
laboratories in Europe all failed to show the steroid Nandrolone. 
The tests were conducted four-to-five days after the athletes 
returned to Cuba from the Pan Am Games, Castro said. 
</P>
<P>
	Steroids are injected into the body to increase strength and  
bulk and can remain in a person's system for months. 
</P>
<P>
	Not a single athlete in our weight lifting team was using  
drugs,'' Castro said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the case of Sotomayor, it would be ``absurd'' to believe that  
Sotomayor took cocaine before he won his fourth straight gold 
medal, because the large quantity found in his system would have 
impeded his performance, Castro said. 
</P>
<P>
	He suggested that new tests could be conducted on the  
weightlifters if necessary because steroids remain in the system. 
After one reporter said that tests on a person's hair could 
determine cocaine use, but Castro said he was unwilling to require 
Sotomayor to go through any more tests. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be undignified to submit Sotomayor to these types of  
tests,'' Castro said. ``That would have to be decided by 
Sotomayor.''

<HEADLINE>  Romanowski Issues Apology on Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Denver Broncos linebacker Bill Romanowski, under  
investigation for obtaining a prescription drug through fraud, 
issued an apology after Friday night's exhibition game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't talk about any of that right now,'' Romanowski said,  
``but I apologize to my teammates, the organization and all the 
fans that support me. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully, this won't affect me. Hopefully, somehow and some  
way I can get through this, that I can be ready to play next 
week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He called the Broncos' 34-3 victory over San Francisco ``very  
much of a good break. Whenever I can go out on the field and do 
what I love to do, I have the passion for the game. It was nice. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wasn't distracted. Once I took the field I was ready to  
play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Romanowski's coach, Mike Shanahan, said he has known about the  
potential legal problems for several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just disappointed it all came out without going to the  
D.A. first,'' Shanahan said. ``People will eventually see that this 
is not a serious deal. I'll be surprised if there ever is a charge. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew about it around three weeks ago, maybe a month ago.  
We'll just have to let the courts do their job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Romanowski could be charged with felony counts of fraud and  
deceit and conspiracy, and a misdemeanor charge of unlawful use of 
a controlled substance. 
</P>
<P>
	Douglas County sheriff's officials said Romanowski's wife,  
Julie, and another woman allegedly obtained bogus prescriptions 
from a doctor for the drug Phentermine and gave it to Romanowski 
for his personal use. 
</P>
<P>
	The drug is an appetite suppressant but also acts as a  
stimulant.

<P>
	DEL MAR, Calif. (AP) -- Tuzla edged Happyanunoit by a head in a  
four-horse blanket finish to win Saturday's $400,000 Ramona 
Handicap and give trainer Bob Baffert a sweep of Del Mar's five 
Grade I stakes this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Ridden by David Flores, Tuzla covered 1 1/8 miles on the turf in  
1:47 3-5, only one-fifth of a second off the stakes record set by 
See You Soon last year. The French-bred paid $10.80, $5.60 and 
$4.40. 
</P>
<P>
	Happyanunoit returned $12 and $7.60, while Spanish Fern was  
another head back in third and paid $7.20 to show. Que Belle was a 
head farther back in fourth. 
</P>
<P>
	Baffert's sweep of Del Mar's Grade I stakes includes the Eddie  
Read Handicap with Joe Who, the Del Mar Oaks with Tout Charmant, 
the Pacific Classic with General Challenge and the Del Mar 
Debutante with Chilukki. 
</P>
<P>
	Flores rode all of the Grade I winners trained by Baffert,  
except for Joe Who, who was ridden by Chris Antley.

	TORRANCE, Calif. (AP) -- An armed robber took $500 and two  
bottles of Viagra from a pharmacy. 
</P>
<P>
	The man walked into the Walgreen's Pharmacy, in this city south  
of downtown Los Angeles, on Friday and pulled a gun on three 
employees, demanding the money and the male anti-impotency drug, 
said Lt. Gil Kranke. 
</P>
<P>
	Each bottle contained 30 tablets. Each pill sells for about $10.  
</P>
<P>
	Police believe the robber, described as a young man in his 20s,  
was likely planning to sell the drugs on the black market rather 
than use them himself. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was pretty young to be needing something like that,''

<HEADLINE> Report: 7 Fishermen Die Off Baja </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Seven fishermen died when a fishing boat sank  
while casting its nets for sardines off the Baja California coast, 
local media reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The boat, which had a nine-man crew, sank late Thursday in the  
Pacific about 140 miles south of Tijuana, the newspaper El 
Universal reported. 
</P>
<P>
	One crew member, Gilberto Salgado, 48, was found alive on a  
beach near the town of Vicente Guerrero after he apparently swam 1 
1/2 miles to shore from where the Propemex G2 went down. Salgado 
told police that six crew members apparently became entangled in 
fishing nets and went down with the boat. 
</P>
<P>
	The seventh fatality was the boat's captain, who clung to a  
floating board and was picked up by another fishing boat. He died 
shortly afterward but the exact cause of death wasn't immediately 
clear. 
</P>
<P>
	The only other survivor was a crew member who was picked up  
along with the captain. He was taken to San Quintin, about 25 miles 
south of the accident site, for medical treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	Navy vessels were dispatched to search for possible survivors.  
It was unclear what caused the accident.

<HEADLINE> Former Bookmaker Back in Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKLIN, Ohio (AP) -- The man who said he was Pete Rose's  
bookmaker has pleaded innocent to a charge of telephone harassment, 
just a few days after he was arrested on charges that include 
assaulting a police officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Ron Peters, 42, entered his innocent plea to the telephone  
harassment charge on Friday in Franklin Municipal Court. He is 
accused of making harassing phone calls to his ex-wife's husband, 
Ryan McCurley of Franklin. 
</P>
<P>
	Peters told Judge David Rupert that he called McCurley's house  
to speak to his daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	Peters already is scheduled for trial Sept. 29 in Franklin on an  
aggravated menacing charge filed in April that involved alleged 
threats to McCurley. 
</P>
<P>
	Peters has been held at the Warren County Jail in Lebanon, about  
25 miles north of Cincinnati, on a $50,000 bond since an arrest 
Tuesday. Peters is accused of elbowing a Springboro police officer 
who stopped his car after it was seen weaving on the road about 3 
a.m. Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said Peters then fled and was arrested about five hours  
later by a Warren County sheriff's deputy. In addition to the 
assault charge, Peters also was charged with driving under 
suspension, resisting arrest and falsification. 
</P>
<P>
	He is scheduled for a preliminary hearing Tuesday to determine  
whether the case should be sent to a grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
	Peters helped authorities build their case against Rose, saying  
the career hits leader bet on baseball, including the team he 
managed, the Cincinnati Reds. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose admitted betting through bookies, but denied placing bets  
on baseball. He later pleaded guilty to two felony counts of 
failing to report income from autograph appearances, baseball 
memorabilia sales and gambling. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose was banned from baseball in August 1989.  
</P>
<P>
	Peters served concurrent two-year sentences at a federal prison  
in Terre Haute, Ind., for tax and drug trafficking convictions.

<HEADLINE> Detroit Teachers May Face Pay Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Michigan lawmakers could threaten Detroit  
teachers with the loss of one day's pay for every day they strike. 
</P>
<P>
	The teacher walk-out already has delayed the start of classes by  
a week, and negotiations continuing into the weekend showed little 
progress Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously there's a lot of things we can do. I think we can  
make sure they're penalized,'' Senate Majority Leader Dan DeGrow, 
R-Port Huron, told the Detroit Free Press in Saturday's editions. 
If necessary, legislators will be called back next week to force an 
end to the strike, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll be in court with an injunction in a second,'' teachers'  
attorney George Washington shot back Saturday as negotiators for 
the district and teachers' union continued contract talks. 
</P>
<P>
	The teachers' contract expired June 30. The strike began after a  
two-month extention ran out Monday -- one day before classes in the 
172,000-student district were scheduled to begin. 
</P>
<P>
	The Detroit strike is the first test of a 1994 state law that  
increased penalties for teacher walk-outs. 
</P>
<P>
	David Adamany, the school district's interim chief executive,  
said lawmakers likely will decide to fine teachers one day's pay 
for each day they strike. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he wasn't optimistic about a deal being reached in time  
to open school immediately after Labor Day, as Detroit Mayor Dennis 
Archer had hoped. The mayor even offered his own office for 
around-the-clock bargaining, but the teachers' union declined the 
offer. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday's evening, Jim Amar -- the state mediator appointed Aug.  
24 -- said only that both sides were ``still hammering away, but 
it's tough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no question that if the matter is not resolved, other  
parties will take action,'' Amar said. He declined to elaborate on 
which points of the contract have yet to be resolved. Among the top 
issues for teachers are merit pay and class sizes. 
</P>
<P>
	Teachers have won at least one concession -- the withdrawl of a  
district proposal to extend the school day by 2 hours, to 8 1/2 hours. 
In return, teachers would not oppose having non-teaching personnel 
work longer days so the district could offer after-school programs.

<HEADLINE> NC State Wrestler Found Innocent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- A jury found a former North Carolina State  
wrestler innocent of involuntary manslaughter Friday but guilty of 
breaking and entering the house of another student who had fired a 
gun into an off-campus party. 
</P>
<P>
	Clyde ``Billy'' Blunt, 20, faced the most serious charge levied  
against 10 former N.C. State athletes involved in an incident last 
November which ended in the death of Neil Davis Jr. at Davis' home 
last November. Davis, 21, of Fayetteville, died of a gunshot wound 
after his 9 mm handgun discharged during a melee. 
</P>
<P>
	Blunt remained subdued as the jury's verdict was read after  
about four hours of deliberation. His mother wept on her husband's 
shoulder. Blunt and his attorney declined comment until after Wake 
County Superior Court Judge Ronald Stephens imposes a sentence for 
the misdemeanor conviction Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis' mother left the courtroom without speaking to reporters.  
</P>
<P>
	Davis had fired repeatedly toward the loud party across the  
street from his home Nov. 22. One slug fragment struck another N.C. 
State wrestler, slightly injuring him. That prompted seven angry 
partygoers to storm Davis' house and beat him before the gun 
discharged. 
</P>
<P>
	Blunt testified Wednesday he was only trying to keep someone  
else from being shot when he and other partygoers entered the home. 
Blunt said that he found Davis holding a pistol with both hands 
pointed directly at him. Blunt grabbed the gun with one hand and 
shoved Davis onto the bed, he testified. The gun went off as the 
struggle continued, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Blunt's defense lawyers claimed his acts were lawful because he  
tried to detain someone he believed had committed unlawful acts. 
</P>
<P>
	But Assistant District Attorney Doug Faucette challenged Blunt's  
credibility, suggesting it was unbelievable that Blunt was only 
trying to disarm Davis. He pointed out that once the pistol 
discharged during the struggle, Blunt claimed he suddenly decided 
to leave without knowing where the gun was or without knowing that 
Davis had been shot. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight athletes were disciplined for their roles in the fracas  
and shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	Three football team members were dismissed and their  
scholarships revoked. Two wrestling team members and three gymnasts 
were barred from team activities. 
</P>
<P>
	Blunt, of Modesto, Calif., was the defending ACC heavyweight  
champion. A California and national champion at the high school 
level, Blunt was considered to be an Olympic prospect after his 
college graduation.

	Blunt's attorneys concluded their case Thursday with a string of  
character witnesses, including U.S. women's soccer team player 
Tisha Venturini, who flew from her home in Newport Beach, Calif., 
to testify. The former University of North Carolina soccer star 
grew up playing sports with Blunt's sister in Modesto, Calif.

breaking and entering in June. Campenella and Mordarski will be 
sentenced after Blunt's trial.

	Willie Kinte Wright of Greensboro, was charged with felony  
larceny of a firearm and is waiting for a trial to be scheduled. 
Wright rejoined the Wolfpack football team as a walk-on this summer

	Harold Jackson, a second-string fullback from Wilkes-Barre, Pa.,  
and David Stringer, a wide receiver from North Brunswick, N.J., 
pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges of breaking and entering and 
accessory to theft of a firearm. They were put on probation for two 
years and ordered to perform 200 hours of community service.

<HEADLINE> S. Williams Survives at U.S. Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Her father was saying it all week -- Serena  
Williams is destined to make up half of the U.S. Open women's 
final. 
</P>
<P>
	That date with sister Venus came close to being canceled  
Saturday by another precocious teen -- 16-year-old Belgian Kim 
Clijsters -- until Serena strung together 14 straight points, and 
won 16 of the last 17, to salvage a 4-6, 6-2, 7-5 victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, 17, refused to give in as Clijsters served for the  
match at 5-3. Williams broke her at love, drilled four big serves 
to hold at love, then broke Clijsters at love again before putting 
it away to match her best Grand Slam result, a fourth-round 
appearance at the 1998 French Open. 
</P>
<P>
	The No. 7 seeded Williams came in with more muscle and more  
hype, but made a slew of mistakes against an opponent who was 
unfazed by the Williams mystique. Clijsters, No. 98, put Williams 
on notice in the first set with an array of stinging winners that 
impressed the crowd and punctured Williams' pride. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was playing great,'' Williams said of Clijsters' early  
effort. ``She doesn't have any weak shots. She does a lot of things 
very well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams found herself down 0-2 in the second set before she  
began to match Clijsters' shots. Williams reduced her unforced 
errors from 27 in the first set to five in the second. 
</P>
<P>
	In the final set, overconfidence burdened Williams again while  
Clijsters regained control. By outslugging Williams at the baseline 
and taking advantage of Williams' three double-faults, Clijsters 
had a chance to close out the match on serve at 5-3. 
</P>
<P>
	It looked like another quick Grand Slam exit for Williams, who  
lost in the third rounds of the Australian and the French this 
year. But Clijsters served shakily, and Williams jumped on the 
opportunity with wicked returns. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's when my determination really kicked in,'' said  
Williams, who next meets No. 16 Conchita Martinez. ``I was really 
tired of going out early in the Slams.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clijsters regretted rushing at the wrong moment.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm always rushing,'' Clijsters said. ``She returned good and  
I had to put more first serves in. I was pushing myself. Maybe 
there was a little bit of pressure on me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was plenty of pressure on Williams also, who called the  
comeback her biggest in a major event. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was definitely pretty magnificent the way I was able to  
be determined and come back and just really stay focused like 
that,'' Williams said. ``I don't recall having done that before.''

	After Vote, Violence in East Timor  
</P>
<P>
	DILI, Indonesia (AP) -- Pro-Indonesia militiamen rampaged through  
East Timor's capital unchallenged Sunday, a day after the U.N. 
announced that residents overwhelmingly voted to break away from 
Indonesia and become independent. An American was wounded in the 
gunfire that erupted Saturday in the provincial capital of Dili and 
continued well into Sunday. Many feared the vote results could

accused of embezzling up to $915 million from seven insurance 
companies, was arrested Saturday in Germany. The arrest ended an 
international manhunt that lasted more than four months. Frankel, 
44, was apprehended without incident and charged with money 
laundering and wire fraud. Authorities in the United States issued 
an arrest warrant for Frankel on July 14. He has been missing since 
May 5, when a fire alarm alerted firefighters to an emergency at

apartment complexes today, injuring more than a dozen people and 
displacing as many as 1,000, authorities said. Another tornado 
earlier damaged a barn and snapped utility polls in nearby 
Chesapeake. A National Weather Service forecaster said the tornadic

	6 Die As Russian Officers' Apt. Is Bombed

	MAKHACHKALA, Russia (AP) -- An explosion destroyed a five-story  
apartment building housing military officers in southern Russia 
late Saturday, killing at least six people, injuring dozens and 
leaving 80 feared buried in the rubble, according to news reports. 
There was no word on the cause of the explosion in the town of 
Buinaksk, located in the Caucasus Mountains republic of Dagestan. 
But suspicion immediately fell on Islamic rebels: One group of 
rebels fought Russian troops for several weeks near the border with 
Chechnya last month, and others have been battling Russians for the

	Detroit Teachers' Pay May Be Cut

	DETROIT (AP) -- Michigan lawmakers could threaten Detroit  
teachers with the loss of one day's pay for every day they strike. 
David Adamany, the school district's interim chief executive, said 
lawmakers likely will decide to fine teachers one day's pay for 
each day they strike. He said he wasn't optimistic about a deal 
being reached in time to open school immediately after Labor Day, 
as Detroit Mayor Dennis Archer had hoped. This evening, Jim Amar -- 
the state mediator appointed Aug. 24 -- said only that both sides 
were ``still hammering away, but it's tough.''

Navy (0-1) forged an early 7-7 tie. Rogers ran for 72 yards and two 
scores to help Georgia Tech take a 28-7 halftime lead. Joe Hamilton

team made in February. The seven-time Pro Bowl tackle reported for 
practice today after accepting a one-year, $3.45 million tender. 
Webb had wanted a long-term contract up to $6 million per year, but 
he had limited leverage because the Dolphins designated him their 
franchise player last winter.

<HEADLINE> Tampa's Canseco Has Hand Injury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Tampa Bay Devil Rays designated  
hitter Jose Canseco could be sidelined up to five days by a hand 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Canseco has been slowed by a sore ligament near his little  
finger on the right hand. The problem first occurred when Canseco 
resumed batting practice while rehabbing after back surgery in 
July. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has bothered his swing, you can see it,'' Tampa Bay manager  
Larry Rothschild said before Saturday's game against the Minnesota 
Twins. ``We need to address that and hopefully get rid of it. I 
don't know how long it's going to take, it could be up to five 
days.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Canseco is hitting .324 (12-for-37) with nine RBIs in 11 games  
since he was activated from the disabled list on Aug. 20. All of 
the hits were singles. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want him to get where he is pain free and get to see him hit  
the ball out of the park again,'' Rothschild said. 
</P>
<P>
	Canseco hit 31 home runs before being placed on the DL on July  
10.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Slams GOP Tax Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Challenging the Republican Congress to wake  
from its ``summer slumber,'' President Clinton said Saturday the 
pending GOP $792 billion tax cut would imperil prosperity, put 
Social Security at risk and bar needed investments in education. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, in his weekly radio address, set out an action agenda  
for the fall congressional session which he said should focus on 
paying off the national debt, ensuring Social Security's viability, 
strengthening and improving Medicare, investing in new schools and 
more teachers and passing laws designed to keep guns out of the 
wrong hands. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't believe we should squander our surplus, after being in  
debt for 30 years and quadrupling our national debt in just 12,'' 
Clinton said. ``I don't think we should do something that would 
imperil our prosperity or jeopardize our children's future by 
forcing crippling cuts in Social Security and Medicare, by failing 
to seize this opportunity to get America out of debt for the first 
time since 1835.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republican House and Senate members have spent their summer  
recess pitching their 10-year tax cut plan to their constituents. 
It has been passed by both houses. Clinton, who proposes a far more 
modest tax cut, has promised to veto the GOP bill it if it reaches 
his desk. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can meet our most pressing national priorities and still  
have sensible tax cuts,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Republican radio response, Rep. John Hostettler, R-Ind.,  
said the tax-cut bill would just return, to those who earned it in 
the first place, ``a $3 trillion federal tax overpayment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If you overpaid a utility company, you wouldn't allow it to  
keep this overcharge, would you?'' Hostettler asked. ``You would 
demand and deserve a refund. ... If you overpay the government, it 
is only fair that you get a refund in the form of tax relief.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Over a decade, the Republican tax-cut plan would reduce all  
income tax rates by one percentage point, cut capital gains taxes, 
improve retirement savings, ease the ``marriage penalty'' paid by 
many two-income couples, gradually eliminate the alternative 
minimum tax, provide new breaks for education and health care and 
benefit large and small businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	But Clinton called the proposal unacceptably hazardous and said  
the prosperity achieved during his administration is the best 
argument against it. 
</P>
<P>
	He cited as new evidence Friday's report that the unemployment  
rate has dipped to a 29-year low of 4.2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now we must use this moment of great promise to meet our large  
long-term challenges,'' the president said. ``The risky tax plan 
passed by the majority in Congress ... would make it impossible to 
pursue these other objectives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also announced he has sent a letter to Republican  
leaders renewing his call for Congress to pass a juvenile crime 
bill that requires safety locks for guns and closes a ``gun show 
loophole'' that now allows for no-questions-asked purchases of some 
guns. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton reminded his radio audience nearly five months since the  
fatal shootings at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	``It shouldn't take another tragedy to shake them from the  
summer slumber.'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Congress, Clinton Face Decisions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- So far, the budget debate between Congress and  
President Clinton has dealt with rival political priorities, 
setting positions for their annual showdown. Now it gets down to 
real money, with real deadlines. 
</P>
<P>
	When Congress reconvenes Wednesday after its summer vacation,  
there will be little more than three weeks to act on the 
appropriations bills due before budget new year on Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	There are White House veto warnings against Republican spending  
cuts in programs the president prizes. When it gets to him, Clinton 
is committed to veto the $792 billion GOP tax cut, which probably 
wouldn't have passed in the first place had wavering moderates not 
known when they voted for it that the measure would not become law. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House would like to get on with that, and chief of  
staff John Podesta said he hopes Republican leaders will send it to 
Clinton quickly now. 
</P>
<P>
	``Please send us the tax cut bill so that we don't have to keep  
fooling around with the phony debate,'' Podesta said. ``Send it 
down to us so that we can veto it and then move forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While a tax cut may eventually be part of a budget compromise  
later this fall, it doesn't have to be enacted. The 13 
appropriations bills, or substitute spending resolutions, do, to 
keep the government financed. 
</P>
<P>
	Only one, the least controversial, for military construction,  
has been passed and signed into law. The appropriation to pay for 
the operations of Congress is ready for Clinton's signature. 
</P>
<P>
	The other 11, appropriating at least $20 billion less than the  
president seeks, are unfinished business. Six have passed both the 
House and Senate and await negotiations on final terms. 
</P>
<P>
	While Republican leaders had aimed at completing them all before  
the end of the month -- a deadline that has been met only three 
times -- that's not likely. And any vetoed appropriation couldn't be 
revived by Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	So they'll pass what they can, and fall back as usual on  
resolutions to continue the spending authority of agencies that 
don't have their appropriations when the old ones expire. 
</P>
<P>
	That was done in 1998, before the administration and Republican  
leaders negotiated a catchall appropriation bill that included more 
than $20 billion in additional spending to seal the deal. 
Conservatives called that a sellout, but the alternative was 
gridlock and the risk of agency shutdowns like those of late 1995, 
episodes that hurt the Republicans politically. 
</P>
<P>
	Podesta said that at this point, the White House is not planning  
on a budget summit to work it all out in a package plan. But he 
said that ultimately, the administration and congressional leaders 
``are going to have to sit down and try to work through this 
problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They're all saying that whatever the settlement, it will be for  
a balanced budget. But that may involve some creative bookkeeping. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1997 budget deal set spending limits that pose a dilemma.  
</P>
<P>
	Neither party wants to openly suggest raising them. Both know  
that they can't be enforced without unacceptable cuts in popular 
federal programs. The hedge is to designate appropriations as 
emergency spending, which avoids the limit. 
</P>
<P>
	But it is all money, and it already is adding up to more than  
the $14 billion surplus projected for 2000, not counting Social 
Security, which Republicans have voted to lock away, not to be 
tapped for current spending. 
</P>
<P>
	So the numbers don't fit.  
</P>
<P>
	The Senate approved $7.4 billion in emergency farm aid before  
the recess, and Rep. Tom Delay, the Texan who is GOP whip, called 
that an atomic bomb that blows up House strategy for guarding 
Social Security surpluses. 
</P>
<P>
	But the House produced its own emergency gimmicks, notably on  
funds for the 2000 census. That's nearly $4.5 billion, for the 
census the Constitution requires, labeled an emergency although the 
rules reserve that designation for sudden, unforeseen and 
unpredictable needs. 
</P>
<P>
	The reason the census appropriation was declared an emergency is  
that the 1997 budget agreement didn't anticipate it. ``Someone 
forgot to tell the White House and the Congress in 1997 that we 
would face this,'' Rep. Harold Rogers, R-Ky., said before the House 
voted to uphold the designation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Apparently I now understand the nature of the emergency,''  
taunted Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass. ``We forgot.''

<HEADLINE> Bradley, Gore Want Labor's Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Bill Bradley tinkered with a position that has  
kept him at odds with the teachers' unions. Vice President Al Gore, 
having already tried to smooth things with steelworkers, honed an 
attack on Republicans -- his sharpest yet, aides promised -- in 
defense of unions. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democrats' political duel for organized labor, a balancing  
act for both candidates and a tighter-than-anticipated battle for 
Gore, heads into a crucial round this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	As a Labor Day kickoff, the two presidential rivals will stump  
Monday's parade routes, Bradley in homestate New Jersey and Gore in 
Iowa, home of the first nominating contest of next season. The vice 
president, stopping first in Michigan with AFL-CIO president John 
Sweeney, also planned a frenetic round of labor picnics and 
rallies. 
</P>
<P>
	Aides promised Gore, who has yet to attack GOP presidential  
front-runner George W. Bush by name, would lob his most direct hit 
to date on the Texas governor for supporting measures that would 
force unions to get approval from all members before spending their 
dues on politics. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're making labor's No. 1 issue our No. 1 issue this  
weekend,'' enthused Gore spokesman Chris Lehane. 
</P>
<P>
	At stake in the courtship of unions are the phone banks,  
door-knocking sweeps and car pools vital to winning early contests 
in Iowa and New Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
	The AFL-CIO is expected at its October meeting finally to throw  
the weight of its 13 million members behind the vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley had encouraged the federation, which first addressed a  
possible endorsement in February, to wait. That forced Gore to 
spend more time than he'd expected competing for the AFL-CIO 
imprimatur. 
</P>
<P>
	``The odds-on favorite right now would be Gore,'' said  
federation Secretary-Treasurer Richard Trumka. ``People have dealt 
with him for a while and they feel comfortable with him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Comfortable, but not ecstatic.  
</P>
<P>
	Neither Gore nor Bradley has a perfect record on issues dear to  
union members. Both supported NAFTA and the General Agreement on 
Trade and Tariffs, which unions bitterly fault for protecting an 
artist's intellectual property rights but not an American worker's 
right to keep his job from moving overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	AFL-CIO voting score cards from the years 1985 to 1992, when  
Bradley and Gore were in the Senate together, show nearly identical 
good ratings. Both support increasing the minimum wage. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley recently endorsed loosening picket rules, withholding  
government contracts from companies that violate labor laws and 
increasing damages against companies that fire employees for 
organizing unions. On Friday, Gore drew cheers from union women in 
Chicago when he pledged a war against ``union busting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think there's any substantive differences'' between  
the two, said Mark Smith, president of the Iowa Federation of 
Labor. 
</P>
<P>
	``They tend both to be supportive of the labor union, worker  
rights, organizing, the right of unions to exist,'' said Smith. 
``Both of them are screwed up on job security and trade.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both have labored of late to paste over the blemishes.  
</P>
<P>
	Last month, the Clinton-Gore administration unveiled a plan to  
bolster the troubled steel industry. The measure was valentine to 
steelworkers who blamed the White House for surging steel imports. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a first step, but we're obviously committed to doing  
as much as possible. Having a strong steel industry and strong 
steelworkers is good for America,'' Lehane said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Bradley backed off his voting record in favor of  
school voucher experiments, saying he does not now believe that 
giving parents public funds for private-school tuition is ``the 
answer to the problems of public education.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spokeswoman Anita Dunn said Bradley's votes for vouchers  
signified only that ``you cannot just outright eliminate any 
possibility'' for helping children trapped in bad schools. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue is a hot one for the 950,000 teachers in the American  
Federation of Teachers, which is likely to decide its endorsement 
in October. AFT president Sandra Feldman gave the advantage to 
Gore, saying, ``He is clear on his support for public education.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two candidates are playing tit for tat.  
</P>
<P>
	Bradley boasts that he is this season's only presidential  
candidate with a union pension. His allies point out that Gore, 
during his 1988 presidential campaign, supported the rights of 
states to pass ``right-to-work'' laws banning compulsory union 
membership. In the Senate, Bradley cast a pro-labor vote against 
such measures. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore has since changed his mind, aides said.  
</P>
<P>
	In turn, Gore allies noted that the same year of Gore's offense,  
Bradley committed his own with anti-labor votes on textile import 
limits and ``Buy American'' provisions. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore, who has courted Sweeney and other union bigwigs with  
access to the most intimate White House strategy sessions and 
social gatherings, has already bagged 16 union endorsements. He 
expects to collect more on this weekend's sweep through Michigan 
and Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	On Bradley's side, Dunn all but conceded the endorsement game,  
saying Bradley will continue to care about rank-and-file union 
members ``with or without endorsements.''

<HEADLINE>  Security Deployed for India Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- With one million police and soldiers  
providing security, Indians began voting Sunday in the world's 
largest general election -- a contest pitting the heavily favored 
ruling coalition against Italian-born opposition leader Sonia 
Gandhi. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's voting by millions of Indians capped a campaign marred  
by militant threats and personal attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	By the time the five-phase, staggered voting ends Oct. 3, some  
600 million people will have been able to cast ballots for the 
federal legislature, which must convene by Oct. 21. Voting is 
staggered to help maintain security. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 160 million voters are eligible to elect 145  
legislators, more than a quarter of India's lower house of 
Parliament, or Lok Sabha. Of the 1,068 candidates in Sunday's race, 
only 69 are women. 
</P>
<P>
	Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, riding a wave of personal  
popularity, is expected to lead his jigsaw coalition of nearly two 
dozen parties back to power. The election was called after 
Vajpayee's government lost a parliamentary vote of confidence by a 
single vote in April. 
</P>
<P>
	Polls show Vajpayee running well ahead of Mrs. Gandhi, leader of  
the opposition Congress party, whose Italian birth has been a key 
issue in the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Gandhi is contesting one seat in Sunday's vote in Bellary  
in southern India. She also is running in another constituency in 
northern Uttar Pradesh state, where voting is scheduled Oct. 3. In 
India, candidates are allowed to contest up to 10 seats. If she 
wins more than one, she keeps the seat of her choice and must 
relinquish the others, where fresh elections must be held. 
</P>
<P>
	About 4.5 million civil servants will supervise 800,000 polling  
stations. Even schoolchildren -- 1.1 million of them -- have been 
asked to help. 
</P>
<P>
	Extra troops were sent to insurrection-plagued areas to prevent  
violence, either by political opponents or anti-Indian guerrilla 
forces. Liquor stores were ordered closed on Sunday. The voting 
began at 7 a.m. (9:30 p.m. EDT Saturday.) 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, a senior police officer and two other policemen  
were shot at close range and killed in the southern state of Andhra 
Pradesh. Police blamed the outlawed People's War Group, which 
advocates social revolution and has threatened to disrupt the 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
	In the northern state of Jammu-Kashmir, three Islamic guerrillas  
stormed into a building where six paramilitary and intelligence 
officers were stationed to supervise security arrangements for the 
election. The officers locked themselves up inside a room while the 
military tried to force out the militants holed up in the same 
building, said E. Rammohan, who heads the paramilitary Border 
Security Force. 
</P>
<P>
	After 16 hours, Indian commandos rescued all but one of the  
officers and killed the three guerrillas, police said. One of the 
captured soldiers was killed by a grenade lobbed by the militants 
before they stormed the building, Rammohan said. 
</P>
<P>
	The campaign has been marred by bitter personal attacks,  
especially against Mrs. Gandhi, the 52-year-old widow of Rajiv 
Gandhi and daughter-in-law of Indira Gandhi, both former prime 
ministers who were assassinated. 
</P>
<P>
	Vajpayee's campaigners have said the election of a foreign-born  
prime minister would be an ``insult to the 1 billion Indians'' -- 
and even a security threat. 
</P>
<P>
	India claimed archrival Pakistan was linked to efforts to  
disrupt the voting. Police in New Delhi recently displayed 130 
pounds of plastic explosives, which allegedly came from Pakistan's 
Inter Services Intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
	Pakistan routinely denies Indian accusations that it supports  
militants in India.

<HEADLINE> It's a Whole New Ballgame in NFL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	John Elway, Reggie White and Barry Sanders are gone. The  
Cleveland Browns and instant replay are back. And the Denver 
Broncos are trying to become the first team to win three straight 
Super Bowls with a quarterback whose father failed to accomplish 
that feat a quarter-century ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Welcome to NFL '99, where the commissioner remains upbeat.  
</P>
<P>
	``It seems that every time you lose a great player there are two  
great players to replace him,'' Paul Tagliabue said. 
</P>
<P>
	He can point to a lot of candidates, led by wide receiver Randy  
Moss of Minnesota, quarterback Peyton Manning of Indianapolis and 
running back Fred Taylor of Jacksonville. Their rookie seasons last 
year put them all on the brink of stardom. 
</P>
<P>
	Then there are rookie running backs Edgerrin James of the Colts  
and Ricky Williams of the Saints, and five quarterbacks taken in 
the first round of the draft. Subtract the cantankerous, 
disappointing and now injured second-year quarterback Ryan Leaf and 
Tagliabue might have his new stars to replace the departing ones. 
</P>
<P>
	But Denver is thinking most about another second-year  
quarterback, Brian Griese, who will replace Elway after throwing 
only three passes in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Griese's father, Bob, quarterbacked the Miami Dolphins to Super  
Bowl victories in 1973 and '74 but couldn't repeat the third year. 
</P>
<P>
	Elway's job was supposed to go to Bubby Brister, a 37-year-old  
journeyman who was 4-0 as a starter for the Broncos last season. 
But Brister struggled in four exhibitions, Griese starred against 
second- and third-stringers, and coach Mike Shanahan awarded him 
the job. 
</P>
<P>
	Elway's retirement after 16 seasons was no surprise -- he almost  
left after winning his first Super Bowl in 1998 following three 
losses a decade ago. Before last January's victory over Atlanta, he 
said he was 99 percent sure he would leave and added the additional 
1 percent in April, when he announced his retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	As for White, he left even though his final year with the  
Packers was good enough to earn him Defensive Player of the Year 
honors. At 36, the NFL's career sack leader had recurring back 
problems as well as his elusive Super Bowl ring. He earned it when 
Green Bay beat New England in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sanders was a shock, particularly since he departed needing  
only 1,458 yards to break Walter Payton's career rushing record. He 
had little to say, although his family, friends and teammates 
indicated he was tired of playing on a team, the Detroit Lions, 
that seemed to be going nowhere. 
</P>
<P>
	He said nothing to anyone, ignoring nearly a dozen attempts by  
Lions coach Bobby Ross to reach him, then announced his departure 
in a faxed statement just as training camp opened. 
</P>
<P>
	Then there are the Browns, whose return this year was mandated  
when Art Modell took the old Browns from Cleveland after the 1995 
season and turned them into the Baltimore Ravens. They had to leave 
their history, colors and name behind for the new team and build a 
``Dawg Pound'' for their most ardent fans in the new stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	But the new Browns have a San Francisco flavor.  
</P>
<P>
	They're owned by Al Lerner, Modell's former partner in  
Cleveland. They're run, however, by Carmen Policy, the 49ers' 
president during their glory years, and Dwight Clark, the Niners' 
former GM who made ``The Catch'' from Joe Montana that sent them to 
the first of the five Super Bowls they won during the '80s and 
'90s. 
</P>
<P>
	They also went to camp with 12 former 49ers on their roster,  
including Ty Detmer, who will start the season at quarterback ahead 
of Tim Couch, the No. 1 overall pick in the draft and the first of 
those five QBs chosen. 
</P>
<P>
	With the help of some good free agents, they hope to approach  
the success of the '95 expansion teams, Jacksonville and Carolina, 
who went to conference championship games in their second seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``I see signs, just not enough signs,'' coach Chris Palmer said  
as the Browns struggled through the exhibition season. 
</P>
<P>
	Instant replay, last used in 1991, was brought back after  
several controversial calls in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike the old system, which allowed a replay official to stop  
the game whenever he saw something questionable, it gives coaches 
two challenges per game (using a buzzer to the officials). Teams 
that lose the challenge also lose a time out. 
</P>
<P>
	In the last two minutes of every half, a replay official can  
stop the game to review a questionable call. The review is supposed 
to last no more than 90 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	But results in preseason have been spotty.  
</P>
<P>
	An exhibition game between Jacksonville and the New York Giants  
was delayed 10 minutes by a replay official in the final two 
minutes and the final call appeared to be wrong. There have been 
other long delays and missed replay calls, something the league 
attributes to ``working out the bugs in preseason.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not going to be perfect,'' said Mike Holmgren,  
co-chairman of the league's competition committee who worked hard 
for several years to bring back replay. ``We tried to put in the 
best system that could get the necessary votes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holmgren, who went from Green Bay to become coach and general  
manager in Seattle, is one of nine new coaches, including Palmer in 
Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	The others are Brian Billick in Baltimore, Gunther Cunningham in  
Kansas City, Mike Riley in San Diego, Andy Reid in Philadelphia, 
Dick Jauron in Chicago, Ray Rhodes in Green Bay and George Seifert 
in Carolina. Like Holmgren, Rhodes and Seifert are on their second 
jobs: Rhodes was fired after last season by the Eagles and Seifert 
coached the 49ers to Super Bowls in 1990 and 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite Elway's retirement, Denver could make it three Super  
Bowls in a row, but only if Griese and Brister play well. Everyone 
else is back, led by Terrell Davis, who was MVP last year after 
becoming only the fourth player to run for 2,000 yards. Free agent 
cornerback Dale Carter and rookie linebacker Al Wilson improve the 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
	But to get to the Super Bowl, the Broncos will have to get by  
Jacksonville and the New York Jets, whom they beat in the AFC title 
game last season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jaguars, who have made the playoffs in three of their four  
NFL seasons, have reinforced an oft-injured and shaky defense with 
free-agent safety Carnell Lake and new coordinator Dom Capers, the 
former Carolina coach. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jets are counting on a second straight career year from  
quarterback Vinny Testaverde, the league's best linebacking corps 
and the ability of coach Bill Parcells to squeeze the last ounce of 
effort from his players. 
</P>
<P>
	In the NFC, Minnesota, led by Moss and Randall Cunningham, is  
the favorite by default after a 15-1 season that ended in a 
disappointing loss to Atlanta in the conference title game. The 
Falcons, who finished 14-2 last season, will contend with San 
Francisco in the West, and Dallas and the Giants are the best of a 
mediocre East.

<HEADLINE> Eagles Cut Eight Players </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Two weeks ago, guard George Hegamin was  
demoted from his starting job and stormed out of the Philadelphia 
Eagles locker room before returning to practice the next day. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, Hegamin was given a one-way ticket off the team.  
</P>
<P>
	The offensive lineman was the most notable of the eight players  
the team released as it pared the roster to 61 players. The Eagles 
must get down to the NFL roster limit of 53 active players by 4 
p.m. Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had not been playing as well as I figured,'' coach Andy  
Reid said. ``He appeared to give every bit of an effort to be here. 
George gave a maximum effort to be the best he could be. But he 
became expendable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Hegamin, the Eagles released offensive lineman  
Robert Barr, linebackers Dana Howard and Antonio London, wide 
receiver Donald Sellers, defensive linemen Henry Slay and Tyrone 
Williams and safety Sean Woodson. 
</P>
<P>
	The Eagles signed Hegamin as an unrestricted free agent prior to  
the 1998 season. He played as a backup for much of the season 
before breaking into the starting lineup at left guard late in the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	As the Eagles entered this year's training camp, Hegamin figured  
on being a starter at left guard. But after the team's second 
exhibition game, against the New York Jets, Reid replaced Hegamin 
with rookie Doug Brzezinski. Hegamin was so upset that he left the 
team for a day. 
</P>
<P>
	When he returned the next day, Hegamin was fined by Reid and  
forced to push a blocking sled 100 yards in front of onlooking 
reporters as punishment. Hegamin then apologized to his coaches and 
teammates, and vowed to stick with Reid ``until the end.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The end came Saturday.  
</P>
<P>
	``That incident had nothing to do with this,'' Reid said. ``Once  
it was over, it was over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	London was only other player from the group released Saturday  
who figured to make a serious roster run when he was signed. But he 
made little impact in the preseason after missing virtually all of 
last season with a knee injury while playing for the Green Bay 
Packers. 
</P>
<P>
	As it stood Saturday, the Eagles were heavy at defensive back  
with 10 players, at running back with seven players, at tight end 
with four, and at wide receiver with seven. They are also expected 
to be extremely active claiming players off the waiver wire and 
looking at potential trades in the next couple of days. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're doing everything possible to upgrade this team,'' Reid  
said. ``We are not going to sit still.''

</P>
<P>
	NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) -- Lionel S. Jackson Sr., former publisher  
of the New Haven Register and Journal-Courier newspapers, died 
Wednesday at his home in Montecito, Calif., after a long illness. 
He was 84. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson was publisher of Jackson Newspapers from 1973 to 1982.  
His father, John Day Jackson, purchased the Register in 1895 and 
the Morning Journal-Courier in 1925. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1986, the John Day Jackson Trust sold the newspapers for an  
estimated $185 million. The paper was later sold to the current 
owners, Journal Register Company. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson began his career at the Register in 1936, working at  
various capacities before rising to national advertising manager in 
the 1940s. He took over as sole publisher for both papers in 1973. 
After his son assumed the post in 1982, he retained the titles of 
chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer 
until the sale of the newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
	He is survived by his wife, Patricia Hope Johnstone Jackson; two  
daughters, a son and five grandchildren.

<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Charles Lowe, who guided the career of  
actress Carol Channing during their four-decade marriage, died 
Thursday. He was 87. 
</P>
<P>
	Lowe and Miss Channing, 78, separated last year after she  
accused him of mismanagement. The two were estranged at the time of 
Lowe's death, publicist Alan Eichler said. 
</P>
<P>
	A native of Steel City, Neb., Lowe served in the Army during  
World War II. After the war, he went from advertising executive to 
producer of the 1950-58 ``The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show'' 
on CBS. 
</P>
<P>
	He and Miss Channing married in 1956 and Lowe focused his  
attention on her stage career. He also produced five network TV 
specials with his wife, including ``An Evening with Carol 
Channing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In May 1998, Ms. Channing filed for divorce.  

</P>
<P>
                           *Jeanne Miles    	
</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- American painter Jeanne Miles, an abstract  
artist whose geometric creations were inspired by Asian art and 
ideas, died Aug. 27 at age 90. 
</P>
<P>
	Her half-century career produced a series of one-woman shows at  
New York galleries as well as paintings for the permanent 
collections of such museums as the Los Angeles County Museum of Art 
and the Guggenheim Museum. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Miles' paintings earned the 1968 American Institute of Arts  
and Letters Award, the 1970 and 1973 Mark Rothko Awards and the 
1974 Pelham von Stdeffler Art Fund Grant. 
</P>
<P>
	She taught at Oberlin College in Ohio, Moravian College in  
Pennsylvania and Yale. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of her work was based on geometric abstractions of  
mandalas. A mandala, which is Sanskrit for circle, is often used to 
symbolize the universe or totality in Hinduism and Buddhism.

 *Charles Perry    	
</P>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Charles ``Chuck'' Perry, founding president of  
Florida International University, died at his home in Rockwall, 
Texas on Monday. He was 62. 
</P>
<P>
	Perry was just 31 when the Florida Board of Regents hired him in  
1969 to turn an abandoned airfield into a public university. 
</P>
<P>
	FIU started classes in September 1972 with a founding student  
body of 5,600. Before then, the Miami area was among the largest in 
the country without a public university. 
</P>
<P>
	Perry's colleagues and successors credit him with guiding the  
fledgling university through hostile politics and allowing it to 
break out of that state-imposed box when its political base was 
strong enough. 
</P>
<P>
	Perry stepped down from the presidency in 1975, after telling  
reporters he was having trouble making the transition from the 
excitement of building FIU to the routine of administering it. 
After 2 1/2 years heading corporations, including Golden Bear 
International and Family Weekly magazine, he became dean of the 
Graduate School of Management at the University of Dallas in 1993.

and co-founder of Teledyne Inc. who designed an aircraft guidance 
system used worldwide, died Tuesday of brain cancer. He was 82. 
</P>
<P>
	Singleton led one of the nation's largest conglomerates for  
three decades. He was known for his prowess on Wall Street and was 
a merger guru from the 1960s to the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	He launched Teledyne in 1960 as a semiconductor maker with his  
partner George Kozmetsky. Their first venture was building digital 
computers for aircraft and space exploration projects. Singleton 
developed the inertial guidance system now used in commercial and 
military aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
	By the mid-1980s, conglomerates were not in favor with Wall  
Street and Teledyne began divesting itself. It also became involved 
in military procurement scandals and paid more than $100 million in 
fines to settle claims that it inflated bills to the Pentagon and 
falsified tests on electronic components. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes magazine listed Singleton as one of the nation's 400  
richest people last year with an estimated fortune of $750 million. 
Singleton retired as Teledyne's chief executive officer in 1986, 
but remained as chairman until 1991.

	ELKHART, Ind. (AP) -- Walter O. Wells, one of the founders of  
Schult Homes Corp. and one of the patriarchs of the manufactured 
housing industry, has died. He was 87. 
</P>
<P>
	He had been chairman emeritus of Schult until 1997, a year  
before the Middlebury-based maker of mobile and modular homes 
merged with Oakwood Homes Corp. of Greensboro, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Wells went to work at the Wilbur J. Schult Trailer Market in  
1934, managing the startup of Schult's manufacturing. 
</P>
<P>
	Wells was president of the Mobile Home Manufacturers Association  
in 1952 and 1953.

	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Jerry Wynn, a former public relations  
director for the New Orleans Saints and the San Diego Chargers, 
died Wednesday of complications following cancer surgery. He was 
69. 
</P>
<P>
	After 12 years as public relations director for the Chargers, he  
moved to New Orleans in 1977 and took the same job with the Saints. 
</P>
<P>
	Wynn also was sports manager for the 1984 world's fair in New  
Orleans, a public relations consultant for the city of New Orleans, 
and a coordinator of media transportation for Pope John Paul II's 
visit to New Orleans in 1987.

</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Art historian Mark Zebrowski, a leading expert on  
the Islamic art of India, died Aug. 22 of cancer at age 54. 
</P>
<P>
	Zebrowski was born and educated in the United States. He lived  
many years in Britain, and went to India when he joined the Peace 
Corps in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
	While teaching English at a school in Karimnagar in  
south-central India, he became interested in the intricate 
silverwork of the area and the artwork of the Deccani sultanate. 
</P>
<P>
	Zebrowski later studied in Paris and at Harvard University. His  
1983 thesis, ``Deccani Painting,'' became the standard work on the 
subject. Another book was published in 1997, and he completed work 
on another this year while gravely ill.

<TEXT>
<P>
	FOXBORO, Mass. (AP) -- Manuel Lagos scored the first two goals of  
his career and set up two more as the Tampa Bay Mutiny beat the New 
England Revolution 5-1 Saturday in Major League Soccer. 
</P>
<P>
	Tampa (13-14) extended its winning streak to four games.  
</P>
<P>
	Lagos' six points equaled a Mutiny single-game scoring high.  
</P>
<P>
	Raul Diaz Arce, Carlos Valderrama and Mauricio Ramos also scored  
for the Mutiny, who set a single-game mark for most goals. 
</P>
<P>
	Tampa Bay opened the scoring in the 15th minute when Lagos got  
past a sluggish Revolution defense before ripping a shot past New 
England goalkeeper Walter Zenga from eight yards. 
</P>
<P>
	The lone bright spot of the evening for the Revolution (9-17)  
came in the 17th minute, when Giovanni Savarese headed in an 
equalizer from six yards out. New England has won just once in its 
last 10. 
</P>
<P>
	Lagos got his second goal of the game at the 20-minute mark.  
Diaz Arce gave the Mutiny a 3-1 cushion with a goal in the 38th 
minute. 
</P>
<P>
	Valderrama scored his third goal of the season three minutes  
into the second half. Ramos rounded out the scoring as he scored 
off a pass from Lagos at 67 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	New England has won only one game since the All-Star break and  
is in the midst of a 1-8 slump. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday's game was the second half of a doubleheader that  
started with the U.S. women's soccer team beating Ireland 5-0. It 
was the first time the U.S. players competed together since their 
World Cup victory.

<HEADLINE>  Romanowski Issues Apology on Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Denver Broncos linebacker Bill Romanowski, under  
investigation for obtaining a prescription drug through fraud, 
issued an apology after Friday night's exhibition game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't talk about any of that right now,'' Romanowski said,  
``but I apologize to my teammates, the organization and all the 
fans that support me. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully, this won't affect me. Hopefully, somehow and some  
way I can get through this, that I can be ready to play next 
week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He called the Broncos' 34-3 victory over San Francisco ``very  
much of a good break. Whenever I can go out on the field and do 
what I love to do, I have the passion for the game. It was nice. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wasn't distracted. Once I took the field I was ready to  
play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Romanowski's coach, Mike Shanahan, said he has known about the  
potential legal problems for several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just disappointed it all came out without going to the  
D.A. first,'' Shanahan said. ``People will eventually see that this 
is not a serious deal. I'll be surprised if there ever is a charge. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew about it around three weeks ago, maybe a month ago.  
We'll just have to let the courts do their job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Romanowski could be charged with felony counts of fraud and  
deceit and conspiracy, and a misdemeanor charge of unlawful use of 
a controlled substance. 
</P>
<P>
	Douglas County sheriff's officials said Romanowski's wife,  
Julie, and another woman allegedly obtained bogus prescriptions 
from a doctor for the drug Phentermine and gave it to Romanowski 
for his personal use.

<HEADLINE> Woof! Woof! The Browns Are Back </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Three long years, 21 if you're counting in Dawg  
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Life without the NFL was tough on Cleveland. Sundays weren't the  
same here. Neither were Mondays, Tuesdays or Wednesdays. 
</P>
<P>
	Heck, even hating the Pittsburgh Steelers wasn't the same. The  
Baltimore Ravens became the new enemy. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was as if you'd lost your best friend,'' said John  
Thompson, a k a Big Dawg, the leader of a 10,000-member pack of 
rabid fans known as the Dawg Pound. 
</P>
<P>
	``But now he's coming home.''  
</P>
<P>
	In the Year of the Retirement, finally a stirring comeback. One  
of the most storied names in American sports, the Cleveland Browns, 
are returning after being forced into retirement when former owner 
Art Modell took his team to Baltimore in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	You remember the Browns. Orange helmets with white stripes and  
no logos. White home jerseys. Paul Brown. Otto Graham. Jim Brown. 
Bernie Kosar. Dreary old Cleveland Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Well, the Browns are back as an expansion team in 1999. They'll  
look pretty much the same as they always did, but these aren't your 
dad's Browns. 
</P>
<P>
	They've got a new owner, a sparkling new $283 million stadium --  
built on the same spot as the old place -- a front office with a 
Super Bowl blueprint, rookie quarterback Tim Couch and a proud city 
so pumped to have football back that 30,000 fans showed up for the 
new Browns first practice in their new home. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're back,'' Big Dawg said. ``It's exciting. It's almost like  
the resurrection. It's not like an expansion team. It's like the 
same team is coming back with new life. And look at Cleveland, 
we're not the Mistake on the Lake anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland has changed dramatically. One of the country's great  
industrial cities, it became a national joke during the 1970s when 
the polluted Cuyahoga River caught fire and the Indians averaged 
100 losses a year. 
</P>
<P>
	But the city has undergone a remarkable renaissance. The Rock  
and Roll Hall of Fame has brought in tourists, who dine in the 
renovated Warehouse District, and if they can get a ticket, catch 
the Indians in sold out Jacobs Field. 
</P>
<P>
	All that had been missing were the Browns, who for years were  
the best thing about the town. Cleveland was always Browns Town, 
the unofficial capital of football-crazy Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's in our blood,'' said linebacker Chris Spielman, an Ohio  
native forced to retire two weeks before the Browns opener because 
of a neck injury. ``Like Louisiana has gumbo, we have football.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That changed on Nov. 6, 1995, when Modell, upset with city  
officials' refusal to build him a stadium as they had for the 
Indians and Cavaliers and unwilling to sell his team, announced 
from Baltimore he was moving the team there. 
</P>
<P>
	Back in Ohio, grown men raised on Browns football, wept openly.  
</P>
<P>
	``I can't tell you how much that hurt,'' bricklayer Richard  
Holloway said during the summer after putting in a tough day 
helping build the Cleveland Browns Stadium. ``Talk about shock.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shock and pain. A deep, deep pain. And a feeling of betrayal.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was as though they'd been cheated,'' said Browns president  
Carmen Policy, who got five Super Bowl rings working for the San 
Francisco 49ers. ``People refer to it like a death in the family. 
But it wasn't just a death in the family. It was like a family 
member had been murdered. It wasn't just a loss, it was a cruel and 
unfair loss.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland, though, wasn't about to let its heart get ripped out  
without a fight. And with Mayor Michael White leading the effort, 
Browns fans bombarded the NFL with faxes and marched on owners 
meetings trying to persuade the league to restore, not replace, 
their beloved team. 
</P>
<P>
	Big Dawg went to Washington, and broke down crying in front of a  
congressional committee as he tried to explain the injustice of it 
all. 
</P>
<P>
	Save Our Browns became Cleveland's campaign and war cry.  
</P>
<P>
	The sense of loss hit home with NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue,  
who remembered the heartbreak he felt when his Dodgers moved from 
Brooklyn. 
</P>
<P>
	Tagliabue wanted to put football back in one of the league's  
signature cities quickly, and less than two months after the Browns 
played their final game in Cleveland Stadium, NFL owners approved a 
deal that allowed Modell to leave. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland, in turn, got to keep its nickname, colors and  
history. 
</P>
<P>
	``It couldn't be any other way,'' said billionaire banker Al  
Lerner, who bought the team for $530 million last September. ``This 
town wouldn't stand for anything else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL has been trumpeting the Browns' return and scheduled  
their home opener for Sunday night of opening weekend on national 
TV against the Steelers. 
</P>
<P>
	From the time the league awarded Lerner ownership, the Browns  
had only 11 months to put the team in place before their first 
exhibition game. 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast, Carolina and Jacksonville had two years to get  
ready. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I took the job in January,'' Browns coach Chris Palmer  
said, ``I walked into my office and I didn't have a secretary, 
there were boxes all over the place. I thought, `Hey, what did I 
get myself into?' '' 
</P>
<P>
	Lerner put the team's future in the hands of Policy, who in turn  
put the Browns' football operations in the hands of Dwight Clark, 
famous for making ``The Catch'' in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	In January, the Browns' coaching search seemed to be going  
nowhere when Mike Holmgren, then Steve Mariucci and finally Brian 
Billick all slipped away. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Browns found their man in Palmer, Jacksonville's  
offensive coordinator who now seems as if he were destined to lead 
the Browns into a new football era. 
</P>
<P>
	Friendly with boundless energy, Palmer comes across as an  
English teacher in looks and daily preparation. Everything the 
Browns have done during the preseason has been planned out to the 
second by Palmer, much the way Cleveland coach Paul Brown worked 
during his days as an NFL coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer spent any free time this summer -- there wasn't much --  
rereading Brown's biography. 
</P>
<P>
	And before they took the field on the first day of training  
camp, the new Browns got a history lesson as Palmer showed them a 
highlight film on the old Browns. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted them to understand what it means to put that helmet  
on every day,'' Palmer said. ``To know what it means to play for 
the Cleveland Browns.''

<HEADLINE> Runners Work for $1M Jackpot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP)-- One more win means at least $500,000.  
</P>
<P>
	If Gabriela Szabo wins her 3,000-meter race and Wilson Kipketer  
his 800 at Tuesday's ISTAF meet in Berlin the two World Champions 
can share the Golden League jackpot of $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	They set themselves up for that scenario after winning their  
events at the Van Damme Memorial meet late Friday, the penultimate 
of the seven Golden League events. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Szabo's and Kipketer's first races since winning gold  
medals at the World Championships in Seville, Spain. 
</P>
<P>
	Denmark's Kipketer ran the season's best time in the 800,  
finishing in 1 minute, 42.27 seconds, ahead of South Africa's 
Hezekiel Sepeng. 
</P>
<P>
	Kipketer was within a world-record pace at the halfway mark, but  
finished 1.16 seconds back. Sepeng beat the South African record 
with 1:42.69. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dane seemed lackadaisical about the prospect of a $500,000  
payday in Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody is working to get a salary,'' Kipketer said. ``I  
have to run to get my salary. I have to run fast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Szabo had to battle Morocco's Zahra Ouaziz to get in position  
for the million-dollar race. 
</P>
<P>
	On the home straight, Szabo managed to move out in front. Szabo  
knew she would face a tough fight to secure the big money. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know what will happen, maybe I won't feel well in  
Berlin. I'm not a machine, not a robot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barmasai had another point to prove.  
</P>
<P>
	Steeplechase world record-holder Bernard Barmasai also won his  
sixth race out of six Friday, but the IAAF has eliminated him from 
the jackpot competition. If he wins the last of the seven races (in 
Berlin) and is denied the Golden League purse, he said he might sue 
the IAAF. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to run good in Berlin, then after to do something,''  
Barmasai told reporters after the race. ``You cannot be employed 
somewhere, then get no salary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a great performance which had no impact on the Golden League,  
Morocco's Hicham El Guerrouj ran the second-fastest men's 3,000 in 
history, 7:23.09, only 2.42 seconds off Kenyan Daniel Komen's 
record.

<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Robert Warzycha scored off a rebound of  
his own missed shot Saturday night to give the Columbus Crew a 2-1 
victory over the Colorado Rapids in the MLS. 
</P>
<P>
	The Crew's win, combined with losses by New England and Miami,  
put them in the playoffs for the fourth time in the league's 
four-year history. Columbus (16-10) also set a franchise record for 
victories. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbus swept the season series with Colorado 2-0 after  
defeating the Rapids once in the three previous seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Stern John opened the scoring for the Crew in the 13th minute on  
a header, with assists by Rob Smith and Mike Lapper. Marcelo Balboa 
tied the score in the 35th minute on a 30-yard free kick. 
</P>
<P>
	The Crew led 17-14 in total shots and 8-5 in shots on goal.  
Goalkeeper Ian Feuer had six saves for Colorado (16-9), while Mark 
Dougherty made three saves for the Crew.

<HEADLINE> New York Braces for Youth March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- As organizers of the Million Youth March  
prepared to bring the event to Harlem for a second year, they 
promised a peaceful rally that would offer words of encouragement 
to black and Hispanic youth. 
</P>
<P>
	But many neighborhood residents and politicians looked upon  
today's event with a mixture of dread and fear -- dread that some 
speakers would once again deliver hate-filled speeches, and fear 
that clashes with police would result in the same violence that 
occurred in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want the police coming in with riot gear and  
helicopters like last year,'' said Saundra Woodbine, whose bedroom 
window looks on the stage. ``That was a mess. But the way things 
have gone so far, a lot of us fear a repeat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, after several speakers lashed out at Jews, whites,  
black elected officials and others, police approached the stage as 
the event was scheduled to end. As officers came near, organizer 
Khallid Abdul Muhammad called on participants to beat the officers 
with their own nightsticks or to shoot them with their own guns if 
provoked. 
</P>
<P>
	Some marchers threw bottles and chairs as a police helicopter  
swooped above. Twenty-eight people were injured. 
</P>
<P>
	The buildup to today's march, scheduled for this afternoon, has  
been similar to last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Again, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Muhammad have traded words.  
This year and last, the mayor has called the rally a ``hate 
march.'' And Muhammad -- a former Nation of Islam spokesman fired 
for his anti-Semitic comments -- has once more called Giuliani a 
``cracker.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also once again, a federal judge sided with organizers, allowing  
them to march after the city denied a permit. 
</P>
<P>
	In his ruling allowing today's event, U.S. District Judge Denny  
Chin held the city partially responsible for creating last year's 
fracas. 
</P>
<P>
	``Excessive numbers of police officers in riot gear, rigid  
enforcement of deadlines and helicopters swooping over the crowd 
can only increase, rather than lessen, tensions,'' Chin said. 
</P>
<P>
	To avoid clashes, police have decided to use fewer officers at  
today's march. Police also plan to keep subway stations in the area 
open and to not use the metal barricades that last year kept 
marchers penned in. Helicopters and riot gear are not expected to 
be used. 
</P>
<P>
	``We intend to act reasonably, and we intend to have adequate  
police presence up there to make sure this is a safe event,'' 
Police Commissioner Howard Safir said. ``We would ask that Khallid 
Muhammad and his people do the same.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers say their aim is to avoid violence.  
</P>
<P>
	``We are coming in peace, and safety, and security,'' rally  
organizer Malik Zulu Shabazz said Friday. ``We will start on time, 
and we will end on time. It will be peaceful as well as powerful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those assurances have not convinced Harlem's politicians, who  
have called for a boycott. 
</P>
<P>
	``There can be no value to this community, to any individual in  
this community, to attend this event,'' said City Council member 
Bill Perkins.

<HEADLINE> Baptists to Members: Pray for Jews </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT WORTH (AP) -- Southern Baptists are asking members to pray  
that Jews will convert to Christianity this month during Rosh 
Hashanah, the Jewish new year, and Yom Kippur, the Jewish Day of 
Atonement. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosh Hashanah is next Saturday and Yom Kippur on Sept. 20, with  
both celebrations beginning at sundown the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	A ``prayer guide'' published and distributed by the Southern  
Baptist International Mission Board in Richmond, Va., explains the 
Jewish high holy days, gives sketches of Jewish people in different 
parts of the world and offers suggestions on how to pray for Jewish 
people. 
</P>
<P>
	The guide urges Baptists to ``to pray for Jewish individuals you  
know by name.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some Jewish leaders described the action as arrogant and  
offensive. 
</P>
<P>
	``Baptists have a right to believe what they believe,'' said  
Mark Briskman, Southwest regional director for the Anti-Defamation 
League of B'nai B'rith. ``But we find this offensive. It shows an 
element of arrogance because they are specifically targeting Jews 
during this holy season.''

<HEADLINE> Holtz Returns to the Sidelines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- The last time Lou Holtz coached a game at  
Carter-Finley Stadium, he was on the other side of the field, 
taking on a team wearing a deeper shade of red than the Wolfpack. 
</P>
<P>
	A Holtz-led North Carolina State team beat South Carolina 28-21  
in his final home game as coach in November 1975 before a one-year 
stint in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	Four teams, 24 years, one national championship, 170 college  
wins and a two-year commentating career later, Holtz returned 
Saturday as the Gamecocks' coach, opening the season at N.C. State 
with a 10-0 loss. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's disappointing, but it's a start,'' Holtz said, dodging  
most questions about his return to coaching. ``Right up until the 
last seconds, we thought we had a chance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the return was ``not nostalgic,'' perhaps because his  
Gamecocks less than impressive than the teams he's known for 
coaching. South Carolina fumbled the ball eight times and converted 
only eight of 18 third downs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are really not a team that moves the ball as well as I'd  
like,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	South Carolina had some chances to score, but it was the defense  
that showed the most promise as it held N.C. State to just 126 
rushing yards. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our defense played magnificently,'' Holtz said.  
</P>
<P>
	Despite the loss and heavy rains and wind that swept the field  
through the entire game from Tropical Storm Dennis, South Carolina 
fans were patient and willing to wait for success. 
</P>
<P>
	``We love him. We're glad he's here,'' said Gamecock fan Dick  
Childress of Columbia, S.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Childress and other fans, many wearing the garnet and black of  
USC, huddled under cover near the concession stands during halftime 
to keep dry. 
</P>
<P>
	``We might not win a lot of games this year,'' Childress said.  
``He can bring more character and class and give us a good 
reputation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holtz unexpectedly left Notre Dame in 1996 after 11 years in  
which he led the Irish to the 1988 national championship and a 
100-30-1 record. After leaving Notre Dame, he was a college 
football commentator on CBS, but the desire to coach never went 
away. 
</P>
<P>
	In December, South Carolina named Holtz its new coach after  
firing Brad Scott, who led the Gamecocks to a 1-10 record, the 
school's worst in 106 years. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, he paced the sidelines and pointed at officials as  
they called penalties against South Carolina -- as if he had never 
left. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did voice my opinion down there, because I was frustrated,''  
Holtz said. South Carolina was penalized seven times for 62 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Gamecocks fans hope Holtz will be able to make the team  
successful quickly, but most admit it will take some time. 
</P>
<P>
	``This year will be an improvement just because the players will  
be coached better,'' South Carolina alumnus Matt Cobb said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The biggest thing is getting recruits we haven't been able to  
get,'' added Smithfield, N.C., resident Clint Barrish, attending 
the game with South Carolina fans. 
</P>
<P>
	Holtz said since joining the Gamecocks, his goals are to recruit  
good players from South Carolina, beat a fellow Southeastern 
Conference team like Florida, Tennessee or Georgia soon and take 
the team to its first major bowl game. 
</P>
<P>
	He accomplished the first goal by signing South Carolina's ``Mr.  
Football,'' tailback Derek Watson. 
</P>
<P>
	Holtz's coaching career goes back to 1969 when he started at  
William &AMP; Mary, and then went to N.C. State, the New York Jets for 
one season, Arkansas, Minnesota and Notre Dame. At Minnesota, he 
also took over a 1-10 team after the 1983 season. 
</P>
<P>
	His first team at N.C. State, the 1972 squad, amassed a  
school-record 4,758 yards of total offense and scored 409 points. 
He took the Wolfpack to four straight bowl games, and his four 
teams were 20-1-1 at home and 10-1 in night games.

<HEADLINE> Fast Food Sales Soar in Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- Despite the economic slump,  
international fast-food chains in Thailand are reporting sharp 
sales increases and plan to expand their local outlets, a newspaper 
reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The chains, including Kentucky Fried Chicken, McDonald's and  
Pizza Hut, averaged a 15 percent sales growth during the first half 
of the year, as compared to a 12 percent drop for all of 1998, The 
Nation newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	American-style fast food has become solidly entrenched in  
Thailand despite its relatively high prices and a wealth of 
traditional Thai-style snacks available in roadside stands. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers tightened their belts following the mid-1997 economic  
crisis, but spending in some areas has increased with signs of a 
partial recovery on the horizon. 
</P>
<P>
	The fast food leader, Kentucky Fried Chicken, has allocated $2.6  
million to open 17 more outlets this year and forecasts that sales 
for the year will increase from last year's $89.5 million to $118.4 
million, according to the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	McDonald's, which plans to add seven more restaurants this year,  
enjoyed a 26 percent sales growth in the first seven months of 
1999, while Pizza Hut saw second quarter profits rise by 20.1 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Kentucky Fried Chicken has a 26 percent share of the fast food  
market, followed by McDonald's with 12 percent and Pizza Hut with 
11 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The total market is estimated to be worth more than $395  
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Kentucky Fried Chicken is expected to have 237 outlets and  
McDonald's 74 by the end of the year.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Denies Helping Govt Snoop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Microsoft Corp. says it's not conspiring with  
the federal government to allow a spy agency to read what's on your 
personal computer. 
</P>
<P>
	The claim against the maker of the popular Windows software was  
originally brought by security consultant Andrew Fernandes of 
Mississauga, Ontario, on his Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	It spread quickly in e-mail and discussion groups across the  
Internet, especially in those corners of cyberspace where Microsoft 
and the federal government are often criticized. 
</P>
<P>
	The charge of the alliance between Microsoft and the federal  
National Security Agency came after Fernandes stumbled across an 
obscure digital ``signing key'' that had been labeled the ``NSA 
key'' in the latest version of Microsoft's business-level Windows 
NT software. 
</P>
<P>
	An organization with such a signature key accepted by Windows  
could theoretically load software to make it easier to look at 
sensitive data -- such as e-mail or financial records -- that had 
been scrambled. The flaw would affect almost any version of 
Windows, the software that runs most of the world's personal 
computers. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft forcefully denied that it gave any government agency  
such a key, and explained that it called its function an ``NSA 
key'' because that federal agency reviews technical details for the 
export of powerful data-scrambling software. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are just used to ensure that we're compliant with U.S.  
export regulations,'' said Scott Culp, Microsoft's security manager 
for its Windows NT Server software. ``We have not shared the 
private keys. We do not share our keys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The claim against Microsoft, originally leveled by security  
consultant Andrew Fernandes of Mississauga, Ontario, on his Web 
site, spread quickly in e-mail and discussion groups across the 
Internet, especially in those corners of cyberspace where Microsoft 
and the federal government are often criticized. 
</P>
<P>
	Culp called Fernandes' claims ``completely false.''  
</P>
<P>
	An NSA spokesman declined immediate comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Bruce Schneier, a cryptography expert, said the claim by  
Fernandes ``makes no sense'' because a government agency as 
sophisticated as the NSA doesn't need Microsoft's help to 
unscramble sensitive computer information. 
</P>
<P>
	``That it allows the NSA to load unauthorized security services,  
compromise your operating system -- that's nonsense,'' said 
Schneier, who runs Counterpane Internet Security Inc. ``The NSA can 
already do that, and it has nothing to do with this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fernandes, who runs a small consulting firm, said he found the  
suspiciously named ``NSA key'' -- along with another key for 
Microsoft -- while examining the software code within the latest 
version of Windows NT. 
</P>
<P>
	The existence of the second key was discovered earlier by other  
cryptographers, but Fernandes was the first to find its official 
name and theorize about its purpose. 
</P>
<P>
	``That (the U.S. government) has ... installed a cryptographic  
back door in the world's most abundant operating system should send 
a strong message to foreign (information technology) managers,'' he 
warned on his Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	But Fernandes seemed less worried Friday in a telephone  
interview. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know that they have reason to lie,'' he said. ``The  
main point is, you can't really trust what they're saying. They've 
been caught with their hand in the cookie jar. In fact, I think 
they're being fairly honest, but you don't know what else is in 
Windows.''

<HEADLINE> Daughter Turns in Energy Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A senior policy adviser at the Energy  
Department and his wife, a well known anti-nuclear activist and 
lawyer, have been charged with growing and possessing marijuana 
after their 16-year-old daughter turned them in. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Alvarez and his wife, Kathleen Tucker, turned themselves  
in to Takoma Park, Md. police on Monday, 11 days after their 
daughter, Kerry Tucker, told police the couple had drugs in their 
basement. They were released on their own recognizance. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple's lawyer, Steven Kupferberg, told The Washington Post  
that the charges ``will eventually be lowered to simple 
possession.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kupferberg said Tucker uses the marijuana to treat migraines and  
chronic muscle pain. He said their daughter was staying with family 
friends by order of a Montgomery County District Court judge. 
</P>
<P>
	Alvarez was fired from his politically appointed job at the  
Energy Department after their arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	Tucker helped bring national attention to the plight of Karen  
Silkwood, a lab worker at the Kerr-McGee Cimarron Plutonium Plant 
in Oklahoma who died in a suspicious car crash in 1974 after she 
went public with alleged safety problems at the plant. Her story 
was made into a film starring Meryl Streep. 
</P>
<P>
	Tucker went on to head the Health and Energy Institute, an  
advocacy group in Washington that deals with radiation health 
issues.

	DuQUOIN, Ill. (AP) -- Enjoy Lavec beat Self Possessed by a head  
in the deciding race off then survived an inquiry to win the 
$530,000 World Trotting Derby at the Illinois State Fair on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Both horses had won a heat in the event for 3-year-olds so the  
third heat became a match race in which Enjoy Lavec, driven by 
Johnny Takter, covered the mile in 1:53.1. 
</P>
<P>
	The horses were even in deep stretch, but Enjoy Lavec got a head  
in front just a few strides from the wire. The trip to collect the 
trophy was delayed when the judges called for an inquiry regarding 
Enjoy Lavec bearing out toward Self Possessed in deep stretch. 
Enjoy Lavec's victory was declared official when no evidence of 
interference was found. 
</P>
<P>
	Self Possessed, the winner of the Hambletonian, won the first  
heat in a stakes record 1:52, finishing 2 1/2 lengths in front of 
stablemate Angus Hall. 
</P>
<P>
	In the second heat, Self Possessed, driven by Mike Lachance,  
could not hold off Enjoy Lavec down the stretch. Enjoy Lavec won by 
a length and tied the record set in the earlier heat.

<HEADLINE> Dennis Spawns Tornado in Va. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAMPTON, Va. (AP) -- A tornado packing winds up to 120 mph  
damaged an assisted living center, a nursing home and five 
apartment complexes on Saturday, injuring more than a dozen people 
and displacing as many as 1,000, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of residents of the Devonshire assisted-living center  
and the Wyndham, Township and Signature Way apartment complexes 
were evacuated in Hampton school buses to Red Cross shelters in 
nearby Ivy Memorial Baptist Church and Eaton Middle School. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 100 Devonshire residents later were transferred to  
Mayfair House, another assisted living center in Hampton. 
</P>
<P>
	Sandie Farrow, assistant administrator of the Devonshire home,  
said five residents were in the dining room when the tornado hit. 
They were cut by flying glass and taken to a hospital for 
treatment. The dining room was destroyed, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Twelve people with minor injuries were treated and released at  
Sentara Hampton General Hospital, a spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Frances Taycsik, 89, who has lived at Devonshire for four years,  
said she was talking on the phone when the tornado struck. ``... 
All of a sudden the windows opened and all we heard was a loud 
whish-bang. The girl on the phone said, `What was that?' I said, `I 
don't know but we better hang up.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The twister left up to 1,000 apartment residents without  
shelter. 
</P>
<P>
	Another tornado earlier damaged a barn and snapped utility polls  
in nearby Chesapeake, said Capt. Steve Johnson of the city's fire 
department. No one was injured, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	NWS forecaster Tim Armstrong said the tornadic winds were  
spawned by Tropical Storm Dennis, which had hovered off the North 
Carolina coast for a week before blowing shore late Saturday 
afternoon.

<HEADLINE> CART's Tracy, Andretti Talk Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- After a series of on-track  
run-ins, Paul Tracy and Michael Andretti appear to have settled 
their differences. 
</P>
<P>
	The CART FedEx Series drivers traded pointed comments two weeks  
ago after crashing while battling for third place early in the 
Target Grand Prix at Chicago Motor Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	The crash was costly to both drivers, putting them far behind  
series leader Juan Montoya and runner-up Dario Franchitti in the 
season points. 
</P>
<P>
	Tracy, who was barred from competing in the season-opening race  
at Homestead, Fla., because of hitting Andretti's car during last 
fall's race in Australia, decided it was time to talk with the 
former series champion. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've never spoken before,'' Tracy said. ``There have been  
some problems and we've had a lot of bad blood between us. I called 
him to see if we could talk it out. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told him I didn't call to get in an argument. He listened  
and we cleared the air. We agreed we both need to give each other 
enough room on the racetrack.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Andretti said, ``Basically, we just discussed the fact that we  
have to be able to both go into a corner together and come out of 
the corner together. It's not a question of giving in. It's just a 
question of giving each other space. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not asking him to let me by,'' he said. ``I'm just asking  
him to give me room, and I will do the same.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wally Dallenbach, CART's chief steward, had urged Tracy and  
Andretti to talk out their differences and was so happy with the 
results that he canceled a meeting with the drivers Friday. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *SUPER SUB:* Roberto Moreno appears ready to give up his ``Super  
Sub'' label. 
</P>
<P>
	The Brazilian has kept his open-wheel racing career going since  
the beginning of the 1998 season by filling in for injured drivers 
or taking part-time rides with struggling teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Moreno ran the first two races of last season for the  
underfunded Project Indy team, then sat out the rest of the year, 
except for filling in at Newman-Haas Racing for Christian 
Fittipaldi in Milwaukee after Fittipaldi sustained a concussion. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, Moreno drove two races, including the Indianapolis  
500, in the rival Indy Racing League, then returned to CART, 
filling in for eight races for injured Mark Blundell. 
</P>
<P>
	Blundell returned to the cockpit last month in Detroit, but  
Moreno filled in again for Fittipaldi, who was hurt in a testing 
accident. Fittipaldi is expected to return for the Houston race 
Sept. 26, again leaving Moreno without a ride. 
</P>
<P>
	``You go race by race and don't think that far down the road,''  
Moreno said. ``The other guys are thinking about the championship. 
I'm just thinking about getting a job for next year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moreno is in negotiations with an unidentified CART team and  
hopes to announce a full-time deal for 2000 after next Sunday's 
race at Monterey, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *TRIPLE THREAT:* The Player's Forsythe team will test three  
drivers before deciding on a replacement for Greg Moore, who is 
leaving for Marlboro Penske Racing next season. 
</P>
<P>
	Neil Micklewright, vice president of operations for Gerry  
Forsythe's team, said Canadian drivers Lee Bentham, Alexandre 
Tagliani and David Empringham will each have a two-day test on the 
road course at Sebring, Fla., later this month. 
</P>
<P>
	``The drivers are aware that this isn't a contest to find out  
who does the fastest lap,'' Micklewright said. ``They will be 
evaluated on such aspects as the consistency of their lap times, 
their ability to adapt to certain situations like entering and 
leaving the pit area, driving in a fuel-saving model, bringing 
tires to temperature, etc. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE>  Canada, Quebec Tense at Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONCTON, New Brunswick (AP) -- Tensions between the Canadian  
government and separatist Quebec flared Saturday at a three-day 
gathering of French-speaking countries, where both are hosting 
francophone leaders from around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	The incident began when the newspaper Montreal Le Devoir  
reported that Canada's Department of Foreign Affairs had 
distributed a manual to its diplomatic corps detailing possible 
questions about the sovereigntist movement and how to answer them 
properly. 
</P>
<P>
	Quebec Premier Lucien Bouchard, a one-time Canadian ambassador  
to France, sharply criticized the manual. He said the government 
had gone too far in combatting the independence-minded Quebecois 
and was wasting taxpayers' money. 
</P>
<P>
	As a Canadian official in France, ``I never spoke badly of  
Quebec. And I never spoke badly of the sovereigntist movement,'' 
Bouchard said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always made sure that the Canadian embassy was for everyone,  
no matter what their political opinions were,'' he said. ``I never 
thought that in becoming a diplomat I would become a political 
commando.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien told reporters that  
the memo was nothing out of the ordinary. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very normal that the ambassadors will give the score when  
they're abroad,'' he said. ``They have to tell the truth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The issue was the first glitch between Ottawa and Quebec at the  
summit, although Quebec lawmakers in the federal Parliament weren't 
allowed to be part of the Canadian delegation, deputy Francine 
Lalonde said. 
</P>
<P>
	Both the federal government and Quebec, along with  
French-speaking New Brunswick, are hosting the conference of La 
Francophonie. The organization promotes French language and culture 
among its 52 members. Most of the member nations are former French 
colonies in Africa.

<HEADLINE> Report: Madonna Mulls French School </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Madonna, who has been house-hunting in London,  
reportedly wants to send her daughter, Lourdes, to an exclusive 
French school in England. 
</P>
<P>
	The 2-year-old got a spot on the waiting list for the Lycee  
Francais Charles de Gaulle school, The Sun reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuition for the school, which caters mostly to French families  
living and working in London, costs the equivalent of $1,600 a 
term. 
</P>
<P>
	Lourdes is expected to start school there at age 4, the  
newspaper said, adding that her mother likes the idea of giving her 
daughter an international education. 
</P>
<P>
	``Madonna is fluent in Italian and very good at French and  
Spanish,'' The Sun quoted an unidentified friend as saying. ``She 
has found her languages invaluable and is determined that Lourdes 
gets the opportunity to be immersed in a different culture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at the Charles de Gaulle school could not be reached  
for comment Saturday.

<HEADLINE> High Yield Wins Hopeful at Saratoga </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. (AP) -- High Yield looked like a million  
dollars winning Saratoga's Hopeful Stakes by five lengths Saturday. 
That was appropriate for a horse whose purchase price was $1 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Carrying 122 pounds, as did all nine starters, and ridden by  
Jerry Bailey, the colt looked sharp in winning the $200,000 test 
for 2-year-olds. 
</P>
<P>
	Settlement, who was away late, made an impressive late run to  
finish second, three lengths ahead of Exciting Story. The order of 
finish was completed by Sykes Alive, Afternoon Affair, Trouble 
City, Buffalo Prayer, Z Cool and Chancellor M.H. 
</P>
<P>
	For winning trainer D. Wayne Lukas, it was the fourth Hopeful  
win in the last 10 runnings of the race. Lukas' other winners were 
Deposit Ticket in 1990, Salt Lake in 1991 and Hennessy in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	After breaking fifth, High Yield moved into contention along the  
inside, just behind Exciting Story and Sykes Alive, then caught the 
early leaders nearing the stretch. Once into the final straight, 
High Yield took command to win with authority in 1:22 4-5 for seven 
furlongs. 
</P>
<P>
	Lukas was delighted.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's quite a bit better than he was (at Hollywood Park earlier  
in the year),'' Lukas said. ``He's seasoned beyond the starts he's 
had. He's a very strong, athletic horse. I think that the best is 
still in front of him. There's room to improve quite a bit. Today 
was very encouraging. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're looking at one race before the Breeders' Cup (Nov. 6 at  
Gulfstream Park). I would like to get a two-turn race, but I 
wouldn't rule out the Champagne (Oct. 9 at Belmont Park).'' 
</P>
<P>
	High Yield's part owner, Robert Lewis, 75, underwent heart  
bypass surgery two days ago at Pomona Valley Community Hospital in 
Pomona, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	High Yield's win was his second straight in his fourth career  
start and was worth $120,000. 
</P>
<P>
	He returned $5.70, $4.10 and $3.30. Settlement paid $7.10 and  
$4.80 and Exciting Story was $4.20 to show.

<HEADLINE> Russian Businessman Indicted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Federal authorities have accused a Russian  
businessman of defrauding investors out of more than $1.5 million, 
allegedly using the same bank Russian mobsters chose to launder 
money through. 
</P>
<P>
	An indictment against Alexander Lushtak, 33, was filed Wednesday  
and unsealed Friday in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	Lushtak allegedly laundered money through the Bank of New York,  
which authorities say was used by Russian organized crime bosses to 
launder money. 
</P>
<P>
	The indictment does not charge Lushtak with being involved in  
the larger money laundering scheme, said U.S. attorney's spokesman 
Matt Jacobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Barry Portman, Lushtak's attorney, also said there was no  
connection between Lushtak and the other case, which may have 
involved billions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a run-of-the-mill fraud case,'' said Portman, describing  
the charges against Lushtak. Lushtak maintains his innocence, 
Portman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lushtak is being held by federal authorities until a bail  
hearing Sept. 7. 
</P>
<P>
	A Bank of New York spokesman said Friday that the bank was  
reviewing the Lushtak indictment and cooperating with authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	The indictment alleges that Lushtak and his company, A &AMP; A  
Financial Management of San Francisco, persuaded investors he could 
deliver high rates of return. Lushtak then used a Ponzi-like scheme 
to take money from new investors and to pay earlier investors, it 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The businessman was accused of pocketing all the extra money,  
paying off his Nevada gambling debt and building a house in 
Tiburon, a high-priced suburb on San Francisco Bay.

<HEADLINE> Small Turnout for Peaceful NYC Rally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The second Million Youth March drew about 2,000  
people to the streets of Harlem on Saturday after weeks of 
name-calling and a legal tug-of-war between organizers and city 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
	The rally was calm in contrast to last year's march, which ended  
in a bottle-throwing melee and 28 injuries after police in riot 
gear tried to enforce a court-ordered curfew. 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers opened Saturday's rally with a prayer, and most of  
the speakers offered uplifting messages encouraging black youths to 
stay in school and to treat one another with dignity. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whose streets? Our streets!'' shouted one group of marchers,  
although most of the participants were more subdued. Paulette 
Washington, who works in Harlem, was walking with a sandwich board 
with the words: ``Execute racism.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If we can't live together, we'll die together,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	The rally was monitored by 1,500 police officers, some stationed  
on rooftops. They did not arrive in riot gear this year, and there 
were about half as many officers as in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	No conflicts were reported.  
</P>
<P>
	Prior to this year's march, organizer Khallid Abdul Muhammad  
labeled Mayor Rudolph Giuliani a ``cracker'' after the mayor called 
the rally a ``hate march.'' Organizers took the city to court to 
get a permit for the rally when city officials turned them down, as 
they did in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's crowd was barely a third of last year's turnout of  
6,000. Reporters covering the event estimated there were about 
2,000 people; police estimated there were under 1,000. Harlem 
politicians had encouraged a boycott of the march after Muhammad -- 
a former Nation of Islam spokesman fired for his anti-Semitic 
comments -- made inflammatory statements during the Million Youth 
March's debut last year. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, Giuliani thanked New Yorkers for the relatively  
low turnout. ``Today, New Yorkers demonstrated by their absence, 
their overwhelming support for tolerance and decency,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	During his hour-long speech, Muhammad attacked Giuliani,  
labeling those who called for a boycott ``Uncle Toms,'' and 
accusing Jews of sanctioning slavery. Muhammad's address ended the 
rally, with the crowd dispersing quietly. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney Malik Shabazz, another rally organizer, held up a  
picture of the mayor at the rally Saturday and told the crowd, ``We 
charge this man with crimes against the black nation!'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Guilty! Guilty!'' some shouted back.  
</P>
<P>
	Shabazz also made anti-Semitic remarks and told the crowd, ``The  
only solution any time there is a funeral in the black community is 
a funeral in the police community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While some in the crowd applauded the speakers and joined a  
chant of ``Black power,'' others along Malcolm X Boulevard were 
apathetic. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't both me as long as it goes smoothly,'' said Gloria  
Johnson. ``It's OK to have a Million Youth March as long as it's 
done with finesse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two teens from the Bronx, Devon Speaks and Robert Pitts, said  
they attended the rally to judge it for themselves. Neither had 
much positive to say about Muhammad. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think what he has to say is a lot of foolishness,'' said  
Pitts, 14.

<HEADLINE> S. Williams Survives at U.S. Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Her father was saying it all week -- Serena  
Williams is destined to make up half of the U.S. Open women's 
final. 
</P>
<P>
	That date with sister Venus came close to being canceled  
Saturday by another precocious teen -- 16-year-old Belgian Kim 
Clijsters -- until Serena strung together 14 straight points, and 
won 16 of the last 17, to salvage a 4-6, 6-2, 7-5 victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, 17, refused to give in as Clijsters served for the  
match at 5-3. Williams broke her at love, drilled four big serves 
to hold at love, then broke Clijsters at love again before putting 
it away to match her best Grand Slam result, a fourth-round 
appearance at the 1998 French Open. 
</P>
<P>
	The No. 7 seeded Williams came in with more muscle and more  
hype, but made a slew of mistakes against an opponent who was 
unfazed by the Williams mystique. Clijsters, No. 98, put Williams 
on notice in the first set with an array of stinging winners that 
impressed the crowd and punctured Williams' pride. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was playing great,'' Williams said of Clijsters' early  
effort. ``She doesn't have any weak shots. She does a lot of things 
very well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams found herself down 0-2 in the second set before she  
began to match Clijsters' shots. Williams reduced her unforced 
errors from 27 in the first set to five in the second. 
</P>
<P>
	In the final set, overconfidence burdened Williams again while  
Clijsters regained control. By outslugging Williams at the baseline 
and taking advantage of Williams' three double-faults, Clijsters 
had a chance to close out the match on serve at 5-3. 
</P>
<P>
	It looked like another quick Grand Slam exit for Williams, who  
lost in the third rounds of the Australian and the French this 
year. But Clijsters served shakily, and Williams jumped on the 
opportunity with wicked returns. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's when my determination really kicked in,'' said  
Williams, who next meets No. 16 Conchita Martinez. ``I was really 
tired of going out early in the Slams.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clijsters regretted rushing at the wrong moment.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm always rushing,'' Clijsters said. ``She returned good and  
I had to put more first serves in. I was pushing myself. Maybe 
there was a little bit of pressure on me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was plenty of pressure on Williams also, who called the  
comeback her biggest in a major event. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was definitely pretty magnificent the way I was able to  
be determined and come back and just really stay focused like 
that,'' Williams said. ``I don't recall having done that before.''

<HEADLINE> Reeves Among Broncos' Final Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- One day after his team's 34-3 preseason-ending  
romp over San Francisco, Denver Broncos coach Mike Shanahan began 
trimming his roster to the required 53 players. 
</P>
<P>
	NFL teams must finalize their cuts on Sunday.  
</P>
<P>
	Although Shanahan declined to disclose any names on Saturday,  
saying he still hasn't contacted every player affected, four 
players confirmed to the media that they had been waived. 
</P>
<P>
	Leaving Broncos headquarters with a garbage bag full of their  
belongings on Saturday morning were defensive end Carl Reeves, 
offensive tackle Tony Berti, wide receiver Taj Johnson and 
linebacker Dave Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
	The Broncos must cut another 12 players to reach the limit.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was a numbers game,'' said Reeves, almost relieved to have  
the suspense over. ``They have a lot of good defensive ends here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he was told that it came down to him or rookie Montae  
Reagor or veteran Neil Smith, Reeves said, ``I'm not sure about 
that. Either way, I'm on my way home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he wasn't surprised at his release ``because I didn't  
get a lot of playing time in practice or the games. But this is a 
great organization, and they taught me a lot about how to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves, who played the previous three seasons with the Chicago  
Bears and was signed by the Broncos as a free agent in the 
offseason, said he'll wait by the phone to see if other teams are 
interested in his services. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll go wherever the wind takes me, wherever I'm needed,'' he  
said. ``So if you all know anybody who needs a defensive end, tell 
them to give me a holler.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shanahan said he ``talked to a number of players today but I  
haven't talked to everybody. We have, however, made our cutdowns, 
and they will be announced by noon (Sunday).'' 
</P>
<P>
	As expected, safety Tori Noel will be placed on injured reserve  
because of a season-ending neck injury. And quarterback John Elway, 
who retired last spring but who has remained on the roster as the 
Broncos pursued various salary-cap possibilities, went on the 
retired list. 
</P>
<P>
	``This will be the first time John was ever released,'' Shanahan  
said. ``If we kept him on the roster, it would be strictly for 
salary-cap purposes, to help us with the salary cap. We know John 
is retired.''

<HEADLINE> United 4, Burn 1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Marco Etcheverry scored two goals and Jamie  
Moreno added a goal and three assists as D.C. United beat the 
Dallas Burn 4-1 Saturday night for their eighth straight MLS 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Roy Lassiter added two assists for United (20-7), which snapped  
the Burn's three-game winning streak and closed the season-series 
between the teams at 1-1. 
</P>
<P>
	United reached 50 points, coming closer to securing home-field  
advantage through the Eastern Conference playoffs with five games 
left. Washington also prevented Dallas (14-13) from gaining third 
place in the Western Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas is still the only MLS team with an all-time winning  
record against United, 6-5. But the win let United avenge a 3-0 
loss to the Burn on June 16, Washington's worst loss ever. 
</P>
<P>
	Lassiter earned his 41st and 42nd points on the season, snapping  
a tie for first place in league scoring with the Burn's Jason 
Kreis, who was shut out. 
</P>
<P>
	United, which overcame a soggy field, posted two goals in a  
seven-minute span in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
	Moreno scored first in the 17th minute, his eighth goal of the  
season. After Etcheverry's free kick from outside the penalty box 
hit the side bar, goalie Matt Jordan blocked Lassiter's shot. But 
Moreno punched in the rebound. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan again deflected a Lassiter kick in the 24th minute.  
Etcheverry, however, put United up 2-0 with his third goal of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Five minutes later, Dallas' Ariel Graziani closed the gap,  
slipping a shot to the right of goalie Tom Presthus. 
</P>
<P>
	Less than two minutes into the second half, Etcheverry put  
United up 3-1, rifling a shot just to Jordan's left after taking 
Moreno's centering pass. Lassiter also assisted.

<HEADLINE> Burton Likes Darlington Tradition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DARLINGTON, S.C. (AP) -- Jeff Burton likes tradition, and he  
can't think of many places that offer much more than Darlington 
Raceway -- especially on Labor Day weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Burton won the TranSouth 400 over the egg-shaped oval  
they call The Lady in Black last March, he considers that just 
another race at the old country track. Mention the Southern 500, 
and the 32-year-old Virginian's tone becomes one of reverence. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Southern 500 is the next level up,'' said Burton, who on  
Sunday will try to win the oldest NASCAR race. ``I don't want to 
downplay the win in the spring, because that was a big deal, but 
the Southern 500 is history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yes, and Burton wants to become more than a footnote in its 50th  
running. But he says milestones have nothing to do with that. 
</P>
<P>
	Only a handful of professional sports arenas are older than the  
1.366-mile track, where the first big-time stock car race was run 
in 1950. 
</P>
<P>
	``Darlington is like playing at Fenway Park ... Cameron Indoor  
Stadium ... Soldier Field,'' he said. ``It's history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's also the toughest track for most Winston Cup drivers, but  
one Burton has mastered. In addition to winning the TranSouth 400, 
he has waged stirring duels with Jeff Gordon before finishing 
second in each of the past two Southern 500s. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Darlington plays into our hands,'' said Burton, who  
starts 15th in the $2.2 million race. ``We seem to be good on race 
tracks that get slippery and are abusive on tires.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That description also fits Gordon, who is trying to become the  
first driver to win the same 500-mile race five straight times. A 
victory also would tie Cale Yarborough's record of five Southern 
500 wins. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon knows all about history, and like Burton worships the old  
track that took its odd shape from the proximity of Ramsey's Pond. 
But beating Darlington -- where the drivers race the track, not each 
other -- is his biggest reward. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anytime you win at Darlington, it's special,'' said Gordon,  
who will start from the fourth spot on the grid as he tries for his 
sixth career win on the high-banked track. ``This place has a lot 
of prestige among the drivers and people in the garage area. 
</P>
<P>
	``For drivers and teams that win here, it carries a lot of  
respect among your peers. That probably means as much as 
anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon has won by following the same plan as Burton. Both say  
tire management is the key at Darlington. 
</P>
<P>
	And, Gordon says, tires won't last if the car isn't right. He  
likes the one he'll drive Sunday, calling it a great car. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll try to get a setup underneath and find a way to get  
these tires to last as long as they possibly can,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Gordon wanted the pole, he is not upset to be starting  
in the second row. At Darlington, most passing is done because a 
consistent pace eventually makes a car faster than one that has 
been driven too fast for too long. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon has seen that happen repeatedly, and says starting  
position can have something to do with that. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes, starting on the pole or the front row, you take off  
early and wear out your tires and go backwards,'' he said. ``I'd 
like to be able to get in position to save my tires and work on 
them as the run goes on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The third member of the Darlington dominators, two-time  
TranSouth 400 winner and series points leader Dale Jarrett, might 
not become a factor Sunday. He qualified 36th, and history suggests 
he can't win. 
</P>
<P>
	Only once in 92 Darlington races has the winner started worse  
than 23rd. 
</P>
<P>
	Jarrett's teammate with Robert Yates Racing, Kenny Irwin, has  
the pole in a Ford. Burton's brother, Ward, is on the outside of 
the front row in a Pontiac. 
</P>
<P>
	Inside the Chevrolet of Gordon is the Pontiac of Jerry Nadeau.  
Bobby Hamilton, rookie Elliott Sadler, Bobby Labonte, Mike Skinner, 
Kevin Lepage and Bill Elliott complete the top 10.

<HEADLINE> Daughter Turns in Energy Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A senior policy adviser at the Energy  
Department and his wife, a well known anti-nuclear activist and 
lawyer, have been charged with growing and possessing marijuana 
after their 16-year-old daughter turned them in. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Alvarez and his wife, Kathleen Tucker, turned themselves  
in to Takoma Park, Md. police on Monday, 11 days after their 
daughter, Kerry Tucker, told police the couple had drugs in their 
basement. They were released on their own recognizance. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple's lawyer, Steven Kupferberg, told The Washington Post  
that the charges ``will eventually be lowered to simple 
possession.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kupferberg said Tucker uses the marijuana to treat migraines and  
chronic muscle pain. He said their daughter was staying with family 
friends by order of a Montgomery County District Court judge. 
</P>
<P>
	Alvarez was fired from his politically appointed job at the  
Energy Department after their arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	Tucker helped bring national attention to the plight of Karen  
Silkwood, a lab worker at the Kerr-McGee Cimarron Plutonium Plant 
in Oklahoma who died in a suspicious car crash in 1974 after she 
went public with alleged safety problems at the plant. Her story 
was made into a film starring Meryl Streep. 
</P>
<P>
	Tucker went on to head the Health and Energy Institute, an  
advocacy group in Washington that deals with radiation health 
issues.

<HEADLINE> Ann-Margret Plays Victimized Grandma </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- For those of a certain age, it may  
be hard to imagine Ann-Margret playing a dowdy grandmother involved 
in a small-town serial killing. 
</P>
<P>
	Well, those people need to brace themselves.  
</P>
<P>
	The 1960s movie sex kitten is playing her own age -- 58 -- as  
Lorraine Petrovich, who watches too much TV, lives with an abusive 
38-year-old man and winds up convicted as an accessory to the 
murders for which the boyfriend takes the rap. 
</P>
<P>
	``Happy Face Murders,'' which appears on Showtime Sept. 5 at 8  
p.m. EDT, is based on a real-life case involving an Oregon woman, 
Laverne Pavlinac. Despite the title, there's nothing lighthearted 
about the movie; ``Happy Face'' refers to the symbols used by the 
murderer. 
</P>
<P>
	Dowdy, aged or evil, Ann-Margret isn't afraid to take roles that  
are counter to her attractive image. Like Bette Davis, Ann-Margret 
believes it's the role that counts, not how she looks. 
</P>
<P>
	Lorraine's cluttered bungalow in the film looks nothing like the  
home that Ann-Margret shares with her husband and personal manager, 
former actor Roger Smith. It was once the home of Humphrey Bogart, 
Lauren Bacall and their two children. (The isolation suited Bogart, 
but his wife forced a move because the children had no neighbors 
with whom to play.) 
</P>
<P>
	The house, approached by a winding road, sits on a plateau above  
Beverly Hills. The gardens are ablaze with summer blossoms, and the 
living room is equally colorful: a huge painting of flowers over 
the hand-carved wooden fireplace; impressionist-style landscapes on 
other walls; palms, ficus trees, lilies and violets; a large bay 
with grand piano and crystal chandelier, and outside the windows, 
jacaranda trees in full purple blossom. 
</P>
<P>
	Adjacent to the living room is an office with floor to ceiling  
photos of Ann-Margret in film roles and on magazine covers. Smith 
was working at the computer, for which he had the keyboard adjusted 
to produce a clacking noise. 
</P>
<P>
	``Roger worked so long on a typewriter that he missed its  
sound,'' she explains. 
</P>
<P>
	For many years he has been afflicted with myasthenia gravis, a  
nerve disease characterized by weakness and quick fatigue of 
muscles, especially of the face and neck. Smith has good days and 
bad days; this is one of his good days. 
</P>
<P>
	He shows little sign of the disease, looking as handsome as when  
he starred on TV in ``Mr. Roberts'' and ``77 Sunset Strip.'' He 
gave up acting after marrying Ann-Margret in 1967, and he is 
credited with shrewd handling of her long career. She is ever 
vigilant of his condition; if there's a string of bad days, she 
will decline work to be with him. 
</P>
<P>
	Sitting in her tasteful home, Ann-Margret looks wildly removed  
from the gray-haired grandmother of her TV movie. Appearing svelte 
and glamorous as always, she was dressed in black, low-cut lounging 
pajamas with a silk coat in a bright floral print that seemed to 
match the decor of her living room. 
</P>
<P>
	She recently had her debut as a lecturer, touring Calgary and  
Edmonton, Canada. She shows clips from her movies and reminisces 
about her life in the studios. Of course, everyone wants to know 
what it was like working with Elvis. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had never done anything like that,'' she said of the  
lecturing. ``For the first 20 minutes, my voice was shaking. When 
the response came, I started relaxing. In the last 15 minutes, when 
I sat down with a moderator, I said, 'You guys! I'm so relaxed I'm 
ready to do a somersault.''' 
</P>
<P>
	But she doesn't plan to put her musical act together and take it  
on the road anymore. Her last tour was almost five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was too hard,'' she said. ``We had like 35 people. We  
brought carpenters -- the world with us. Every night in a different 
place -- and just putting up the sound took a few hours. 
</P>
<P>
	``I remember playing one night in Indiana, then arriving at 3 in  
the afternoon in Buffalo, where it was already dark and snowing 
like mad. I don't know how we got the sound together, but at 8 
o'clock we were ready and had a great time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ann-Margret has had a remarkably varied career. Born Ann-Margret  
Olsson in Sweden, she arrived in Illinois at 5 and at 15 had scored 
a hit on TV's ``Ted Mack's Amateur Hour.'' She quit Midwestern 
University after a year to sing with traveling bands. In 1961, she 
made her film debut as Bette Davis' daughter in ``Pocketful of 
Miracles,'' Frank Capra's last feature. 
</P>
<P>
	After a successful run in movies as a sex symbol and musical  
star, she surprised everyone with her dramatics in Mike Nichols' 
``Carnal Knowledge,'' for which she received an Academy Award 
nomination. She also was an Oscar nominee for the rock opera 
``Tommy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She has continued a busy career, both in TV movies and  
theatrical features. This fall, she'll be seen in ``The Last 
Producer'' with Burt Reynolds and Oliver Stone's ``Any Given 
Sunday,'' in which she co-stars with Al Pacino.

<HEADLINE> Hungry Asian Beetle Menaces Trees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- An alien invader is casting a hungry eye on one  
of America's greatest natural resources. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a bug the size of a child's thumb, and already it has  
destroyed thousands of trees in New York and Chicago. What's worse, 
the Asian long-horned beetle can only be eliminated by destroying 
its victims -- killing the trees to save the forest. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is really our Public Enemy No. 1 in the pest world right  
now,'' said Michael Dunn, an Agriculture Department undersecretary 
overseeing the anti-beetle efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	Believed to have migrated in wooded crates from China, North  
America's first Asian long-horned beetles were discovered three 
years ago in Brooklyn, but they likely bored their way into the 
trees years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Recently, Asian long-horned beetles were found in Manhattan,  
just blocks from the city's green jewel, Central Park. Officials 
worry the beetles already may be ravaging some of the park's 26,000 
trees. 
</P>
<P>
	``They should be very afraid,'' said Cornell University  
entomologist Richard Hoebeke, an expert on the Asian long-horned 
beetle. ``It's alarming to know it's that close to Central Park.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 3,800 hardwood trees -- maple, elm, ash, willow, poplar,  
horse chestnut -- have been destroyed in New York City and around 
Amityville on Long Island. The toll in Chicago, the only other city 
known to have infestations, is close to 1,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts believe the beetle arrived in the mid-1980s by burrowing  
into wooden crates and palettes from China, where raw, 
insect-infested wood often is used to package exports. 
</P>
<P>
	The Agriculture Department banned untreated packaging from  
entering the United States last year. But officials still have to 
fight the beetles that already arrived and their offspring. 
</P>
<P>
	Because pesticides are powerless against the beetles, the only  
way to stop their spread is to uproot infested trees and burn the 
wood. Most of the trees would die anyway from the holes bored in 
their trunks. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents of Chicago's Ravenswood neighborhood have watched  
workers remove hundreds of trees since Asian long-horned beetles 
were discovered there last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``They literally went from tree-lined blocks with trees that  
were 40, 50, 60 years old, beautiful canopies over the street, to 
bare parkways,'' said Terry Levin, a spokesman for Chicago Mayor 
Richard Daley. 
</P>
<P>
	The voracious beetles, usually between an inch and two inches  
long, are coal black with white spots and long antennae. 
</P>
<P>
	Females chew through bark to lay their eggs. When the larvae  
hatch, they feed inside the tree for more than a year. Eventually 
they tunnel out, boring dime-sized holes in the trunks, and then 
restart the cycle. 
</P>
<P>
	The damage is almost always fatal.  
</P>
<P>
	The federal government has spent $10 million fighting  
infestations so far, and state and local governments have laid out 
millions more. Experts believe the problem may extend beyond New 
York and Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bomb is ticking,'' Hoebeke said. ``My guess is this beetle  
will turn up this year in some other major city.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bugs -- but no affected trees -- have been found at import  
warehouses in Houston; Seattle; Charleston, S.C.; Long Beach and 
Oakland, Calif.; Portland, Ore.; Toronto and Vancouver, Canada, 
among other cities. 
</P>
<P>
	Import hubs are most at risk. In Chicago, the infestation's  
epicenter was the backyard of a hardware company that received 
goods from China. Damaged trees were found this week in a forest 
preserve near O'Hare International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, a visitor last month spotted beetle damage in trees  
on a Manhattan playground half a mile from Central Park. The 
once-lush playground has gone from oasis to ``suntanning field,'' 
said Joseph Gittelman, who runs the USDA's beetle project on Long 
Island. 
</P>
<P>
	Workers removed 23 trees from the playground and are now  
examining Central Park's hardwoods. 
</P>
<P>
	Mindful of the ravages of Dutch elm disease, which decimated  
American elms, officials worry for millions of acres of woodlands, 
particularly in the Northeast and Canada, which have more of the 
beetle's favorite trees than the West. Maple syrup producers and 
the forestry industry are nervously tracking the beetle's progress. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know where it's going to all end,'' Hoebeke said.

<HEADLINE> Woof! Woof! The Browns Are Back </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Three long years, 21 if you're counting in Dawg  
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Life without the NFL was tough on Cleveland. Sundays weren't the  
same here. Neither were Mondays, Tuesdays or Wednesdays. 
</P>
<P>
	Heck, even hating the Pittsburgh Steelers wasn't the same. The  
Baltimore Ravens became the new enemy. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was as if you'd lost your best friend,'' said John  
Thompson, a k a Big Dawg, the leader of a 10,000-member pack of 
rabid fans known as the Dawg Pound. 
</P>
<P>
	``But now he's coming home.''  
</P>
<P>
	In the Year of the Retirement, finally a stirring comeback. One  
of the most storied names in American sports, the Cleveland Browns, 
are returning after being forced into retirement when former owner 
Art Modell took his team to Baltimore in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	You remember the Browns. Orange helmets with white stripes and  
no logos. White home jerseys. Paul Brown. Otto Graham. Jim Brown. 
Bernie Kosar. Dreary old Cleveland Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Well, the Browns are back as an expansion team in 1999. They'll  
look pretty much the same as they always did, but these aren't your 
dad's Browns. 
</P>
<P>
	They've got a new owner, a sparkling new $283 million stadium --  
built on the same spot as the old place -- a front office with a 
Super Bowl blueprint, rookie quarterback Tim Couch and a proud city 
so pumped to have football back that 30,000 fans showed up for the 
new Browns first practice in their new home. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're back,'' Big Dawg said. ``It's exciting. It's almost like  
the resurrection. It's not like an expansion team. It's like the 
same team is coming back with new life. And look at Cleveland, 
we're not the Mistake on the Lake anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland has changed dramatically. One of the country's great  
industrial cities, it became a national joke during the 1970s when 
the polluted Cuyahoga River caught fire and the Indians averaged 
100 losses a year. 
</P>
<P>
	But the city has undergone a remarkable renaissance. The Rock  
and Roll Hall of Fame has brought in tourists, who dine in the 
renovated Warehouse District, and if they can get a ticket, catch 
the Indians in sold out Jacobs Field. 
</P>
<P>
	All that had been missing were the Browns, who for years were  
the best thing about the town. Cleveland was always Browns Town, 
the unofficial capital of football-crazy Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's in our blood,'' said linebacker Chris Spielman, an Ohio  
native forced to retire two weeks before the Browns opener because 
of a neck injury. ``Like Louisiana has gumbo, we have football.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That changed on Nov. 6, 1995, when Modell, upset with city  
officials' refusal to build him a stadium as they had for the 
Indians and Cavaliers and unwilling to sell his team, announced 
from Baltimore he was moving the team there. 
</P>
<P>
	Back in Ohio, grown men raised on Browns football, wept openly.  
</P>
<P>
	``I can't tell you how much that hurt,'' bricklayer Richard  
Holloway said during the summer after putting in a tough day 
helping build the Cleveland Browns Stadium. ``Talk about shock.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shock and pain. A deep, deep pain. And a feeling of betrayal.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was as though they'd been cheated,'' said Browns president  
Carmen Policy, who got five Super Bowl rings working for the San 
Francisco 49ers. ``People refer to it like a death in the family. 
But it wasn't just a death in the family. It was like a family 
member had been murdered. It wasn't just a loss, it was a cruel and 
unfair loss.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland, though, wasn't about to let its heart get ripped out  
without a fight. And with Mayor Michael White leading the effort, 
Browns fans bombarded the NFL with faxes and marched on owners 
meetings trying to persuade the league to restore, not replace, 
their beloved team. 
</P>
<P>
	Big Dawg went to Washington, and broke down crying in front of a  
congressional committee as he tried to explain the injustice of it 
all. 
</P>
<P>
	Save Our Browns became Cleveland's campaign and war cry.  
</P>
<P>
	The sense of loss hit home with NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue,  
who remembered the heartbreak he felt when his Dodgers moved from 
Brooklyn. 
</P>
<P>
	Tagliabue wanted to put football back in one of the league's  
signature cities quickly, and less than two months after the Browns 
played their final game in Cleveland Stadium, NFL owners approved a 
deal that allowed Modell to leave. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland, in turn, got to keep its nickname, colors and  
history. 
</P>
<P>
	``It couldn't be any other way,'' said billionaire banker Al  
Lerner, who bought the team for $530 million last September. ``This 
town wouldn't stand for anything else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL has been trumpeting the Browns' return and scheduled  
their home opener for Sunday night of opening weekend on national 
TV against the Steelers. 
</P>
<P>
	From the time the league awarded Lerner ownership, the Browns  
had only 11 months to put the team in place before their first 
exhibition game. 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast, Carolina and Jacksonville had two years to get  
ready. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I took the job in January,'' Browns coach Chris Palmer  
said, ``I walked into my office and I didn't have a secretary, 
there were boxes all over the place. I thought, `Hey, what did I 
get myself into?' '' 
</P>
<P>
	Lerner put the team's future in the hands of Policy, who in turn  
put the Browns' football operations in the hands of Dwight Clark, 
famous for making ``The Catch'' in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	In January, the Browns' coaching search seemed to be going  
nowhere when Mike Holmgren, then Steve Mariucci and finally Brian 
Billick all slipped away. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Browns found their man in Palmer, Jacksonville's  
offensive coordinator who now seems as if he were destined to lead 
the Browns into a new football era. 
</P>
<P>
	Friendly with boundless energy, Palmer comes across as an  
English teacher in looks and daily preparation. Everything the 
Browns have done during the preseason has been planned out to the 
second by Palmer, much the way Cleveland coach Paul Brown worked 
during his days as an NFL coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer spent any free time this summer -- there wasn't much --  
rereading Brown's biography. 
</P>
<P>
	And before they took the field on the first day of training  
camp, the new Browns got a history lesson as Palmer showed them a 
highlight film on the old Browns. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted them to understand what it means to put that helmet  
on every day,'' Palmer said. ``To know what it means to play for 
the Cleveland Browns.''

	HAMPTON, Va. (AP) -- A tornado struck southeastern Virginia on  
Saturday as Tropical Storm Dennis neared the coast, damaging an 
assisted living center and several apartment buildings. 
</P>
<P>
	Five people were slightly injured, authorities said.  
</P>
<P>
	Some residents of the Devonshire assisted living center were

	The twister also overturned cars and a tractor-trailer rig, and  
knocked down trees and utility poles, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Weather Service estimated it was a category 2  
tornado with wind of about 120 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Another tornado about two hours earlier damaged a barn and  
snapped utility poles in nearby Chesapeake, said fire department 
Capt. Steve Johnson. No one was injured, he said.

<HEADLINE> `Widows Win' Theory Meets Challenge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In the history of special elections for House  
seats, ``widows win'' is a familiar refrain. They usually do, 
regardless of political party. 
</P>
<P>
	Most recently, Republican Rep. Jo Ann Emerson of Missouri won a  
special election in 1996 to succeed her late husband. So, too, GOP 
Rep. Mary Bono and Democratic Rep. Lois Capps, both in California, 
and both in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	So ordinarily Democrats might have been delighted when Marta  
Macias Brown announced she would attempt to succeed her husband, 
Rep. George Brown of California, who died in July. ``Who better to 
replace him than the person who worked side by side with him over 
the last 19 years?'' the 54-year-old Brown said as she announced 
her candidacy for the Sept. 21 balloting in the area around San 
Bernardino. 
</P>
<P>
	But Mrs. Brown immediately encountered political turbulence that  
other widows don't have to contend with. 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, say  
Mrs. Brown appealed to Democratic Leader Richard Gephardt several 
weeks ago to help clear the field for her. He declined. 
</P>
<P>
	Other Democratic contenders are in the race, including a veteran  
state lawmaker, Sen. Joe Baca. He has a solid political base in the 
district, and bowed to the wishes of party officials two years ago 
who asked him not to mount a primary challenge to Brown. 
</P>
<P>
	In declaring his candidacy, he sought to position himself as  
Brown's heir. ``In the Legislature, I have tried to live what 
Congressman Brown believed,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	--------	 
</P>
<P>
	Ordinarily, the potential for a primary might be giving  
Democrats a bad case of heartburn. 
</P>
<P>
	But Republicans have had recruiting problems of a different sort  
in the district. To their unhappiness, state Sen. Jim Brulte 
recently declined to make the race. Ditto Linda Wilde, who narrowly 
lost to Brown in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	That left Elia Pirozzi, who drew only 40 percent of the vote  
against Brown in 1998, among others. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the Democrats' (seat) to lose,'' says Jill Schroeder,  
spokeswoman for the GOP. And recruiting disappointments aside, on 
voting patterns alone, she's correct. Brown was elected several 
times, President Clinton won the district in 1996 and Sen. Barbara 
Boxer and Gov. Gray Davis both ran well there in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The special House election will be held Sept. 21. If no  
candidate gains a majority, the top vote getter in each party will 
run in a general election in November. 
</P>
<P>
	--------	 

</P>
<P>
	Republicans have suffered one other recent high profile setback  
in their efforts to fortify their narrow majority in the House, 
which now stands at 222, to 211 Democrats, one independent and the 
vacant Brown seat. 
</P>
<P>
	In Michigan, Secretary of State Candice Miller decided not to  
challenge House Democratic Whip David Bonior. Her decision 
surprised GOP campaign strategists who had boasted to reporters 
that Bonior was target No. 1 in 2000, and touted Miller's candidacy 
on their Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	In Montana, Republican Rep. Rick Hill's decision to retire after  
two terms because of health concerns creates an open seat the GOP 
had not expected to have to defend. Nancy Keenan, state 
superintendent of public instruction, is seeking the Democratic 
nomination. The GOP is hoping former Lt. Gov. Dennis Rehberg will 
make the race. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other side of the ledger, strategists in both sides  
expect Republican Rep. Rick Lazio of New York to seek re-election, 
meaning his seat will be safe for the GOP. Lazio had been looking 
to run for the Senate, but those plans are on hold. 
</P>
<P>
	--------	 

</P>
<P>
	Hill's departure brings the number of House retirements thus far  
to 19, 13 of them Republicans and only six Democrats. Most of those 
seats should be easily held by the party that currently occupies 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	But the tiny number of competitive Democratic open seats thus  
far -- only two or three -- means the GOP has few opportunities to 
offset any losses suffered by their own incumbents next year. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, 31 Democrats retired voluntarily and only 22  
Republicans, and the GOP was able to make up for some of its 
incumbent defeats by grabbing seats previously held by Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, retirements split evenly, 17 for each party. Democrats  
won 18 of them en route to whittling away the GOP majority.

<HEADLINE> 'Pilots' Singer Sentenced for Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Stone Temple Pilots singer Scott Weiland has  
been sentenced to nearly a year in jail for violating probation a 
third time in a heroin case. 
</P>
<P>
	Weiland, 31, has been jailed since Aug. 13 after admitting the  
violation. In July, he was treated at a Southern California 
hospital for a heroin overdose. 
</P>
<P>
	In court Friday, representatives of two drug rehabilitation  
groups urged Superior Court Judge Larry Fidler to not give Weiland 
jail time. 
</P>
<P>
	``Relapse was part of recovery,'' defense lawyer Michael Nasatir  
told Fidler. ``I urge you not to totally treat this problem as a 
criminal one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Filder said Weiland is ``killing himself'' and said he ``has  
to be punished. And he will continue to be treated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Weiland, clad in an orange jail jumpsuit, sat quietly during the  
sentencing. The singer's legal troubles began in 1995 when he was 
arrested for possession of cocaine and heroin.

<HEADLINE> Ann-Margret Plays Victimized Grandma </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- For those of a certain age, it may  
be hard to imagine Ann-Margret playing a dowdy grandmother involved 
in a small-town serial killing. 
</P>
<P>
	Well, those people need to brace themselves.  
</P>
<P>
	The 1960s movie sex kitten is playing her own age -- 58 -- as  
Lorraine Petrovich, who watches too much TV, lives with an abusive 
38-year-old man and winds up convicted as an accessory to the 
murders for which the boyfriend takes the rap. 
</P>
<P>
	``Happy Face Murders,'' which appears on Showtime Sept. 5 at 8  
p.m. EDT, is based on a real-life case involving an Oregon woman, 
Laverne Pavlinac. Despite the title, there's nothing lighthearted 
about the movie; ``Happy Face'' refers to the symbols used by the 
murderer. 
</P>
<P>
	Dowdy, aged or evil, Ann-Margret isn't afraid to take roles that  
are counter to her attractive image. Like Bette Davis, Ann-Margret 
believes it's the role that counts, not how she looks. 
</P>
<P>
	Lorraine's cluttered bungalow in the film looks nothing like the  
home that Ann-Margret shares with her husband and personal manager, 
former actor Roger Smith. It was once the home of Humphrey Bogart, 
Lauren Bacall and their two children. (The isolation suited Bogart, 
but his wife forced a move because the children had no neighbors 
with whom to play.) 
</P>
<P>
	The house, approached by a winding road, sits on a plateau above  
Beverly Hills. The gardens are ablaze with summer blossoms, and the 
living room is equally colorful: a huge painting of flowers over 
the hand-carved wooden fireplace; impressionist-style landscapes on 
other walls; palms, ficus trees, lilies and violets; a large bay 
with grand piano and crystal chandelier, and outside the windows, 
jacaranda trees in full purple blossom. 
</P>
<P>
	Adjacent to the living room is an office with floor to ceiling  
photos of Ann-Margret in film roles and on magazine covers. Smith 
was working at the computer, for which he had the keyboard adjusted 
to produce a clacking noise. 
</P>
<P>
	``Roger worked so long on a typewriter that he missed its  
sound,'' she explains. 
</P>
<P>
	For many years he has been afflicted with myasthenia gravis, a  
nerve disease characterized by weakness and quick fatigue of 
muscles, especially of the face and neck. Smith has good days and 
bad days; this is one of his good days. 
</P>
<P>
	He shows little sign of the disease, looking as handsome as when  
he starred on TV in ``Mr. Roberts'' and ``77 Sunset Strip.'' He 
gave up acting after marrying Ann-Margret in 1967, and he is 
credited with shrewd handling of her long career. She is ever 
vigilant of his condition; if there's a string of bad days, she 
will decline work to be with him. 
</P>
<P>
	Sitting in her tasteful home, Ann-Margret looks wildly removed  
from the gray-haired grandmother of her TV movie. Appearing svelte 
and glamorous as always, she was dressed in black, low-cut lounging 
pajamas with a silk coat in a bright floral print that seemed to 
match the decor of her living room. 
</P>
<P>
	She recently had her debut as a lecturer, touring Calgary and  
Edmonton, Canada. She shows clips from her movies and reminisces 
about her life in the studios. Of course, everyone wants to know 
what it was like working with Elvis. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had never done anything like that,'' she said of the  
lecturing. ``For the first 20 minutes, my voice was shaking. When 
the response came, I started relaxing. In the last 15 minutes, when 
I sat down with a moderator, I said, 'You guys! I'm so relaxed I'm 
ready to do a somersault.''' 
</P>
<P>
	But she doesn't plan to put her musical act together and take it  
on the road anymore. Her last tour was almost five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was too hard,'' she said. ``We had like 35 people. We  
brought carpenters -- the world with us. Every night in a different 
place -- and just putting up the sound took a few hours. 
</P>
<P>
	``I remember playing one night in Indiana, then arriving at 3 in  
the afternoon in Buffalo, where it was already dark and snowing 
like mad. I don't know how we got the sound together, but at 8 
o'clock we were ready and had a great time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ann-Margret has had a remarkably varied career. Born Ann-Margret  
Olsson in Sweden, she arrived in Illinois at 5 and at 15 had scored 
a hit on TV's ``Ted Mack's Amateur Hour.'' She quit Midwestern 
University after a year to sing with traveling bands. In 1961, she 
made her film debut as Bette Davis' daughter in ``Pocketful of 
Miracles,'' Frank Capra's last feature. 
</P>
<P>
	After a successful run in movies as a sex symbol and musical  
star, she surprised everyone with her dramatics in Mike Nichols' 
``Carnal Knowledge,'' for which she received an Academy Award 
nomination. She also was an Oscar nominee for the rock opera 
``Tommy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She has continued a busy career, both in TV movies and  
theatrical features. This fall, she'll be seen in ``The Last 
Producer'' with Burt Reynolds and Oliver Stone's ``Any Given 
Sunday,'' in which she co-stars with Al Pacino.

<HEADLINE> Who Deserves Credit for Prosperity? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Bill Clinton? George Bush? Alan Greenspan?  
Congress? Just who should get the credit for America's good times? 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats and Republicans, looking ahead to next year's  
presidential and congressional elections, are already trying to 
convince voters that their party did the most to bring about the 
current prosperity. 
</P>
<P>
	When economists instead of politicians are asked to supply an  
answer, they generally give the most credit to Greenspan and his 
colleagues at the Federal Reserve, for what they see as sure-footed 
handling of monetary policy. 
</P>
<P>
	But they also say President Clinton and former President George  
Bush deserve a share of praise, as do members of Congress. Congress 
was willing to support a string of budget pacts that, starting in 
1990, first gained control of the soaring federal deficits and 
then, last year, pushed the budget into surplus. 
</P>
<P>
	The benefit from reducing government's borrowing demands comes  
in lower interest rates, which helps interest-sensitive sectors of 
the economy like autos and home construction. And just as 
importantly, lower rates help businesses: It costs them less to 
invest in new factories and equipment and enhance productivity. 
</P>
<P>
	Rising productivity, the amount of output per hour of work, is  
crucial to rising living standards because it allows businesses to 
pay their workers more without raising prices and setting off 
inflationary pressures. 
</P>
<P>
	Productivity increased by 2.2 percent last year, more than  
double the weak 1 percent average gains of the previous two 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
	While economists dispute whether this pickup will be  
long-lasting, no less an authority than Federal Reserve Chairman 
Alan Greenspan believes the pickup in productivity is real -- and 
even undercounted by government statistics. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, the Federal Reserve has been willing to allow the  
unemployment rate to fall far below levels that once would have 
caused the central bank to worry about rising wage demands 
triggering higher inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed did begin nudging rates higher on June 30 in an effort  
to slow the economy a bit. But the Fed's action came only after the 
jobless rate had dipped to a three-decade low of 4.2 percent. 
That's far below the 6 percent level formerly considered the 
threshold when tight labor markets start pushing inflation higher. 
</P>
<P>
	So far the Fed's decision to let good times roll has not caused  
inflation problems. In fact, consumer prices last year rose by just 
1.6 percent, the best showing in 11 years. Despite a big rebound in 
energy costs, prices this year are increasing by just over 2 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The global currency crisis, depressing world demand for the past  
two years, also has lowered prices in the United States for oil, 
cars and other imports. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists who acknowledge a pickup in productivity are  
marveling at the nation's fortunate combination of low inflation 
and low unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
	``Government policy has played a role in the economy's stellar  
performance,'' says Mark Zandi, economist at Regional Financial 
Associates in West Chester, Pa., ``but we have also benefited from 
a good dose of just plain luck.''

<HEADLINE> New Mexico Transfers 109 Prisoners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- Four days after a guard was stabbed to  
death during an uprising at a privately run prison, 109 inmates 
were shifted to a high-security state prison in Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	Such a move had been threatened previously by Gov. Gary Johnson  
after other recent violence at three private prisons in the state. 
</P>
<P>
	The new Wallens Ridge Correctional Facility, a state prison in  
Big Stone Gap, Va., was chosen because it is designed to hold the 
most dangerous of inmates. 
</P>
<P>
	``Given the history and destructive nature of these inmates, I  
think it's important to send them a message that if you mess with 
the bull, you're going to get the horns,'' said Rob Perry, New 
Mexico's corrections secretary. 
</P>
<P>
	The inmates were transferred Friday from the medium-security  
Guadalupe County Correctional Facility, where prisoners angry about 
a lockdown took over common living areas for three hours Tuesday 
before authorities regained control. A guard was fatally stabbed 
and an inmate was wounded in a stabbing. 
</P>
<P>
	The prisoners believed to have taken part in killing the guard  
were sent to a maximum-security area of a state prison in New 
Mexico. Others believed to have taken part in the uprising were 
transferred to Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	The Guadalupe County prison is operated by Florida-based  
Wackenhut Corrections Corp. Perry said the transfer also was a 
warning to Wackenhut to improve its management. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's important to send a message to all of the parties  
involved,'' he said. ``The state of New Mexico's not going to 
tolerate prison violence, homicide and riots, and this is the 
response.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Four inmates and a guard have died in Wackenhut-run prisons in  
New Mexico in the past nine months. In addition, two guards were 
injured in a disturbance Aug. 17 at a prison run by Corrections 
Corporation of America. 
</P>
<P>
	Wackenhut spokesman Pat Cannan said company officials are  
``concentrating our efforts to bringing the situation under 
control'' at their two New Mexico prisons. 
</P>
<P>
	The four inmate killings are more than all of New Mexico's  
state-run prisons have had in any single year since 1985. The 
killing of the guard was the first in New Mexico since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	New Mexico houses about a third of its nearly 5,200 male inmates  
at privately operated prisons. 
</P>
<P>
	The state is paying Virginia $64 a day to house each of the  
transferred inmates.

<HEADLINE> Penn State Top Athletic Department </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Penn State not only is one of the top football  
programs in the country, it also has one of the best athletic 
departments, according to a survey in this week's The Sporting 
News. 
</P>
<P>
	In a survey of the 112 U.S. colleges and universities that  
participate in both NCAA Division I football and men's basketball, 
Penn State received ``A'' grades in three of the four categories, 
including ``Do We Win?'', ``Do We Graduate?'', ``Do We Rock?'', and 
Do We Play Fair?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The rest of the top ten consisted of North Carolina, Notre Dame,  
Stanford, Florida, Duke, Purdue, Virginia, Nebraska and Michigan 
State. 
</P>
<P>
	In the second ten were Iowa, Wisconsin, Michigan, Kentucky,  
Syracuse, UCLA, Northwestern, Illinois, Ohio State and Washington. 
Rounding out the top 25 were Indiana, Florida State, Arizona, 
Georgia Tech and Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
	The Big Ten led with 10 schools in the top 25, followed by the  
ACC with five. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do We Win?'' awards points for victories, regular-season  
conference championships, conference tournament championships, rank 
in The Sporting News poll, and performance in bowl games and the 
NCAA basketball tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do We Graduate?'' uses the ``freshman-cohort'' graduation rate  
for both sports as the most recent measure of academic achievement 
for the four classes which entered school in the 1989-92 period, 
allowing six years for a degree. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Do We Rock?'' category measures fan support, attendance,  
merchandise sold, size of athletic budget, number of teams, and 
points awarded in the annual Sears Directors' Cup competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, ``Do We Play Fair?'' uses Title IX compliance, the  
``freshman-cohort'' graduation rate for all student-athletes, and 
graduation rate for those using all their athletic eligibility at 
one school. It also takes into account NCAA probation and the 
addition or subtraction of teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Penn State received ``A's'' in every category, except ``Do We  
Win?'', which gave the Nittany Lions an ``A-minus'' for the 
basketball team's failure to make a postseason tournament. Penn 
State's overall grade average was 3.92. 
</P>
<P>
	The first-time survey is expected to help college-bound  
athletes, university recruiters, and high school coaching staffs 
and guidance counselors. 
</P>
<P>
	The grading process is similar to that generally used by  
colleges, with 4.0 for A, 3.0 for B, and so forth. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey appears in the Sept. 13 issue of The Sporting News.

<HEADLINE> For NFL Players It's Feel the Pain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	He keeps orthopedists busy around the clock. He goes for surgery  
about as often as some people go to the store for socks. An entire 
health maintenance organization could be built around his aching 
bones. 
</P>
<P>
	For Mark Schlereth, a left guard for the Super Bowl champion  
Denver Broncos, the pain never goes away. 
</P>
<P>
	``For seven seconds, during each play, I'm able to forget about  
it and put it on the back burner,'' he said. ``As soon as the play 
ends, I start limping back to the huddle in pain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And he's not alone. In the NFL, just about every player is  
hurting. At practice, during games, after games. And the injuries 
don't have to be as agonizing as shredded ligaments or ripped 
hamstrings. The body just plain hurts. Everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
	Take Schlereth. He's 33 and has had 25 operations, with his  
knees taking the brunt of it. He's had his gall bladder removed and 
back surgery for herniated discs. He's had a neurological condition 
that left him falling over himself. He once played a Monday night 
game hours after passing a kidney stone. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said when I started it would be 20 surgeries or 10 years,''  
he said. ``Now it's 25 surgeries and 11 years, and I'm still 
going.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schlereth, the league's poster boy for mangled limbs and joints,  
has a medical history like no other. And his NFL colleagues might 
be the only ones who fully understand his grinding ordeal. 
</P>
<P>
	This, after all, is a sport in which sculpted, 300-pound bodies  
encased in high-tech armor crash into each other at blinding 
speeds. And while a graphic injury -- Darryl Stingley's paralysis, 
Joe Theismann's grotesquely broken leg -- surely underscores the 
perils of the game, the daily routine of hitting and healing often 
is taken for granted. 
</P>
<P>
	For fans bundled in parkas in a stadium's upper deck or plunked  
in front of a TV and fortified with chips, cola and beer, the 
unrelenting demands of pro football can be lost. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's unexplainable,'' Miami Dolphins running back Bernie  
Parmalee said. ``If you don't actually feel it, it's something you 
can't explain. It's tough. That's part of the business the fans 
don't see. It looks like it's not much. They don't see all the 
bumps and bruises you've got to fight through.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago Bears linebacker Rico McDonald had reconstructive knee  
surgery in 1993. He can't expect fans to comprehend the combat on 
the field. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll look at a basketball game and think, `That looks easy,'  
'' he said. ``Then I'll go out to my backyard and shoot some hoops. 
It's not their fault. If you've never done it, there's no real way 
you can feel it. It takes a person who's done this to truly 
understand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New Orleans coach Mike Ditka, once the snarling symbol of  
football grit, points to bigger and faster players today and 
explains the laws of the game as a matter of basic physics. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess it's mass and velocity,'' he said. ``When you get  
something moving at a certain speed, something has got to give -- 
the thing you're hitting or yourself. And that's basically what 
football's all about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fan watching at home may be removed from the violence on the  
field, but the physical dimension of the game is still more 
palpable than ever on television. 
</P>
<P>
	Ed Goren, executive producer at Fox Sports, said the enhanced  
use of sideline mikes the past five years provides a more natural 
sound replay, allowing viewers to ``hear the hit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Anybody who hasn't been on the sideline can't get a sense of  
the force of the hit or the size of the players,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL Players Association does not catalogue injuries  
accumulated during a season. But consider a typical injury report 
from 1998: week eight -- smack in the middle of the season -- with 12 
games scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
	The list reads like an account from a train wreck, with body  
parts scattered everywhere. In all, 140 players are cited for 27 
ailments. The leading injury was to the knee (33 players), followed 
by the ankle (21) and shoulder and groin (10 each). 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody is dinged somewhere,'' Dolphins offensive guard Mark  
Dixon said. ``You find a way to deal with it. The level this game 
is played at, you have injuries. There's no way around it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bears trainer Tim Bream thinks a high threshold of pain is  
expected from football players because this is ``such a Spartan 
sport.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Every sport is punishing in some way just because of the  
demands on the different body parts,'' he said. ``I think from 
talking to different athletic trainers and different physicians 
that ice hockey is similar because of the amount of games they have 
and the contact.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bubba Tyer has seen a lot of blood in his 23 years as trainer of  
the Redskins. He remembers when star offensive lineman Russ Grim, 
now an assistant coach with Washington, nearly lost his eye after 
being poked and was rushed to the hospital. He returned to the 
stadium with stitches in his eyelid. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was mad at the ambulance driver for taking her time because  
he wanted to get back in the game,'' Tyer said. 
</P>
<P>
	For many players, the best way to deal with the physical  
hardship is simple -- forget it: 
</P>
<P>
	--San Diego cornerback Dwayne Harper missed almost a year because  
of neck surgery. ``I'm not going to worry about what happened last 
year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--San Francisco defensive tackle Bryant Young is coming back  
after a severely broken leg. ``I think it's healthy to get it off 
your mind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Atlanta running back Bob Christian had knee surgery after last  
season. ``I don't think about it that much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But sometimes the pain is unmistakable, and the course of action  
indisputable: It's quittin' time. 
</P>
<P>
	Green Bay wide receiver Robert Brooks retired during training  
camp. His knees, back and hamstrings were a mess, and he worried 
about all the medication. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm 29 years old,'' he said. ``And after practice, I feel like  
I'm 50.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland linebacker Chris Spielman quit two weeks before the  
season opener after a blindside hit left him numb. He had already 
missed a season and was coming off surgery to fuse neck vertebrae. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're all football warriors,'' he said. ``And being that, you  
have to accept your mortality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, few would trade what they have. Others outside football  
endure just as much pain, but without the celebrity, support and 
compensation. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the greatest job in the world,'' Dixon said. ``You're  
getting paid good money and it's something you always wanted to do, 
so you don't even think about tomorrow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All the punishment may exact a price down the road. But Ditka,  
for one, doesn't regret it for a moment. For him, the pain is 
merely an occupational hazard. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sure it takes a toll on the body,'' he said. ``So does sky  
diving. If the parachute doesn't open you're in trouble.''

<HEADLINE> Baptists to Members: Pray for Jews </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT WORTH (AP) -- Southern Baptists are asking members to pray  
that Jews will convert to Christianity this month during Rosh 
Hashanah, the Jewish new year, and Yom Kippur, the Jewish Day of 
Atonement. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosh Hashanah is next Saturday and Yom Kippur on Sept. 20, with  
both celebrations beginning at sundown the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	A ``prayer guide'' published and distributed by the Southern  
Baptist International Mission Board in Richmond, Va., explains the 
Jewish high holy days, gives sketches of Jewish people in different 
parts of the world and offers suggestions on how to pray for Jewish 
people. 
</P>
<P>
	The guide urges Baptists to ``to pray for Jewish individuals you  
know by name.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some Jewish leaders described the action as arrogant and  
offensive. 
</P>
<P>
	``Baptists have a right to believe what they believe,'' said  
Mark Briskman, Southwest regional director for the Anti-Defamation 
League of B'nai B'rith. ``But we find this offensive. It shows an 
element of arrogance because they are specifically targeting Jews 
during this holy season.''

<HEADLINE> Holtz Returns to the Sidelines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- The last time Lou Holtz coached a game at  
Carter-Finley Stadium, he was on the other side of the field, 
taking on a team wearing a deeper shade of red than the Wolfpack. 
</P>
<P>
	A Holtz-led North Carolina State team beat South Carolina 28-21  
in his final home game as coach in November 1975 before a one-year 
stint in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	Four teams, 24 years, one national championship, 170 college  
wins and a two-year commentating career later, Holtz returned 
Saturday as the Gamecocks' coach, opening the season at N.C. State. 
</P>
<P>
	``We love him. We're glad he's here,'' said Gamecock fan Dick  
Childress of Columbia, S.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Childress and other fans, many wearing the garnet and black of  
USC, huddled under cover near the concession stands during halftime 
to keep dry. Heavy rain and winds swept across the field from 
Tropical Storm Dennis. 
</P>
<P>
	``We might not win a lot of games this year,'' Childress said.  
``He can bring more character and class and give us a good 
reputation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holtz unexpectedly left Notre Dame in 1996 after 11 years in  
which he led the Irish to the 1988 national championship and a 
100-30-1 record. After leaving Notre Dame, he was a college 
football commentator on CBS, but the desire to coach never went 
away. 
</P>
<P>
	In December, South Carolina named Holtz its new coach after  
firing Brad Scott, who led the Gamecocks to a 1-10 record, the 
school's worst in 106 years. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, he paced the sidelines and pointed at officials as  
they called penalties against South Carolina -- as if he had never 
left. 
</P>
<P>
	Gamecocks fans hope Holtz will be able to make the team  
successful quickly, but most admit it will take some time. 
</P>
<P>
	``This year will be an improvement just because the players will  
be coached better,'' South Carolina alumnus Matt Cobb said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The biggest thing is getting recruits we haven't been able to  
get,'' added Smithfield, N.C., resident Clint Barrish, attending 
the game with South Carolina fans. 
</P>
<P>
	Holtz said since joining the Gamecocks, his goals are to recruit  
good players from South Carolina, beat a fellow Southeastern 
Conference team like Florida, Tennessee or Georgia soon and take 
the team to its first major bowl game. 
</P>
<P>
	He accomplished the first goal by signing South Carolina's ``Mr.  
Football,'' tailback Derek Watson. 
</P>
<P>
	Holtz's coaching career goes back to 1969 when he started at  
William &AMP; Mary, and then went to N.C. State, the New York Jets for 
one season, Arkansas, Minnesota and Notre Dame. At Minnesota, he 
also took over a 1-10 team after the 1983 season. 
</P>
<P>
	His first team at N.C. State, the 1972 squad, amassed a  
school-record 4,758 yards of total offense and scored 409 points. 
He took the Wolfpack to four straight bowl games, and his four 
teams were 20-1-1 at home and 10-1 in night games.

<HEADLINE>  Angry French Farmers Protest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MARSEILLE, France (AP) -- Hundreds of angry farmers protesting  
American trade muscle and economic globalization bombarded riot 
police with apples on Saturday in this Mediterranean port city, the 
latest demonstration in two weeks of protests. 
</P>
<P>
	Security forces lobbed tear gas to stop the volley of apples  
thrown by 500 fruit and vegetable farmers armed with shopping carts 
from the Carrefour grocery store chain. 
</P>
<P>
	In a simultaneous protest, up to 200 protesting farmers, with  
cows, geese, pigs and a horses in tow, gathered in the Normandy 
town of Deauville, where the yearly American Film Festival was 
underway. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Americans came to help us 50 years ago,'' said Hilaire  
Taillecours, 62, from the Plateau du Neubourg in Normandy. ``But 
that doesn't mean they can tell us what to eat and how to film.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Taillecours raises cows and grows wheat and red beats on his  
125-acre farm. 
</P>
<P>
	His complaint reflected the expanding nature of the protest,  
which initially protested U.S. sanctions on a slew of products 
ranging from Roquefort cheese to foie gras. It has since expanded 
to include everything that symbolizes American ``hegemony'' in 
trade and agriculture, and globalization. 
</P>
<P>
	The protesters are all members of the radical agricultural  
union, the Farmers' Confederation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Globalization is creating absurd economic conflicts,'' the  
union said in an earlier statement. The aim of their protests is to 
``allow farmers and others to feed themselves as they think best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The farmers initially targeted McDonald's France as a symbol of  
globalization, landing union leader Jose Bove and four others in 
jail on Aug. 19 after a McDonald's construction site in the 
southern town of Millau was vandalized. 
</P>
<P>
	The imprisoned sheep farmer has quickly become a cause celebre  
of the movement, with offers from around France, and even from 
American farm groups, to pay his $17,000. McDonald's France dropped 
its damages claim against Bove, who refused a court offer to free 
him from jail last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Bove's lawyer, Francois Roux, said Friday that his client might  
go free by Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers Ponder Crop Insurance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Farming is a risky business in a stormy area  
of the Great Plains known as Tornado Alley. ``We know there's going 
to be a disaster,'' said Jerry McReynolds, who farms near Woodston, 
Kan. ``We just don't know what kind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McReynolds, who lost some of his wheat to hail this year, tries  
to protect his investment by purchasing federally subsidized crop 
insurance, but the program is so inadequate that many of his 
neighbors don't even bother to buy it, he said. The insurance only 
covers half the value of his wheat crop. 
</P>
<P>
	``What's available at the present time is so cost-ineffective,  
it's a joke,'' McReynolds said. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress is trying to do something about the problem. With the  
farm economy crippled by recession, lawmakers are seeking ways to 
weave a new safety net for growers without scrapping the 1996 farm 
law that phased out the old Depression-era price support system. 
Crop insurance is considered a crucial part of the safety net. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers want to substantially lower premiums by doubling the  
insurance program's cost to taxpayers to about $3 billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
	The government currently pays 13 percent to 57 percent of the  
premium, with farmers picking up the rest. Under a bill approved by 
the House Agriculture Committee last month, the government subsidy 
would range from 31 percent to 67 percent, depending on the level 
of coverage. The legislation also boosts coverage for farmers who 
suffered one or two major crop losses in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar bills that have been introduced in the Senate. A rival  
plan is being pushed by the chairman of the Senate Agriculture 
Committee, Sen. Dick Lugar, R-Ind. Rather than reduce premiums, 
Lugar wants to give direct payments to growers to spend as they 
choose. 
</P>
<P>
	There's still a question of whether farmers will buy the  
insurance if they think Congress will provide them with disaster 
aid each year. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress gave farmers $6 billion in 1998 to compensate for  
weather-related crop failures and low commodity prices and is 
considering even more assistance this year. The Senate approved a 
$7.4 billion aid package in August, and the Clinton administration 
is working on a request for more than that. 
</P>
<P>
	``The political process has been pretty good at providing  
disaster aid -- if you knew your loss was going to be covered, would 
you buy insurance on your house, for example?'' said Kansas State 
University agriculture professor Art Barnaby. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnaby guesses that lawmakers might hold off on reforming crop  
insurance till next spring. 
</P>
<P>
	Passage of this year's disaster aid is the top priority of Rep.  
Jo Ann Emerson, a Missouri Republican who serves on the House 
Appropriations subcommittee that handles farm spending. While new 
ideas are critical, she said, they won't help producers struggling 
with this year's low prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think anyone believes crop insurance is a panacea for  
solving the farm crisis,'' Emerson said. ``Anything we do with 
regard to crop insurance won't apply to the crisis farmers are 
facing this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McReynolds, the Kansas farmer, says the money Congress spends on  
disaster aid would be better spent on new risk-management programs 
for farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Disaster programs are not the best way to handle it, no. I  
think we need a more stable program than that. Crop insurance is a 
way to go,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics say the current crop insurance program doesn't work  
where disasters have struck several years in a row because policies 
are based on past crop yields. If yields drop, so does the 
available coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	And if a producer, spurred by flexibility in the 1996 law,  
plants a completely new crop, insurers aren't willing to cover it 
until a few years later, when it is established. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers are trying to address those problems by creating an  
average production history credit program for startup farmers or 
those who have added land or rotated crops. It adjusts the history 
for producers who have suffered calamities.

<HEADLINE> Sen. Harkin Decides To Endorse Gore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- U.S. Sen. Tom Harkin has decided to  
endorse Vice President Al Gore's bid for the Democratic 
presidential nomination and will announce his decision Monday, 
senior Democratic officials told The Associated Press Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Harkin has scheduled a series of appearances with Gore on Labor  
Day and will formally endorse him at that time, said the officials, 
who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	``You'll be hearing from Tom about his long history with the  
vice president,'' said one official. 
</P>
<P>
	Harkin and Gore will attend Labor Day events in Des Moines,  
Cedar Rapids and Dubuque, three cities where organized labor has 
the highest profile in the state where precinct caucuses launch the 
presidential nominating season. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore is getting a challenge from former New Jersey Sen. Bill  
Bradley for the nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	While Bradley's challenge is significant, Harkin decision is  
still one more example of the difficulty Bradley faces in trying to 
pry major pieces of the Democratic establishment away from a 
sitting vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	Harkin sought the Democratic nomination himself in 1992, but  
quickly faded. After dropping, he quickly endorsed then-candidate 
Bill Clinton and developed close ties to the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	That was expanded to include Gore, and the two have been close  
personally and politically. 
</P>
<P>
	The endorsement is good new for Gore for a couple of other  
reasons. Harkin is one of the most successful politicians in either 
party in Iowa. He first won election to Congress in 1974, and 
served for 10 years before knocking off a sitting Republican U.S. 
Senator.

<HEADLINE> ESPN Turns Twenty Years Old </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- It all began with a public relations executive  
eager to find a way to televise Hartford Whalers hockey games 
throughout Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
	ESPN has long surpassed its humble origins, growing into a  
corporate power with one radio and four TV networks, a magazine, 
Web site and chain of restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
	Along the way, it has dramatically influenced how a generation  
views, and plays, the games -- erasing whatever line may have 
divided sports and entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
	ESPN is wherever sports fans congregate. Commuters at Grand  
Central Terminal gaze at ``SportsCenter'' as their shoes are 
shined. Pittsburgh Pirates cluster around a clubhouse set to watch 
highlights of a game they just played. Rap star Puff Daddy eyes 
ESPN in the lounge near his Manhattan studio. 
</P>
<P>
	For millions of viewers weaned on videotaped touchdowns and slam  
dunks, home runs and holes-in-one, life without ESPN is 
inconceivable. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet the network was only a sports fan's fantasy until Sept. 7,  
1979 -- 20 years ago this week. 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	William Rasmussen easily recalls the drive when he conceived  
ESPN's blueprint. It was Aug. 16, 1978. 
</P>
<P>
	A publicist for the former Whalers, he had hoped to harness the  
emerging cable TV technology to telecast their games. Before that 
could happen, Rasmussen and most everyone associated with the team 
were fired after a dismal 1977-78 season. He kept his TV contacts, 
though, and acquired a satellite transponder that enabled him to 
start a cable network. 
</P>
<P>
	But how? Rasmussen pondered the question that August afternoon  
as he drove from a Hartford suburb. His son suggested showing tapes 
of football games. By the time they reached the Jersey shore, 
Rasmussen had decided to try an all-sports network, ask the NCAA 
for the rights to televise college games and produce a prototype 
for a daily highlights show that would become ``SportsCenter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``When you have kids to feed and all of a sudden your job is  
gone, you think of things,'' he explains. 
</P>
<P>
	Rasmussen wanted the name Sports Programming Network, but that  
was already claimed. So he added ``E'' for Entertainment. In 1984, 
after he was gone, it became simply ESPN -- the letters no longer 
signifying words. 
</P>
<P>
	Like CNN for news and MTV for music, the idea seems obvious in  
retrospect. Cable was still a toddler then, and television was 
dominated by ABC, CBS and NBC. They aired some sports, but for a 
daily fix, viewers had to settle for brief segments during the 
local news. 
</P>
<P>
	``You didn't get highlights of every game. You didn't get  
previews of series. You picked up the paper and you opened it up 
and you looked to see how Rod Carew did,'' says Tony Gwynn, an 
outfielder for the San Diego Padres. ``Now, you come home from the 
park and turn on ESPN. You find out right away what's going on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	ESPN began by reporting on Chris Evert Lloyd's U.S. Open tennis  
victory over Billie Jean King. Its first live event followed: 1979 
Professional Slo-Pitch Softball World Series with the Milwaukee 
Schlitzes challenging the Kentucky Bourbons. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of baseball and basketball, early ESPN aired darts and  
billiards. Several milestones helped it gain its footing: first 
live coverage of the NCAA basketball tournament, 1980; first live 
college football, 1984; first NFL football, 1987 -- another first, 
when ESPN began making money. 
</P>
<P>
	(Analysts estimated ESPN and its spinoff, ESPN2, made $1.6  
billion last year.) 
</P>
<P>
	``It has only fed the fervor of the football enthusiast, the  
golf enthusiast, you name it,'' says golfer Hale Irwin. ``You go to 
people's homes now and they might have three or four television 
sets on the wall. It has created a whole different home 
entertainment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pick a trend in sports over the past two decades, and it's  
likely ESPN played a part: the booming popularity of the NCAA's 
March madness, the stratosphere of athletes' salaries, the 
explosion in fees paid to leagues for broadcast rights. 
</P>
<P>
	``ESPN has been great for college basketball,'' says Fresno  
State coach Jerry Tarkanian. ``The great popularity of the game is 
due to ESPN and (commentator) Dick Vitale.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Butch Davis, a football coach at the University of Miami, says  
ESPN has similarly helped his sport -- maybe too much. Sometimes, he 
complains, fans are so seduced by all the games on TV that they 
don't bother driving to the Orange Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	ESPN has ``brought another dimension to the intensity of the  
game: the quality of the exposure,'' says Penn State football coach 
Joe Paterno. ``It's not one or two days, it's ongoing. It's a big 
happening when they come on campus. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's put a lot of pressure on coaches and kids,'' he adds.  
``There's a little more than maybe some kids can handle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Berman cannot recall which nickname he announced first on  
``SportsCenter'': Frank Tanana ``Daiquiri''? John Mayberry ``RFD''? 
Hundreds followed, but it was on a baseball field that he realized 
just how deeply his comic signature had registered. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1982, Berman hovered near the batting cage, watching the  
Kansas City Royals prepare for a pivotal late-season game with the 
California Angels, when third base star George Brett approached. 
The Royals were concerned, Brett said, that they didn't have as 
many nicknames as other teams. Teammate Willie Wilson voiced the 
same complaint. So did U.L. Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonplussed but proud, Berman wondered: Shouldn't they be more  
worried about the pennant race? 
</P>
<P>
	``SportsCenter'' is ESPN's showcase, airing several times a day.  
From the beginning, comedy was as constant as film clips. Anchors 
Berman, Dan Patrick, the late Tom Mees, Keith Olbermann and others 
have always been quick with a wisecrack, or a snide aside. 
</P>
<P>
	It served as a model for ABC's ``Sports Night,'' a highly  
regarded sitcom entering its second season. The annual Espy Awards 
is the ``SportsCenter'' to the extreme, with athletes like baseball 
slugger Mark McGwire and anchors in tuxedos celebrating what looks 
good on TV. ESPN has effectively expanded the reach of its credo: 
Sports news isn't just news. It's entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
	``They keep it fun,'' says Brian Jordan, an outfielder for the  
Atlanta Braves. ``They're always laughing and enjoying themselves. 
That's what people like to see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	ESPN anchors try to have fun with sports, since that's why fans  
are fans. ``We talk with people,'' Berman says, ``not at them or 
down to them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dick Trickle values his ``SportsCenter'' joke. Patrick  
effectively adopted the NASCAR driver, mentioning where Trickle 
finished every time ESPN reported on a stock car race. It's not 
clear why, except that Trickle's name could guarantee a snicker 
among teen-age viewers. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearing 60, Trickle has heard sophomoric jokes since he was a  
kid. The journeyman driver doesn't mind ESPN's humor, especially 
when he considers what it's done for his career. 
</P>
<P>
	He never has to worry about attracting sponsors, and his fan  
club is nearly as big as circuit star Jeff Gordon's. ESPN, he says, 
``has made me one of the most popular drivers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Phil Mushnick, a columnist for the New York Post, considers ESPN  
humor a marketing strategy. ``It sometimes seems that the hearts 
and minds of the people they want to capture is in an 18- or 
19-year-old male, wearing a Motley Crue T-shirt, probably hung 
over, living in his parents' basement with a half-eaten pizza in a 
box on the floor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He isn't the only one who doesn't appreciate the humor. Last  
winter, the Major League Baseball Players Association asked ESPN 
executives to meet with offended players. 
</P>
<P>
	``They make jokes out of everybody's mistakes,'' says Tony  
Womack, an outfielder for the Arizona Diamondbacks. ``I don't like 
the criticism and the sarcasm from people who have never played at 
this level.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Failed ``SportsCenter'' jokes are easy to wave off. Just ignore  
ESPN's recent ``Which Bear Project,'' a spoof of the Chicago Bears' 
search for a quarterback that spun off the hit film, ``The Blair 
Witch Project.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What is harder to overlook are the legions of ESPN imitators on  
local TV and radio stations who deliver sports with a healthy 
helping of smugness and smarm. 
</P>
<P>
	A recent survey of broadcast journalism students at Syracuse,  
Missouri, Columbia and Ohio universities found that half of the men 
enrolled aspire to be sportscasters. Most list ESPN as the place 
they'd like to work. 
</P>
<P>
	That's one reason why often twice as many women as men apply for  
local TV news jobs, says Chris Tuohey, a broadcast professor at 
Syracuse who explains the frustration of his colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of students do the sports reports on their student  
newscasts in the ESPN style,'' he says. ``They are more interested 
in being funny and using sports lingo than they are in doing local 
feature pieces. They don't understand that there's no market in 
local television news for the ESPN style.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, there's been a backlash among TV news directors against  
this style, says John Quarderer, a vice president at the 
broadcasting research firm of Frank Magid and Associates. They 
figure viewers who want humor and highlights will watch 
``SportsCenter,'' so it's better to fill local sports reports with 
local news. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who try to appropriate the network's style forget that  
humor should come second to information, ESPN's Berman says. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if they're imitating us or if they're just trying  
to be noticed,'' he says. ``It's like a bad sports coat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	A Little League player smacks a long drive toward the left-field  
fence. He stands in the batter's box, twirling his bat, admiring 
his work. When the ball bounces off the fence instead of sailing 
over it, he's caught flat-footed -- and thrown out at second base. 
</P>
<P>
	A witness to the scene, Mushnick knew where he saw that  
posturing before. On TV. On ``SportsCenter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another time, he watched as kids in a pickup football game got  
in only a few plays before they abandoned it to practice the 
end-zone spikes they'd do if they scored a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
	Style over substance -- a pervasive effect that some critics  
blame on years of ``SportsCenter'' clips that emphasize the 
colorful more than the competent. What message gets through if 
taunting gets more attention than teamwork? 
</P>
<P>
	Youngsters see hitters hang back at the plate to admire their  
home runs and hear ``SportsCenter'' anchors note how the star 
wields his ``whipping stick.'' Their coach may say it's important 
to run hard to first base, but TV shows the home-run trot. 
</P>
<P>
	Basketball purists claim the fundamentals are deteriorating;  
shooting is slipping, scoring is down. Some coaches, like Indiana's 
Bob Knight, point to ESPN, suggesting its infatuation with the slam 
dunk has fostered a culture of individual play, not teamwork. 
</P>
<P>
	ESPN's Berman is sensitive to the criticism and suggests ESPN  
may have erred in celebrating excessive displays after dunks or 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	``It does go a little too far, which is why the NFL has put a  
flag on it,'' he concedes. ``After a while, we realized we should 
have a flag on it, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves' Jordan doesn't believe athletes alter their style of  
play to get on ESPN, but he knows many relish the chance to get on 
TV. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm always trying to make something happen so I can see myself  
on `SportsCenter,' as long as it's something good,'' the slugging 
outfielder says. ``If you do something bad, you're definitely going 
to be on there. And those guys can make you look pretty bad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even then, ESPN may be irresistible. A disgruntled Emmitt Smith,  
running back for the Dallas Cowboys, watches ``SportsCenter'' 
twice, sometimes three times, a day. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only time they show the Cowboys is when we do something  
wrong or we get smoked out by a team,'' he grouses. 
</P>
<P>
	But still he tunes in.  
</P>
<P>
	``Oh, yeah,'' he says. ``I'm gonna watch it.''  
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty years. In real life, just out of adolescence. In  
television terms, ESPN is the geeky kid who wouldn't leave his room 
yet emerged as an Internet millionaire. 
</P>
<P>
	Rasmussen couldn't save the Whalers. But, day after day, he's  
reminded of ESPN when he hears the mechanics at a gas station 
talking about Chris Berman or passes by TV monitors in sports 
stadiums. ``You had something to do with that, didn't you, 
Pop-Pop,'' his grandson will say. 
</P>
<P>
	Barry Larkin, a veteran shortstop for the Cincinnati Reds, can  
recall a time before ESPN when he thinks about its influence. 
</P>
<P>
	``Before, there was only a limited amount of time on network  
news devoted to sports,'' he says. ``ESPN was a vehicle that 
allowed more people to watch sports and, in turn, sports became 
more popular. Not just baseball, but all sports.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Larkin looks to his 6-year-old son, DeShane, for confirmation.  
</P>
<P>
	``He wouldn't have known anything about hockey before  
`SportsCenter,''' he says. ``Now, he wants to be a hockey player.''

<P>
	DARLINGTON, S.C. (AP) -- Dale Jarrett won the third-quarter award  
in the Driver of the Year competition, but he couldn't win a 
coveted pit position on the frontstretch for the Southern 500. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the additional time needed to enter and exit the  
backstretch pits under caution at Darlington Raceway, the Winston 
Cup points leader probably has no chance to win the race. Only once 
in 92 Darlington races dating to 1950 has the winner come from the 
backstretch. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just have to try to find a way,'' said Jarrett, who will  
start 36th after failing to make the top 28 -- and get a 
frontstretch pit -- Saturday in second-round qualifying. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure glad they voted on this award before the last two  
weeks,'' Jarrett said, alluding to a 38th-place finish a week ago 
in Bristol, Tenn., and poor qualifying results the last two days at 
Darlington. 
</P>
<P>
	Only Todd Bodine and Stanton Barrett failed to make the Southern  
500 field. Provisional starting positions went to Terry Labonte, 
Michael Waltrip, Steve Park, Rich Bickle, David Green, Robert 
Pressley and Dave Marcis.

	 *FAVORITE NEPHEW: Johnny Bowser, who has high hopes for a $1  
million payoff, displays a fairly decent standup routine. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowser, a maintenance man from Charlotte, N.C., is one of five  
fans whose names were drawn in the Winston No Bull 5 promotion. 
Each is matched with a driver. Both get $1 million should that 
driver win Sunday in the Southern 500. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he had any new friends since word got out that he was a  
possible recipient, Bowser said no. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I found out I had an aunt that's been lost for 41 years,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Like many in the promotion's past, Bowser seriously considered  
being part of a five-way split that would guarantee each fan 
$200,000 should any of five designated drivers win. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I made one thing clear, If I got Mark Martin, I wasn't  
splitting,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin cringed.  
</P>
<P>
	``Now I'm going to feel bad if things don't go our way,'' he  
said. ``But it's really neat when you create a scenario where a fan 
can win a million.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll second that,'' Bowser said.  
</P>
<P>
	Martin said he'll go all out to win the race for him.  
</P>
<P>
	``I appreciate that,'' Bowser said. ``I'd like to retire.''  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *PIT STOPS: The Southern 500 has not been a fun ride for drivers  
of Pontiacs. That brand's losing streak in the oldest NASCAR event 
is 38 races. Buck Baker had Pontiac's only victory in 1960. Pontiac 
is 1-for-49 in the race and 2-for-92 overall on the track. ... 
Chevrolet leads all manufacturers in Southern 500 victories with 
19. Ford is second with 11 wins on Labor Day weekend. ... David 
Pearson's record of six poles in the race should be safe for a long 
time. Among active drivers, only Bill Elliott, Darrell Waltrip and 
Dale Jarrett have as many as two. ... When Johnny Mantz won the 
first Southern 500 in a Plymouth, the other models in the top five 
were two Oldsmobiles, a Cadillac and a Mercury. None of those makes 
is still campaigned. ... The Wood Brothers, who field Fords for 
rookie Elliott Sadler; and Richard Childress, whose Chevys are 
driven by Dale Earnhardt and Mike Skinner, lead active car owners 
with eight Darlington victories -- including those in the spring 
races. ... Although a slew of father and son drivers who became 
NASCAR stars -- including the Pettys, Allisons and Jarretts -- have 
raced in the Southern 500, only Buck Baker and son Buddy have won 
from the same family.

<HEADLINE> 'Seven Year Itch' Actress Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BURBANK , Calif. (AP) -- Marguerite Chapman, who starred in a  
series of World War II movies and later as a secretary in Marilyn 
Monroe's film the ``The Seven Year Itch,'' has died. She was 81. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Chapman, who died Tuesday at Providence St. Joseph Medical  
Center, began her working life not as an actress, but as a typist 
and switchboard operator in White Plains, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	She gave up the job in the late 1930s and went to New York City  
at the urging of friends, who praised her beauty. She graced the 
covers of numerous magazine as a John Powers model, catching the 
attention of Hollywood studio executives who invited her to be in 
movies. 
</P>
<P>
	From 1940 to 1943, Ms. Chapman appeared in 18 movies, ranging  
from Charlie Chan comedies to armed services booster films as a 
member of Warner Bros.' singing and dancing Navy Blues Sextet. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Chapman was eventually cast as a leading lady in  
``Destroyer'' with Edward G. Robinson and Glenn Ford and in 
``Appointment in Berlin'' opposite George Sanders. 
</P>
<P>
	After the war, she continued to win leading roles in such films  
as ``Relentless'' opposite Robert Young and ``The Green Promise'' 
with Walter Brennan. But by the 1950s, Ms. Chapman had slipped into 
supporting roles, notably as a secretary in ``The Seven Year Itch'' 
in 1955. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Chapman had top billing again in her final film, ``The  
Amazing Transparent Man'' in 1960, but the film was critically 
panned. 
</P>
<P>
	As Ms. Chapman's film career waned, she made guest appearances  
in television series including ``Richard Diamond, Private 
Detective,'' ``Rawhide,'' ``Perry Mason,'' ``Hawaii Five-0'' and 
``Marcus Welby, M.D.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She was asked to try out for the role of the elderly survivor in  
the 1997 mega-hit ``Titanic,'' but was too ill, said her niece, 
Norma Chapman Dolan of Clinton Corners, N.Y. The role eventually 
went to Gloria Stuart. 
</P>
<P>
	Her career has been recognized with a star on the Hollywood Walk  
of Fame.

<HEADLINE> Koreas in Dispute Over Waters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- South Korean fishermen gingerly sailed  
out Saturday to cast their nets in disputed waters in the Yellow 
Sea, despite concern over possible armed clashes with North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	Tension flared anew this week after communist North Korea  
threatened to use military force to gain control of contested 
waters surrounding five South Korean islands scattered along North 
Korea's southwest coast. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have not detected any sign of imminent danger,'' said Maj.  
Kim Nak-joong, a Defense Ministry spokesman. ``We don't see North 
Korean ships, military or civilian, near the zone. For now, it's 
all quiet there in the west sea.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Belligerent rhetoric is ``a worn-out North Korean tactic,'' but  
nonetheless South Korean marines and navy ships maintain high 
vigilance in the region, Kim said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Paengnyong, the westernmost of the five islands, a fleet of  
100 fishing boats escorted by navy patrol boats sailed into the 
disputed zone, which is teeming with anchovy, villagers said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are living so close to North Korea, and it makes us  
uneasy,'' said Kim Dae-shik, a Paengnyong resident. ``But we don't 
want to miss a fine fishing day. The weather is good. Things are as 
usual here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	North Korean threats prompted local authorities Friday to survey  
supplies of emergency food and other daily goods for 6,900 island 
residents, in case heightened tension should cut ferry service to 
the five islands. 
</P>
<P>
	North Korea had announced a territorial claim to waters around  
the islands Thursday, saying that it would protect its sovereignty 
by ``all means and measures.'' After a similar claim in 1974, South 
Korean warships escorted ferries to and from the islands for 
several months. 
</P>
<P>
	South Korea countered Friday that its will to protect the zone  
was unshakable. 
</P>
<P>
	Concern was rising that the claims of sovereignty might lead to  
new armed skirmishes. 
</P>
<P>
	The two Koreas are still technically at war, since their  
three-year war ended in 1953 with an armistice, not a peace treaty. 
The armistice never demarcated a sea border, and the American-led 
U.N. Command subsequently drew a line as a buffer to avoid armed 
clashes. 
</P>
<P>
	South and North Korea largely honored the border until mid-June,  
when North Korean warships passed it repeatedly, touching off a 
bloody naval clash. About 30 North Korean sailors were believed to 
have died when their torpedo boat was hit and sunk. 
</P>
<P>
	North Korean leader Kim Jong Il fired his navy chief, Adm. Kim  
Yun Sim, holding him responsible for the naval defeat, a South 
Korean Defense Ministry official said on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	In a dispatch late Friday, North Korea's official Pyongyang  
Radio also quoted Kim Jong Il as saying that ``tension on the 
peninsula has intensified to such a level that war could break out 
at any time.'' The radio, monitored by Seoul's national news agency 
Yonhap, did not say when Kim made the remark, which was similar to 
other North Korean saber-rattling rhetoric. 
</P>
<P>
	The territorial dispute has worsened tension caused by North  
Korea's threat to test-fire a new long-range missile. The nation 
sent shock waves through the region last year by test-firing a 
multistage missile that flew over Japan and landed in the Pacific.

<HEADLINE> Mrs. Clinton Opposes FALN Clemency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Potential Senate candidate Hillary Rodham  
Clinton said Saturday she opposes the release from prison of Puerto 
Rican nationalists offered clemency last month by her husband. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the administration first offered these prisoners  
clemency, I made it very clear that I had no involvement in or 
prior knowledge of the decision, as is entirely appropriate, and 
that the prisoners should not be released unless they renounced 
violence,'' Mrs. Clinton said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been three weeks and their silence speaks volumes,'' the  
first lady added. ``I believe the offer of clemency should be 
withdrawn.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons have come under fire from Republican critics and  
some law enforcement officials who claimed the president's clemency 
offer to 16 FALN members was aimed at helping his wife's political 
fortunes among New York's 1.3 million Puerto Ricans. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no immediate response Saturday from President Clinton  
to his wife's statement. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, a White House spokesman had said the president's Aug.  
11 clemency offer was not open-ended and that he expected a 
response within a week.

<HEADLINE> Greene, Devers Win 100s in Scotland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GLASGOW, Scotland (AP) -- Maurice Greene, ``totally tired'' from  
his triple-gold performance at the World Championships a week ago, 
won a relatively slow 100 meters at 10.16 seconds Saturday at the 
U.S.-Britain Challenge meet. 
</P>
<P>
	The world record-holder dipped at the tape to edge Britain's  
European champion Darren Campbell, the runner-up at 10.19. Briton 
Dwain Chambers, the bronze medalist at the worlds, was third at 
10.27. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene, who ran 9.80 to win at Seville, Spain -- just off his  
world record of 9.79 -- flashed a big smile at Campbell as they 
finished side by side, then did a victory lap for a receptive 
sellout crowd of 6,000 at Scotstoun Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't hard at all, we went out to have fun,'' Greene said.  
``It didn't make sense to come here and win by 50 meters, We came 
here to give them a close race. We did just that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a season-ending meet geared more to fun than tense  
competition, Gail Devers won the women's 100 in 11.33, then 
reminded that the meet ``wasn't about running fast times ... but to 
show appreciation to the fans. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States won the meet with 171 points to 143 for  
Britain, giving the Americans a 7-6 lead in the series. 
</P>
<P>
	Antonio Pettigrew, who has the second-fastest time in the world  
this season in the 400, held off Britain's Mark Richardson to win 
at 45.70. Kevin Little, sixth at Seville and a former world indoor 
champion, took the 200 at 20.51. 
</P>
<P>
	In the women's 400 hurdles, Joanna Hayes won at 55.56, beating  
American teammate Michelle Johnson. Americans went 1-2-3 in the 
men's 400 hurdles, with Joey Woody -- a finalist in the worlds -- 
winning at 49.09, followed by Calvin Davis and Torrance Zellner. 
</P>
<P>
	World record-holder Jonathan Edwards of Britain won the triple  
jump at 56 feet; Olympic champion Charles Austin won the high jump 
at 7-2 1/2; world record-holder and world champion Colin Jackson of 
Britain took the 110 hurdles at 13.35, and world silver medalist 
Regina Jacobs won the women's 1,500 at 4:04.31.

<HEADLINE> Bradley, Gore Want Labor's Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Bill Bradley tinkered with a position that has  
kept him at odds with the teachers' unions. Vice President Al Gore, 
having already tried to smooth things with steelworkers, honed an 
attack on Republicans -- his sharpest yet, aides promised -- in 
defense of unions. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democrats' political duel for organized labor, a balancing  
act for both candidates and a tighter-than-anticipated battle for 
Gore, heads into a crucial round this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	As a Labor Day kickoff, the two presidential rivals will stump  
Monday's parade routes, Bradley in homestate New Jersey and Gore in 
Iowa, home of the first nominating contest of next season. The vice 
president, stopping first in Michigan with AFL-CIO president John 
Sweeney, also planned a frenetic round of labor picnics and 
rallies. 
</P>
<P>
	Aides promised Gore, who has yet to attack GOP presidential  
front-runner George W. Bush by name, would lob his most direct hit 
to date on the Texas governor for supporting measures that would 
force unions to get approval from all members before spending their 
dues on politics. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're making labor's No. 1 issue our No. 1 issue this  
weekend,'' enthused Gore spokesman Chris Lehane. 
</P>
<P>
	At stake in the courtship of unions are the phone banks,  
door-knocking sweeps and car pools vital to winning early contests 
in Iowa and New Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
	The AFL-CIO is expected at its October meeting finally to throw  
the weight of its 13 million members behind the vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley had encouraged the federation, which first addressed a  
possible endorsement in February, to wait. That forced Gore to 
spend more time than he'd expected competing for the AFL-CIO 
imprimatur. 
</P>
<P>
	``The odds-on favorite right now would be Gore,'' said  
federation Secretary-Treasurer Richard Trumka. ``People have dealt 
with him for a while and they feel comfortable with him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Comfortable, but not ecstatic.  
</P>
<P>
	Neither Gore nor Bradley has a perfect record on issues dear to  
union members. Both supported NAFTA and the General Agreement on 
Trade and Tariffs, which unions bitterly fault for protecting an 
artist's intellectual property rights but not an American worker's 
right to keep his job from moving overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	AFL-CIO voting score cards from the years 1985 to 1992, when  
Bradley and Gore were in the Senate together, show nearly identical 
good ratings. Both support increasing the minimum wage. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley recently endorsed loosening picket rules, withholding  
government contracts from companies that violate labor laws and 
increasing damages against companies that fire employees for 
organizing unions. On Friday, Gore drew cheers from union women in 
Chicago when he pledged a war against ``union busting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think there's any substantive differences'' between  
the two, said Mark Smith, president of the Iowa Federation of 
Labor. 
</P>
<P>
	``They tend both to be supportive of the labor union, worker  
rights, organizing, the right of unions to exist,'' said Smith. 
``Both of them are screwed up on job security and trade.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both have labored of late to paste over the blemishes.  
</P>
<P>
	Last month, the Clinton-Gore administration unveiled a plan to  
bolster the troubled steel industry. The measure was valentine to 
steelworkers who blamed the White House for surging steel imports. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a first step, but we're obviously committed to doing  
as much as possible. Having a strong steel industry and strong 
steelworkers is good for America,'' Lehane said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Bradley backed off his voting record in favor of  
school voucher experiments, saying he does not now believe that 
giving parents public funds for private-school tuition is ``the 
answer to the problems of public education.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spokeswoman Anita Dunn said Bradley's votes for vouchers  
signified only that ``you cannot just outright eliminate any 
possibility'' for helping children trapped in bad schools. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue is a hot one for the 950,000 teachers in the American  
Federation of Teachers, which is likely to decide its endorsement 
in October. AFT president Sandra Feldman gave the advantage to 
Gore, saying, ``He is clear on his support for public education.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two candidates are playing tit for tat.  
</P>
<P>
	Bradley boasts that he is this season's only presidential  
candidate with a union pension. His allies point out that Gore, 
during his 1988 presidential campaign, supported the rights of 
states to pass ``right-to-work'' laws banning compulsory union 
membership. In the Senate, Bradley cast a pro-labor vote against 
such measures. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore has since changed his mind, aides said.  
</P>
<P>
	In turn, Gore allies noted that the same year of Gore's offense,  
Bradley committed his own with anti-labor votes on textile import 
limits and ``Buy American'' provisions. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore, who has courted Sweeney and other union bigwigs with  
access to the most intimate White House strategy sessions and 
social gatherings, has already bagged 16 union endorsements. He 
expects to collect more on this weekend's sweep through Michigan 
and Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	On Bradley's side, Dunn all but conceded the endorsement game,  
saying Bradley will continue to care about rank-and-file union 
members ``with or without endorsements.''

<HEADLINE> Agassi People's Choice at U.S. Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bare-chested Andre Agassi is the Pied Piper of  
the U.S. Open, a center court glamour guy in the absence of No. 1 
Pete Sampras and defending champion Patrick Rafter. 
</P>
<P>
	When he arrives on the grounds of the National Tennis Center to  
hit on off-days or before his matches, Agassi leads a merry parade 
to the practice courts and sheds his shirt, unveiling a chest that 
is every bit as bare as his shaved head. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just got tired of being hairy,'' he explained.  
</P>
<P>
	The crowd loves it.  
</P>
<P>
	So when Agassi dropped a set to unseeded Justin Gimelstob on  
Saturday, there was a bit of a gasp from his assembled 
congregation. 
</P>
<P>
	Not to worry. He restored order, riding his big save and bigger  
return to a 6-1, 4-6, 6-3, 6-4 victory that sent him into the 
second week of the Open. When it was over, and he was safely in the 
round of 16, Agassi blew kisses to the crowd and then paid the 
ultimate compliment to Gimelstob. 
</P>
<P>
	As the 22-year-old American sat in his chair, Agassi gathered  
his gear and strolled over. 
</P>
<P>
	``C'mon,'' he said. ``We're gonna walk off together.''  
</P>
<P>
	And they did.  
</P>
<P>
	``I kind of always feel at center court, that's the proper  
protocol,'' Agassi said, ``especially after a good match.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And Gimelstob gave him that, refusing to wilt under an early  
blitz. He bounced back to win the second set, but eventually Agassi 
wore him down. ``I'm proud the way I competed,'' Gimelstob said. 
</P>
<P>
	Agassi was low-key about the victory.  
</P>
<P>
	``I was a little disappointed with how I lost my serve,'' he  
said. ``That can happen. He had a good presence out there. He was 
standing in tight. He was taking some good cuts at it. He got the 
break and took care of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At that point, Gimelstob was pumped up, all even after two sets,  
the upset in his mind. 
</P>
<P>
	And then Agassi just ground him down.  
</P>
<P>
	At one point, Gimelstob complained to the chair over a blimp  
that was peeking in on the action at center court. 
</P>
<P>
	Agassi chuckled over that.  
</P>
<P>
	``I thought he was struggling with it,'' Agassi said. ``I only  
know a couple of people in New York who get that blimp moved, and 
it's not Justin.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Agassi nudged Gimelstob out of the way, advancing to the second  
week of the Open. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did what I needed to do,'' Agassi said. ``I felt pretty  
good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It has been that kind of summer for him. He was a surprise  
winner of the French Open, his fourth Grand Slam title, and then 
reached the finals at Wimbledon before losing to Sampras. He has 
won 31 of his last 35 matches and with the departure of Sampras and 
Rafter, he is the only former U.S. Open champion still in the 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps the only obstacle on Agassi's road to the final is No.  
12 Richard Krajicek, who could be waiting for him in the 
semifinals. They have split six previous meetings and Krajicek, the 
1996 Wimbledon champ who is equipped with the ingredients to 
prosper on hard courts, advanced with a 6-4, 6-1, 6-4 victory over 
John van Lottum on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	So what did Krajicek think of a potential pairing with Agassi,  
the people's choice in Flushing Meadows? 
</P>
<P>
	``First, I have to get there,'' he said. ``I have proven in the  
past that if I play well, I can beat anybody. If come next Saturday 
I'm still here and Andre's still here, we can have a good match.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Krajicek, however, is dealing with first things first.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is the first time in a long time that I've won three  
matches in a row,'' he said. ``I must try to make it four after 
this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That has not been a problem for Agassi in this summer of  
success.

<HEADLINE> National Baptists Seek New Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- One of the nation's largest black church  
groups tries to begin restoring its image this week when it 
replaces a former leader now in prison for using his position to 
steal money and finance a lavish lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
	Eleven candidates are vying for the presidency of the National  
Baptist Convention USA during the group's annual meeting that 
starts Tuesday in Tampa. 
</P>
<P>
	Members will vote to replace the Rev. Henry Lyons, who is  
serving 5 1/2 years in state prison on racketeering and grand theft 
convictions. He also pleaded guilty to federal charges of tax 
evasion and fraud, and was sentenced to a concurrent 4 1/4-year term. 
</P>
<P>
	Group leaders hope this year's meeting will help unite members  
of the 119-year-old organization, which has experienced contentious 
battles for power. A minister died after falling from a stage 
during a fight at the annual meeting in 1961. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's going to be some politicking, a lot of campaigning,''  
said the Rev. Stewart Cureton, of Greenville, S.C., the group's 
acting president, who is not a contender. 
</P>
<P>
	But, ``we cannot be divided now,'' Cureton said. ``I am in deep  
prayer ... that they will combine their efforts to support the 
person who does win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Convention leaders expect the meeting to draw about 60,000  
people to the Ice Palace Arena -- many of whom will be attracted by 
Thursday's scheduled election. While the group has claimed 8.5 
million members, prosecutors at Lyons' trial said the actual number 
is closer to 1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Its next leader will face some challenges.  
</P>
<P>
	Attendance at the convention-operated American Baptist College  
in Nashville, Tenn., is down. Loans to settle lawsuits are due. And 
nearly $3 million still is owed on the group's headquarters in 
Nashville, the Baptist World Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons, who was paid $100,000 a year as president, was convicted  
in February of swindling $4 million from businesses and failing to 
distribute nearly $250,000 contributed by the Anti-Defamation 
League of B'nai Brith to help rebuild burned black churches in the 
South. 
</P>
<P>
	In the wake of the scandal, some convention members want to  
restrict the president's power and make the officer more 
accountable for money raised and spent on the group's behalf. 
</P>
<P>
	Historically, an heir apparent has been obvious among a small  
group of contenders. But the succession is unclear with Lyons in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
	``The doors are kind of wide open,'' said the Rev. Edward V.  
Hill of Los Angeles, asked by the group's board to run for the 
seat. ``And there are plenty of people who believe they are the 
Messiah.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other candidates include ministers W. Franklyn Richardson of  
Mount Vernon, N.Y., and William J. Shaw, of Philadelphia, who 
finished second and third, respectively, to Lyons in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson and Shaw were among a group of convention members who  
tried to oust Lyons in 1997 as investigators probed whether he 
misused the group's funds to support a lifestyle that included a 
mistress, expensive jewelry, and a waterfront home. 
</P>
<P>
	Other church leaders seeking the post are from Richmond, Va.;  
Louisville, Ky.; Atlanta; Detroit; Indianapolis, Ind.; Greensboro, 
N.C.; and Homer, La.

<HEADLINE> Protests at French-Speaking Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONCTON, New Brunswick (AP) -- Supporters and opponents of  
Congolese President Laurent Kabila scuffled Saturday during a 
summit of Francophone leaders, and two people were arrested, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Three people were initially detained by Royal Canadian Mounted  
Police, but one was released because he was a delegation member and 
has diplomatic immunity, said RCMP spokesman Sgt. Mike Gaudet. The 
other two also were eventually released and no charges were filed. 
</P>
<P>
	The protest occurred outside the hotel hosting the eighth summit  
of La Francophonie, a group of French-speaking countries, many of 
them former French colonies in Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second day of protests at the summit by groups and  
individuals protesting the appearance of leaders they say have 
committed atrocities against civilians in their homeland. 
</P>
<P>
	On the opening day of the summit, dozens of demonstrators  
rallied outside the welcoming ceremony to demand Burundian 
President Pierre Buyoya be tried for war crimes and crimes against 
humanity. Buyoya staged a coup during the last Francophone summit 
in Canada in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, the main protest outside the summit site was  
between rival groups supporting and opposing Kabila, who has spent 
the last year fending off a rebellion supported by Rwanda and 
Uganda. 
</P>
<P>
	The rally was peaceful until the small scuffle broke out, Gaudet  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	No one was injured and no weapons were used, he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The clash was a stark indication of how human rights have  
dominated the summit, and served as a wake-up call to La 
Francophonie, which is primarily an organization dedicated to 
promoting French culture and language. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue gained momentum primarily because some of the  
countries attending -- including Congo, Burundi and Rwanda -- have 
seen some of the worst atrocities committed in recent years, with 
tens of thousands of civilians killed in rebellions, massacres and 
civil wars. 
</P>
<P>
	Activists had called on Canada to bar entry to some of the most  
notorious leaders, or at least initiate investigations into whether 
certain delegates had committed crimes against humanity. 
</P>
<P>
	The Globe and Mail daily said Friday in an editorial that Canada  
should take a stand against the dictators and speak out against 
human rights violations. 
</P>
<P>
	Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien told fellow heads of state  
in a working session Friday that he would like the organization to 
consider excluding violators, much as the Commonwealth of 
English-speaking countries does. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said there was little support for the proposal,  
particularly since the organization's charter doesn't allow for it. 
</P>
<P>
	French President Jacques Chirac has also taken a harder stand on  
what to do with certain member states, acknowledging that some were 
not ``worthy'' of taking part in the organization. 
</P>
<P>
	He has called for the swift startup of a watchdog group within  
the organization to monitor rights abuses in member countries.

<HEADLINE> Thrashers Sign Top Pick Stefan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Patrik Stefan was starting to fret. With only one  
day to go before he was scheduled to report to his first NHL 
training camp, the 18-year-old still didn't have a contract. 
</P>
<P>
	No contract, no camp.  
</P>
<P>
	``Of course I was worried,'' said Stefan, a center who was the  
top pick in the entry draft by the expansion Atlanta Thrashers. 
</P>
<P>
	His fears were unfounded. Stefan agreed to a three-year contract  
Friday and flew to Orlando, Fla., arriving a couple of hours before 
the Thrashers' first team meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, the league's newest team will take the ice for the  
first time. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's something I was pretty nervous about,'' said Stefan, who  
made a cross-country flight from Los Angeles to Orlando after the 
deal was finalized. ``But it's done now. It's great to be here. I'm 
excited and everything is perfect. I can't wait to play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stefan, who turns 19 on Sept. 16, will receive $3.075 million in  
base salary over the three years -- the maximum allowed for a rookie 
under the league's collective bargaining agreement -- but the deal 
was held up by the value of potential bonuses in the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither side would disclose the bonus structure, but The Atlanta  
Journal-Constitution reported that a complex series of individual 
bonuses was capped at $7.6 million for the life of the contract. 
</P>
<P>
	That falls short of the potentially most-lucrative rookie  
package, currently held by Tampa Bay's Vincent Lecavalier. 
</P>
<P>
	Lecavalier can earn up to $3 million annually in bonuses or $8  
million over the life of his three-year deal for reaching targets 
in games played, goals, assists, points, points per game and 
plus-minus rating. 
</P>
<P>
	Stefan also can earn several million dollars in bonuses based on  
team performance, but those will be more difficult to earn playing 
for an expansion team. 
</P>
<P>
	After weeks of negotiations, Stefan's agent, Steve Kotlowitz of  
Edmonton, and Thrashers general manager Don Waddell finally agreed 
on the bonuses Thursday night and finalized the deal Friday 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``Patrik has the potential to be an elite player in the NHL and  
having him in camp is an important part of his development,'' 
Waddell said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Thrashers traded up to land Stefan with the top pick in the  
draft. The 6-foot-2, 205-pound native of the Czech Republic played 
last season with Long Beach in the International Hockey League, 
totaling 11 goals and 24 assists in 33 games. His playing time was 
limited by a pair of concussions, but Atlanta's doctors insist his 
health is fine. 
</P>
<P>
	Stefan should make the Thrashers' 23-man roster but the team is  
hoping to bring him along slowly. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not too concerned with Patrik Stefan this year or next  
year,'' Waddell said. ``We want to bring him along right. I'm more 
concerned with where he is four or five years from now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also Friday, Atlanta agreed to a deal with its only other  
unsigned player, goalie Scott Langkow. The 24-year-old, who spent 
all but one game last season in the minors, is expected to provide 
minor league insurance behind Damian Rhodes and Norm Maracle.

<HEADLINE>  Small Turnout for Peaceful NYC Rally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The second Million Youth March drew about 2,000  
people to the streets of Harlem on Saturday after weeks of 
name-calling and a legal tug-of-war between organizers and city 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
	The rally was calm in contrast to last year's march, which ended  
in a bottle-throwing melee and 28 injuries after police in riot 
gear tried to enforce a court-ordered curfew. 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers opened Saturday's rally with a prayer, and most of  
the speakers offered uplifting messages encouraging black youths to 
stay in school and to treat one another with dignity. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whose streets? Our streets!'' shouted one group of marchers,  
although most of the participants were more subdued. Paulette 
Washington, who works in Harlem, was walking with a sandwich board 
with the words: ``Execute racism.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If we can't live together, we'll die together,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	The rally was monitored by 1,500 police officers, some stationed  
on rooftops. They did not arrive in riot gear this year, and there 
were about half as many officers as in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	No conflicts were reported.  
</P>
<P>
	Prior to this year's march, organizer Khallid Abdul Muhammad  
labeled Mayor Rudolph Giuliani a ``cracker'' after the mayor called 
the rally a ``hate march.'' Organizers took the city to court to 
get a permit for the rally when city officials turned them down, as 
they did in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's crowd was barely a third of last year's turnout of  
6,000. Reporters covering the event estimated there were about 
2,000 people; police estimated there were under 1,000. Harlem 
politicians had encouraged a boycott of the march after Muhammad -- 
a former Nation of Islam spokesman fired for his anti-Semitic 
comments -- made inflammatory statements during the Million Youth 
March's debut last year. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, Giuliani thanked New Yorkers for the relatively  
low turnout. ``Today, New Yorkers demonstrated by their absence, 
their overwhelming support for tolerance and decency,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	During his hour-long speech, Muhammad attacked Giuliani,  
labeling those who called for a boycott ``Uncle Toms,'' and 
accusing Jews of sanctioning slavery. Muhammad's address ended the 
rally, with the crowd dispersing quietly. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney Malik Shabazz, another rally organizer, held up a  
picture of the mayor at the rally Saturday and told the crowd, ``We 
charge this man with crimes against the black nation!'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Guilty! Guilty!'' some shouted back.  
</P>
<P>
	Shabazz also made anti-Semitic remarks and told the crowd, ``The  
only solution any time there is a funeral in the black community is 
a funeral in the police community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While some in the crowd applauded the speakers and joined a  
chant of ``Black power,'' others along Malcolm X Boulevard were 
apathetic. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't both me as long as it goes smoothly,'' said Gloria  
Johnson. ``It's OK to have a Million Youth March as long as it's 
done with finesse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two teens from the Bronx, Devon Speaks and Robert Pitts, said  
they attended the rally to judge it for themselves. Neither had 
much positive to say about Muhammad. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think what he has to say is a lot of foolishness,'' said  
Pitts, 14.

<HEADLINE> Comets Heavily Favored To Three-Peat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Just because the Houston Comets are on the brink  
of their third championship in the WNBA's third season doesn't mean 
coach Van Chancellor has suddenly become an optimist. 
</P>
<P>
	Overconfidence ``was one of my greatest concerns coming into  
today's practice,'' Chancellor said Friday. ``When I left New York 
this morning, needless to say I came in here and kind of got after 
them, but they had just great focus. 
</P>
<P>
	``In three years, I have to say there have not been many times  
they have come in here and been overconfident.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As the Comets head into what could be a deciding second game of  
their best-of-3 series with the New York Liberty on Saturday, they 
seem to have every reason in the world to expect a victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston is 34-2 at home the last two seasons and has never lost  
a playoff game on its home court. 
</P>
<P>
	In Thursday's 73-60 victory in Game 1, the Comets' top-rated  
defense held New York to just 26 percent shooting in the first 
half. Cynthia Cooper, meanwhile, took care of the offense. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, she's at the top of her game right now,'' Liberty  
coach Richie Adubato said of Cooper, who matched her championship 
record with 29 points Thursday while holding New York star Teresa 
Weatherspoon to 5. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite overwhelming odds in their favor, Cooper vowed to take  
nothing for granted. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know they're not going to come in and just lie down,''  
Cooper cautioned. 
</P>
<P>
	Weatherspoon seconded that.  
</P>
<P>
	``They're supposed to throw everything at you,'' she said of the  
Comets' defensive onslaught. ``We're trying to do the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not coming in with our heads down. We just want to prove  
some things to ourselves, and not anyone else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As Adubato spoke to reporters Friday, WNBA officials handed out  
a news release announcing the veteran coach was fined $1,500 for 
criticizing the officials Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sept. 2 was my wife's birthday. I guess she's not getting  
jewelry this year,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Flames Acquire Fuhr from the Blues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CALGARY, Alberta (AP) -- In an effort to gain some experience at  
goaltender, the Calgary Flames on Saturday acquired Grant Fuhr from 
the St. Louis Blues for a third-round draft pick in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Fuhr, who will turn 37 later this month, has a 3.37  
goals-against average in 845 NHL games. He posted a 16-11-8 record 
with a 2.44 goals-against average in 39 games last season when he 
was beset by injuries, including knee surgery in February. 
</P>
<P>
	He won five Stanley Cup titles in the 1980s with the Edmonton  
Oilers and ranks sixth on the career win list with 398. 
</P>
<P>
	``Grant Fuhr's accomplishments for the St. Louis Blues and the  
sport of hockey have been tremendous,'' Blues general manager Larry 
Pleau said. ``He is truly one of the greatest goaltenders to have 
ever played in this league and will someday be inducted into the 
hockey hall of fame.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Flames had been searching for experience after losing  
veteran Ken Wregget as a free agent to the Detroit Red Wings. Other 
names, such as Ron Hextall and Glenn Healy, had also popped up in 
the rumor mill. 
</P>
<P>
	``Grant Fuhr is unquestionably a Hall of Fame goaltender,''  
Flames general manager Al Coates said in a release. ``Our 
commitment is to win and this acquisition helps us in that regard 
while enhancing ... the development of our young team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Flames have three relatively inexperienced goalies in  
Jean-Sebastien Giguere, Tyler Moss and Fred Brathwaite, but none 
has shown conclusively he's ready for the No. 1 job. 
</P>
<P>
	Brathwaite endeared himself to Calgary fans last season when a  
rash of injuries caused the Flames to summon him from the Canadian 
national team. He played in 14 consecutive games in January, 
posting a 5-4-5 record. 
</P>
<P>
	Giguere, 22, spent much of last season with the Flames' AHL  
affiliate and was inconsistent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blues used four goaltenders besides Fuhr last season. Jamie  
McLennan was the backup most of last season and the team also used 
rookie Brent Johnson, Rich Parent and Jim Carey. 
</P>
<P>
	In need of a solid starter, the Blues traded a third-round draft  
pick to Dallas for Roman Turek in June. The 29-year-old backed up 
Ed Belfour last season in Dallas. He was 16-3-3 with one shutout 
and a 2.02 goals-against average for the Stanley Cup champions and 
tied for 10th in the NHL with a .925 save percentage. 
</P>
<P>
	Turek made his NHL debut in 1996-97 with the Stars, going 3-1  
with a 2.05 goals-against average. The following season he was 
11-10-1 with a 2.22 goals-against and one shutout.

<HEADLINE> MDs Give Prostate Patients Hope </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- One of men's greatest fears about prostate  
cancer surgery is that it will leave them impotent. Now Texas 
surgeons hunting a solution have successfully transplanted a nerve 
from men's legs into the pelvic area to restore erectile function. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, only a very small number of men have received this  
experimental nerve graft during prostate cancer surgery. But enough 
are regaining erectile function that the doctors told The 
Associated Press the early results signal an important advance. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is no question but that it's an exciting therapy and it's  
going to become very widespread,'' said Dr. Rahul Nath, a nerve 
specialist at Baylor College of Medicine who meticulously stitches 
the new nerve into place. 
</P>
<P>
	Many urologists were openly skeptical -- some laughed -- when  
surgeons from Baylor and M.D. Anderson Cancer Center told medical 
meetings they were going to try the procedure. 
</P>
<P>
	``People thought this was the most ridiculous thing they'd ever  
heard of,'' recalled M.D. Anderson urologist Dr. Christopher G. 
Wood. ``You could come up with a million explanations for why this 
shouldn't work -- but if it does work, who cares?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Surgery to remove the walnut-sized prostate gland can damage the  
delicate cavernous nerves, tiny nerves that nestle on either side 
of the prostate and are vital for erectile function. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nerve-sparing surgery,'' developed at Johns Hopkins  
University, has helped many men avoid impotency after prostate 
surgery. But nerve-sparing surgery doesn't always work -- there's a 
30 percent to 60 percent chance of erections afterwards, depending 
on the surgeon's skill and the extent of the cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Some men must have both cavernous nerves removed for their best  
chance at getting rid of all the cancer, leaving them with no 
erectile function. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you have to remove a nerve, why don't you just put another  
one in?'' Baylor urologist Dr. Edward Kim suggested. 
</P>
<P>
	After all, plastic surgeons have successfully transplanted other  
nerves, muscle or sensory nerves mostly in the face and arms. While 
one previous attempt in prostate cancer patients failed, 
microsurgical techniques have recently improved and scientists have 
restored erectile function in experiments with rats. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, the Texas urologists are offering nerve grafts as the last  
step in prostate surgery for certain men who need both cavernous 
nerves removed -- those who have no chance of sexual function 
without it. (The procedure cannot help men who already completed 
surgery.) 
</P>
<P>
	When those nerves are cut out, stumps of nerve fibers connecting  
to the penis, and stumps of fibers running back to the spinal cord, 
are left behind. The necessary nerve signals to cause an erection 
can't jump the gap between the two stumps. 
</P>
<P>
	That's where plastic surgeons step in. They remove a piece of a  
sensory nerve called the sural nerve from the back of the patient's 
ankle, leaving a numb spot slightly larger than a half-dollar on 
the man's foot. 
</P>
<P>
	They carefully sew the sural nerve piece onto each end of the  
nerve stumps, creating a bridge between the nerve fibers. 
</P>
<P>
	Without this nourishing bridge, nerve fibers leading to the  
penis would immediately shrivel and die. But in the Texas study, 
the original nerve fibers are regrowing over the transplanted nerve 
until eventually both ends reconnect, Kim and Wood explained. 
</P>
<P>
	It grows very slowly -- most men won't know until 14-18 months  
after surgery if they'll regain erectile function, the doctors 
cautioned. And to regain function, men also require months of 
physical therapy. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the 14 patients operated on long enough ago to start  
measuring the surgery's success, four now have sexual intercourse. 
Seven more have partial erections, not quite strong enough for 
intercourse. The impotence pill Viagra helps some of those men have 
sex, but Kim said it's too soon to tell if their nerve function 
will continue improving so they won't need sexual help. 
</P>
<P>
	With their cavernous nerves gone, none of the men should have  
erectile function unless the nerve graft really is working. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the first human regeneration of a ``parasynthetic nerve,''  
a particularly complex type of nerve that helps control various 
organs, Nath said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't tell you the number of times I've sat in front of  
these poor guys and you can just see it in their eyes -- the anxiety 
because they're saying to themselves, 'I'm trading my life for my 
sex life,''' Wood said. ``This offers them an opportunity to 
maximize cancer control and a relatively good chance at preserving 
potency.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although the Texas doctors' results haven't yet been evaluated  
by other scientists -- Kim will present early results at an 
impotence meeting in Boston in October -- some urologists are 
intrigued. 
</P>
<P>
	Physiologically, there's no reason a nerve graft couldn't work,  
said Dr. David G. McLeod, chief of urologic oncology at Walter Reed 
Army Medical Center, who has discussed the experiment with one of 
its inventors. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll be looking into it,'' McLeod said. ``I greet it with  
interest, not skepticism.''

<HEADLINE> Mrs. Clinton Opposes FALN Clemency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Potential Senate candidate Hillary Rodham  
Clinton said Saturday she opposes the release from prison of Puerto 
Rican nationalists offered clemency last month by her husband. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the administration first offered these prisoners  
clemency, I made it very clear that I had no involvement in or 
prior knowledge of the decision, as is entirely appropriate, and 
that the prisoners should not be released unless they renounced 
violence,'' Mrs. Clinton said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been three weeks and their silence speaks volumes,'' the  
first lady added. ``I believe the offer of clemency should be 
withdrawn.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons have come under fire from Republican critics and  
some law enforcement officials who claimed the president's clemency 
offer to 16 FALN members was aimed at helping his wife's political 
fortunes among New York's 1.3 million Puerto Ricans. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no immediate response Saturday from President Clinton  
to his wife's statement. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, a White House spokesman had said the president's Aug.  
11 clemency offer was not open-ended and that he expected a 
response within a week.

 *Marguerite Chapman    	
</P>
<P>
	BURBANK , Calif. (AP) -- Marguerite Chapman, who starred in a  
series of World War II movies and later as a secretary in Marilyn 
Monroe's film the ``The Seven Year Itch,'' died Tuesday. She was 
81. 
</P>
<P>
	From 1940 to 1943, Ms. Chapman appeared in 18 movies, ranging  
from Charlie Chan comedies to armed services booster films as a 
member of Warner Bros.' singing and dancing Navy Blues Sextet. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Chapman was eventually cast as a leading lady in  
``Destroyer'' with Edward G. Robinson and Glenn Ford and in 
``Appointment in Berlin'' opposite George Sanders. 
</P>
<P>
	After the war, she continued to win leading roles in such films  
as ``Relentless'' opposite Robert Young and ``The Green Promise'' 
with Walter Brennan. But by the 1950s, Ms. Chapman had slipped into 
supporting roles, notably as a secretary in ``The Seven Year Itch'' 
in 1955. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Chapman had top billing again in her final film, ``The  
Amazing Transparent Man'' in 1960, but the film was critically 
panned. 
</P>
<P>
	As Ms. Chapman's film career waned, she made guest appearances  
in television series including ``Richard Diamond, Private 
Detective,'' ``Rawhide,'' ``Perry Mason,'' ``Hawaii Five-0'' and 
``Marcus Welby, M.D.'' 

</P>

 *Peter Gilman    	
</P>
<P>
	HILO, Hawaii (AP) -- Peter Gilman, whose best-selling novel was  
turned into the movie ``Diamond Head,'' died Wednesday. He was 73. 
</P>
<P>
	Gilman was a reporter for The Honolulu Star-Bulletin in the  
1950s when he wrote ``Such Sweet Thunder,'' which topped The New 
York Times Best Seller List. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbia Pictures paid $100,000 for the book in 1959.  
</P>
<P>
	The novel was turned into the 1960 movie ``Diamond Head,''  
starring Charlton Heston. 
</P>
<P>
	Following his success, Gilman moved to Paris, where he joined a  
group of fellow-expatriate writers that included James Jones, James 
Baldwin and William Styron. 
</P>
<P>
	Gilman later trained polo ponies in Argentina, and became an  
artist and commercial fisherman in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	Born in New York, Gilman graduated from UCLA, and went on to  
work for the Monterey Peninsula Herald in California, The 
Associated Press and The Los Angeles Times. 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors include three sons.

 *Charles Perry    	
</P>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Charles ``Chuck'' Perry, founding president of  
Florida International University, died at his home in Rockwall, 
Texas on Monday. He was 62. 
</P>
<P>
	Perry was just 31 when the Florida Board of Regents hired him in  
1969 to turn an abandoned airfield into a public university. 
</P>
<P>
	FIU started classes in September 1972 with a founding student  
body of 5,600. Before then, the Miami area was among the largest in 
the country without a public university. 
</P>
<P>
	Perry's colleagues and successors credit him with guiding the  
fledgling university through hostile politics and allowing it to 
break out of that state-imposed box when its political base was 
strong enough. 
</P>
<P>
	Perry stepped down from the presidency in 1975, after telling  
reporters he was having trouble making the transition from the 
excitement of building FIU to the routine of administering it. 
After 2 1/2 years heading corporations, including Golden Bear 
International and Family Weekly magazine, he became dean of the 
Graduate School of Management at the University of Dallas in 1993.

<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Stanley Weigel , a retired federal judge  
who made decisions on school desegregation and the U.S. involvement 
in Nicaragua, died Wednesday a few months after suffering a stroke. 
He was 93. 
</P>
<P>
	Weigel ordered the city's schools desegregated in 1971. In the  
1980s, he backed attempts to uncover U.S. involvement in Nicaragua 
and issued rulings that led to improved living conditions for state 
prison inmates. 
</P>
<P>
	Weigel was born in Helena, Mont., and grew up in San Francisco,  
attending Lowell High School and receiving undergraduate and law 
degrees from Stanford University. 
</P>
<P>
	After serving as a Navy officer during World War II, Weigel  
returned to private practice and defended 31 members of the 
University of California faculty who were fired for refusing to 
sign oaths that they did not belong to the Communist Party. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1952, the state Supreme Court ordered the professors  
reinstated.

<HEADLINE> Dennis Washes Ashore in N. Carolina </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOREHEAD CITY, N.C. (AP) -- After a week of wandering off the  
North Carolina coast, Tropical Storm Dennis washed ashore Saturday 
afternoon and dumped torrential rains through much of eastern North 
Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no reports of significant damage or injuries.  
Flooding was reported in several coastal counties, along with 
scattered power outages. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Weather Service reported that the center of Dennis'  
huge eye crossed the Core Banks shortly before 5 p.m. just south of 
Cedar Island. Sustained winds for the storm were clocked at 70 mph, 
just short of hurricane force, when it came ashore. Later in the 
night maximum sustained winds decreased to about 50 mph 
</P>
<P>
	Residents of fishing villages on the marshy peninsula where the  
storm hit said damage from the storm Saturday were not as bad as 
Monday when it pounded them on its first pass. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like a calm period right now,'' Cecile Huneycutt of  
Gloucester said as the leading edge of the storm's eye passed 
through. ``We've had a lot of rain. 
</P>
<P>
	``The water's everywhere,'' she said. ``Our yards are just about  
under, but it's not close to getting into the house.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Addertion, emergency management coordinator for Carteret  
County, said it appeared the worst was over once the storm made 
landfall. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's under control, I believe,'' Addertion said.  
</P>
<P>
	Dennis was expected to weaken rapidly as it sailed northwest  
through North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	Nobody was sad to see it go after nearly two weeks off the U.S.  
coast, said Stacy Stewart, a meteorologist at the National 
Hurricane Center in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like a dripping faucet that won't quit and won't go  
away,'' Stewart said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis has been anything but a typical storm, said Stacy Stewart  
of the National Hurricane Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart said tropical storm force or stronger winds usually  
affect a single area for 12 hours or less on average. ``That 
includes the approach, the center passing over, and retreating.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``North Carolina has been getting battered for pretty close to a  
week,'' Stewart said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tropical storm warnings were in effect along much of the North  
Carolina shoreline and extended north along the Virginia coast to 
Chincoteague, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	Farther north, in southeastern Virginia, an apparent tornado  
touched down in the city of Hampton, damaging several apartment 
buildings and an assisted living center, and injuring more than a 
dozen people. 
</P>
<P>
	Another twister hit a barn and snapped utility poles in nearby  
Chesapeake, Va., police said. 
</P>
<P>
	At 11 p.m., Dennis was centered 10 miles northwest of New Bern  
and moving northwest at about 9 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Flooding closed roads farther north in Craven and Pamlico  
counties. Flooding also was reported as far north as Elizabeth 
City. 
</P>
<P>
	Floodwaters forced officials in the Beaufort County town of  
Belhaven to move police operations from the police department to 
the municipal building, which is on higher ground. 
</P>
<P>
	As Dennis headed inland, emergency management officials opened  
18 shelters in nine coastal counties. 
</P>
<P>
	Tourists on Hatteras Island who ignored evacuation orders last  
weekend found themselves stranded for a second time Saturday when 
the rising wind from the approaching storm disrupted ferry service 
to the mainland. 
</P>
<P>
	A few tourists had left the island Thursday and Friday when the  
first ferries delivered emergency supplies and heavy equipment to 
Hatteras and Ocracoke Island. 
</P>
<P>
	Engineers worked Saturday to rebuild N.C. 12, the only highway  
along the low-lying, fragile Outer Banks. The highway had been open 
to residents with four-wheel-drive vehicles, but was closed again 
Saturday afternoon as the wind increased and torrential rain 
flooded the island. 
</P>
<P>
	As the storm moved inland Saturday evening, 80 people took  
shelter at Pamlico County Community College in Grantsboro, said Tim 
Harvey, the county's emergency management coordinator.

<HEADLINE> Carolina Gets Hurricane Warning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOREHEAD CITY, N.C. (AP) -- Tropical Storm Dennis closed in on  
the already battered North Carolina coast on Saturday, threatening 
to strengthen into a hurricane again. Some people were stranded for 
a second time on the Outer Banks islands as ferries shut down. 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasters said Dennis was likely to be a minimal hurricane by  
the time it hit land just northeast of Morehead City late Saturday, 
and hurricane warnings were in effect along much of the North 
Carolina shoreline. Tropical storm warnings extended northward 
along the Virginia coast to Chincoteague. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents of the fishing villages on the marshy peninsula where  
the storm was expected to strike were more frustrated than worried 
as the storm approached. 
</P>
<P>
	``We put our boats in the harbor down here last Saturday and we  
ain't got out yet,'' said Jonathan Robinson, a commercial fisherman 
from Stacy. ``We're anticipating more bad weather, but hopefully it 
won't be as bad as the initial hit. We'll be glad to see Dennis 
going.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In spite of 30-foot swells, a few fishermen did go to sea  
earlier in the week after Dennis made its first pass along the 
coast, but most waited for the weather to improve. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not been fittin' to play golf,'' Robinson said. ``I think  
most of 'em are just hangin' in there listening to the weather 
reports and drinking some coffee, or a few beers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Farther north, in southeastern Virginia, an apparent tornado  
touched down in the city of Hampton, damaging several apartment 
buildings and an assisted living center, and 20 to 30 people 
suffered minor injuries, police spokesman Jeff Walden said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another twister hit a barn and snapped utility poles in nearby  
Chesapeake, Va., police said. 
</P>
<P>
	At 3 p.m. EDT Saturday, the storm was centered about 25 miles  
east-southeast of Cape Lookout and about 55 miles south-southwest 
of Cape Hatteras, the National Weather Service said. It was moving 
toward the northwest at about 10 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	The storm's top sustained wind had strengthened slightly to 70  
mph, and was expected to reach minimal hurricane strength of 74 mph 
by the time its center reached shore, said Michael Moneypenny of 
the weather service office in Raleigh. He said Dennis would weaken 
rapidly over land while dropping heavy rainfall. 
</P>
<P>
	``There wouldn't be a whole lot of damage. Most of it would be  
flooding from the sound side,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cedar Island, a small community about four miles from Stacy, or  
25 miles northeast of Morehead City, was about three-quarters under 
water by early afternoon as the wind pushed water into the area, 
Moneypenny said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rain spread inland from Maryland to southern North Carolina as  
the storm approached. 
</P>
<P>
	Tourists on Hatteras Island who ignored evacuation orders last  
weekend found themselves stranded for a second time Saturday when 
the rising wind from the approaching storm disrupted ferry service 
to the mainland. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're stuck,'' said Martha Bourne of Beaufort, who got to the  
Hatteras ferry landing in time to learn that service had been shut 
down as Dennis moved closer to shore. 
</P>
<P>
	A few tourists had left the island Thursday and Friday when the  
first ferries delivered emergency supplies and heavy equipment to 
Hatteras and Ocracoke Island. 
</P>
<P>
	Engineers worked Saturday to rebuild N.C. 12, the only highway  
along the low-lying, fragile Outer Banks. The highway had been open 
to residents with four-wheel-drive vehicles, but was closed again 
Saturday afternoon as the wind increased and torrential rain 
flooded the island. 
</P>
<P>
	The storm's first pass tore out a half-mile section of the road  
north of Buxton, and reconstruction work was expected to take 
several days.

<HEADLINE> Summit Draws Attention to Acadia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONCTON, New Brunswick (AP) -- The land known as Acadia  
disappeared from maps nearly 300 years ago, when the French 
colonial settlement was lost to the British after years of war for 
what are now Canada's maritime provinces. 
</P>
<P>
	But Acadians and their culture are alive and well in  
French-speaking New Brunswick, perfectly happy to remain part of 
Canada and deeply distrustful of the independence aspirations of 
their fellow Francophones in nearby Quebec. 
</P>
<P>
	It's no coincidence that Canada chose to highlight the Acadians  
at a Francophone summit here this weekend -- to show that not all 
French Canadians support Quebec's sovereignty and actually fear 
what an independent Quebec might mean for their own well-being. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can live together in harmony. We're a good example to  
Quebec,'' said Roger Gaudet, a father of four who can trace his 
family history back to an original French settlement in Nova 
Scotia. 
</P>
<P>
	The 300,000 people of Acadian descent in Canada's Atlantic  
provinces -- New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island and 
Newfoundland - worry most that an independent Quebec will only make 
it harder for them to preserve the French culture they have fought 
for 300 years to retain. 
</P>
<P>
	``The balance of power between Anglos and Francophones rests on  
a strong Quebec presence at the federal level,'' said Maurice 
Basque, director of Acadian studies at the University of Moncton, 
the largest Francophone university in the region. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without Quebec, the question will become: `Will Canada remain  
bilingual?''' 
</P>
<P>
	Quebec's sovereignty has been put on the back page for the time  
being, after voters rejected sovereignty in successive referendums 
in recent years. Secessionists are vowing to try again in a few 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Quebec legislator Francine Lalonde said the province will one  
day be its own country -- with or without support from Acadians. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact that Quebec will be a French country in association  
with Canada would be a plus for them in all sorts of ways,'' she 
said. Quebec would continue to agitate for better French schools 
and services for the rest of French-speaking Canada, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	At the core of the Acadian argument against separation for  
Quebec is their own history and the event that defined them -- the 
deportation of 10,000 Acadians from Nova Scotia by Britain 
beginning in 1755 for refusing to swear allegiance to the queen. 
</P>
<P>
	Many resettled in Louisiana, where they are now called Cajuns,  
but others returned to the provinces to reclaim the land of their 
ancestors and rekindle their French identity with Canada's 
blessing. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, Acadians make up about a third of the population of New  
Brunswick -- too small a minority to challenge Ottawa for 
independence, but large enough to have successfully lobbied for 
public schools that teach entirely in French. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, French President Jacques Chirac paid tribute to  
their courage, telling a crowd of several hundred people how 
honored he was to be among so many people loyal to France. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know the immense road your people have traveled since the  
tragic ordeals that have marked your identity for centuries,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	That recognition is enough to keep Acadians content with the  
status quo, said Acadian student Eric Larocque. 
</P>
<P>
	``Acadia was erased from the maps in the 1700s,'' he said. ``It  
doesn't exist but in the hearts of those who fought to save our 
language and culture.''

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers Ponder Crop Insurance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Farming is a risky business in a stormy area  
of the Great Plains known as Tornado Alley. ``We know there's going 
to be a disaster,'' said Jerry Reynolds, who farms near Woodston, 
Kan. ``We just don't know what kind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reynolds, who lost some of his wheat to hail this year, tries to  
protect his investment by purchasing federally subsidized crop 
insurance, but the program is so inadequate that many of his 
neighbors don't even bother to buy it, he said. The insurance only 
covers half the value of his wheat crop. 
</P>
<P>
	``What's available at the present time is so cost-ineffective,  
it's a joke,'' McReynolds said. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress is trying to do something about the problem. With the  
farm economy crippled by recession, lawmakers are seeking ways to 
weave a new safety net for growers without scrapping the 1996 farm 
law that phased out the old Depression-era price support system. 
Crop insurance is considered a crucial part of the safety net. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers want to substantially lower premiums by doubling the  
insurance program's cost to taxpayers to about $3 billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
	The government currently pays 13 percent to 57 percent of the  
premium, with farmers picking up the rest. Under a bill approved by 
the House Agriculture Committee last month, the government subsidy 
would range from 31 percent to 67 percent, depending on the level 
of coverage. The legislation also boosts coverage for farmers who 
suffered one or two major crop losses in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar bills that have been introduced in the Senate. A rival  
plan is being pushed by the chairman of the Senate Agriculture 
Committee, Sen. Dick Lugar, R-Ind. Rather than reduce premiums, 
Lugar wants to give direct payments to growers to spend as they 
choose. 
</P>
<P>
	There's still a question of whether farmers will buy the  
insurance if they think Congress will provide them with disaster 
aid each year. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress gave farmers $6 billion in 1998 to compensate for  
weather-related crop failures and low commodity prices and is 
considering even more assistance this year. The Senate approved a 
$7.4 billion aid package in August, and the Clinton administration 
is working on a request for more than that. 
</P>
<P>
	``The political process has been pretty good at providing  
disaster aid -- if you knew your loss was going to be covered, would 
you buy insurance on your house, for example?'' said Kansas State 
University agriculture professor Art Barnaby. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnaby guesses that lawmakers might hold off on reforming crop  
insurance till next spring. 
</P>
<P>
	Passage of this year's disaster aid is the top priority of Rep.  
Jo Ann Emerson, a Missouri Republican who serves on the House 
Appropriations subcommittee that handles farm spending. While new 
ideas are critical, she said, they won't help producers struggling 
with this year's low prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think anyone believes crop insurance is a panacea for  
solving the farm crisis,'' Emerson said. ``Anything we do with 
regard to crop insurance won't apply to the crisis farmers are 
facing this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McReynolds, the Kansas farmer, says the money Congress spends on  
disaster aid would be better spent on new risk-management programs 
for farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Disaster programs are not the best way to handle it, no. I  
think we need a more stable program than that. Crop insurance is a 
way to go,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics say the current crop insurance program doesn't work  
where disasters have struck several years in a row because policies 
are based on past crop yields. If yields drop, so does the 
available coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	And if a producer, spurred by flexibility in the 1996 law,  
plants a completely new crop, insurers aren't willing to cover it 
until a few years later, when it is established. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers are trying to address those problems by creating an  
average production history credit program for startup farmers or 
those who have added land or rotated crops. It adjusts the history 
for producers who have suffered calamities.

<HEADLINE> Leaf Stays on Chargers' Roster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- The San Diego Chargers have some hope for Ryan  
Leaf this year, after all. 
</P>
<P>
	Although he won't be able to start throwing passes again for  
three weeks, Leaf will open his second NFL season as the San Diego 
Chargers' third-string quarterback. The team made it official 
Saturday by cutting Craig Whelihan, whose fourth interception of 
the exhibition season led to San Diego's 34-27 loss to Kansas City 
on Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Whelihan's shaky preseason was just part of the dynamic in  
keeping Leaf on the active roster behind Jim Harbaugh and Erik 
Kramer. The biggest factor, coach Mike Riley said, were the medical 
reports showing that Leaf was progressing so well with his 
rehabilitation following surgery on his right shoulder on July 26. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, the Chargers said Leaf could be out 3-to-4 months,  
and wondered if they'd be able to hold a roster spot open for him. 
</P>
<P>
	But Riley said Saturday that Leaf could be in playing shape by  
late October, although that doesn't guarantee that he'd be anything 
more than the third-stringer. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a good bit of our season left and we would think that  
he should be in our top three quarterbacks and not just completely 
shelved for the year,'' Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm grateful in more ways than you can say,'' said Leaf, who  
was benched midway through his turbulent rookie season. 
</P>
<P>
	It's somewhat of a gamble to start the season with just two  
healthy quarterbacks -- and Harbaugh and Kramer have histories of 
injuries -- but the Chargers couldn't spare a spot for Whelihan 
while waiting for Leaf to fully recover. 
</P>
<P>
	As it is, they're thin at receiver and are holding a spot for  
Charlie Jones, who's expected to miss the first four games with a 
dislocated hip. 
</P>
<P>
	Had Leaf been placed on injured reserve, he would have been lost  
for the season. Some in the organization worried that going on IR 
might alienate Leaf even more than last year, when he lost his 
teammates' confidence due to his many meltdowns on and off the 
field. 
</P>
<P>
	``It feels like I got drafted again,'' Leaf said. ``Now we get  
the perfect situation where I come into and you've got the two 
veteran quarterbacks there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If that situation had existed when Leaf was taken with the  
second pick overall of the 1998 draft, and given the richest 
contract in club history, he might not have been rushed into 
action. He finished with 15 interceptions and just two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody wishes they would have a situation like this,'' Leaf  
said. ``And I screwed up a lot of situations. But I want to get 
past it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully they've seen how hard I've been working in rehab to  
get to this point. But I also think they're just standing behind me 
and saying, `He's going to develop into the quarterback we drafted 
him as.' That's a very big confidence boost to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Riley said Leaf should be able to start throwing the ball in  
three weeks and begin practicing in 4-to-7 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Riley said the Chargers appreciated Leaf's hard work in rehab.  
But he also mentioned Leaf's frustrations this summer, which 
included Leaf telling Riley he wanted to be traded if he was put on 
injured reserve. 
</P>
<P>
	Can Leaf make it this time?  
</P>
<P>
	``It depends on his attitude and personality,'' Pro Bowl safety  
Rodney Harrison said. ``If he stays positive and within the 
framework of the team structure and doesn't separate himself, he'll 
be OK. We still support him, but enough is enough. We're ready to 
get this thing started and turned around. There's still a great 
chance he can be a great quarterback.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whelihan was popular with his teammates. But he threw 19  
interceptions last year after taking over for Leaf. He was 2-12 as 
a starter, including 0-7 in 1997 after Stan Humphries was sidelined 
with his second concussion of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chargers cut four receivers Saturday among their 16 roster  
moves, leaving them with three healthy wideouts. They must make two 
more cuts by Sunday to get down to the 53-man limit.

<HEADLINE> Nelson: Farm Aid Is About Awareness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- Willie Nelson knew the Farm Aid concerts he  
helped start in 1985 wouldn't single-handedly erase the plight of 
farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We knew we couldn't raise the billions of dollars it would  
take to bail out the farmers,'' Nelson said. ``We did it to raise 
awareness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As the troubles continue, so do the shows. Farm Aid '99, set for  
Sept. 12 at the Nissan Pavilion in drought-stricken northern 
Virginia, will feature Trisha Yearwood, Deana Carter, The Dave 
Matthews Band and Barenaked Ladies. 
</P>
<P>
	Nelson said Thursday he continues to meet farmers who tell him  
their farms have been gobbled up by consolidation. And he doesn't 
like what he says the change has done to the taste of vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
	``I see the changes... in the restaurant where I like to eat --  
where I used to get good tomatoes,'' Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
	John Mellencamp, who joined with Nelson to hold the first Farm  
Aid in Champaign, Ill., said he admires the benefit for its staying 
power. 
</P>
<P>
	``So many of the 'aids' I was asked to participate in -- and did  
participate in the '70s and '80s -- were just sort of a moment 
thing,'' Mellencamp said. ``Willie has shown and the organization 
has shown that they're in it for the long haul. It's not a media 
stunt.''

<HEADLINE> Workers Demand More for Labor Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- The economy is booming, unemployment is low and  
union demands are high. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of workers are marking the Labor Day weekend on  
strike, while others are thinking about walking a picket line. 
Labor experts say unions are growing more aggressive and more 
willing to walk out in an effort to win back concessions from past 
contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	The experts say it is a byproduct of nine straight years of  
economic growth and a string of high-profile strikes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Employers are having a hard time finding enough employees, so  
this is an opportune time to push up wages in the trenches,'' said 
Peter Feuille, head of the University of Illinois' Institute for 
Labor and Industrial Relations. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the Boeing contract, reached this week, was an example  
of unions taking advantage of the booming economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can be an example to the labor movement,'' Bill Johnson,  
president of Aerospace Machinists Industrial District Lodge 751 in 
Seattle, said Wednesday after his union approved the Boeing 
contract. ``You can take on a major corporation and be 
successful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Boeing machinists had struck twice during the previous three  
negotiations, including a 69-day walkout in 1995, and appeared to 
be ready to walk out this year. Instead, the 44,000-member union 
overwhelmingly voted to approve the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The contract offers two annual wage increases of 4 percent and a  
third-year 3 percent raise, as well as a 10 percent signing bonus 
worth $4,400 to the average machinist. In addition, Boeing dropped 
demands for a seven-day work week and more worker contributions to 
health-insurance premiums. 
</P>
<P>
	But other recent contracts agreed to by union leaders have been  
rejected by members who want better deals. 
</P>
<P>
	About 6,100 of 11,000 Northwest Airlines flight attendants voted  
last week to reject a proposal that would have raised their average 
pay by 14 percent. And this week, about 9,200 teachers for Detroit 
public schools went on strike, rejecting their leader's request for 
a contract extension. 
</P>
<P>
	One Northwest flight attendant who campaigned against the  
contract said his colleagues wanted to break a pattern of 
concessions to the company. Attendants took pay cuts for three 
years beginning in 1993 to help keep Northwest out of bankruptcy, 
and wages are now only 3 percent higher than before the cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	``All kinds of things have evolved to make this a position we've  
never been in before,'' said Andy Damis of Seattle. ``We've got a 
tight job market and the pilots went on strike last year, so we 
think Northwest is really reluctant to go through that again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The strike last fall by 6,200 Northwest pilots was part of an  
overall increase in work stoppages, including strikes and lockouts. 
The U.S. Department of Labor said there were 34 major stoppages, 
each involving 1,000 workers or more, that affected 387,000 workers 
last year. That's up from 29 major strikes in 1997 that idled 
339,000 workers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The work force can look back at a time where they gave  
concessions or took profit sharing,'' said John Revitte, a 
professor at the Michigan State University School of Labor and 
Industrial Relations. ``Meanwhile, in the last couple of years 
they've seen incredible CEO compensation packages and mergers. In 
some of those instances, the work force says it's our turn.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's not clear how such concerns might affect negotiations  
between the United Auto Workers and U.S. automakers that cover 
407,000 workers. The contract between the UAW and General Motors 
Corp., Ford Motor Co. and DaimlerChrysler AG expires Sept. 14. 
</P>
<P>
	The union, which has released no information about the progress  
of the talks, hasn't held a national strike during negotiations 
since 1976. It has used plant-level strikes as a bargaining tool, 
though, the last in 1996 against GM during the last national 
negotiation. 
</P>
<P>
	But Feuille said labor actions now are much less frequent than  
in the 1950s, '60s and '70s, where no year had fewer than 200 major 
work stoppages. 
</P>
<P>
	``There may be a few situations where unions are willing to  
strike more than in the last 10 years,'' he said. ``But unions have 
realized the strike is a weapon that can play more into the 
employer's hands.''

<HEADLINE> MDs Give Prostate Patients Hope </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- One of men's greatest fears about prostate  
cancer surgery is that it will leave them impotent. Now Texas 
surgeons hunting a solution have successfully transplanted a nerve 
from men's legs into the pelvic area to restore erectile function. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, only a very small number of men have received this  
experimental nerve graft during prostate cancer surgery. But enough 
are regaining erectile function that the doctors told The 
Associated Press the early results signal an important advance. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is no question but that it's an exciting therapy and it's  
going to become very widespread,'' said Dr. Rahul Nath, a nerve 
specialist at Baylor College of Medicine who meticulously stitches 
the new nerve into place. 
</P>
<P>
	Many urologists were openly skeptical -- some laughed -- when  
surgeons from Baylor and M.D. Anderson Cancer Center told medical 
meetings they were going to try the procedure. 
</P>
<P>
	``People thought this was the most ridiculous thing they'd ever  
heard of,'' recalled M.D. Anderson urologist Dr. Christopher G. 
Wood. ``You could come up with a million explanations for why this 
shouldn't work -- but if it does work, who cares?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Surgery to remove the walnut-sized prostate gland can damage the  
delicate cavernous nerves, tiny nerves that nestle on either side 
of the prostate and are vital for erectile function. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nerve-sparing surgery,'' developed at Johns Hopkins  
University, has helped many men avoid impotency after prostate 
surgery. But nerve-sparing surgery doesn't always work -- there's a 
30 percent to 60 percent chance of erections afterwards, depending 
on the surgeon's skill and the extent of the cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Some men must have both cavernous nerves removed for their best  
chance at getting rid of all the cancer, leaving them with no 
erectile function. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you have to remove a nerve, why don't you just put another  
one in?'' Baylor urologist Dr. Edward Kim suggested. 
</P>
<P>
	After all, plastic surgeons have successfully transplanted other  
nerves, muscle or sensory nerves mostly in the face and arms. While 
one previous attempt in prostate cancer patients failed, 
microsurgical techniques have recently improved and scientists have 
restored erectile function in experiments with rats. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, the Texas urologists are offering nerve grafts as the last  
step in prostate surgery for certain men who need both cavernous 
nerves removed -- those who have no chance of sexual function 
without it. (The procedure cannot help men who already completed 
surgery.) 
</P>
<P>
	When those nerves are cut out, stumps of nerve fibers connecting  
to the penis, and stumps of fibers running back to the spinal cord, 
are left behind. The necessary nerve signals to cause an erection 
can't jump the gap between the two stumps. 
</P>
<P>
	That's where plastic surgeons step in. They remove a piece of a  
sensory nerve called the sural nerve from the back of the patient's 
ankle, leaving a numb spot slightly larger than a half-dollar on 
the man's foot. 
</P>
<P>
	They carefully sew the sural nerve piece onto each end of the  
nerve stumps, creating a bridge between the nerve fibers. 
</P>
<P>
	Without this nourishing bridge, nerve fibers leading to the  
penis would immediately shrivel and die. But in the Texas study, 
the original nerve fibers are regrowing over the transplanted nerve 
until eventually both ends reconnect, Kim and Wood explained. 
</P>
<P>
	It grows very slowly -- most men won't know until 14-18 months  
after surgery if they'll regain erectile function, the doctors 
cautioned. And to regain function, men also require months of 
physical therapy. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the 14 patients operated on long enough ago to start  
measuring the surgery's success, four now have sexual intercourse. 
Seven more have partial erections, not quite strong enough for 
intercourse. The impotence pill Viagra helps some of those men have 
sex, but Kim said it's too soon to tell if their nerve function 
will continue improving so they won't need sexual help. 
</P>
<P>
	With their cavernous nerves gone, none of the men should have  
erectile function unless the nerve graft really is working. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the first human regeneration of a ``parasynthetic nerve,''  
a particularly complex type of nerve that helps control various 
organs, Nath said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't tell you the number of times I've sat in front of  
these poor guys and you can just see it in their eyes -- the anxiety 
because they're saying to themselves, 'I'm trading my life for my 
sex life,''' Wood said. ``This offers them an opportunity to 
maximize cancer control and a relatively good chance at preserving 
potency.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although the Texas doctors' results haven't yet been evaluated  
by other scientists -- Kim will present early results at an 
impotence meeting in Boston in October -- some urologists are 
intrigued. 
</P>
<P>
	Physiologically, there's no reason a nerve graft couldn't work,  
said Dr. David G. McLeod, chief of urologic oncology at Walter Reed 
Army Medical Center, who has discussed the experiment with one of 
its inventors. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll be looking into it,'' McLeod said. ``I greet it with  
interest, not skepticism.''

<HEADLINE> Michigan Celebration Over the Top </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) -- Michigan still has the same old  
quarterback controversy. 
</P>
<P>
	College football, though, has popped the cork on a brand new  
one. And it's a beauty, considering how boisterous campuses are 
already. This latest controversy is about deciding when a 
celebration really goes over the top. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wolverines beat Notre Dame 26-22 Saturday, when the clock  
ran out on a final Irish drive at the Michigan 12-yard line. No 
controversy there. 
</P>
<P>
	No, to find the argument in this one, you have to rewind the  
videotape. 
</P>
<P>
	Back before the 2-yard touchdown run by Michigan's Anthony  
Thomas with 1:38 left that provided the final score (he was 
apparently too tired to celebrate). Back before the late hit out of 
bounds by Notre Dame's Ron Israel on Michigan's final drive turned 
what should have been a 15-yard Michigan gain into a something more 
than twice that long. There was no controversy there, either (the 
hit was late and definitely out of bounds). 
</P>
<P>
	No.  
</P>
<P>
	To get to the heart of this one, you have to go back to the 4:08  
mark, when Notre Dame's Bobby Brown caught a 2-point conversion 
pass in the right corner of the Michigan end zone, jumped to his 
feet ... and celebrated EXCESSIVELY. 
</P>
<P>
	And as best as anybody can tell, the entire excessive part came  
down to this: Brown stuck both his thumbs deep into the ear holes 
of his helmet, and facing the crowd, went ``Na-na-na-NA-na.'' He 
looked like someone imitating a moose with wriggling antlers. 
</P>
<P>
	You can't go past a playground today without seeing the same  
gesture being traded back and forth a dozen times. This one took 
place in the overheated cauldron of the Big House, as Michigan 
Stadium is called, on a 90-degree day near the end of a game in one 
of the most storied and passionate rivalries college football has 
to offer. At the moment Brown caught the ball, there were 111,523 
fans looking on -- most of them wildly partisan Wolverine fans. 
</P>
<P>
	And because he got up and imitated a moose for an instant, he's  
the one guilty of taunting? Apparently so, because Notre Dame got 
slapped with a 15-yard penalty that was tacked onto the ensuing 
kickoff. 
</P>
<P>
	The rule book expressly prohibits a player, after scoring, from  
turning to face the crowd. There were similar penalties called 
against Baylor and Boston College after touchdowns in another game 
Saturday. Both were assessed 15-yard penalties and both missed the 
ensuing extra point. Boston College won 30-29 in overtime when 
Baylor missed a second extra point. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, those 15 yards assessed against Notre Dame obviously didn't  
decide the game against Michigan. Not all by themselves. But when 
the Irish kicked from their own 20 to Thomas, who was moved into 
the middle of the return formation, he returned it 20 yards to the 
Michigan 42. That meant the Irish defense had to start its last 
stand with the almost half the field already conquered. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was all about about coaching and all I can say is that  
sort of thing won't happen again,'' Notre Dame coach Bob Davie 
said, offering to absorb as much blame as he could. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not blaming Bobby. I blame myself. We can't have silly  
mistakes like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davie's right, of course, but only about the late hit, and maybe  
his own decision, on the ill-fated kickoff, to have the ball 
drilled to Thomas right down the middle of the Michigan return 
formation. 
</P>
<P>
	Even sillier, though, is the celebration rule itself.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was just something personal,'' said Brown, a senior. ``I  
thought because I did it quick, he (the official) wouldn't see it. 
It was pure excitement. I've been around here too long for the 
coaches to question me about being a hot dog.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe so, maybe not. Offensive coordinator Kevin Rogers was  
red-faced afterward and Davie, given several chances to hang his 
player out to dry, passed on them. 
</P>
<P>
	``I take responsibility for that,'' Davie said. ``It was a  
matter of coaching. We have to coach better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Or lobby more effectively to change the rule.  
</P>
<P>
	An excessive celebration is what Jerry Pate did when he won  
golf's TPC championship in 1982, pushing then-commissioner Deane 
Beman and course architect Pete Dye into a lake ahead of him and 
then jumping in. 
</P>
<P>
	An excessive celebration is what 1,500-meter runner Gabriella  
Dorio found waiting when she finished her event at the 1984 
Olympics and returned home to be bathed in wine by her husband. 
</P>
<P>
	What Brown did Saturday wasn't excessive. But by helping  
Michigan win its season opener, he certainly contributed to some 
partying that would be by the time Saturday night rolled around. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Dennis Spawns Tornado in Va. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAMPTON, Va. (AP) -- A tornado packing winds up to 120 mph  
damaged an assisted living center, a nursing home and five 
apartment complexes on Saturday, injuring more than a dozen people 
and displacing as many as 1,000, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of residents of the Devonshire assisted-living center  
and the Wyndham, Township and Signature Way apartment complexes 
were evacuated in Hampton school buses to Red Cross shelters in 
nearby Ivy Memorial Baptist Church and Eaton Middle School. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 100 Devonshire residents later were transferred to  
Mayfair House, another assisted living center in Hampton. 
</P>
<P>
	Sandie Farrow, assistant administrator of the Devonshire home,  
said five residents were in the dining room when the tornado hit. 
They were cut by flying glass and taken to a hospital for 
treatment. The dining room was destroyed, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Twelve people with minor injuries were treated and released at  
Sentara Hampton General Hospital, a spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Frances Taycsik, 89, who has lived at Devonshire for four years,  
said she was talking on the phone when the tornado struck. ``... 
All of a sudden the windows opened and all we heard was a loud 
whish-bang. The girl on the phone said, `What was that?' I said, `I 
don't know but we better hang up.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The twister left up to 1,000 apartment residents without  
shelter. 
</P>
<P>
	Another tornado earlier damaged a barn and snapped utility polls  
in nearby Chesapeake, said Capt. Steve Johnson of the city's fire 
department. No one was injured, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	NWS forecaster Tim Armstrong said the tornadic winds were  
spawned by Tropical Storm Dennis, which had hovered off the North 
Carolina coast for a week before blowing shore late Saturday 
afternoon.

<HEADLINE> Mosquito Disease in New York City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- An outbreak of St. Louis encephalitis, a viral  
infection transmitted by mosquitos, has been blamed for at least 
one death here and could be responsible for several illnesses over 
the last two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	It is believed to be the first time the infection, usually found  
in the South, has spread to New York City. Workers have started 
spraying affected areas of the borough of Queens to prevent further 
outbreaks. 
</P>
<P>
	The viral infection is transmitted by a species of mosquito, and  
most people recover from it. But it can be fatal to those with 
weakened immune systems, such as the elderly, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Encephalitis symptoms usually manifest five to 15 days after a  
bite from a carrier mosquito. They can be as minor as a slight 
fever or headache, but some experience muscle weakness or paralysis 
that can trigger permanent neurological damage or death. 
</P>
<P>
	In the area where the outbreak occurred, residents were advised  
to wear insect repellent and to cover themselves while outside. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides a confirmed encephalitis death of an 80-year-old man on  
Tuesday, officials believe the infection may also be responsible 
for the death of an 87-year-old woman on Wednesday, said Dr. Annie 
Fine of the city's Department of Health. 
</P>
<P>
	Two middle-age men are being treated for the virus, and 20 other  
people may be infected, officials said.

<HEADLINE> West's Biggest Blaze Rages in Calif </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BIG BEAR LAKE, Calif. (AP) -- Brent Smyth has spent the last few  
days battling a 63,375-acre blaze in the rugged San Bernadino 
Mountains -- a gritty job of hacking and shoveling that could be 
undone by a breeze. 
</P>
<P>
	But Smyth isn't complaining -- he actually seems to enjoy the  
arduous task. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of outdoor enthusiasts are drawn to this type of work,''  
said the 21-year-old, who has been fighting fires around the 
country nonstop since April. ``You have to love camping in the 
woods and hiking all day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smyth is one of 2,100 firefighters from across the country drawn  
to this popular resort town to fight the blaze, which began Aug. 28 
and is now 70 percent contained. One firefighter suffered a minor 
injuries Friday, bringing the total injured to 10. The tab for 
fighting the blaze has topped $8.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	By the end of Friday, firefighters had made 63 miles of fire  
line, with about seven miles to go before the blaze would be 
surrounded. The so-called Willow fire was one of seven large fires 
burning in California. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the other wildfires burning out West are contained.  
</P>
<P>
	Residents of near the region 90 miles east of Los Angeles were  
depending on firefighters to keep flames away from towns through 
the lucrative Labor Day weekend. Wind on Friday swept smoke into 
Big Bear, where some people covered their faces with bandanas to 
protect against ash. 
</P>
<P>
	Crews have turned a ski resort into a mini-city by making it  
their headquarters. Hundreds of silver-colored dome tents dotted 
the grass-covered ski slopes while, inside the resort, fire 
officials labored over logistics. 
</P>
<P>
	By day, crews shovel dirt and chop away at smoldering tree  
trunks, pausing to pick soot from their teeth and wipe sweat from 
their brows. At night, they wait in long lines for food, then crawl 
into sleeping bags and shiver in 30-degree temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
	Ground crews work ahead of wildfires, clearing areas with  
bulldozers or by hand, burning off the adjacent vegetation and then 
repeating the process. If the wildfire crosses the line, the crew 
has to start all over. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fire gets the old adrenaline going,'' said Mike Witte, 38, a  
Bureau of Land Management bulldozer operator from Medford, Ore. 
``You get done with the day and you feel like you've done 
something, like you've accomplished something.''

<HEADLINE> Money Manager Martin Frankel Nabbed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) -- Missing money manager Martin Frankel,  
accused of embezzling millions of dollars to fund his reclusive yet 
luxurious lifestyle, was arrested Saturday in Germany 
</P>
<P>
	``You got me,'' Frankel said as the FBI and German police  
arrested him at the upscale Hotel Prem in Hamburg, Germany,'' FBI 
Special Agent Michael Wolf said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The arrest ended an international manhunt that lasted more than  
four months. It could be two to three months before Frankel is 
extradited to Connecticut, Wolf said. 
</P>
<P>
	Frankel, 44, was apprehended without incident and charged with  
money laundering and wire fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	``As we were limiting his assets in various accounts and as we  
were following leads, I think he expected sooner or later that he 
would be apprehended,'' Wolf said. 
</P>
<P>
	Seized from his room were a computer and its contents and an  
undetermined amount of cash and diamonds, Wolf said. He could not 
say whether Frankel had been trading from his room. 
</P>
<P>
	Also taken into custody was a 35-year-old U.S. citizen, Cynthia  
Allison, who was using the alias Susan Kelly, Wolf said. He did not 
elaborate on Allison's relationship to Frankel. She was detained 
for questioning, but has not been charged. 
</P>
<P>
	Frankel's New Haven lawyer, Hugh Keefe, said he has spoken to  
Frankel in the past 48 hours, but not since his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	Keefe would not say whether his client would fight extradition.  
He would not give details on their conversations or say whether 
Frankel knew authorities were closing in. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you're the object of that large a manhunt, I think you'd  
expect that you'd be apprehended,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities in the United States issued an arrest warrant for  
Frankel on July 14. He has been missing since May 5, when a fire 
alarm alerted firefighters to an emergency at his mansion in 
Greenwich. They found a blazing file cabinet and two fireplaces 
stuffed with burning documents. 
</P>
<P>
	Insurance company regulators said Frankel's unlicensed brokerage  
-- apparently run out of the $3 million Greenwich mansion -- had 
siphoned money several insurance companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Six were in the South -- three in Mississippi, and one each in  
Arkansas, Tennessee and Oklahoma -- and one was in a Southern border 
state, Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
	Regulators say Frankel stole at least $218 million from the  
insurers, but a lawsuit filed by some of the companies puts the 
loss at $915 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Frankel allegedly controlled Thunor Trust, set up in 1991 by  
businessman John Hackney to buy small, struggling insurance 
companies. Through his lawyer, Hackney has denied any wrongdoing 
and said he is a victim of Frankel. 
</P>
<P>
	Those insurance companies believed their policyholder money was  
being invested through Frankel's brokerage firm, Liberty National 
Securities. But apparently, no trades were ever made. Instead, 
prosecutors say Frankel stole the money. 
</P>
<P>
	Also missing is as much as $1.98 billion from the St. Francis of  
Assisi Foundation, which investigators say was established by 
Frankel in the British Virgin Islands last August. 
</P>
<P>
	Wolf would not disclose details about how authorities found  
Frankel, saying only that a tip was the key. Frankel was believed 
to have lived in Italy earlier this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Frankel may have been financing his run with more than $10  
million in diamonds and gold he bought before disappearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Law enforcement officials have said Frankel used several aliases  
after being barred from trading by the Securities and Exchange 
Commission in 1992, including David Rosse, the name of his personal 
bodyguard. 
</P>
<P>
	Frankel has been described by some investors as the Hugh Hefner  
of high finance, keeping a live-in retinue of young women he met 
through personal ads. 
</P>
<P>
	Frankel has described some of them as ``ex-girlfriends,'' but it  
isn't clear how many of the women he had sexual relationships with. 
At least some of the women performed office work at Frankel's 
unlicensed securities brokerage. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors say Frankel was gangly and neurotic, but offered an  
impressive biography and dedication, and that charmed them into 
trusting him with their money.

<HEADLINE> Giants' Brown Out 3-4 Weeks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Cancer survivor LeShon Johnson and  
rookie Sean Bennett will probably share the load at halfback for 
the New York Giants with Gary Brown expected to be sidelined 
through opening month of the season with a sprained left knee. 
</P>
<P>
	An MRI on Brown's knee showed a Grade 2 sprain of the medial  
collateral ligament, coach Jim Fassel said Saturday in a conference 
call. There was no cartilage damage and no surgery will be 
necessary, he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown, the Giants' leading rusher last season with 1,063 yards,  
was hurt early in the first quarter of Friday's preseason finale 
against Baltimore. He will begin rehabilitation immediately, but 
Fassel's best estimate was that it would take three to four weeks 
until he is ready to play. 
</P>
<P>
	The Giants open the regular season next Sunday at Tampa Bay.  
</P>
<P>
	``I have a lot of confidence in LeShon Johnson and Sean  
Bennett,'' Fassel said. ``Regardless of who starts, both will 
play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Johnson, who missed all of last season fighting  
lymphoma, nor Bennett, a fourth-round draft pick out of 
Northwestern, has Brown's ability to run inside. 
</P>
<P>
	The 227-pound Brown did not practice for the first two weeks of  
training camp because of a buttocks injury sustained in a 
motorcycle accident in late June. 
</P>
<P>
	However, he was starting to show signs of rounding into shape.  
</P>
<P>
	Fassel has concerns about Johnson and Bennett.  
</P>
<P>
	Johnson tore a ligament in his right thumb early in training  
camp and had to have surgery to fix it. He still wears a small cast 
on the thumb, and there have been times when he has had problems 
holding on to the ball. 
</P>
<P>
	He lost a fumble in the Giants' 28-24 last-second loss to the  
Ravens. Ironically, the officials correctly ruled that Johnson's 
fumble was caused by the ground, but the play was reviewed and the 
officials blew that call. 
</P>
<P>
	While Bennett has looked very good running outside tackles and  
scoring on two screen passes, he has been tentative running inside. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think you take a veteran out, a 1,000-yard rusher, and  
say it won't have an effect,'' Fassel said. ``However, and I know 
it was the preseason, I thought we functioned pretty well in the 
first couple of games with those guys playing. Sean Bennett started 
one of those games. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think both of those guys functioned well,'' Fassel said.  
``There is no reason to have despair. I think those guys can play 
well and I have confidence in them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Giants only averaged 3.0 yards in the preseason and Fassel  
plans to spend a lot of time working on that this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel really bad for Gary,'' said Johnson, who was undergoing  
chemotherapy when the regular season started last year. ``We were 
just talking on the sideline the other day and he was saying that 
he was starting to feel it again. The guy can't catch a break, but 
thank God he has a chance to come back in a couple of weeks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fassel spent much of Saturday making personnel decisions. He has  
to cut 19 players by Sunday and he said that job was 90 percent 
done by 5 p.m. Saturday afternoon, although he refused to disclose 
the names of any players cut. 
</P>
<P>
	Fassel plans to look at the waiver wire over the next two days  
in hopes of finding someone to help the team. However, he said he 
is not interested in signing another running back.

<HEADLINE> Sen.'s Aide Alleges Sex Harassment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HELENA, Mont. (AP) -- Sen. Max Baucus' top aide is accusing him  
of firing her after she confronted him over repeated sexual 
advances to her over the past 15 months. Baucus denied the 
allegations in a statement Friday, calling them ``frivolous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The accusation was made by Baucus' chief of staff, Christine  
Niedermeier, through her attorney, Elaine Charlson Bredehoft, who 
told The Associated Press in a telephone interview her client was 
``a victim of sexual harassment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bredehoft said Baucus had U.S. Capitol police officers stop  
Niedermeier from removing personal items from her office, including 
e-mail messages she claims will support the accusations against the 
senator. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was victim of being terminated when she said no, when she  
had a right to do that,'' Bredehoft said. Although Baucus never 
touched Niedermeier, he was ``commenting frequently on her 
appearance and suggesting things they could do together; go away 
for a weekend together,'' Bredehoft added. 
</P>
<P>
	Jean Manning, the Senate's chief counsel on employment issues,  
told the AP that Baucus informed Niedermeier last month he planned 
to fire her because most of his staff had threatened to resign over 
her ``intolerable management style.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He had 36 people in the office threatening to quit,'' said  
Manning, who represents senators in employment disputes. ``He tried 
to take appropriate action which was to terminate the cause of the 
problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Manning accused Niedermeier of concocting the sexual harassment  
claim in an effort to discourage Baucus from firing her. ``This was 
made up after the fact,'' Manning said, adding that Niedermeier has 
been on leave but would be terminated next Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Lombardi, a spokesman for Baucus, said the senator would  
not talk with reporters about Niedermeier's charges. 
</P>
<P>
	But in a prepared statement issued by his offices here and in  
Washington, Baucus said Niedermeier's allegations ``have absolutely 
no basis in fact.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Prior to making these allegations, I suggested to her that she  
seek new employment,'' Baucus said in the statement. ``I regret 
that her response has been to assert these frivolous charges 
against me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bredehoft said Niedermeier, 47 and single, has never had a  
sexual relationship with Baucus, 52 and married. 
</P>
<P>
	Niedermeier, who has been Baucus' staff chief since May 1998,  
did not confront him with her complaint until last month, Bredehoft 
told Roll Call, a Capitol Hill newspaper, which first published the 
story Friday on its Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	Bredehoft said her client hasn't decided yet whether to file a  
formal sexual harassment complaint against Baucus.

<HEADLINE>  Braves' Galarraga Back With the Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The uniform fits a bit more snugly on Andres  
Galarraga than it did before. The smile hasn't changed a bit. 
</P>
<P>
	Cured of cancer and back in the Atlanta Braves dugout for the  
first time this season, the Big Cat provided a dose of inspiration 
for baseball's hottest team, even though it wasn't really needed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves won for the 13th time in 14 games with a 7-3 victory  
over the Arizona Diamondbacks, extending Atlanta's lead in the NL 
East to 4 1/2 games over the New York Mets. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevin Millwood allowed only one hit through seven innings and  
had a two-run single, Andruw Jones homered and made another 
spectacular catch, and Ryan Klesko hit the longest homer by an 
Atlanta player in the three-year history of Turner Field. 
</P>
<P>
	But this night belonged to Galarraga, who couldn't stop smiling  
as he hung out with his teammates during batting practice. The most 
emotional moment came shortly before the game, when he accompanied 
coach Pat Corrales to bring out the lineup card and received a 
standing ovation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I almost started crying,'' said Galarraga, who has gained  
about 25 pounds during his layoff but also has regained the 
black-and-gray hair which fell out during chemotherapy. 
</P>
<P>
	After the game, fellow Venezuelan Eddie Perez playfully wrestled  
with Galarraga near first after they shook hands with the players 
coming off the field. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to touch my base, and he didn't want me to,''  
Galarraga said, breaking into a grin once again. ``I touched it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves touched plenty of bases, while Millwood (15-7) shut  
out the Diamondbacks on one hit through seven innings. 
</P>
<P>
	The right-hander has been on a sensational streak, allowing just  
15 hits in 41 innings in his last five starts. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know what it is,'' Millwood said. ``I'm making some  
good pitches, the guys are playing really good defense behind me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No one has played better defense than Jones, who robbed Jay Bell  
of his 33rd homer with another Gold Glove-type catch in the first. 
</P>
<P>
	Running at full speed toward the wall in left-center, Jones  
timed his leap perfectly and snared the ball with his left arm 
extended a couple of feet above the yellow line. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I should catch everything that comes my way,'' Jones  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Galarraga, the Braves' leading hitter last year with 44 homers  
and 121 RBIs, has missed the entire season while undergoing cancer 
treatment. But, with doctors saying his illness is cured, he plans 
to spend the rest of the season providing moral support to his 
teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't replace that smile. You can't replace that attitude.  
You can't replace that personality,'' Chipper Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though Galarraga returned to the Atlanta dugout, the Braves  
still have his No. 14 written on their caps, as they have all 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``He looks good,'' Walt Weiss said. ``His spirits are high. They  
always are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Galarraga remained home in West Palm Beach, Fla., while  
undergoing treatment. His physician, Dr. Luis Barreras, said the 
cancerous tumor, discovered in Galarraga's back on Feb. 18, has 
completely disappeared after four months of chemotherapy, followed 
by radiation treatments. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like a little kid again,'' Galarraga said. ``I couldn't  
wait 'til the day came when I could put my uniform on and get back 
with my team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Millwood retired the first nine hitters before Bell broke up the  
no-hitter with a fourth-inning single. 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves scored four runs in the fourth, getting back-to-back  
homers from Klesko and Andruw Jones, then turned the game into a 
rout with a three-run fifth. 
</P>
<P>
	Klesko's homer was a 441-foot shot into the Atlanta bullpen,  
eclipsing a 438-foot drive by Chipper Jones last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona lost its third in a row, reducing its NL West lead to  
five games over second-place San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	``The way (the Braves are) going, they're going to be hard to  
beat,'' Arizona manager Buck Showalter said. ``You have to be on 
top of your game, and we weren't today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Through the seventh, Millwood was actually outhitting the entire  
Arizona team, following up a third-inning single with a 
fifth-inning hit that brought home two runs. 
</P>
<P>
	In the eighth, Arizona finally put together four singles,  
breaking up the shutout with a run-scoring hit by Hanley Frias. But 
Millwood, who struck out 10 and walked none, got out of a 
bases-loaded, one-out jam. 
</P>
<P>
	Damion Miller hit a two-run single off Kevin McGlinchy in the  
ninth. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona starter Armando Reynoso (10-3) was pounded for eight  
hits and four runs in 3 2-3 innings, which shouldn't have been 
surprising. His career record against the Braves, his original 
team, dropped to 0-8. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was throwing some pitches too high,'' Reynoso said. ``You  
can't do that at this level.'' 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* Klesko's homer was only the fourth longest at the Ted  
overall. Chicago's Sammy Sosa has the two longest homers, led by a 
444-foot drive last season. ... After going 20-8 in August, the 
Diamondbacks are 0-2 in September. ... Luis Gonzalez went 0-for-3, 
ending his 16-game hitting streak. The Arizona outfielder has four 
double-figure hitting streaks this season, highlighted by a 
30-gamer.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Fed Cup Team Chosen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Wimbledon and U.S. Open champion Lindsay  
Davenport was among four of the top six-ranked women in the world 
who were selected Saturday for the U.S. Fed Cup team that will meet 
Russia in the final Sept.18-19 at Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. captain Billie Jean King also chose Monica Seles and the  
Williams sisters -- Venus and Serena. 
</P>
<P>
	``I couldn't be more pleased with the team that the United  
States will field for this Fed Cup final,'' King said. ``The fact 
that the four highest-ranked women in the country have committed to 
play Fed Cup speaks highly about the state of the women's game in 
America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davenport is ranked second in the world, followed by No. 3 Venus  
Williams, No. 4 Seles and No. 6 Serena Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed Cup is the premier women's international team tennis  
competition, similar to the Davis Cup. The United States has won 
the Fed Cup 15 times since its inception in 1963, more than any 
other nation, and is 3-0 against Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States last defeated the Russians -- then part of the  
Soviet Union team -- in the 1990 Fed Cup final at Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	Next year, the Fed Cup will unveil a new format, with Italy and  
the Slovak Republic staging four-team round-robin events. 
</P>
<P>
	The new 13-nation World Group format addresses the diminishing  
player commitment due to the tennis calendar constraints and the 
limited time for promoting the matches. Under the new format, 12 
teams will be divided into three four-nation groups, with the 
winners advancing to a four-team competition hosted by this year's 
champion. 
</P>
<P>
	The competition also will be completed within two weeks, instead  
of the current three. And while the World Group consists of 13 
nations, only three teams will play more than one week. 
</P>
<P>
	As losing semifinalists in this year's competition, Italy and  
the Slovak Republic will be hosts to two of the three groups the 
week of April 24, 2000. The third group will play at the World 
Group final between Russia and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Joining Italy in Group A will be Spain, Germany and Croatia.  
Group B will include the Slovak Republic, Switzerland, Austria and 
the Czech Republic, while the loser later this month will be joined 
by France, Belgium and Australia. The first-round pairings were 
determined Saturday by a draw. 
</P>
<P>
	The winners of the three groups will then join the Russia-United  
States winner the week of Nov. 20, 2000, for the semifinals and 
final.

<HEADLINE> CART's Tracy, Andretti Talk Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- After a series of on-track  
run-ins, Paul Tracy and Michael Andretti appear to have settled 
their differences. 
</P>
<P>
	The CART FedEx Series drivers traded pointed comments two weeks  
ago after crashing while battling for third place early in the 
Target Grand Prix at Chicago Motor Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	The crash was costly to both drivers, putting them far behind  
series leader Juan Montoya and runner-up Dario Franchitti in the 
season points. 
</P>
<P>
	Tracy, who was barred from competing in the season-opening race  
at Homestead, Fla., because of hitting Andretti's car during last 
fall's race in Australia, decided it was time to talk with the 
former series champion. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've never spoken before,'' Tracy said. ``There have been  
some problems and we've had a lot of bad blood between us. I called 
him to see if we could talk it out. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told him I didn't call to get in an argument. He listened  
and we cleared the air. We agreed we both need to give each other 
enough room on the racetrack.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Andretti said, ``Basically, we just discussed the fact that we  
have to be able to both go into a corner together and come out of 
the corner together. It's not a question of giving in. It's just a 
question of giving each other space. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not asking him to let me by,'' he said. ``I'm just asking  
him to give me room, and I will do the same.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wally Dallenbach, CART's chief steward, had urged Tracy and  
Andretti to talk out their differences and was so happy with the 
results that he canceled a meeting with the drivers Friday. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *SUPER SUB:* Roberto Moreno appears ready to give up his ``Super  
Sub'' label. 
</P>
<P>
	The Brazilian has kept his open-wheel racing career going since  
the beginning of the 1998 season by filling in for injured drivers 
or taking part-time rides with struggling teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Moreno ran the first two races of last season for the  
underfunded Project Indy team, then sat out the rest of the year, 
except for filling in at Newman-Haas Racing for Christian 
Fittipaldi in Milwaukee after Fittipaldi sustained a concussion. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, Moreno drove two races, including the Indianapolis  
500, in the rival Indy Racing League, then returned to CART, 
filling in for eight races for injured Mark Blundell. 
</P>
<P>
	Blundell returned to the cockpit last month in Detroit, but  
Moreno filled in again for Fittipaldi, who was hurt in a testing 
accident. Fittipaldi is expected to return for the Houston race 
Sept. 26, again leaving Moreno without a ride. 
</P>
<P>
	``You go race by race and don't think that far down the road,''  
Moreno said. ``The other guys are thinking about the championship. 
I'm just thinking about getting a job for next year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moreno is in negotiations with an unidentified CART team and  
hopes to announce a full-time deal for 2000 after next Sunday's 
race at Monterey, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *TRIPLE THREAT:* The Player's Forsythe team will test three  
drivers before deciding on a replacement for Greg Moore, who is 
leaving for Marlboro Penske Racing next season. 
</P>
<P>
	Neil Micklewright, vice president of operations for Gerry  
Forsythe's team, said Canadian drivers Lee Bentham, Alexandre 
Tagliani and David Empringham will each have a two-day test on the 
road course at Sebring, Fla., later this month. 
</P>
<P>
	``The drivers are aware that this isn't a contest to find out  
who does the fastest lap,'' Micklewright said. ``They will be 
evaluated on such aspects as the consistency of their lap times, 
their ability to adapt to certain situations like entering and 
leaving the pit area, driving in a fuel-saving model, bringing 
tires to temperature, etc. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our game plan is that the drivers can get accustomed to the  
car on the first day, while the second day will be used to check on 
what kind of feedback we get from the drivers about how the car 
handles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Empringham was the Indy Lights champion in 1996, but has not  
raced in two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Bentham and Tagliani have been teammates on the Player's Formula  
Atlantic team for two seasons. Bentham won the driver's title last 
year, while Tagliani has six wins overall. 
</P>
<P>
	Forsythe's CART team also is currently in negotiations with  
Patrick Carpentier, Moore's teammate, for 2000.

<HEADLINE> Mutiny 5, Revolution 1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FOXBORO, Mass. (AP) -- Manuel Lagos scored the first two goals of  
his career and set up two more as the Tampa Bay Mutiny beat the New 
England Revolution 5-1 Saturday in Major League Soccer. 
</P>
<P>
	Tampa (13-14) extended its winning streak to four games.  
</P>
<P>
	Lagos' six points equaled a Mutiny single-game scoring high.  
</P>
<P>
	Raul Diaz Arce, Carlos Valderrama and Mauricio Ramos also scored  
for the Mutiny, who set a single-game mark for most goals. 
</P>
<P>
	Tampa Bay opened the scoring in the 15th minute when Lagos got  
past a sluggish Revolution defense before ripping a shot past New 
England goalkeeper Walter Zenga from eight yards. 
</P>
<P>
	The lone bright spot of the evening for the Revolution (9-17)  
came in the 17th minute, when Giovanni Savarese headed in an 
equalizer from six yards out. New England has won just once in its 
last 10. 
</P>
<P>
	Lagos got his second goal of the game at the 20-minute mark.  
Diaz Arce gave the Mutiny a 3-1 cushion with a goal in the 38th 
minute. 
</P>
<P>
	Valderrama scored his third goal of the season three minutes  
into the second half. Ramos rounded out the scoring as he scored 
off a pass from Lagos at 67 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	New England has won only one game since the All-Star break and  
is in the midst of a 1-8 slump. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday's game was the second half of a doubleheader that  
started with the U.S. women's soccer team beating Ireland 5-0. It 
was the first time the U.S. players competed together since their 
World Cup victory.

<HEADLINE>  Braves' Galarraga Back With the Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The uniform fits a bit more snugly on Andres  
Galarraga than it did before. The smile hasn't changed a bit. 
</P>
<P>
	Cured of cancer and back in the Atlanta Braves dugout for the  
first time this season, the Big Cat provided a dose of inspiration 
for baseball's hottest team, even though it wasn't really needed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves won for the 13th time in 14 games with a 7-3 victory  
over the Arizona Diamondbacks, extending Atlanta's lead in the NL 
East to 4 1/2 games over the New York Mets. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevin Millwood allowed only one hit through seven innings and  
had a two-run single, Andruw Jones homered and made another 
spectacular catch, and Ryan Klesko hit the longest homer by an 
Atlanta player in the three-year history of Turner Field. 
</P>
<P>
	But this night belonged to Galarraga, who couldn't stop smiling  
as he hung out with his teammates during batting practice. The most 
emotional moment came shortly before the game, when he accompanied 
coach Pat Corrales to bring out the lineup card and received a 
standing ovation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I almost started crying,'' said Galarraga, who has gained  
about 25 pounds during his layoff but also has regained the 
black-and-gray hair which fell out during chemotherapy. 
</P>
<P>
	After the game, fellow Venezuelan Eddie Perez playfully wrestled  
with Galarraga near first after they shook hands with the players 
coming off the field. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to touch my base, and he didn't want me to,''  
Galarraga said, breaking into a grin once again. ``I touched it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves touched plenty of bases, while Millwood (15-7) shut  
out the Diamondbacks on one hit through seven innings. 
</P>
<P>
	The right-hander has been on a sensational streak, allowing just  
15 hits in 41 innings in his last five starts. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know what it is,'' Millwood said. ``I'm making some  
good pitches, the guys are playing really good defense behind me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No one has played better defense than Jones, who robbed Jay Bell  
of his 33rd homer with another Gold Glove-type catch in the first. 
</P>
<P>
	Running at full speed toward the wall in left-center, Jones  
timed his leap perfectly and snared the ball with his left arm 
extended a couple of feet above the yellow line. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I should catch everything that comes my way,'' Jones  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Galarraga, the Braves' leading hitter last year with 44 homers  
and 121 RBIs, has missed the entire season while undergoing cancer 
treatment. But, with doctors saying his illness is cured, he plans 
to spend the rest of the season providing moral support to his 
teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't replace that smile. You can't replace that attitude.  
You can't replace that personality,'' Chipper Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though Galarraga returned to the Atlanta dugout, the Braves  
still have his No. 14 written on their caps, as they have all 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``He looks good,'' Walt Weiss said. ``His spirits are high. They  
always are.''

cancerous tumor, discovered in Galarraga's back on Feb. 18, has 
completely disappeared after four months of chemotherapy, followed

<HEADLINE> Rams Assistant Arrested for DWI </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- St. Louis Rams offensive line coach Jim Hanifan  
was arrested early Saturday for driving while intoxicated. 
</P>
<P>
	Hanifan was driving in St. Charles when he was pulled over on a  
routine traffic stop about 3 a.m. Saturday. After administering a 
field sobriety test, the arresting office took Hanifan into 
custody, said St. Charles Cpl. Ron Bextermueller. 
</P>
<P>
	Hanifan later took a blood-alcohol test. St. Charles police have  
not released the results of the test. The legal blood-alcohol limit 
in Missouri is 0.10. 
</P>
<P>
	Hanifan was also cited for two minor traffic violations. He was  
released from custody Saturday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	``As an organization, we are extremely disappointed,'' Rams  
president John Shaw said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	A Rams spokesman said head coach Dick Vermeil was aware of the  
situation. Hanifan will receive a medical evaluation, and the Rams 
said additional treatment or discipline will take into 
consideration the results of that evaluation. 
</P>
<P>
	Bextermueller said he was not aware of Hanifan's driving  
history. If the arrest was Hanifan's first, he likely could have it 
expunged from his record if he pleaded guilty and completed a 
court-ordered driving class. 
</P>
<P>
	Hanifan is entering his third season on the Rams coaching staff  
and his 27th in the NFL. He starting coaching 40 years ago, and was 
a high school head coach and college assistant before getting his 
first NFL job with the St. Louis Cardinals in 1973. He was the 
Cardinals' head coach from 1980 to 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	Hanifan has coached for five NFL teams, and was the offensive  
line coach when the Washington Redskins won the Super Bowl in 1991.
