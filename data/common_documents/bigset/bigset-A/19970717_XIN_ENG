<HEADLINE> Annan Submits UN Reform Plans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 16 (Xinhua) -- United Nations
Secretary-General Kofi Annan today submitted 90-page reform plans
for the world body.
</P>
<P>
The plans were worked out after more than six months of
consultations with member states. But some of the plans still need
to be approved by U.N. government bodies, such as the General
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Following are highlights of the reform plans:
</P>
<P>
-- DEVELOPMENT FUND: Make at least 200 million U.S. dollars
available for the biennium beginning 2002 for development
activities from savings obtained from the regular budget by
reducing administrative and other overhead costs in the U.N.
Secretariat;
</P>
<P>
-- DEPUTY: Create a Deputy U.N. Secretary-General post,
preferably a woman, to represent the Secretary-General in his
absence from Headquarters, and spearhead efforts to raise
financing for development. The Deputy Secretary-General will also
ensure the coherence of the organization's cross-sectoral
activities;
</P>
<P>
-- CABINET: Establish a cabinet-style structure that would
prevent 27 senior officials reporting directly to Annan. Instead
four managers would take charge of specific areas for peace and
security, humanitarian affairs, development and economic and
social issues. Another four or five managers, including a human
rights official, will join the group. Twelve entities in the main
bureaucracy would be merged into five;
</P>
<P>
-- AID AGENCIES: Six agencies are to be coordinated in two main
groups -- humanitarian affairs and development. But each agency
would maintain its identity. The aim is closer coordination to
make sure common facilities are developed in each country where
more than one agency operates;
</P>
<P>
-- DISARMAMENT: Create a new disarmament department integrating
existing programs and centers in New York to prevent the
proliferation of all types of weapons and control or monitor flow
of arms to conflict areas;
</P>
<P>
-- BUDGET: Propose a no-growth budget. This will be the first
time in a generation that there has been negative growth, in real
terms, in the United Nations budget. Eliminate 1,000 staff posts
and reduce administrative costs by 33 percent. These savings will
be reallocated to development;
</P>
<P>
-- GENERAL ASSEMBLY: The General Assembly will refocus its work
on issues of highest priority and reduce the length of its
sessions. Recommends the 185-nation body streamline its agenda of
165 items and set priorities for its various programs. Member
states should also reduce five intergovernmental bodies into two;
</P>
<P>
-- ALL AGENCIES: Recommend a commission made up of government
ministers for the year 2000 to look at the Byzantine system of
specialized agencies, ranging from semi-autonomous groups to those
completely independent of the Secretary-General, such as the World
Bank;
</P>
<P>
-- REVOLVING FUND: Help solve the cash flow problem by asking
for contributions from member countries for those nations, like
the United States, who are heavily in arrears. Interest would have
to be paid by the borrowers to the lenders.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to the special meeting of the U.N. General
Assembly on Reform today, Annan said that the reforms he was
proposing are "bold reforms."
</P>
<P>
"They are the most extensive and far-reaching reforms in the
fifty-two-year history of our organization," he stressed.

<HEADLINE> US Consumer Inflation Up Slowly in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The Consumer Price Index (CPI)
in the U.S. was up by a seasonally adjusted 0.1 percent in June,
the U.S. Labor Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
It was the same as every other month this year except February
when consumer prices increased 0.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
The report showed that the slow-moving of the U.S. CPI in the
month mainly resulted from the falling energy prices and stable
food prices.
</P>
<P>
In June, energy prices were unchanged following substantial
drops in March, April and May. For the first half of the year,
energy prices fell at an 8.9 percent annual rate after increasing
8.6 percent for all of 1996.
</P>
<P>
Food prices, which rose 0.2 percent in June, increased at just
a 0.9 percent annual rate for the first half after an increase of
4.3 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
U.S. consumer inflation for the first half of this year
increased just 1.4 percent, the best for any first half since
1986. It was markedly lower than the 3.3 percent price increase
for all of last year.
</P>
<P>
Excluding food and energy, the first-half inflation rate was
just 2.4 percent, comparing with a 2.6 percent rate for all of
last year. It was the best for the first six months of any year
since 1965.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that June's good inflation news would set the
stage for U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's
semiannual report to Congress next week. Some U.S. congressmen
have criticized Greenspan and his colleagues for raising interest
rates in March but have praised them for refraining from
increasing rates since.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Mutual Funds Assets Set Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Assets managed in Canadian mutual
funds surged to an all-time high of 188.6 billion U.S. dollars by
the end of June, said reports today.
</P>
<P>
In the first six months of this year, 23.8 billion dollars of
new money flowed into mutual funds, including reinvested
distributions.
</P>
<P>
Net sales for June alone were 2.7 billion dollars, making it
the best June ever, according to figures released by the
Investment Funds Institute of Canada.
</P>
<P>
Net sales for the first six months of the year jumped to 22.2
billion dollars from 15.2 billion dollars for the same period in
1996.
</P>
<P>
"I think the fund industry has a realistic shot at 220 billion
dollars by the end of the year," predicted Dan Richards, president
of Toronto-based consultant Marketing Solutions.
</P>
<P>
"For the first six months of this year, every month except
January was an all-time record," he added.
</P>
<P>
The surge of Canada's mutual funds assets were fueled by rising
stock markets and individuals seeking investment alternatives, the
reports said.
</P>
<P>
The low interest rates here are sending investors into the arms
of the fund industry.
</P>
<P>
"As money is coming due from guaranteed investment certificates
and people need to put it somewhere, mutual funds -- for many
people -- are becoming the only alternative," Richards was quoted
as saying.

<HEADLINE> DPRK, South Korean Troops Clash on MDL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Military forces of the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) and South Korea
clashed on the Military Demarcation Line (MDL) today, with both
sides accusing each other of serious provocation.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK's Korean Central News Agency pyongyang reported that
South Korean troops "fired recoilles guns and 12.7 mm
machine-guns, about 3,060 shells and bullets in all, at (the
DPRK's) people's army soldiers on routine patrol duty near the
military demarcation line in the central sector of the front this
morning."
</P>
<P>
"The firing left some of the people's army soldiers seriouly
injured and destroyed the outpost buildings," it said.
</P>
<P>
"The people's army soldiers were compelled to take self-
defensive measures under the grave situation. The two sides,
therefore, went into fierce armed conflict on the MDL," the news
agency said.
</P>
<P>
"The reckless armed provocation of the puppets is part of the
traitor kim young sam's deliberate and premeditated moves to find
a way out of the most serious ruling crisis in a shocking
incident," it added.
</P>
<P>
In Seoul, South Korean military officials said the DPRK's
forces fired artillery shells at a Southern guard post, in what
was one of the worst border clashes in recent years.
</P>
<P>
"We strongly warn that we will never tolerate any provocation
in the future," Lieutenant-General Joung Young-moo said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
Joung said the incident began when seven DPRK soldiers crossed
the MDL that runs through the middle of the four-km wide
Demilitarized Zone, which separates the Korean peninsula under a
truce agreement signed at the end of the 1950-53 Korean War.
</P>
<P>
South Korean troops fired shots in the air after broadcasting
warning messages on loudspeakers. DPRK forces responded with
about 80 rounds of rifle fire at two guard posts, which returned a
similar burst of fire.
</P>
<P>
Yeo Sook-dong, chief spokesman for South Korea's Joint Chiefs
of Staff, told reporters that DPRK forces then fired 10 artillery
rounds that landed near a DMZ guard post on the southern side.
</P>
<P>
South Korean troops responded with one round from a recoilless
rifle. The shooting lasted for less than an hour and ended just
before noon (0300 GMT) after the Southern side broadcast a
ceasefire proposal.
</P>
<P>
No southern casualties were reported in the incident.

<HEADLINE> Travel Between Canada, Other Countries Drops in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The number of overnight trips
between Canada and other countries dropped in May, Statistics
Canada reported today.
</P>
<P>
In May, Canadians spent at least one night out of the country
on almost 1.6 million occasions, down 2.8 percent from April.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, foreigners made 3.1 percent fewer trips to Canada
compared with April.
</P>
<P>
The number of foreign visitors to Canada has been on the rise
since mid-1992, the federal agency said.
</P>
<P>
In May, the number of trips of at least one night between
Canada and overseas countries (those other than the U.S.) fell by
6.4 percent in both directions.
</P>
<P>
This was the largest drop in travel in both directions since
February 1993 for overseas visitors to Canada and since December
1992 for Canadians to overseas destinations.
</P>
<P>
Overseas visitors made 359,000 trips of one or more nights to
Canada in May, the lowest monthly level since February 1996.
</P>
<P>
May was the third consecutive month that Canada received fewer
overseas visitors, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
The weakening of many European currencies and the Japanese yen
against the Canadian dollar during the past year partly explained
the drop of overseas visitors to Canada.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Inflation Slightly up for June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's monthly inflation rose
slightly to 21.4 percent in June, according to figures released
today by the Central Statistical Office.
</P>
<P>
Economists warned that Zimbabwe's economy is facing serious
inflationary pressures stemming from on-going wage and salary
negotiations and expected administered price increases. They
predicted the inflation would exceed 24 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Central Statistical Office said that prices rose on average
1.4 percent over the previous month.
</P>
<P>
But the economists warned that the figure could be higher
later in the year following July's wage and salary negotiations
which are likely to see awards of up to 40 percent for workers in
most sectors.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe has over the past few weeks witnessed an upsurge in
strikes as workers demand wages and salary increases of up to 40
percent which they argued, would restore an eroded purchasing
power.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Manufacturing Shipments Fall in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Canada's total manufacturing
shipments fell for the first time in 1997, edging down 0.2 percent
in May, Statistics Canada reported today.
</P>
<P>
The value of Canadian manufacturing shipments dropped 0.2
percent to 25.9 billion U.S. dollars in May.
</P>
<P>
"May's slight easing follows four consecutive increases, and
reflects both the influence of several moderate declines and the
absence of any strong increases," the federal agency said.
</P>
<P>
Overall, decreases were recorded in 13 of the 22 major industry
groups, which accounted for almost 51 percent of Canada's total
shipments.
</P>
<P>
The most significant decreases in May were recorded in the
primary metal (-2.6 percent) and the refined petroleum and coal
products (-3.4 percent) industries.
</P>
<P>
Yet, these decreases were partly offset by increases in the
motor vehicle (+2.1 percent) and the electrical and electronic
products (+1.7 percent) industries.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Canadian manufacturers secured a large
increase in their contracts for the third time this year, a
development that bodes well for future shipments.
</P>
<P>
Total unfilled orders shot up 2.4 percent in May to 27.8
billion dollars, as international demand for Canadian aircraft and
parts continued to grow.
</P>
<P>
In May, manufacturers' inventories rose 0.6 percent to 33.6
billion dollars, the fourth consecutive increase after small
declines in December and January.

<HEADLINE> France to Abandon Majority Stock Holding in Thomson CSF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The state will abandon the majority
stock holding in the Thomson CSF defense-electronics group after
completing its restructuring process, possibly by the end of the
year, said French Minister of Economy and Finance Dominique
Strauss-Kahn today.
</P>
<P>
The French state now holds 58 percent of the stocks of Thomson
CSF, and is looking for a French company to set up an ownership
alliance while selling the remaining part of the stocks.
</P>
<P>
"When one starts from 58 percent and wishes to reach an
alliance with a partner, it is difficult to remain above 50
percent (in stock holding)," Kahn told parliament.
</P>
<P>
The stock value of Thomson CSF fell by 3.6 percent Tuesday, the
first day of its trading after Prime Minister Lionel Jospin
announced the stop of the privatization process of the group last
weekend.
</P>
<P>
The French government said Tuesday that no decision was made on
who the government would ally with for the future running of
Thomson CSF, although the Alcatel Alsthom SA engineering group was
widely expected to be the one to be chosen.
</P>
<P>
Strauss-Kahn said that the state could maintain a 33 percent
ownership of the stocks, although other options are possible.
</P>
<P>
"Nothing is decided in this field. We will launch in the
coming weeks a new procedure and see with different players how
the state can reach its objective," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the government wishes to have a French
partner rather than a European one, a policy different from that
of former Prime Minister Alain Juppe.
</P>
<P>
The stock value of Thomson CSF has fallen by 13.7 percent since
May 26, the day after the leftist coalition led in the first round
of legislative elections.

<HEADLINE> Manila Revises Inflation Target Due to Peso Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government has
decided to raise its targeted inflation rate to 8 percent from the
previously-projected 5.2 to 5.7 percent, the governor of the
central bank said today.
</P>
<P>
Central bank chief Gabriel Singson was quoted by the local Sky
Cable television as saying that the inflation target was revised
due to a possible 10 percent price hike triggered by the
devaluation of the Philippine peso.
</P>
<P>
The inflation rate, which stood at 8.4 percent last year,
averaged a low 4.6 percent for the first six months of this year.
</P>
<P>
After the de facto depreciation of the peso last Friday, fears
of price hikes have swept the country. But a government task force
said today there was so far no hikes in prices of basic
commodities.
</P>
<P>
The National Power Corporation said today it will not raise its
power rates in at least two months. But businessmen from other
sectors, including oil and food industries, said they will have to
heave prices due to the sharp depreciation of the peso.
</P>
<P>
The exchange rate of the peso against the U.S. dollar has
depreciated more than 11 percent to 29.35 pesos against one dollar
today, compared to the 26.40 pesos before the central bank's
floatation of the peso last Friday.

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The German government today approved
the country's participation in the international Alpha Space
Station project, the largest one planned worldwide so far.
</P>
<P>
According to the government's decision, Germany would
contribute 2.5 billion marks (1.4 billion U.S. dollars) to the
project, announced German Research Minister Juergen Ruettgers
here today.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the station would be the central area of
German space activities over the coming years.
</P>
<P>
An international agreement on the Alpha Space Station, which is
being built by the United States, Russia, Japan, the European
Union (EU) and Canada, would be signed in autumn this year,
Ruettgers said.
</P>
<P>
The United States plans to bear half of the costs to build the
station, followed by Russia with a share of 30 percent, Japan with
8 percent, the EU with 5 percent and Canada with 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The station is intended for peaceful international space
research and scientific cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Britain Welcomes European Union's Agenda 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The British government expressed
here today its endorsement to the European Union (EU) executive
Commission's proposals of admitting new EU members, but urged more
radical farm spending cuts.
</P>
<P>
British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said in a statement issued
here today, "Today's launch by the European Commission of its
Agenda 2000 proposals opens a new chapter in the history of the
European Union."
</P>
<P>
"I welcome the fact that we are moving away from introspection
about our institutions to a new agenda based on the twin aims of
enlargement and policy reform," Cook said. "These are key
components in the new European agenda which the new British
government wants to advance."
</P>
<P>
On the EU's enlargement plan, Cook said, "Enlargement is a
central objective for the UK and the EU. We must grasp this
historical opportunity to enhance security and prosperity
throughout Europe."
</P>
<P>
"We look forward to opening the (entry) negotiations themselves
during the UK's presidency of the EU in the first half of 1998,"
Cook said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the proposals on the EU Common Agricultural Policy,
which takes a lion's share of the EU budget, Cook said that the
agriculture reform is "a top priority if enlargement is to be
affordable and successful. We want a competitive and viable
European agriculture, friendly to the consumer and the
environment."
</P>
<P>
The foreign secretary noted that although the proposals will
bring real benefits to consumers, the British government will need
a still more radical strategy.
</P>
<P>
"A cap on overall spending must increase the pressure to reduce
agriculture spending which at present takes half of the budget,"
he said.

<HEADLINE> Britain Promises Tough Action on Smuggled Beef </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The British government has promised
the European Union (EU) that it would take tough measures to crack
down on illegal beef exports, but repeated its warning of blocking
beef exports from other EU countries that failed to meet British
standards.
</P>
<P>
British Agriculture Minister Jack Cunningham was quoted by
local press reports as telling the European Parliament's BSE or
mad cow disease committee that "we are totally committed to the
principles of openness and transparency" in fighting against
illegal beef exports.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that some British beef, under the global trade
embargo, had been illegally exported to other countries,
triggering a new wave of hostility across Europe.
</P>
<P>
Cunningham said, "I'm determined to crack down hard on anyone
who runs risks with human safety. We are looking at very
sophisticated criminal fraud that has gone beyond the EU itself."
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister Tony Blair has reportedly agreed to give
new powers to British enforcement authorities in an effort to put
an end to illegal beef traffic.
</P>
<P>
However, Cunningham confirmed that the new Labor government
would not withdraw an action against the EU's worldwide ban at the
European Court of Justice. He said that "it's going to be an
important test of the legality of the ban," which was imposed in
March 1996.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that Britain expected the rest of the EU
countries to live up to the standards that it had set for British
beef in order to "ensure that imports have been given the same
rigorous treatment on the removal of specified materials."

<HEADLINE> S.Leonean Delegation to Talk With ECOWAN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, July 16 (Xinhua) -- A four- man delegation sent by
the Sierra Leonean military junta left here Wednesday for talks
with an ECOWAS mediation commission in Ivory Coast in an attempt
to end the seven week political impasse in Sierra Leone after the
may 25 coup.
</P>
<P>
Leader of the Sierra Leonean delegation, Chief Secretary
of State (prime minister) Solomon Musa said, ''We are going to
put the case for the coup across at last''.
</P>
<P>
" The international community has not given us the opportunity
to air our grievances and they had condemned us outright,'' he
said at the internatiomal airport which is still being held by
Nigerian troops.
</P>
<P>
A group of heavily armed Nigerian soldiers watched the
interview from a distance.
</P>
<P>
According to a foreign ministry official, the junta delegation
will press for the formation of a broad-based government to
involve all key actors in Sierra Leone's politics including
former president Kabbah and rebel leader Foday Ssankoh.
</P>
<P>
The delegatiom will also press for a national comference to be
held in Freetown to work out modalities for general elections.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Sierra Leone's military leader Johnny Paul Koroma
said that his government '' is only here to correct wreckless
situation that was apparently going on during the civilian
regime.''
</P>
<P>
'' The only way out is to give us some time so that we can
correct and straight out the situation in the country. We are
soldiers and we shall be going back to the barracks,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
He went on, ''All we need now is to correct the situation
especially now that we have succeeded in bringing peace to the
country.''
</P>
<P>
He warned, ''Now that peace is at out doorstep. If we allow
it to slip away, we shall never get it again because the rebels
will not go back to the bush. They will stay in Freetown and
shall not go anywhere. ''

<HEADLINE> France Denies Report on Bosnia SFOR Raid Refusal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 16 (Xinhua) -- France today denied a report by the
U.S. newspaper the New York Times that French troops deployed in
Bosnia refused to carry out a second raid planned by NATO-led
Stabilization Force (SFOR) to arrest Serbian war crime suspects.
</P>
<P>
"This report is devoid of any ground. The French forces in
Bosnia are an integral part of the SFOR, obey the rules of
engagement decided by NATO and follow the instructions of the
command of the force," said French Foreign Ministry spokesman
Jacques Rummelhardt.
</P>
<P>
Quoting unidentified U.S. and French officials, the New York
Times said in its latest issue that France refused to associate
with a new operation against war crime suspects, regarding it as
"too risky."
</P>
<P>
An SFOR operation against Serbian suspects, launched last
Thursday by British and American troops in northwestern Bosnia,
resulted in the death of one Serbian suspect and the arrest of
another.
</P>
<P>
"France has never ceased to stress that the digging-in of the
peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina demands that justice prevail, and this
will pass in particular through the judgment of persons accused of
war crimes," said Rummelhardt.
</P>
<P>
He also said that France was the origin of the idea to set up
the International Criminal Tribunal (TPI) in the Hague to try
Bosnian war criminals.
</P>
<P>
"We have always insisted on the need that the persons accused
by the TPI be arrested and brought to this jurisdiction in the
Hague," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The operation last week was launched in Prijedor, which is
located in a region under the command of British troops deployed
in Bosnia, while most of Serbian war crime suspects are holding
out in Pale, in a region under the command of French SFOR troops.
</P>
<P>
France said that the operation launched last week by British
troops was "legitimate and fully in conformity with the mandate of
the SFOR," but it prefers that the operation to arrest war
criminals be carried out by Bosnians themselves.

<HEADLINE> Come to Britain for Quality, Added Value: Beckett </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 16 (Xinhua) -- A campaign, to ensure Britain is
the preferred location for inward investors, was spelt out today
by President of the Board of Trade Margaret Beckett.
</P>
<P>
Foreign direct investment in Britain soared 24 percent last
year to a record 9.34 billion pounds (14.9 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the launch of the Invest in Britain Bureau's (IBB)
Annual Review of Operations 1997, Beckett said, "The key to many
investment decisions has been the creation of partnerships between
business, investment agencies, local and national government."
</P>
<P>
"Our aim now is to ensure that attractive conditions are
maintained and such partnerships developed further so that Britain
can meet the very real challenges that lie ahead in competing for
investment on the world stage," she added.
</P>
<P>
IBB's Annual Review of Operations 1997 revealed a record 483
projects during 1996/97. These created 46,179 jobs and safeguarded
a further 47,545 jobs.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 70 projects were foreign acquisitions. US, German and
Japanese firms committed billions of pounds between them to the
automotive industry -- both motor manufacturing and component
suppliers.
</P>
<P>
World-class companies have continued to invest in British
utilities, while trans-Atlantic and Far Eastern firms alike looked
to the UK to establish their European headquarters.
</P>
<P>
The US remains the single biggest source of foreign direct
investment in Britain. US companies accounted for investment worth
3.9 billion pounds (6.24 billion US dollars) -- 43 percent of the
total.
</P>
<P>
Beckett also outlined four key areas -- economic stability,
skills, Europe and competitiveness -- where the UK can help create
a business environment within which firms will want to work, and
underlined the importance of partnership in promoting Britain in
the global market for inward investment.
</P>
<P>
Expressing her confidence in the competitive world, she said,
"Britain is rightly proud of its record in attracting inward
investment from around the world and we have good reason to be
confident about the future."

<HEADLINE> Southern African Bio-medical Meeting Opens in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The Bio-Medical Research and
Training Institute (BRTI) meeting began here today, stressing the
importance of action-oriented research in the improvement of
the health sectors in the southern African countries.
</P>
<P>
BRTI, which aims to collaborate with institutes and
laboratories in the Southern African Development Community
(SADC), is a regional research and training institute formed two
years ago to spearhead a common approach to the region's health
problems.
</P>
<P>
More than 25 representatives from SADC ministries of health,
research institutes and universities from Denmark, Switzerland,
Nertherlands, Tanzania, the United States and the United Kingdom
attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
BRTI board Chairman Stephen Chandiwana said decision making by
policy makers needed to be backed by accurate information,
especially in this era where most African governments were faced
by a serious shortage of resources.
</P>
<P>
He said, ''At another level, health managers and workers need
to carry out simple operational research to improve programatic
performance, hence the need to include all actors in health and
health-related research.''
</P>
<P>
He revealed that of the 30 billion U.S.Dollars investment in
health worldwide, oniy 1.6 billion dollars or five percent, was
earmarked for health in developing countries and only 150 million
dollars or 0.1 percent was used for direct support of research
activities in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
''The provision of a centre where established scientists can
conduct high quality, relevant research is essential, if Africa
is to retain and develop its scientific resources,'' he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Chandiwana called for financial assistance to promoe active
research in bio-medicine in sub-Saharan Africa.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Indigenous Businesses Urged to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 16 (Xinhua) -- A senior Zimbabwean official today urged
indigenous business groups to participate in the government's
proposed five-year program to provide water to rural communities
constituting 70 percent of the population.
</P>
<P>
Lands and Water Resources Deputy Minister Cain Mathema said
the 227.3 million U.S. Dollars program presented vast
opportunities for emerging business people to form companies that
could build dams, drill boreholes and erect reticulation systems
to improve the supply of water.
</P>
<P>
He said, "The intention is to improve the country's main
income earner -- agriculture -- through widespread irrigation
schemes in communal and small scale farming areas while we
provide the people with clean and purified water right at their
door-steps."
</P>
<P>
While the government initiated and was championing the
program, it did not have enough funds, and was therefore
appealing for private sector's participation, he said.
</P>
<P>
"So far we have got overwhelming support from commercial
farmers who have either entered into joint ventures with us, or
have availed some of their privately developed water sources to
our people," he said.

<HEADLINE> Israel Strongly Denounces UN Resolution on Settlements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Israel strongly denounced the
resolution adopted by the United Nations (UN) General Assembly
overnight which called for sanctions against Israel's settlement
activities.
</P>
<P>
The Assembly passed the non-binding resolution in a vote of
131 in favor, 3 against, with 14 abstentions. It condemned
Israel for failing to comply with the earlier resolution
adopted by the Assembly in April which called for an halt
to the building of Har Homa settlement in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The resolution called on U.N. members to actively discourage
activities that contribute to the Jewish settlements, while
demanding Israel provide information on the goods produced by
its settlements.
</P>
<P>
In his reaction, Israeli Prime Minister Binjamin Netanyahu
criticized the U.N. for dealing with the issues of "building
housing for youth couples in Israel's capital city" when
there are wars and hunger in other places of the world.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister David Levy denounced the U.N. resolution for
contradicting the peace process and creating unnecessary tensions
in the region. He called for an end to what he dubbed as
"an ugly game to try to isolate and accuse Israel" in the
U.N..
</P>
<P>
Levy paid tributes to the United States and Micronesia, the
only two states voted against the resolution together with
Israel. He also called for a code of behavior in
Israeli-Palestinian negotiations, saying the two sides should
solve the differences through direct negotiations rather than
bringing them to the international arena.
</P>
<P>
This was the third resolution passed by the U.N. General
Assembly to condemn the building of Har Homa settlement since
Israel started the construction in March. The Israeli-Palestinian
peace negotiations have been frozen since then, leading to a
rising tension and escalating violence between the two sides.

<HEADLINE> Khamenei Urges to Fight Corruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei
today called on the nation to fight against ever worsening
violation of public security.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with commanders of the Law Enforcement Forces and
officials of the social welfare organizations, Khamenei stressed
"security should govern every aspect of public life."
</P>
<P>
He called for strong measures against those violating public
security.
</P>
<P>
"The Law Enforcement Forces should strictly observe morals and
ethics and should bear themselves with trust and dignity in
discharging their duties," he was quoted by the official news
agency IRNA as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, he stressed, "those elements violating the spirit and
letter of the law from inside the police force itself should be
severely dealt with."
</P>
<P>
The Ayatollah urged law enforcement officials to expose any
wrongdoings within the forces and not to be lenient to any failure
on those in performing their duties.
</P>
<P>
The statement by Khamenei indicates that the top Iranian
leaders have already been aware of public complaints about
violations of the Law Enforcement Forces, such as abuse of rights,
extortion for money and other kinds of corruption.
</P>
<P>
"The Law Enforcement Forces should be changed into a body that
the Islamic system requires," the supreme leader said.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei also called on the legislative body and the judiciary
to deal with those who have accumulated unauthorized assets,
adding "we will not allow a new class to take shape such as those
who misuse the public funds for their personal purposes."
</P>
<P>
"Those committed to Islam and the Islamic revolution will not
allow such wrongdoings or the emergence of a new class made
wealthy with unauthorized assets through misuse of public funds,"
he warned.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Experts: Absurd Historical Views Aim to Disrupt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Four prominent Chinese experts on
international relations have attacked the absurd historical views
of Japanese right-wing groups which are intended to disrupt
Sino-Japanese relations. They gave their views in an interview to
be published by China's Guang Ming Daily newspaper on Thursday.
The following are extracts from the article:
</P>
<P>
Fang Lianqing, vice president of the International Relations
Institute attached to Beijing University, said a small right-wing
force has always existed in Japan and has disrupted the healthy
development of Sino-Japanese relations.
</P>
<P>
They have published a number of books in recent years to
eulogize the history of Japan's invasion of other Asian nations
including China.
</P>
<P>
One of the books, running to hundreds of thousands words, a
summary of the so-called "Great East Asia War," surprisingly
attempted to reverse the verdict on Japanese aggression.
</P>
<P>
Those kinds of books whitewashed the invasive nature of the war
launched by Japan, glorifying the bloody history of Japan's
invasion and justifying the actions of Japanese fascist war
criminals.
</P>
<P>
Luo Weilong, deputy chairman of the China Society for the Study
of Japanology, said that those right-wing figures not only
vilified the Japanese politicians who faced up to and admitted the
correct view of history, but also condemned the media and
education circles who told the truth, complaining that Japan was
trapped by a "syndrome of national self-maltreatment" and a
"syndrome of historical self-maltreatment."
</P>
<P>
Jiang Daonai, secretary general of China's Society for the
History of Sino-Japanese Relations, said that those right-wing
figures were advocating Japanese people to restore "the national
spirit" of the Japanese nation and to reestablish the so-called
"correct Japanese outlook of history."
</P>
<P>
Liu Jiangyong, a research fellow with the Institute for the
Study of Modern International Relations, said that after several
decades of economic development, Japan has become a major
economic power in the world over the past few years. With this, a
sense of national pride has begun to take root in the minds of a
number of Japanese people.
</P>
<P>
Under such conditions, a handful of Japanese right-wing figures
have taken advantage of the change in attitude of Japanese people,
seeking to mislead the younger generation and national sentiment
and to disrupt Japan's peaceful development and the main trend in
Sino-Japanese relations.
</P>
<P>
When asked about the facts of the Marco Polo Bridge Incident
and the Rape of Nanjing (Nanking), Luo Weilong strongly criticized
those right-wing figures for distorting history by claiming that,
"the Marco Polo Bridge Incident was created by the Chinese side;
Chinese troops opened fire first; Japan had no plan to invade
China; the death toll in the Rape of Nanjing (Nanking) was
recklessly concocted." More

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Investments Show Confidence In Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Five Hong Kong investments last
year confirmed the high degree of confidence in the UK from the
now special administrative region of China.
</P>
<P>
Details released today by the British government's Invest in
Britain Bureau (IBB) show Hong Kong firms invested around 80
million US dollars in the UK during the 1996/97 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
During the year the United Nations Conference on Trade and
Development reported that direct investment by Hong Kong and other
Asian countries in Europe reached an average 860 million US
dollars between 1992 and 1994, with 40 percent of the European
Union's entire stock from that source going to the UK.
</P>
<P>
Britain also continued to attract over 40 percent of the EU's
American investment and was the leading recipient of cross-border
investment among member countries as well.
</P>
<P>
In all, the total value of foreign owned investment stock in
the UK is estimated to have reached nearly 256 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Sales of British businesses to overseas investors were
estimated to have exceeded the total for all other EU combined.
Some 60 percent of new investments were expansions by existing
investors.
</P>
<P>
The new Labor government is strongly committed to encouraging
further investment and maintaining stable conditions through
flexibility and competitiveness.

<P>
Fang Lianqing said that history cannot be distorted.
</P>
<P>
Japanese troops, after launching the September 18 Incident and
annexing the three northeastern provinces, conspired to invade
northern China and wage an all-out war against China.
</P>
<P>
The Hiroda cabinet convened a meeting attended by five
ministers in 1936 and worked out an invasion plan to occupy
northern China and Shanghai first and then other parts of China.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Japanese forces began to invade northern
China through Shanhaiguan, a strategic pass connecting
northeastern and northern China.
</P>
<P>
The then First Head of the Japanese Army's Chief of General
Staff Yshihara admitted that the invasion of northern China led
directly to the Marco Polo Bridge Incident.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, the regimental commander of Japan's troops of
aggression at the time, Muda, confessed, "It was me who fired the
first shot near the Marco Polo Bridge which set off the war.
That's why I think I should take responsibility for the war."
</P>
<P>
Liu Yongjiang said the archcriminal of the Rape of Nanjing,
the Commander of Japan's troops in eastern China, Matsui, wrote in
the Outline to Conquer Nanjing City that "Occupying Nanjing is
intended to force China to surrender."
</P>
<P>
Luo Weilong quoted a report by a New York Times' correspondent
as saying he witnessed three massacres of captives within a few
hours.
</P>
<P>
Three reporters with the Domei News Service, who entered
Nanjing three days after Japanese troops conquered the city, wrote
in their dispatches that they saw 2,000-3,000 charred bodies along
the river bank from Xiaguan to Caoxiexia, and that, ordered by
officers, Japanese troops stabbed Chinese captives to death one by
one as target practice for bayonet fighting and threw their bodies
into air-raid shelters. More

</P>
<P>
The Muslim Brotherhood, a major opposition party in Jordan,
declared its boycott of the elections earlier last week.
</P>
<P>
The general supervisor of the party Abdul Majeed Thneibat
said Saturday that the Press and Publication Law, the
one-person-one-vote election system, the normalization of ties
with Israel and "the government`s measures to marginalize
political parties" were the main reasons behind the movement`s
decision to boycott the 1997 general elections.
</P>
<P>
Other opposition parties, including the biggest one the
Islamic Action Front, are also considering to go after the
Muslim Brotherhood.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian government Tuesday made the first official
response to the boycott with a statement saying that the
government was to hold free and fair parliamentary elections as
scheduled in November with or without the participation of the
opposition.

<HEADLINE> Zanzibar to Launch Drive for Raising Investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The Zanzibar government
will embark on a major promotional drive to restore investors
confidence and boost business transactions.
</P>
<P>
According to a report reaching here today, Minister of State
in the President's Office (for Planning and Investments), Ali
Juma Shamhuna, has said that Zanzibar will put more efforts on
selling itself to Southern African Development Community (SADC)
countries, Middle East and Far East, Gulf states and the Indian
Ocean island nations to raise investors confidence.
</P>
<P>
Investors from the mentioned areas have shown great interest
in investing in Zanzibar, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the decision on the selected countries was reached
after a survey and visits conducted to those countries during
1995/96 and 1996/97.
</P>
<P>
Shamhuna said that at present the Isles were experiencing a
"great investment wave from the United States and Europe. He
atributed this trend to " a massive campaign to publicise the
Isles".
</P>
<P>
He said his ministry was presently engaged in finalising a
report on "Vision 2020", a long term plan which will serve as a
guide to the Isles development plans.
</P>
<P>
Completion of the report will be followed by a mass education
and publicity campaign on its implemention, he said.

On certain incidents of aggression provoked by Japan, Liu
Jiangyong said there are plenty of facts to illustrate that the
"September 18 Incident" in 1931, the "Marco Polo Bridge Incident"
in 1937 and the following all-out war of aggression against China
were all premediated and elaborately planned by the Japanese
militarists.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the frequent attempts by some Japanese
right-wingers to seek a lawful "basis" for the Japanese
aggression, Liu said that these people, who claimed that "the
definition of aggression is not fixed," denied the existence of
the word of "aggression."
</P>
<P>
These people went so far as to claim that the English word
"aggression" meant "attack" rather than "capture" and thus could
not be categorized as a crime in terms of the international law,
said Liu.
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the meaning of "aggression" illustrated by Kojigen, an
authoritative Japanese dictionary cannot be clearer: "What is
called aggression means invasion into another country and capture
its land," said Liu.
</P>
<P>
The Dictionary on International Law compiled by the Japanese
Institute of International Law says, "Aggression generally refers
to the aim and act of one country to attempt to realize the claim
on another country by means of force so as to change the
situation." More

<HEADLINE> UNDP Head Praises Annan's Reform Proposals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 16 (Xinhua) -- James Gustave Speth,
administrator of the United Nations Development Program, today
praised the bold reform plans proposed by U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
"I strongly support the Secretary-General's initiatives because
they will strengthen and streamline the U.N. on every front --
peace and security, human rights, development cooperation,
humanitarian affairs and economic and social affairs," Speth said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the special meeting of the U.N. General Assembly
early this morning, Annan said that his reform recommendations
were "the most extensive and far-reaching" ones since the world
body was founded 52 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Among his many innovative actions, Annan established the United
Nations Development Group (UNDG) which will be composed of U.N.
funds and programs engaged in development cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Building on existing arrangements, the UNDG will ensure greater
coordination and policy coherence among U.N. development agencies.
It will also strengthen their ability to deliver high-quality
assistance without compromising the identities of the
organizations in the UNDG framework.
</P>
<P>
Most of the U.N.'s financial resources are dedicated to
assisting the poor. Through programs in more than 150 countries,
the U.N. provideds about 3 billions U.S. dollars a year in
development assistance and another 3 billions U.S. dollars in
humanitarian aid.
</P>
<P>
"The United Nations has a track record second to none in
promoting sustainable and equitable development," Speth said.
"This record provides the most compelling case for strengthening
the UN in the economic, social and environmental area -- and the
reforms put forward by the Secretary-General will help achieve
this goal."

<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Israel is willing to strengthen
its cooperation relations with Angola, visiting Israeli deputy
speaker of parliament Yehuda Lankry said here today.
</P>
<P>
After his talks with Angolan Prime Minister Franca Van-Dunem,
Lankry told reporters that some progress has been made in
bilateral cooperation, especially in the fields of agriculture
and education, since the establishment of diplomatic relations
between the two countries in 1995.
</P>
<P>
He said that during the talks, he also discussed the Angolan
peace process and the Middle East peace process with the Angolan
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Lankry added that Israel is following "with great interest"
the development of the Angolan peace process, because the Middle
East peace process is meeting with similar difficulties and is in
subtle situation.
</P>
<P>
He said that Israel wants to know how the Angolan government
will overcome these difficulties and bring final peace to their
country.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the Middle East peace process, he said his
country and Palestine are making positive efforts to find a way
of reopening negotiations between the two sides.

<HEADLINE> Export-led Growth, Corner Stone of Pak Economic Policy: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Commerce Minister
Muhammad Ishaq Dar said here today that export-led growth is the
corner stone of the government's economic strategy.
</P>
<P>
To lay the foundation for robust outward-oriented economy, it
is now imperative to reverse the anti-export bias in the economic
structure evolved over the last fifty years, Dar said when
unveiling an export-friendly trade policy for the 1997-1998 fiscal
year.
</P>
<P>
The government, he said, is placing special emphasis on the
development of non-traditional items and introduction of Pakistani
products in new markets, including computer software, industrial
designing, engineering goods and furniture.
</P>
<P>
To facilitate smooth flow of exports, it is imperative that all
formalities related to exports should be completed in minimum
possible time, he said.
</P>
<P>
The government already commissioned an export terminal at
Karachi, which provides this facility to exporters under one roof,
he added.
</P>
<P>
In keeping with the government's commitment to an outward
looking dynamic approach to economic issues, the trade policy for
1997-98 is a reflection of this objective, the commerce minister
noted.
</P>
<P>
The measures being initiated through the trade policy will add
to the incentives already announced by the government in the prime
minister's economic revival package and the federal budget, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to decisions taken to facilitate export-related
activities, he said, freight subsidies will continue to be
available on the export of fruits and vegetables only.
</P>
<P>
Private sector will be allowed and supported by the government
on "build, own and operate" (BOO) basis to construct
infrastructure including airports, roads, storage and packaging
facilities, he said.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Sees US Ties with Arab States in Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez
Boueiz said here today that relations between the United
States and Arab states are in crisis due to a shift of
Washington's policy in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Milhem Karam, chairman of the Lebanese
Press Syndicate, the foreign minister said that the
administration of President Bill Clinton has withdrawn from its
role as a "pushing power" in the Middle East peace process
after the Israeli government asked it to do so.
</P>
<P>
"Today it seems that after Israel asked the U.S. to
freeze its activities, the U.S. has retreated from the principle
of pushing power," Boueiz told Karam. "And it seems that
interests of the U.S. with Israel have overpassed its
international role."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that Washington has shifted from its previous
firm position toward settlements in West Bank and Gaza strip,
with the evidence of the veto it used against U.N. resolutions
condemning Israel's refusal to stop building Jewish settlements
in occupied territories.
</P>
<P>
Among 148 countries voting in the General Assembly Tuesday
night, the U.S., Israel and Micronesia were the only three
countries voted against the resolution, which urges U.N. member
states to "actively discourage" settlement-building activities. 14
countries abstained in the vote.
</P>
<P>
The decision taken by the U.S. congress last month
recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital and asking the
administration to move the American embassy to the city from
Tel Aviv was another evidence indicating the change in
Washington's policy, the Lebanese minister noted.
</P>
<P>
"As a result of these upsetting steps, the United States has
gone out of the principles of the peace process which had been
agreed upon, in an addition to retracting its guarantees related
to definite messages on the Israeli withdrawals (from occupied
Arab lands)," the foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
"Because of these reasons, the relations between the United
States and all the Arab states has begun passing through a
crisis," Boueiz added.
</P>
<P>
"There is a scathing blame on the United states for its
failure to exert pressure on (Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin)
Netanyahu or use its influence to draw him back to the
peace process and the Madrid principles despite it knows
Netanyahu's negativity," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese foreign minister also criticized U.S. Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright because since her appointment she
has not paid a single visit to the region, nor conducted
more contacts, in order to get a knowledge on the "thorny"
situation in the Middle East.

<HEADLINE> Kohl Voices Firm Support for Slovenia's Bid for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, July 16 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Helmut Kohl today
told visiting Slovenian Prime Minister Janez Drnovsek that Germany
firmly supported Slovenia's bid to join the European Union (EU), a
German government spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Drnovsek's visit to Bonn came as the EU announced in Strasbourg
today that Slovenia and five other European nations had been
selected as candidates for its eastward enlargement. The EU also
said that accession negotiations with these countries would begin
early next year.
</P>
<P>
According to German government spokesman Peter Hausmann, Kohl
stressed that the decision made by the EU in Strasbourg was a
recognition of Slovenia's progress in democratic and economic
reforms.
</P>
<P>
Slovenia was excluded earlier this month from making the first
wave to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). At the
insistence of the United States, the NATO summit in Madrid on July
8-9 only selected Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic to join
the Western alliance in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Kohl told Drnovsek that Germany had "great sympathy" for
Slovenia's wish for a speedy admission into NATO and supported the
country's efforts to this end.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the NATO summit had made clear that the door
would remain open to admit further new members and it had also
given special emphasis on the positive development in Slovenia.
</P>
<P>
Since Slovenia's NATO bid was turned down in Madrid, some
Slovenian opposition leaders have reportedly accused the
government of relying too much on the backing of France and Italy
and not enlisting sufficient support from Bonn.

<HEADLINE> Israel Accuses Palestinian Policemen Of Terrorist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli Defense Minister,
Yitzhak Mordechai, today again accused three Palestinian policemen
of involvement in what he called a terrorist gang, according
to a report of the state-run Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters, Mordechai said that Israel is very
concerned about the fact that Palestinian policemen took part
in a terrorist mission. He was referring to three Palestinian
policemen who were arrested by Israeli security forces earlier
this week.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) claimed that the three
were on their way to carry out an attack on the Jewish
settlement of Har Bracha near Nablus.
</P>
<P>
But the Palestinian Police denied that the three policemen
were on their way to attack Israelis. A senior Palestinian
police official said the three, one of whom was wounded
during the arrest and hospitalized at Tel Hashomer, were in
pursuit of a "suspicious vehicle."
</P>
<P>
"It is too dangerous. It is something that can damage the
whole peace process with the Palestinians," Mordechai warned.
</P>
<P>
He said that it is necessary for (PLO) Chairman (Yasser)
Arafat and the Palestinian National Authority to understand that
it is the highest mistake that has been made by the Palestinian
police to use their weapons and power against the Israeli people.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai said that their weapons should be used against
violence and terrorism and establish order and peace in the
area.
</P>
<P>
Israel was furious when Palestinian police used their weapons
to fight Israeli soldiers in September last year. A total of
15 Israeli soldiers were killed during the bloody clashes, which
happened due to the opening by Israel of a tunnel close to
Temple Mount, the Moslem holy site, in the Old City of
East Jerusalem.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Experts: Absurd Historical Views Aim to Disrupt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When asked about whether Japan's view of history will affect
Sino-Japanese friendship, Jiang Daoding said how to view Japanese
militarists' war of aggression against China is a matter of
principle and is directly related to the political foundation for
Sino-Japanese relations.
</P>
<P>
Fang Lianqing said some Japanese politicians have frequently
made indiscreet remarks about historical events. This has grown
into a trend formed by absurd historical views in Japan, and if
unchecked, would obstruct the development of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Developing friendly relations between China and Japan is of
vital strategic importance to both countries. In fact, the
significance of Sino-Japanese relations has gone beyond a
bilateral level, Luo Weilong noted.
</P>
<P>
He said that the stability or otherwise of bilateral relations
would have implications not only for Japan but also the
Asia-Pacific region and even the whole world.
</P>
<P>
On the question of whether the key to the development of
bilateral relations is Japan's adoption of a correct view of
history, Liu Jiangyong said that taking a correct historical view
has become important not only for Japan's future development but
also for maintaining the hard-won friendship between China and
Japan.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Daoding noted that it was rare in world history that
there were so many conflicting views of a period of history only
50 years previously within Japan's political, media and academic
circles.
</P>
<P>
But how could the Japanese look toward the future in a
scientific and reasonable way if they were even unable to forge a
basic consensus on their own history based on facts, Jiang Daoding
asked.
</P>
<P>
Liu Jiangyong said China will not conclude that Japan is
advocating militarism simply from the remarks and activities of a
small right-wing force in the country.
</P>
<P>
China understands that the Japanese people in general are
peace-loving and the Japanese government tolerates no revival of
militarism. Hereby, we would like to advise those in Japan who
are farsighted enough to pay due attention to the destructive and
dangerous nature of these absurd historical views, and to
consciously resist these views, Liu Jiangyong added.

<HEADLINE> Annan's Reform on UN leadership, Management </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 16 (Xinhua) -- United Nations
Secretary-General Kofi Annan today announced before the United
Nations General Assembly his recommendations for the most
extensive and far-reaching reform of the United Nations since it
was founded 52 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The Secretary-General's recommendations are embodied in a
report titled "Renewing the United Nations: A Program for Reform,"
in response to the need of the United Nations to deliver more and
better services at less cost. The recommendations also respond to
member states' increasing development, and peacekeeping and
humanitarian needs anticipated for the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
On reform of the leadership and management of the United
Nations, the Secretary-General proposed the following:
</P>
<P>
The Secretary-General proposes to set up a cabinet-style
management entity, to be called the "Senior Management Group,"
consisting of eight or nine senior officials and acting as a
decision-making and policy-making body;
</P>
<P>
The Secretary-General proposes the creation of a post of Deputy
Secretary-General to act in the Secretary-Genenal's absence, to
share his representational duties and to link actions and policies
that cut across administrative and sectoral boundaries;
</P>
<P>
The Secretary-General recommends that the General Assembly
review its agenda which currently consist of over 160 agenda
items appearing annually and retire agenda items that are no
longer of high priorities and review the agenda periodically for
further adoption to current needs;
</P>
<P>
The Secretary-General recommends that the General Assembly
periodically focus its discussion for a concentrated period of
time on major issues of international importance such as financing
for development. Such focus will encourage participation at the
highest level by ministers and heads of states;
</P>
<P>
The reform proposals also recommend shorting the session of
the General Assembly by three weeks from about 15 weeks to
about 12;
</P>
<P>
The Secretary-General recommends to the General Assembly that
whenever it adopts a new program requiring significant staffing
and financing commitment, the program should include a sunset
provision;
</P>
<P>
Finally the Secretary-General recommends the adoption of a
results-based budgeting system.

<HEADLINE> Qatari Emir Leaves for Britain for Support to Doha </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Qatar's Emir Sheikh Hamad ben
Khalifa al Thani left the Qatari capital Doha this afternoon for
Britain to drum up support to the Doha Economic Summit should be
attended by Middle East and North African nations visit.
</P>
<P>
The Qatari news agency reported his departure, but gave no
details of his five-day visit to the European nation.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats here say that among other things, the Qatari the
Qatari Emir is expected to hold talks with British leaders on
boosting bilateral relations and issues of common interest,
particularly, the fourth Middle East and North Africa Economic
Conference due to take place in Qatar in November.
</P>
<P>
Qatar is facing difficulties in hosting the conference because
of possible boycott of the conference by some Arab countries due
to Israel's participation. Syria, Lebanon and Saudi Arabia have
already voiced their opposition to the summit.
</P>
<P>
The boycott is aimed to protest against Israel's hardline
policies in the stalled Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Though the U.S. has urged Arab countries to participate in the
conference, Qatar also hopes to obtain European support to persuade
these Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
Qatar has determined to host the conference despite pressure
from Syria and some other Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
"Our main concern at present is to make arrangements for
the conference and we are going ahead with it," Qatar's Minister
of State for Foreign Affairs Ahmed Abdullah al-Mahmoud
said earlier this month.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus President on Bi-Communal Direct Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides
said here today that the U.N.-led direct talks in the U.S. was
held in a very good atmosphere but no progress was made in solving
the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Speaking upon his return from a ten-day visit to the U.S. and
Britain, where he attended direct talks between the Greek and
Turkish Cypriot sides and had a meeting with British Prime
Minister Tony Blair, President Clerides noted, however, that he
"did not expect any developments on Cyprus issue as it is still
too early".
</P>
<P>
"A process has started and is continuing", he said,
pointing out that "progress will occur when the gap between
the positions held by the two sides is bridged."
</P>
<P>
The President explained that the U.N. Secretary General's
Special Advisor on Cyprus, Diego Cordovez, who coordinated the
talks in Troutbeck, prepared a non-paper that will become a
paper if the two sides agree to it.
</P>
<P>
The two sides, he said, will study the non-paper and then
express their positions.
</P>
<P>
President Clerides also referred to his proposal for a
meeting with Denktash in Nicosia, under the auspices of U.N.
Resident Representative, Gustave Feissel, in order to discuss
humanitarian issues, especially that of persons missing since the
Turkish occupation of the north in 1974.
</P>
<P>
There is no agenda for the Nicosia meeting, the President
said, adding that humanitarian issues, including that of Greek
Cypriot enclaved in the northern Turkish-controlled part of the
island, were also discussed in Troutbeck.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops took
over the northern third of the island following a failed coup
by Greek Cypriots allied with the military junta that ruled
Greece at the time.

<HEADLINE> Slovenian PM Upbeat About Chances to Join EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Slovenia apparently sees its chances
to join the European Union (EU) improved after acquiring assurance
from German Chancellor Helmut Kohl today that Germany will firmly
support Slovenia's membership bid.
</P>
<P>
Slovenian Prime Minister Janez Drnovsek told the German news
agency DPA after a meeting with Kohl today in Bonn that he was
pleased with Bonn's suggestion that the EU admit new members
individually, and not in groups as was the case in 1995 when it
took in Austria, Finland and Sweden.
</P>
<P>
"If Slovenia is treated individually, we think that we will
have much better chances," he said.
</P>
<P>
Drnovsek's visit to Bonn came as the EU announced in Strasbourg
today that Slovenia and five other European nations had been
selected as new member candidates with which it will begin
accession negotiations early next year.
</P>
<P>
Despite some analysts' belief that the EU is unlikely to admit
new members until after 2002, Drnovsek said, "I still think
Slovenia could become a (EU) member by 2001 or at least 2002."
</P>
<P>
According to German government spokesman Peter Hausmann, Kohl
told Drnovsek that Germany firmly supported Slovenia's bid to join
the EU, and that the decision made by the EU in Strasbourg was a
recognition of Slovenia's progress in democratic and economic
reforms.
</P>
<P>
Slovenia was excluded earlier this month from making the first
wave to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). At the
insistence of the United States, the NATO summit in Madrid on July
8-9 only selected Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic to join
the Western alliance in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Kohl told Drnovsek that Germany had "great sympathy" for
Slovenia's wish for a speedy admission into NATO and supported the
country's efforts to this end.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the NATO summit had made clear that the door
would remain open to admit further new members and it had also
given special emphasis on the positive development in Slovenia.
</P>
<P>
Since Slovenia's NATO bid was turned down in Madrid, some
Slovenian opposition leaders have reportedly accused the
government of relying too much on the backing of France and Italy
and not enlisting sufficient support from Bonn.

<HEADLINE> Annan's Reform Proposals on UN Structure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 16 (Xinhua) -- United Nations
Secretary-General Kofi Annan announced today before the General
Assembly his recommendations for the most extensive and
far-reaching reform of the U.N. since it was founded 52 years ago.
</P>
<P>
On reforming the structure of the United Nations, the
Secretary-General proposes the following:
</P>
<P>
The budget for 1998-1999 presented to the General Assembly
implements the cutting of 1,000 secretariat posts;
</P>
<P>
Three United Nations departments in economic and social affairs
at the secretariat are being integrated into one new department,
achieving significant greater unity of purpose and the coherence
of efforts;
</P>
<P>
United Nations programs in fighting crimes, drug trafficking,
money laundering and terrorism are to be combined in Vienna, under
one administrator, Senator Arlacchi of Italy, who is a specialist
on organized crime;
</P>
<P>
The center for human rights and the Office of the High
Commissioner for Human Rights are bing consolidated into one
office headed by Mary Robinson, currently president of Ireland, as
the new High Commissioner;
</P>
<P>
Three separate entities of the United Nations secretariat that
assist intergovernmental bodies to run meetings are being
consolidated into one support service department.
</P>
<P>
The Secretary-General is initiating a move towards setting up
common facilities and support services in the 134 countries where
the United Nations has activities and provides services.
Significant saving should derive from the consolidation of
programs and agencies of administration in each country.
</P>
<P>
In the development field, various entities, including the
United Nations Children's fund and the United Nations Development
Program, are encouraged to develop a similar policy framework that
they will all utilize as a common starting point for their
specific programs.
</P>
<P>
The Secretary-General calls for simplification of United
Nations personnel and administrative rules.
</P>
<P>
Significant reductions in United Nations paperwork will be
sustained. Current projections for 1997 show that the United
Nations has reduced paper by 30 percent over 1995 use rates.

<HEADLINE> Liberian Presidential Campaign Ends Tomorrow: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, July 16 (Xinhua) - Campaign in Liberia's
presidential and parliamental elections which was due on Saturday
or July 19 will end tomorrow, a Liberian election official in
Monrovia told Xinhua today in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
"The campaign so far has been trouble free and we hope the
trend will continue," he said.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts said the election in which over 1.5 million
Liberians are expected to vote, will involve all political
parties and presidential aspirants.
</P>
<P>
The most notable will be Charles Taylor, leader of the
National Patriotic Council (NPC), Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, leader
of the Unity Party, George Boley of the National Democratic Party
and Al-Haji Kromah of the United Liberation Movement of Liberia
for Democracy (UNLIMO-K).
</P>
<P>
Taylor, who would climax his campaign on Thursday has been
tipped as the winner when the campaign started. However, he has
been on the slide during the past three weeks with
Johnson-Sirleaf and Kromah gaining some leads, election observers
said.
</P>
<P>
Kromah is already crying foul as he claimed in an interview
with Xinhua that some 500,000 of his supporters who are refugees
in neighboring Guinea have been stopped at the border from
entering the country to vote.
</P>
<P>
Kromah who carries his campaign like an American presidential
election boasted, "No matter what they do, I am certain to win."
</P>
<P>
U.N. election observers are already in Monrovia and will be
joined by human rights groups by Friday to monitor the polls.
</P>
<P>
The election is being supervised by the west African
peace-keeping troops Known as ECOMOG, which has brokered peace in
Liberia for the past seven years.
</P>
<P>
A new FM radio station funded by the United States government
was launched in Monrovia today to provide "unbiased news coverage
for voters in Saturday 's election.
</P>
<P>
Over 150,000 Liberians died in the rebel war with about a
million fleeing to other countries.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Lauds UN Resolution Condemning Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Egypt today hailed a UN General
Assembly resolution condemning Israel's Jewish expansionist policy
and requesting its members to halt support for Jewish settlements.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday the UN General Assembly for the third time voted
overwhelmingly to condemn Israel for the construction of a Jewish
neighborhood in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to reporters today, Assistant Foreign Minister
Sayed Qasim said the resolution is very significant because it won
the support of 131 countries across the the world.
</P>
<P>
Only Israel, the U.S. and Micronesia Islands voted against the
resolution.
</P>
<P>
"What is important in the resolution is that it urges member
countries not to encourage activities contributing to the
development of settlements," Qasim added.
</P>
<P>
The resolution, tabled by 15 Arab and Muslim countries, called
for an end of foreign aid to Jewish settlements in the West Bank
and Gaza and a ban on the import of goods produced there.
</P>
<P>
Although the resolution was non-binding, Arab and Muslim
countries considered it an important step in keeping up
international pressure against Israel's decision to go ahead with
a new Jewish housing project in East Jerusalem, which the
Palestinians want as their future capital.
</P>
<P>
The resolution followed up a recent report by UN
Secretary-General Kofi Annan confirming Israel's failure to stop
the Har Homa construction, a project that has paralyzed
Israeli-Palestinian peacemaking efforts and fueled violence in the
occupied Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
The United States has used its veto right in the Security
Council twice to block UN resolutions against the Israeli project.
</P>
<P>
In Tel Aviv, meanwhile, the resolution met with fierce attack
from Israeli Prime Minister Binjamin Netanyahu.

<HEADLINE> ECOMOG Commander Assures Security During Liberian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The commander of the west Africa
peace-keeping force in Liberia known as ECOMOG has assured that
there will be no security problem on Saturday's elections in
Liberia.
</P>
<P>
Major-General Victor Malu, the Nigerian commander of the
peace-keepers told a team of Japanese observers in the ECOMOG
headquarters in Monrovia Tuesday that his troops have expanded
its deployment in the Liberian hinterland in preparing for the
elections.
</P>
<P>

conductive security atmosphere for the elections that will end
Liberia's seven years of bloody civil war.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that all the candidates in the elections have
been moving freely in all parts of the country on their
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
On the elections day, ECOMOG troops will be present at all
polling stations and will provide security for all voters and
observers, Malu said.

government's assistance to the elections, which includes 300,000
U.S. Dollars for the purchase of communications equipment and
another 500,000 Dollars for hiring helicopters to aid transport
during the elections.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: West, Russia Remain Different on NATO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Western high officials flew to
Moscow one after another recently to allay Russia's concern after
NATO's Madrid summit held on July 8-9, that took a decision to
invite Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary to the military
alliance.
</P>
<P>
At the Madrid summit, NATO leaders also considered the
possibility of the Baltic states joining the alliance. These
actions, naturally, provoked Russia's dissatisfaction.
</P>
<P>
While reiterating its strong objection to the move, the Russian
leaders voiced their readiness to improve relations with
Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. To Russia, dialogue seems better
than confrontation.
</P>
<P>
First of all, Russian President Boris Yeltsin invited Finnish
President Martti Ahtisaari to the northern resort of Shuiskaya
Chupa in Karelia, where Yeltsin is holidaying, to "spend the
weekend together," combining recreation with discussion of
bilateral and international matters.
</P>
<P>
The topic of conversation between the two presidents was NATO's
promise that its door remains open to membership by the Baltic
states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania -- former Soviet republics
that Russia has insisted must remain outside the alliance.
</P>
<P>
Before Ahtisaari's departure, Yeltsin once again said that "we
will categorically oppose that," regarding NATO's invitation of
the Baltics as "dangerous."
</P>
<P>
For his part, the Finnish president said, "Each country can
resolve problems of its security on its own."
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright arrived in St.
Petersburg last Saturday, and had three-hour talks with Russian
Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed to speed up the modification of the Treaty
of Conventional Forces in Europe, to make joint efforts to promote
the Middle East peace process, and to consistently encourage the
implementation of the Dayton agreement in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
However, Russia and the U.S. remained different over the Baltic
states. Primakov said that Russia opposes the Baltic states'
admission to NATO, and emphasized "the Russian position does not
change depending on momentary interests."
</P>
<P>
The Russian foreign minister noted a system guaranteeing the
Baltic states' security, independence and sovereignty must be
created. "Such a system might be based on Russia's guarantees, or
on joint guarantees," he added.
</P>
<P>
In response to the question voiced by Primakov, Albright, who
was visiting in Vilnius, capital of Lithuania, said that the joint
guarantees are basically possible, but all countries, including
the three Baltic states, have an inseparable right to independent
choice of its security and stability.
</P>
<P>
During the visit of British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, who
arrived in Moscow last Sunday, NATO expansion, organized crime and
the situation in Bosnia were foremost topics for discussion
between the Russian and British foreign ministers.
</P>
<P>
Cook's visit was aimed at convincing that Russia will be "given
the opportunity" to contribute to European and world events. But
the two sides differed from each other over the arrest last week
of suspected war criminals in Bosnia by British forces.
</P>
<P>
When talking about the Russia-NATO ministerial meeting
scheduled for September in New York, Primakov suggested that the
issue of Bosnia be discussed and an armed force made of both
Russian and NATO troops be set up to deal with possible regional
conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Meeting with his visiting German counterpart, Klaus Kinkel, who
paid a short visit to Moscow Tuesday, Peimakov announced the
agenda for the Russia-NATO ministerial meeting scheduled in autumn
in New York, that is to address issues such as the Bosnian
situation, the peacekeeping mission, and international fight
against terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The two sides reached an agreement that Russia and Germany will
hold a regular summit since 1998 to further coordinate their
action and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Primakov repeatedly told Kinkel that NATO's eastward expansion
is the "biggest mistake" in Europe.
</P>
<P>
However, as part of the deal agreed upon, the alliance will
also stage a special conference in 1999 to review the broader
enlargement process.

<HEADLINE> Annan's Reform Proposals on UN Budgeting System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Secretary-General Kofi
Annan announced today before the United Nations General Assembly
his recommendations for the reform of the UN budgeting system,
calling for a new one with solvency and development priorities.
</P>
<P>
In his recommendations reforming the budgeting system of the
United Nations, Annan proposes the following:
</P>
<P>
The Secretary-General proposes to the General Assembly a small
budget for the period of 1998-1999 as compared to the 1997-1998
period. This will be the first time in a generation there has been
negative growth, in real terms, in the United Nations budget.
</P>
<P>
The Secretary-General has initiated a series of measures to
reduce administrative costs to 25 percent of the budget as
compared to 38 percent currently. Savings are anticipated to grow
to at least 200 million dollars for the biennium beginning 2002.
</P>
<P>
Savings derived from three administrative efficiencies will be
utilized as a development dividend to fund the United Nations
highest priority such as the alleviation of poverty and the
generation of economic growth among developing countries.
</P>
<P>
The Secretary-General proposes creation of a revolving fund, to
be capitalized up to 1 billion dollars, as an interim solution to
the United Nations current fiscal crisis. This fund of voluntary
contributions by governments will give the United Nations
accessible operating capital at times when arrears in country dues
are causing significant cash-flow problems.

<HEADLINE> New Grants for Police Programs Announced </HEADLINE>

<P>
WASHINGTON, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Government has
announced 50 million dollars in new COPS (Community Oriented
Policing Service) program grants to finance 600 new police
officers in 42 states, which means the program is at about
two-thirds of its commitment toward 100,000 new officers.
</P>
<P>
Communities in California, Louisiana and Florida are among the
biggest beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
The new grants mean more than 62,000 new officers either have
been added to the nation's streets or are in the hiring-training
pipeline since the 1994 Crime Act was passed.
</P>
<P>
The act promised to increase police presence by 20 percent by
the end of the decade under the COPS program.
</P>
<P>
The largest individual grant, 17.2 million dollars, goes to the
Sacramento police department in California to underwrite the costs
of 100 new officers for three years.

law for a third time since the law was enacted.
</P>
<P>
The Helms-Burton Act, designed to bring pressure on Cuba, was
signed into law in March last year. The law punishes foreign

</P>
<P>
"The president again has decided to suspend the right to file
suit under Title Three for an additional six months,"
Undersecretary of State Stuart Eizenstat told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
Under sharp criticism from the world community, Clinton has
twice before waived the controversial Title Three of the law, in
July 1996 and January 1997. Under the title, any U.S. citizens
will have legal rights to sue foreign firms which use confiscated
property once owned by them.
</P>
<P>
The law, which was first proposed by Senator Jesse Helms and
Representative Dan Burton, has been bitterly criticized by Canada
and the European Union, arguing that it violates free trade
principles and international law.
</P>
<P>
Even Britain, which is the closest ally of the U.S., is also
strongly opposed to the law.
</P>
<P>
Eizenstat said that campaign against the Cuban government
would not be "strengthened by the institution of lawsuits."
"We must have the cooperation of our allies,"he added.

<HEADLINE> US Industrial Production Up 0.3 Percent in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The industrial production at
the U.S. factories, mines and utilities rose by a moderate 0.3
percent in June following a 0.2 percent gain in May, the U.S.
Federal Reserve (Fed) reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the increase was mainly resulted from the
gain in the production of durable goods.
</P>
<P>
Paced by another sharp increase in the production of durable
consumer goods, the overall output of consumer goods rose 0.3
percent in the month with a 4 percent increase of vehicle. The
production of appliances and home computing equipment also posed
strong increase. The production of nondurable goods other than
energy products was flat and little changed from the previous
month.
</P>
<P>
For the second quarter as a whole, industrial production in the
U.S. grew at an annual rate of 4.3 percent, about the same rate as
in the previous two quarters.
</P>
<P>
The Fed report said that the output of construction supplies
fell by 0.4 percent in June and manufacturing output increased by
0.3 percent after identical increases in April and May.
</P>
<P>
In June, capacity utilization in the nation held steady at 83.5
percent. Economists believe an operating rate of 84 percent or
higher signals the development of inflationary bottlenecks in the
production pipeline.

<HEADLINE> Kagame Defends Congo on UN Investigation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Rwandan Vice-President and
Defense Minister Paul Kagame today defended Congolese President
Laurent Kabila's conditions for a U.N. investigation into alleged
massacres of Hutu refugees.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference at the end of a one-day visit to
Kenya here, the Rwandan strong man said the investigation team
has to be neutral and that the probe had to be widened to cover a
longer period than that envisaged by the U.N.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that civilians in the eastern part of former Zaire
were routinely slaughtered by Rwandan Hutu refugees and
militiamen and this also warranted a U.N. investigation.
</P>
<P>
Kagame, whose National Patriotic Front rebels seized power in
Rwanda in 1994, admitted last week that Rwanda sent troops to
help Kabila topple President Mobutu Sese Seko in former Zaire,
now Democratic Congo, but Kabila said only Rwandan advisers had
been in his army.
</P>
<P>
"Kabila is demanding a wider scope of investigation into
killings in the Kivu region before and after he took power. I do
not see anything wrong in that," said Kagame.
</P>
<P>
Kagame said Kabila also wants neutral people to be members of
the probe and not just individuals who have formulated opinions
on the alleged killings.
</P>
<P>
U.N. chief Kofi Annan will soon name a new team to fly to
Kinshasa to probe the massacre reports after Kabila blocked an
inquiry led by Roberto Garreton of Chile.
</P>
<P>
Kagame came to Nairobi to mend fences with Kenya. He described
his talks with Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi as "cordial and
very fruitful", saying they have agreed to reopen the Rwandan
embassy in Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
The Rwandan embassy was shut down a year ago after a Rwandan
diplomat was implicated in an attempted assassination of an
exiled Rwandan Hutu politician in Nairobi. Kigali had then
accused Nairobi of helping Hutu dissidents who led, took part or
planned Rwanda's 1994 genocide of more than half a million
people.

TEHRAN, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Hashemi
Rafsanjani's entourage escaped unhurt as their helicopter
crash-landed soon after taking off today in Kerman, 660 kilometers
southeast of Tehran.
</P>
<P>
According to the official news agency IRNA, the chopper, which
developed a technical problem, came to an emergency landing and
suffered slight damages.
</P>
<P>
Those on board included Rafsanjani's son Mohsen Hashemi, who is
head of the Presidential Office, Parliament Member Hussein
Mar'ashi and a high-ranking official from the office of
President-elect Mohammad Khatami.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani, who was currently touring Kerman province, was not
on board the helicopter, the report said.
</P>
<P>

telephone.
</P>
<P>
The news agency said that the incident took place after the
inauguration of a leaching process unit of the Sarcheshmeh Copper
Complex in Kerman province.

the incident, the report said.

ATHENS, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Greece today put a
large amount of funds in the country's foreign exchange market in
an effort to defend the Greek drachma, which came under pressure

<HEADLINE> Turkey Slams EU Membership Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Turkey today criticized a European
Commission's recommendation to start the European Union (EU)
membership talks with six countries but Turkey.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by Turkish Foreign Ministry said the
European Commission's decision to keep Turkey outside the
membership talks reflected "a discriminative and wrong approach."
</P>
<P>
"This approach contradicts with the EU commitment to equal and
objective standards applied to all candidate countries," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission agreed Tuesday to recommend six
nations, including Cyprus, Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary,
Slovenia and Estonia, for a first wave of EU entry talks.
</P>
<P>
The exclusion of Turkey in the EU membership talks is
considered as an blow to Turkey's drive for full EU membership.
</P>
<P>
The statement also described the European Commission's
recommendation of Cyprus for the membership negotiations as "an
unjust choice."
</P>
<P>
In accordance with an agreement between the two countries in
1960, Cyprus could not participate in any international
organizations in which Turkey was not a member state.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus was divided into Turkish Cypriot North and Greek Cypriot
South When Turkish troops landed and took control of the northern
third of the island in 1974 following a coup seeking union with
Greece.
</P>
<P>
Turkish President Suleyman Demirel and Deputy Prime Minister
Bulent Ecevit also expressed their dissatisfaction with the
European Commission's recommendation while meeting with a senior
official from northern Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Demirel warned that the inclusion of Cyprus in the future EU
membership talks would bring a negative impact on the ongoing
Cyprus negotiations held between Cypriot President Glafcos
Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash in New York.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit threatened that Turkey and northern Cyprus would speed
up their integration process if the EU did not change its stance.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has been striving for a full EU membership in a bid to
give a big push to its economy, but failed to achieve this goal
due to a number of controversial issues with the EU.
</P>
<P>
European nations have cited Turkey's weak economy and human
rights record as hurdles for its pursuit of EU membership
application.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Refuses to Recognize Cambodia's New Co-premier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The United States said on
Wednesday that it would not recognize a replacement of First Prime
Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh, which was reportedly decided by
a faction of his FUNCINPEC party this morning.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns told reporters the
United States was "very concerned" about the decision to make
Cambodian Foreign Minister Ung Huot Cambodia's co-prime minister
on Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
Ranariddh was overthrown by Second Prime Minister Hun Sen on
July 6 after Hun Sen moved his troops to make fierce attack on the
troops loyal to Prince Ranariddh and forced him into exile.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen later said he wanted to keep the coalition between his
Cambodian People's Party and Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC in place and
required FUNCINPEC to choose a new first prime minister, hence
came the reported decision by the FUNCINPEC faction.
</P>
<P>
"We see no evidence whatsoever that FUNCINPEC has met... and
has elected on a free basis... a successor to Prince Ranariddh,"
Burns said at a briefing.
</P>
<P>
"We urge the authorities in Phnom Penh to refrain from
announcing a new first prime minister until Prince Ranariddh's
political party has an opportunity to make a reasoned decision on
this matter, free of coercion, free of intimidation," he
continued.
</P>
<P>
Burns said the United States had dealt "very cooperatively"
with Ung Huot as foreign minister in the past, "but we don't
recognize him as first prime minister, we recognize Prince
Ranariddh as first prime minister."

<HEADLINE> Kenya Liberalizes Agricultural Commodity Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Kenya launched its Agricultural
Commodity Exchange (KACE) here today to enhance the
liberalization of commodity marketing in the country.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the launching ceremony held here this evening,
Darius Mbela, Minister for Agriculture, Livestock Development and
Marketing said that KACE is a "viable private sector initiative".
</P>
<P>
Following the launching of KACE and its trading floor, the
minister said, "Our farmers are now free to sell their produce to
markets of their choice."
</P>
<P>
When the government withdrew from participation in commodity
marketing in the process of economic liberalization, farmers have
been left with no guaranteed markets as before.
</P>
<P>
In view of this situation, Mbela noted that his government is
committed to the reforms which encourage the private sector to
play its proper role not only in production but also in the
marketing of the commodities.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, KACE can provide a market for
farmers to sell their produce as well as the needed information
to guide them in their plans to produce.
</P>
<P>
"The farmer and the consumer can meet and strike out fair
deals between them, guided by the true forces of supply and
demand on the market to set the fair prices," he stated.
</P>
<P>
On the same occasion, Adrian Mukhebi, Executive Chairman of
KACE, pointed out that the KACE was aimed at providing a market
where sellers and buyers of commodities can meet to trade, and
providing current market information to assist the sellers and
buyers in making more profitable decisions.
</P>
<P>
Once the Nairobi Trade Floor is fully operational, Mukhebi
said, KACE shall establish regional branches in different parts
of the country, to be connected by a modern communication
network.
</P>
<P>
He said that KACE had plans to spread its service to eastern
and southern African markets once commodity exchanges are also
established there.
</P>
<P>
Agricultural commodities will be traded at the KACE trading
floor for immediate delivery and in forward contract and futures'
markets for delivery at later dates.
</P>
<P>
The trading days have been set for Tuesdays, Thursdays and
Saturdays from 10.00 a.m. to 2.00 p.m.
</P>
<P>
KACE will start a web site home page on the internet which
will enable it to have access to information and commodities on
world markets and vice versa.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe
today called for the development of indigenous languages, saying
this is vital of enhancing participatory democracy.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe, who was officially opening a three-day annual
conference and workshop of the Zimbabwe Languages Association
here, said indigenous languages should be used in all social,
political and economic pursuits.
</P>
<P>
He said, ''We as a nation must chart the way forward in order
to uplift the status, standard, and functional capacity of our
indigenous languages.''
</P>
<P>
''Failing to achieve this will bring the entire concept of
participatory democracy in Zimbabwe into question,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
He said the present and the future of indigenous languages
was, in fact, the present and future of local people.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said, ''We cannot treat indigenous languages as if they
are dead or dying, relegating them to mere cadavers of linguistic
glory that once was.''
</P>
<P>
He noted that some people in Zimbabwe have tended, either
explicitly or implicitly, to despise indigenous languages in
which the country's culture is rooted.
</P>
<P>
The president appealed to the news media to take indigenous
languages seriously. ''Extensive use of our indigenous languages
will ensure that our people are better informed on all issues
that concern them and the nation as a whole,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
The event followed the language association's first annual
conference and workshop held in December last year, which
formulated a blueprint ''Mission Statement of the Zimbabwe
Languages Association on the Language Policy of Zimbabwe''.

<HEADLINE> Negotiators Urged to Speed up Talks on Financial Services </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of Committee on Trade in
Financial Services in the World Trade Organization (WTO) Yoshio
Okubo has urged negotiators to continue to make efforts in order
to finish the talks by December 12, 1997 as scheduled, trade
sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
"Time is limited. Delegations should work hard," Okubo told
negotiators from WTO members, who began the negotiations on
financial services on April 10, 1997.
</P>
<P>
The negotiators hope to improve upon the package of
market-opening commitments agreed in July 1995, and to apply these
commitments equally, without discrimination, among all their
trading partners.
</P>
<P>
This would continue the process of progressive liberalization
that is one of the stated objectives of the General Agreement on
Trade in Services (GATS).
</P>
<P>
As of July 17, 1997, 26 members, including the 15 European
Union members, have submitted new offers. These members are
Australia, Bahrain, Canada, the EU members, Hong Kong, Hungary,
Japan, Norway, the Slovak Republic, Switzerland, Turkey, and the
United States, according to trade sources in Geneva. The offers
are conditional and subject to the overall outcome of the
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Since the package of market-opening commitments went into
effect on January 1, 1995, 96 members have made financial services
commitments in their Uruguay Round services schedules. As many as
43 of the 96 have improved their financial services commitments in
negotiations which ended on July 28, 1995.
</P>
<P>
Further meetings of the committee are planned for September,
October and November with a final meeting scheduled for December
12, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Brazil, the Czech Republic, Egypt, Israel, Macao, New Zealand,
Peru, Poland, Romania, and South Korea have said that they may
submit their offers by September.

<HEADLINE> West China Development Network Center Set Up in Yinchuan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The headquarters of a development
network for west China was established today in Yinchuan, the
capital of northwest China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the network, which was founded by economic
development pilot areas, is to develop new industries, expand
co-operation in the West, and build a "western science and
technology corridor".
</P>
<P>
Another function is to try to increase co-operation between
western and eastern parts of China and to bring in more foreign
funds.
</P>
<P>
The West includes Chongqing Municipality, formerly in Sichuan
province; Shaanxi, Gansu, Sichuan, Qinghai, and Guizhou provinces;
and the autonomous regions of Ningxia, Xinjiang, Tibet, and
Guangxi. It covers an area of about 57 million sq kilometers, or
58.4 percent of the China's total area, and has more than 40
million ethnic minority people, or 55 percent of the country's
total. It shares 13,000 km of border line with 14 other countries.
</P>
<P>
The network is expected to help high-tech industries in west
China and hopefully help turn the area from a poverty-stricken area
into a prosperous one, according to Xu Guanhua, vice-minister in
charge of the State Science and Technology Commission.

<HEADLINE> AL Slams U.S. Stance on Palestinian Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Saeed Kamal, Arab League Assistant
Secretary General for Palestinian Affairs, today denounced a U.S.
tendency to sidestep international resolutions on Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Egyptian MENA news agency, he warned a
recent spate of academic studies in the U.S. "try to depict the
settling of Palestinians in other countries as the sole and
feasible option for solving the problem of Palestinian refugees."
</P>
<P>
He complained that the bulk of that research was intended to
skirt international resolutions in this regard.
</P>
<P>
"It is aimed at absolving Israel of any responsibility for the
issue and rephrasing the problem as merely one of rationing out
Palestinians between Israel and Arab countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
He warned that this would mean "depriving the Palestinians of
the right to return to their land."
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Washington voted against the UN General Assembly
resolution that condemns Israel's failure to stop the construction
of 6,500 homes for Jews in East Jerusalem, which the Palestinians
want as their future capital.
</P>
<P>
It had blocked two similar UN resolutions since Israel broke
ground for the Har Homa project, plunging the Mideast peacemaking
into four months of crisis.
</P>
<P>
On the current situation in the Mideast, Kamal charged that
Israel continues to place hurdles in front of the peace drive by
adopting a policy of "scuttling and ultimately destroying the
entire process," in defiance of Arab efforts to breathe life into
it.
</P>
<P>
"Israel's intensive settlement activity in East Jerusalem is
part of an ethnic cleansing campaign against the Palestinians that
strips off their identities and throws them out of Jerusalem to
manipulate the demographic structure of the holy city," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Arab League official said Israel's continued closure of
Palestinian lands and sapping of Palestinian economic resources,
specially water, have taken their heavy toll of Palestinian
economy that is already dilapidated by long years of occupation.
</P>
<P>
Kamal called for ensuring support for the Palestinian economy
especially by regional and international groups.

<P>
WASHINGTON, July 17 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Space shuttle Columbia
with its crew of seven returned to Earth Thursday with a bounty of
laboratory research on fire, metals and plants.
</P>
<P>
NASA's oldest shuttle glided through a clear, flushed sky and
touched down just after sunrise at Kennedy Space Center in Florida
following a 16-day journey, according to media reports.
</P>
<P>
The crew's first stab at the mission three months ago ended
prematurely because of equipment trouble.
</P>
<P>
This first-ever reflight, which began July 1 and cost NASA
between 60 million to 70 million U.S. dollars, experienced hardly
any equipment trouble. The April mission was cut short after only
four days because of a faulty power generator.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Military Planes Return From Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Three Japanese military transport
planes returned home today after aborting their controversial
mission to fly to Cambodia to evacuate Japanese nationals.
</P>
<P>
The three C-130H transport aircraft from Japan's Air
Self-Defense Force (ASDF), which left the U-Taphao naval base 175
kilometers southeast of Bangkok earlier today, arrived back in
Japan's southernmost island prefecture of Okinawa, press reports
here said.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto decided Wednesday
night to withdraw the three ASDF transport planes from Thailand,
saying the violence in Cambodia had diminished and no longer
threatened Japanese nationals there.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto's decision to bring home the three ASDF planes came
six days after the prime minister dispatched the transport planes
to the U-Taphao naval base.
</P>
<P>
The planes and the ASDF had been waiting for orders since
Saturday for possible rescue operations to get Japanese nationals
out of Cambodia which was gripped by fighting between troops loyal
to Second Prime Minister Hun Sen who ousted his rival, First Prime
Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh, last week.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto's decision to dispatch the military planes came under
criticism from some officials at the Foreign Ministry and the
Defense Agency.
</P>
<P>
"There is no law that provides a legal basis for sending the
planes to Thailand," one irritated Foreign Ministry official was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Takako Doi, leader of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) -- one
of two non-cabinet allies of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party
(LDP), also criticized the dispatch and said it had no legal
foundation.
</P>
<P>
To make things worse for Hashimoto, the Cambodian government
said Monday that it would not allow the Japanese planes to enter
Cambodia, noting that commercial airlines had resumed service.

<HEADLINE> Saddam Asks for Lifting of U.N. Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
here today asked the U.N. Security Council to lift the
seven-year-old sanctions imposed against Iraq since its invasion
of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
In a nationally-televised speech marking Iraq's 29th National
Day, Saddam said his country has "fulfilled its obligations under
the Security Council resolutions on eliminating weapons of mass
destruction."
</P>
<P>
"It is utterly unacceptable that the Security Council should
not acknowledge these sacrifices of Iraq and, in turn, fulfill its
obligations by lifting the embargo once and for all, completely
and comprehensively," he said.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been seeking the lifting of the sanctions, which
forbid it selling oil and have inflicted devastating sufferings to
its people. However, the sanctions can only be lifted after a
U.N. special commission proves Iraq's full compliance in giving up
weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
The president attacked the U.S. for intending to prolong the
sanctions against his country in order to "continue to kill the
Iraqis by denying them food and medicine."
</P>
<P>
In an "oil-for-food" deal with the U.N., Iraq was allowed the
sale of 2 billion U.S. dollars worth of oil in a six-month period
for direly needed food and medicine. But it said its contracts
with foreign companies were repeatedly blocked by the U.S., thus
turning the deal into "oil-for-nothing."
</P>
<P>
Saddam said Iraq's relations with the U.N. Security Council
"will not stabilize unless the Security Council respects Iraq's
sovereignty and national security as it has stated and stressed in
its relevant resolutions."
</P>
<P>
He said "there is no way to stabilize the relations between the
U.N. Special Commission and its (Iraq's) concerns over its
national security and avoid provocations and manipulation."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. weapons inspection team has accused Baghdad of denying
its entry into delicate and sensitive sites and hiding weapons
that should have been scrapped.
</P>
<P>
As for the Palestine issue, Saddam appealed for Arab unity in
supporting the Palestinian cause and demanded Israel's
unconditional withdrawal from all occupied Arab territories.
</P>
<P>
The president condemned Turkish military operations in northern
Iraq aimed at wiping out Kurdish rebels and urged Ankara to
cooperate with neighboring states to ensure border security.
</P>
<P>
He deemed the military cooperation between Turkey and Israel as
a threat to the security of Iraq and the region as a whole.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Saddam also criticized Iran's hostile policy
against Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Canada's CPI Up 1.8 Percent on Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Canadian consumers paid 1.8 percent
more than in June they did a year earlier for the goods and
services contained in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) basket,
Statistics Canada reported today.
</P>
<P>
The increase was primarily related to higher prices for such
big-budget items as new vehicles, vehicle insurance, clothing and
postsecondary tuition.
</P>
<P>
"However, Canadian consumers paid substantially less in
mortgage interest payments," the federal statistics agency said.
</P>
<P>
June's annual rate of CPI change was slightly higher than
April's (1.7 percent) and May's (1.5 percent), but lower than the
rates in the five preceding months (2.0 percent to 2.2 percent).
</P>
<P>
In monthly terms, the CPI rose by 0.2 percent in June. Higher
traveler accommodation rates had the most impact, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
Other price increases were noted for food, gasoline, air travel
and a number of personal-care products. Clothing and recreational
equipment prices declined, it added.

MOSCOW, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Nine people were killed, dozens
injured and five were still trapped under rubble today after a
military school dormitory in western Siberia collapsed, reports
said.
</P>
<P>
About 150 people, most of them cadets, were in the three-story
building of the Tomsk Military Communications School in the city
of Tomsk when the roof collapsed five minutes before the wake-up
call at 6 a.m. local time.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 60 people were taken to hospital and 10 were in critical
condition. Five were still trapped several hours after the
accident and rescue workers had to clear the rubble with their
bare hands. Reports said their chances of survival were slim.
</P>
<P>
The building was old and had not been repaired since the early
1950s when it was converted from a monastery into a dormitory. A
third story was later constructed on top of the two original
levels, Itar-Tass reported.

HARBIN, July 17 (Xinhua) -- State Councillor Chen Junsheng

responsibility system.

<P>
During his inspection in northeast China's Heilongjiang

</P>
<P>
The household-based contract responsibility system, initiated
in east China's Anhui province in 1979, was spread all over the
country in two years. It was a break from the state-ownership and
helped boost the country's annual grain output from 300 billion kg
in late 1970s to 490 billion kg in 1996.

Ministry of Forestry.
</P>
<P>
China's afforestation drive depends largely on the supply of
tree seeds and young seedlings. According to the source, about 82
percent of tree seeds and 85 percent of seedlings are suitable for
planting.
</P>
<P>
In the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, which is famous for
its melons and other fruits, six new apricot strains have
reportedly increased apricot output four to five times.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Forestry said that since 1993, China has been
successful in improving more than 1,000 various tree species.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry has also issued 31 statements of standards for
tree seed and seedling production.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Guangyao, Vice-Minister of Forestry, said that in the near
future China will build another 30 seed centers and 50 nurseries
for seedlings.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest Ministry of Forestry plan, by the year
2000, China's forest coverage will reach 15.5 percent, and its
urban green coverage will reach 30 percent.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Ends First Terrorism Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, July 17 (Xinhua) -- A Vietnamese court in Ho Chi Minh
City sentenced two men to death and three to life imprisonment
Tuesday in the country's first ever terrorism trial, the local
press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Huynh Te Cam, 39, and Tran Van Thuan, 29, were given the death
penalty for throwing grenades into a crowd at Bach Dang Wharf in
Ho Chi Minh City on October 13, 1994, which wounded 18 people,
including nine foreigners.
</P>
<P>
They were arrested on June 9, 1996 when they tried to enter
Vietnam at the Moc Bai border entry point with Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
Truong Van Duy, Pham Xuan Than and Nguyen Si Bang were
sentenced to life in prison for helping to organize the attack
which was designed to frighten foreign tourists and businessmen
and destabilize the country.
</P>
<P>
The five defendants belong to an exiled organization called the
"Resistance Front for the Restoration of Vietnam."
</P>
<P>
The organization has allegedly sent threatening letters to
foreigners telling them to stop investment and business in Vietnam
and leave the country as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The organization also reportedly attempted to undermine the
eighth congress of the Communist Party of Vietnam which was held
in June last year.

<HEADLINE> Gulf Air Cuts Debts to 923 Million Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Gulf Air has sharply cut its
debts to 923 million U.S. dollars by the end of June from 1.566
billion dollars in December 1995, a statement issued by the
regional carrier said today.
</P>
<P>
A further reduction is anticipated before the end of 1997, the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
The Bahrain-based airline jointly owned by the governments of
Bahrain, Oman, Qatar and Abu Dhabi Emirate of the United Arab
Emirates (UAE) did not reveal its debts in 1996, but informed
sources said its debts amounted to an estimated 2 billion dollars
by the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
The debts, mostly in bank loans, resulted from a flurry of
buying new aircraft in the late 1980s and opening uneconomic
routes, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The debt-ridden carrier has cut jobs, sold aircraft and closed
unprofitable routes to cut losses.
</P>
<P>
At the end of 1996, the airline has sold six Boeing 767
aircraft and closed routes to and from New York, Geneva and
Johannesburg.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 17 (Xinhua) -- India's newly elected President
Kocheril Raman Narayanan was born on February 4, 1921 in Uzhavoor
village of Kerala state in far southwestern India. He was once
barred from school for not being able to pay his fees.
</P>
<P>
After graduating from university, he took up a job in the
central secretariat as an assistant. But after a few weeks, he
resigned and worked for the weekly "Commerce and Industry".
</P>
<P>
Then he went to Britain to continue his study. When he came
back, he has been a pen-pusher, teacher, journalist, diplomat,
vice chancellor, union minister and vice president.
</P>
<P>
Narayanan served in Indian embassies in Vietnam and Australia
and as ambassador in Thailand, Turkey and China. He retired from
the foreign service in 1978 and entered politics later. After
being elected a member of Parliament, he was appointed by Rajiv
Gandhi as minister of state for planning.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, he was chosen as a candidate for vice presidency and
was elected almost unanimously with just one vote cast against
him.

<HEADLINE> Toy Tariff Hike Barely Affects HK Exports to Brazil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Brazil's safeguard measures on
toys show little impact on Hong Kong's total exports to the South
American country, said the Hong Kong Trade Development Council
(TDC) today.
</P>
<P>
A TDC report said Brazil's stable economy will stimulate import
demand for other products. This should more than offset the
negative impact of the tariff hike.
</P>
<P>
From January 1, 1997 to December 1999, Brazil will impose
additional duties on some categories of imported toys, and the
revised total tariff rate will be 63 percent in 1997, 49 percent
in 1998 and 35 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Although the safeguard measures will seriously hamper Hong
Kong's toy exports to Brazil, they only slightly affect Hong
Kong's overall exports to Brazil, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Figures showed that affected toys account for less than one
percent of Hong Kong's overall domestic exports to Brazil and 9.2
percent of its re-exports.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few years, Hong Kong exports to Brazil have grown
rapidly. Total exports to Brazil more than tripled between 1993
and 1995. Following a five percent drop in 1996, Hong Kong exports
to Brazil recorded an increase of 33 percent during the first four
months of this year, reaching 2.85 billion HK dollars (365.38
Million U.S. dollars).

</P>
<P>
Cholera and osteomyelitis, which had not been reported in

<HEADLINE> China Issues Circular On Purchasing Grain At Protective Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 17 (Xinhua) -- China's Grain Reserve
Administration has issued a circular calling on local grain
purchasing departments to buy grain from farmers at protective
grain prices and without limits.
</P>
<P>
Open-ended grain purchasing at protective prices is a key
government measure to protect farmers' benefits, increase their
income, and protect farmers' enthusiasm in grain production, the
circular explains.
</P>
<P>
There are more than 900 million farmers in China, and the
income from grain production is a major means of improving their
lives and of increasing production.
</P>
<P>
If grain production worsens, the general economic development
and social stability will be affected, it pointed out, adding
that this decision by the central government shows the stability
of the state's agricultural policy, which will benefit farmers for
a long time to come.
</P>
<P>
As a major part of the grain circulation system, state-run
grain departments should strictly adhere to the central
government's grain-purchasing policy, and buy farmers' extra grain
without IOUs, the circular said.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The Turkish military has launched a
probe to find out if former deputy Prime Minister Tansu Ciller
works for the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), all the
local newspapers reported today.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Chief of General Staff Ismail Hakki Karaday has given
an order to the military public prosecutor's office to make such
an investigation against Ciller, who is also leader of the True
Path Party, the newspapers said.
</P>
<P>
If found guilty of espionage, Ciller would face a trial in the
supreme court, said the reports.
</P>
<P>
The spying allegations against Ciller were first made in late
June by Worker's Party Chairman Dogu Perincek who claimed Ciller
has been working for the CIA since 1967.
</P>
<P>
Perincek accused Ciller, also former foreign minister, in a
petition to the prosecutor of "accepting money and benefits from
foreigners with the intention of acting against the national
interests".
</P>
<P>
Perincek also said that Ciller received training by the CIA
and that she had been active on behalf of the CIA in the former
Soviet Union and in Libya.

BEIJING, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Foreign Ministry Spokesman Tang

the Korean peninsula and believes that a worsening of the
situation there is not in the interest of the parties concerned.
</P>

<HEADLINE> New Chemical Fertilizer Plant For Northwest China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Gansu Province
will have a greater supply of chemical fertilizer when a new
chemical fertilizer plant goes operational at the Lanzhou Chemical
Industry Corp. (LCIC) in August.
</P>
<P>
The plant will use residual oil to produce 300,000 tons of
synthetic ammonia and 520,000 tons of carbamide annually for grain
production, according to Zhu Lianbao, general manager of the
company.
</P>
<P>
Chemical fertilizers play a vital role in increasing Gansu's
grain output, but because of short supplies, the average amount of
chemical fertilizers applied in Gansu is about 75 percent lower
than the national average.
</P>
<P>
"The shortage of chemical fertilizer has become a drag on the
province's agricultural production," Governor Sun Ying explains.
</P>
<P>
The new plant is actually an expansion project at an old LCIC
plant. Gansu and the Chinese Petrochemical Corp (Sinopec) have
spent more than 2.8 billion yuan (337 million US dollars) on the
project.
</P>
<P>
"We imported advanced equipment and technology from Germany,
the U.S., and Italy in order to enhance automation and to reduce
the consumption of energy and the discharge of industrial waste,"
Zhu said, pointing out that expanding production capacity of an
old factory in this way is more economical than building a new one.
</P>
<P>
The success of the chemical fertilizer project will be an
example of renovation in this west China's petrochemical giant
with its 45 major plants producing more than 110 kinds of
products, such as chemical fertilizers, synthetic rubbers,
synthetic fibers and petroleum products.
</P>
<P>
"After decades of operation, the company needs an overall
technological renovation to improve production conditions and
increase economic efficiency," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The company is planning to expand its ethylene production
capacity to satisfy the growing demand for agriculture-related
materials in northwest and southwest China, including plastic
sheeting and plastic pipe for irrigation.
</P>
<P>
"New ethylene projects will not only help us expand the
business, but also spur the local economic growth since related
industries will be developed," Zhu said.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Senior Official Praises China News Agency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Kenya is very happy to see that
China's news reporting on the eastern African country "is
balanced and have no bias," said Kenyan Minister for Information
and Broadcasting Johnstone Makau today.
</P>
<P>
This forms a sharp contrast with western media which paints a
"very negative picture" of Kenya and a lot of other African
countries, he said, adding that such a picture damaged the image
of the continent and reduced the foreign arrivals.
</P>
<P>
Xinhua News Agency, China's official new agency which has set
a branch here for more than 20 years, covers news in balance for
Kenya and other developing nations with "no wrong pictures
given," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan minister spoke highly of the long-term sound
cooperation between Xinhua and the Kenyan News Agency (KNA) at a
ceremony at which the Xinhua donated equipment worth some 1.5
million Shillings (28,000 U.S. Dollars) was handed over to KNA.
</P>
<P>
The donation to KNA, Kenya's national news service founded in
1963, included computers, printers, cameras, facsimile machines
and other telecommunication equipment.
</P>
<P>
A big scheme has been underway to modernize KNA with
up-to-date information technology, he said, expressing the hope
that China can help more as KNA-Xinhua cooperation deepens during
KNA's modernization process.
</P>
<P>
He said that China has continuously offered technical
assistance to Kenya in social, cultural and other fields over
recent years.
</P>
<P>
"The bilateral relations existing between Kenya and China are
very very cordial and very warm," he added.
</P>
<P>
In response, Chinese Ambassador An Yongyu said China attaches
importance to its relations with Kenya and is satisfied with the
recent smooth and fruitful development of ties through the
exchanges of visits by top leaders of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"We are helping each other sincerely and we hope we can do
more," An said.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Liberal Democratic Party Leader on Sino-Japanese Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The secretary-general of Japan's
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), Kato Koichi, told the Chinese
Press here today that Japan and China should strengthen dialogue,
establish relations of mutual trust, and joint efforts to enter a
new century of peace and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Kato, who is in Beijing as guest of the Communist Party of
China (CPC), said that one of the purposes of his visit is to
discuss bilateral relations and a wide range of international
issues with Chinese leaders, and to carry a message on Japan's
determination for peaceful development and Sino-Japanese
friendship.
</P>
<P>
This visit has been fruitful in that co-operative relations
between the ruling parties of the two countries have been
reaffirmed, he explained.
</P>
<P>
Japan and China normalized diplomatic relations 25 years ago
and bilateral ties have grown smoothly on the whole, he noted. In
the past decade or so, economic and trade co-operation has become
better, but political contacts have not had enough emphasis,
something that has resulted in some problems.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, it is time for the two countries to make a decision
to expand co-operation, especially between young politicians, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
He pointed to Japan's spirit of deep introspection for the
untold suffering it caused the people of Asia, something that was
explained by former Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama in his speech
two years ago.
</P>
<P>
Some people in Japan are calling for a re-definition of
historical issues, but they are in the minority, Kato said,
expressing his hope that both sides will reach an agreement on
this point through discussions and consultations.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Officials Told to Use Cars Within State Standards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 17 (Xinhua) -- China's Central Commission for
Discipline Inspection and the Ministry of Supervision have issued
a circular urging officials to stop using cars that are better
than called for in their work.
</P>
<P>
The circular comes at a time when the Guangdong Provincial
Commission for Discipline Inspection and the province's Supervision
Department are dealing with three cases involving local officials
buying cars that exceeded standards set by the central government.
</P>
<P>
In early 1994, officials with the provincial Education
Commission there bought two Crown Toyota cars with 826,000 yuan
(99,500 US dollars), 796,000 yuan of which had been intended for
educational funds.
</P>
<P>
Six officials, including Xu Renzhi, director of the Education
Commission, were given Party disciplinary warnings, and the two
cars were confiscated and auctioned.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Xuchuan and Yang Chunyi, general manager and deputy
general manager respectively of the Agricultural Machinery
Corporation in Heping County of Heyuan City, Guangdong, were
removed from their posts and given Party discipline for buying a
Volkswagen Santana and two mobile phones with 244,000 yuan in
poverty-relief loans in January.
</P>
<P>
The third case involves Liao Bin, vice-mayor of Qingyuan
County, and is still under investigation. Liao used a Crown Toyota
that exceeded state standards from January to March of this year.
</P>
<P>
The circular points out that the Communist Party of China
Central Committee and the State Council have worked out a
series of decrees on the use of cars by officials, but some
officials have ignored these regulations.
</P>
<P>
It calls on officials to learn from these cases under review,
and they are reminded that those found violating the decrees will
be severely penalized.

YAOUNDE, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The first ordinary session of the
National Assembly of Cameroun for the 1997/1998 legislative year
came to a close in Yaounde last night after parliamentarians
adopted a total of five bills presented by the Camerounian
government.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the closing ceremony, the state budget for the
1997/1998 fiscal year which stands at 1256 billion CFA francs was

</P>
<P>
The budget shows an increase of 13 percent on the 1996/1997
estimate.
</P>
<P>
Opened on June 17, the first ordinary session had validated

<HEADLINE> Australian Workers in Arts Poorly Paid: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Half a million Australians, or 7
percent of the country's work force, earn some income from
arts-related work although most professionals are poorly paid
despite high qualifications, said a report released here today.
</P>
<P>
Margaret Seares, who was newly appointed chairwoman of the
Australia Council, said Artswork, a report on Australians working
in the arts, showed the days were gone when arts was correctly
described as a fringe area.
</P>
<P>
"Sadly, artists remain among the most poorly paid professionals
in the country despite a level of education nearly double the
national average," she said.
</P>
<P>
Of the most recent figures available (1992-1993), the average
income for artists remains at only about 15,000 U.S. dollars and
in some arts professions such as dance the average income is as
low as 9,000 U.S. dollars, Seares said.
</P>
<P>
By comparison, the average income for the whole work force is
24,300 U.S. dollars in para-professional occupations, and 28,100
U.S. dollars in managerial occupations.
</P>
<P>
The report, the result of research by the Australian Bureau of
Statistics and work by Australia's leading arts researcher David
Throsby, covers work in a diverse range of cultural and leisure
activities, including museums, art galleries and libraries to
radio, television, film, design, photography, jewelry, writing,
publishing, visual arts and performing arts as well as people who
were ticket sellers, ushers or stage hands.
</P>
<P>
Of the half million Australians earning some income from arts
work, the biggest group are in writing or publishing (133,000),
followed by arts teaching (120,000) and music performance
(67,000).
</P>
<P>
"There are about 40,000 practicing professional artists working
full time or part time in an expanding arts sector," Seares said.
</P>
<P>
The arts work force increased by a phenomenal 23 percent in the
late 1980s, when the total work force grew just 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
The report says most arts workers live and work in the major
capital cities, while Sydney has 32 percent of all the workers.
</P>
<P>
The average age of practicing professional artists is 44,
compared with the work force average of 37, with writers tending
to be older (on average 54), visual artists (44), and dancers the
youngest group at 26.
</P>
<P>
About 60 percent of people whose main job is in the arts are
men, but the breakup of the sexes is very different in particular
areas.
</P>
<P>
Eighty percent of Australia's announcers are men, 74 percent of
the musicians are men, while 51 percent of authors are women, as
are 67 percent of dancers and choreographers.

<HEADLINE> Indian PM Cancels Visit to Malaysia, Singapore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 17 (Xinhua)-- Indian Prime Minister Inder Kumar
Gujral has canceled his proposed visit to Malaysia and Singapore
beginning on July 26, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Gujral, in his capacity as minister of external affairs, was
scheduled to visit Kuala Lumpur to attend the foreign ministerial
meeting of the Asean Regional Forum (ARF) and stop over in
Singapore for two days on his way home.
</P>
<P>
Official sources here said that the prime minister canceled his
trip because the vice-presidential election would be held on
August 16.
</P>
<P>
But some observers here believed that the reason behind the
decision was that the prime minister had to first put in order his
crisis-ridden United Front.
</P>
<P>
Following the split of the Janata Dal, the largest constituent
of the ruling United Front, earlier this month, another major
constituent, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), on Monday
threatened to withdraw from the 13-party front.
</P>
<P>
The DMK in a statement accused some United Front leaders of
pursuing personal agenda at the cost of the unity of the front.
This referred to the insistence by former prime minister H.D. Deve
Gowda and the left parties that the breakaway wing of the Janata
Dal, led by Bihar Chief Minister Laloo Prasad Yadav, be kept out
of the ruling front.
</P>
<P>
Laloo Prasad Yadav, who was former Janata Dal president and a
rival of former prime minister Gowda, has been charged in a
scandal in which huge sums of public funds for purchasing fodder
have been embezzled in Bihar.
</P>
<P>
Gowda and the left parties, among others, have been pressing
Yadav to resign from the post of Bihar chief minister, resulting
in the split of the Janata Dal.
</P>
<P>
Yadav, who floated the Rashtriya Janata Party in defiance of
pressure for him to quit, has voiced support to the Gujral
government and wanted to stay in the United Front.
</P>
<P>
The DMK will take a final decision on its withdrawal on July 27
unless the parties concerned within the United Front can iron out
their differences before that date.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Saudi Aramco Signs Deal on Joint Venture with US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, July 17 (Xinhua) -- A state-owned Saudi oil
company has signed a memorandum of understanding with two
U.S. oil companies to form a new three-partner joint venture to
market gasoline and other refined oil products.
</P>
<P>
This was announced Wednesday night by the Saudi Arabian Oil
Company (Saudi Aramco) in the Saudi city of Dhahranin in a press
release, which was reported by the Saudi Press Agency.
</P>
<P>
The new venture of Aramco and Shell as well as Texaco
Incorporation would sell products under both the Texaco and Shell
brands through existing outlets.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi Aramco is the world's largest oil-producing company,
with integrated operations in exploration, production, refining
and marketing.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi Aramco's initial ownership interest in the new joint
venture, Eastern Region Company, will be 32.5 percent, with 32.5
percent held by Texaco and 35 percent by Shell, the release
said.
</P>
<P>
The chief executives of the three companies said in a joint
statement that "we believe this combination of the three
companies' assets will allow us to accomplish fundamental
changes in the way we operate our downstream businesses, leading
to improved customer service, performance and growth."
</P>
<P>
Currently, Texaco-branded products are sold by Star Enterprise,
a 50 to 50 joint venture between subsidiaries of Texaco and Saudi
Aramco.
</P>
<P>
The three companies expect the new organization to result in
greater profitability and productivity through the sharing of
management systems, business processes and other efficiencies, the
release said.
</P>
<P>
The new alliance will combine the refining strength of Star
Enterprise with the strong U.S. eastern region marketing
presence of Shell.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi Aramco will continue to supply the majority of
approximately 600,000 barrels of oil per day processed by Star's
three U.S.-based refineries.
</P>
<P>
The consolidation of Shell and Star assets will create one of
the largest refining and marketing networks in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Pending completion of regulatory reviews and definitive
agreements, all Texaco, Star Enterprise and Shell downstream
facilities will continue to operate separately.
</P>
<P>
The exploration, production and chemical businesses of the
companies are not part of the new joint venture, the release
said.

<HEADLINE> Cease-fire Monitors Warn Stepped-up Violence in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 17 (Xinhua) -- An international panel warned
today that a cease-fire agreement implemented in south Lebanon
since last year was in peril due to intensified fightings between
Israeli forces and Lebanese Hezbollah guerrilla.
</P>
<P>
The five-nation cease-fire monitoring committee blamed Lebanon
and Israel equally for the "quickening chain of action and
reaction that is likely to shake" the cease-fire understanding
reached between the two countries in April, 1996.
</P>
<P>
"Responsible authorities are called upon to exercise caution
and self-restraint in order to defuse tensions and protect
civilians living on both sides of the border," said the committee
in a communique released at the end of its meeting today.
</P>
<P>
The cease-fire monitoring committee, grouping France, Israel,
Lebanon, Syria and the United States, held Israel responsible for
the deaths of three civilians killed "deliberately or
unintentionally" in shellings on south Lebanese villages earlier
this week.
</P>
<P>
It said Lebanon was also to blame for the resurgent barrages
of Katyusha rockets fired on the border of Israel's Galilee
panhandle in the past two days although no casualties or damages
on the Israeli side were reported from the missile assaults.
</P>
<P>
A member of the Lebanese delegation to the committee who
declined to be named said that his team explained to the plenary
meeting the Katyusha barrages were fired on northern Israel in
retaliation for Israeli attacks that caused civilian casualties.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese delegation said the civilian population of the
country should be protected on equal level with Israel's northern
settlers under the 1996 April understanding, which was mediated
by former U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher to halt a
17-day Israeli blitz in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"Combatants are responsible for the methods with which they
perform their combat missions and should be aware of the
consequences of their action," the committee communique said.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Lebanese House Speaker Nabih Berri
urged the monitoring committee to "undertake more vigor in
preventing Israeli aggression."
</P>
<P>
Berri accused the Jewish state of "deliberately escalating
hostilities every summer to jolt the progress of Lebanon's
recovery" from the disasters of the 1975-90 civil war.
</P>
<P>
Yet Berri, who heads the pro-Syrian Amal militia that rivals
Hezbollah for supremacy in Lebanon's Shiite Muslim community,
ruled out a repetition of Israel's "Grapes of Wrath" operation,
saying "I don't expect a large-scale Israeli attack in the near
future."

<HEADLINE> ECOWAS, Sierra Leone to Talk Over Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The Economic Community of West
African States (ECOWAS) and the Sierra Leonean military
government led by Major Johnny Koromah are to hold talks in
Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire today.
</P>
<P>
The one-day talk is expected to find an acceptable solution to
the crisis caused by the military government's taking power by
force from elected president Ahmed Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
The ECOWAS team to the talks is led by Nigerian Foreign
Minister Tom Ikimi, with the participation of the his
counterparts from Ghana, Guinea and Cote d'Ivoire.
</P>
<P>
ECOWAS has in more than one cases made clear its standing that
coup is no more acceptable in today's world and that the
legitimate government of President Kabbah must be restored.
</P>
<P>
ECOWAS is more determined today than at any time to ensure the
peace and stability of the west African sub-region not be
disturbed, as its efforts to bring peace in Liberia is near to
the final success, with the presidential and legislative
elections to be held in that country just Saturday.
</P>
<P>
However, having consolidated its power in nearly two months,
with the swearing-in of Major Koromah himself as the head of
state and the appointment of a 17-man cabinet, the new military
government is less likely to give in.
</P>
<P>
Leaving for the Abidjan talks Wednesday at the Freetown
airport held by ECOWAS soldiers, the new Sierra Leonean Chief
Secretary of State Solomon Musa said, "We are going to put the
case for the coup across at last."
</P>
<P>
He lamented that the international community has not given the
new government the opportunity to explain itself but had
condemned it outright.
</P>
<P>
Major Koromah has repeatedly said that he had come to power to
correct the bad situation in Sierra Leone during Kabbah's rule,
by which he means that Kabbah has failed to make peace with the
rebel forces of Foday Sanko, the Revolutionary United Front.
</P>
<P>
Koromah has done this and that is a great strength of him.
</P>
<P>
Thus as he promised to go back to barracks once peace is in
the country, Koromah also warned, "Now that peace is at our
doorstep. If we allow it to slip away, we shall never get it
again because the rebels will not go back to the bush."
</P>
<P>
Koromah is not, of course, looking for a head-on collision
with ECOWAS, and indeed, the international society.
</P>
<P>
According to a foreign ministry official in Freetown, the
military government will press for the formation of a broad-based
government at the Abidjan talks.
</P>
<P>
The new thing with such a broad-based government is that it
will include toppled former president Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
Before this, Koromah has refused to let Kabbah back and
actually said that Kabbah can only return to Freetown to face
imprisonment for inviting foreign intervention.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, ASEAN Foreign Ministers Meet in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's peace is hard-won and
thus differences and contradictions should be resolved through
peaceful means, Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Qian
Qichen said here today.
</P>
<P>
Qian made the remarks this afternoon in a meeting with a
delegation of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN),
including foreign ministers Ali Alatas of Indonesia, Domingo
Siazon of the Philippines and Prachuab Chaiyasarn of Thailand, who
are here to meet Cambodian King Norodom Sihanouk.
</P>
<P>
Extending welcome to them, Qian said not long ago he met with
some ASEAN counterparts during celebration activities for the
return of Hong Kong to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
A few days later, he will again meet them in a meeting of the
ASEAN forum, Qian said, adding frequent contacts between China and
the ASEAN countries are conducive to the progress of the bilateral
friendly relations and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The three foreign ministers agreed with Qian on this, saying
they expected to meet Qian again in Kuala Lumpur later this month.
</P>
<P>
Briefing Qian on the ASEAN's viewpoints on the latest
developments in Cambodia, the ministers said the ASEAN countries
are not willing to see chaos caused by war in Cambodia again. They
hoped Cambodia's internal problems will be solved through peaceful
means at an early date.
</P>
<P>
The ministers noted that the ASEAN will continue to respect
Sihanouk and the form of the Cambodian government and stick to the
principle of not interfering into Cambodia's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
The three foreign ministers also stated that the ASEAN is
willing to strengthen consultations and contacts with various
concerned parties and make due efforts for a peaceful resolution
to the problems in Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
Qian stressed that as Cambodia's peace is hard-won, no
bleed-shedding and conflicts should occur in Cambodia, and
differences and contradictions should be solved through peaceful
means.
</P>
<P>
China respects the status and role of Cambodian King Sihanouk,
and stands for safeguarding his authority and dignity, and
upholding the current form of the Cambodian government, he said.
</P>

He said, "What has happened in Cambodia belongs to internal
affairs. We hope various parties concerned follow the guideline of
national reconciliation advocated by Sihanouk, restore tranquility
as soon as possible, and make concerted efforts for peace,
stability and development in the country."
</P>
<P>
Qian expressed his appreciation for the ASEAN's efforts for a
peaceful solution to the Cambodian issue.

<HEADLINE> High Agricultural Growth Neutralizes Economic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 17 (Xinhua)-- A phenomenal growth of 5.7
percent in India's agriculture, forestry and fishing sector has
made up for a slowdown in the country's manufacturing sector and
enabled the economy to grow 6.8 percent in the fiscal year 1996-97
(April 1996-March 1997), according to Central Statistical
Organization (CSO) sources here today.
</P>
<P>
The CSO had earlier estimated that output in the manufacturing
sector would grow 10.6 percent in 1996-97 over the previous year.
The revised estimates now indicate that the manufacturing sector
might have grown 8.1 percent in 1996-97.
</P>
<P>
The revised estimates show that the manufacturing sector slowed
down substantially in 1996-97. It had grown 13.6 percent in
1995-96.
</P>
<P>
Growth in trade, hotels, transport and communication slowed
down from 13.3 percent in 1995-96 to 8.7 percent in 1996-97.
</P>
<P>
The value of output in community, social and personal services
increased 5.3 percent in 1996-97, down from 6.2 percent in
1995-96.
</P>
<P>
The CSO releases estimates of gross domestic product every
quarter. Its estimate of an overall economic growth of 6.8 percent
in 1996-97, made in January, has been retained in the revised
estimate due to big 5.7 percent increase in agriculture.

<P>
NEW DELHI, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The Kazakh IL-76 aircraft flight
crew has been held responsible by an Indian court of inquiry for
the mid-air collision between it and a Saudia Jumbo near New
Delhi, capital of India, on November 12 last year, killing all the
349 people on board, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The black boxes of the two aircraft, which gave vital clues to
the probable cause of the collision, were decoded at the Air
Accident Investigation Branch under the Department of Transport in
the UK, and at Inter-State Aviation Committee, Moscow,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
The reports of the two institutions have clearly established
that the incoming Kazakh aircraft was not at its assigned level of
15,000 feet and came down to the flight level of approximately
14,000 feet, resulting in the mid-air collision.
</P>
<P>
Justice R.C. Lahoti, who headed the court inquiry, has said
that it was up to the government to accept the findings and the
recommendations of the court of inquiry.
</P>
<P>
A 200-page report of the court of inquiry has been submitted to

<HEADLINE> Arthur Andersen Taps Potential in China Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 17 (Xinhua) -- A representative for Arthur
Andersen, a world giant in the accounting business, said today
that the company will further expand its operations in China in
the coming years.
</P>
<P>
The economic reform and development in China has provided great
opportunities in investment and trade to the world and "there is
almost no limit to the opportunities for the accounting profession
in China," John Burrows, Arthur Andersen's area managing partner
of the Asia-Pacific region, said at a press conference here today.
</P>
<P>
Burrows said that his colleagues are all "keenly aware" of the
impact that developments in China can have on other economies in
the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
"As China's financial infrastructure grows, and as its
businesses become more sophisticated and complex, and compete in
the global marketplace, the demands for our accounting, tax and
consulting services will increase dramatically," he said.
</P>
<P>
Arthur Andersen started its business in China in 1979, and in
1983 became the first foreign accounting firm to establish a
representative office in China.
</P>
<P>
To date, Arthur Andersen has assisted some 39 Chinese firms
with their listings of stocks and issuance of bonds in Hong Kong,
New York and London, valued at a total of five billion
U.S. dollars. It has also provided accounting and consulting
services to more than 50 power plants in China.
</P>
<P>
Burrows forecast that Arthur Andersen's revenue from its China
business will reach 100 million U.S. dollars this year, up 34
percent from last year. The growth rate is compared to a predicted
12 percent increase in the overall revenue from its global
business.
</P>
<P>
Arthur Andersen plans to double it present scale of business in
China by the end of the century, Burrows said.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Russia's aging space station Mir
today lost all power on most of the craft when the crew
accidentally disconnected a vital cable, but the three astronauts
on board remained safe.
</P>
<P>
The crew, two Russians and an American, said they were thrown
into darkness for one and a half hours and nothing was functioning
on board for the 45 minutes when the Earth obscured the craft from
the sun.
</P>
<P>
The crew communicated with Mission Control from an escape
capsule, which has systems independent from the rest of the Mir.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Seeks Normalization of Ties with Kuwait </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Prime Minister
Abdul-Salam Majali has expressed hope that his country will
restore fully the strained ties with Kuwait, stressing that
Jordan was now fully open to the Gulf state.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Kuwait's Arabic daily Al-Rai Al-Aam, which
was published today, the Jordanian prime minister said that
"clouds that have prevailed above the Arab world have just passed
peacefully" and "for our part, we are fully open to Kuwait."
</P>
<P>
He said disputes between his country and Kuwait were a "family
difference" and "occasional," referring to the time when Jordan
was accused of siding with Iraq which occupied its neighbor of
Kuwait during the 1990-1991 Gulf crisis.
</P>
<P>
Majali hailed the restoration of flights between Kuwait City
and Amman and other positive developments including Kuwaiti
investments in Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait and Jordan resumed direct airlinks starting from July
9, heralding a full-scale normalization of relations between
the two Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait has been inching toward renewing its ties with Jordan
that were frozen after the government accused Amman of supporting
Iraq before and after the 1991 Gulf War to end the Iraqi invasion
of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian Foreign Minister Fayez Tarawneh held talks with
Kuwaiti acting Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Sheikh Sabah
Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah in late June to discuss the issues
related to speeding up the normalization of relations between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
Their discussions included an expected visit by the Kuwaiti
foreign minister himself to Jordan.
</P>
<P>
However, Tarawneh ruled out the possibility of ties-breaking
with Iraq for the sake of mending fences with Kuwait, pointing
out that "we are friends of the Gulf (states) and Iraq."
</P>
<P>
"In our relations with Kuwait, we reject the principle of
whether it should be completely white or black," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait has a charge d'affaires in Amman, but there is no
Jordanian mission in Kuwait now.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian prime minister did not say whether there is a
timetable for his country to re-open the embassy in Kuwait which
has so far remained closed.

<HEADLINE> Trade Pressure Mounts on India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 17 (Xinhua) -- With the United States and
Australia requesting the World Trade Organization (WTO) for
dispute settlement consultations, pressure has mounted on India to
come to terms with its major trading partners on the question of
withdrawal of quantitative restrictions on imports within the next
couple of months, Commerce Ministry sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
Following the failure of the June 30-July 1 talks between India
and its western trading partners, it was expected that some of
them might move the WTO dispute settlement mechanism. Their
decision to do so has provided another opportunity for India to
present its case for a sufficiently longer period for phasing out
import restrictions and arrive at a mutually acceptable program,
they said.
</P>
<P>
India claimed that it had shown flexibility in offering to
phase out restrictions in six years, but that was rejected by the
US and other western countries. The latter wanted India to ease
its import restrictions within the next 2-3 years.
</P>
<P>
In the three rounds of talks with its trade partners under the
aegis of the WTO Balance of Payment Committee since 1995, India
had been able to delay notifying a program of phasing out import
licensing and quota. But, according to international trade
analysts, it is no longer possible to indefinitely delay the
removal of import restrictions since the US and Australian move
has now triggered off the time-bound WTO dispute settlement
procedure.

BEIJING, July 17 (Xinhua) -- China today expressed its "sincere

those matters which have occurred in Cambodia at present belong to
the country's own internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
"Any actions of other countries should be conducive to the

<HEADLINE> Township Enterprises Making Headway in Central China Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Township enterprises in China's
most populous province of Henan are making greater contributions
to local economic growth and farmers' pockets.
</P>
<P>
The sector produced nearly 477 billion yuan in sales and 5.07
billion yuan in profit in 1996, rising ten-fold and 3.1-fold the
figure of 1990, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Township enterprises contributed 60 percent to Henan's
industrial output increases, 50 percent to GNP increases and 42.5
percent to farmers' added incomes in the same period.
</P>
<P>
The province has begun to introduce share-holding reform to its
township enterprises in an effort to upgrade them. And 11,000
township enterprises have adopted the stock system, accounting for
15.3 percent of the province's total.
</P>
<P>
Some large township enterprises were selected to operate under
the modern enterprise system, which is widely used among China's
state firms.

<HEADLINE> Nanjing Sees More Laundromats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Over 30 newly-opened laundromats
in Nanjing have freed many local families of the chore of washing
their own clothes.
</P>
<P>
Most Chinese people traditionally do their own washing, but the
fast tempo of modern-day life has introduced the laundering
service into Chinese society.
</P>
<P>
Wang Ping, assistant general manager of a chain laundromat
company, said that most of their customers are college students,
bachelors and young couples. The cost for a load of clothes is
only about seven yuan (84 US cents). Customers can operate the
machines on their own, or get the laundromat workers to do it for
them.
</P>
<P>
Young people in particular like the laundromats, which liberate
them from household tasks.
</P>
<P>
"This price is acceptable," said Zhang Naining, a junior from
Nanjing Normal University. "I come to the laundromat once or twice
a week," he said.
</P>
<P>
Some store owners said they receive an average of 30 to 40
customers every day.

<HEADLINE> Family Planning Brings Down Birth Rate in Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The national birth rate in Egypt
witnessed a noticeable decline in the last decade thanks to the
family planning program.
</P>
<P>
Lastest census figures released by the Central Agency for
Mobilization and Statistics (CAMS) show that the national birth
rate has declined to 2.1 percent in 1996 from 2.8 percent in 1986.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's total population was stabilized at 61 million last
year, 4 million less than expected, according to CAMS Chairman
Ihab Elwi.
</P>
<P>
The average family size has also shrunk to 4.6 members from 4.9.
</P>
<P>
The number of women using contraceptives has more than doubled
over the last 15 years. In 1980 only 24 percent of women of
child-bearing age used contraceptives compared to 49 percent in
1995.
</P>
<P>
The birth rate decline is despite an expanded productive age
group during the past 10 years. Those aged between 15 and 60
accounted for 59.9 percent of the population last year, higher
than the 53.8 percent in 1986, said Elwi.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's family planning program focused on ensuring the
availability of contraceptives, provision of family planning
services and centers, better reproductive health and prenatal
care, as well as enhancing public awareness.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the tendency to marry late also contributed
to the decline in the population growth rate, said Elwi.
</P>
<P>
The number of married decreased to 61.2 percent of the
population in 1996 from 64.8 percent in 1986, while the unmarried,
excluding the widows and widowers, accounted for 27.8 percent of
the population, compared to 25.7 percent a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the census revealed that the illiteracy rate among
the Egyptians has declined from 49.6 percent to 38.6 percent, with
university degree-holders representing 7.3 percent of the
population, compared to 4.3 percent ten years ago.
</P>
<P>
The workforce rose to 35.4 percent of the population last year
from 34.4 percent in 1986.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan to Continue Peace Efforts in Afghanistan: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan will continue its
diplomatic efforts to bring the Afghan warring factions to the
negotiating table, a Foreign Office spokesman said here today.
</P>
<P>
In the past two weeks, the Pakistani delegation led by
Additional Foreign Secretary Iftikhar Murshed has held extensive
talks respectively with the leadership of the Islamic Taliban
militia and anti-Taliban northern alliance, the spokesman told a
weekly news briefing here.
</P>
<P>
During the meetings, the two sides exchanged views regarding
steps that would lead the two sides to the negotiating table, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"Because of their (the warring factions) divergent positions,
progress has been slow," he noted.
</P>
<P>
"Nevertheless, we are encouraged to find the fact that all the
parties concerned appreciated Pakistan's peace initiatives and
assured their cooperation and have asked us to continue our
efforts," he said.
</P>
<P>
When asked if Pakistan has got close to an intra-Afghan
dialogue, the spokesman said: "It would be realistic to say we've
got close to but our efforts will continue."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also announced at the weekly news briefing that
Japanese Foreign Minister Yukihiko Ikeda will visit Pakistan from
July 21 to 23.
</P>
<P>
During Ikeda's visit, the focus of talks will be on the
strengthening of economic and commercial ties between Pakistan and
Japan, he said, adding that the two sides will sign three
agreements concerning Japanese development assistance to Pakistan.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Labor Secretary Leonardo
Quisumbing said here today that the unemployment rate in the
country has been declining during the past few years.
</P>
<P>
He said data of the Department of Labor and Employment showed
that the unemployment rate went down from 8.8 percent in January
1995 to 8.3 percent and 7.7 percent in 1996 and 1997 respectively.
</P>
<P>
Quisumbing added that the improvement in employment coincided
with a rapid growth of the country's labor force, which rose
markedly from 27.85 million in 1994 to the current 31.3 million.
</P>
<P>
The data showed that the increase of employment in rural areas
was the highest as about 47 percent of the country's labor force
found jobs in the countryside.
</P>
<P>
The figures also indicated that more and more Filipinos are now
engaged in better and more productive jobs, especially in the
rural areas, Quisumbing said.

<P>
CANBERRA, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar took a
break from its steady decline today, closing higher against the
U.S. currency after a day of reasonable bidding.
</P>
<P>
The local unit finished at 73.67 U.S. cents, up from 73.25
Wednesday, and near today's high of 73.78 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
Westpac Bank's manager of foreign exchange, Wayne Raven, said
the Australian dollar had run into some buying interest across the
board which had offered it support.
</P>
<P>
He said while the local currency was having difficulty reaching
the 73.80 cents level today, it may well move higher in offshore
trading tonight.
</P>
<P>
Ongoing speculation of an easing in monetary policy by the
Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) by the end of August remains the
dominant factor for the local currency.
</P>
<P>
There has been some sentiment in the market that if the
Australian dollar continues to slide, the RBA may not move to cut
rates in the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
On the cross-rates, the Australian dollar ended at 85.53
Japanese yen, up from 84.55, and at 1.3252 German marks, up from

PARIS, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The closure of the Vilvoorde auto plant by Renault auto
company overshadowed the first day of the visit by President
Jacques Chirac in Belgium on Wednesday. But the two countries
reached an agreement over the Dassault corruption scandal, as
France has agreed to transmit to Belgium the documents needed for
investigating alleged bribery offered by Dassault Aviation group
to Belgian officials.
</P>
<P>
-- According to the Belgian political scientist Joel Kotek, the
French-speaking Walloon part of Belgium is experiencing a deep
identity crisis worsened by an economic crisis, as most of the
common historic and cultural patrimony of Belgium is taken by the
northern Dutch-speaking Flemish part of the country. The only
surviving myth to keep together the Walloons is the comic strip
hero Tintin, designed by Georges Remi Herge, he said.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- Prime Minister Lionel Jospin will chair today a cabinet
session to examine how to keep the budget in balance in
anticipation of an announcement on July 21 by a public finance
audit on France's public deficit this year, which is expected to
be around 3.5 percent of gross domestic product. The way for
Jospin to reduce the deficit is most probably to impose "euro
taxes" on enterprises and wealthy families.
</P>
<P>
-- Prime Minister Jospin retorted Wednesday the attacks made by
President Jacques Chirac upon his policies on Bastille Day, saying
that he has the "constitutional prerogatives" to decide his
policies. During a television interview on Monday, Chirac
criticized the policies of Jospin on family allowances,
privatizations, and immigration.

first wave of the European Monetary Union (EMU), according to a

come for a serious debate about Economic and Monetary Union."
</P>
<P>
"Whether Britain is in or out (of the first wave), EMU will
have profound implications for British business and the British
economy."
</P>

criteria for the single currency, euro.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Defense Minister Favors Talks with Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Defense Secretary Renato
de Villa said today that he favored holding peace talks as the
final and best solution to the government's rift with Muslim
rebels.
</P>
<P>
While stressing that the military has enough capability to deal
with the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) rebels in the
southern part of the country, De Villa said using force is not the
only way to solve the problem.
</P>
<P>
"Unlike in a conventional war, you don't really totally
eliminate an enemy force," he said, adding that in an insurgency
situation, people do not use only force, but use many other means
including peace talks to solve the problem.
</P>
<P>
"To me, it (holding peace talks) is the best option. To me, it
is the final option. To me, it is an acceptable option to all of
our people because we are all Filipinos here trying to settle our
own problems", he said.
</P>
<P>
The 12,000-member MILF is a breakaway faction of the Moro
National Liberation Front which signed a final peace agreement
with the government last year.
</P>
<P>
The government and the MILF have been trying to re-open their
peace talks stalled by the military's recent offensives in which
dozens of MILF rebels were killed.
</P>
<P>
MILF leaders have warned of a long deadlock in the peace talks,
citing the government's refusal to pull troops out of areas of
conflicting in Cotabato and Maguindanao provinces.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Interest Rate Caps Likely to be Eased </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Thailand is
considering easing interest rate controls on local financial
institutions to reflect economic and market realities.
</P>
<P>
The cap on deposit rates for commercial banks and finance
companies was established on June 30 and was aimed at stemming the
transfer of public deposits after the authorities announced the
suspension of 16 ailing finance and securities companies.
</P>
<P>
The deposit interest rate cap for commercial banks was set at
12 percent and 14 percent for finance companies.
</P>
<P>
Bank of Thailand deputy governor Jaroong Nookwun said Wednesday
that the authorities were prepared to adjust the interest rate
caps to reflect market needs.
</P>
<P>
He said deposit interest rates should not be too high, as this
would increase the funding costs of local financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
Olarn chaipravat, president of the Thai Bankers' Association,
said lifitng the ceiling would almost certainly result in
commercial banks raising rates, reflecting the tight liquidity in
the money market.
</P>
<P>
Average inter-finance rates currently stand at 20-25 percent,
he said, adding that mobilizing funds from the public would thus
prove cheaper than borrowing in the money market.
</P>
<P>
With increased capital inflow as a result of a cheaper baht,
local interest rates would be able to drop, although this would
likely take up to one year, he said.

<HEADLINE> PNA: UN Resolution on Settlement an Arab Victory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian permanent delegate to
the United Nations Nasser Al Koddwah today hailed the U.N.
resolution urging an end to Israeli settlement activities in
the Palestinian lands "a victory for the Arab party."
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Egyptian Voice of Arabs radio this morning,
Koddwah called for the continuation of the U.N. General Assembly
emergency session to follow up the issue.
</P>
<P>
For the third time, the General Assembly Tuesday voted
overwhelmingly to condemn Israel's failure to stop a housing
project in Jerusalem and urged member states to discourage
activities that contribute to Jewish settlements.
</P>
<P>
The approval of the resolution by 131 states is regarded a
victory for the Arab party, he added.
</P>
<P>
"The Palestinian delegate reiterated the significance of the
U.N. resolution from the legal and political aspects as it will
help increase Israel's isolation internationally," he said.
</P>
<P>
The resolution, though shy away from ordering economic
sanctions against Israel, is considered by Arabs an important step
in keeping up international pressure against Israel's decision to
build the Har Homa settlement in East Jerusalem, where the
Palestinians want as their future capital.
</P>
<P>
The non-binding resolution, tabled by Arab and Muslim
countries, was approved by 131 countries, with the U.S., Israel
and Micronesia Islands opposing and 14 others, including Russia,
abstaining.
</P>
<P>
"Both the U.S. and Israel have launched a ferocious campaign to
hinder the issuance of this resolution. But the Arab side led by
Egypt had succeeded in rendering its issuance," said the
Palestinian official.
</P>
<P>
Although the U.S. vote of objection is "very strange" in its
capacity as a key Mideast peace sponsor, the Arab side is still
hoping that the U.S. would play a balanced role and give up its
bias to Israel.
</P>
<P>
But Israel said it would not bow to what it called "false
international pressure" and the U.S. warned the resolution would
undermine rather than build the peace process.

<P>
BEIJING, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Road workers have been braving the
burning sun to finish the Shanghai section of an east China
expressway between Shanghai, China's largest business center, and
Hangzhou, capital city of Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
Of the total 2.1 billion yuan to be invested in the project, 60

accelerated the construction of highways in China, but also brought
about enormous changes in the sector as a whole in terms of
bidding, management and supervision, according to the official.

<P>
JAKARTA, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali
Alatas said here Wednesday that the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN) does not intend to propose anything that would
settle Cambodia's internal crisis.
</P>
<P>
"We go to Beijing without bringing any recipe. We merely want

conflict," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Alatas, along with foreign ministers of Thailand and the
Philippines, Prachuab Chaiyasarn and Domingo Siazon, is expected

Prince Norodom Ranariddh after talking with the king.
</P>
<P>
"I hope I could be in Phnom Penh as soon as possible to meet
with Cambodian Second Prime Minister Hun Sen after that," he added.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Diplomat: Iraq Wants Closer Ties With Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 17 (Xinhua) -- A senior Iraqi diplomat has said
that Iraq attaches great importance to its relations with Turkey
and wants closer Iraqi-Turkish cooperation, local newspaper Daily
News reported today.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with the paper on the occasion of
Iraq's 29th anniversary of national day on July 14, Iraqi Charge
d'affaires Saad Al-Samarrai said that Iraq regards Ankara as one
of its most important partners.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the brotherly relations between the two
countries are based on the friendly affection between the peoples,
adding the bilateral ties should not be subject to the change of
leaders.
</P>
<P>
"Relations between Turkey and Iraq should be at the highest
possible level in view of our historical and cultural
relations. We expect a greater effort on the part of Turkey both
in the economic and political fields, " Al-Samarrai said.
</P>
<P>
The diplomat, however, also expressed his disappointment with
the current situation of the relations of the two neighboring
nations.
</P>
<P>
Complaining that Turkey failed to give more support to the
U.N. sanctions-hit country, Al-Samarrai stressed that this caused
great loss to both countries.
</P>
<P>
Since the implementation of the oil-for-food agreement reached
between U.N. and Iraqi government, Turkey won only a small part of
the food contracts with Iraq due to its high prices.
</P>
<P>
On the Kurdish issue, Al-Samarrai denied the press reports
that the Baghdad administration was trying to play a Kurdish card
against Turkey.
</P>
<P>
"Turkey is strategically important for Baghdad. If Turkey is
hurt, Iraq will also be hurt. We will never play any PKK (Kurdish
Workers' Party) card against Ankara," he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Baghdad is against any forms of international
terrorism including "the actions of PKK."
</P>
<P>
Turkey ordered a large-scale cross-border military campaign on
May 14 in northern Iraq to wipe out the outlawed PKK rebels
there, drawing strong opposition from the Iraqi government and
other Arab and Western countries as well.
</P>
<P>
The official said that there are great potentials for the
Iraqi-Turkish economic cooperation, but the ball is in Ankara's
court.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Builds 25 Street Kids Centers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-five street children
centers in 11 towns have been established so as to control the
growing problem of street children in Tanzania, local press
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question concerned at the National Assembly in
Dodoma, central Tanzania Wednesday, the Deputy Minister for
Labour and Youth Development, William Lukuvi, said the projects
were in Arusha, Dar es Salaam, Dodoma, Mwanza and some other
towns.
</P>
<P>
The deputy minister acknowledged the prevalence of the problem
but said that it was on an increase because of social problems
facing the country.
</P>
<P>
He said the problem emerged for the first time in 1986 when a
lot of children were spotted loitering in streets in big towns
like Dar es Salaam, Arusha and Mwanza.
</P>
<P>
To understand the dimensions of the problem, Lukuvi said his
ministry did a research in Dar es Salaam way back in 1990. The
research revealed that the city had about 350 street children, he
added.
</P>
<P>
The deputy minister said the research also showed that among
the reasons forcing children into street life were economic
hardships in their families and the break up of their parents'
marriages.
</P>
<P>
Lukuvi said the establishment of the street children centers,
run by religious organizations and individuals, was one of the
strategies intended to curb or reduce the problem of street
children.
</P>
<P>
He also said the ministry would co-ordinate all street
children projects and provide counselling and guidance to enable
families bring up children well and provide them with basic
necessities.
</P>
<P>
The deputy minister said that the government would strengthen
children day-care centers, fight for children rights and
intensify efforts to take care of orphans.

<HEADLINE> Israel Clamps Closure on Palestinian Cities in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Israeli troops have closed off
all Palestinian-controlled cities in the West Bank to Israelis
for security reasons, Israel Radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
The closure affected the cities of Bethlehem, Hebron,
Ramallah, Jericho, Kalkilya, Tulkarm and Nablus. Israeli troops
took the action following Monday's arrest of three Palestinian
policemen, who allegedly attempted to carry out a shooting
attack against the Har Bracha settlement near Nablus.
</P>
<P>
Israeli security establishment decided to bar Israelis from
entering the Palestinian cities because of fears about possible
revenge taken by Palestinians on Israelis, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
Israeli senior political and military officials took advantage
of the incident by lauching verbal attacks on the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) to pressure it to crack down on
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy accused Wednesday the PNA
police of fomenting and inciting anti-Israeli violence instead
of quelling it. Levy said Israeli seucirty forces could react
severely to Heborn's Palestinian rioters, but they preferred to
exercise restraint as long as the city's Jewish residents were
not endangered.
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai raised the issue of the
Palestinian policemen during his overnight meeting with PNA
Planning Minister Nabil Shaath at the residence of Egyptian
Ambassador Mohammed Bassiouny near Tel Aviv. Mordechai demanded
the PNA take urgent steps to prevent the repetition of such
incident.
</P>
<P>
Army Chief of Staff Amnon Shahak, who toured Hebron late
Wednesday, also strongly blasted the PNA for ordering attacks on
Israelis, like the one stymied at Har Bracha Monday. He demanded
the PNA arrest Palestinian police's Assistant Commander Jihad
Masini, who was blamed by Israel for being behind the attack
plot.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that a clarification of the matter (will lead to)
steps they must take to understand how this sort of thing was
possible," Shahak said.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side has not yet responded to the Israeli
claims and demands concerning the arrest of three Palestinian
policemen. But in recent days, Palestinian police played a more
active role in preventing Palestinian rioters from attacking
Israeli soldiers in Hebron, helping calm down the tense situation
in the wake of recent waves of violence.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 2,000 Palestinian mouners attended Wednesday the
funeral in Beit Sahur, south of Jerusalem, of a 16-year-old
Palestinian who was shot in the head with a rubber bullet by
Israeli soldiers Monday and died of the wounds later.
</P>
<P>
The funeral later turned violent as Palestinian mourners
stoned an Israeli police patrol, injuring one of the border
policeman. Israeli soldiers responded with rubber bullets and
tear gas to disperse the rioters and arrested two of them.

Two local residents from this port city in northeast China's
Liaoning Province spotted him on July 10 sitting on a tree near
the beach in the southern part of the city.
</P>
<P>
The missing panda was immediately reported to police. Four
policemen and the two residents kept watch under the tree until
panda-catchers from the zoo arrived. They spread a net under the
tree for the panda to jump into.
</P>
<P>
Though a good deal slimmer than before, the panda seems to have
a good appetite. Lesser pandas live on bamboo shoots, fruit and
small animals.
</P>
<P>
Zookeepers said that the panda was able to survive such a long
time on his own thanks to a bamboo forest in the southeast of the
zoo and a lake nearby.
</P>
<P>
"It was not difficult for the panda to find food and
water. That's lucky for him," they said.
</P>
<P>
The Lesser Panda, with yellow, white and black stripes, is now
under second-class government protection. It lives in the forests
in southwest China.

<HEADLINE> Israeli, Palestinian Officials Meet to Solve </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai met with Palestinian National Authority (PNA)
Planning Minister Nabil Shaath Wednesday night in a bid to pave
the way for reviving the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The two officials held the meeting at the residence of
Egyptian ambassador in Tel Aviv, Mohammed Bassiouny, in Herzliya
Pituah, near Tel Aviv, in the presence of the United States
Ambassador Martin Indyk.
</P>
<P>
This was the second meeting held by Mordechai and Shaath at the
same place in less than two weeks.
</P>
<P>
No details of the meeting were disclosed, but Israel Radio
reported that the two sides discussed the unsolved issues on
opening the Gaza airport and seaport, building "safe passages"
between the West Bank and Gaza Strip and the release of more
Palestinian detainees by Israel.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to Palestinian reporters before the meeting, Shaath
said he did not expect much from the meeting. He called it the
"last chance" to prevent a disaster, which would occur if there
was no further progress in the talks.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Mordechai expressed concern about the recent
disclosure that three Palestinian policemen were caught red-handed
during an attempt to attack a Jewish settlement.
</P>
<P>
He told Shaath that the PNA should take urgent steps to
prevent the recurrence of such incidents.
</P>
<P>
Israel announced Tuesday that its security forces arrested
three Palestinian policemen on Monday night in their attempt to
carry out a shooting attack on the settlement of Har Bracha on
Mount Grizim, overlooking Nablus.
</P>
<P>
During their first meeting a week ago, Mordechai and
Shaath made some progress on the issues of opening the Gaza
airport and seaport.
</P>
<P>
Later officials from both sides reached agreement on naming
the Dahaniya airport as the Gaza International Airport and on the
taking-off and landing procedures of the airport.
</P>
<P>
But the two sides still failed to solve the thorny issues of
security arrangements, as Israel insists on controlling the
security checks in order to prevent the PNA from using the
airport and seaport for getting weapons that could threaten
Israel's security.
</P>
<P>
If the two sides resolved the remaining differences, it could
pave the way for resuming the Israeli-Palestinian peace
negotiations that have been frozen since March when Israel began
building the Har Homa settlement in East Jerusalem.

<HEADLINE> Dar Port to Go Commercial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The container and grain
terminals at the Dar es Salaam port will be commercialized in the
first phase of a three-year plan to restructure the Tanzania
Harbors Authority (THA).
</P>
<P>
The THA Acting Director General, Peter Mtandu, said here
Wednesday that the business units would operate autonomously
under the restructuring aimed at making the authority a landlord
port.
</P>
<P>
He said under a commercialization study completed last August,
which has been endorsed by the government, the THA would continue
owning the port infrastructure but would no longer have a role in
direct operations.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the container and grain terminals, the plan is to
make the general cargo, bulk liquid, coastal terminals, and the
Tanga and Mtwara ports go into joint venture or lease.
</P>
<P>
Mtandu was presenting a paper at a three-day workshop on port
commercialization jointly organized by the Economic Commission
for Africa, Economic Commission for Latin America and Port
Management Association of Eastern and Southern Africa, being held
in the city.
</P>
<P>
"THA will progress into privatization in stages by having a
transitional period in order to avoid crisis as well as avail
itself time of upgrading its different business units to a level
where private operators will be compelled to give a fair
compensation for managing and operating the facilities," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Mtandu, there was a compelling need to involve
the private sector in port operations in developing countries
like Tanzania to perform efficiently and effectively.
</P>
<P>
"The plan drawn for THA envisages that by the year 2000
operational activities will have been separated from the
regulatory and ownership framework and the private sector playing
a leading role," the acting general manager said.
</P>
<P>
Mtandu said although THA's performance has improved
considerably, particularly with regard to containerized traffic,
the need for restructuring the corporation was imperative because
of the competitive environment in port operations.
</P>
<P>
The workshop, which is being hosted by THA, was opened by the
Principal Secretary in the Ministry of Communications and
Transport, Salim Msoma.

JOHANNESBURG, July 17 (Xinhua) -- De Beers Consolidated Mines
(DBCM), the South African diamond giant, has reached an agreement
with the Guinean government over mining in the western African
country, said informed sources reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, De Beers Centenary, the offshore diamond
arms of DBCM, will be allowed to manage any mine it explores in
Guinea.
</P>
<P>
The accord also provides for diamonds produced at any new
mines to be sold through the Central Selling Organization (CSO),
De Beers' diamond purchasing and marketing arms, the sources
said.
</P>
<P>
De Beers has been prospecting for kimberlites -- hard rock
deposits generally considered likely to contain diamonds -- in
Guinea since 1995.
</P>
<P>
The CSO reportedly operates two buying offices in Conakry and
Kankan. The buying offices purchase rough diamonds produced at

<HEADLINE> East China Province Doing Well in State Enterprise Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, July 17 (Xinhua) -- East China's Shandong Province is
making progress in its enterprise restructuring and now ranks
second in the country in terms of profit.
</P>
<P>
State-owned enterprises earned 6.1 billion yuan in profits last
year, an increase of 21.84 percent over the previous
year. Shandong also reduced the number of enterprises operating at
a loss to 25.41 percent, with total losses worth 2.9 billion yuan,
and the ratio of liability to asset to 66.05 percent.
</P>
<P>
This is encouraging compared to the situation of the country's
stagnant state enterprises, experts said.
</P>
<P>
Shandong selected some 600 major enterprises among its 3,900
state enterprise sector to form enterprise groups, which have
gathered more than 300 billion yuan worth of assets. Fifty-one of
them have begun to try out a modern enterprise system.
</P>
<P>
The province granted special support in technological
improvement projects and loans to eight giant enterprises,
including the Qingdao Haier Group and the Qingdao Brewery Group.
</P>
<P>
It also granted small state businesses greater authority in
operation and management, and introduced the share-holding system
and acquisition. As a result, 75 percent of its 44,000
county-level firms have been reorganized under different systems
and are performing well.
</P>
<P>
The Shouguang Paper-Making Group, which used to lose money, has
developed into a powerhouse in the same sector of the country,
generating more than 100 million yuan in profit and tax annually.
</P>
<P>
The coastal province spent more than 24 billion yuan on 6,000
technological upgrading projects last year, which upon completion
are expected to increase 40 billion yuan in annual industrial
output value and seven billion yuan in profit and tax a year.

<HEADLINE> Township Enterprises Thriving in Liaoning Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Township enterprises have now
become a driving force behind economic growth in northeast China's
Liaoning Province, a traditional base of State industries.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the introduction of the market economic system, an
increasing number of state enterprises in the province flounder
against the fierce competition. In contrast, township businesses
are thriving due to their flexible managerial system.
</P>
<P>
Last year, local township undertakings generated more than 420
billion yuan in output value and earned 25 billion yuan in net
profits, and paid nearly five billion yuan in taxes to the
government. The businesses also provided five million jobs for the
local surplus laborers.
</P>
<P>
Most township enterprises are concentrated in the provincial
capital of Shenyang and the coastal city of Dalian. The are mostly
involved in the fields of machinery, light industry, building
materials, and chemicals, and account for more than three-fourths
of the local total large businesses in the sectors.
</P>
<P>
The province now has 80 township enterprise groups and more
than 300 medium- and large-sized township enterprises. The number
of such enterprises is expected to climb to 800 by the turn of the
century.

HONG KONG, July 17 (Xinhua) -- China Resources, a leading
China-affiliated conglomerate in Hong Kong, will be added to the
Hang Seng Index, the key indictor of 33 blue chips listed on the
Hong Kong Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
With hefty market capitalization and brisk trading, China

<HEADLINE> HK Legislators Pass Bill Freezing Some Pre-handover laws </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The legislators of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (SAR) passed a SAR
government-proposed bill to freeze a number of pre-handover laws
overnight after a seven-hour fierce debate.
</P>
<P>
The 60-seat Provisional Legislative Council (PLC) of the HKSAR
also passed the United Nations Sanctions Bill, which was tabled to
the legislature also by the SAR government.
</P>
<P>
Under the government's original umbrella bill called the
Legislative Provisions (Suspension of Operation) Bill 1997, all
seven ordinances passed by the disbanded previous Legislative
Council at its last session, days before Hong Kong's July 1
handover, were proposed to be frozen.
</P>
<P>
The bill was carried by a vote of 40 to nine overnight at a
full session of the PLC. The laws it suspends mainly concern labor
rights.
</P>
<P>
However, the legislators agreed only to freeze four of the
seven laws. Three other laws the legislators refused to suspend
cover the compensation payments for deafness, the May 1 public
holidays and the protection of the harbor from reclamation.
</P>
<P>
Speaking before the legislators' debate, Chief Secretary for
Administration of the SAR government, Anson Chan Fang On-sang,
stressed that it was necessary to suspend all the seven laws.
</P>
<P>
She said the SAR government was sincere in its desire to study
the laws, more carefully before deciding whether they should be
enacted.
</P>
<P>
"We have given careful consideration to this matter and, as
responsible government, believe it is wrong to repeal these laws,
so we choose to suspend them for further examination instead,"
said the chief secretary.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the SAR government-proposed bill, Chief Executive
of the SAR government Tung Chee Hwa stressed on Wednesday that it
was correct to freeze the labor rights-related laws passed by the
previous Legislative Council.
</P>
<P>
Any reckless passage of these laws, without full consultation
and detailed study, may harm harmonious labor-management relations
in Hong Kong, Tung pointed out.

<HEADLINE> Man Catches Rare Disease after Eating Raw Seafood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 17 (Xinhua) -- A 30-year-old man in Shanghai,
who had eaten some raw seafood before this year's Spring Festival,
is suffering from a rare parasitic disease.
</P>
<P>
The man, surnamed Wu, discovered a red lump on his chest
several days after he ate the seafood. The lump grew and other
lumps formed on his hands, arms and neck, which were swollen,
itchy, and painful.
</P>
<P>
Doctors found it difficult to control the spreading disease,
which was caused by gnathostoma, a type of parasite in sea animals.
</P>
<P>
Experts at the Shanghai Parasite Institute said that the larva
of gnathostoma usually grow in the bodies of fish, frogs and
snakes, while the adults live in the stomachs, esophagus and
kidneys of human beings.
</P>
<P>
After entering a human body, the worm will move through the
body, causing lumps and inflammation of the skin. This can result
in massive bleeding and tissue damage, and when it enters the
internal organs, even death, the experts said. Only about a dozen
cases of the disease have been reported in China in the past 80
years.
</P>
<P>
They suggested people eat cooked seafood instead of raw to
prevent parasite diseases.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Endorses Efforts to Protect Kids From Internet Smut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 16 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today backed private-sector efforts to protect children from
Internet smut, after his bid for legal limits on Internet was
rejected by the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
Clinton and Vice President Al Gore met earlier today with
parents groups, lawmakers and industry officials to discuss a new
approach of voluntary cooperation from the television industry in
rating programs to protect children.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the Supreme Court struck down a law banning
indecent material on the Internet as a violation of the First
Amendment. Clinton said he was acting in response to the Supreme
Court decision.
</P>
<P>
Following his meeting with industry leaders, Clinton praised
the Microsoft and Netscape companies, which he said are developing
browsers that would let parents block objectionable sites.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he and industry leaders "have reached a consensus
about how to pave the way to a family-friendly Internet without
paving over the constitutional guarantees of free speech and free
expression."
</P>
<P>
The consensus backed a three-pronged policy, with roles for
industry, government, and parents and educators, Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
In the last three months, the Federal Bureau of Investigation
(FBI) has investigated computer-related exploitation of minors and
established a task force specializing in stopping computer child
pornography.
</P>
<P>
"We simply must not allow pornographers and pedophiles to
exploit this wonderful new medium to abuse our children," Clinton
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian government today
welcomed U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan's announcement of a
major reform package aimed at establishing a more "coherent,
strategic and agile U.N."
</P>
<P>
"These new measures, along with those announced by the
Secretary-General in January and March, are intended to reshape
the U.N. and make it more relevant and effective," Canadian Foreign
Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"This second package constitutes an ambitious and imaginative
effort to streamline U.N. structures and to ensure that the
U.N. has the means to forecast and address urgent humanitarian and
development needs in the world," he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said reforming an institution as complex and vital
as the U.N. is a "delicate and difficult task" and that the
Secretary-General's efforts "deserve the support of all member
states."
</P>
<P>
"I urge the Secretary-General to move forward with rapid
implementation of the measures under his responsibility and I
intend to encourage member states to give positive consideration
to those recommendations that require their approval," he added.
</P>
<P>
The minister also revealed that his country is campaigning for
a non-permanent seat on the Security Council for the term
1999-2000.
</P>
<P>
One of Canada's objectives on the Council will be to advance
the reform agenda in the areas of peace and security, he said.

ULAN BATOR, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Mongolia is satisfied with its

Developing Mongolian-Japanese relations is of primary

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Southeast Asian Currencies Remain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Southeast Asian currencies remained
unsettled although pressures on the embattled currencies eased
somewhat Wednesday, traders and economists said.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines' peso strengthened slightly against the U.S.
dollar Wednesday, closing at 29.352 and at a weighted average of
29.322 for the day's trading compared with an average of 29.674
the previous day.
</P>
<P>
In Malaysia, the ringgit was confined to a narrow range as
operators took profit after the dollar's failure to break the
2.570 level, as the central bank was believed to have intervened.
</P>
<P>
The Thai baht held above the 30 level against the dollar
despite offshore attempts to push it down.
</P>
<P>
In Indonesia, the rupiah was depressed by ample money market
liquidity and was at 2,457.00 to the dollar against an opening of
2,453.00.
</P>
<P>
As the market stabilizes in the Philippines, the central bank
today lowered its key overnight borrowing rates from 32 percent to
28 percent.
</P>
<P>
The bank doubled the short-term rates to boost the peso when
Thailand instituted a de facto devaluation of the baht two weeks
ago.
</P>
<P>
Although volatility in the region's markets appeared to be
slowing down, traders and economists predicted that Southeast
Asian currencies will remain unsettled until markets fully digest
the policy shifts spawned by Thailand's decision to float the baht
on July 2. The baht has fallen 18 percent in value since then.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government's decision had a grave impact on the
region's currency markets. It forced the Philippine central bank
to trade the peso at "a wider range" last Friday and the peso has
lost 12.5 percent against the dollar in three trading days under
pressure from speculators.
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to make the rupiah less of a target for currency
speculators, Indonesia widened the rupiah's daily trading band to
12 percent from 8 percent last Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian government has also allowed the ringgit to fall.
</P>
<P>
But many of Thailand's woes will continue to buffet neighbors'
currencies, at least in the near future, as the country's
financial trouble is continuing and has an adverse effect on its
economic relations with its neighbors, economists said.
</P>
<P>
Slower economic growth catapulted Thailand into its current
financial trouble. A combination of freewheeling commercial
lending and untrammeled investment by Thai property companies set
the stage. The oversupply of residential and office buildings has
led to defaults on many property loans, which crippled some banks.
</P>
<P>
"My chief worry is that the continued problems in Thailand --
along with posing problems for Thailand, of course -- also make it
difficult to say when things will settle down elsewhere," said
Donald Hanna, regional economist at Goldman Sachs in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Finance Secretary Roberto de Ocampo said Wednesday
that speculative attacks on the peso can be expected to calm down
over a period of 10 days to two weeks if the past experiences of
markets affected by the Mexico crisis are comparable.
</P>
<P>
But after the de facto devaluation of the Thai baht and the
Philippine peso, currency speculators have turned their attention
to the Malaysian and Indonesian currencies. Any ups and downs in
one currency market will affect others in the region.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, analysts said, it is unlikely for the beleaguered
Southeast Asian currency markets to become quiet in the coming
weeks.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The Thai Hotels Association (THA)
has got tough and will revoke the memberships of hotels that do
not comply with its newly announced safety rules.
</P>
<P>
New fire safety rules were issued following the Royal Jomtien
Resort blaze in Pattaya last Friday that killed at least 90
people, including foreign tourists.
</P>
<P>
The association, the country's largest grouping of hoteliers
with 350 members nationwide, said it has required its members to
submit hotel building layouts, including the location of safety
equipment, and ensure that sprinklers and emergency flights work
and exits are well lit.
</P>
<P>
The association has also reminded its members to conduct
training and fire drills twice yearly in accordance with the law.
</P>
<P>
The Royal Jomtien Resort fire substantially hurt Thailand's
tourism image both locally and internationally.
</P>
<P>
The association hopes to see an influx of foreign tourists in
the second half of the year as a result of the baht devaluation,
but the hotel industry currently also faces a number of problems
with the continuing economic crisis, as well as the immediate
image problem of hotel operators regarding fire safety, according
to THA President Prapansak Pattayanont.

<HEADLINE> EU Ban on Indian Seafood to Benefit Thai Exporters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Thailand stands to gain from a
recent decision by the European Union to ban most imports of fresh
shrimp and crab from India.
</P>
<P>
Following the ban, the EU would need to order frozen shrimp
from other sources and Thailand would step in to fill the void,
according to Thai Foreign Trade Department Director General Pracha
Jarutrakulchai.
</P>
<P>
The EU, which imports about 20,000 tons of shrimp annually from
Thailand, is the third largest market for Thai shrimp products
after the United States and Japan.
</P>
<P>
An EU committee banned Indian seafood after finding evidence of
two types of diseases in both fresh and frozen shrimp and crab.
</P>
<P>
If EU members wanted to continue importing Indian products,
they would be forced to pay more for extra inspections.

<TEXT>
<P>
The three C-130H transport planes are currently standing by in
Thailand for possible evacuation of Japanese nationals from
Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Hashimoto summoned to his official residence Foreign
Minister Yukihiko Ikeda, acting Defense Agency Director General
Hisao Horinouchi and Chief Cabinet Secretary Seiroku Kajiyama to
analyze the Cambodian situation.
</P>
<P>
The four men agreed to recall the planes basing their decision
on results of talks between Cambodian King Norodom Sihanouk and
Japanese emissary Yukio Imagawa, as well as those between
Cambodia's Second Prime Minister Hun Sen and Japanese Ambassador
Shohei Naito.
</P>
<P>
"We will collect and analyze information, keeping the
withdrawal of the planes in mind," a top government spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government hurriedly sent the transport planes to
the U-Taphao naval base in Thailand, about 175 kilometers
southeast of Bangkok, to prepare for the possible evacuation of
Japanese nationals from Cambodia in the wake of fighting between
forces of the country's two prime ministers in early July.
</P>
<P>
However, Cambodia on Monday refused to allow the Japanese
planes into it on the grounds that the situation has largely
returned to normal.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Rules out Sabotage As Cause of Air Disaster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The Cuban authorities today ruled
out sabotage as the cause of Friday's air disaster which killed
44 people.
</P>
<P>
The most probable cause of the crash of a Cubana de Aviation
airplane was a mechanical failure which paralyzed the left engine,
a statement issued by the Cuban Civil Aeronautical Institute said.
</P>
<P>
The statement added that no evidence has been found to show
that there was a fire or explosion during the flight which could
have caused the Soviet-made Antonov plane to plummet since it was
in good mechanical shape.
</P>
<P>
The aircraft dived into the sea two minutes after taking off
from the southeastern city of Santiago de Cuba en route to
Havana. Forty-four people, including six Spanish and two Brazilian
tourists, died in the disaster.
</P>
<P>
The institute said that slow speed, low altitude and the
darkness of the night prevented the crew from being able to
maneuver the airplane to avoid the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
The institute pointed out that 22 bodies have been recovered
from the waters and that 21 of them have been identified and will
be handed over to their next-of-kin.
</P>
<P>
The institute also denied a previous statement that the black
box had been located.
</P>
<P>
What was found was a voice recorder that did not contribute any
useful information to the investigation of the air disaster, the
institute said.

<HEADLINE> Ukrainian Government Promises to Repay Wages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The Ukrainian government has vowed to
pay off all back wages by November 1 if it can secure sufficient
foreign loans and financial assistance.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Igor Mituikov told parliamewnt in a recent
report on wage arrears:"I am sure that if the cabinet receives all
the foreign loans it has expected, all back wages will be paid off.
</P>
<P>
"Current budget revenues are sufficient to pay current wages,
but not enough to pay off back wages."
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Valery Pustovoitenko, who has been nominated by
President Leonid Kuchma as the new prime minister, said he would
take charge of matters concerning the payment of back wages and
pensions if appointed.
</P>
<P>
Before a vote on his candidacy in the parliament, he said
ensuring timely pay and pensions would constitute a major task of
the government.
</P>
<P>
Indicating that the cabinet was seeking credit from sources
other than the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Mituikov said
negotiations were underway with a number of foreign lenders.
</P>
<P>
"Now that the 1997 budget has been approved, we can borrow
money at lower interest rates, and be independent of international
financial institutions," he said.
</P>
<P>
By most accounts, Ukraine and the IMF have not reached an
agreement on a 2.5 billion U.S. dollar loan yet. The back wages
crisis is at the center of the macroeconomic mess that the IMF
insists Ukraine must clean up.
</P>
<P>
State enterprises owed employees 3.5 billion hryvnas (1.9
billion dollars) in back wages as of July 1, while state-financed
organizations owed 1.75 billion hryvnas (950 million dollars), and
the state owed pensioners 1.47 billion hryvnas (800 million
dollars), according to Mituikov.

<HEADLINE> Dongguan Becomes Major Farm Produce Exporter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Dongguan, one of the four
dynamic economic areas in south China's Guangdong Province, has
turned into a leading farm produce exporter in Guangdong.
</P>
<P>
On the strength of its next-door location to Hong Kong and
Macao, Dongguan has promoted poultry, aquatic products, fruit and
flower exports to other countries. Its exports from agriculture
last year surpassed 100 million US dollars last year, doubling the
1990 figure.
</P>
<P>
As Dongguan is an industrialized area with limited amount of
arable land, the local government has devoted great efforts to
develop high-efficiency, high-quality and high-yield agriculture,
build grain, vegetable and fruit transit stations and explore
the overseas market.
</P>
<P>
It has set up 140 foreign-funded agricultural firms which
export their own products while purchasing goods from
individually-run firms or private companies, then export them
through their worldwide marekting channels.
</P>
<P>
State-run foreign trade departments have played a leading role
in foreign trade. The Dongguan Foodstuff Import and Export Company
alone exports 20 million US dollars-worth of farm and sideline
products each year.

<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Cuban and U.S. government
representatives began the 7th round of closed-door talks on
migration today in New York, a Cuban diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
The talks were attended by the Cuban delegation headed by
Ricardo Alarcon, President of the National Assembly of the
People's Power, and the U.S. delegation led by John Hamilton,
Under Secretary of State for Central America and the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
Participants will renew the agreements on migration existed
between the two sides and reaffirm their pledge to move towards a
definitive agreement, the diplomatic source said.
</P>
<P>
The travel restrictions imposed upon Cubans by the United
States and the extradition of those allegedly responsible for the
hijacking of two Cuban aircrafts will also be discussed, said the
source.
</P>
<P>
The last meeting between the two sides was held on December
4-5, 1996 in Havana.
</P>
<P>
On September 9, 1994, Cuba and the United States signed a joint
statement on migration, complemented by an agreement signed on May
2, 1995, through which the U.S. government would grant 20,000
visas a year to Cuba and expatriate all illegal Cuban emigrants in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
Since then, more than 680 illegal Cuban emigrants have been
turned over to the Cuban authorities.
</P>
<P>
Cuba signed its first agreement on migration with the United
States in 1984 and the second in November 1987.

<HEADLINE> Russia Remains Opposed to NATO Expansion, FM Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny
Primakov said today Russia remains opposed to NATO's eastward
expansion and this position will not change.
</P>
<P>
"Russia will not change its stand on opposing NATO's eastward
expansion," Primakov told visiting journalists from leading
Japanese newspapers.
</P>
<P>
At a summit in Madrid earlier this month, NATO invited Poland,
Hungary and the Czech Republic to join the military alliance. The
three countries hope to become NATO's new members in 1999.
</P>
<P>
He refuted the notion that there exist direct links between
Russia's active diplomacy in the East and NATO's enlargement.
</P>
<P>
Russia's diplomacy should be multilateral because a multi-polar
world is being shaped, Primakov said.
</P>
<P>
On Russian-Chinese relations, the Itar-Tass agency quoted
Primakov as saying that Russia does not think that China is
threatening world peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
The resolution of the Russian-Chinese border issue, especially
the completion of frontier demarcation by the end of the year,
will provide a good example for other countries to follow, he said.
</P>
<P>
On the situation of the Korean peninsula, Primakov said that
Russia and Japan have agreed to do their best to support the
dialogue "2+2" (South Korea, the Democratic People's Republic of
Korea, China and the United States) to resolve the problem of the
Korean peninsula, and not to obstruct the dialogue.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that Russia and Japan will participate in the
talks under certain circumstances. "Russia hopes to keep a sound
relationship with the DPRK," he said.

<P>
SHANGHAI, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai has published a
series of world maps made of silk, which have been listed in the
Guinness Book of World Records.
</P>
<P>
The manufacturer, the Shanghai No. 7 Silk Printing Co. Ltd.,
said that following in the footsteps of the world maps are silk
Chinese maps. Both are printed on 1.04 meter long and 0.73 meter
wide pieces of silk.
</P>
<P>
Printing experts believe that the unique material, accurate
printing and bright colors contribute to the beauty and collection
value of the silk maps.
</P>
<P>
The manufacturer said they printed 5,000 copies of the 1997
editions of the World Map and the Chinese Map, which are now on
sale.
</P>
<P>
They also produced 200 copies each of the 1990 edition of the
World Map and the 1996 Chinese Map to be sold at auction. On the
1990 World Map, the Soviet Union still exists, and on the Chinese
map, the southwest China city of Chongqing has not been upgraded to
a municipality. The printing models have been destroyed.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Revolutionary History Museum will include copies of
the silk maps in its collection.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Ethnic Group Pursues New Life After Shelving Shotguns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Once a hunter, 44-year-old Meng
Shuying, has hung up her shotgun and now works on her farm, which
brought in more than 30,000 yuan (3,700 US dollars) in earnings
last year.
</P>
<P>
One year ago, Meng and the other 7,000 members of China's
least-populated ethnic group, the Oroqens, switched careers in a
government-sponsored move to protect local wildlife.
</P>
<P>
The Oroqens, who have lived in north China's Heilongjiang
Province and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region for generations,
are known as the "people of the mountains" who make their living
from hunting in the forests.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the government banned the killing of wildlife because
of the worsening of the eco-system. Soon, most of the Oroqen
people were channeled into the agricultural sector.
</P>
<P>
According to an official from the Oroqen Autonomous Banner, the
administrative unit at the county level in the Inner Mongolia
Autonomous Region, the Banner in 1996 allocated 300,000 yuan (some
37,500 US dollars) to help the Oroqens better adapt to their new
environment.
</P>
<P>
Banner officials also provided training in agricultural
techniques, information services, new highways and electricity to
the places where the Oroqens live.
</P>
<P>
"Our income is much higher than before," said Meng Shuying, who
is the mother of five.
</P>
<P>
She said that this year she will till more land; She bought a
tractor with a 10,000-yuan government loan last year, reclaimed
some 20 hectares of arable land, and harvested 5,000 kilograms of
soybeans.
</P>
<P>
She said, "You know, the government has substantially raised
grain purchasing prices. So, I am going to reclaim another 25 ha
of farmland this year to increase my family's grain production."
</P>
<P>
According to Meng Songlin, magistrate of the Oroqen Autonomous
Banner, the per capita income of these former hunters last year
increased by more than 50 percent to 1,150 yuan.
</P>
<P>
He said that to help Oroqen people achieve prosperity, the
government has so far spent 40 million yunan building power plants
and roads, and installing telephone sets in three Oroqen villages.
</P>
<P>
Now Oroqen people have 19 trucks, 12 tractors and 23 farm
implements, he said.
</P>
<P>
The change has had other positive outcomes: The Oroqens are now
pursuing better education and medical care. And various electric
appliances, furniture, cosmetics, and fashionable dresses have
become popular among the young people.
</P>
<P>
Since the hunting ban became effective, wild animals have
increased their populations, he said, adding that roe deer, deer
and other animals can been found often along roads in the forest
areas.

<HEADLINE> China Holds Seminar to Boost Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 17 (Xinhua) -- A four-day training program on
export credit and insurance opened yesterday in Chengdu in
southwest China's Sichuan Province, today's "China Daily" reports.
</P>
<P>
Sponsored by the State Office for Import &AMP; Export of Machinery
and Electronics Products and the Export-Import Bank of China
(Eximbank), the program is to help domestic export companies
know more about export credit and insurance.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of over 150 trade and manufacturing companies
across the country attended the program.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Gu Mingchao, vice-president of the Eximbank as
saying that machinery and electronics exports have become China's
largest export sector since 1995.
</P>
<P>
last year, exports of machinery and electronics grew 9.9 percent
to 48 billion US dollars. But high-tech products and equipment
accounted for only about ten percent of the total machinery and
electronics exports, compared with 40 percent in developed
nations, the paper said.

<HEADLINE> Azerbaijan's Economy Takes Favorable Turn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Azerbaijan's economy has taken a
favourable turn in the first half of this year with a 5.2 percent
increase in the gross domestic product (GDP) compared to the same
period last year, says the Interfax news agency.
</P>
<P>
Vdhed Ahyndov, the state adviser of economic policy, told a
news conference in Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan, that the
national economic situation was sound with increases showing up in
all products, including machine building and in the metallurgical
industry.
</P>
<P>
The foreign trade situation improved greatly during the first
five months of this year, while the budget deficit accounted for
1.6 percent of GDP, Ahyndov told the reporters.
</P>
<P>
The trade surplus reached 53 million U.S. dollars in the half
year, compared with the trade deficit of 150 million dollars last
year.
</P>
<P>
Share holding in industrial enterprises and reform of the
private process were accelerated by a big margin because of a
sharp increase in investment. The real income of residents
increased by 35 percent against the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Located south of the Caucasus, Azerbaijan is a state of the
Commonwealth of Independent States. The output of the country

<P>
WASHINGTON, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Former world number one Andre
Agassi was upset in his return to the court when he was eliminated
by fellow Doug Flach in the second round of the Washington Classic
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
After a hiatus of 2 and a half months, Agassi, a three-time
winner here, tried to shrug off his sluggish slate of the season
but only faced a humiliating defeat against 174th-ranked Flach.
</P>
<P>
Flach nipped the former top player 2-6, 6-4, 6-4. He also
pulled down Agassi last year in the first round at Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
Agassi, who was sidelined by a sore right wrist, has lost seven
of his past eight ATP matches, fallen to 31st in rankings and not
played since a May 1 loss to Sweden's Magnus Norman in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
On April 19, Agassi got married to actress Brooke Shields, but
suffered the injury 12 days later which kept him away from the
French Open and Wimbledon.

<HEADLINE> Kuchma Names New Prime Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma on
Wednesday formally named Valery Pustovoitenko as the new prime
minister after the parliament adopted his candidacy by a vote of
226 to 91.
</P>
<P>
Pustovoitenko will replace Pavel Lazarenko, who resigned two
weeks ago for "health reasons."
</P>
<P>
As the seventh prime minister in Ukraine's six-year
independence, and the fourth since Kuchma's presidency began in
July 1994, Pustovoitenko showed great confidence in the new job.
</P>
<P>
He said:"Frequent change of prime ministers has ignited intense
political fighting in the country. I'm prepared for that.,"
</P>
<P>
He pledged a good relationship between the government and the
parliament, and consultations and discussions with political
parties on social and economic development plans.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the parliament session, Kuchma said Pustovoitenko
was experienced in production management and administration as he
had worked in the government for four years.
</P>
<P>
Pustovoitenko, 50, has been the minister of cabinet since 1993,
and once held several local positions in the Dnepropetrovsk Oblast
for a number of years.
</P>
<P>
The major task before the new prime minister following his
appointment is to form a new government. This is no easy job as he
has to consider fully the interests of all the political parties
in the parliament while maintaining national benefits as
instructed by Kuchma.
</P>
<P>
Parliament Speaker Alexander Moroz warned Pustovoitenko to
forget his membership in the People's Democratic Party
(PDP). Pustovoitenko, who served as member of both the Political
Committee and Political Executive Committee of the PDP, pledged to
quit his position in the party if necessary.
</P>
<P>
The toughest task for the new prime minister, however, is to
vitalize the nation's stagnant economy, which continues to decline
 -- and has cost the careers of a prime minister and a deputy
prime minister this year.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEGUCIGALPA, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Honduras has to continue free
trade negotiations with Mexico, otherwise, the country would
remain at a disadvantageous place in Central America, Economy
Minister Fernando Garcia said today.
</P>
<P>
Mexico and the Central America's Northern Triangle countries --
Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador -- have been negotiating for a
free trade agreement (FTA) for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
Guatemala and El Salvador will soon sign the agreement with
Mexico and that would produce an economic triangle against
Honduras, Garcia said.
</P>
<P>
He warned that Honduras runs the risk of disappearing from a
trade map of the Central America.
</P>
<P>
"we cannot remain isolated from the Central American trade
system," the economy minister added.
</P>
<P>
A considerable group of Honduran businessmen is opposed to the
signing of an FTA with Mexico. They said they are not ready to
compete with their Mexican counterparts.

<HEADLINE> State polyurethane Sector Seeks Foreign Partners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 17 (Xinhua) -- China and foreign chemical
companies plan to develop China's polyurethane sector to meet
demand in the mainland's auto and electric appliance market,
today's "China Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
Polyurethane, a synthetic resin, is used in elastic components
of motor vehicles, packages, building materials and as insulation
foam in refrigerators. It can also be used to make synthetic fibre
and rubber.
</P>
<P>
Last year, China produced 445,000 tons of polyurethane, nearly
five times the amount in 1989. The production of polyurethane
worldwide was 6.5 million tons, up 3 percent from the previous
year.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Xu Guide, director of China Polyurethane
Industry Assn as saying that the total volume of products in China
made from polyurethane will reach roughly 700,000 tons a year by
the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
But lack of money in the polyurethane sector is forcing domestic
polyurethane makers to seek foreign partners.
</P>
<P>
The US-based Dow Chemical Co. and Britain-based Imperial
Chemical Inc. have already invested in China. Other prospective
investors include BASF and Bayer of Germany, Ancro Chemical of the
US, and Shell of Holland.

<P>
SOFIA, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Sofia will play the host to the
World Modern Pentathlon Championship slated from July 28 to August
3 with the participation of 220 athletes from 11 countries and
regions.
</P>
<P>
The semifinals of both the men's and women's events will be
played on July 29-30, with the top 32 athletes advancing to the
finals slated on July 31 to August 1.
</P>
<P>
On August 2-3, three-member teams will compete for the team
titles, featuring the top 15 countries in the world rankings and
the host.
</P>
<P>
"The Bulgarian team was formed comparatively late and consists
of young athletes, with the oldest at the age of 21. Most of them
have no international experience and we have set a modest aim to
make the finals," said Roumen Dimitrov, secretary general of the
Modern Pentathlon Federation.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Businessmen Hail Government's Trade Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's business community
has welcomed the government's new export-oriented trade policy for
the 1997-98 fiscal year announced Wednesday by Commerce Minister
Ishaq Dar.
</P>
<P>
President of the Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry
(KCCI) Mian Shahzada Alam termed the new policy as "export
oriented", saying that in the long term it would be helpful for
the country.
</P>
<P>
The KCCI chief welcomed the incentives for the leather industry
by withdrawing five percent customs duty on blue hides and
reducing duty on finishing and patent leather from 45 percent to
15 percent.
</P>
<P>
He said that leather is the second largest exportable item
after textiles and these incentives would help increase the
country's exports.
</P>
<P>
Another Senior KCCI official also welcomed the efforts made by
the government to reduce trade gap and increase exports by 15
percent.
</P>
<P>
He said the value-added sector should be given more incentives
because there is tremendous potential in this sector to increase
exports.

<HEADLINE> WTO Director-General Wishes to Have Short and Simple Jubilee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Director-General of the World Trade
Organization (WTO) Renato Ruggiero said here today that he wishes
to keep the 50th anniversary celebration and the ministerial
conference "short and simple".
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a general council meeting, Ruggiero told
participants that "there has not been yet any general debate about
the scope, agenda or other arrangements", except for the agreement
on the dates for the two events, May 18 to 20, 1998 in Geneva, as
announced before.
</P>
<P>
But "the general view appears to be that the two events should
be kept short and simple", he added.
</P>
<P>
Both WTO members and observers will be invited to the two
events, Ruggiero said, while other intergovernmental organizations
and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) could attend meetings
open to the public on a similar basis to the ministerial
conference in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
The occasion of the 50th anniversary of the multilateral
trading system should be used as "an outstanding opportunity to
reaffirm the continuing relevance and value of the system in a
time of rapid economic change, and to renew our commitment to
keeping it effective in the future to the benefit of all its
members", Ruggiero said.
</P>
<P>
Ruggiero agrees with many members that it would be appropriate
if an event of this importance could be attended at a high
political level, saying that "the participation of senior leaders
would be a very valuable endorsement of what the system means to
the world".
</P>
<P>
Many members prefer that the celebration could be on the third
day (May 20) of the ministerial conference.
</P>
<P>
In order to limit the ministerial conference to one and a half
days, Ruggiero said, "Ministers could be invited to submit
speeches in advance for circulation, as it has been done at all
recent ministerial meetings."
</P>
<P>
As preliminary suggestions, a short formal opening session in
the first morning would be followed in the afternoon by an
informal discussion on a first agenda point, which could be
"Review of Implementation"; another informal discussion in the
following morning on a second point, probably "Future Work
Program"; and a formal closing session in the afternoon of the
second day, which would include a summing up by the chairman.
</P>
<P>
Ruggiero hopes that members will put forward more suggestions
before a consensus is reached.

<HEADLINE> Increasing Overseas Investment in South Chinese City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHUHAI, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The city of Zhuhai, a special
economic zone in south China's Guangdong Province, attracted more
than 1.5 billion US dollars in overseas investment during the
first half of the year.
</P>
<P>
The figure represented a 66 percent increase from the same
period last year.
</P>
<P>
The majority of the funds came from Hong Kong and Macao, but
funds from Japan, the US, Canada, Australia, and Germany are
increasing. There are more than 50 multinational companies that
have invested in the city, which now has more than 250
overseas-funded projects each with an investment of more than 10
million US dollars. This is a substantial rise from 15 in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1990s, overseas funds have accounted for half the
investment in large-scale infrastructure projects, helping build
many bridges, harbors, ports, highways, water and power plants,
and telecom facilities.
</P>
<P>
A new 3.72 million-kw power plant, the largest overseas-funded
project in Zhuhai, has used more than 100 million US dollars of
overseas investment so far.
</P>
<P>
By June the city had actually used more than 4.5 billion US
dollars in overseas investment, helping turn it into a major
Chinese producer of cameras, CD players, VCD players, sewing
machines, and instant noodles.
</P>
<P>
And overseas-funded businesses in Zhuhai now account for
three-fifths of its total exports.

PRAGUE, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Karina Habsudova of Slovakia
secured her quarterfinal berth as her opponent crumpled in the
decider at the Czech Open ladies' clay court tennis tournament on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The third-seeded Habsudova lost the first of the second-round
match 4-6, outplayed Diaz-Oliva 6-2 in the second. She was leading
4-0 in the third set when Diaz-Oliva crumpled.
</P>
<P>
WTA physician Kirsten Patton said Diaz-Oliva who had health
problems before the match, collapsed from exhaustion during the
play.
</P>
<P>
Marion Maruska of Austria also advanced to the quarterfinals
after Laurence Courtois of Belgium retired because of stomach
problems.
</P>
<P>
Romania's Catalina Cristea beat Rene Simpson of Canada in two
straight sets 6-3, 6-3.

<P>
In the last second-round match of the day, the Czech Republic's

<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, July 17 (Xinhua) -- A serious drought has been
continuing since early June in north China's Hebei Province,
damaging crops and causing a shortage of drinking water.
</P>
<P>
Local officials said 3.05 million hectares, or half of the
province's farmland, are suffering from the drought which now has
irreparably damaged 48,000 hectares of crops.
</P>
<P>
The dry spell makes it impossible for farmers to do summer
sowing, worse still, some 340,000 people now have difficulty
finding drinking water.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government is mobilizing all kinds of resources
to fight the drought as there is little hope of adequate rainfall
in the near future to ease the situation.

<HEADLINE> 10,000-Year-Old Skull Fossil Discovered in Central China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, July 17 (Xinhua) -- A fossilized female skull dating
back to the late Pleistocene Period (10,000 to 50,000 years ago)
has been discovered in the suburbs of Wuhan, the capital of
central China's Hubei Province.
</P>
<P>
Archaeologists agree that the fossil is from a 25- to
35-year-old woman. Li Tianyuan, one of the archaeologists, said
that the discovery is the first for the province, and that the
skull has been named "Hanyang Man."
</P>
<P>
"Hanyang men" lived during the same period as "Upper Cave Man"
of Beijing and "Ziyang Man" of Sichuan, Li explained.
</P>
<P>
The discovery proves that human beings were active in Wuhan at
least 10,000 years ago, he noted. Research to determine the exact
year of the skull will be done by scientists from the Archeology
Department of Beijing University, he said.

<HEADLINE> PNG Peace Talks Reported Making Headway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Representatives from Papua New
Guinea island Bougainville have taken tentative steps toward peace
talks with the government, said a report in the local paper "The
Dominion" today.
</P>
<P>
The representatives are now meeting at a military camp near New
Zealand South Island city of Christchurch. The NZ-brokered meeting
brings together representatives from the major factions involved
in the cooper-rich Bougainville island, including those from the
PNG Bougainville Transitional Government and the rebel
Bougainville Interim Government.
</P>
<P>
Gerard Sinato, Premier of the Bougainville Transitional
Government, was quoted as saying that the two sides in the
conflict are nearly ready to meet representatives of PNG's central
government to negotiate a peace accord.
</P>
<P>
Though agreement might be months or even years away, he said,
"people are understanding one another and we should move forward
and New Zealand will be a power broker."
</P>
<P>
Rejecting reports that his group is pushing for independence or
autonomy from the central government, Sinato said "there is no
support for independence at this stage or autonomy at the moment."
</P>
<P>
The report also said that rebel leader Francis Ona, who is not
present at the meeting, has said from Bougainville that he gives
qualified backing to peace talks but the only acceptable outcome
would be a referendum on independence.
</P>
<P>
But Sinato said the sides at the talks have expressed no
support for independence or autonomy yet.
</P>
<P>
"At this stage they have not come up to any decision. Before
that is reached, later at another place, it will be talked about
with the national government."

<HEADLINE> UN Agencies Support Annan's Reform Proposals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations agencies
welcomed and voiced full support for the U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan's reform proposals announced before the General
Assembly this morning.
</P>
<P>
The Administrator of the United Nations Development
Program(UNDP)James Gustave Speth described Annan's reform
proposals as far-reaching, saying:" I strongly support the
Secretary-General's initiatives because they will strengthen and
streamline the UN on every front--peace and security, human
rights, development cooperation, humanitarian affairs and economic
and social affairs."
</P>
<P>
"The renewed UN system sought by the Secretary-General will
become both more effective and more efficient," said the
administrator.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Speth said he was looking forward to the speedy
implementation of these reforms on collaboration with other UN
developing Agencies. "The Secretary-General's proposals have taken
the UN a major step forward toward a renewed world organization
that will become a modern and powerful force for realizing the
goal of global human security."
</P>
<P>
Sadik Nafis, Executive Director of the United Nations
Population Fund (UNFPA) warmly welcomed and fully supported the
Secretary-General's reform proposals as they would affect UNFPA,
saying:"They will contribute to a more effective United Nations
presence in developing countries, enhence the coherence and the
impact of United Nations support for the development and encourage
an increased flow of sources for development, both internal and
external."
</P>
<P>
"The proposed reforms will permit the development work of the
United Nations system to be seen as parts of an integrated whole
rather than as the separate efforts of individual funds and
program," said Dr. Sadik.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, United Nations Environment Program
(UNEP)welcomed the Secretary-General's reform proposals, saying
the Secretary-General's assignment of high priority to the
environment agency of the world community would energize a
transformation already underway.
</P>
<P>
"The reforms announced today have taken into account the
outcomes of the Nineteenth Session of UNEP's Governing Council as
well as the recent UN General Assembly's Special Session in New
York," said UNEP.
</P>
<P>
"The full support of the Secretary-General will take us the
next step in achieving coherence within the United Nations system,
resonance with the expectations of civil society and maintenance
of political vitality. His call for integrity, competence and
efficiency in management reform will encourage us in our results
orientation," said UNEP.
</P>
<P>
Carol Bellamy, Executive Director of United Nations Children's
Fund, affirmed support for the Secretary-General's reforms,
saying:"The bold recommendations grow out of a vision of a United
Nations family dedicated to the most effective possible service to
humanity, especially the world's children."
</P>
<P>
"The Secretary-General represented the General Assembly with a
historic document that will help guide the course of the United
Nations and all its parts to the next century. We applaud him for
his courageous and transforming proposals and look forward to the
General Assembly's upcoming discussion and action," said Bellamy.

<HEADLINE> Annan's UN Reform Proposals Appreciated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Representatives of
different regions, countries and UN agencies today expressed
appreciation to Secretary-General Kofi Annan's UN reform
proposals.
</P>
<P>
Jacob Wilmot of Ghana, on behalf of the African states, said
that the overall aim of reform was to make the Organization more
efficient, relevant and effective to be able to fulfil better its
core principles and purposes of promoting peace and security,
economic prosperity, social progress, humanitarian assistance and
overall development; and also to deal with current and future
challenges as the international community entered the new
millennium.
</P>
<P>
It was incumbent upon all member states to respond to the
Secretary-General's initiative by providing him with clear and
coherent policy guidance in the implementation of the proposals.
That should also be done in time, in order not to lose the
momentum, he added.
</P>
<P>
Jean-Louis Wolzfeld of Luxembourg, on behalf of the European
Union and 10 other countries, said that reform was not about
cost-cutting, but rather about enabling the United Nations to meet
its responsibilities. Its objective should be to increase the
Organization's unity of purpose, as well as its ability to respond
flexibly. He was fully committed to making the Organization more
in tune with the existing trends in international relations.
</P>
<P>
Sergey Lavrov of Russia, on behalf of the Eastern European
group, said that consideration of the reform proposals would allow
member states to continue their dialogue with the Secretariat. The
reforms' success would depend on the support they received from
member states. No reforms to strengthen the Organization could be
effective without unconditional support by member states. After
the proposals were considered, an appropriate mechanism should be
established to consider them.
</P>
<P>
Representatives on behalf of Asian countries and of the Latin
American and Caribbean group said that the proposals would be
forwarded to the respective capitals for thorough consideration in
addition to expressing appreciation to the proposals.
</P>
<P>
Bill Richardson of the United States said that when the
Secretary-General had announced his initial reform blueprint in
March, the United States had welcomed it wholeheartedly. Today, he
was pleased to see the Secretary-General's carefully considered
"track two" proposals. He pledged the United States' full support
for making the reform process effective.
</P>
<P>
Chiefs of the United Nations Development Program, Environment
Program, Children's Fund and Population Fund also issued
statement, expressing their support for the reform proposals.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Acting Solicitor General Walter
Dellinger announced Wednesday he will return to teach at Duke
University Law School by September 1.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno described
Dellinger as a "splendid public servant."
</P>
<P>
In his announcement, Dellinger says, "I will always be grateful
to the president for giving me the opportunity to serve in the two
most interesting jobs a lawyer could possibly have. And I will
always cherish my friendship with Janet Reno, who has led this
department with great integrity and with an insistence on doing
the right thing every time."
</P>
<P>
Dellinger came to the Justice Department four years ago as
Clinton's nominee for assistant attorney general in charge of the
Office of Legal Counsel. As such, he acted as the administration's
chief source of legal advice.
</P>
<P>
Reno named him acting solicitor general last year, and he
argued the government's cases before the Supreme Court, but the
president did not send him name to the Senate as a permanent
choice.
</P>
<P>
Dellinger still plans to argue for the proposed Food and Drug
Administration regulation of nicotine and tobacco products before
an appellate court on August 11.

<HEADLINE> Dow Surpasses 8,000 Mark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The Dow Jones industrial average
pierced through 8,000 points today as a flood of more good news on
company profits, inflation and interest rates came out.
</P>
<P>
On Wall Street, the Dow rose by 63.17 to 8,038.88. The Dow has
already gained more than 1,500 points, or about 24 percent this
year, more than twice what most experts had predicted for all of
1997. By closing above 8,000, the famed market measure has now
doubled from 4,000 in less than 2 years and a half.
</P>
<P>
Other popular market measures also pushed further into record
territory as interest rates sank to their lowest level since
December in the bond market after the Labor Department reported
that consumer prices inched only 0.1 percent higher last month,
holding the inflation rate for the first half of the year to just
1.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite index posted its biggest one-day point
gain ever, rising 38.52, or 2.5 percent, to 1,580.63. Over the
past 10 sessions, the Nasdaq has risen 142.38 points, or nearly 10
percent.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by more than a 2-to-1
margin on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume totaled 646.00
million shares, the fifth busiest day in the exchange's history.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock list rose 10.80 to 936.56, the
NYSE composite index rose 4.25 to 485.24, and the American Stock
Exchange composite index rose 3.08 to 638.03.
</P>
<P>
The second-quarter company earnings have turned better. The
biggest earnings news came late Tuesday from Intel, whose
better-than-expected results energized the technology sector today
and boosted the Nasdaq composite index to its 10th straight record
high.

<HEADLINE> Irish PM Ahern Deeply Unhappy about Haughey's Conduct </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern
said in Dublin today that he was "deeply unhappy" about the
conduct of former Irish prime minister Charlie Haughey, who had
misled a tribunal over receiving a large sum of cash from an Irish
tycoon.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in an interview with Ireland's state radio, Ahern
said: "I am deeply unhappy with what I heard from yesterday. I'm
afraid it revealed standards of conduct that are unacceptable from
one of the most capable leaders this country has seen."
</P>
<P>
This was Ahern's first comment since Haughey, who had been
Irish prime minister between 1979 and 1992, confessed on Tuesday
that he was sorry for previously denying that he had received 1.3
million Irish pounds (about 2 million U.S. dollars) from
businessman Ben Dunne.
</P>
<P>
Ahern noted that he would await the findings of the tribunal
before deciding whether further inquiry was needed into
allegations of corruption in the political establishment.
</P>
<P>
"My government is committed to implementing the (tribunal)
findings and if there are other matters which the tribunal
believes require investigating, if the truthfulness and integrity
don't add up any more, then they'll have to be further
investigated," he said.

<HEADLINE> Greece to Implement Austere Fiscal Policy in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The Greek government would
implement an austere fiscal policy next year to make preparations
for the country's entry into the European Economic and Monetary
Union (EMU), a Greek government official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters, Yiannos Papantoniou, minister of
National Economy and Finance, said that for the Greek economy,
1998 would be "a tough year" because participation in the single
European currency would depend on achieving targets set in the
Greek government's program to converge with other European Union
(EU) countries.
</P>
<P>
The target of the Greek government was to reduce inflation to
below 3.0 percent from the current 5.5 percent and adjust fiscal
policy to strict provisions contained in the convergence program,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The budget deficit, he predicted, would shrink to 4.2 percent
of gross domestic product this year and that economic growth would
accelerate to 3.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Maastricht criteria cover inflation, the budget deficit and
public debt, as well as interest rates and exchange rate
stability.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Italy are the only two EU members that will not be
able to join the launch of the single currency in 1999 because of
excessive budget deficits, according to a report issued by
European Commission recently.
</P>
<P>
The economy ministry says that Greece will try to meet the
convergence criteria by the end of 1998, one year later than most
EU members. But most analysts agree that Greece is not likely to
do so before 1999 at the earliest.
</P>
<P>
The Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis says that his country
will definitely qualify by 1999.
</P>
<P>
The EU's leaders will decide in May 1998 which countries will
qualify for participation in the single currency based on their
economic performance in 1997 and whether it can be sustained.

<HEADLINE> German Unemployment Has Peaked, Official Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Germany's unemployment has reached
its peak and is likely to average under 4.3 million in 1997,
President of the German Federal Labour Office Bernhard Jagoda said
today.
</P>
<P>
"We are seeing the first signs of stabilization," Jagoda said
in an interview with the German daily Die Welt. But he also
stressed that it was premature to predict when a real upturn in
employment would actually take place.
</P>
<P>
The number of people out of work in Germany reached 4.374
million in June for a rate of 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
The costs induced by the huge unemployment have put a heavy
financial burden on the German government as it is struggling to
cut budget deficit and national debt in a bid to meet the European
Union requirements for joining the planned single European
currency, the Euro.
</P>
<P>
Under a revised budget for 1997, the government plans to spend
149.06 billion marks (85.5 billion U.S. dollars) in payments for
the jobless people this year.
