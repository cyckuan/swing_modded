<HEADLINE> Students Throughout Iran Condemn Police Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Students throughout Iran on Sunday
condemned the recent attack by the country's
conservative-dominated security forces (police) on Tehran
University dormitory.
</P>
<P>
According to the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA), students
in various cities across the country issued statements and held
demonstrations, calling for punishment on those who provoked the
attack.
</P>
<P>
During the gathering of students on the Tabriz University
campus in northwestern East Azarbaijan province, some scuffles
occurred between students and another group on Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
Some people were injured in the scuffles which ended after the
mediation of university officials, IRNA said.
</P>
<P>
Similar demonstrations were held in Mashhad in northeastern
Khorasan province, Isfahan in the central Isfahan province and
Shiraz in the southern Fars province.
</P>
<P>
In Tehran, students continued their protest, but limited their
demonstrations inside the Tehran University dormitory in order to
avoid clashes and tensions.
</P>
<P>
Iranian cabinet on Sunday also deplored the incident and
expressed hope that "pressure groups" and advocates of violent
acts would be shortly identified and punished.
</P>
<P>
A number of cabinet members paid visits to the Tehran
University dormitory and held talks with students, calling on
them to show respect for law and order.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian anti-riot police forced into the Tehran University
dormitory on Thursday night, storming students' hostels and
beating up students.
</P>
<P>
Iran's Supreme National Security Council (SNSC) announced on
Sunday that no student was killed in the attack, but only a
military officer, who was visiting his friends at the dormitory,
was killed.
</P>
<P>
The SNSC did not mention the number of the injured, but said
that all the 200 students arrested have been released.
</P>
<P>
The SNSC also stated that the commanders responsible for the
attack would be dismissed and punished according to law.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, deputy commander of the security forces Brigadier
General Mohssen Ansari said on Sunday that the attack on students
on Thursday was ordered by the sub-commanders without order from
their superior officers.
</P>
<P>
He said that two sub-commanders of Tehran security forces, who
had been found guilty for incapacity and failing to control their
sub-officers, had been reported to the SNSC.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Urges Youth Not to Marry at Early Age </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 11 (Xinhua) - Tanzania called on the youth
Sunday not to marry at a premature age so that the fast growing
birth rate of the country could be brought under control.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a gathering in celebration of the World Population
Day in Zanzibar at a national level, Zanzibar's Deputy Chief
Minister Omar Ramadhani Mapuri said many young people start to
marry and bear children at early ages, which lead to big family
sizes and failure in the betterment of livelihood.
</P>
<P>
"Marrying at 14 years or below gives a chance of having a big
number of children than marrying at 25," Mapuri said.
</P>
<P>
Mapuri, who is also the isles' Minister for Education, said
delays in having children could also enable youths to complete
their studies and be engaged in production activities.
</P>
<P>
He said it is a pity that many girls in Tanzania are forced to
drop out of school because of unwanted pregnancies, said Mapuri.
</P>
<P>
The official also warned that premature sexual activities
might put the youths at a greater risk of contracting diseases
such as AIDS.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, young parents should plan the size of their
families in order to guarantee the health and education of their
children, Mapuri said. At present, the population of Tanzania
stands at 30 million, with an annual growth rate of 2.8 percent,
which is not proportionate with an economic growth rate of between
three and four percent.
</P>
<P>
Population pressures on the available resources and services
have a negative impact on social development, causing problems of
urban migration, unemployment, and crimes like baby dumping,
robbery and drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania's Minister of State Nassor Malocho, who was also
present at the celebration activities said the people have the
responsibility of caring for their families and that the
government's role is to create a conducive environment.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Fund for Population (UNFPA)'s representative
in Tanzania Teferi Seyoum also attended the function.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Hopes U.S. to Reverse Sidon Travel Caution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon Sunday expressed hope that
the United States would reconsider its recent announcement urging
U.S. citizens to avoid travelling to Lebanon's southern biggest
city of Sidon.
</P>
<P>
"We are astonished about the notice issued by the U.S. State
Department that warned its citizens of the risks of travel to
Sidon," Prime Minister Salim Hoss told the country's official
National News Agency.
</P>
<P>
"The security and stability in Sidon is the same with the
country's other areas and there are no difference," Hoss added.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the U.S. State Department said in a notice
that the security in Sidon had "recently deteriorated, including
the issuance from the Sidon area of an anti-American threat
of undetermined credibility."
</P>
<P>
Americans "are cautioned to avoid travel into Sidon and
adjacent Palestinian refugee camps until the security environment
stablizes," the notice said.
</P>
<P>
But it didn't give specific details or say who is suspected of
issuing the threat.
</P>
<P>
About 10 day ago, Lebanese press reported that an unknown group
calling itself "Army to Liberate the Shrines, Lebanon
Principality" distributed a leaflet in Sidon openly calling for
the killing of U.S. Ambassador David Satterfield in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The leaflet said Satterfield had been "constantly defending
his Jewish masters and accusing those who are defending their
land of being the aggressor."

that process has begun," White House spokesman Barry Toiv said.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, who was sworn into office

Toiv would not comment on specifics of the talks between the
two leaders.
</P>
<P>
Barak is scheduled to come to the United States this week and
was expected to meet Clinton at the White House Thursday.

TUNIS, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Tunisian President Zine Al-Abidine
Bin Ali left here Sunday afternoon for Algiers, capital of
Algeria, to attend the 53th summit of the Organization of African
Unity (OAU) due to start on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Bin Ali is accompanied by former Tanzanian president Julius
Kambarage Nyerere who stopped over in Tunis on his way to Algiers,
the Tunisia-Africa News Agency reported.

he handed over the presidency of the continental body to Ethiopian
Prime Minister Meles Zenawi.

The event will enable Bin Ali to meet with Algerian President
Abdelaziz Bouteflika, the first of its kind since the latter took
office in April, said a Tunisian Foreign Ministry spokesman on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will have positive impacts on the bilateral ties

<HEADLINE> Barak, Arafat Promise to Advance Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
EREZ CROSSING, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak and Palestinian National Authority (PNA) Chairman Yasser
Arafat Sunday held their first meeting since the Israeli election
in May and promised to work together to overcome obstacles in
peacemaking.
</P>
<P>
The two sides did not reach any agreement on the 80-minute
talks at the border crossing between Israel and the
Palestinian-ruled Gaza Strip, but they described the meeting as
"constructive and fruitful."
</P>
<P>
"Our primary objective is to resume the mutual trust which is
so crucial to any possibility of security agreement," Barak told
a joint news conference after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
"We are determined to find a way to overcome all the obstacles
and to coordinate under mutual understanding the way we move
forward toward peace," he said.
</P>
<P>
Barak promised that his government will implement the
U.S.-brokered Wye deal, which was signed and then frozen by the
hard-line former prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu last year.
</P>
<P>
But he said he hopes the two sides could find ways to combine
the implementation of the Wye agreement with the final status
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
"We will implement Wye and we will shape and coordinate with
the chairman and the Palestinian (National) Authority the way by
which the advancement of the permanent status negotiations will
be combined with the implementation of the Wye agreement," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Local media reports said that Barak wants to bypass parts of
the Wye agreement because it involves the dismantling of Jewish
settlements, a sensitive issue in Israel.
</P>
<P>
These reports suggested that he might try to persuade Arafat
to give up on the Wye deal in exchange for Israeli recognition of
a Palestinian state, which he said last week is a "de facto"
existence.
</P>
<P>
In response, Arafat said the Palestinians expect the Israeli
government to "carry out all of its obligations pertaining to the
Wye agreements."
</P>
<P>
He said there is no contradiction between implementing the Wye
agreement and the final status negotiations.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of Jewish settlements, Barak reiterated his
position that his government would not build new settlement. He
has said that he would not dismantle existing settlements at
once.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the settlement activities as "illegal and
destructive," Arafat called on the Barak government to halt the
building of new settlements and the expansion of existing ones.
</P>
<P>
He expressed confidence that Barak will push forward the peace
process initiated by the late Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak
Rabin.
</P>
<P>
"The recent Israeli election raised wide hopes for the
achievement of comprehensive peace in the region," he told the
news conference.
</P>
<P>
Calling Barak a "friend and partner," Arafat said that "I am
confident today that together we can give peace process seriously
and truly a chance it deserves."
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leader also promised to fulfill Palestinian
obligations under signed agreements, including fighting
terrorism. "It's time to put an end to the cycle of violence and
confrontation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Barak and Arafat smiled and shook hands warmly before entering
a white two-story building, the liaision office between Israel
and the Palestinians, for talks.
</P>
<P>
This was the second of a series of meetings between Barak and
Arab leaders since he took office last Tuesday. He held talks with
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in the Egyptian coastal
city of Alexandria Friday.
</P>
<P>
He will travel to Jordan Tuesday to meet Jordan's King
Abdullah before leaving for Washington for talks with President
Bill Clinton Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials have said that the main aim of the round of
talks is to rebuild confidence and mutual trust between Israel
and its Arab neighbors after being destroyed in the last three
years.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian security forces on
Sunday seized 2,059 kilograms of narcotics in Torbat-e Jam,
northeastern province of Khorasan.
</P>
<P>
The forces said that the drugs included 2,056 kilograms of
opium and three kilograms of heroin, the Islamic Republic News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Clashes erupted between the security forces and drug smugglers
in a border height 60 kilometers from Torbat-e Jam, the report
said. The clashes lasted for two hours and the smugglers escaped
the scene leaving behind the haul.
</P>
<P>
Iran launched large-scale anti-drug campaigns after the Iranian
Majlis (parliament) passed a strict anti-drug law in 1989 and
the number of confiscated narcotics increased drastically in
recent years with 195 tons in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Mohammad Fallah, secretary of anti-drug headquarters at the

<HEADLINE> Nepal to Launch Nationwide Poverty Reduction Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Nepali Finance Minister Mahesh
Acharya said here Sunday that from the 1999/2000 fiscal year
starting mid-July, a nationwide poverty reduction campaign will be
launched targeted to the absolutely poor people.
</P>
<P>
Presenting to the parliament the draft budget for the new
fiscal year, Acharya said that these people are those who are
deprived of minimum basic necessities like cloth, shelter, food,
basic health services and education and those who have no access
to land, capital and skills employment opportunities.
</P>
<P>
He said that about 100 absolute poor families from each of the
205 constituencies in the kingdom will be identified for receiving
a loan up to 30,000 rupees (440 U.S. dollars) per family at a 5
percent interest rate so that they can have access to integrated
facilities of shelter, income generating scheme or livestock
asset, educational opportunity and health facilities for their
children.
</P>
<P>
"The program will contribute to get rid from the vicious circle
of poverty of about 200,000 absolutely poor families," he claimed.
</P>
<P>
He said that in the new fiscal year, a poverty alleviation fund
will also be established to develop resources and enhance
institutional capabilities to directly facilitate the poverty
alleviation program.
</P>
<P>
He said that in addition to the execution of local
infrastructures like small rural road schemes and irrigation
channels that complement production facilities, the fund will be
utilized for the growth of markets through the launching of
cooperatives, training programs and micro financing.
</P>
<P>
"All poverty alleviation-related programs would be integrated
and coordinated through this fund," he added.
</P>
<P>
Besides, a Small Farmer and Cooperative Bank will be
established in the next fiscal year to benefit small farmers and
allocation has been set aside in the budget for the implementation
with full commitment of the "Special Area Program" launched in 25
districts of the country since last year, the finance minister
said.
</P>
<P>
About 42 to 50 percent of the population live below the poverty
line in Nepal. Poverty is extreme in the more remote areas,
particularly in the hills and mountains, where the incidence is as
high as 65 percent, according to the Asian Development Bank.
</P>
<P>
Poverty alleviation has been the primary objective of the
Nepali government's development efforts.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Only Receives Half of Contracted Goods: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has only received 57 percent
of its contracted goods during the past five phases of the
U.N. oil-for-food program, said Iraqi Trade Minister Mohammed
Mehdi Saleh on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The minister said in a statement that Iraq had so far only
received 4.76 billion U.S. dollars worth of contracted items out
of the total amount of 8 billion dollars under the oil-for-food
deal, the Iraqi News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Saleh accused the U.S. and British envoys with the
U.N. Sanctions Committee of impeding or holding Iraqi contracts,
and held them responsible for delaying the arrival of the
contracted items.
</P>
<P>
He said that those contracted items usually arrived in Iraq
eight months after contracts had been signed with world companies.
</P>
<P>
Under the oil-for-food deal which came into force in December
1996, Iraq is allowed to export limited amount of oil in every six
months to buy food, medicine and other humanitarian supplies for
its nearly 24 million people.
</P>
<P>
The program, now in its sixth phase which started from May 25,
allowed Iraq to export 2 billion dollars of oil in the first three
phases, and the ceiling has been raised to 5.2 billion dollars as
of the fourth phase.
</P>
<P>
Saleh said the program failed to alleviate the sufferings of
the Iraqi people due to the continuation of the nearly
nine-year-old U.N. sanctions imposed on the country.
</P>
<P>
He said under the sixth phase of the deal, 1.37 billion
dollars are allocated for food and health sector, 440 million
dollars for electricity, 274 million dollars for agriculture and
irrigation, 127 million dollars for education, 300 million dollars
for oil sector, 120 million dollars for transport and
communications.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the fact that the contracts Iraq signed with
Arab countries in the past five phases accounted for half of the
total Iraqi contracts reflected Iraq's keenness to enhance trade
relations with Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
He said that the world community suffered a total loss of 140
billion dollars in trade with Baghdad as a result of the
U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq after its invasion of Kuwait in
1990.

country's security forces (police).
</P>
<P>
The SNSC was quoted by the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA)
as saying that only one military officer who spent his holidays at
the dormitory with his friends was killed in the clashes between
students and policemen on Thursday and Friday.
</P>
<P>
Eye-witnesses said earlier that seven students were killed, 300
injured and 500 arrested in the incident which was triggered by a
rally protesting the newly-approved press law and the ban on the
leading moderate daily Salam (Hello).
</P>
<P>
The SNSC said in a statement that only 200 students were
arrested and they have been released so far.
</P>
<P>
During the attack, one police officer, one student and one
Tehran citizen were injured by three pistol bullets, it said, and
the Intelligence Ministry would conduct further investigation on
the shooting.
</P>
<P>
The SNSC also announced that the Tehran police commander, only
named as Ahmadi, and his deputy, who were found to be responsible
for the attack on students, would be dismissed and handed over to
the judiciary for investigation.
</P>
<P>
It also said that seven people have been arrested in
connection with the incident.
</P>
<P>
Iran's conservative-dominated police on Thursday night forced
into the Tehran University dormitory and stormed students'
hostels in defiance of the opposition of Tehran University
authorities.
</P>
<P>
Following the incident, Iranian Minister of Higher Education
Mostafa Moin and Chancellor of Tehran University Mansour Khalili
Iraqi submitted their resignations protesting the attacks.
</P>
<P>
However, President Mohammad Khatami on Sunday rejected Moin's
resignation and called on him to continue his work.
</P>
<P>
Condemning the crackdown, President Khatami expressed his
apology over the incident and promised to probe into the issue.
</P>
<P>
However, IRNA said that students in Tehran and several Iranian
cities on Sunday continued their protests.
</P>
<P>
The students called for identification and punishment of those
responsible for the crackdown, release of the arrested students,
transfer the authority of commanding police to the Interior
Ministry and dismissal of the police commander.
</P>
<P>
The students warned to continue their protest until their
demands were met.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Tehran University presiding board and deans of its
different colleges announced to stage a sit-in Monday morning at
the university mosque to protest the crackdown.

<HEADLINE> Barak, Arafat Promise to Advance Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
EREZ CROSSING, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak and Palestinian National Authority (PNA) Chairman Yasser
Arafat Sunday held their first meeting since the Israeli election
in May and promised to work together to overcome obstacles in
peacemaking.
</P>
<P>
The two sides did not reach any agreement on the 80-minute
talks at the border crossing between Israel and the
Palestinian-ruled Gaza Strip, but they described the meeting as
"constructive and fruitful."
</P>
<P>
"Our primary objective is to resume the mutual trust which is
so crucial to any possibility of security agreement," Barak told
a joint news conference after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
"We are determined to find a way to overcome all the obstacles
and to coordinate under mutual understanding the way we move
forward toward peace," he said.
</P>
<P>
Barak promised that his government will implement the
U.S.-brokered Wye deal, which was signed and then frozen by the
hard-line former prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu last year.
</P>
<P>
But he said he hopes the two sides could find ways to combine
the implementation of the Wye agreement with the final status
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
"We will implement Wye and we will shape and coordinate with
the chairman and the Palestinian (National) Authority the way by
which the advancement of the permanent status negotiations will
be combined with the implementation of the Wye agreement," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Local media reports said that Barak wants to bypass parts of
the Wye agreement because it involves the dismantling of Jewish
settlements, a sensitive issue in Israel.
</P>
<P>
These reports suggested that he might try to persuade Arafat
to give up on the Wye deal in exchange for Israeli recognition of
a Palestinian state, which he said last week is a "de facto"
existence.
</P>
<P>
In response, Arafat said the Palestinians expect the Israeli
government to "carry out all of its obligations pertaining to the
Wye agreements."
</P>
<P>
He said there is no contradiction between implementing the Wye
agreement and the final status negotiations.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of Jewish settlements, Barak reiterated his
position that his government would not build new settlement. He
has said that he would not dismantle existing settlements at
once.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the settlement activities as "illegal and
destructive," Arafat called on the Barak government to halt the
building of new settlements and the expansion of existing ones.
</P>
<P>
He expressed confidence that Barak will push forward the peace
process initiated by the late Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak
Rabin.
</P>
<P>
"The recent Israeli election raised wide hopes for the
achievement of comprehensive peace in the region," he told the
news conference.
</P>
<P>
Calling Barak a "friend and partner," Arafat said that "I am
confident today that together we can give peace process seriously
and truly a chance it deserves."
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leader also promised to fulfill Palestinian
obligations under signed agreements, including fighting
terrorism. "It's time to put an end to the cycle of violence and
confrontation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Barak and Arafat smiled and shook hands warmly before entering
a white two-story building, the liaision office between Israel
and the Palestinians, for talks.
</P>
<P>
This was the second of a series of meetings between Barak and
Arab leaders since he took office last Tuesday. He held talks with
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in the Egyptian coastal
city of Alexandria Friday.
</P>
<P>
He will travel to Jordan Tuesday to meet Jordan's King
Abdullah before leaving for Washington for talks with President
Bill Clinton Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials have said that the main aim of the round of
talks is to rebuild confidence and mutual trust between Israel
and its Arab neighbors after being destroyed in the last three
years.

have joined the extension program, will be provided with
fertilizer and high-yield seeds by the government.

the coming agricultural season, the general manager added.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Intruders Withdrawing: Indian Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 11 (Xinhua) -- India said on Sunday that there
was evidence of Pakistani intruders withdrawing from Kargil sector
of Kashmir while its army was poised for a decisive thrust with
almost all enemy positions in Drass and Batalik cleared of the
infiltrators.
</P>
<P>
"We have some evidence of withdrawal already taking place,"
National Security Adviser Brajesh Mishra told reporters here
today, adding that the withdrawal was likely to be completed in a
week.
</P>
<P>
Mishra's remarks came in the wake of talks between directors
general of military operations (DGMOs) of India and Pakistan
earlier today, the first since India launched large-scale military
operation in Kargil on May 8.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here said that the meeting, which took place
at Attari near the international border, was convened at the
request of the Pakistan government.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan has been reported to have decided to immediately
restore the high level contacts with India and offer in this
regard has been sent to New Delhi by its High Commissioner Ashraf
Jehangir Qazi.
</P>
<P>

the two countries agreed on a "disengagement" in Kargil.

proposal by Pakistan for high-level talks, an External Affairs
Ministry spokesman R. S. Jassal said here Sunday that he was not
aware of it.
</P>
<P>
Asked if there was any move for a cease-fire in Kargil, the
spokesman said, "Until the last intruder is evicted, our military
operations will continue."

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Tighten Control on Firearms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The South African government
is drafting a bill to tighten control on firearms, but it Sunday
rejected as " nonsense" media reports that the draft legislation
would outlaw nine out of 10 legally owned firearms.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Safety and Security issued a statement in
response to an article in the Sunday Times newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted the South African Gun Owners' Association,
which claims the legislation could drive the arms retail and
manufacturing industries to the wall.
</P>
<P>
The department said: "Because most illegal guns start life as
legal guns, it is necessary to reduce the proliferation of both.
</P>
<P>
"The draft bill also contains new sections to strengthen the
policing and prosecution for illegal possession of guns."
</P>
<P>
The draft law stipulates that gun licenses are limited to one
person, according to the newspaper report.
</P>
<P>
The license fee also is expected to increase from 50 rand (8.3
U.S. dollars) to 500 rand.
</P>
<P>
According to the draft law, already-licensed gun-owners would
have to reapply for their licenses.
</P>
<P>
All future applicants may be required to undergo psychometric
tests to determine whether the person has the suitable traits to
become a gun owner.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Safety and Security said these tests have
been discussed with experts from Britain and Canada, and their
final inclusion is not clear at this stage.
</P>
<P>
"The department has been reluctant to release any drafts before
the bill has been approved by cabinet, but decided to do so
because it wished to ensure that the final bill represents the
best possible controls while interfering as little as possible
with bona fide activities," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The department will not comment further on this bill until it
has been approved by the minister for safety and security and the
cabinet."
</P>
<P>
Anti-gun lobby group, Gun-Free South Africa, welcomed the
legislation, saying it has been asking for this kind of
legislation for a long time.
</P>
<P>
It said almost 31 people die of gunshot wounds everyday.

<HEADLINE> More Than 1 Mln Afghans Need Food Aid: U.N. Agencies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 12 (Xinhua) -- More than 1 million people
in Afghanistan will need relief and rehabilitation assistance over
the next 18 months because of a sharp reduction in cereal
production in the country this year, said a latest report by two
United Nations food aid agencies.
</P>
<P>
The report by the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
and the World Food Program (WFP) said that cereal production is
expected to fall 16 percent to 3.24 million tons in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Based on a recent crop and food supply assessment mission sent
by the FAO and the WFP to the West Asian country, the report said
that Afghanistan's cereal production was sharply reduced this year
by a shortage of irrigation water.
</P>
<P>
Late and erratic spring rains and a high incidence of yellow
rust and sunnpest in some regions also contributed to the fall in
cereal production, the report said.
</P>
<P>
According to the U.N. agencies, food deficits in Afghanistan
have been exacerbated by a trend among farmers to turn their wheat
fields over to the cultivation of such cash crops as onions,

Cereal import requirements for the next 12 months are estimated
at a record 1.1 million tons, but with commercial cereal imports
reaching just 800,000 tons, Afghanistan faces a food shortfall of
323,000 tons, the agencies said.
</P>
<P>
Although the WFP has procured 97,000 tons of emergency food
aid, the remaining deficit will have serious implications for the
poorest and most vulnerable people in a population that is heavily
dependent on food air because of high levels of poverty and
unemployment, the FAO and the WFP said.

MONTEVIDEO, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The Copa America may invite
Japan again in the 40th version of the continental football

<P>
The official said the Copa America organizers was satisfied

<P>
Japan, who had never played in Copa America before, lost 3-2 to
Peru, 4-0 to Paraguay, and drew 1-1 with Bolivia in their three
encounters against the South American countries.

continent.
</P>
<P>
Mexico, the United States and Costa Rica had played in the
competition through invitation since CSAF opened the door to
countries out of South America in 1993.

<HEADLINE> Better Economic Outlook Expected in Hong Kong: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's business confidence
is improving, with a survey showing 52.4 percent of companies
expect an improvement in the economic outlook in the next two
quarters.
</P>
<P>
The latest South China Morning Post-Nomura Business Barometer
shows that the six-month outlook for both listed and private
companies is better, with expectations of improved general
economic conditions, net profit margins and new orders.
</P>
<P>
The survey, covering 144 listed and private companies, found 39.
2 percent of them expect conditions to remain as they are, while
the last such survey in April got only 20.4 percent of companies
that expected an improvement.
</P>
<P>
Non-property investment looks set to rise, with 40 percent of
firms saying they will increase spending and almost 52 percent
saying they will maintain current levels of investment.
</P>
<P>
The survey also found nearly 41 percent of respondents said
they anticipated an increase in new orders, while 26.3 percent
said they would remain the same. However, 29 percent still said
they expected orders to decrease.
</P>
<P>
Listed companies had a slightly more bullish outlook than
private companies, with 60.4 percent saying they envisaged general
economic improvement for the rest of this year, according to the
survey.
</P>
<P>
Property companies were the most upbeat within that group,
while those firms with predominantly mainland-based operations or
controlling shareholders were again the most bearish as concerns
about the Chinese economy continued to weigh heavily.
</P>
<P>
Compared with listed companies, 48.4 percent of the 95 private
company respondents believed conditions would improve, while 41.1
percent said the economic environment would stay the same.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Official Says He's "Shocked" at Lee Teng-hui's Separatist Remarks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Wang Daohan, President of
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS), said
here today that he is shocked by Taiwan's redefinition of the
cross-straits talks as "bilateral talks between two states".
</P>
<P>
The new terminology undermines the foundation for ARATS's
contacts, exchanges and dialogues with Taiwan's Strait Exchange
Foundation (SEF), he said. He is demanding a clarification from
his counterpart Koo Chen-fu, SEF's chairman.
</P>
<P>
Lee Teng-hui of Taiwan has been reported as saying on July 9
that the cross-straits relations should be defined as "state-to-
state relations" and, on July 10, Koo echoed the remarks by saying
that the two sides of the Taiwan Straits are "two independent
political entities" and that the cross-straits talks are "
bilateral talks between two states".
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, Wang said that the "one China"
principle has been the foundation for the cross-straits relations
and it has been also the foundation for the contacts, dialogues,
and negotiations between the ARATS and the SEF.
</P>
<P>
Wang said the ARATS will resolutely guard the "one China"
principle and continue to promote the cross-straits relations
together with the SEF under that principle for the peaceful
reunification of the motherland.

<HEADLINE> Heavy Rainfall Causes Flooding in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 12 (Xinhua) -- An exceptionally heavy rainfall
during the past two days have caused flooding in most of
Bangladesh and worsened the situation in capital Dhaka and the
second largest city of Chittagong, as well as seven districts in
the country.
</P>
<P>
The downpour since last Friday has, to some extent, paralyzed
life in Dhaka, Chittagong and elsewhere in the country, and
several hundred thousand people have been marooned in some
districts due to water-logging in the low-lying areas caused by
the downpour.
</P>
<P>
Chittagong recorded 164 mm rainfall during the past 24 hours
ending 9:00 a.m. Monday and there is forecast for heavy rain in
the next two days, the city met office said.
</P>
<P>
Low-lying areas in the northwestern district of Kurigram have
gone under water while 15,000 people remained marooned for the
past three days, press reports said.
</P>
<P>
The overall flood situation in the country deteriorated further
Sunday inundating vast low-lying areas due to the heavy downpour
and onrush of waters from the upstream, according the Met Office
(MO).
</P>
<P>
The country on average experienced 90 mm rainfall Sunday while
rainfall recorded in the Dhaka city was 96 mm, the MO said.
</P>
<P>
The heaviest rainfall was recorded in the southeastern district
of Comilla -- 270 mm, which was followed by 203 mm and 165 mm at
the southeastern and northwestern districts of Chandpur and
Sunamganj respectively.
</P>
<P>
The inclement weather is continuing Monday, and there is a
possibility of return to normal weather Tuesday, the MO said.

<HEADLINE> Improving Cross-Straits Labor Contracts For Fishermen (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 12 (Xinhua) -- China has decided to increase
controls on cross-straits labor contracts for fishermen after the
killing of 11 mainland crew members on a Taiwanese boat last
February and several other incidents.
</P>
<P>
Those laborers working on Taiwanese boats need to have the
contracts they sign explained and be told how to protect
themselves before they start to work, China says. A Taiwanese sea
captain killed 11 mainlanders in waters near Mauritius last
February. Chinese trade officials say that the mainland was
astonished and indignant about the brutal actions of the Taiwanese
captain.
</P>
<P>
So, companies involved in the fisherman labor service business
on the mainland need to improve management, according to a
circular isssued late June by the Ministry of Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation, the State Council's Taiwan Affairs Office,
and 4 other ministries.
</P>
<P>
The circular says that companies involved in this business will
be reexamined and the qualified companies will be re-issued
licenses. They are being urged to improve management to avoid
further incidents and all new contracts signed with Taiwanese
companies on contract fishermen after May 18 will be suspended and
no new business of this kind will be allowed until the ministry
announces the new list of licensed companies.

<HEADLINE> Cultural Blending Boosts Tourism in Macao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, July 12 (Xinhua) -- A tourism official of Macao said
here Monday that Macao shall try to attract more tourists with its
unique features blending both Chinese and Western cultures.
</P>
<P>
"Gaming has played a significant role in the initial stages of
the development of Macao's tourism industry. Yet, we have always
had a strong conviction that Macao has more to offer the visitors
than just gaming," said Maria Helena, vice-director of the Macao
Government Tourism Office.
</P>
<P>
On behalf of the Tourism Office, Maria Helena talked about
Macao's tourism development to more than 100 participants of the
tourism conference organized by the Pacific Asia Travel
Association. The three-day conference ended Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Only a greater emphasis on cultural contents can establish a
distinctive tourism image of Macao," she noted.
</P>
<P>
Chinese and Portuguese cultures have mixed with each other over
the centuries. On December 20 this year, China will resume
exercise of sovereignty over Macao which is under Portuguese
administration.
</P>
<P>
"The old world charm remains. We can easily take a stroll along
the cobbled streets and admire typical Portuguese mansions and
Chinese temples," Helena said.
</P>
<P>
"The territory is unique because of our rich heritage
accumulated over 400 years of the coexistence of the Portuguese
and the Chinese," she said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Macao is exerting more influence around the world
by hosting a number of international events every year, such as
the music festival, art festival, fireworks display contest, Grand
Prix car-racing and dragon-boat racing, she noted.

<HEADLINE> India Sets Deadline for Intruders to Withdraw </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 12 (Xinhua) -- India set July 16 as the
deadline for intruders from Pakistan to withdraw from Indian side
of Kashmir, a spokesman of the External Affairs Ministry said here
Monday.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting of the Directors General of Military
Operations (DGMOs) of India and Pakistan Sunday, Islamabad was
told that its "forces must withdraw well north of the LoC (line of
control) by the morning of July 16," the spokesman said at the
daily briefing here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Even as Pakistan reportedly agreed to comply with the pullout
schedule, India warned that any intruder found after the deadline
on Indian territory "would be treated as hostile and dealt with
accordingly".
</P>
<P>
Earlier, India announced suspension of air strikes and
scale-down use of certain weapons in Kargil area of Kashmir as
intruders have begun pulling out.
</P>
<P>
While announcing the suspension of air strikes and use of
ground-based weapons during the pullout period, New Delhi
maintained that military operations would continue and there was
no question of withdrawing its forces from Kargil or anywhere
else.
</P>
<P>
The Press Trust of India (PTI) said that Indian army
effectively countered renewed Pakistani shelling in Batalik
Monday, killing 12 enemy soldiers amidst reports of heightened air
activity across the LoC, the de facto border between India and
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Heavy Pakistani artillery shelling continued in Batalik despite
Islamabad's decision to withdraw the intruders, PTI said, adding
that seven Indian soldiers were killed and six wounded in the
shelling.
</P>
<P>
An official press release said Monday that Pakistan army was in
the process of pulling out from pockets in Mushkoh sector of
Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
"Their (the intruders) withdrawal from Drass and Batalik
sectors is of very little consequence since almost all of these
areas have been already cleared" by Indian troops, the release
said.

<HEADLINE> UN Chief Promises Support for African Solutions to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALGIERS, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Secretary-General of the United
Nations Kofi Annan said here Monday that the United States is
along with African nations in their seeking for resolution to
armed conflicts and their struggle for social development.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening of the 35th summit of the Organization
of African Unity (OAU), Annan assured African leaders that Africa
is not alone in meeting the challenges like the resolutions to
armed conflicts, the economic recovery and the impact of AIDS,
among others.
</P>
<P>
While congratulating African leaders on the "encouraging" news
of the conclusion of a peace settlement for Sierra Leone, and the
completion of a cease-fire agreement that promises to end the
fighting in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Annan said that U.N.
will do its part to ensure the effective implementation of these
agreements.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief also mentioned the break in the long stalemate
over the Lockerbie air disaster, adding that thanks should be
given to the full cooperation of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi and
the former South African President Nelson Mandela.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Annan said, deadly conflicts persist in
Angola, the Republic of Congo, and between Ethiopia and Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
In Western Sahara, U.N. officials are continuing their efforts
to arrange a referendum, Annan said, adding that in the Central
African Republic, U.N. has mounted a multi-dimensional
peace-keeping operation responsible for organizing elections,
disarmament and other tasks.
</P>
<P>
The will of the people must be the basis of authority in Africa
and the duly-elected government should not be overthrown by force,
the U.N. chief pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Along with peace, the development of Africa has always been one
of U.N.' s prime concerns as healthy development is the best
long-term conflict prevention, he added.
</P>
<P>
While promising that U.N. and its funds and programs are along
with African countries in their economic development efforts,
Annan also urged that African states should reduce their purchases
of weapons and ammunition to 1.5 percent of their gross national
product (GNP).

<HEADLINE> FM Spokesman on Lee Teng-Hui's Separatist Remarks (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BEIJING, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman
Zhu Bangzao today warned that Lee Teng-hui and the Taiwan
authorities should size up the situation soberly, rein in at the
brink of the precipice and immediately cease all separatist
activities.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the press here, Zhu warned that Lee and
the Taiwan authorities not to underestimate the firm resolve of
the Chinese government to safeguard state sovereignty, dignity and
territorial integration or the courage and strength of the Chinese
people to fight against separation and Taiwan's independence.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said Lee recently declared in an interview with Deutsche
Welle that the Taiwan authorities had defined the cross-Straits
relations as "state-to-state, or at least special state-to-state
relations".
</P>
<P>
It has been echoed by certain persons holding responsible
positions in the relevant departments of the Taiwan authorities,
who have stated that cross-Straits ties have developed from ties
between "two equal political entities" to those between "two
states" and that the cross-Straits talks are "talks between two
states", he noted.

<TEXT>
<P>
There is only one China in the world and Taiwan is part of the
Chinese territory. China's territory and sovereignty are
indivisible, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
The international community, including the United Nations and
the majority of countries in the world, recognizes that Taiwan
belongs to China, that the government of the People's Republic of
China is the sole legal government representing the whole of China,
and that Taiwan is part of China, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Though the two sides across the Straits are yet to be reunified,
the status of Taiwan as part of the Chinese territory has not
changed and brooks no change, he said.
</P>
<P>
The fact that China has sovereignty over Taiwan has not changed
and will remain unchanged. The Taiwan issue will not possibly be
procrastinated indefinitely and China's reunification is bound to
be realized, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
No matter how many separatist remarks Lee Teng-hui makes, he
can not reverse the historical trend, the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
"We hereby warn Lee Teng-hui and the Taiwan authorities not to
underestimate the firm resolve of the Chinese Government to
safeguard state sovereignty, dignity and territorial integrity or
the courage and strength of the Chinese people to fight against
separation and Taiwan's independence," Zhu stressed.
</P>
<P>
The reunification of China represents the general trend and the
popular will. Lee Teng-hui and the Taiwan authorities should size
up the situation soberly, rein in at the brink of the precipice
and immediately cease all separatist activities, Zhu said.

<P>
This flagrant declaration by Lee Teng-hui marks an extremely
dangerous step he has taken on the separatist road and is an out-
and-out negation of and serious provocation against the
universally-recognized one-China principle, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
It has further exposed his political nature of deliberately
dividing the Chinese territory and sovereignty in an attempt to
separate Taiwan from China, Zhu noted, adding that this has once
again proved that he has cheated Taiwan compatriots and fooled the
world opinion by saying that he "will not and has no need to
pursue a policy for 'Taiwan's independence'" and that "he has not
given up the pursuit for future reunification of the country",
statements that he had made repeatedly in the past.
</P>
<P>
Since he came into office, Lee Teng-hui has, in disregard of
opposition from the majority of the people on the island, spared
no efforts to pursue "pragmatic diplomacy" and gone all out for
separatist activities through such despicable means as bribery,
the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Lee has attempted to create "two Chinas" or "one China, one
Taiwan" in the world and has gone so far as to define the cross-
Straits relations as "state-to-state relations" in defiance of the
will of the people, Zhu pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Lee has gone too far on the dangerous road of playing with
fire, the spokesman said, adding that this will undoubtedly
seriously obstruct the improvement of ties between the two sides
across the Taiwan Straits, affect the stability of the situation
in the Taiwan Straits and jeopardize the peaceful reunification of
China.

<TEXT>
<P>
ALGIERS, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The rapid progress in
democratization in Africa should give people tremendous confidence
for a bright future, said Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo,
who was sworn in as a democratically- elected head of state of the
most populous African country in May this year.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the first day of the three-day 35th summit of the
Organization of African Unity (OAU) here Monday, Obasanjo said
that without stable political condition and good governance,
poverty alleviation and economic development will remain a dream.
</P>
<P>
He said that as 19 sub-Saharan countries are engaged in armed
conflicts today, if the 1980s was Africa's lost decade
economically, the 1990s has turned out to be the decade when
conflicts have reached an ominous proportion.
</P>
<P>
There is a growing tendency for neighboring countries to
intervene bilaterally in their neighbors' internal conflict,
Obasanjo said.
</P>
<P>
Unless the whole conflict situation is arrested and the
countries concerned are assisted to exit from the trend, Africa's
reputation as a continent at war against itself will persist
during the early years of the next millennium, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Conflicts result in considerable human, social, economic and
environmental destruction and create huge structural imbalances,
the Nigerian president said, adding that poverty and conflicts
feed on each other while both go hand-in-hand with bad governance.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 12 (Xinhua) -- French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin
opened on Monday a new line of RER, the Parisian suburb railway
trains which link central Paris with its outskirts.
</P>
<P>
The new line, called Eole and the fifth of its kind in Paris,
was completed after costing 8 billion francs (about 1.3 billion U.
S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Eole links central Paris's Saint-Lazare railway station with
the eastern suburb of the city, the Marne River region.
</P>
<P>
Jospin said at the opening ceremony that the government does
not plan to build any more RER, because of its tremendous
construction work of kilometers of tunnels through central Paris.
</P>
<P>
He said that he prefers to build surface tramways and high
rails in the city's future public transport projects.
</P>
<P>
To build the Eole, constructors had to destroy some historical
architectures along the Seine River to make way for underground
tunnels and railway stations.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia, Singapore to Focus on Long-Term Bilateral Ties: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia and Singapore will
place priority on bilateral relationship for the long term and
will not allow temporary hiccups to jeopardize their long-standing
ties, said Malaysian Foreign Minister Syed Hamid Albar at a press
conference here Monday.
</P>
<P>
"We will build on common factors rather than look at
differences. We want to build on the positives than be reactionary
to short-term problems that may occur from time to time," he told
newsmen.
</P>
<P>
Syed Hamid arrived here Monday morning for a two-day official
visit, his first since becoming foreign minister. He called on
Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong and also met with his
counterpart S. Jayakumar.
</P>
<P>
Syed Hamid said the two countries would continue to work to
resolve a package of outstanding bilateral issues but would not
set a time frame.
</P>
<P>
"We will find an agreement but we are still a long way from
one. The cornerstone of the package is the water issue and once
this is resolved, everything else would fall into place," he said.
</P>
<P>
Singapore is seeking a new water agreement with Malaysia after
the expiry of existing contracts in 2011 and 2061.
</P>
<P>
The other issues in the package are:
</P>
<P>
-- the location of Malaysian customs, immigration and
quarantine facilities at the Tanjong Pagar train station in
Singapore;
</P>
<P>
-- the use of Malaysian airspace by the republic's air force;
and
</P>
<P>
-- the pension savings of peninsular Malaysians working in
Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Syed Hamid said, "We will not solve each individually or
separately. So there will only be an agreement if we can agree to
all the contents of the package." Both sides knew that it would
not be an easy task, he added.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian and Singapore officials have met three times on the
package so far and are expected to meet again in August.
</P>
<P>
Syed Hamid said his meetings with Goh and Jayakumar were warm
but they did not discuss the controversy over the frozen Malaysian
shares formerly traded over Singapore's Central-Limit-Order-Book
(CLOB) exchange as it was a private sector affair.

ADDIS ABABA, July 12 (Xinhua) -- the Organization of African

failed this weekend because of Eritrean absence, a spokeswoman for

Djibouti President Ismael Omar Guelleh and OAU Secretary-General

<HEADLINE> Clashes Erupt Again Between Students and Police in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Clashes erupted again between
Iranian university students and anti-riot police Monday noon in
the wake of protests against the recent police crackdown on
students.
</P>
<P>
Around the Vali-Asr Square in downtown Tehran, a group of
demonstrating university students threw stones and sticks at
policemen who were trying to disperse them from the demonstration.
</P>
<P>
Several angry demonstrators dragged down two plainclothes
policemen from a motorcycle and set fire to the vehicle while
others chased the policemen into lanes.
</P>
<P>
Over 1,000 students shouted slogans condemning the police for
its unauthorized crackdown Thursday night on students who staged
a rally that night protesting the newly-approved press law and the
closure of the leading moderate daily Salam (Hello).
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Republic News Agency reported that the situation
around the square has calmed down after the police, supported by
helicopters, used tear gas to disperse the students.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, over 1,000 students gathered in front of the main
gate of Tehran University in defiance of the ban by the Supreme
National Security Council (SNSC) on any illegal rallies.
</P>
<P>
"Police, Shame Shame; Students, Revenge Revenge" the students
shouted at the anti-riot policemen deployed in the street in front
of the university.
</P>
<P>
In order to avoid further clashes between students and
policemen, some student leaders closed the university gate to
prevent more students from going out of the university.
</P>
<P>
Inside the university at the heart of the city, members of the
Tehran University presiding board, deans of its different colleges
and professors started a sit-in at the university mosque as of
10:00 local times (0530 GMT) Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of students joined their professors, chanting slogans
in condemnation of Thursday's police assault.
</P>
<P>
The students, many of them wearing black bands on their arms as
a mourning for the dead, insisted that at least seven students
were killed in the attack.
</P>
<P>
The SNSC announced on Sunday no student, but a military
officer on holidays, was killed in the crackdown, and all the 200
arrested students have been released.
</P>
<P>
"We do not believe the SNSC statement," an economic student
told Xinhua at the university.
</P>
<P>
The student also rejected the SNSC explanation that the attack
on students was ordered by sub-commanders of the Tehran police
without permission from their superior officers.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Customs Revenues Doubled In Jan.-June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The crackdown on smuggling and tax
evasions and import increases helped China's customs revenues in
the first half.
</P>
<P>
Chinese customs revenues amounted to 78.36 billion yuan (about
9.44 billion U.S. dollars) for the period and accounted for 93.4
percent of this year's target.
</P>
<P>
Of that amount, 1.79 billion yuan went to tax refunds, and 76.
57 billion yuan went to state coffers, up 117 percent from the
corresponding period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The General Administration of Customs set up a special task
force to combat the growing threat from smuggling and local
customs offices have been equipped with electronic scales to help
improve controls of imports and exports.
</P>
<P>
Imports in the first half were worth 75 billion U.S. dollars,
up 17 percent from the same period of 1998. Imports of general
trade goods, a major source of customs revenues, grew more than 80
percent, while imports in the processing trade were down.
</P>
<P>
The import of electric machinery, which usually pay higher
import duties, amounted to nearly a third of the total taxed goods.
</P>
<P>
Customs offices have stepped up efforts to collect taxes and
crack down on tax evasions, a move that added 8 billion yuan to
revenues. They also increased cooperation with local governments
and other government sectors in looking for tax in arrears,
foreign exchange, and value-added goods taxes.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Wages Panel Proposes Meagre Salary for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The National Salary Income and Wages
 Commission has proposed a meager pay structure for political
office holders, by which President Olusegun Obasanjo could earn
282,000 naira (some 3,000 U.S. dollars) yearly.
</P>
<P>
The wage level, proposed by the commission, translates to
23,500 naira monthly - about one-third of an estimated 70,000
naira the president is believed to be currently earning, the
Guardian newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to the proposal submitted to the Senate for approval
last week, senators are to earn 146,000 naira (1,553 dollars)
yearly. The figure is 35,000 naira short of their current yearly
earning or 15,000 less monthly.
</P>
<P>
For legislators in the House of Representatives, the commission
proposed a yearly salary of 117,000 naira.
</P>
<P>
The News Agency of Nigeria reported Sunday that the
commission's proposal which was rejected by the Senate on the
ground that it was not properly addressed to it, also pegged the
salary of special advisers at 161, 000 naira yearly.
</P>
<P>
The Senate rejected the recommendation because, according to
it, the commission is not the appropriate organ vested with the
constitutional powers to recommend salaries of government
functionaries.
</P>
<P>
According to Section 84 of the 1999 Constitution, the Revenue
Mobilization and Fiscal Commission is the appropriate body vested
with such powers.
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted Senator Mojisoluwa Akinfenwa as saying at the
weekend that the Senate also decided to return the commission's
recommendation to the presidency because "we felt a thing like
this should be considered in all its ramification, and not only
the salaries of legislators."
</P>
<P>
In his view, the salary recommended for legislators was grossly
 inadequate. "I sacrifice the whole of my time, some time not
sleeping until 4:00 a.m., and I am given 15,000 naira a month," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The estimate of the current presidential wage is, however,
deduced from the pronouncement by Second Republic President,
Alhaji Shehu Shagari in defense of former leader's allowances
announced in a recent Federal Government Gazette.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Philippines Creates Task Force for Railroad Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government Monday
created a special task force to oversee the implementation of a
railroad project in Mindanao, southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Under an administrative order, Philippine President Joseph
Estrada announced creation of the Mindanao Rail System (MRS) Task
Force to undertake preparatory studies for the project
implementation.
</P>
<P>
The task group will also act as the clearing house for policy
and operational issues affecting the project implementation.
</P>
<P>
The move is seen here as an effort to help transform Mindanao
into the nation's premier food provider and new economic hub in
the region.
</P>
<P>
President Estrada has also vowed to make up for decades of
government neglect of Mindanao by putting priority on development
projects in the area.
</P>
<P>
Robert Aventajado, chairman of the Presidential Committee on
Flagship Programs and Projects, was designated as chairman of the
task force.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Finance Secretary Edgardo Espilitu said the rail
transit system in Mindanao was among the projects that the
Philippines has lined up for foreign funding.
</P>
<P>
During his working visit to Tokyo in June, Estrada said
Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi assured him of support for
the Mindanao rail project.

<HEADLINE> Y2K Puts Off Christmas Holidays for Students </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The Y2K computer bug is to put off
Christmas holidays for two days for many of Canada's school
children, local reports said.
</P>
<P>
More than one million students in Ontario will be affected by
the shuffled holiday calendar, which will start and end two days
later than usual, with the last day of school on December 23 and
the return date set for January 8.
</P>
<P>
The same Y2K Calendar rescheduling will happen in Nova Scotia
and New Brunswick as well, while in Alberta, most school boards
are not changing their holiday plans.
</P>
<P>
School boards plan to use the extra two days in January to make
sure Y2K fixes have taken hold, said the reports.
</P>
<P>
In Peel Region, west of Toronto, school board spokeswoman
Sylvia was quoted as saying that schools in her district have
prepared for the Y2K computer bug, but changed the holiday just in
case.
</P>
<P>
"It's a preventative measure to make sure that when students
come back to school, there is time to sort out things that might
be unanticipated," she told reporters.

<HEADLINE> African Strength Comes from Coop, Integration: OAU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALGIERS, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Secretary-General of the
Organization of African Unity (OAU) Salim Ahmed Salim said here
Monday that Africa's strength lies in economic cooperation and
integration.
</P>
<P>
Given the challenges of globalization and international
competition, " Africa's strength both internally and in its
relations with the rest of the world, lies in pursuing vigorously
the goal of economic cooperation and integration," said Salim when
addressing the opening of the 35th OAU summit.
</P>
<P>
The challenge of putting out declared commitment into practical
action must be taken seriously if Africa is to enter the new
millennium better equipped, said the OAU chief.
</P>
<P>
However, he confessed that the march towards the establishment
of the African Economic Community has been unacceptably slow.
</P>
<P>
African countries which feature small-scale economies need to
cooperate to face daunting challenges lying ahead, Salim noted.
</P>
<P>
The fast globalization process has notably marginalized the
poor continent and the dwindling commodity prices in the world
market further impoverished the Africans. And the African
countries have to strengthen their competitiveness through
cooperation and integration.
</P>
<P>
The three-day summit, the last for the 20th Century, is to map
out strategies for the future development of the underdeveloped
continent.
</P>
<P>
A total of 46 heads of states and government from African
countries and many dignitaries including U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan attended the opening session.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestine leader
Yasser Arafat held their first face-to-face meeting today and
pledged to begin working together promptly toward a peace
agreement that will reshape relations between Israelis and
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. Republican and Democratic party officials looking ahead
to a presidential race between Texas Governor George W.Bush and
Vice President Gore, the two current front-runners for their party
nominations, foresee Bush launching an advertising blitz next
spring that Gore will be unable to match because of a serious fund-
raising disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- India and Pakistan said Sunday that rival forces battling
for the last two months over the icy ridges and mountaintops of
Kashmir would begin a phased withdrawal, heralding an end to the
latest confrontation between the world's newest nuclear powers.
</P>
<P>
-- Just two years after it began, the financial crisis that
started in Asia and spread pain around the world appears to be
over--leaving many to wonder if the symptoms have abated before
the disease could be treated.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal
</P>
<P>
-- General Motors was ordered to pay 4.9 billion dollars to six
people who were burned when their Chevrolet exploded after its
fuel tank ruptured in a rear-end crash. The jury award, one of the
largest in a product-liability case, demonstrated the impact of
certain GM internal documents that have been the focus of battles
between the auto maker and plaintiffs' attorneys.
</P>
<P>
-- Baxter International will spin off its cardiovascular
business, which makes the world's largest-selling tissue heart
valves and is set to generate sales of nearly one billion dollars
this year.

<HEADLINE> African Leaders Urged to Contribute to Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALGIERS, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Secretary-General of the
Organization of African Unity (OAU) has urged African leaders to
contribute more to peace in the continent.
</P>
<P>
Salim made the appeal when addressing the opening of the 35th
OAU Summit of Heads of State and Government here Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
He said both the peace agreement for the Democratic Republic of
Congo signed in Zambian capital Lusaka two days ago and the one
for Sierra Leone signed in Togolese capital Lome on July 7 show
that where there is determination and persistence, there is a
solution to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
The OAU chief praised Zambian President Frederick Chiluba for
his painstaking efforts made towards bringing peace to the third
largest African country.
</P>
<P>
"These achievements have been possible through concerted and
collective efforts," Salim said. "They should encourage us to
work even harder in order to address the other hotbeds of tension
which are still prevailing on the continent."
</P>
<P>
"We need to especially intensify our efforts at ending the
tragic conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Africa cannot afford to remain one of perpetual insecurity and
instability. Leaders should recommit themselves to doing
everything possible to free the continent from the vicious circle
of poverty, diseases, conflicts and violence, the OAU chief added.

<HEADLINE> AIDS Shortens Tanzanians' Life Expectancy to 49.7 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 12 (Xinhua) - The average life expectancy
of Tanzanians has declined to 49.7 years from 51 years two years
ago and 56 years at the beginning of this decade, largely due to
the spread of AIDS epidemic.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Development Program (UNDP) Human Development
Report 1999 revealed this Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Because of AIDS, the average expectancy is lowering ... The
situation is getting worse," UNDP representative in Tanzania,
Sally Fegan-Wyles, said while launching the report in Tanzanian
capital Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
She said one in every 10 Tanzanian adults is believed to have
been infected with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.
</P>
<P>
The UNDP representative said the media has done a lot in
publicizing the risk of AIDS, but other sectors should also get
involved in the campaign against the deadly disease.
</P>
<P>
According to the UNDP report distributed at the press
conference, Tanzania's human development index (HDI) continues to
show a progressive decline: Its ranking in 1999 has dropped to
the 156th among the 174 countries, compared to the 126th in 1992
(the highest ranking ever achieved) and 127th in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The index primarily takes three factors into account: life
expectancy, access to education and income, she said.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the human development index for Tanzania
has shown some improvement during the same period, from 0.266 in
1991 to 0.421 in 1999.
</P>
<P>
However, the UNDP representative pointed out that while
Tanzania is developing at a slower pace, its gap with other
countries is growing wider.
</P>
<P>
"It suggests that qualitative improvements to human life in
Tanzania are indeed taking place, albeit at a very slow pace. In
fact, when compared to other countries, the decline in ranking
provides a good indicator that Tanzania is not progressing at the
same pace as the rest of the world," the report said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the report said Tanzania's population with access to
safe water has dropped one percentage point from an average of 39
percent during the late 1980s to 38 percent at present.
</P>
<P>
Fegan-Wyles said she could not explain the reason for the one
percentage of decline, as the figure is "very small to comment."
</P>
<P>
The gross school enrollment ratio for all levels (age six to
23) has dropped from 44 percent in 1980 to 34 percent in 1995 and
33 percent in 1997, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Another UNDP official said that the income for Tanzanians has
increased by 15 percent from 1998 to 1999, but she could not
provide the specific incomes.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian Finance Minister Daniel Yona said in June that
Tanzanians' per capita income reached 210 U.S. dollars in the
1998/99 fiscal year that ends last month.

<HEADLINE> Angola Begins to Reap from Granite Export </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Angolstone, a newly-established
company in southern Huila Province, has reaped some 650,000 U.S.
dollars within one year from its export of the black granite.
</P>
<P>
According to public relations manager of the company, Carlos
Alberto, by June this year, 2,200 cubic meters of this special
black granite have been produced.
</P>
<P>
He noted that currently, the company has an output capacity of
producing 4,800 cubic meters a year.
</P>
<P>
The manager stressed that the decoration stone sells very well,
 especially in Europe and southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
The local company established last August opened its first
quarry at Tchiquatiti Village some 90 km east of the provincial
capital city of Lubango by using the loans provided by the Angolan
government.
</P>
<P>
Angolstone primarily invested 2.5 million dollars to buy
machinery, transport vehicles and to employ technicians and
workers, said Alberto.
</P>
<P>
He added that his company is planning to raise 1.5 million
dollars to double its production capacity in addition to its
500,000-dollar supplementary investment.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan government is stepping up to attract foreign
investors to invest in the exploration of its rich mineral
resources.
</P>
<P>
However, the 20-year-long civil war in the southern African
country has daunted many potential foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
Angola is rich in petroleum, natural gas, diamonds, iron,
copper, manganese, gold and mica. But the country are mainly
exporting crude oil and diamonds due to its limited mineral
exploration capacity.

<HEADLINE> China Improving Spring Cropping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 12 (Xinhua) -- China's State Statistics Bureau
said today that the planting acreage for spring rice crops this
year was 7.651 million ha., 162,000 ha. less than that of last
year.
</P>
<P>
The sowing acreage for spring wheat was 3.33 million ha., a
decrease of 352,000 ha. from last year and a record low. Spring
cotton took up 542,000 ha. less than for last spring, at 3.466
million ha.
</P>
<P>
Premier Zhu Rongji has said that the purchasing prices for
grain and cotton will be determined by their quality. The
government will not guarantee to buy all early season rice next
year because of its poor taste, and poor quality cotton is
expected to see a continuous drop in price this year.
</P>
<P>
China has had increasing stockpiles of grain and cotton in the
past few years while importing large amount of grain because it
lacks quality and marketable grain.
</P>
<P>
This spring, eight out of nine major rice growing regions
reduced the planting acreage and eight out of nine major cotton
growing areas reduced planting acreage for spring crops. China
reduced also the amount of land used for tobacco, sugar, and jute
during the spring season, and increased the amount in corn,
sorghum, millet and beans.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Sydney Olympics received a late
surge in ticket sales, but the result was still far from the
target for the initial offer.
</P>
<P>
More than 100,000 ticket applications have been received with
four days remaining in the opening offer, Games organizers SOCOG
said.
</P>
<P>
With 1,000 Australian dollars (660 U.S. dollars) cost for each
application, SOCOG made 100 million Australian dollars (66 million
U.S. dollars) out of the sales until Monday, well below the
initial target of 240 million Australian dollars (158 million U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
But ticketing spokesman John O'Neill said the gap between
actual sales and the target was acceptable to SOCOG.

The 46-year-old new prime minister's coalition government is

The new prime minister will first face the challenge of solving

</P>
<P>
The crisis is a major reason which triggered the resignation of
former prime minister Jean-Luc Dehaene last month.

Verhofstadt will also need to rebuild his country's

<HEADLINE> Singapore &AMP; Malaysia Reaffirm Commitment to Maintaining Good Bilateral Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Singapore and Malaysia have
reaffirmed their commitment to maintaining good bilateral
relations and solving outstanding bilateral issues with an overall
package.
</P>
<P>
A Spokesman from Singapore Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MAF)
made the point Monday in his comments on the meeting between
Singapore Foreign Minister S. Jayakumar and his Malaysian
counterpart Datuk Seri Syed Hamid who arrived here earlier today
on a two-day official visit at the invitation of Jayakumar.
</P>
<P>
Responding in a written form to press queries, the spokesman
said "the foreign ministers reaffirmed the importance of
maintaining good bilateral relations and noted that both countries
should remain focused on the long-term relationship and benefits
of mutual cooperation."
</P>
<P>
"They agreed that it was important that the two foreign
ministers should continue to maintain channels of communication so
as to manage and resolve any bilateral difficulties that occur
from time to time," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Touching on the negotiations on the package to solve the
outstanding issues between the two neighbors, the spokesman said
"both foreign ministers noted that another senior officials'
meeting is due to be held in August and they agreed that both
sides should try to narrow the gaps so as to arrive at a 'win-win'
package deal".
</P>
<P>
Jayakumar also briefed Datuk Seri Syed Hamid on Singapore's
preparation for the upcoming ASEAN Ministerial Meeting, ASEAN
Regional Forum and Post Ministerial Conference to be held here
from July 19-28, 1999, the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
Datuk Seri Syed Hamid today also called on Singapore Prime
Minister Goh Chok Tong but no detailed information is available
about their meeting.
</P>
<P>
Datuk Seri Syed Hamid took on the foreign affairs post in
January and came to Singapore on an introductory visit.
</P>
<P>
Singapore and Malaysia are bound by a multiplicity of complex
ties and their relations have seen many ups and downs.
</P>
<P>
In recent years the two sides have run into a rough patch with
quite a number of issues including those over relocation of
Malaysian Check-Point of Immigration and Quarantine facilities at
Tanjong Pagar Railway Station, the long-term water supply by
Malaysia to Singapore, the withdrawal of West Malaysian CPF funds,
etc.
</P>
<P>
Both sides have been committed to forging a long-time
relationship of mutual benefit and win-win cooperation. The prime
ministers of the two countries have agreed to solve various
bilateral problems within an overall package and negotiations on
the package started earlier this year.

ROME, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Italian Serie A side Lazio will make
a final offer to Arsenal's striker Nicolas Anelka, leaving 24
hours for the England Premiership club to decide weather to take
it or leave it, Lazio's chief Sergio Cragnotti said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Cragnotti told Italian press that Tuesday is the deadline of
the negotiation for the French international.
</P>
<P>
Lazio is expected to increase its offer from 34 million dollars
to 40 million, which is still far away from Arsenal's 50 million
request.
</P>
<P>
Arsenal chief David Dein and his French coach Arsene Wenger
failed to reach an agreement in the weekend talks.
</P>
<P>
Cragnotti said Lazio was not interested in a cash-plus-players
deal, though it was under big threats of its Serie A rivals
Juventus, who is likely to table a bigger offer.

<HEADLINE> Pak Still Supports Kashmiri Mujahideen: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Foreign Minister
Sartaj Aziz Monday reiterated Pakistan's "unequivocal and
consistent support" to the Kashmiri Mujahideen despite the appeal
to them to pull out of Kargil.
</P>
<P>
Aziz made this remark while meeting Kashmiri leaders at the
Foreign Office here.
</P>
<P>
According to an official press release, the foreign minister
paid a tribute to the Mujahideen and the Kashmiri people for their
"steadfast resistance against repression and injustice" and "the
sacrifices they have made for the just Kashmir cause".
</P>
<P>
Aziz said as the result of their effective struggling, the
international community has been convinced that an expeditious
settlement of the Kashmir issue is essential for peace and
security in South Asia.
</P>
<P>
"Kargil will be always remembered as a glorious chapter" in the
history of the Kashmir cause, said Aziz.
</P>
<P>
The Mujahideen who have been combating the Indian troops in
Kargil for the last two months have responded "positively" to the
appeal of the Pakistani government and begun "disengagement" from
the area, Aziz disclosed on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
A couple of days ago, Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif
called on the Mujahideen to vacate their positions in India-held
Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
The Kashmiri leaders expressed their appreciation of the
"consistent moral, political and diplomatic support to their
cause" by the government and people of Pakistan, according to the
press release.

capital city of Algeria looks like a paradise in the summer sun.
</P>
<P>
As incumbent Chairman of the Organization of African Unity
(OAU) and President of Burkina Faso, Blaise Compaore, announced
the opening of the 35th summit here Monday, African leaders have
started their journey to decide the future of the continent,
somewhat dubious in many eyes.
</P>
<P>
Algeria, as a hospitable host, opens its arms to welcome the
leaders flown in from every corner of the continent. In the
Sheraton Hotel where the heads of state and government were
received, there was traditional music played by Arab young artists
and unique dances performed by local artistic troupes.
</P>
<P>
The newly-completed five-star hotel, especially designed for
this momentous function, faces the Mediterranean waves, looks like
a big bird in its wings.
</P>
<P>
Forty-six African leaders, together with 2,400 delegates from
other places, have come with bags of problems and hopes that they
can go back home with some solutions.
</P>
<P>
They have gathered here to meet the daunting challenges lying
ahead and to shape the future for the continent.
</P>
<P>
The summit, the last of the 36-year-old organization in the
20th Century, is held at a historical juncture and will focus its
attention on economic integration and political stability, two key
issues concerning the survival of the OAU and the prosperity of
this least developed continent in the coming millennium.
</P>
<P>
In this century, many African countries won their independence
and achieved economic recovery. The living standards for most
Africans have been enhanced with an increasingly stable society.
</P>
<P>
However, the social development and economic recovery in many
parts of the continent are hindered by some major problems mainly
inherited from the colonial age and worsened by the
marginalization in the globalization process.
</P>
<P>
One third of sub-Sahara countries are involved in civil unrest,
bilateral conflicts and regional wars. More than half of Africans
are still living under the poverty line.
</P>
<P>
Some 6.5 million refugees, about 70 percent of the world's
total, are roaming about in the continent and AIDS is spreading
unchecked.
</P>
<P>
This summit features African leaders' unprecedented resolve and
 determination to face the challenges and map out a blueprint of
their own for the continent in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
The three-day summit will exert its implications in Africa and
beyond and will be of great importance to every African.
</P>
<P>
The African leaders can feel the weight of burdens on their
shoulders more than ever before because they will surely be
drowned if they do not swim.

<HEADLINE> Bangkok to Hold Asia-Pacific Film Festival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The 44th Asia-Pacific Film
Festival will be held in Bangkok from November 22 to 26 to promote
cooperation within the region, the organizer of the festival
announced at a press conference Monday.
</P>
<P>
About 50 films from 14 members of the Federation of Motion
Picture Producers in Asia will be shown in the festival, including
some films honoring Thai King Bhumibol Adulyadej on the occasion
of his 72nd birthday on December 5.
</P>
<P>
The festival will also stage a seminar for members to exchange
views under the topic of "Cinemasia 2000" to strengthen
cooperation and create global market appeal for Asia-Pacific films
in the next century.
</P>
<P>
Tian Ponvanit, chief advisor to the Federation of National Film
Associations of Thailand, told Xinhua that the festival is to be
held to resist the infiltration of Western films in the region.
</P>
<P>
"Film is not only a commodity but also the epitome of a
country's society, history and culture, so a country cannot do
without films," Tian noted.
</P>
<P>
Thailand produced 12 films last year, but none of them made
money, he said.
</P>
<P>
During the golden age in the 1960s and 1970s, Thailand produced
more than 200 films at most every year, he added.

official visit aimed at promoting foreign and economic relations
between the two countries.

century," he added.

considered the matter as the internal affairs of Cambodia, and

<HEADLINE> Islamic Bank to Provide $20M in Aid to Mozambique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The Islamic Development Bank has
decided to provide 20 million U.S. dollars in aid to Mozambique
from the year 2000 to 2003, the Noticias newspaper reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to a memorandum of understanding reached recently
between the bank and the Mozambican government, many sectors in
the southern African country will benefit from the assistance
program.
</P>
<P>
Among the sectors are education, health, training, agriculture,
 fisheries, housing, energy, transport and other infrastructures,
said the paper.
</P>
<P>
Mozambican Deputy Minister of Planning and Finance Carlos
Jessen said that the assistance program will give priority to
those entrepreneurs who usually have little access to credits.
</P>
<P>
And the program will also help to streamline the bureaucracy of
the highly-indebted poor country, he added.
</P>
<P>
Jessen noted that his government will strengthen its
cooperation with the Islamic Development Bank, speaking highly of
the assistance provided by the bank to Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
Vice Governor oft he bank, Ousmane Sheck, also said the
memorandum indicated that the two sides have reached consensus on
the investment and their willingness to strengthen cooperation
between them.
</P>

Monday his satisfaction with the technical and organizational
aspects of the event and the bright future awaiting the world
university sports movement.

and friendship among university students around the world," said
Nebiolo, president of the International University Sports
Federation (FISU).

magnificent performances from the athletes in all of the 12
disciplines of the Games with excellent results, particularly in
athletics and swimming, "Nebiolo said.

they competed," he said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Meets With Australian Foreign Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 12 (Xinhua) -- President Jiang Zemin, in a
meeting here today with Australia's Foreign Minister Alexander
Downer, said that China is willing to make a joint effort with
Australia to establish bilateral ties in the 21st century with
long-term stability and healthy growth.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that both China and Australia have a great influence
in the Asia-Pacific region and have a common interest in guarding
regional peace and stability and promoting regional prosperity and
development.
</P>
<P>
China has always placed great importance on its friendly
cooperative ties with Australia, he said, and, in recent years,
with a concerted effort from both sides, bilateral ties have made
considerable progress and had sound development momentum.
</P>
<P>
He cited the fact that the leaders of both countries have had
regular exchanges of visits and contacts and bilateral
communication and cooperation in various areas has been smooth,
consultations and dialogue have been reinforced, and economic and
trade links are getting closer, but he said there is still
potential and great prospects for further developing mutually
beneficial cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Downer said that Australia emphasizes its relations with China
and is satisfied with the smooth development of bilateral ties.
The Australians are looking forward to Jiang's state visit later
this year, he said, adding that he believes that it will promote
bilateral cooperation in various fields.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that he too is looking forward to meeting with
Australia's leaders to jointly plan bilateral ties in the next
century, and that although the world has entered an information
age, information technology can never substitute for face-to-face
contact between world leaders and people.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the two countries can increase
direct contacts, deepen mutual understanding and cooperation, and
said that this would certainly push bilateral ties forward and
benefit the prosperity and stability of the Asia-Pacific region.

<HEADLINE> China Welcomes Cease-fire Agreement on DRC Conflicts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 12 (Xinhua) -- China today extended welcome to a
cease-fire agreement signed by relevant parties on the conflicts
in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in Zambian capital city
of Lusaka Saturday evening, according to Foreign Ministry
spokesman Zhu Bangzao.
</P>
<P>
He said that China also appreciates the unremitting efforts
made by relevant parties to push forward a peaceful settlement of
the conflicts.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government is concerned about the related issue,
and it holds that all warring parties should end the conflicts at
an early date through negotiations and consultations on the basis
of respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity of DRC, and
in the spirit of African unity and national reconciliation, the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that the signing of such an agreement is an important
step toward seeking a political settlement of the conflicts, and
also a positive try for African nations to solve African problems
relying on themselves.
</P>
<P>
China hopes that all parties will seriously implement the
agreement, and it is also willing to work with the international
community, the United Nations Security Council in particular, in
continuing to offer support and assistance to the peace process in
DRC, Zhu said.

<HEADLINE> China Happy with Performance and Friendship in Universiade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PALMA, Spain, July 12 (Xinhua) -- China has achieved its aim of
training athletes for the Olympics and enhancing friendship
through competitions in the 20th Universiade, said Chef de Mission
of the Chinese sports delegation here Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
"We are satisfied with the performances of our athletes who
have won nine golds, six silvers and 10 bronzes as of today with
two-day competitions remained in the Universiade," said Gao Jian.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the basketball tournaments, China reaped medals of
different colors in all the other eight sports they competed in
the Games in Palma.
</P>
<P>
"Our main purposes for the Universiade are to train our
athletes for the Olympics, to gain experiences from international
meets and to promote friendships with athletes from other
countries and regions," said the Chef de Mission.
</P>
<P>
And that's why China fielded its second-string athletes in most
of the sports, like gymnastics, diving, the men's and women's
volleyball and basketball, with the exception in judo and fencing
competitions.
</P>
<P>
"Besides, we're very proud of our strict anti-doping measures
being taken in the games, by even educating our coaches and
athletes against some Chinese traditional herb medicines to cure
their illness and injuries to keep away from unnecessary awkward
situations.
</P>
<P>
"Our swimmer Pang Ran was only treated after seeking a green
light from the technical committee for her irregular menstruation,
and she still won the silver medal from the women's 200-meter
butterfly final and a bronze medal from the 100-meter butterfly,"
said Gao Jian.
</P>
<P>
Being aware of the fact that Japan has improved its level in
both the athletics and swimming since the last Asian Games, "we're
still encouraged by the results of our young athletes in the field
events and in the diving," said Liu Guangchun, vice Chef de
Mission of the Chinese delegation.
</P>
<P>
"Our women's volleyball players rallied from two sets down to
win the top honor, and their fighting spirit of competitiveness is
what we cherished most," said Gao Jian.
</P>
<P>
"Anyway, we still have to think deeply in our delegations for
future international meets to reflect the relative level of our
Chinese athletes," said the Chef de Mission.

<HEADLINE> Four Tons of Marijuana Burned in Cambodia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian police burned four
tons of marijuana Monday at Sihanoukville, aimed at displaying the
government's determination to solve the growing drug-trafficking
problem.
</P>
<P>
Cambodian police seized a total of 4,146 kilograms of marijuana
in April at the port of Sihanoukville, which was packed in the
bottom of a shipment of beans bound for the United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
It was said to be the largest haul of marijuana seized by the
police this year.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister Sar Kheng and U.S. Ambassador Kenneth
Quinn chaired the drug-burning ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia is seen by traffickers as an ideal spot for cannabis
production and a transshipment point for other narcotics. The
Royal Government of Cambodia is taking some drastic measures to
crack down on illegal cultivation, production and trafficking of
the drugs.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on the international anti-drug day, Prime Minister Hun
Sen appealed to the authorities concerned and the whole people to
join hands in combating drug trafficking and drug abuse, and urged
farmers to stop cultivating marijuana.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Leader Criticizes Police Attack on Students </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Iran's paramount leader Ayatollah
Ali Khamenei said on Monday that the attack on Tehran University
dormitory complex by the security forces (police) is "unacceptable
in the Islamic Republic of Iran."
</P>
<P>
"It is not acceptable at all to attack the house and shelter of
the students, particularly overnight or at the time of
congregation prayers," Khamenei said at a meeting with a group of
people.
</P>
<P>
The conservative leader underlined that any violator in the
raid will be brought to justice, the Islamic Republic News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Iran's conservative-dominated security forces on Thursday night
forced into the Tehran University dormitory complex, storming
students' hostels and beating up students there. Student
protesters said at least seven students were killed in the attack
and dozens of others injured.
</P>
<P>
However, the Supreme National Security Council (SNSC), headed
by the moderate President Mohammad Khatami, announced on Sunday
that no student, but a military officer on holidays, was killed in
the incident, triggered by a student rally protesting the
newly-approved press law and the ban on the leading moderate daily
Salam (Hello).
</P>
<P>
SNSC also said the 200 students arrested by the security forces
have been released.
</P>
<P>
Students across Iran on Monday continued their protests for the
fifth consecutive day, demanding immediate identification and
punishment of those who provoked the unauthorized attack.

<HEADLINE> UNDP Ranks Nigeria Low in Human Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria is ranked the 146th least
developed out of 174 countries in terms of Human Development Index
(HDI) by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) in its 1999
report.
</P>
<P>
The report distributed here on Monday also classifies Nigeria
along with the 34 other countries into the low human development
cadre in terms of life-expectancy, educational attainment and
adjusted real income.
</P>
<P>
The report divides the countries in the world into three
groups, 45 in high human development group, 94 in medium human
development group and 35 in low human development group.
</P>
<P>
Most of the low human development group are African countries
with the lowest performers being Sierra Leone, Niger, Ethiopia,
Burkina Faso, Burundi, Mozambique, Guinea Bissau, Eritrea and
Mali.
</P>
<P>
The report notes that the fifth of the world's people living in
the highest income countries has 86 percent of world gross
domestic product (GDP), 82 percent of world export markets and 74
percent of world telephone lines while the bottom fifth in the
poorest countries has about one percent in each sector.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the income gap between the richest
fifth of the world's people and the poorest fifth increased from
30 to 1 in 1960 to 74 to 1 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
During 1980-1996, the U.N. report notes, only 33 countries
achieved 3 percent annual growth in gross national product (GNP)
per capita while 59 countries, mainly in Sub-Saharan Africa and
the countries of the former Eastern Block, GNP per capita
declined.
</P>
<P>
The human development report decries the breakneck speed of
globalization, which is making life more treacherous and less
secure.
</P>
<P>
The benefit and opportunities of globalization have not been
shared equitably, it says, adding that the result is "grotesque"
and dangerous polarization between people and countries benefiting
from the system and those that are merely passive recipients of
its effects.
</P>
<P>
It states that care is threatened because today's competitive
global market is putting pressures on the time, resources and
incentives for caring labor.
</P>
<P>
The breakthroughs in technology such as the INTERNET, can open
a fast track to knowledge based in rich and poor countries alike.
</P>
<P>
But, the report says "at present this benefits the relatively
well-off and educated, 88 percent of users live in industrialized
countries, which collectively represented just 17 percent of the
world population."

<HEADLINE> Uganda Intensifies Fight Against AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Uganda has taken a series of
measures in a bid to reduce the AIDS infection, Ugandan Health
Minister Chrispus Kiyonga said.
</P>
<P>
Local media Monday quoted the minister as saying that the
national efforts to curb the HIV/AIDS pandemic include the
establishment of a national AIDS commission and regional blood
transfusion services across the country.
</P>
<P>
Uganda is one of the countries seriously affected by AIDS. Over
120,000 people are now living with the disease and 1.4 million
with HIV. More than 500,000 have reportedly died of AIDS in the
east African country since early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Collective efforts, openness and political support are also
contributing to Uganda's anti-AIDS campaign, Kiyonga told an AIDS
awareness seminar.
</P>
<P>
Peter Piot, Executive Director of the recently formed joint
United Nations Program on AIDS, was quoted as saying that Uganda's
strategy of openness and concern through organizations has now
been recommended for other African countries.
</P>
<P>
The director said the Uganda's experience in the fight against
AIDS disease has been hailed as positive example for other African
states by delegates preparing for the 35th Summit of the
Organization of African Unity (OAU).

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh made remarkable
progresses in human development field in term of human development
index (HDI), according the 10th Annual Human Development Report
1999 released here on Monday by the United Nations Development
Program (UNDP) Dhaka Office.
</P>
<P>
The UNDP's HDI ranks 174 countries in terms of life expectancy,
education and income, and among the countries listed in the
report, Bangladesh is the 150th.
</P>
<P>
The HDI of this South Asian country was increased to 0.440 in
1997 from 0.318 in 1975, while its GDP (gross domestic product)
per capita was raised to 218 U.S. dollars in 1997 from 134 dollars
in 1975.
</P>
<P>
The life expectancy at birth in Bangladesh went up to 58.1 in
1997 (from 56 in 1992), and the adult literacy rate raised to 38.9
percent in 1997 (from 37.2 percent in 1995).
</P>
<P>
However, the latest official statistics show that the life
expectancy at birth of the country now stands at 59.6 years, adult
literacy has already raised to 56 percent at the present, while
the GDP per capita stood at 280 dollars in the 1997-98 fiscal
year.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh still remains among the least developed countries in
the world, though it has made remarkable progresses in human
development field. Now it stands at the low level in terms of the
human development in various fields.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Investment Climate to Improve in Three Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Investment climate in Indonesia,
one of the Southeast Asian economies which has been hard hit by
the economic crisis since mid 1997, will improve in two or three
years, a senior official told reporters in Padang, capital of West
Sumatera, Monday.
</P>
<P>
After attending an investment coordinating meeting in Padang,
Assistant to the Minister for Investment Policy and Climate of
Investment Soenaryo Danusaputro said the improvement still depends
on the success of this nation in dealing with political and
security problems.
</P>
<P>
"We expect the investment recovery to take place in two or
three years because the most decisive factors are the political
and security problems," he was quoted by Antara News Agency as
saying.
</P>
<P>
If the remaining political and security problems have been
solvable, the investment climate in this country will offer great
potential and be easy to develop, he said.
</P>
<P>
Danusaputro said the opportunity to improve the investment
climate is very likely, because installed production assets in
Indonesia are very big.
</P>
<P>
The improvement of macro variables, which affects the
production sector (of goods and services), such as the decrease in
the interest rate and the rupiah exchange rate against the U.S.
dollar, makes the investment climate become competitive again,
especially if the funds for investment are available, he added.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark interest rate of Bank Indonesia one-month
promissory notes has dropped to 17.15 percent last week compared
to 35 percent earlier this year. The rupiah recently managed to
strengthen to around 6,700 rupiah per U.S. dollar, compared to
more than 14,000 rupiah last year.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Ready for Mayon's Eruption: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Defense Secretary
Orlando Mercado on Sunday said government is ready to secure
safety of villagers near Mt. Mayon in case of eruption of the
unpredictable active volcano, Philippine News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The latest bulletin released by Philippine Institute of
Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs) said their monitoring
stations have registered a higher sulfur dioxide emission from the
volcano's crater, with some 6,000 tons per day compared to earlier
highest of only about 2,800 tons per day.
</P>
<P>
There were also reports of drying up of wells in villages
around the volcano's slope, one of the natural signs of possible
ground inflation and rise in temperature.
</P>
<P>
Several volcanic tremors were also registered on Sunday,
according to the Phivolcs experts.
</P>
<P>
Secretary Mercado said he has met with local government
officials and heads of local disaster councils to enhance
preparations on the possible eruption of Mayon.
</P>
<P>
Mercado also brought with him some relief goods for evacuees
coming from within the six and seven-kilometer danger zones of Mt.
Mayon.
</P>
<P>
Mayon coughed up a huge column of ash laden smoke June 22 which
caught everyone by surprise, devoid of any physical signs before
the blast.
</P>
<P>
They raised the alert level of Mt. Mayon from one to two a week
after the blast, but its condition took on an erratic tempo.

<HEADLINE> South Asia Has Lowest Number of Internet Users: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Only 0.04 percent of the
population in the South Asian region are Internet users, the
lowest in the world, a United Nations report released here Monday
said.
</P>
<P>
South Asia accounts for 23.5 percent of the world population
but only 0.04 of them are Internet users, well below the world
average of 2.4 percent, said the Human Development Report 1999
commissioned by the U.N. Development Program.
</P>
<P>
In the sub-Saharan African region, 0.1 percent of the
population are Internet users while the Arabian states have 0.2
percent users, followed by Eastern Europe, the Commonwealth of
Independent States and East Asia with 0.4 percent, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
It noted that the Southeast Asia and the Pacific have 0.5
percent Internet users, the Latin American and the Caribbean
region have 0.8 percent users while the percentage for the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries
(excluding the United States) is 6.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
The United States, which accounts for a mere 4.7 percent of the
world population, has more computers than the rest of the world
combined. Of its total population, 26.3 percent are Internet
users, the report said.
</P>
<P>
It said that the Internet, the worldwide computer link-up, is
the "fastest growing tool of communication ever," with the number
of users expected to grow from 150 million today to more than 700
million in 2001.
</P>
<P>
The number of Internet hosts -- computers with a direct
connection to the Internet -- rose from under 100,000 in 1988 to
over 36 million in 1998, it said.
</P>
<P>
"Information and communications technology are tremendous tools

<HEADLINE> ARATS Official Stresses "One China" Policy (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Leaders in Taiwan and of the
Taiwan-based Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) were urged here
Monday to stop sabotaging the cross-straits relations and contacts
between the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (
ARATS) and the SEF.
</P>
<P>
Tang Shubei, executive vice-president of the ARATS, told Hong
Kong media that the "one China" principle is essential to the
stability of the across-straits relations and the cooperation
between the ARATS and the SEF, which reached a common
understanding on the "one China" principle in 1992.
</P>
<P>
However, leaders in Taiwan and of the SEF made the fallacious
remarks that the relations between the two sides of the Taiwan
Straits are special "state-to-state" relations, Tang said, noting
that this is a crude sabotage of the cross-straits relations and
the understanding between the ARATS and the SEF.
</P>
<P>
He said some leaders in Taiwan and of the SEF used to hold that
there is only "one China" in the world.
</P>
<P>
Statesmen should keep their words, and their failure to keep
their promise will only cause disaster to the people of Taiwan, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that their fallacious remarks could by no means change
the fact that there is only one China in the world and that Taiwan
is part of China, and that their splittism action will be doomed
to failure.
</P>
<P>
Tang pledged that the ARATS will resolutely support the stance
of the spokesman of the Taiwan Affairs Offices of the Central
Committee of the Communist Party of China and of the State Council
in refuting Lee-Teng-hui's remarks that cross-straits relations
are special "state-to-state" relations, and he hoped the Taiwan
authorities would stop their behavior of "playing with fire."

<P>
He pointed out that it is the consistent stance of the mainland
to solve the Taiwan question by peaceful means, and the mainland
has been working hard for the goal since 1979.
</P>
<P>
The majority of the Taiwan compatriots also expect stable cross-
straits relations, but not the sabotage of the relations, he said,
emphasizing that the stance of the mainland to resolutely
safeguard the state sovereignty and territorial integrity will
never change.
</P>
<P>
When asked about the Taiwan trip by ARARTS President Wang
Daohan, Tang said that both sides had discussed Wang's Taiwan tour
this fall, but not yet set the specific timetable. He expressed
the hope that the SEF would stop sabotaging the basis for the
normal exchanges between the ARATS and the SEF.
</P>
<P>
He said that since 1987, some 14 million Taiwan compatriots
have come to the mainland for such activities as investment,
business, study, travel and visiting relatives, and more than 100,
000 of them often stay in the mainland.
</P>
<P>
The proper rights and interests of the Taiwan compatriots and
their personal safety have been fully protected in the mainland,
he said, adding some cases involving their security account for
only a tiny proportion, compared with the large number of Taiwan
visitors.
</P>
<P>
Tang noted that some people in Taiwan made improper
exaggeration of these cases, pointing out that this will be
harmful to the normal development of the cross-straits relations.
</P>
<P>
He said that the direct postal, commercial and transport links
across the Taiwan Straits is the most pressing issue to safeguard
Taiwan compatriots' rights and interests, and it is inevitable to
mention their rights and interests without the direct three links.

NEW DELHI, July 12 (Xinhua) -- India has decided to suspend air
strikes and scale down use of certain weapons in Kargil area of
Kashmir as intruders have begun pulling out.
</P>
<P>
It was officially announced here Monday that "it was agreed
that during this pull out period there would be no air strikes.
Some ground weapons will also not be used".
</P>
<P>
The decision to suspend the air attacks follows a meeting
between Directors General of Military Operations of India and
Pakistan at the Wagah border on Sunday during which the
"modalities for early withdrawal of Pakistani troops were agreed
to".
</P>
<P>
An official release said that Pakistan army was in the process
of pulling out from pockets in Mushkoh sector of Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
"Their (the intruders) withdrawal from Drass and Batalik
sectors is of very little consequence since almost all of these
areas have been already cleared" by Indian troops, the release
said.
</P>
<P>
However, it said "there is no ceasefire or cessation of
hostilities except on the use of air strikes and some ground-based
weapons".
</P>
<P>
The military operation was still continuing and "there is no
question of pulling out forces from the Kargil sector or anywhere
else", it said.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's population will reach 10.1
million this year with an annual growth rate of about two percent
in the last four years which is the fastest growing rate in
sub-Saharan countries, according official estimates.
</P>
<P>
Zambia's population jumped from 9.3 million in 1995 to the
present level, or increased about three times in the last three
decades from 3.5 million in 1963 when it earned its independence
from Britain.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Minister of Finance and Economic Development Godfrey
Simasiku said with the growing population, aging population has
become one of the major challenges facing the southern African
country.
</P>
<P>
Zambian newspaper, The Post, Monday quoted the deputy minister
as saying at the World Population Day, that as a less developed
country, Zambia depends on families to support the elderly.
</P>
<P>
"However, the traditional support systems for the elderly are
deteriorating. Urbanization and industrialization and other
aspects of development are disrupting family structures," the
official said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the alarming growth rate has intensified the demand
for the limited social and economic services such health,
education, housing and employment, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said poverty reduction and development will not be
sustainable if the rapid population growth is not properly
tackled.

<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, July 12 (Xinhua)-- Central China's Hubei Province has
suffered an economic loss of over 4.6 billion yuan from repeated
floods since June.
</P>
<P>
Since mid-June, heavy rain hit the province at the middle of
the Yangtze River, causing severe floods.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the provincial flood control and drought relief
headquarters show that by July 10, 11.3 million people were
affected by the floods and 360,000 people were once besieged by
floods.
</P>
<P>
The floods damaged nearly 100,000 residential houses, toppled
down 34,000 houses, causing a death toll of 36 people.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Police Form Task Force To Fight Economic Crimes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Police in Shanghai, China's
largest leading economic and financial center, announced here
today that they have formed a special task force to deal with the
surging economic crimes.
</P>
<P>
The force, titled General Investigation Team Against Economic
Crimes, will focus on cracking down on criminal offenses in
various economic activities, such as financial fraud, sabotage of
financial and market order and tax evasions, said Zhou Guoxiong, a
spokesman for the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau.
</P>
<P>
"Economic crimes are a new type of criminal offense which didn'
t emerge in China until the early 1980s," noted Zhou.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the number of such crimes grows extremely
rapidly, rocketing to several thousand a year at present from only
several dozens a year at the end of the 1980s. Money involved in
some recent cases even reached several hundred million yuan.
</P>
<P>
"At present, economic crimes are spreading from cities and the
coastal regions to the rural and interior areas, and criminal
offenders in such cases have become increasingly smart and
professional," he added.
</P>
<P>
According to Liu Yungeng, director of the Shanghai Public
Security Bureau, Shanghai police will intensify their cooperation
with the local financial, tax administrations, customs and other
relevant departments, to deal a severe blow on any economic crimes
and safeguard a smooth and sound growth of the economy of the
city.

<HEADLINE> No Progress Made by IMF Mission to Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Discussions between the Kenyan
government and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) have failed
to resolve the stalemate over the resumption of talks for a new
aid package.
</P>
<P>
The IMF team visiting Kenya has agreed to delay the publication
of its report for three months to give Kenyan Finance Minister
Francis Msakhalia time to implement some key measures in the
budget released last month, the East African weekly reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The eight-man team, which will leave Nairobi Tuesday, arrived
in the east African country last month and held discussions with
government officials for assessment of the economic policy and
progress of governance issues.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted a source as saying that the implementation of
the budget measures might persuade IMF executive directors to
approve the resumption of talks for a new enhanced structural
adjustment facility.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the IMF suspended its loan of 205 million U.S. dollars
to Kenya, mainly for the country's poor governance and widespread
corruption.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government has since been unable to convince the
agency to resume funding.
</P>
<P>
According to the IMF team, any resumption of the loan program
would have to be approved by the donor government representatives
and at present they feel "there has been little genuine progress
in eroding the culture of corruption and politicizing financial
management in Kenya."
</P>
<P>
They also urged Kenya to speed up the full implementation of a
judicial review report by Justice Richard Kwach.
</P>
<P>
The IMF team recommended that the tendering process in the
country be made transparent with the publication of tender
winners, contract prices, and runners-up and the prices they had
offered.
</P>
<P>
The delay in appointing financial controllers also came under
scrutiny of the IMF team, because ministers in Kenya have lost
control over the budgetary process in their absence.
</P>
<P>
The suspension of IMF loan in 1997 has worsened Kenya's
development, contributing to the economic growth deceleration from
4.6 percent in 1996 to 2.3 percent in 1997 and 1.8 percent in
1998.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Minister Urges to Sack Corrupt Ranks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The only way to to wipe out
corruption in Kenya is to sack corrupted civil servants employed
just after independence in 1963, Kenyan Minister of Home Affairs
Shariff Nassir said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"Unless they were sacked, they would influence the present
generation of workers," Nassir was quoted by Monday's Kenya Times
newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
About two-thirds of the civic servants should be sacked and
replaced by young officials, he said.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2002, all corrupt people holding senior posts in
the government will have retired and things will be different, the
minister noted.
</P>
<P>
The culture of demanding bribes is widespread by civil servants
employed during the 1960s and 1970s, Nassir pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The corrupt officials often alleged that they were being
discriminated on the tribal basis when they eventually fired, he
added.
</P>
<P>
The minister also challenged the members of parliament (MP) who
were shouting about corruption to report the culprits to the
police for action, saying that only going to press would not help
curb the vice.
</P>
<P>
He threatened to expose the corrupt records of MPs and other
leaders who keep accusing the government of corruption.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Parliament Starts Debate on Fiscal Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Parliament Monday started
a four-day televised debate on the long-awaited 1999 fiscal
budget.
</P>
<P>
The debate is expected to produce tirades against the
government's overall performance by lawmakers, observers said.
</P>
<P>
The budget bill, endorsed by the cabinet in April, pegged
revenue for 1999 at 3.2 billion U.S. dollars and spending at 5.5
billion dollars, higher compared with the respective figures of
2.9 billion dollars and 5.2 billion dollars for 1998.
</P>
<P>
The bill also introduced a whopping 30 percent tax on
alcoholic beverages, tobacco and other non-essential commodities
and increased gasoline prices by 2,000 Lebanese pounds (about 1.3
dollars) per 20 liters.
</P>
<P>
The government is struggling to bring public debt down from
123 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) to 98 percent by 2003,
and cut the budget deficit to five percent of GDP from its current
15 percent.
</P>
<P>
More than 50 lawmakers have asked to address the 128-seat house
in the debate televised live by Beirut's six state-run and private
networks.
</P>
<P>
Local media said most of lawmakers are expected to use the
discussion of budget to unleash a vast range of attacks against
the government of Salim Hoss in order to please public opinion in
the run-up to next year's parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
But observers said the budget will finally be passed with a
handsome majority because Syria will not allow a no-confidence
vote to cause domestic political disputes in advance of the
anticipated resumption of the Arab-Israeli peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
With 35,000 troops stationed in Lebanon as peacekeepers, Syria
is the country's undisputed power broker.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Welcomes Ceasefire Agreement in DR Congo </HEADLINE>

<P>
CAIRO, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Egypt has expressed welcome to a
ceasefire agreement worked out by warring parties in the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo), the national Al-Gomhuria
daily reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the Foreign Ministry reiterated Sunday night
Egypt's backing to the efforts aimed at realizing peace in the
Great Lakes region in Central Africa.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman, whom the pro-government paper did not identify,
said Egypt is ready to support any peace agreement and make
contributions to its implementation.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman voiced his country's hope that the rebel groups
would join the efforts to seek a peaceful settlement in a bid
forge peace, security and stability in DR Congo.
</P>
<P>
Congolese President Laurent Kabila, along with his foreign
military allies - Angola, Namibia and Zimbabwe signed the
ceasefire accord late Saturday in Lusaka, Zambia, with Uganda and
Rwanda, which have backed the rebels, aimed at ending an 11-month
old civil war in DR Congo.
</P>
<P>
But the step was overshadowed by the failure of the three rebel
groups to sign the agreement. The rebels were barred by other
signatories from signing the accord because of a rebel dispute
over who would represent the main group, the Congolese Rally for
Democracy.

<HEADLINE> Green Food Industry Flourishes in Inner Mongolia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Rich in forests, grassland and
cropfield, north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has
turned all these natural advantages into real value and is
enjoying fast-growing green food industry for the present.
</P>
<P>
Since the region initiated a project to develop the industry in
1992, a total of 65 such businesses have emerged, developing 148
kinds of green food such as mutton, beef, dairy food, food
processed from wild plants, according to the latest statistics
from the green food development center in Inner Mongolia.
</P>
<P>
About 350,000 tons of such food are processed annually,
generating an annual output value of 1.9 billion yuan. Nearly 20
kinds of such products are exported overseas to countries such as
Japan, the Republic of Korea and Arabic nations.
</P>
<P>
Inner Mongolia, with 1.183 million sq. km of land, has the
greatest acreage of grassland and forest among all the province-
level regions in China, which amount to 87 million hectares and 32
million hectares, respectively.
</P>
<P>
"Inner Mongolia is also know as a pristine piece of land, as a
result of its relatively less developed industrial economy and
therefore it is comparatively free of pollution," said Zhao Jiwen,
director of the region's green food development center.
</P>
<P>
Zhao added that Inner Mongolia's geological location also puts
it in advantageous position in terms of market access since it is
adjacent eight Chinese provinces and autonomous regions, and
borders Mongolia and Russia in the north.
</P>
<P>
The region has mapped out a strategy to develop its economy in
the 21st century with the stress laid on boosting its advantageous
green food sector.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Coal Export Up 24 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 12 (Xinhua)-- China exported 17.79 million tons
of coal during the first half of this year, up 24 percent over the
same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The latest issue of the "China Coal News" quoted an official
from the State Administration of Coal Industry as saying that
China's coal export witnessed substantial increase in the first
quarter because of the need to fulfill last year's contract. He
added that since April, the industry's export dropped "by a big
margin" amid declining coal prices.
</P>
<P>
China produced 406.8 million tons of coal in the first five
months of this year, a fall of 6.52 percent from the same period
last year, according to an earlier report by the State
Administration of Coal Industry.
</P>
<P>
The reduced coal output, which accounts for 39.4 percent of
this year's 1.03-billion-ton target, was in response to a slack
market demand.
</P>
<P>
Also by the end of May, China had closed down 23,168 small coal
mines, which accounted for 89.8 percent of the total number to be
shut down this year.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the country would continue to close its
door on small coal mines, which are wasteful and pollutant.

<HEADLINE> Wood New Zealand to Open Office in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Wood New Zealand (WNZ), the
market development arm of New Zealand wood products and forestry
industries, will open its first offshore office in September in
Shanghai, the biggest city in China.
</P>
<P>
The Export News of New Zealand reported Monday that the office
will be the first of a permanent network of "centers of activity"
the organization plans to establish throughout Japan, Southeast
Asia, China, the Republic of Korea and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Staffed primarily by Chinese nationals working on behalf of the
New Zealand Wood Products Industry, the Shanghai office will be
involved in generic promotion, market research, market
intelligence gathering, technical support and the identification
of opportunities for product development, according to the
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Gerald Hunt, chairman of WNZ's implementation group, was quoted
as saying that recent restrictions placed on the harvest of
China's native timbers have opened the way for New Zealand pine to
serve as a substitute timber.
</P>
<P>
"The challenge now is to ensure the Chinese receive the right
information about how to use our pine," he said.
</P>
<P>
Opening the office demonstrates commitment to the Chinese
market, Hunt said.
</P>
<P>
"We need to demonstrate to the Chinese, as we do in all our key
 markets, that we are serious about developing a long-term
commitment to their market needs," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the Export News, Hunt led a team to China this
month to sort out final details ahead of the office opening, to
reinforce links with Chinese industry groups, officials and users
of wood products and to run a series of seminars on the use of New
Zealand pine.
</P>
<P>
The WNZ was established last year by New Zealand forest
companies to promote and market New Zealand wood products in key
offshore markets.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Ministerial Delegation Visits East Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's ministerial delegation
arrived in Dili, capital of East Timor, in Monday morning for a
short visit ahead of the United Nations-sponsored direct ballot on
a wide-ranging autonomy for the territory, scheduled late next
month.
</P>
<P>
The delegation, consisting of 16 ministers led by Coordinating
Minister for Political Affairs Feisal Tanjung, was welcomed by
East Timor Governor Abilio Jose Osorio Soares, chief of the
regional military command Maj. Gen. Adam R. Damiri and other local
officials, according to Antara News Agency.
</P>
<P>
After a meeting with local officials, the ministers will split
and visit several places for other talks.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Affairs Minister Ali Alatas held a closed-door meeting
with Chief of the U.N. Mission in East Timor (UNAMET) Ian Martin,
while Tanjung met with personnel of the East Timor military
command and the coordinator of the Peace and Stability Commission.
</P>
<P>
Coordinating Minister for Economy, Finance and Industry
Ginandjar Kartasasmita will meet with officials of the Agency for
Regional Development while Information Minister M. Yunus Yosfiah
will meet with officials of the radio and TV stations as well as
with officials from the Media Center.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman of the Task Force on the Implementation of the Ballot
in East Timor Dino Pati Djalal said the delegation will leave for
Jakarta Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The delegation's flying visit came two days after U.N.
Secretary General Kofi Annan announced a three-day delay in voters
registration for the popular consultation from July 13 to July 16.
</P>
<P>
According to the original schedule, the registration was to
begin on June 22 but this was postponed to July 13 due to security
considerations.
</P>
<P>
Based on the May 5 agreement signed by Indonesia, Portugal and
the United Nations, registration inside and outside East Timor
will take place for 20 days.
</P>
<P>
Registration in East Timor will take place in approximately 700
registration centers and voting in 200 polling stations. Outside
East Timor, special registration centers will be opened in
Jakarta, Yogyakarta, Surabaya, Denpasar (Bali), Ujungpandang
(South Sulawesi), Sydney, Darwin, Perth, Melbourne, Lisbon,
Maputo, Macao and New York.
</P>
<P>
The U.N.-brokered direct ballot, in which the East Timorese
will determine whether to accept wide-ranging autonomy in
Indonesia or become independent, has been postponed from August 8
to August 21 or 22.
</P>
<P>
The former Portuguese colony of East Timor was integrated into
Indonesia in 1976 in a move never recognized by the United
Nations, which still considers Portugal as the administering power
of the territory.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Arrest 1,700 Robbery Suspects in 1998/99 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian police arrested
some 1, 700 people involved in 786 armed robberies, recovering
property worth some 300, 000 U.S. dollars in the past fiscal year,
according to the Tanzanian Ministry of Home Affairs.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has expressed worries that a lot of armed
robberies had taken place in western regions of Kigoma and Kagera
where refugees are taking shelter, the Guardian reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Citing statistics released by the ministry at the ongoing
parliamentary session in the central city of Dodoma, the paper
said that 117 armed robbery cases were reported in Kigoma while
107 reported in Kagera in the past fiscal year from July 1, 1998
to June 30 this year.
</P>
<P>
The police attributed the rampant armed robberies in these
regions to the influx of weapons from war-torn Democratic Republic
of Congo and Burundi.
</P>
<P>
During the period, Tanzanian capital Dar es Salaam registered
90 cases, while the southwest region Mbeya on the border with
Malawi and Zambia recorded 58.

<P>
The registry said the report, based on 1995 figures, was the
most accurate indication of New Zealand's cancer rates ever
published, because doctors were not bound to report all cases till
1994.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand has a population of about 3.8 million. In 1995,
there were 7,422 cancer deaths and 15,865 people diagnosed with
cancer.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, New Zealand has the highest rate of
deaths from bowel cancer and the second highest death rate from
breast cancer and cervical cancer among the OECD countries
surveyed.
</P>
<P>
Jo Bransgrove, chief executive of the registry, said, "It is an
appalling situation for New Zealand and we really need to do
something about it."
</P>
<P>
She blamed the high cancer rate on smoking and high fat
consumption, and urged the New Zealand Government to levy higher
taxes on cigarettes and spend more money on cancer research and
anti-cancer education campaigns.

<HEADLINE> Wellington Businesses Support Currency Union: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Merging the New Zealand and
Australian dollars has got the thumbs up from Wellington business
people, the Wellington-based Evening Post newspaper reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Evening Post-BRC (Business Research Committee) Economic
Index shows strong support for New Zealand to enter a currency
union with Australia or the United States, with most saying New
Zealand is too small to stand alone.
</P>
<P>
The Evening Post said that BRC Marketing and Social Research
surveys decision makers at Wellington businesses every two months.
In the latest poll, 49 percent said they would support a currency
union, with another 9 percent saying their support would depend on
what country New Zealand is merging with.
</P>
<P>
Asked which country New Zealand should seek a common currency
with, 65 percent said Australia, and 26 percent said the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Those polled pointed to the size of New Zealand as the main
reason for their opinion.
</P>
<P>
"We are too damn small. We are like a chicken's playground,
henpecked until there is nothing. We need help economically," one
business leader was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Others pointed to advantages in trade and travel, or said the
New Zealand dollar would be more stable.
</P>
<P>
"Our currency is very influenced by the Australian or American
dollar, it should be formally linked to either country...The
benefits of such links to New Zealand would be tremendous," a
business man said.
</P>
<P>
Another of those surveyed said their industry is hard hit by
exchange rate differences. "An alliance with the likes of
Australia would help. We do not have the working population to
sustain our dollar," he said.
</P>
<P>
Of those surveyed 32 percent said "No" to a currency union,
with most pointing to the loss of independence.
</P>
<P>
"I think that we do quite a nice job of managing our monetary
policy. If we went into a union we would lose it," a business
leader commented.
</P>
<P>
"I think we can stand alone. I do not think we need the
Australians," said another.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Shipping Industry Not Ready for Y2K </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Monday that actions should have been taken earlier to help the
country's shipping industry to solve the Year 2000 (Y2K)
millennium bug or the Y2K problem.
</P>
<P>
The Y2K Readiness and Contingency Center (RCC) under the
Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC) said it is
still trying to assess the effects of the Y2K problem on the local
shipping industry when the problem itself suggests organizations
should already be at the final stages of their compliance efforts.
</P>
<P>
Reports by the Y2K-RCC stated that maritime agencies attached
to the department showed low level of Y2K compliance.
</P>
<P>
As of June 14 this year, the Maritime Industry Authority has
only completed 38 percent of their Y2K program; the Philippine
Ports Authority, 78 percent; Cebu Ports Authority, 40 percent; and
the Philippine Coast Guard, 27 percent.
</P>
<P>
There are five common stages for a Y2K compliance program,
namely, awareness, assessment, renovation or remediation, testing
and implementation.
</P>
<P>
The Y2K problem may affect navigation, communications, safety
and security systems, ballasting and electrical systems of ships.
</P>
<P>
The DOTC created in May the Y2K-RCC, which focuses on three key
clusters, namely, air and maritime, land and rail and
telecommunications, to coordinate Y2K activities of all its
sectoral offices and attached agencies.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian President Leaves for OAU Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
left the Mediterranean port city of Alexandria Monday for Algiers,
Algeria, to take part in the 35th summit of the Organization of
African Unity (OAU) due late in the day.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak will address the summit on the latest developments in
the Mideast peace process, Egypt's Middle East News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The Arab-Israeli conflict and peace process have always been
major subjects of the OAU summits as African countries side with
the Arab people, the Palestinians in particular, in their
struggles to recover the territories occupied by Israel and
restore their legitimate rights.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak's speech will also dwell on current African issues,
Egypt's efforts to settle disputes on the African continent and
its views on ways of fostering economic cooperation among African
countries, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
In remarks carried by Al Gomhuria daily on Monday, Mubarak said
his participation in the summit is aimed at enriching constructive
dialogs on solving Africa's problems, including border conflicts,
civil wars, debts and poverty.
</P>
<P>
As the first Arab country to sign a peace treaty with Israel,
Egypt has been playing a key role in mediating the Arab-Israeli
peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Egypt also is keen on seeking solutions to the civil wars in
Sudan, Somalia and the Democratic Republic of Congo, and the
border conflicts between Eritrea and Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak told the newspaper that he will meet with leaders of
other African countries on the sidelines of the OAU summit.

<P>
ANKARA, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Eleven people were wounded in a
bomb explosion in eastern Turkey late Sunday night, the
semi-official Anatolia News Agency reported Monday.

<P>
The agency said the bomb exploded at Portakal Pastry Shop in
the building of Van Municipality in Van province bordering Iran,
leaving 11 people wounded.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh to Set up 4 Seismological Observatories </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 12 (Xinhua) --- The Bangladesh government will soon
set up four seismological observations in the country to record
scientific data on tremor and monitor relevant agro-meteorological
issues, The Bangladesh Observer newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
A seismological observatory would be an institution equipped
with different instruments to record accurate data about the
intensity, direction, duration, distance and nature of tremor, and
the scientific data recorded by the observatory are mainly used
for research and predicting any possible disaster.
</P>
<P>
The Meteorological Department will construct the observatories
at an estimated cost of 12.5 million taka (about 260,000 U.S.
dollars) under a government-financed project called
Agro-meteorological and Seismological Improvement Project. The
implementation of the project will be supervised by Ershad
Hossain, director of the Meteorological Department.
</P>
<P>
Officials at the Meteorological Office said an international
tender will soon be floated by the authorities to appoint a
consultant for the project.
</P>
<P>
Three seismological observatories will be set up in three
Divisional Headquarters in Dhaka, Chittagong and Sylhet while one
in Rangpur district town.
</P>
<P>
The officials said the country's only seismological observatory
was set up at Jhautala in Chittagong in the early 1960s. "Many of
its instruments are now too old to indicate accurate scientific
data regarding tremors. It is difficult to ascertain epicenter of
the tremors from the lone observatory at Chittagong," a scientist
of the Meteorological Department said.
</P>
<P>
The old seismological observatory at Jhautala will be brought
under a renovation scheme. "It will also work in conjunction with
the new observatory," the officials said.
</P>
<P>
The year 2001 has been fixed as the deadline for the project
implementation.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Calls For Int'l Cooperation on Migration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, July 12 (Xinhua) -- A high-ranking Myanmar immigration
official has called for international cooperation, particularly
among neighboring countries, to prevent undocumented migrants from
becoming a source of threat to the political stability and
security of the country of origin.
</P>
<P>
"We do hope that this problem will not be an issue in the year
2015," said Myanmar Minister of Immigration and Population U Saw
Tun at a ceremony here Sunday marking the 1999 World Population
Day.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that Myanmar's favorable population-to-land
ratio and fertile land are the main attractions to the people from
neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, he said, many people from Myanmar, for economic
reasons and better job opportunities, have found attractive
employment in neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
Realizing that migration, including irregular and undocumented
immigration, has both positive and negative dimensions, he
stressed the need to address the issue in a comprehensive and
balanced manner.
</P>
<P>
He appealed for the recognition that every nation has the
sovereign right to safeguard its borders and improve its migration
or immigration laws.
</P>
<P>
He expressed Myanmar's determination to continue to play an
active role in the world efforts to tackle the issue of
population, while strengthening its collaboration and cooperation
with all nations and international organizations.

<HEADLINE> Shandong Set to Reform Export Mix </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QINGDAO, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Shandong, a coastal province in
east China, has planned to increase efforts in restructuring its
export mix, in a bid to give big push to the growth of local
exports.
</P>
<P>
Shandong has become one of the country's major exporters. It
handled nearly 10.4 billion U.S. dollars worth of exports in 1998,
accounting for 12 percent of the local gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
In the past two decades, local foreign trade grew at an average
rate of 16 percent annually, with exports rising 13 percent per
year.
</P>
<P>
But high-tech and high value-added products are only a small
part of local exports and the proportion of electro-machinery in
local exports is only half of the national average.
</P>
<P>
It is imperative for the province to improve its irrational
export mix, which has checked the further development of local
foreign trade, Governor Li Chunting said last week.
</P>
<P>
Priority will be given to the reorientation of the export
market, as a guideline for steering the re-focus of export
commodities.
</P>
<P>
The province will also place emphasis on the development of the
five major export-oriented sectors of electro-machinery, textiles
and garments, chemicals and pharmaceuticals, building materials,
and agricultural products.
</P>
<P>
It will spare no effort in promoting the presence and image of
local name-brand products in international markets.
</P>
<P>
At present, the governor said, efforts will be concentrated on
increasing the export of small complete sets of equipment.
</P>
<P>
Shandong is now able to export 134,000 small complete sets of
equipment, which are expected to have big market potentials in
developing countries.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Congratulates OAU Session </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji sent a
congratulatory letter to the 35th ordinary session of the
Organization of African Unity (OAU) Assembly of heads of state and
government, which starts in Algiers on Monday. The text of the
letter runs as follows:
</P>
<P>
On the occasion of the convocation of the 35th Ordinary Session
of the OAU Assembly of Heads of State and Government and the Third
Ordinary Session of the African Economic Community, I wish to
extend, on behalf of the Chinese Government and people, our warm
congratulations to the Sessions.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 36 years, the OAU has made outstanding
contribution to the struggle for national independence in Africa,
the promotion of concerted efforts by African countries to
safeguard peace and stability on the continent, and the
advancement of regional cooperation and economic development.
Meanwhile, it has actively participated in international affairs
and worked hard to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests
of African nations. As a result, Africa has become an important
force in the international arena. At this historical juncture
when mankind is entering a new millennium, African countries,
summing up their experience, are working actively to respond to
the opportunities and challenges brought about by the changes in
the international situation. They have made unremitting efforts
and constant progress in exploring ways of development suited to
their respective national conditions so as to attain the
fundamental goal of national rejuvenation. Although there are
still many difficulties and problems facing Africa, we always
believe that the African continent is a promising continent. It
will be able to surmount difficulties and enter the new century
with a new look as long as African countries can achieve stability,
spare no efforts in getting stronger, and strengthen solidarity
and coordination among themselves, and get sincere assistance from
international community.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Government has all along attached importance to
Africa. It is always part and parcel of China's independent
foreign policy of peace to enhance our solidarity and cooperation
with the vast number of developing countries, including those in
Africa. China shares extensive common interests with Africa. The
great China-Africa friendship, which has grown through the long
years of common struggle, has withstood the test of time and
vicissitudes in the world, and it has grown stronger and developed
further in the new situation. Being the largest developing
country, China wishes to increase consultation with Africa to
enhance mutual understanding, expand consensus, promote
cooperation and work together to safeguard the legitimate rights
and interests of developing countries. China is ready to build a
21st-century-oriented friendly partnership with Africa of long-
term stability and all-round cooperation.
</P>
<P>
I wish the meetings a complete success.

<HEADLINE> Southern China In Warm, Damp Climate A Million Years Ago </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have concluded
that a million years ago southern China was in a warm, damp,
forest-friendly climate.
</P>
<P>
The conclusion is based on a study of fossilized vertebrates
that were discovered in Anfu County in east China's Jiangxi
Province in July 1998.
</P>
<P>
The vertebrates are identified as animals from the Pleistocene
dating back nearly a million years and coming from several species
like proboscides, cloven-hoofed, carnivores, insectivores, and
herbivores.
</P>
<P>
The new samples are important for the study of the geography,
environment, and climate of southern China in pre-historic times.

they have developed an interceptive net that can prevent either
civil or military planes from crashing as they take off or land.
</P>
<P>
Lian Yongfu, a senior engineer from the headquarters of the Air
Force of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) who led the research
project, said the special fencing net is made of an unnamed new
material that is coated with of high-performance paint, which has
proved to be superior to steel-wire in terms of efficiency and
long term use.
</P>
<P>
The newly developed nets have been installed in China's civil
and military airports.
</P>
<P>
The net fencing installed in Zhuhai airport in southern China's
Guangdong Province successfully prevented a foreign airliner from
crashing during landing because of the failure of its brake system
a year ago, according to Lian, who led a group that developed the
Air Force's first-generation fencing net in 1974.
</P>
<P>
Tests show that the net has a success rate of 100 percent, Lian
said, adding that all kinds of home-built planes, including the
latest mode of fighters, have been employed for the tests.

<HEADLINE> East Timor Ballot May be Delayed Again: UNAMET </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Mission in East
Timor (UNAMET) Sunday indicated the possibility of a second delay
in the scheduling of a popular consultation on the future of East
Timor, The Jakarta Post reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after announcing a decision by U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan to move back voter registration, UNAMET chief Ian
Martin said Annan would later announce the exact date of the
ballot in East Timor after taking into account inputs from various
sides, including the UNAMET and the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the U.N. Security Council on Saturday, Annan
postponed voter registration for three days to July 16 to allow
time for concrete measures to improve the security situation in
East Timor after a high-level visit of Indonesian officials to the
territory scheduled on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The delegation's agenda includes holding talks with Martin.
Among the eight cabinet ministers will be Minister of Foreign
Affairs Ali Alatas, Minister of Defense and Security Gen. Wiranto,
and Coordinating Minister for Political Affairs and Security
Feisal Tanjung.
</P>
<P>
Citing incidents in Maliana, Viqueque and Liquica in which
violence involving the UNAMET took place over the past two weeks,
Annan said the security situation remained a serious concern
despite the deployment of UNAMET personnel.
</P>
<P>
Martin said Indonesia would have to bring armed civilian groups
under strict control, arrest those involved in the incidents,
re-deploy Indonesian military forces and disarm the warring
factions in order to meet the criteria for the operational phase
of the vote process to proceed.
</P>
<P>
The U.N.-brokered direct ballot, in which the East Timorese
will determine whether to accept wide-ranging autonomy in
Indonesia or become independent, has been postponed from August 8
to August 21 or 22.
</P>
<P>
The former Portuguese colony of East Timor was integrated into
Indonesia in 1976 in a move never recognized by the United
Nations, which still considers Portugal as the administering power
of the territory.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesia government early this year announced it would
grant East Timor independence if the people in the territory
reject Indonesia's offer of a wide-ranging autonomy.

<HEADLINE> Croatian Newspaper Slams U.S. "Carrot and Stick" Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZEGRAB, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The Croatian newspaper, Courier,
said Sunday that the United States has been pursuing a "carrot and
stick" policy toward the region of the former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
In a signed article, the paper said that the "carrot and stick"
approach constitutes part of the pragmatism in the U.S. foreign
policy.
</P>
<P>
It noted that the United States has all sorts of tools to
resort to when dealing with disobedient countries. They include
democracy, human rights standards, freedom of speech and the Hague
tribunal.
</P>
<P>
Seeking quick success and instant benefits by hook or by crook
has been a striking feature of the U.S. policy toward the region
of the former Yugoslavia, the article said.
</P>
<P>
The United States has strategic interests in Croatia as well as
in Yugoslavia, the paper said, citing security and economic
interests as reasons.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that like Yugoslavia, Croatia has also tasted
the bitterness of the U.S. "carrot and stick" approach.
</P>
<P>
While maintaining good relations with the United States is in
the interests of Croatia, it noted, Croatia recently received a
warning card from the United States over the issue of accession to
the World Trade Organization.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka has launched a science
and technology personnel development project which aims to build
an institute-industry partnership for their mutual benefit, press
reports said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The project which connects industrial institutions with higher
educational and resource institutions is estimated to cost about
34 million U.S. dollars, the Daily News reported.
</P>
<P>
It quoted Minister of Science and Technology Batty Weerakoon as
saying that in the face of trade liberalization and the speed in
which new rules are being formulated by the World Trade
Organization, Sri Lanka has to face increasing competition.
</P>
<P>
The research institutions in the country therefore has a
positive role to play in catering to the needs of the country's
industrial sector, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Industrial training institutions have a major role in producing
vital human resources needed in this aspect, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Weerakoon said it is time for the three communities of
academics, researchers and industrialists to cultivate close links
in order to exchange knowledge and reap full benefits in their own
fields.
</P>
<P>
The project covers science and technology departments of seven
universities and five research and development institutions.
</P>
<P>
Under this project university teachers will be sent to industry
institutions to work for limited periods and industrial scientists
and technologists will be sent to work at universities and
research and development centers.

<HEADLINE> Poland to Boost Exports, Reduce Trade Deficits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Poland will take steps, including
providing loan guarantees, to boost exports and reduce huge trade
deficits.
</P>
<P>
The Polish newspaper Law and Economy quoted a report by the
economic committee under the Council of Ministers as saying that
the country is still burdened with heavy trade deficit this year.
</P>
<P>
The report said that in the first five months, Poland's exports
totaled 11.2 billion U.S. dollars and imports 16 billion dollars,
each representing a 6.4 percent drop in comparison with the same
period last year.
</P>
<P>
The trade deficit, more than 4.8 billion dollars in all, were
322 million dollars lower than the same period in 1998. The
reduction, however, was achieved at the expense of imports. The
report said this is an indication that the Polish economy is still
lingering in stagnation.
</P>
<P>
One of the causes leading to Poland's declining exports was
that Russia, the former second largest importer of Polish products,
has declined to the 11th place. In addition, Poland also saw a
sharp drop in barter trade with Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
It pointed out that under these circumstances, the Polish
government must increase loan guarantees for export goods and
allocate more money for export promotion efforts.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Boy Doing Well With Marrow Transplant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, July 12 (Xinhua) -- A seven-year-old boy suffering
from leukemia can walk again after a successful marrow transplant
from his different-blood-type sister recently at a military
hospital in southwest China's Chongqing city.
</P>
<P>
This is the first of its kind for children in China.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Mingxing was diagnosed with acute leukemia earlier this
year by the Daping Hospital affiliated to the No.3 Military
Medical University in this inland industrial heartland and it was
believed that he might live only half a year if no marrow
transplant could be done.
</P>
<P>
His sister, aged 9, was willing to make a donation but her
blood type was B and that of her brother, A.
</P>
<P>
Marrow transplant between different blood types might cause
kidney failure and hemolysis, doctors say. But, on June 18, Jiang
received the operation in spite of the risk, and after seven days,
he suffered a massive hemorrhage in the alimentary canal.
</P>
<P>
But his life was saved and a blood-type antigen test later
showed that his heart, liver, and spleen were functioning normally
and his hematogenic functions had recovered.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Foreign Exchange Reserves Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's net foreign Exchange
reserves decreased to 16.39 billion U.S. dollars in the week
ending July 7, from 16.41 billion dollars in the previous week,
the central bank said in its latest weekly report, quoted by The
Jakarta Post Monday.
</P>
<P>
Bank Indonesia attributed the fall in the country's net foreign
Exchange reserves to foreign debt repayment obligations.
</P>
<P>
The bank said net international reserves were still above the
14.7-billion-dollar target set by the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
Gross international reserves -- net foreign exchange reserves,
plus outstanding foreign exchange contracts -- also decreased to
26.87 billion dollars, from 26.90 billion dollars in the previous
week, the weekly report said.

<HEADLINE> Eastern Chinese Province Sets Tourism Development Goal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Shandong Province in east China has
mapped out an ambitious tourism development program targeting at
an annual tourism income of 74 billion yuan for the year 2005,
accounting for six percent of the local gross domestic product (
GDP) that year.
</P>
<P>
The earning will include 70 billion yuan from domestic tourists
and 500 U.S. dollars from overseas tourists.
</P>
<P>
The coastal province also plans to increase the tourism income
to 160 billion yuan by 2010, or eight percent of its GDP,
including 150 billion yuan from domestic visitors and 900 million
dollars from overseas visitors.
</P>
<P>
To this end, said Governor Li Chunting of the province over the
weekend, Shandong will form a new tourism system based on mountain
and coastal scenery, cultural relics, literary works, folk customs,
and ecological holiday resorts. It will increase construction of
accommodations, improve catering, entertainment, shopping, and
other services, and develop a more convenient traffic system.
</P>
<P>
In the past two decades, tourism had registered the fastest
growth among other economic sectors of the province, with domestic
visitors spending increasing at an average annual rate of 43
percent and overseas visitors, 41 percent.
</P>
<P>
Shandong now has 509 beauty spots and scenic attractions, more
than 150 star-graded hotels, and more than 300 travel services
that have contacts with more than 150 overseas counterparts.

<HEADLINE> Post-War Kosovo Harassed by Rampant Looting From Albanians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Looters from Albania are posing
the biggest threat to the safety of all ethnic communities in
Kosovo, Yugoslavia's official news agency Tanjug reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Quoting Zoran Andjelkovic, head of the provisional Kosovo
government, the report said Albanians illegally entering the
Yugoslav province have been looting the residents in Kosovo
regardless of their ethnic background.
</P>
<P>
As many as 3,000 vehicles were taken away from Pristina
residents within the last week alone, Andjelkovic said.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, two robberies were reported in the trouble-ridden
province. One was in Pristina, where seven Albanians broke into a
Gypsy family in the evening. NATO peacekeeping forces (KFOR)
intervened after receiving a call from the neighbor and arrested
three Albanians, with the other four getting away.
</P>
<P>
The other was in Kosovo Polje, where 10 Albanians looted and
burned the house of a Serbian resident in early afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Andjelkovic said that although KFOR leaders repeatedly claimed
their present military strength is not enough to guarantee the
safety of all ethnic communities in entire Kosovo, sufficient
facts proved that the KFOR could do more than what they are doing
now in this regard.

</P>
<P>
Chen Tianxiao, a State Economic and Trade Commission official,
was quoted as saying that China has so far approved 1,700 foreign-
funded pharmaceutical projects.

less government subsidy, and the country's growing population of
the elderly who need more and better medicare.
</P>
<P>
She said that the fledgling domestic biomedical sector,
including cloning and gene technologies, will follow the world
trend in becoming profitable.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investment is allowed in this sector and the State Drug
Administration is processing the applications for this, she said,
adding that more than 10 biomedicine are already in production.
</P>

U.S. dollars this year, as compared to 20.6 billion dollars last
year.

<HEADLINE> Fewer Firms Seeking Debt Relief in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Fewer Philippine firms are seeking
a debt moratorium from the Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC) amid the nation's ongoing economic recovery, the newspaper
Today said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The number of companies that filed for suspension of payment
dropped to just eight companies in the first half of the year from
19 companies in the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The total debt of the companies that sought relief dropped
almost 81 percent to only 18.11 billion pesos (452 million U.S.
dollars) in the first six months from last year's 92.88 billion
pesos (2.32 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The biggest amount of debts involved in these payment
suspension petitions was that of Uniwide Holdings Inc., the retail

payments on 11.1 billion pesos (277 million dollars) worth of
obligations.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines is reportedly starting to recover from a major
slump and was even cited by the International Monetary Fund (IMF)

financial crisis.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investment in Indonesia Fall 77 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Foreign direct investment approved
by the Indonesian government in the first six months of this year
plunged by 77.5 percent to 1.88 billion U.S. dollars, from 8.35
billion dollars during the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
According to data from the Investment Coordinating Board
(BKPM), licensed domestic investment in the first half dropped by
36.07 percent to 19.12 trillion rupiah (2.7 billion dollars), from
29.9 trillion rupiah (4.22 billion dollars) in the first semester
of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Asril Noer, an assistant to the state minister of investment,
said the number of approved foreign investment projects in the
period rose by 7.5 percent to 518 from 482 in the same period of
last year, despite a sharp drop in their value.
</P>
<P>
Approved domestic investment projects fell to 102 in the first
six months of this year, from 169 projects in the corresponding
period last year.
</P>
<P>
"However, we should be aware that not all of the approved
investment projects will be implemented," The Jakarta Post Monday
quoted Asril as saying.
</P>
<P>
Asril, who is also the BKPM's secretary, said the increase in
the number of approved foreign investment projects indicated a
shift in investors' interest from large-scale projects in previous
years to medium-scale projects.
</P>
<P>
Most of the projects were in export-oriented industries which
use natural resources, namely agribusiness, fisheries, the food
industry, plantations and mining, he said.
</P>
<P>
Japanese investors topped the list, committing more than 135
million dollars in investment as of the end of May. They were
followed by investors from South Korea and Australia.
</P>
<P>
Asril said the government had improved the investment climate
for domestic as well as foreign investors by issuing several new
deregulation measures.
</P>
<P>
"One of them is the delegation of authority to governors and
BKPMD (provincial investment offices) for issuing domestic
investment approval," he said.
</P>
<P>
As the chairman of the Investment Planning Board, State
Minister of Investment Marzuki Usman could now approve investment
projects worth up to 100 million dollars, Asril added.
</P>
<P>
Investments worth more than 10 million dollars previously
required the direct approval of the president.

<HEADLINE> Manchester United: We Won't Compete in FA Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Manchester United have insisted
they are standing by their decision not to defend the FA Cup.
</P>
<P>
Recent reports have suggested United have reached a new deal
with the Football Association, to pull out of the Worthington Cup
instead.
</P>
<P>
The treble winners sparked controversy by withdrawing from next
year's tournament in favour of competing in the inaugural FIFA
World Club Championships in South America next January.
</P>
<P>
But United spokesman Ken Ramsden said: "I have spoken with
chairman Martin Edwards and, as far as we are concerned, there are
no plans for us to return to the FA Cup competition.
</P>
<P>
"I know the idea pulling out of the Worthington Cup has been
put forward to give us the possibility of returning to the
competition but, so far, no further discussions have been held
with the FA.
</P>
<P>
"Myself and other United officials are aware of the speculation
surrounding this issue but there has certainly been no definite
solution, nor any further progress."
</P>
<P>
The claims were also dismissed by FA spokesman Adrian Bevington.
</P>
<P>
Bevington said: "We made our position fully clear following the
announcement at Old Trafford.
</P>
<P>
"We've explored every avenue possible with Manchester United
and ultimately that's why the decision was reached."
</P>
<P>
And a Football League spokesman also insisted that United were
committed to playing in the Worthington Cup.
</P>
<P>
The reports surfaced after Old Trafford boss Sir Alex Ferguson
said the club would reconsider their withdrawal if a practical
plan was worked out.
</P>
<P>
"To us, if someone comes up with a proper idea, I think the
club will look at it," he said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Sport Secretary Chris Smith has stepped into the row over
Manchester United's decision to pull out of the competition.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Smith, the Culture, Media and Sport Secretary told Sky News:
"Given the new circumstances, I very much hope that both the FA
and Manchester United will consider that as a possibility."
</P>
<P>
But the Football Association - which allowed United to withdraw
to relieve fixture congestion - called the idea "unworkable".

<HEADLINE> Nepal's Export Up, Import Down in 11 Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, July 11 (Xinhua) -- In the first 11 months of the
1998/99 fiscal year which ends in mid-July, Nepal has registered a
34.2 percent rise in export and a 2.9 percent drop in import,
Finance Minister Mahesh Acharya told the parliament Sunday.
</P>
<P>
While presenting the draft budget for the new fiscal year,
Acharya said that total export in the period has reached 33.21
billion rupees (488 million U.S. dollars), up 34.2 percent over
the same period of the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the total import has declined by 2.9 percent to
78.93 billion rupees (1.16 billion dollars), he said.
</P>
<P>
In the period, the export of woolen carpets and garments, major
foreign exchange earners for the kingdom, has grown by 15.7
percent and 37.1 percent respectively, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Acharya said that Nepal's export and import to and from India,
its biggest trading partner, have risen by 50.8 percent and 18.8
percent respectively, whereas the export to other countries has
increased by 26.4 percent as against the 12.2 percent drop in
import from them.
</P>
<P>
"The overall ratio of export to import has been 42.1 percent,"
he said.

<HEADLINE> Coulthard Wins British GP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SILVERSTONE, England, July 11 (Xinhua) -- David Coulthard
claimed the title at the incident-packed British Grand Prix here
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
With the win, he came the first home winner since Johnny
Herbert's triumph in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Another British driver Eddie Irvine finished second in his
Ferrari and Williams' Ralf Schumacher secured third.
</P>
<P>
Home success thrilled fans in a 100,000 crowd on a glorious
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
But the race was marred when Michael Schumacher suffered a
broken right tibia on the aborted first lap, ruling him out of at
least the next three races.
</P>
<P>
The German was airlifted to hospital after his Ferrari skidded
off the track on a bend at more than 200 kilometers and thumped
into a safety tyre barrier.
</P>
<P>
The incident overshadowed a race in which Damon Hill finished
fifth - but would give no more clues about his retirement date. "
We're going to have a few beers and think about it," he said.
</P>
<P>
After the race, Coutlhard said: "I feel absolutely fantastic.
</P>
<P>
"When I realised the team got me out in front of Eddie I knew I
could win.
</P>
<P>
"It was more nerve-wracking than at any time in my career
because it has been such a long time without a win.
</P>
<P>
"This is definitely the best feeling I have had in my career.
This is the one race win I would always trade for any other win."
</P>
<P>
The Scot in a McLaren took his chance after a mid-race
reshuffle which saw race leader Mika Hakkinen moving into the pits,
allowing Irvine to take the lead for the first time.
</P>
<P>
But the Finn developed a mechanical problem, and soon after
emerging from the pits was overtaken by his team-mate.
</P>
<P>
Coulthard then snatched the lead as Irvine made his stop for
fresh fuel and rubber, powering down the home straight just as his
Ferrari rival was emerging onto the track.
</P>
<P>
Hakkinen, for once experiencing the mechanical problems that
have blighted his Scottish team-mate's season, had to go into the
pits again for a 28-second stop and dropped to 11th.
</P>
<P>
Hakkinen's race effectively ended minutes later when his left
rear wheel suddenly flew off.
</P>
<P>
The tyre bounced along the gravel and rebounded onto the
circuit, almost hitting several cars which had to swerve to avoid
being hit.
</P>
<P>
Hakkinen went into the pits on three wheels to have a new tyre
fitted but emerged this time back in 17th spot.
</P>
<P>
Officials were forced to deploy the safety car again when
Jacques Villeneuve's race ended as he parked his British American
Racing car along the home straight.
</P>
<P>
That allowed Irvine to close right up on Coulthard as Hakkinen
was forced to make another charge from the back of the field.
</P>
<P>
Hakkinen's race finally came to an end of lap 37 when he was
forced to retire.
</P>
<P>
Despite not finishing the race, Hakkinen retains the season
points total lead with 40, followed by Schumacher with 32.
</P>
<P>
Irvine moves up to 32 points with Fretnzen on 26 and Coulthard
moving into fifth place with 22 points.
</P>
<P>
Ralf Schumacher has 19 in sixth place and now a real chance to
overtake his brother, who looks sure to miss the next few races.
</P>
<P>
Schumacher's crash came as the red flag appeared after two cars
stalled off the starting line.
</P>
<P>
That delayed the race's beginning by about 30 minutes as
Schumacher, who got out of the car on his own, was placed on a
stretcher and taken by helicopter to a local hospital.
</P>
<P>
The early medical report said he had broken his right leg but,
according to a Formula One spokesman, "was conscious and being air
lifted to hospital."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman called his condition stable and Schumacher is
reported to have telephoned his family to tell them he was OK.
</P>
<P>
The front end of Schumacher's red Ferrari folded up severely as
it hit a three-layer deep tire barrier - a recent addition at
Silverstone and one of several changes at the track to improve
safety.

<HEADLINE> Eastern Chinese Province Stopping Smuggling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The anti-smuggling war that began
in Fujian Province, east China, in May has achieved good results
as border police and customs officers have seized six boats that
were being used to smuggle goods.
</P>
<P>
The high speed, armor-clad boats are often used by smugglers to
carry cigarettes into coastal areas.
</P>
<P>
The State Council, China's highest governing body, and the
Ministry of Public Security have issued orders that these

CANBERRA, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Doubles specialist Todd
Woodbridge broke up the Woodies for this week's Davis Cup quarter-
final against the United States when he withdrew from the team on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Captain John Newcombe said Woodbridge, who forms one of the
world's top doubles units with Mark Woodforde, had decided to
withdraw because of a minor arm injury and a loss of form.
</P>
<P>
Newcombe said he would have preferred Woodbridge stayed in the
team but said the player felt he would let his teammates down in
the tie at Longwood Cricket Club in Brookline, Mass.
</P>
<P>
Woodbridge was replaced by Sandon Stolle, who is ranked No.3 in
the world in doubles, but Patrick Rafter might be called in to
partner Woodforde or Stolle.

<HEADLINE> Kashmiri Fighters Begin "Disengagement": Pak FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Foreign Minister Sartaj
Aziz Sunday said that Kashmiri Mujahideen (holy war fighters) have
began "disengagement" from the Kargil area where they had been
combating the Indian troops in the last two months.
</P>
<P>
"We have been informed that disengagement from the Kaksar
sector which began yesterday has been proceeding satisfactorily.
The disengagement from the Mashkoh sector will commence tonight,"
Aziz told journalists here at a news briefing in the Foreign
Office.
</P>
<P>
"Gradually the disengagement will be completed in the entire
(Kargil) area," he added.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister also told journalists that Pakistan and
India are in constant contacts to defuse the tension in Kashmir
since the Mujahideen began their "disengagement."
</P>
<P>
He said that Directors General of Military Observers of the two
countries met Sunday and agreed on the modalities for
de-escalation including sector-wise cessation of ground and air
operations to facilitate the Mujahideen's disengagement.
</P>
<P>
The "disengagement" of the Mujahideen is a result of the joint
statement Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif issued with U.S.
President Bill Clinton in Washington on July 4, in which Sharif
agreed to persuade the Mujahideen to withdraw from the positions
they occupied in the India-held Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
Sharif on Friday met with representatives of the Kashmiri
Mujahideen organizations and called on them to pull out of Kargil.
</P>
<P>
In the last two months, the Mujahideen have been fighting
against Indian troops in the Kargil area on the Indian side of the
Line of Control (LoC) in the disputed region of Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
"In the past few weeks, the Mujahideen action has been
gloriously successful as the just and legitimate cause of Kashmir
has engaged the international community's undivided attention
throughout this period," Aziz said.
</P>
<P>
He hinted that the international community should take
immediate efforts to facilitate the solution of the long-standing
Kashmir dispute between Pakistan and India.
</P>
<P>
"Today, a consensus has emerged that immediately after the
de-escalation in Kargil the focus must shift to the expeditious
solution of the Kashmir dispute, so that the one billion people
who inhabit South Asia can lead a life of peace and engage in the
endeavors for economic developments and prosperity," he said.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister also urged India to resume dialogue with
Pakistan to resolve bilateral disputes. "We also believe that both
India and Pakistan should honor their commitment to implementing
the Lahore Declaration in letter and spirit."
</P>
<P>
The Lahore Declaration, which was signed in February this year
and called on the two sides to resolve all outstanding issues
through dialogue, should "be revived immediately," according to
Aziz.
</P>
<P>
A Pakistani military spokesman also confirmed Sunday the
pullout of the Mujahideen from Kargil, but he said he had no
information about their movement after the withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman denied the Indian media reports that the Indian
troops are still moving in various parts of Kargil against the
Mujahideen.
</P>
<P>
The de-escalation is proceeding according to the agreed
procedure, he said, adding that "there has been no fire, no
physical engagement" in Kargil sector.
</P>
<P>
India lost 700 men and more than 1,200 were wounded in the
two-month Kargil conflict, according to the spokesman.

<HEADLINE> Hainan Leads Nation in Per Capita Housing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Hainan Province in south China now
leads the country in per capita housing with the average floor
space for urban residents amounting to 14.8 square meters.
</P>
<P>
Government officials say that by the first quarter of the year,
Hainan, also the country's youngest special economic zone, raked
in 3.75 billion yuan from sales of 83,000 units of state-
subsidized apartments.
</P>
<P>
Economic and practical apartment houses with floor space
totaling 3.92 million square meters have been constructed at a
cost of 3.75 billion yuan in this island province over the past
two years, with 2.66 billion yuan of the total contributed by
workers themselves.
</P>
<P>
A total of 363,000 workers in the province have joined the
public accumulative housing fund and have paid in a total 380
million yuan.
</P>
<P>
China started to introduce housing reform, which involves
selling houses to citizens instead of allocating houses to them as
a form of welfare, in the 1990s, and the deepening and
popularization of the housing reform has played a decisive role in
expanding the country's real estate market.
</P>
<P>
The country completed 350 million square meters of floor space
in urban areas last year. By the end of 1998, the per capita
living space of Chinese urban residents had grown to nine square
meters from 8.8 square meters in 1997.

<P>
Argentine captain Roberto Ayala's kick was saved by Brazil
goalkeeper Dida in the 78th minute, throwing away a golden chance
to level the score at 2-2.
</P>
<P>
Ayala took the kick after striker Martin Palermo, the first
choice penalty taker, missed three penalties in the first round
match against Colombia.
</P>
<P>
Ronaldo scored the winner early in the second half with his
fourth goal of the tournament as Brazil came from behind to beat
their bitter rivals and earn a semi-final against Mexico.
</P>
<P>
Juan Pablo Sorin put Argentina ahead before Rivaldo equalised
from a free kick in the first half.
</P>
<P>
Argentina had the best of the opening exchanges, taking an 11th
minute lead when Sorin scored with a left-foot shot from outside
the penalty area that ricocheted off a Joao Carlos and into the
goal.
</P>
<P>
In the 33rd minute, Rivaldo made his mark on the game when he
floated a free kick over the Argentine wall from the edge of the
area and into the top corner of the goal for an equaliser.
</P>
<P>
Ronaldo fired Brazil in front three minutes after the interval
with a low shot from outside the area after a neat passing move
involving Emerson Ferreira and Ze Roberto.

</P>
<P>
Zamorano's goal came after defender Pedro Reyes had twice

<HEADLINE> Cuban Diver Breaks China's Dominance to Win Platform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PALMA, Spain, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Cuban diver Jose Guerra broke
China's stranglehold on diving here on Sunday when he claimed the
gold in the men's platform in the 20th University Games.
</P>
<P>
The Cuban got 638.520 points for the gold, the only second one
slipping off Chinese divers' hand.
</P>
<P>
The silver went to Fernando Platas of Mexico, who collected 618.
180. Guerra's teammate Jesus Aballi came in third with 602.580.
</P>
<P>
"I am very happy with the win," Grerra said. "Today I dived
very, very well."
</P>
<P>
Ken Terauchi led the field in score until the last dive, a
fluffed reverse 3 1/2 somersault, which only earned him 39.780.
</P>
<P>
He finally slipped to a disappointing fourth position with a
total of 597.480.
</P>
<P>
China's hope to win their seventh diving gold was dashed when
Sun Shuwei, a world-renowned diver who won the platform gold in
1992 Olympics with a spectacular performance, bungled his last
dive, a back 3 1/2 somersault which brought him a meagre 28.710.
</P>
<P>
The 23-year-old unbelievably chose a dive with a difficulty
degree of 1.9 as his first.
</P>
<P>
"I am being plagued by a chronic waist injury, and cannot make
a dive of a higher difficulty degree," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sun, who failed in domestic trials for the 1996 Olympic Games
after a surgery of retinodialysis, an incubus constantly haunting
Chinese divers in the past, said he will try his best to qualify
for next years' Olympics.
</P>
<P>
"So long as I bring my best, I still can qualify for the Sydney
Olympics," he said.
</P>
<P>
China's Olympic diving trial will be held in October.
