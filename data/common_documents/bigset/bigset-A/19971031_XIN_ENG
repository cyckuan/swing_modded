<HEADLINE> Chinese Masters Leave for Retaining World Titles Overall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 30 (Xinhua) -- China's wushu masters Thursday
left for the Fourth World Wushu-Kungfu Championships slated for
November 3-8 in Rome to defending their titles in overall.
</P>
<P>
Some 800 Martial Arts masters from over 50 countries and
regions to vie for a total of 25 gold medals in both the forms and
full contact fighting events.
</P>
<P>
China sent 11 masters to Rome and is expected to make one third
of total golds. The team is mostly contained by the champions of
the China's Eight National Games ended in Shanghai last week.
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, the Chinese masters won 10 of 24 golds for the
first position in the team standings at the last championships in
Baltimore, the United States.
</P>
<P>
China is strong in the forms discipline which needs more
techniques and smoothment in movings, but is not good enough to
dominate the full contact fighting that requires more strength and
physics.
</P>
<P>
The biannual championships were initiated in 1991 in China.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Explain Secret Of Queen Insects' Long Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Two Swiss scientists have
attributed the extraordinarily long lifespans of queen insects to being
pampered, protected and waited upon, reported the science journal
Nature published here today.
</P>
<P>
Laurent Keller, of the University of Lausanne, and Michel
Genoud, of the University of Berne, compared 43 species of
colony-forming insects and found a strong link between the
longevity of the queen and the way the colony was formed, and its
social structure thereafter.
</P>
<P>
Queens live longest when they reign alone, surrounded by
workers able to fetch and carry and take risks. When queens
compete with other queens in the same colony, they die sooner.
</P>
<P>
Aging is not simply a matter of the machinery of life slowly
wearing out, but an evolutionary process which can produce
immensely long lives if that offers an advantage, said Keller and
Genoud.
</P>
<P>
In the case of the solitary queens, a long life is necessary in
order to establish a new colony and get it through its early
years. Then life becomes so simple and risk-free that it can go on
almost indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
While an ordinary ant generally expects a life of no more than
a month or two, queens average ten years, and in some species 28
years. The same is true with termites and bee, whose queens can
respectively reach the age of 11 and 5 or 6, said the report.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 30 (Xinhua) -- The Southern African
Development Community (SADC) said today that it unreservedly
supports the United Nations' sanctions against Angola's former rebel
he National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
"We want to make the sanctions stick," the South African Press
Association quoted SADC spokesman Koesi Moesi as saying.
</P>
<P>
Moesi said the sanctions against UNITA, Angola's former rebel
organization, were imposed in an attempt to make the group comply
with the terms of the Lusaka Peace Protocol and move more quickly
toward an effective unity government and an end to hostilities in
Angola.
</P>
<P>
He said the SADC heads of state will likely meet early
next month to discuss this issue.
</P>
<P>
SADC Executive Secretary Kaire Mbuende is expected to start
planning for the meeting when he arrives back in Gaborone from
Lesotho on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The UN Security Council on Wednesday voted to impose sanctions
on UNITA as a punishment for its failure to implement the peace
accords and relevant UN resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions, going into force from today, include air and
travel bans on UNITA members and their adult immediate family
members, closure of UNITA offices abroad and a ban on all fights
into Angola without the consent of the Angolan government.
</P>
<P>
The UN resolution also decided to extend the mandate of UN
peacekeepers in Angola until January 30, 1998.

<HEADLINE> EU Enjoys Trade Surplus With Third Countries in First Half </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, October 30 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU)
registered a trade surplus of more than 17 billion ECUs (some 22
billion U.S. dollars) with the rest of the world in the first half
of this year.
</P>
<P>
Extra-EU exports and imports rose by 12.2 percent and 10.2
percent respectively from a year ago, said a report published
Thursday by Eurostat, the EU's statistical office based in
Luxembourg.
</P>
<P>
Calling the growth "dynamic," Eurostat said the increase was
mainly due to a trade surge in the second quarter of this
year. The EU's trade balance with the rest of the world in the
same period last year was 10 billion ECUs (about 13 billion
dollars).
</P>
<P>
In contrast, intra-EU trade was up only 5.8 percent between
first halves of 1996 and 1997. But this was higher than the
increase of 3.4 percent recorded between first halves of 1995 and
1996.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 30 (Xinhua) -- The voters in the Republic of
Ireland started casting their ballots early today in order to
choose a new president, according to press reports from Dublin.
</P>
<P>
Among the five presidential contenders, Mary McAleese, a law
professor, is tipped to win the presidential race to replace
outgoing president Mary Robinson, who resigned in September just
short of a full seven year term to become United Nations High
Commissioner for Human Rights.
</P>
<P>
The survey conducted by the Irish Times newspaper Wednesday
revealed that McAleese, the candidate of the ruling Finna Fail
Party, remained 13 points ahead of the second favorite Mary
Banotti.
</P>
<P>
Banotti, 58, is a member of the European Parliament and
candidate of the main opposition Fine Gael party, is also
considered to snatch a large share of support in the election.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the other three candidates including well-known
Irish singer Rosemary Scallon, anti-nuclear campaigner Adi Roche
and retired police officer Derek Nally are unlikely to win the
race.
</P>
<P>
Voting among an electorate of 2.69 million people was due to
close at 2100 GMT and counting was to start on Friday, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
The first count under the country's proportional representation
election system is expected to be completed by 1700 GMT on Friday,
but further counts would be needed if no clear winner emerges in
the first count.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, U.S. Presidents Hold Press Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang
Zemin and U.S. President Bill Clinton have agreed that China and
the United States should strengthen cooperation in building a
strategic partnership oriented toward the 21st century, with a
view to promoting world peace and development.
</P>
<P>
This was stated by Jiang during a joint press conference by the
two presidents Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents also shared the view of holding regular
visits between the two countries' heads of state, facilitating a
Washington-Beijing presidential communications link, triggering
the mechanism of a regular exchange of visits by foreign ministers
and other cabinet officials, as well as strengthening cooperation
in economic, scientific and technological, cultural, educational
fields and in law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
Jiang described his talks with Clinton as "constructive and
fruitful," and believed that his ongoing visit could attain the
goal of enhancing mutual understanding, broadening common ground,
developing cooperation and building the future.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents also agreed to handle bilateral relations
and differences in line with the principles of mutual respect,
non-interference in each other's internal affairs, equality and
mutual benefit, and seeking common ground while putting aside
differences.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said that Jiang's visit to the United States gave them
the opportunity and the responsibility to build a future that is
more secure, more peaceful, more prosperous for both peoples.
</P>
<P>
The two countries share a profound interest in a stable,
prosperous and open Asia, and a strong interest in stopping the
spread of weapons of mass destruction and other sophisticated
weaponry, Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
He said he agreed to move ahead with the U.S.-China agreement
for cooperation concerning the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
</P>
<P>
In both China and the United States, trade has been a critical
catalyst for growth, and China is the fastest growing market in
the world for America's goods and services, Clinton said. He also
said the United States would "do everything possible to bring
China into the World Trade Organization."
</P>
<P>
Referring to the Taiwan issue, Jiang said that China wishes to
effect the peaceful reunification of the motherland by means of
implementing Deng Xiaoping's concept of "one country, two
systems."
</P>
<P>
But China is not committed to giving up the use of force in
this regard, he said, adding that this does not target the Taiwan
compatriots, but direct against the foreign force interfering in
Taiwan affairs and against the scheme that would attempt to
separate Taiwan from China.
</P>
<P>
On the human rights issue, Jiang said the current world is a
rich and diverse one, and concepts on democracy and human rights
and on freedoms are relative and specific ones. Therefore, they
should be determined by the specific national situation of
different countries.

French Foreign Ministry spokesman Jacques Rummelhardt said that
France would consider taking "appropriate measures" against Iraq
together with other United Nations Security Council members.

down by 0.2 percent from 802,000 in August.
</P>
<P>
It was the second consecutive decline but the sales still
marked the fourth consecutive month of sales at or above 800,000,
the longest such stretch in 19 years.
</P>
<P>
Regionally, sales of new homes plunged by 12.2 percent in the
Northeast, pushing the annual rate to the lowest in 16 months.
Sales also fell by 3.7 percent in the South. However, they jumped
by 9 percent in the West and rose 2.1 percent in the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
During the first nine months of the year, new home sales in the
U.S. were running 5.7 percent ahead of the corresponding period in
1996. The supply of new homes for sale in September and August was
the slimmest in four years.
</P>
<P>
That's in line with analysts expectations that sales will taper
off next year as pent-up demand for new housing wanes.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that the strong new home sales resulted from low
mortgage rates, plentiful jobs and steady income growth.
</P>
<P>
Nationally, the median price of a new single-family home --
meaning half sold for more and half for less -- was 142,000
dollars in September, up 2.2 percent from a year earlier.

<HEADLINE> Government Has 30 Days to Decide on Judges: Pak PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif said here today that his government has 30 days to
review the issue of the appointment of five judges to the Supreme
Court.
</P>
<P>
"According to the constitution, we have 30 days to review the
issue," Sharif told a meeting of the ruling Pakistan Muslim League
(PML-N) parliamentary party and its allies, according to Siddiqu
ul Farooq, press secretary of the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court of Pakistan Wednesday suspended the operation
of the 14th Amendment (the Anti-Defection Law) to the
constitution, which was passed by both houses of the parliament
unanimously in early July this year.
</P>
<P>
The amendment restrains members of the parliament from
breaching party discipline, code of conduct and declared policies.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court took the decision at the crucial moment when
the government and the judiciary are trying to resolve a
two-month-old tussle over the elevation of judges.
</P>
<P>
The National Assembly on Wednesday held a special session and
adopted a resolution reiterating supremacy of the parliament over
all other organs of the state and vowed to protect its
constitutional authority of amending the constitution.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Sharif said on Wednesday that the suspension of
the 14th Amendment, which was enacted in line with the aspirations
of the nation to root out the curse of horse-trading, has again
opened the way for "politics of money."
</P>
<P>
He called the suspension "unconstitutional," saying the
parliament would solve the issue by "playing its constitutional
role."

It was reported earlier that the bomb went off at Orchard

<HEADLINE> Somalia Fights Agaist Deforestation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, October 30 (xinhua)-- There are increasing
outcries by Somali intellectuals and local non-governmental
organizations over a serious deforestation continuing in the
rural lands since the collapse of the central administration for
Somalia in 1991.
</P>
<P>
According to Abdirahman Moallim Ahmed, the district
commissioner of Warshekh Town, about 100 kilometers northeast of
Mogadishu, the Somali businessmen are mainly to blame for the
danger of the deforestation.
</P>
<P>
Ahmed has told journalists that certain valuable trees and
wild animals commonly seen in the region are now in danger to
disappear.
</P>
<P>
Speaking about the vanishing trees, Ahmed said the trees of
raydab, maray and kulan are among the ones now rarely seen in the
area while the endangered species of animals are the dik-dik,
buck and deer.
</P>
<P>
A local environmental organization known as Hami has accused
Somali businessmen of exporting tens of thousands of tons of coal
to the United Arab Emirats and Saudi Arabia in the past month.
</P>
<P>
Hami has put the deforestation level at about 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
"The nomads chop age-old trees for use as faggots," said
Mohamed Muhidin Ali, the Secretary General of Hami, "the nomads
also shoot the wild animal for hunting and for fun," he added.
</P>
<P>
In their campaign against the deforestation and in their drive
for the conservation of the endangered species, Hami and the
local authorities of the coastal district of Warahekh called on
the Gulf countries to ban the trade of the Somali coal and the
endangered species exported by Somali businessmen who are
benefiting from the lawlessness in Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the estimated 1.5 million inhabitants of Mogadishu
have met with difficulties in buying coal for cooking.
</P>
<P>
The prices of coal and vegetables have sharply increased
between 100 percent and 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
The price of one quintal of coal has increased by 100 percent,
from 30,000 Somali Shillings to 60,000 (close to 8 U.S. Dollars)
in the main markets while the vegetables such as tomatoes,
potatoes, cabbage and onions have been scarce in the markets
following the rains that hindered the movement of vehicles in the
farm and coal lands.

<HEADLINE> Levy to Begin Washington Talks with PNA Monday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Foreign Minister
David Levy has been given a mandate by the government to begin
talks with the Palestinian side in Washington from next Monday,
Israel Radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
Levy was authorized to negotiate with Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) deputy head Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen) on interim
issues, further Israeli troop redeployments in West Bank as well
as the basis for holding the final-status talks.
</P>
<P>
The Levy-Mazen talks are to be hosted by United States
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. Levy will be joined by
Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh, his ministry's Director-General
Eitan Bentsur and heads of some of the interim committees.
</P>
<P>
The mandate to negotiate was given Wednesday by Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu after conducting marathon consultations with
his inner Cabinet ministers and senior aides to formulate
guidelines.
</P>
<P>
Levy had threatened to cancel the Washington trip to force
Netanyahu to give him clear mandate and guidelines for pushing
forward the peace talks, which were resumed early this month.
</P>
<P>
Late Wednesday, Levy informed United States Middle East peace
coordinator Dennis Ross of the the Cabinet decision to let him to
travel to Washington on Monday. He said he was authorized to
negotiate with the Palestinian side on issues related to the
further pullbacks and time-out of its settlement activities.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Radio reported today that Israel and PNA have been
holding secret talks recently to prepare for the incoming
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The secret meetings, attended by former Israeli Foreign
Ministry Director-General Uri Savir on the Israeli side, were
reportedly sponsored by Terje Larsen, a famous Norwegian diplomat
who served as former United Nations representative to the
Palestinian territories and helped seal the Oslo Accord.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Netanyahu's attorney Yitzhak Molcho has been keeping
contacts with Speaker of the Palestinian Legislative Council Ahmed
Queria (Abu Ala), on the issue of Israel's further pullouts.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the Molcho-Ala contact was set up during
the summit meeting held in early October between Netanyahu and PNA
President Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
The Levy-Mazen talks in Washington are expected to be tough in
view of great differences between the two sides over the
settlements, further redeployments and permanent talks. Israel is
proposing further delay in its redeployments in exchange for a
possible restriction on settlement activities, a request the PNA
has so far rejected.
</P>
<P>
Under the signed agreements, Israel should have completed, by
early September, the first and second phases of the three-stage
futher troop pullouts from West Bank. But they have never been
carried out due to Israeli-PNA dispute over the scope of
redeployments.
</P>
<P>
Senior Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said today that he
was fully mandated to advance the talks with Israel. But he
doubted if the talks would be productive since Israel was only
interested in negotiations for negotiation's sake.
</P>
<P>
Erekat added that Arafat was displeased with the past talks
that have failed to produce any results. "President Arafat wants
to revive the peace process through implementation of (what is) on
the ground," he told Israel Radio.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Appreciates Austria's Neutrality </HEADLINE>

<P>
MOSCOW, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Russia praised Austria's neutral
position on the problem of NATO, Russian President Boris Yeltsin
said today, when meeting with visiting Austrian Federal Chancellor
Victor Klima, according to the Itar-Tass news agency.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting with Klima held in the Kremlin Yeltsin said that
Russia and Austria have much in common and "they have similar
positions on many issues."
</P>
<P>
"Austria is a neutral state, including its attitude towards
NATO," he said, adding Russia praised Austria's neutrality.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting Klima told reporters that Austria called for
a European security policy which would not create new dividing
lines on the continent.
</P>
<P>
He said Vienna bases its policy in this field on two principles
-- neutrality and solidarity, which implies military participation
in crisis settlement in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Klima continued that the Austrian government is preparing a
report on developing the national policy on European security,
which provides for a wide range of opportunities from the
preservation of the status-quo up to various forms of "enforced
cooperation" including entering the alliance.
</P>
<P>
The chancellor stressed that Vienna respected the "independent
decision" by its neighbors to join NATO, adding that it would
take an "independent decision" of its own on further steps
concerning its role in the preservation of European security.
</P>
<P>
According to Klima, Yeltsin has accepted his invitation to
visit Austria in the second half of 1998.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Records Over 10,000 AIDS Cases Since 1982 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria has recorded more than
10,000 reported cases of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome
(AIDS) since the inception of the disease in 1982, said a senior
official of Nigeria's AIDS control program.
</P>
<P>
It is also estimated that more than four million Nigerians are
infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), said Derex
Briggs of the National AIDS and Secually Transmitted Diseases
Control Program (NASCP).
</P>
<P>
HIV is the causative agent of the dreaded and incurable AIDS,
she added, quoted by the News Agancy of Nigeria today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the bi-monthly continuing education program for
medical practitioners and health works on Wednesday, Briggs said
sero-sentinel surveys conducted so far in the country had shown
that the spread of the disease had been on the rise.
</P>
<P>
By the 1991-92 period, there was only about 1.5 percent
infection among the population but by the end of 1996, it had
increased to about 4.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The current population of Nigeria is estimated at about 100
million.
</P>
<P>
The surveys also showed that the distribution of the infection
among the patients recorded 70 percent in the married couples,
22.7 percent in single persons, 9.1 percent in divorcees, eight
percent in students and below one percent among clergymen.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, the prevalence rate through sexual
intercourse is 56.74 percent in males and 43.26 percent in
females, while 34 percent is in commercial sex workers.

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, October 30 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
government today rejected new state spending for job creation.
</P>
<P>
"There will be no public programs funded by taxpayers," said
Kohl's chief of staff, Friedrich Bohl, in a speech to parliament.
</P>
<P>
He added that Kohl will declare the government employment
policy on November 13.
</P>
<P>
Susanne Tietmann, a deputy from the ruling coalition, said
Kohl's center-right government hoped for job creation through tax
cuts, privatization and liberalization.
</P>
<P>
She also warned that employment policy could not simply be
handed over to the European Union, saying "The problems and the
solutions in (various EU countries) are just too different for
this."
</P>
<P>
EU leaders are to meet in Luxembourg on November 20-21 in fresh
efforts to reduce unemployment in EU, which now reached about 20
million.
</P>
<P>
The main opposition Social Democrats (SPD) demanded EU
agreement on increased state spending to cut unemployment and
warned that the ongoing economic upswing and deregulation would
fail to create enough new jobs in Germany.
</P>
<P>
"We know that economic growth will not be enough, we need a new
path," said SPD deputy Guenter Glosser.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the Kohl government should allow the
coordination of EU unemployment and economic policies from
Brussels and fight low wages and Union tax havens.

<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot President Glafcos
Clerides said here today that the European Union (EU) had
supported his proposal for the demilitarization of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on his return from Edinburgh, Britain, where he
attended the Commonwealth Summit, Clerides said he believed the
EU has realized that his proposal for the demilitarization of
Cyprus provides the right framework for achieving complete
disarmament.
</P>
<P>
Referring to next month's visit to Cyprus by
U.N. Secretary-General's Cyprus envoy Diego Cordovez, Clerides
said the main purpose of his visit is to see for himself the
situation on the ground and establish whether both sides are
ready to enter an open-ended dialogue after the presidential
elections scheduled for February next year.
</P>
<P>
Cordovez has announced his plan to make a fact-finding trip
to the region in mid-November, which will also take him to
Ankara, Athens, London and perhaps Brussels.
</P>
<P>
Clerides also said he is ready to meet Turkish Cypriot leader
Rauf Denktash to discuss security issues.
</P>
<P>
Clerides and Denktash has had one meeting in Nicosia on
security issues, but it did not yield any results as Denktash
reportedly rejected the idea of a discussion on all security
issues which the Greek Cypriot side considers necessary.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus problem has remained unsolved since 1974 when the
island was divided after Turkish troops invaded and took over
the northern third following a short-lived coup by Greek
Cypriots seeking union with Greece.

<P>
LAGOS, October 30 (Xinhua) -- President Alpha Oumar Konare of
Mali arrived in the Nigerian capital of Abuja today on a one-day
official visit, to exchange views on regional situation, the News
Agency of Nigeria reported.
</P>
<P>
Konare was met at the Abuja international airport by Nigerian
head of state, General Sani Abacha, and other top government
officials.
</P>
<P>
The aim of this unannounced visit has not yet been disclosed
but the official news agency said the two heads of state held
bilateral talks in the presidency.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria and Mali, both are members of the Economic Community
of West African States (ECOWAS), have enjoyed good relations.
</P>
<P>
However, observers noted that Mali had different view with
Nigeria, which holds ECOWAS chairmanship, in how to solve the
Sierra Leonean crisis, triggered off by the May 25 coup that
toppled the legitimate government.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria proposed the use of force to oust the junta in case
the ECOWAS-advocated dialogue and economic sanction failed to
persuade the coupists to step down.
</P>
<P>
Mali was among the ECOWAS members that did not agree to the
use of force.
Konare is expected to return home later in the day.

<HEADLINE> Tourist Killers Prove Sane: Egyptian Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 30 (Xinhua) -- An Egyptian military court today
condemned to death the two brothers who carried out a fatal attack
on tourists in downtown Cairo last month and said it had proved
the sanity of them.
</P>
<P>
The court said it reached its verdict after being "completely
certain of the sanity of both of them," the Middle East News
Agency (MENA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Saber Mohamed Farahat, a madhouse inmate, and his younger
brother Mahmoud Mohamed Farahat, were sentenced to death by the
court today on conviction of killing nine German tourists and an
Egyptian driver in a shooting and firebomb attack outside the
Egyptian Museum on September 18.
</P>
<P>
The counsel for the defense had asked earlier for the release
of Saber on claims that he was mentally ill and should not be held
responsible for his actions.
</P>
<P>
Saber was confined to Cairo's Khanka Asylum when he had been
proved insane after killing three foreigners at a hotel in the
capital in 1993 and escaped just three days before the latest
attack.
</P>
<P>
The claims were overruled by the court after medical
examinations, made following the assault, showed that Saber was
sane beyond any doubt, MENA said.
</P>
<P>
Saber, charged with premeditated murder and other counts
together with his brother, denied that he was insane, saying he
was to avenge blasphemous drawings posted by an Israeli woman on
storefronts in West Bank months ago.
</P>
<P>
After the verdict was read out, the two brothers fell to their
knees yelling "God is great" and thanking their judge to the
surprise of the crowd present at the trial.
</P>
<P>
The chief justice accused the brothers of carrying out "henious
crime under the guise of Islam," adding that the community should
purify itself from such evil persons to be able to live in peace.
</P>
<P>
He said that Saber was "the devil incarnate," and that hanging
him and his brother was "the least thing that can be done to
punish them" for the crime.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian authorities have maintained the attack was not
linked to Islamic militants, who have been fighting the secular
government since 1992, and described it as an isolated case.

<HEADLINE> China Attaches Importance to Issue of Population, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 30 (Xinhua) -- China had attached great
importance to the issue of population and development, Chinese
delegate Yu Qingtai said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the fifty-second session of the General Assembly,
Yu Qingtai said as the most populous nation in the world, China
had long faced the challenges of population and development, and
fully understood its responsibility in the area.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese delegate said taking into account the situation in
China, particularly the specific conditions of the broad rural
regions, China had continued to place the emphasis on providing
family planning and reproductive health services in the rural
areas, and had endeavored to closely combine the the provision of
these services with efforts to eradicate poverty.
</P>
<P>
Yu said government institutions at all levels had assisted the
broad masses of peasants to embark on the road to developing
production, eradicate poverty and attaining prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Yu said with these efforts, successes had been achieved to
break the vicious circle of "poverty -- population overgrowth --
more serious poverty", a circle that had obstructed development in
many rural areas in China.
</P>
<P>
Yu said since the United Nations Conference on Population and
Development, all countries has done a great deal to implement the
"Plan of Action". There had been successful experiences as well as
lessons from the lack of success.
</P>
<P>
Yu stressed the international community should timely sum up
the experiences, with particular focus on identifying shortcomings,
with a view to formulating specific measures for strengthening
international cooperation in the implementation of the "Plan of
Action".

<HEADLINE> Minister Denies Remarks on Abacha's Candidature </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 30 (Xinhua) -- The chief press secretary to the
Nigerian information and culture minister has announced the
minister did not say that the head of state General Sani Abacha
could not contest the presidential election next year.
</P>
<P>
Minister Walter Ofonagoro reportedly denied last Saturday
Abacha's candidature of presidency for the fact that he is not a
registered member of any political parties in the country.
</P>
<P>
"The mind of the head of state at the moment is not in the
presidency of the fourth republic. It is people who are trying to
drag him in," the minister was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, in a letter to the News Agency of Nigeria today, the
chief press secretary, Dan Iwunze, said that the minister in an
answer to reporters' questions asked a rhetorical question:
</P>
<P>
"Why do we waste time discussing whether the head of state
will run or not, instead of concentrating on elections at hand.
Does the head of state belongs to any party?"
</P>
<P>
The publication of the letter coincided with the disagreement
of Special Duties Minister Elder Wole Oyelese, who reportedly
said on Wednesday that Abacha "is free to join any party at
any time".
</P>
<P>
According to the military government's three-year transition
program, presidential election will be held next year, with the
elected government put in place on October 1.
</P>
<P>
It has much talked about in and outside Nigeria whether Abacha
should quit the military and participate in the election.
</P>
<P>
Abacha himself has said earlier it is a matter that one should
think about and will depend on the will of his constituency.

<HEADLINE> Constitutional Amendment Bill Passed in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan Parliament of the
National Assembly today passed the Constitutional Amendment Bill
with 156 Members of Parliament voting for the Bill and 26
against.
</P>
<P>
Under the Kenya Constitution, the Bill must be supported by a
two-thirds majority of the MPs to get passed, which requires at
least 133 votes in favor.
</P>
<P>
There are 122 MPs from the ruling Kenya African National Union
(KANU) including President Daniel arap Moi who is free to
contribute to debate, answer questions and vote in parliament
under law and the Standing Orders.
</P>
<P>
President Moi today did not participate in the voting as
expected by the local media nor has he voted on any law during
his 19-year tenure as President.
</P>
<P>
The debate on the Bill lasted two weeks after the Kenyan
government withdrew an earlier attempt to shorten it.
</P>
<P>
Before today's session, some MPs from opposition parties
demanded that President Moi first give assent to the Statute Law
(Repeals and Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill which was enacted
last week.
</P>
<P>
The 13-member Inter-Party Parliamentary Group (IPPG) Committee
Wednesday held a meeting attended by the Attorney General Amos
Wako, which was aimed at solving the differences between the
ruling KANU and the Opposition.
</P>
<P>
Wako was reported to explain at the meeting that the Statutes
Bill could not be signed by the president to become law on its
own because that could cause a constitutional crisis.
</P>
<P>
He told the meeting that President Moi would give assent to
the entire IPPG reforms Bills once they were passed through all
stages by the Parliament.

</P>
<P>
"Historically speaking, it was President Nixon who opened the
door to China-U.S. relations 25 years ago and it was President
Carter who normalized our relations 18 years ago, and these
historic decisions were supported by both the Democratic Party and
the Republican Party," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He said he is glad to see more than 100 U.S. congressmen
including Speaker Newt Gingrich and Senator Thurmond visit China
in a year and more. The visiting congressmen witnessed the social

and development, he said.
</P>
<P>
"I'm optimistic about the future of the China-U.S. ties," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Major Events of Kenya's Constitutional Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 30 (Xinhua) -- The following are major events
on the long journey to the constitutional reforms in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Soon after independence in 1963, Kenya amended the neo-liberal
constitution with its focus on the presidency and its
bureaucratic powers, privileges and prerogatives similar to those
enjoyed by feudal monarchs were unfettered following the
amendment.
</P>
<P>
In 1991, Section 2A of the Kenya Constitution was repealed,
terminating the legal monopoly of political power by the ruling
Kenya African National Union (KANU) and introducing a multi-party
system into the east African country.
</P>
<P>
However, the legal, institutional and administrative
structures of the Constitution were not affected and a vast array
of repressive colonial laws gave the Civil Service broad
discretionary powers which were used to severely restrict the
freedoms of association, expression and assembly.
</P>
<P>
The issue of constitutional reforms and creation of sound
legal framework for multi-party democracy and free and fair
elections had been raised by some opposition politicians prior to
the 1992 General Elections.
</P>
<P>
The main opposition parties in the country decided to win the
1992 elections first and then change the Constitution once they
got to the State House.
</P>
<P>
The issue of constitutional, legal and administrative reforms
came to the fore again after the opposition lost elections in
1992.
</P>
<P>
During the period between 1993 and 1995, constitutional
reforms had taken a back seat and was only addressed by
individual politicians on an ad hoc basis as various opposition
parties were caught in an intense leadership struggle.
</P>
<P>
The most important initiative during this time was that the
Law Society of Kenya, International Commission of Jurists Kenya
Section and the Kenya Human Rights Commission launched a joint
venture of the Citizens' Coalition for Constitutional Change
(4Cs).
</P>
<P>
The 4Cs did a lot to clarify the content of minimum
constitutional reforms to facilitate the holding of free and fair
elections, and developed a model constitution.
</P>
<P>
By mid-1994, meetings were held to discuss ways and means of
fielding a single opposition presidential candidate and creating
a level electoral playing field through constitutional and legal
reforms.
</P>
<P>
At a two-day workshop organized in September 1995, it was
agreed that an all-inclusive Opposition Alliance be formed to
fight for constitutional reforms.
</P>
<P>
In mid-October 1995, a joint opposition secretariat was set up
to facilitate dialogue with civil society to define minimum
constitutional and legal reforms necessary for free and fair
elections.
</P>
<P>
In November 1995, opposition parties launched the National
Alliance which was mandated to discuss the minimum
constitutional, legal and administrative reforms.
</P>
<P>
In early 1996, for the first time in Kenya's history, the
entire religious, civil society and the opposition political
parties came together to discuss constitutional reforms and to
plan a National Convention.
</P>
<P>
In May 1996, the religious sector, civil society and
opposition parties formed an ad hoc National Convention Planning
Committee (NCPC).

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Through its management and
technical committees, the NCPC clarified the process of
constitutional reforms and reached a consensus on minimum
constitutional, legal and administrative reforms.
</P>
<P>
Between April 4 and 6, 1997, the NCPC organized a National
Convention Assembly (NCA) which agreed on constitutional reforms
and practical measures to pressurize the government to implement
the minimum reform package.
</P>
<P>
The NCA mandated NCPC which was renamed National Convention
Executive Council (NCEC) to be its executive arm to implement
these measures.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ruling KANU repeatedly ruled out any
constitutional reforms before the General Elections to be held
later this year, saying that a review of the Kenya Constitution
is a very serious business which requires a lot of time which is
not available before the General Elections.
</P>
<P>
The NCEC organized a series of mass meetings without licenses
on May 3, May 31, June 19 and July 7 which met with violent
suppression on the part of the government.
</P>
<P>
Following the Saba Saba (July 7) incident in which 13 people
were killed, Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi invited leaders of
the religious community to State House in Nairobi and indicated
that he was willing to discuss constitutional reforms.
</P>
<P>
Moi later met the leader of the Official Opposition Parties,
Wamalwa Kiana Wamalwa who was mandated to arrange a meeting
between the president and leaders of the parliamentary opposition
parties.
</P>
<P>
The NCEC forwarded its minimum reform package to Moi through
the Head of the Civil Service in August 1997.
</P>
<P>
As the NCEC was planning a strike on August 8, the religious
community formed a Religious Community Mediation Team (RCMT) and
obtained the consent of KANU and NCEC to act as their mediators.
</P>
<P>
On August 25, 1997, the RCMT was scheduled to launch the
negotiation talks, but the KANU boycotted it, insisting that KANU
did not recognize the NCEC.
</P>
<P>
At the conference held between August 26 and 28, 1997, the NCA
resolved that any negotiations on constitutional reforms had to
be through NCEC and advocated more intensified mass actions to
force KANU to negotiate with it.
</P>
<P>
In early August 1997, a group of KANU Members of Parliament
led by Jilo Falana held a meeting and studied the NCEC reform
documents.
</P>
<P>
On August 27, 1997, a coffee session was held between
reformist KANU and Opposition MPs and an agreement was reached to
organize a meeting of all KANU and Opposition MPs to discuss the
immediate future of the country.
</P>
<P>
On August 28, 1997, some 130 Members of Parliament from both
the ruling KANU and opposition parties set up an Inter-Party
Parliamentary Group (IPPG) and formed a 13-member committee to
spearhead the constitutional reform talks.
</P>
<P>
The IPPG used the two Bills drafted by the Attorney-General
Amos Wako, the Constitution Review Commission Bill and the
Statute Law Bill, and the NCEC documents on minimum
constitutional, legal and administrative reforms as the working
documents.
</P>
<P>
The Statute Law Bill based on the IPPG recommendation was
endorsed last week and the Constitutional Amendment Bill
recommended by the IPPG was passed today with 156 MPs voting for
the Bill.

<HEADLINE> Legitimate Rights of Immigrants Should be Respected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 30 (Xinhua) -- In addressing issues
related to the international migration, it was essential to
respect the legitimate rights of the immigrates, Chinese delegate
Yu Qingtai said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the fifty-second session of the General Assembly,
Yu Qingtai said in the process of global integration, and as a
result of increasing interaction between countries, the scale of
international migration was also continuing to expand.
</P>
<P>
Yu said this had become a multi-facet issue that involved
political, economic, social, legal, ethnic, as well as cultural
dimensions. It was related to the sovereignty and interests of the
states involved, and at the same time had direct impacts on the
interests of the migrants.
</P>
<P>
Yu said it was natural that this issue should receive serious
attention from the international community. In addressing the
issues related to the international migration, the sovereignty of
the countries of destination should be respected, including their
regulatory rights on the entry of migrants.
</P>
<P>
Yu said but it was also essential to respect the legitimate
rights of the immigrants, to ensure that they were not
discriminated against, or be subjected to racism and xenophobia.
</P>
<P>
Yu said that the international community should continue to
explore the ways to strengthen cooperation in this field. it was
necessary to reach consensus on certain principles through an
appropriate international forum, with a view to establish some
guidelines that all countries should abide by when addressing the
issue of international migration.

directly and indirectly involved in the development of
agriculture need data and information on the sector.
</P>
<P>
The type of agricultural data needed by various agencies and
institutions are many in number and different in nature, he said,
adding that the existing types of agricultural information made
available by relevant agencies are too few in number and limited
in scope.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of such a system means to implement the
national agricultural development strategy and achieve its
principal objectives, Seifu noted.
</P>
<P>
The workshop, aimed at creating a forum for agricultural
information producers and users to share experiences, is
organized by the Ministry of Agriculture in collaboration with
the United Nations Development Program (UNDP).

<HEADLINE> PNA, Hamas Hold Secret Talks to Stop Terrorist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) and the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) have
been engaged in secret negotiations that would lead to a
temporary halt in terrorist attacks, Israel Radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted a source in Jerusalem as saying that in
return the PNA will release Hamas prisoners held in its jails
and allow institutions affiliated with the organization to
reopen.
</P>
<P>
PNA President Yasser Arafat is reportedly considering
to reopen 16 Hamas institutions, which he closed down last
month under pressure from Israel and the United States.
</P>
<P>
The source said that the PNA is also taking certain steps
to fight terrorism, adding that these efforts will enable
Arafat to gain concessions from Israel in the future peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
As a new development in the Israeli- Palestinian peace
process, PNA deputy Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen) is due to begin
negotiations with Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy in
Washington next Monday, which are expected to focus on the
further withdrawal of Israeli troops from the West Bank and the
"time out" in Israeli settlement activity.
</P>
<P>
Hamas has taken a tough stance since its spiritual leader
Sheikh Ahmed Yassin returned to Gaza early this month as a deal
between Jordan and Israel, which was reached after the Mossad's
(Israeli intelligency agency) attempted assassination of a Hamas
political leader in Amman.
</P>
<P>
Last Wednesday, Yassin called for a holy war against Israel
until Palestinians "return to their land" and get their just
rights and another Hamas leader Abdul Aziz Rantisi called for
more suicide bombing attacks in Israeli cities.
</P>
<P>
Their remarks drew harsh reactions from the Israeli
government. Bar-Ilan, political adviser of Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu, said that the most shocking aspect of Yassin
speech is that it took place with the tacit approval of the
PNA.

<HEADLINE> Current Situation in China Very Good: Jiang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese President
Jiang Zemin said here today that the current situation in China is
very good as demonstrated by the rapid growth of the national
economy.
</P>
<P>
Jiang briefed his U.S. audience on China's domestic situation
at a luncheon jointly hosted by the America-China Society, the
National Committee on U.S.-China Relations, the U.S.-China Policy
Foundation, the Council on Foreign Relations, the Asia Society and
the Committee of 100.
</P>
<P>
China's gross domestic product is expected to grow by nine
percent this year while inflation has been brought under effective
control, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"China is now opening wider to the outside world and, as
investment environment continues to improve, the number of
overseas investors has already exceeded 290,000," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The total amount of foreign capital actually used by China has
topped 200 billion U.S. dollars, making China the second largest
country in attracting overseas investment, he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, China enjoys social stability with all-round
progress in its social undertakings, the Chinese president said.
</P>
<P>
Looking back on China's developing path, Jiang said that the
one hundred years between the middle of the 19th century and
middle of the this century began with the Chinese people suffering
from humiliation and ended with their achieving national
independence and liberation.
</P>
<P>
"The one hundred years from the middle of this century to the
middle of the next century began with the birth of New China and
will end, as we will see, with the Chinese people succeeding,
through hard work, in building a strong and prosperous country and
securing a happy life for themselves," he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Zemin is on a nine-day tour of the United States starting
from Sunday, the first state visit to the United States by a
Chinese head of state in 12 years.

<P>
CAIRO, October 30 (Xinhua) -- The following are business briefs
from Middle East countries:
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- Oil traders can expect business as usual next
month at the OPEC meeting in Jakarta, with a likely roll-over of
its members production quotas, the group's president said.
</P>
<P>
"I don't expect there will be an increase in Jakarta. I believe
they will roll over again," said Abdullah bin Hamad al Attiyah,
president of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
</P>
<P>
"I expect a very ordinary meeting," the president who is also
Qatar's Oil Minister said of the Jakarta OPEC session, scheduled
on November 26.
</P>
<P>
The group meets twice a year in order to review its own
policies and assess the global oil supply-demand balance.
</P>
<P>
The current OPEC oil output ceiling was set in September 1993
with the exception of Iraq's. It stands at 25.03 million barrels
per day (bpd) and remained unchanged for four years.
</P>
<P>
However, OPEC's reports showed that the actual crude output of
the group now is running nearly 2 million bpd in excess of the
ceiling because many members are known to have been exceeding
their quotas.
</P>
<P>
This have greatly damaged crude prices which currently hover
between 18 and 19 dollars a barrel, sharply dropping from 25
dollars in late 1996.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- Lebanon offers a new 10-year 400 million U.S. dollars
Eurobond issue that will be placed at the disposal of the Lebanese
Treasury Friday at 10 am New York time, Lebanese newspaper
reported today.
</P>
<P>
It represents the fifth issue of bonds by the Lebanese
government since 1994.
</P>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY -- A new polypropylene plant with an annual
production capacity of 100,000 tonnes has come into operation in
Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Director of the plant Abdellah Al-Marzouk said the
polypropylene products would be put on the local and international
market soon.
</P>
<P>
Polypropylene is a plastic substance used in manufacturing car
chassis, carpets, threads, some sophisticated medical equipment
and toys among other things.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Confident of Success of Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese President
Jiang Zemin said here today that China will work to establish a
fairly ideal socialist market economy between now and 2010.
</P>
<P>
Delivering a speech at a luncheon hosted by the America-China
Society and five other organizations, Jiang said that keeping
public ownership in the dominant position while allowing diverse
forms of ownership to develop is a basic economic system to which
China must always adhere in the primary stage of socialism.
</P>
<P>
"Public ownership can take diversified forms, and all
management methods and organizational styles that embody the laws
of socialized production, such as the joint stock system and the
joint stock partership, should be utilized without hesitation," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"The non-public sector is an important component of our
socialist market economy, and we should continue to encourage and
guide their sound development."
</P>
<P>
On the reform of state-owned enterprises (SOE), Jiang said that
along the line of establishing a modern enterprise system, the
Chinese government will accelerate the reform, giving greater play
to SOE's dominant role in the national economy and quickening the
market-oriented reform of the national economy.
</P>
<P>
He said China will continue to readjust and optimize the
economic structure and stick to the strategies of revitalizing the
nation through science and education and sustainable development.
</P>
<P>
"We will further improve our pattern of openness which is
all-directional, multi-leveled and wide-ranging, develop an open
economy and open China still wider to the outside world," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president said the establishment of the socialist
market economy and a rapid and sound development of China's
economy will lay a solid foundation for basic achievement of
modernization by the middle of the next century.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Algeria Opposition Stages Anti-government Protest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALGIERS, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Algerian opposition and
government-allied parties organized a protest here today against
what they termed as "overall fraud" of last week's local
elections.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of supporters of six parties including the National
Liberation Front, which backs the government, marched in front of
Algeria's main state organs, carrying posters and shouting slogans
against the results of the local elections.
</P>
<P>
Today's march, not approved by the authorities, was aimed at
exerting pressure on the government to discard the results of the
local elections.
</P>
<P>
The march was the largest anti-government gathering launched by
opposition parties since 1992 when the military-backed regime
canceled the legislative elections expected to be won by the
Islamic Salvation Front.
</P>
<P>
As early as Monday, the National Liberation Front supporters
staged a protest, accusing the government of winning the elections
by fraud.
</P>
<P>
The ruling National Democratic Rally and its two coalition
partners, the National Liberation Front and the Muslim Society
Movement, won most of the seats of the municipal and provincial
councils in the elections held on October 23.

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, October 30 (Xinhua) -- German Defense Minister Volker
Ruehe today called for stricter background checks on recruits in
order to bar neo-Nazis from German troops.
</P>
<P>
He made the appeal in a speech to parliament in response to the
discovery of a second neo-Nazi film made by German armed forces,
the Bundeswehr.
</P>
<P>
Ruehe asked for the aid of justice officials so that conscripts
could be better screened and those with criminal records could be
barred from military service.
</P>
<P>
"It is irresponsible that (far-right) recruits are trained to
use weapons in the armed forces," he said.
</P>
<P>
Last week the Defense Ministry said it discovered a second
neo-Nazi home video made by members of an eastern German mountain
infantry battalion.
</P>
<P>
The video depicted staged beatings, troops giving the Hitler
salute and anti-Semitic statements.
</P>
<P>
A video found earlier this year from the same battalion
included simulated executions and rapes by soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Ruehe stressed that there would always be a few "black sheep"
anywhere and that the Bundeswehr was in no way dominated by the
far-right.

WASHINGTON, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang
Zemin said here today that the basic goal of China's foreign
policy is to maintain and promote world peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
Delivering a speech at a luncheon hosted by the America-China
Society and five other organizations, Jiang said China is, and
will always be, a staunch force working for the maintenance of
world peace.
</P>
<P>
"China's defense policy is of a defensive nature and our
military spending is the lowest among major countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the unilateral troop reduction by one million
men in the eighties, China has recently announced that it will cut
back its military force by another 500,000 men in the next three
years, he said.
</P>
<P>
As China becomes more and more developed with its people
leading a better life, he said, it can only promote world peace
and stability rather than pose a threat to anyone.
</P>
<P>
"China will never seek hegemony even after it becomes a
developed country in the future," Jiang said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President On China-U.S. Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese President
Jiang Zemin today emphasized the five guidelines for the
development of China-U.S. ties oriented toward the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Delivering a speech at a luncheon hosted by the America-China
Society and five other organizations, Jiang said the first
guideline is to view and handle China-U.S. relations from a
strategic and long-term perspective and keep a firm grip on the
overall interest of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
The second one is to vigorously seek the converging point of
the common interests, taking into account not only one's own
interest but also that of the other side, he said.
</P>
<P>
The third is to strictly abide by the three China-U.S. joint
communiques which form the basis of a growing relationship, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The fourth is to handle the differences through consultation on
an equal footing in the spirit of mutual respect and seeking
common ground while putting aside differences. The fifth is to
handle the Taiwan issue properly.
</P>
<P>
"A review of the past tells us that further progress in
China-U.S. relations hinges on correctly understanding our common
interests and proper handling our differences," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government has reiterated on many occasions its
commitment to the "one China" policy and the three joint
communiques, he said.
</P>
<P>
When China and the United States moved to establish diplomatic
relations, the U.S. government made a farsighted decision to sever
so-called diplomatic ties with Taiwan, withdraw American troops
from there and abrogate the treaties it had signed with the
regime, he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang stressed that the question of Taiwan has always been the
most important and most sensitive issue at the heart of
China-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
"Whenever trouble crops up there, the relationship will
stagnate or even suffer setbacks," he said. Unlike Hong Kong and
Macao, Taiwan is an issue left over from the struggle between the
Chinese Communist Party and the Kuomintang.
</P>
<P>
The solution to the Taiwan issue is entirely an internal affair
of China and should be worked out by the Chinese people on both
sides of the Straits, he added.
</P>
<P>
The basic policy of the Chinese government for the settlement
of the Taiwan question is "peaceful reunification based on one
country, two systems", he noted.
</P>
<P>
Jiang is on a nine-day tour in the United States, the first
visit by a Chinese head of state in 12 years.
</P>
<P>
China and the United States Wednesday issued a joint statement
which called for building a constructive, strategic partnership
between the two countries oriented toward the 21st century.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President On Human Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese President
Jiang Zemin said here today that different views held by countries
on the human rights issue ought to be addressed through dialogues
and confrontation should be avoided.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the remarks at a luncheon hosted by the
America-China Society and five other organizations.
</P>
<P>
"China is ready to keep up exchanges and cooperation with other
countries in a continued effort to promote human rights throughout
the world," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He said China has acceded to 17 international human rights
instruments and has recently signed the International Covenant on
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government takes upon itself the task to protect
human rights according to law and opposes all activities of
violating the lawful rights of its citizens," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
As a developing country of 1.2 billion people, he said, China's
very reality determines that the right to subsistence and
development is the most fundamental and most important human right
in China.
</P>
<P>
He told his audience that during the past 20 years or so, the
number of people living below the poverty line in China has
dropped by nearly 200 million, providing a necessary material
condition for better enjoyment of rights by the people.
</P>
<P>
"Human rights as enjoyed by the Chinese people today have never
been as extensive," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has also always endeavored to protect
the rights and interests of ethnic minorities in accordance with
the Constitution, he said.
</P>
<P>
Regional autonomy is practiced in places where ethnic
minorities live in compact communities and all ethnic groups are
free to use and develop their own spoken and written languages as
well as to keep and reform their own customs, he said. Chinese
citizens also have the freedom of religious belief.
</P>
<P>
Jiang noted that the establishment and development of the
socialist system in China has enabled some ethnic groups to leap
over certain stages of social development.
</P>
<P>
"For example, until the democratic reform of 1959, Tibet was a
feudal-serfdom, a theocracy with a heavy tint of slavery," he
said. The serfs had no human rights whatsoever to speak of.
</P>
<P>
"It was our democratic reform that emancipated some one million
serfs and slaves through peaceful means," he said.
</P>
<P>
This, similar to the liberation of black slaves in American
history, represented a great social change and advance, he said.
</P>
<P>
With the support of the central government and the rest of the
country, today's Tibet is developing prosperously and people there
are living and working in happiness and contentment, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 30 (Xinhua) -- The overall goal of China's
political restructuring is to build socialist democracy with
Chinese characteristics, visiting Chinese President Jiang Zemin
said here today.
</P>
<P>
Giving a speech at a luncheon hosted by the American-China
Society and five other organizations, Jiang said, "We will further
enlarge democracy, run the state according to law and turn China
into a socialist country ruled by law."
</P>
<P>
"We believe that without democracy there can be no
modernization," he said.
</P>
<P>
As early as over 2,000 years ago, ancient Chinese came up with
such plain ideas of democracy and the rule of law as "people being
essential to a state while their governance following prescribed
laws", he said. "Today, these thoughts have been further developed
to reflect the new times.
</P>
<P>
"We will ensure that our people hold democratic elections, make
policy decisions democratically, carry out democratic management
and supervision, and enjoy extensive rights and freedoms under the
law while giving greater play to their creativity and their sense
of being the masters of state affairs," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He said China will continue to safeguard the dignity of the
Constitution and other laws, further improve the legal system,
strengthen supervision on government organs and leading officials
at all levels to ensure that all work of the country is carried
out according to law.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president also stressed the need to build a
national, scientific and popular socialist culture that is geared
to modernization, the world and the future.
</P>
<P>
"At the same time, we should conduct multi-formed cultural
exchanges with other countries, drawing on their strong points
while introducing our own achievements to the world, he said.

<HEADLINE> Sunglasses Donated to South Pole Explorers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 31 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese South Pole
Exploration party today received a donation of protective
sunglasses worth 1.2 million yuan (145,000 US dollars) from a
Sino-French optical company in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai Essilor Optical Co. Ltd. will make for each of the
150 members in the group a special pair of glasses which can block
out ultra-violet rays that can cause severe eye damage.
</P>
<P>
Other explorers who go to the South Pole within this century
will also get free glasses from the company.
</P>
<P>
The expedition members, who had been to the south pole before,
must undergo a long period of medical treatment after each trip to
restore their eyesight, which is most often harmed by the sun's
intense rays at the South Pole.
</P>
<P>
Experts said the donated glasses, which are more effective than
other models, may protect the explorers' eyes completely from sun
damage.
</P>
<P>
The expedition is scheduled to leave for the South Pole in
November.

MOSCOW, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
reiterated today the Russian central government's determination to
maintain a united nation.
</P>
<P>
The central government will further advance the course of the
country's federalization and is committed to protecting the rights
of its citizens from being encroached upon by local authorities,
said Yeltsin in a weekly radio address.
</P>
<P>
The president criticized some local governments for seeking
political and economic separation from the central government,
while praising those which reject nationalism and separatism.
</P>
<P>
Russian citizens are not indifferent to the decision on whether
they will live in a strong united country or a waning divided
country, stressed Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
They have often complained about the excessive political and
economic freedom enjoyed by some regions and the unauthorized
creation of local blocks, said Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
The central government will set about changing the confusing
situation, while enhancing local autonomy within the united
federation, said Yeltsin.

<P>
MOSCOW, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
is confident that his impending meeting with Japanese Prime
Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto will "start the beginning of a new
friendship," the Itar-Tass news agency said.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin made the remark today on his arrival at the
Krasnoyarsk airport.
</P>
<P>
He will meet with Hashimoto for two days on November 1-2. This
is the first such meeting in the history of Russian-Japanese
relations.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was initiated by the Japanese prime minister,
Yeltsin said. But the meeting's venue was decided by Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
The Russian president said that "I chose Krasnoyarsk as a kind
of Russian center, a point halfway between Moscow and Tokyo."
</P>
<P>
The place reflects Russia as "a vast, powerful country, full of
energy and resources," Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
On creating the strategic partnership between Russia and Japan
facing the 21st century, Yeltsin said that "politicians do not

<HEADLINE> Building Law Expected to End Chaos In Construction Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 31 (Xinhua) -- The Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress has been deliberating the draft law on
construction and is expected to pass the law before the current
session ends tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
Many committee members agreed the promulgation of the law is
urgently needed, as poor quality has hurt the building industry
and aroused public resentment, while the country is experiencing a
building boom unparalleled in history.
</P>
<P>
They noted that corruption, including bribery, and
irregularities in construction bidding and contracting,
constitutes the root-cause for sub-par construction quality that
has resulted in the collapsing of buildings.
</P>
<P>
Li Hao said the draft law should standardize in explicit terms
the practice in opening a bidding or a contract for a construction
project, a process which is prone to bribery.
</P>
<P>
Yang Zhongshu said that contractors and subcontractors tend to
make profits by subcontracting their projects to lower-level
construction firms without properly assessing their professional
skills.
</P>
<P>
There are too many building companies now, Yang said, and quite
a number of them hire workers without proper training and often
gain contracts by illegal means. He proposed biddings be conducted
openly and fairly and the draft law have strict definitions
regarding certifying building companies.
</P>
<P>
It should also put more stress on legal responsibility of the
personnel in charge of building designing, construction, building
materials and quality supervision, Yang said.
</P>
<P>
Many members pointed out that soon after the draft law is
implemented, harsher penalties and punishments should be meted out
to violators as a way to bring order to the somewhat chaotic
building market.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Foreign Trade Minister Meets Japanese Visitors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Trade Minister
Wu Yi said here today that Sino-Japanese economic and trade
relations have developed well since the normalization of
diplomatic ties 25 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Wu, minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation, was
speaking to a delegation from the Japan-China Economic Association
(JCEA), which was jointly headed by its honorary president
Shoichiro Toyota and president Watari Sugichiro.
</P>
<P>
She told the Japanese visitors that bilateral trade volume
exceeded 60 billion US dollars last year, and that Japan has
ranked as China' largest trade partner for the past four
years. Bilateral trade has further expanded this year.
</P>
<P>
Wu noted that trade volume between the two countries accounts
for one fifth of China's total foreign trade, and that the
Japanese enterprises have so far established 15,000 joint ventures
in China.
</P>
<P>
The smooth development of bilateral economic and trade
relations is tied to the efforts of the Japan-China Economic
Association -- something the Chinese side appreciates, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
Wu said she hopes that JCEA will continue to play a positive
role in furthering bilateral economic and trade relations.
</P>
<P>
Also, she said that China will continue to carry out its reform
and open policy.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has reduced its tariffs several times in
recent years, in a move to introduce more advanced technology and
quality equipment from abroad, she noted, saying that China
remains an attractive place for foreign investment, and that the
Chinese government is planning to grant more preferential policies
in order to bring in more foreign funds.
</P>
<P>
JCEA President Watari Sugichiro said that the achievements in
economic and trade cooperation between the two countries are
closely related to China's reform and open policy over the past 20
years.
</P>
<P>
He said he hopes that China will join the World Trade
Organization at an early date, thus enabling the two countries to
explore new ways for bilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He said that his association will continue to work for the
further development of Japanese-Chinese economic and trade
cooperation.

<HEADLINE> CPPCC Chairman Celebrates King Sihanouk's 75th Birthday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Li Ruihuan, chairman of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC)
National Committee, met here today with Cambodian King Norodom
Sihanouk, who is in Beijing for a regular medical examination.
</P>
<P>
The king was accompanied by his wife, Queen Norodom Monineath
Sihanouk
</P>
<P>
Li said he was pleased to meet the royal couple and
congratulated the king on his 75th birthday.
</P>
<P>
He also conveyed greetings from Chinese President Jiang Zemin
and Premier Li Peng to the king and the queen.
</P>
<P>
King Sihanouk is respected and beloved by the Cambodian people
and enjoys a high prestige in the international community, Li
said, adding that the king has dedicated himself to Cambodia's
national independence, sovereignty, peace and the people's
happiness.
</P>
<P>
The king is "an old and good friend" of the Chinese people, who
has contributed greatly to the growth of Sino-Cambodian
traditional friendship, Li noted, citing that the king had a close
relationship with the late Chinese leaders Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai
and Deng Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
The third generation of the Chinese leadership with Jiang Zemin
at the core would continue to advance Sino-Cambodian friendship,
Li added.
</P>
<P>
China, as a friendly neighbor of Cambodia, is very much
concerned about the current situation there, Li said. China hopes
that the parties involved in the disturbance in Cambodia would be
inspired by the spirit of the national reconciliation advocated by
the king, cherish the hard-won peaceful situation in the country,
and work for the peace and development in Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
Li said the Chinese government is ever attentive to the
friendly relations of cooperation with Cambodia, and the Chinese
people have always enjoyed their strong friendship with the
Cambodian people.
</P>
<P>
"We believe deeply that, through joint efforts, the exchanges
and cooperation between China and Cambodia will be expanded
continuously and that Sino-Cambodian relations have a brighter
future," Li said.
</P>
<P>
Li wished good health and happiness to the king and queen
during their stay in China.
</P>
<P>
Sihanouk said that the fact that Li hosted a dinner on the
occasion of his 75th birthday on behalf of President Jiang Zemin
and Premier Li Peng symbolizes the profound friendship between the
peoples of Cambodia and China.
</P>
<P>
The king asked Li Ruihuan to pass his thanks and regards to
President Jiang and Premier Li.
</P>
<P>
Sihanouk said it has been his great honor to meet and establish
a profound friendship with the three generations of Chinese
leaders. He remarked that the Cambodian people will always
remember the selfless help offered by the Chinese government and
people during both Cambodia's good and bad times.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Li hosted a birthday dinner for the king.
</P>
<P>
On October 29, Chinese Vice-Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan
called on the royal couple and presented a congratulatory
telegraph of President Jiang Zemin and flower baskets from Jiang
and Premier Li.

<HEADLINE> G-15 Asks WTO to Study Impact of Currency Turmoil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Trade and economic
ministers of the Group of 15 (G-15) developing countries today
called on the World Trade Organization (WTO) to study the impact
of currency fluctuations on trade after the currency crisis
plagued its members.
</P>
<P>
The ministers suggested that a working group in the WTO conduct
the study.
</P>
<P>
The study would not be on currency turmoil but on the exchange
rate and its impact on trade, Malaysian International Trade and
Industry Minister Rafidah Aziz said after chairing a meeting of
G-15 trade and economic ministers here, the first formal one as a
prelude to a G-15 summit scheduled for November 3-5.
</P>
<P>
"We want it to be done by the WTO because G-15 lacks the
capacity to carry out such a study while the world body has the
mechanism," she told reporters.
</P>
<P>
She said any member of the WTO including G-15 could raise
issues for the working group to study.
</P>
<P>
"I'm confident the experts in the working group will also look
into currency trading," she said.
</P>
<P>
Rafidah said G-15 is putting in a new agenda for the WTO to
look into, adding that though it did not put forward the proposal
during the dialogue between its economic ministers and WTO
Director-General Renato Ruggiero here today, it would bring up the
matter with the world body soon.
</P>
<P>
G-15 comprises Algeria, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Egypt, India,
Indonesia, Jamaica, Malaysia, Mexico, Nigeria, Peru, Senegal,
Venezuela and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Today's G-15 economic ministers meeting was attended by all the
member countries and Kenya which will be admitted as the
grouping's 16th member at the forthcoming summit.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Rafidah said no common position was taken on
the liberalization of the financial services sector among G-15
countries because the liberalization has wide-ranging implications
on every country.
</P>
<P>
She said the ministers, however, agreed on progressive
liberalization based on the capability and capacity of each
country to open up.
</P>
<P>
"It is up to each country to determine to what extent it can go
in liberalizing," she said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the U.N. Conference on Trade and Development
(UNCTAD), which had dialogue together with the WTO with the G-15
ministers, is willing to support G-15 members to expand trade and
investment, according to UNCTAD Deputy Secretary-General Carlos
Fortin.
</P>
<P>
"We were asked to provide support for the efforts of G-15 to
expand trade and investment among themselves and in international
markets. We are very willing to do that and the ways in which we
can do that are already under way," Fortin told reporters after
the dialogue.
</P>
<P>
Fortin said UNCTAD is going to help G-15 set an agenda for
future negotiations in the international trading system on matters
such as financial services and agriculture.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 31 (Xinhua) -- China's top legislator Qiao Shi
said here today that China-Uruguay relations have developed well
since the two countries forged diplomatic ties nine years ago.
</P>
<P>
Qiao, who is chairman of the Standing Committee of the National
People's Congress (NPC), made the remark in a meeting with Carlos
Baraibar, president of the Chamber of Deputies of the National
Congress of Uruguay.
</P>
<P>
He said that bilateral economic and trade cooperation has been
constantly expanding, and that the two countries share identical
or similar views on many major international issues.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his appreciation for Uruguay's adherence to the
"one China" stance, saying that China is ready to deepen
friendship and cooperation with all countries which stick to the
"one China" position based on the Five Principles of Peaceful
Co-existence.
</P>
<P>
Qiao said that the NPC places great importance on its relations
with the National Congress of Uruguay, and the NPC has for that
reason established a Sino-Uruguayan parliamentary liaison group.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the belief that President Baraibar's visit will
help foster friendly and cooperative relations between parliaments
of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Baraibar said the warm reception he received during his current
China visit demonstrates that the peoples of the two countries
enjoy warm feelings for each other despite the geographical
distance between them.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Uruguayan National Congress has maintained a
close relationship with the NPC, and that the two sides have had
good cooperation in the Inter-Parliamentary Union, which deepened
mutual understanding between the two countries, and enhanced
friendship between the two parliaments and parliaments in other
countries.
</P>
<P>
Baraibar offered high praise for China's reform and opening
initiated by Deng Xiaoping, saying that is of great significance
to the world.
</P>
<P>
Voicing agreement, Qiao said that the recent 15th National
Congress of the Communist Party of China highly evaluated the Deng
Xiaoping Theory, which was set as the guiding ideology of the
Communist Party of China.
</P>
<P>
Baraibar arrived here earlier today as guest of the NPC

<HEADLINE> Minority Ethnic Officials Well Trained from Working in Other Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 31 (Xinhua) -- To work for a period in central
government departments or economically booming areas has become an
effective means of raising the quality of officials from minority
ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
Over the past eight years, more than 700 minority ethnic
officials have been dispatched to work in central departments or
coastal areas, which as a result has promoted economic and social
progress in ethnic and remote areas, according to information from
a forum held here today.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was sponsored by the Organization Department of the
Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, the United Front
Work Department of the CPC Central Committee and the State
Nationalities Affairs Commission.
</P>
<P>
This year, a record 171 officials from 31 minority ethnic
groups in 17 provinces and autonomous regions went to work in some
relatively developed areas for half a year, according to Zhu
Xiaoming, an official with the United Front Work Department,
</P>
<P>
This practice helps minority ethnic officials widen their
perspective, see the social and economic gaps between different
areas, and better identify their responsibilities back home, Zhu
Xiaoming said.
</P>
<P>
Wang Zhaoguo, vice-chairman of the National Committee of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and head of the
United Front Work Department, attended the forum today. He urged
the minority ethnic officials to take the advanced ideas and
skills they have learned back to their hometowns so as to promote
local economic and social progress and ethnic unity.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1,000 minority ethnic officials are scheduled to be
chosen to participate in the project by the end of the century.

</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, as the world's economy is marching towards

With this in mind, it is all the more imperative for China and
Japan to further tighten their cooperation, Li stressed.

and encouraged the association to participate in the development
of China's central and western regions.

<HEADLINE> S. Korean Opposition Parties Select Presidential Candidate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, October 31 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's two opposition
parties -- the major National Congress for New Politic (NCNP) and
minor United Liberal Democrats (ULD) -- formed an alliance today
and named NCNP leader Kim Dae-jung as its joint presidential
candidate.
</P>
<P>
ULD leader Kim Jong-pil, giving up his own candidacy, will most
likely assume the position of prime minister if the alliance wins the
December 18 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Friday's announcement ends seven months of grueling
negotiations between the two parties.
</P>
<P>
Kim Dae-jung, the front-runner for the past three months,
enjoyed a 39.2 percent lead in the latest opinion poll and is on a
nationwide tour to solidify his popularity. He is trailed by three
other candidates with a gap of almost 10 percentage points each.
</P>
<P>
Cho Soon, the presidential candidate of the tiny opposition
Democratic Party (DP), said today he will soon propose talks with
Lee Hoi-chang of the ruling New Korea Party (NKP) and former
Kyonggi Governor Rhee In-je in order to forge a joint candidacy
against Kim's alliance.
</P>
<P>
"The more often we get together, the more likely it is that we
will achieve a single candidacy," said the former Seoul mayor, who
is currently in fourth place in the opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
He said that he thinks Lee and Rhee will likely react favorably
to his proposal. If the three join forces, they will easily defeat
Kim Dae-jung in the coming election, he claimed.
</P>
<P>
The three candidates, including Rhee who left the ruling party
to run on his own ticket after he was defeated by Lee in the
party's nomination, appeared unwilling to renounce their
candidacies, political observers say.
</P>
<P>
Cho himself, when asked if he will give up his candidacy to
pave the way for one of his alliance partners in the upcoming
vote, made it clear that he will not retire from the presidential
race under any circumstances.

<HEADLINE> Mongolia Amends Military Service Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, October 31 (Xinhua) -- The Mongolian Great Hural
has in its on-going autumn session amended the military service
law, according to local press reports today.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the amended law, if young people of the
proper age refuse to register for enlistment in the army, they can
either work for two years without payment in a civil or public
welfare department, or compensate the nation with an appropriate
sum of money. This could serve as a substitution for service in
the army.
</P>
<P>
Mongolia at present still requires from its youth one-year of
compulsory military service.
</P>
<P>
Although related laws stipulate that young people of the proper
age are obliged to enlist in the army, they are not necessarily
willing to serve in the army. This has led to a shortage of
manpower for the military service and limited the quality and
selection of soldiers.
</P>
<P>
As a result of these circumstances, Mongolia has made
amendments to the military service law.

<HEADLINE> Government Support to Forest Expansion Urged in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Wang Bingqian, vice-chairman of
the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC),
has urged the Chinese government to support forest expansion by
adopting new policies.
</P>
<P>
"To maintain the sustainable and healthy development of
forestry, the government must adjust the present policy," Wang
said at the 28th Session of the NPC Standing Committee, which is
opened here today.
</P>
<P>
"While investing more money into forestry, the State should
also work out a low-interest, long-term loan policy to help its
development," Wang said.
</P>
<P>
A compensation fund for planting and running ecological and
shelter forests should also be established, he said.
</P>
<P>
"A low tax rate and a light tax burden on the business are
other urgent considerations," he said.
</P>
<P>
Wang stressed the importance of amending the laws and
regulations concerning forestry, especially those on effective
administration and the compensation fund system.
</P>
<P>
China adopted its first Forestry Law in 1985. The country
currently has 133.7 million hectares of forested areas, accounting
for 13.9 percent of its total land area. In the early 1980s,
about 12 percent of the country's land mass was covered by forest.
</P>
<P>
Although the law strictly limits the felling of trees, the
country cuts two million hectares of forest a year,
considerably offsetting its annual planting of 5.3 million hectares
of woods.
</P>
<P>
The NPC Standing Committee is deliberating the amendments of
Forestry Law during the six-day meeting.

<HEADLINE> IMF Extends Assistance to Indonesia for 3 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 31 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF), the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank will provide
Indonesia with a three-year technical assistance package, a senior
official said here today.
</P>
<P>
"The team from the IMF has understood what we are planning and
will give full support for it," State Secretary Moerdiono said
after a meeting with President Soeharto.
</P>
<P>
However, Moerdiono did not disclose the amount of the
assistance from the IMF.
</P>
<P>
He said the three financial institutions will offer input to
improve under-performing programs while upgrading and continuing
well-implemented ones.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Finance Minister Mar'ie Muhammad said that among the
programs to be assessed by the teams from these institutions will
be the restoration of the financial sector's health, fiscal
policy, monetary policy including the exchange rate policy and
structural adjustment.
</P>
<P>
Restoring the health of the financial sector would cover banks,
financial institutions, insurance and pension funds and capital
market institutions such as mutual funds and security houses, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the program for the fiscal sector is basically
aimed at increasing government revenue and reducing expenditures
and will be followed by an improvement of budget discipline to
help the country avoid a budget deficit in the 1997/98 fiscal
year.
</P>
<P>
Central bank governor Soedradjad Djiwandono, who also met with
the president, said the program for the monetary sector will
basically continue policies already enacted by enhancing the level
of caution so that the inflation rate can be maintained at a
single digit.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the fundamental objective of the structural
adjustment program is to increase national efficiency and the
competitiveness of the Indonesian economy, he said.
</P>
<P>
Southeast Asian nations, including Indonesia, have been badly
hit by the current monetary crisis which started in July this
year.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian rupiah has dropped by about 50 percent against
the U.S. dollar since the beginning of this year, making it the
worst-hit currency in the region.
</P>
<P>
On October 8, the Indonesian government decided to seek
long-term loans from international institutions, including the IMF
and the two sides started their negotiations on October 10.
</P>
<P>
According to sources close to the talks, the IMF is set to
announce this evening a 15 billion U.S. dollar emergency aid
package for Indonesia while the United States will commit roughly
3 billion dollars.

<P>
Jiang is on a nine-day tour of the United States, the first by
a Chinese head of state to the U.S. in 12 years. A joint statement
issued on Wednesday following the Jiang-Clinton talks called for
building a constructive, strategic China-U.S. partnership oriented
toward the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Japanese newspapers carried editorials emphasizing the
significance of the China-U.S. summit and the joint statement.
</P>
<P>
"It is significant that the United States and China have put
their relations on an even keel and agreed to build a
constructive, strategic partnership," the Asahi Shimbun said.
</P>
<P>
Japan, which has friendly relations with both China and the
United States, welcomes the development of China-U.S. ties, the
Asahi added.
</P>
<P>
"There is no doubt that cooperation between the United States
and China will greatly help solve some international disputes,"
the Asahi said.
</P>
<P>
The Yomiuri Shimbun described the China-U.S. summit as a
prelude to establishing a more stable and orderly world in the
next century.
</P>
<P>
Noting that "a major agreement" (on a strategic partnership)
was achieved at the summit meeting, the Japanese daily said the
"major agreement" is certain to serve as a factor shaping the
world in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
The Mainichi Shimbun said a new bridge has been established
between Beijing and Washington, which will greatly influence world
politics.

<HEADLINE> HK Publishes Elector Registration Regulation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's Electoral Affairs
Committee (EAC) today gazetted a regulation making arrangements
for the registration of electors for geographical constituencies
for the 1998 Legislative Council election.
</P>
<P>
The regulation is aimed at setting out the procedure for the
preparation of registration of electors, EAC Chairman Justice Woo
Kwok-hing told a press conference today.
</P>
<P>
To ensure that the registration system works and to guard
against misuse of the information obtained by the Electoral
Registration Officer for non-election purposes, the regulation
makes it an offense for any person to give a false statement in
relation to voter registration or make others do the same.
</P>
<P>
Penalties for these offenses include disqualification from
being registered as an elector and voting at an election and also
from being nominated as a candidate.
</P>
<P>
One will be disqualified as a candidate if he obtains an
extract of a register and use it for a purpose other than those
related to the election or imparts its contents to another person
or fails to furnish information in response to a requirement
within the specified period.
</P>
<P>
The regulation will be tabled at the Provisional Legislative
Council (PLC) for negative vetting on November 5 and come into
effect on the same day if approved.
</P>
<P>
Woo said this is to enable elector registration to start
immediately on the same day so that eligible persons may have more
time to register.
</P>
<P>
He said the registration period will last until January 16,
1998, and he urged the public to register as electors and vote in
the legislative election.
</P>
<P>
Under the Basic Law, all permanent residents of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (SAR) of China, who have reached the
age of 18, have the right to vote and the right to stand for
election.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the EAC today submitted to SAR Chief Executive Tung
Chee Hwa a report on its final recommendation on the delineation
of geographical constituency boundaries for the Legislative
Council election.
</P>
<P>
The final recommendations have been drawn up after taking into
consideration all views expressed by the public on the EAC's
provisional recommendations during a two-week public consultation
between October 11 and 24.
</P>
<P>
"The decision of the chief executive will be gazetted in the
form of an order, which will be tabled in the PLC. A copy of the
EAC's report will also be tabled in the PLC in accordance with the
law," a government spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the Financial Committee today approved a
supplementary provision of 167.52 million HK dollars (23.93
million U.S. dollars) to cover expenditure on various preparatory
work for the legislative election, which includes voter
registration and related tasks for the compilation of the
electoral roll.
</P>
<P>
The overall financial requirement for the election is about 500
million HK dollars (64.1 million U.S. dollars), the spokesman
said.

<HEADLINE> Fiji to Re-establish Diplomatic Ties With India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Fijian Prime Minister Sitiveni
Rabuka has said his country will soon re-establish diplomatic
relations with India.
</P>
<P>
Fiji's restoration of diplomatic links with India will revolve
on its relations with other Asian countries, the Australian
Associated Press today quoted Rabuka as saying on his return from
the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting held on October 24-27
in Edinburgh, Scotland.
</P>
<P>
He said Indian Prime Minister Indar Kumar Gujral reassured him
of the move at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
"We will have to look at our relations with the whole Asian
region," Rabuka said, adding that he believed Fiji "can gain a
lot" by possibly opening other missions in the region.
</P>
<P>
"The only problem I have at the moment is that Indian investors
may go and invest where labor costs are not as high as in Fiji,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
India cut off diplomatic ties with Fiji in May 1990 when Fiji's
interim government expelled its ambassador, accusing him of
involvement in covert political activities.

<HEADLINE> Round-up: Big Hopes Pinned on Upcoming Washington </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Big hopes are pinned on the
upcoming negotiations to be held in Washington by Israeli and
Palestinian officials aimed at reaching agreements that will
accelerate the slow-moving peace process.
</P>
<P>
From Monday, Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy and
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) deputy head Mahmoud Abbas
(Abu Mazen), under the sponsorship of the U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, will start serious negotiations on
implementing the rest of the interim agreements.
</P>
<P>
Top on the agenda will be reaching agreements on opening the
Gaza airport and seaport, and on the launching of a joint
industrial park at the Karni crossing between Israel and the Gaza
Strip.
</P>
<P>
But the toughest wrangling will be centered on the dispute over
the issues of Israel's further troop redeployments in the West
Bank and the time-out of Israeli settlement activities.
</P>
<P>
Levy decided to travel to Washington only after he was allegedly
given a mandate and guidelines on how to conduct the negotiations
on the difficult issues, such as the settlement freeze, further
redeployments and the basis for holding the permanent talks.
</P>
<P>
The mandate to negotiate was given Wednesday by Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu after conducting marathon consultations with
his inner Cabinet ministers to formulate the guidelines for the
Washington talks.
</P>
<P>
No details have been disclosed on what the bottom lines have
been formulated by the cabinet on those sensitive issues. Local
media reported that Levy is to propose a nine-month settlement
freeze in return for a concomitant postponement of further
redeployments in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
But this report was denied by Levy's aides. "Our concepts and
proposals are secret at this stage," said Freddy Eitan, one of
Levy's senior aides.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, as part of intensive preparations for the
Washington talks, originally scheduled for October 27 and
postponed due to the wrangling within the Israeli government, it
was revealed that the two sides have been holding secret talks to
try to solve the dispute over further Israeli redeployments.

mee103109hke -- Round-up: Big Hopes Pinned on Upcoming Washington
</P>
<P>
Talks Part II
</P>
<P>
The talks were reportedly held by Netanyahu's attorney Yitzhak
Molcho and Speaker of Palestinian Legislative Council Ahmed
Queria (Abu Ala).
</P>
<P>
Under the signed agreements, Israel should have completed the
first and second phases of the three-stage further troop pullouts
from the West Bank by early September, but they have been delayed
due to the dispute over the scope of redeployments.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side remains dubious about the Israeli
government's seriousness to conduct real negotiations. PNA
President Yasser Arafat has said that he doubts if Levy has real
mandate to make concessions.
</P>
<P>
Senior Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat also expressed doubt
Thursday if the talks will be productive since Israel is only
interested in negotiations for negotiation's sake. While
"President Arafat wants to revive the peace process through
implementation of (what is) on the ground," he told Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
In order to achieve a breakthrough in the talks to prevent
renewal of tensions due to lack of progress, the U.S. government
is pressuring the two parties to make reciprocal concessions.
</P>
<P>
Albright is expected to strongly urge Israel to accept a
time-out of its settlement activities.
</P>
<P>
The speculation is rife here that, even if the sides fail to
solve the settlement dispute, they will at least reach agreements
on opening the Gaza airport and seaport as well as launching a
joint industrial park so to create a favorable atmosphere for
conducting further talks.
</P>
<P>
Eitan Bentsur, Director-General of Israeli Foreign Ministry,
said Thursday that at least one major agreement will be signed
as a result of Albright's pressure, adding Israel is ready for
making a gesture.
</P>
<P>
"The infrastructure at Karni (crossing) is ready. If the deal
is concluded funding can be anticipated from the International
Bank," he said.

<HEADLINE> Qatar Edges China 3-2 in World Cup Qualifier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, northeastern Liaoning, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Qatar
edges China 3-2 in an Asian qualifier here Friday to keep alive
their slim hope of qualifying for the next year's World Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
China opened the scoring in the 22nd minute of the Group A
match in the second stage of the Asian Zone qualifying competition.
</P>
<P>
After a blast from Chinese defender Fan Zhiyi was deflected off
a Qatar player, Striker Gao Feng pounced on to head the ball into
the net.
</P>
<P>
Qatar equalized in the injury time of the first half, when
19-year-old Dahi Saad Al-Naemi scored on a Yaser Alousi pass.
</P>
<P>
Mohamed Salem Al-Enazi put the visitors ahead 2-1 10 minutes
into the second half, netting on another Alousi pass.
</P>
<P>
Zamel Essa Al-Kuwart added one for Qatar in the 60th minute,
capitalizing a fatal mistake made by China's midfielder Ma Mingyu
as Ma passed the ball into a Qatari player just outside the
penalty area.
</P>
<P>
China pulled one back in the 82nd minute through Fan, who
blasted in the area after receiving a Xie Feng pass.
</P>
<P>
Qatari players Yousuf Mahmoud, Al-Naemi, Saoud Fath Al-Kathiri
were each handed a yellow card by Singaporean referee
S. Nagalingam. China's Sun Jihai was also booked.
</P>
<P>
"I told my players during the break that we would definitely
win the match. I said as long as we press the Chinese hard enough,
we would snatch the victory," Qatar's head coach Jamal Hajae said.
</P>
<P>
Chinese head coach Qi Wusheng said: "My team failed to take
advantage of the good situation when we led 1-0 in the first
half. My players were not quick and responsive enough when they
fought for the control in the midfield and thwarting their
counterattacks.
</P>
<P>
"We were not fast in the first half and in the second we lost
our composure and the tactics was also irrational," Qi added.
</P>
<P>
In the group, Iran now takes the lead with 11 points, followed
by Saudi Arabia's 10.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait, China and Qatar each has seven points from two wins,
one draw and three losses.
</P>
<P>
Among the trio Kuwait has the best goal difference while Qatar
is at the bottom of the group with the worst but still in the
picture.
</P>
<P>
The group winner qualifies for the 1998 France World Cup, while
the runner-up will face the Group B second-placer in a play-off,
whose winner also qualifies. The loser will face Australia to vie
for a berth in the finals next years.

<HEADLINE> Enterprises at Three Gorges See Opportunity in Relocation(1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YICHANG, October 31 (Xinhua) -- The Taiji Group in Fuling,
southwest China's Chongqing Municipality, was formerly a small
Yangtze River Valley workshop with some 100 employees.
</P>
<P>
The plant, located in an area which will be inundated by the
year 2003 due to construction of the world's largest hydropower
station --Three Gorges Project -- faced the inevitability of
relocating to higher ground.
</P>
<P>
Plant officials took the initiative and worked together with
local resettlement officials for an earlier relocation date.
</P>
<P>
"Relocation is far from a burden, but is instead an
opportunity for future development," said a plant official,
adding that "relocation not only offers a new plant site, but also
the chance to attain higher standards through self-development."
</P>
<P>
The plant responded by allocating some 13 million yuan in
compensation funds for technological upgrades for a new facility,
with related efforts greatly enhancing its opportunities for
further development.
</P>
<P>
The pharmaceuticals manufacturer has since grown into an
enterprise group with an annual output value of 800 million
yuan. The Fuling Taiji Group is also preparing to list shares on
the Shanghai Stock Market. Fuling Taiji will be the second
enterprise from the Three Gorges Reservoir Area to gain an
exchange listing, following the Fuling Construction Ceramics
Co. Limited.
</P>
<P>
Fuling Taiji is a successful example of China's efforts to help
relocated enterprises enhance their reserve strength for
self-development and use relocation to realize industrial
structuring.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the Three Gorges Project will necessitate the
relocation of 1,599 factories of central China's Hubei Province
and Chongqing Municipality prior to completion of the Three Gorges
Dam in the year of 2009.
</P>
<P>
An economist from the State Planning Commission Economics
Institute notes the following features for most enterprises
scheduled for relocation: irrational industrial structures; low
technology products; outdated equipment; wasted resources; low
economic efficiency; and a lack of competitiveness under the
current situation centered on building a modern enterprise system.
</P>
<P>
"Relocation will provide an excellent opportunity for new
development and will offer a fresh start to all enterprises
relocated from the Three Gorges Reservoir Area," according to the
official.

<HEADLINE> Enterprises at Three Gorges See Opportunity in Relocation(2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Resettlement offices in different localities in the Three
Gorges Area, which extends more than 600 km, have established
divisions to guide the relocation of enterprises.
</P>
<P>
During an interview with Xinhua, an official from the
Enterprises Relocation Division of the Chongqing Municipal
Resettlement Bureau said that the industrial reshuffling of
enterprises in the Three Gorges Area will foster new economic
powerhouses in areas suffering from underdevelopment. He said it
will also promote enterprise reform in the municipality, and
ensure sustainable, rapid and healthy development of the city's
economy.
</P>
<P>
The municipal government of Chongqing, the area with the
greatest number of enterprises requiring relocation, encourages
stronger ventures to introduce technological upgrades when
constructing new facilities.
</P>
<P>
Weaker enterprises are encouraged to join hands and carry out
relocation efforts on a cooperative basis. Various loss-making
enterprises can also be merged with stronger ventures in the
locality, or with successful ventures in developed coastal areas
in eastern and southern China.
</P>
<P>
Enterprises subject to relocation can also join force to
establish limited liability companies in order to achieve
industrial restructuring, said the official, adding that "so doing
will ensure the timely relocation of enterprises, in addition to
ensuring their stability and capacity to expand."
</P>
<P>
The central government has introduced wide-ranging preferential
policies to help relocated enterprises carry out technological
upgrades and encourage foreign investors and enterprises from
economically developed areas in east China to invest in the Three
Gorges Area,
</P>
<P>
The long list of preferential policies include allowing
Yichang, Wanxian and Fuling to adopt policies previously reserved
for open coastal cities, and allowing all counties from the Three
Gorges Reservoir Area to introduce policies formerly reserved for
open coastal development zones.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the government will provide 500 million yuan in
special loans to enable relocated enterprises to undertake
technological upgrades, with the loan volume rising to one billion
yuan annually in ensuing years..
</P>
<P>
Enterprises which have received foreign funding and assistance
from China's coastal areas and economically developed regions will
enjoy annual tariff rebates for imported production equipment.

TOKYO, October 31 (Xinhua) -- No Agreement has been reached on
Friday's meeting on downhill dispute between International Ski
Federation (FIS) leader and Nagano Winter Olympics (NAOC) head
organiser in Nagano, Japan.
</P>
<P>
No details were disclosed after the over-one-hour discussion.

"The most important thing was that there was a meeting," said
FIS president Hodler, who was not sure how and when the dispute
would be resolved after the talk with NAOC director-general
Makoto Kobayashi, reports said from Nagano.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian GDP Grows Against Low Living Standard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian economy has
been growing at an average rate of 4-5 percent per annum during
the past decade, Business Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
This growth performance has enabled per capita incomes to
increase by between 1-2 percent to 2.2 percent annually during
the last 10 years, said the report quoing figures issued by the
Bank of Tanzania in September.
</P>
<P>
However, this modest increment in the living standards has not
reduced poverty, nor does it seem to have filtered to majority of
people.
</P>
<P>
To eradicate absolute poverty in Tanzania, growth rates of 7-8
percent per annum are required during the next decade, it said,
and if Tanzania economy grows at an average rate of 8 percent for
the next 15 years, average per capita income will then be 440 US
Dollars, a level which is about 10 percent of the current per
capita income of Malaysia, the report pointed out.
</P>
<P>
To attain the goal, it said, Tanzania needs the adoption of
improved and modern methods of production in agriculture,
industry and services.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the modernization of production methods, which will
lead to higher productivity of labor or capital, other essential
measures which will guarantee accelerated economic growth have
been listed by the newspaper as follows:
</P>
<P>
Adequate provision of basic infrastructure, for example,
water, reliable electricity, working telephone systems and sound
transportation system.
</P>
<P>
Others are supportive legal infrastructure for efficient
operation of market economy, and better economic management.
</P>
<P>
The paper also called for an adoption of outward looking
economic policies, for example, the pursuit of export led growth.

<HEADLINE> China Starts Rice Seed Selection 5,500 Years Ago </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Some 4,000 carbonized grains of
rice discovered in east China's Jiangsu Province have shifted
China's history of selecting rice seeds for farming to at least
5,500 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The carbonized rice grains were discovered at the Neolithic Age
Site at Longqiuzhuang near Gaoyou City, to the north of the
Yangtze River. Experts say the discovery proves that ancient
Chinese were breeding selected fine strains of rice between
5,500-7,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Scientific analysis shows that the length, width and thickness
of the rice grains found in the fourth stratus of the ruins differ
from those found in some deeper strata. Experts conclude that the
differences indicate advances in the development of rice
cultivation.
</P>
<P>
Researchers noted that the find represents the first discovery
of such a large quantity of historical materials in China, and
should contribute greatly to research of the origin and spread
of the paddy agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The Longqiuzhuang Ruins, which cover over 40,000 sq.m. and are
the largest excavation site in the area, have yielded a large
number of cultural relics and artifacts.

<HEADLINE> Australia Offers 44 Million US dollars in Aid to PNG </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Australia will provide 44.8
million U.S. dollars in aid programs for drought-ravaged Papua New
Guinea (PNG) to help improve the country's rural health services
and agricultural research, according to local press reports.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said Australia would fund a
35-million-dollar rural health program over five years, and
provide an extra 9.8 million dollar for agricultural research to
help villagers who rely on subsistence farming for their food
supply.
</P>
<P>
Downer made the announcement after the annual PNG-Australia
ministerial talks in Alotau in PNG's eastern Milne Bay province.
</P>
<P>
The funding comes as PNG has been hit by a major drought and
frosts. Up to half a million people are facing serious food
shortages in the highlands.
</P>
<P>
The rural health funding was given in view of the high maternal
and child mortality rates and the high incidence of preventable
diseases in rural communities in PNG, the foreign minister said in
a statement.
</P>
<P>
He said the funds for agricultural research would help the 3.5
million Papua New Guineans who live in rural and remote villages
and who rely on crops for their livelihood.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Downer said the drought in PNG was worse than he had
expected and Australia would do everything it could to try to
prevent lives from being lost.
</P>
<P>
Australia has already contributed around 2.1 million dollars in
drought aid to PNG.

<P>
HONG KONG, October 31 (Xinhua) -- The water quality of most of
Hong Kong's 37 beaches is good and suitable for swimming,
according to the latest official weekly report on the beach water
quality monitoring results.
</P>
<P>
Of the beaches, 20 are found to be in good condition (Grade 1),
11 "fair" (Grade 2) and six "poor" (Grade 3), according to the
report.
</P>
<P>
The beach grading results are announced weekly on every Friday
during the bathing season to coincide with the weekly frequency of
beach monitoring by the Environmental Protection Department (EPD).
</P>
<P>
As the local bathing season ends on Friday, this was the last
such report for the year on beach water quality.
</P>
<P>
Under EPD's monitoring system, beaches are classified into four
grades according to the most recent trends in E. coli data
collected.
</P>
<P>
Beaches are, in general, likely to be more polluted than the
grades suggested during and after periods of heavy rain. So
bathers are advised to avoid swimming at beaches, particularly
Grades 3 and 4 beaches, for a few days after a storm or heavy
rainfall. Grade 4 beaches are generally considered unsuitable at
any time.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Calls for Foreign Investment in Power </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 31 (Xinhua) -- A leading official from
Nigeria's power industry has called for foreign investment to
meet the sector's demand for huge fund in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
Hamzat Ibrahim, the Managing Director of the National Electric
Power Authority made the call Wednesday at a workshop hosted by
the National Association of Energy Correspondent in Lagos.
</P>
<P>
He estimated that the power industry needs about 63 billion
U.S. dollars in the next 15 years to attain its goals.
</P>
<P>
These goals, according to Ibrahim, include increasing the
percentage of the population that have access to power from 30 to
85 percent, increasing the per capita energy consumption from
161.38 to 3,452 Kwh, and improving the reliability of electricity
supply to 99 percent.
</P>
<P>
To attain the goals, the country will need 74,000 mega watts
of new generating capacity and more than 15,000 kilometers of
transmission lines, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Ibrahim identified low electricity price, rampant
vandalization of equipment and widespread unpayment by consumers
as obstacles to attain stable and reliable power supply.
</P>
<P>
To attract foreign investment, he said, government must
establish an enabling environment through the establishment of a
clear regulatory system.
</P>
<P>
He also discussed the models of private and foreign
participation in the industry, including the build-own-operation
model (BOO).
</P>
<P>
He disclosed discussions are underway between Nigerian
authorities and the Mobil Power Incorporated to build a 350 mega
watts power plant in Rivers State in southern Nigeria under the
BOO model.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone Junta Accused of Arms Import Backed by </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 31 (Xinhua) -- The military junta in Sierra
Leone has been accused of violating the peace accord to quit
office in April next year and importing arms with Liberia's
support.
</P>
<P>
An aide of deposed president Ahmed Tejan Kabbah, Ben Williams,
said on Thursday that Liberian president Charles Taylor's former
rebels group were assisting the junta to bring in truckloads of
arms into Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
"We are having information that Charles Taylor's government in
Liberia is working with the junta to undermine the peace plan,"
Williams said, quoted by a report reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
West African countries signed an agreement with the junta last
week in Conakry, Guinea on peaceful resolution of the crisis in
Sierra Leone triggered off by the May 25 coup that overthrew
Kabbah's legitimate government.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, the military government will hand over power
to Kabbah on April 22, 1998.
</P>
<P>
The arms and fuel embargo on the junta imposed by the United
Nations and the Economic Community of West African States
(ECOWAS) will remain effective during the transition period.
</P>
<P>
But Williams warned that the illegal import of arms and
ammunition was preparatory to an all-out offensive against the
ECOWAS peacekeeping force known as ECOMOG enforcing the sanctions
in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
According to him, some arms-laden ships are off the Sierra
Leonean coast and "they are offloading two ships".
</P>
<P>
Williams, who has been running Kabbah's radio station outside
the capital Freetown, also accused the junta of trying to jam the
frequency of the radio station.
</P>
<P>
The allegation comes as Kabbah is visiting Europe to canvas
international assistance to rebuild his war-torn country when he
returns to office.
</P>
<P>
Kabbah has queried the rationale for the April next year date
for his return to office instead of an immediate reinstatement as
required by the UN and the entire international community.

<P>
MAPUTO, October 31 (Xinhua) -- The Mozambican Customs has
ordered to shut down an Iranian Trade Fair being held in the
country for overpricing.
</P>
<P>
The second Iranian Trade Fair which started Tuesday was
ordered by the Customs yesterday to be closed down by November 7,
according to local paper Naticias.
</P>
<P>
The customs said that the Iranians have claimed at a lower
prices for the goods when they enter the country and are selling
them at a much higher price at the fair.
</P>
<P>
To solve the problems, the Iranian businessmen are ordered to
have all their commodities, including those on the shelves at the
fair, re-evaluated before they can re-open the fair, the paper
said.
</P>
<P>
But Abdul Aly Tavakale expressed regret for what the
Mozambican customs authorities are doing, saying that the Iranian
businessmen have gone through all the necessary procedures for
the fair and they would re-consider whether it is worthwhile to
have more such fair in the country.
</P>
<P>
Tavakale said, however, what happens to the trade fair would
not hurt the Mozambican-Iranian relations, as the two countries
has more business to do.
</P>
<P>
There are household electric appliances, furnitures,
stationery, clothes, bicycles, food and other things at an
estimated value of two million US Dollars.

listed 3.5 billion yuan in bonds on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange to
raise funds for China's major railway construction projects.
</P>
<P>
Funds from the listing will be used to either construct or
upgrade facilities for 12 key railway projects, with total
investment expected to hit 83.7 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
China had provided 5.4 billion yuan in funding for the 12
projects by 1995, with substantial funding going for the
Beijing-Kowloon and Datong-Qinhuangdao railways, and the Beijing
West Railway Station.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Vietnam's Coffee Export Goes Up 73% </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam has exported some 275,000
tons of coffee so far this year, a 73 percent increase over the
same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam ranks first in Asia and fourth in the world for coffee
exports, according to the Vietnam Coffee Corporation.
</P>
<P>
It expects to become the world's biggest exporter of arabica
coffee this year, the corporation said.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam has increased its coffee acreage under cultivation to
220,000 hectares and export volume to over 300,000 tons per year
from about 20,000 hectares and 10,000 tons in 1980 respectively.
</P>
<P>
As Vietnam's second biggest farm export after rice, coffee
earns the country nearly 500 million U.S. dollars per year.
</P>
<P>
Vietnamese coffee is now exported to 39 countries, including
the United States and Japan. In the past, however, the country's
coffee was mainly sent to Singapore.
</P>
<P>
There are now about 300,000 household-based coffee farms
nationwide, with coffee acreage and output of state-run
plantations representing only 20 percent of the country's total
acreage and output.
</P>
<P>
Coffee growing has generated more job opportunities in rural
mountainous areas and increased local people's incomes.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's national coffee development program to the year 2005
has set a target of cultivating 100,000 more hectares of coffee,
raising the country's total coffee acreage to 350,000 hectares,
with the annual output estimated at 450,000 tons, including
one-third of the crop being robusta coffee.
</P>
<P>
Export turnover is expected to reach about 600-700 million
U.S. dollars in 2005 and one billion dollars in 2010.

SHANGHAI, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai, China's economic
powerhouse, has maintained a strong growth momentum in industry
this year.
</P>
<P>
The total industrial output value of the city in the first
three quarters of the year was 341.1 billion yuan, up 15.1
percent from the same period last year, according to statistics.
</P>
<P>
The comprehensive economic efficiency index for Shanghai's
industrial sector reached a historic high of 129.59 points last
August, up 17.53 points from the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
Analysts attribute the soaring index to increased profits,
reduced costs and rapid cash flow into the city's industry.
</P>
<P>
In the first eight months of 1997, industrial pre-tax profits
were 27.7 billion yuan, up 4.1 percent over the same period last
year.
</P>
<P>
The 50 major technology upgrading projects in the last three
years have resulted in an output value of 19.5 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Industrial growth has also benefited from restructuring, said a
Shanghai official.
</P>

The city's goal for this year is to increase industrial output
value by 14.5 percent.

<HEADLINE> Coffee Prices in Tanzania Likely to Drop Next </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Coffee prices in
Tanzania are likely to drop by 19 percent from next month due to
a fall in the commodity's prices in the world market.
</P>
<P>
Due to increased coffee production around the world, those in
the coffee industry forecast a drop in prices, industry sources
said here this week.
</P>
<P>
The general manager of both African Coffee Company and
Milcafe, Eric Whiteside, said that local buyers and cooperative
societies will start purchasing one kilogram of coffee at 1,300
Tanzanian shillings (about 2.1 US dollars) instead of 1,400 for
the Arabica type, according to a report in today's newspaper
Guardian.
</P>
<P>
Whiteside, who devoted about 40 years in coffee farming in
Tanzania, said despite the fall in coffee prices, its production
has also dropped consecutively for the last 20 years.
</P>
<P>
Whiteside said that he has set up about 10 coffee nurseries in
Arusha and Kilimanjaro. Approximately 450,000 seedlings were
planted in last year's long rains season and 180,000 seedlings
during the short rains last year.
</P>
<P>
He urged coffee growers in Arusha, Kilimanjaro and Tanga
regions to replace their old coffee trees with new seedlings
which are resistant to disease and give high yields.
</P>
<P>
Coffee is the second Tanzania's leading foreign exchange
earner after cotton, bringing in nearly 70 million US dollars
annually. Yearly output of coffee in the east African country is
slightly less than 50,000 tons.

<HEADLINE> Kazakhstan Suffers From 1,966 Forest Fires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA ATA, October 31 (Xinhua) -- As many as 1,966 forest fires
have occurred in Kazakhstan from April to October this year,
bringing the number and the damage they caused to a record high,
the Forestry Authority said.
</P>
<P>
Higher temperature and fewer rainfalls nationwide this year
were the main factors leading to the increase of forest fires in
spring, summer and autumn, it was reported.
</P>
<P>
Besides, it also resulted from lack of funds, equipment and
effective measures to put out fires.
</P>
<P>
According to a "Kazakhstan Pravda" report, large forest fires
happened in such areas as the Akmola Region, Eastern Kazakhstan
Region as well as the Bayan-Aulsk National Park, engulfing
altogether 170,800 hectares of forest and bringing the economic
losses to 8.34 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the sharp increase of small forest fires resulted
in a 9.6 million dollars of losses.

<HEADLINE> Chiluba: Bigwigs Involved in Military Coup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba has indicated that some bigwigs in his country could have
masterminded Tuesday's abortive military coup, a
government-owned newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to an allegation made by Sikota Wina, national
chairman of the ruling Movement for Multi-Party Democracy (MMD)
who earlier charged that the "big fish" in the coup attempt are
still hiding, Chiluba said at the State House Thursday that it is
true that some masterminds can still be at large, according to
Times of Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to thousands of MMD members who marched to the State
House to show their solidarity with the president, Chiluba
claimed that the coupists arrested so far have started
cooperating with the police and vital information on the foiled
coup began to trickle in.
</P>
<P>
Early Tuesday morning, some army soldiers staged a coup
attempt in the capital to overthrow the MMD government. They once
took the state radio and declared they had taken over the
country.
</P>
<P>
However, the coup was quickly crushed by the armed forces
loyal to the government.
</P>
<P>
Without stating categorically whether the masterminds of the
coup are political or military bigwigs, Chiluba said that
"derogatory" and "inflammatory" statements have been issued which
point to the coup and will be investigated.
</P>
<P>
All those arrested or implicated in the coup attempt would be
taken to courts, the president stressed.
</P>
<P>
Only the courts, said Chiluba, will determine whether the
"inflammatory" and "derogatory" statements which point to the
coup prior to the action are coincidental or not.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of Tuesday's military coup, former President
Kenneth Kaunda warned in an interview with Zambia's main
independent newspaper The Post that there will be an explosion
soon unless the MMD government holds genuine dialogue with
opposition parties over political differences.
</P>
<P>
When Tuesday's coup happened, Kaunda, leader of the United
National Independence Party (UNIP), a main opposition party in
Zambia, was in South Africa to attend Friday's coronation of the
king of Lesotho.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Visits His Teacher in Philadelphia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHILADELPHIA, the United States, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Chinese
President Jiang Zemin today had a 40-minute cordial meeting with
his teacher Yu-hsiu Ku before visiting the town's two famous
universities and the Independence Hall.
</P>
<P>
Immediately after arriving at the airport here from Washington,
Jiang went to Ku's home in downtown Philadelphia, where he was
warmly received by Ku's family and had a very happy reunion with
his teacher.
</P>
<P>
Ku, 96, was an electrical engineering professor when Jiang was
a student at the Shanghai Jiaotong University in the late 1940s.
</P>
<P>
In November 1995, Ku went to New York and had a reunion with
Jiang who was attending a special commemorative conference of the
50th anniversary of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Recalling the meeting, Jiang told Ku that at that moment he was
thinking of calling at Ku's home some day.
</P>
<P>
Ku's wife, 97, served a soup of lotus seeds for Jiang. In
Chinese tradition, this soup implies mother's love for her son.
</P>
<P>
Afterwards, Jiang went on to visit the Drexel University and
the University of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
He was welcomed by more than 1,000 teachers and students at the
Drexel University including its president Constantine Papadakis,
who had invited Jiang to visit the campus last summer.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the gathering, Jiang congratulated the achievements
made by the university since it was built 106 years ago.
</P>
<P>
With about 11,000 students from more than 100 countries, Drexel
is Philadelphia's technology-based, co-operative education
university, offering 49 bachelor's programs, 41 master's programs,
and 17 doctoral programs.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also toured the Independence Hall.
</P>
<P>
"I'm very pleased to have the opportunity to visit beautiful
Philadelphia -- the birthplace of the United States as a nation,"
said Jiang at the Hall.
</P>
<P>
The Independence Hall was the place where the Declaration of
Independence and the Federal Constitution came into being in the
early days when the country was born.

<HEADLINE> US to Help Uganda Boost Cocoa Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, October 31 (Xinhua) -- The United States Agency for
International Development (USAID) has pledged to boost Uganda's
cocoa production as an alternative exports crop to coffee,
Uganda's number one export crop.
</P>
<P>
USAID's head of agriculture division in Uganda Ron Stryker was
quoted by the local daily, The Monitor, today as saying that
focus will be on rehabilitating the almost abandoned cocoa
plantations.
</P>
<P>
He who toured a cocoa plantation in Mukono near Kampala
Wednesday said that the target was to boost Uganda's output from
the present 2,500 tons to 10,000 tons a year.
</P>
<P>
He said the USAID Program (1997-2000) of boosting Uganda's
cocoa production is handled through the agro-business development
center and the investment in developing export agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Rehabilitation and development of the cocoa industry in Uganda
will be done through adopting research, importation of improved
cocoa varieties and transfer of expertise and technology to
farmers, Peter Ngategize, director of the said plantation's
research center was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, cocoa plantation covers
10,843 hectares in Uganda's nine districts with Mukono district
topping the list in production.
</P>
<P>
Uganda's cocoa commercial export starts in 1917, 16 years
later when cocoas was introduced into the country by Europeans
and Asians. However, the cocoa output has been very low for the
past several decades.
</P>
<P>
Uganda produces one of the best quality cocoa in the world.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Hopes No Military Showdown for Iraqi-UN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Egypt has voiced hope that Iraq's
latest confrontation with the UN could be resolved without
recourse to military action.
</P>
<P>
"We hope the matter will not escalate into military action
because we believe any such act will have bad effects," President
Hosni Mubarak's political adviser Osama el-Baz told local
reporters on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
Iraq decided on Wednesday to exclude U.S. citizens from the
United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM), provoking a crisis
with the United Nations. Washington and London have threatened
military or retaliatory actions against it.
</P>
<P>
The UNSCOM is in charge of disarming Iraq of weapons of mass
destruction in the aftermath of the 1991 Gulf War. The
U.N. Security Council passed a resolution last week threatening an
air travel ban if Baghdad refuses to cooperate with weapon
inspectors.
</P>
<P>
"We hope the situation will be contained," Baz said, adding
that Egyptian and Iraqi envoys at the UN were in contact on the
Iraqi crisis.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's chief delegate to UN Nabil Al Arabi has characterized
the Iraqi decision to ban U.S. inspectors from entering Iraq as an
"erroneous step."
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian official said he supports the Security Council
statement issued Wednesday night urging Iraq to unconditionally
show full cooperation with the committee.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Iraq carried out its threat to ban American UN
weapons inspectors from its territory, turning back two
U.S. members of a UN inspection team that flew in from Bahrain
Thursday.

<P>
LHASA, October 31 (Xinhua) -- The Hope Project has raised over
30 million yuan (3.6 million US dollars) to help build
110 "Hope Schools" in Tibet, and help thousands of Tibetan dropouts
return to school since 1992.
</P>
<P>
The Hope Project, a national education campaign sponsored by
the China Youth Development Foundation, was launched nationwide in
October 1989, and was introduced to Tibet in 1992 by the Tibet
Youth Development Foundation.
</P>
<P>
The project has attracted widespread support in Tibet and has
significantly raised the enrolment rate of school-age children.
Local residents have donated free labor valued at over five
million yuan to build schools, as well as cash donations of over
13 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Yang Bai, a retired Tibetan worker with no descendants,
donated more than 10,000 yuan of her savings to the project.
</P>
<P>
Xu Yongtao, a soldier formerly stationed in the Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region, donated to the project on four seperate
occassions. Prior to his discharge from military service, Xu again
donated 500 yuan to help a young Tibetan girl return to
school.
</P>
<P>
The first Hope Project school in Tibet was built in Lie Mai
Village, Lhunze County. The local enrolment rate of school-age
children jumped from 60 percent to 92 percent after the establishment
of the Hope School. In addition, the enrolment at the Lhunze Hope
School has jumped from 80 to over 300 students..
</P>
<P>
Hope Project schools in Tibet are staffed by well-trained
teachers and equipped with advanced teaching facilities. A number
of schools, including the Baqen and Tingri Hope schools, were
built with local funds.
</P>
<P>
Related schools have also promoted adult education courses in
Tibet. The schools have trained large numbers of local farmers and
herdsmen in the fields of culture and modern animal husbandry
technology.

<HEADLINE> 4 Rebels Killed on Iranian Border </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Iranian border guards killed
four members of the outlawed Mujahideen Khalq Organization (MKO)
Thursday when they tried to penetrate into Iran through the
country's southwestern border of Mehran.
</P>
<P>
All equipments and weapons the four MKO members carried were
seized by the border patrol, the official news agency IRNA
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The MKO, which was founded in 1965 and was announced as an
outlawed group in 1981, is based in Iraq and has waged armed
struggle against Tehran government. Its forces are estimated at
20,000 to 50,000 strong.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian air forces launch raids on the MKO bases inside
Iraq now and then. The latest raid took place in late last month.
</P>
<P>
IRNA also said that another group of nine MKO members also
planned to enter Iran through Shur Wa Shirin region on Tuesday,
but the attempt was foiled.
</P>
<P>
The new wave of incursions and infiltrations by MKO comes as a
result of a deep disunity among its members, according to IRNA.
</P>
<P>
The United States last month designated the MKO as a terrorist
group and denied its representatives U.S. visas.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Mulls Disbanding Anti-Israeli Intelligence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat is considering disbanding
an intelligence service that targets Israel for espionage, today's
The Jerusalem Post reported.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted a senior Palestinian source as saying that
the Israeli government has demanded Arafat to dissolve the PNA
military intelligence service as a proof of the Palestinian desire
for better relations.
</P>
<P>
The source said that the service, established in 1994 and
headed by Mussa Arafat, uncle of the PNA chief, is dedicated to
collecting intelligence on the Israeli military, but also has been
accused of torturing detained Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian source said Arafat is exploring the option
of merging the military intelligence with two other security
agencies, the Preventive Security Apparatus and the General
Intelligence Service.
</P>
<P>
Bassem Eid, director of the Palestinian Human Rights
Monitoring Group, said he favors such a move. "We would welcome
the disbanding of the military intelligence apparatus, which has
arrested and tortured Palestinians in the most brutal of ways," he
said," but we hope that after it is disbanded, it will not be
assimilated to other agencies."

<HEADLINE> MILF Denies Involvement in Irish Priest's Kidnapping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 31 (Xinhua) -- The Moro Islamic Liberation
Front (MILF) today denied earlier press reports that kidnapped
Irish priest Desmond Hartford had been handed over to it by the
kidnappers.
</P>
<P>
Speaking over a radio station in Cotabato City, the southern
Philippines, MILF vice chairman for military affairs Al Haj Murad
said there is no truth to reports that Hartford had been turned
over to the MILF forces based in Lanao del Norte province.
</P>
<P>
He also denied reports that the MILF was asking for five
million pesos (140,000 U.S. dollars) as ransom in exchange for the
freedom of Hartford, who was abducted on October 26 by former Moro
National Liberation Front (MNLF) rebels.
</P>
<P>
According to Murad, the MILF was even extending efforts to help
the government in negotiating for the safe return of Hartford,
adding that he was assured the Irish priest will be released "one
of these days."
</P>
<P>
However, one of the kidnappers confirmed that they had handed
over the hostage to the MILF forces.
</P>
<P>
Explaining the reason behind the kidnapping, the ex-rebel said
they kidnapped the priest in exchange for the release of
livelihood funds the government promised after signing a peace
agreement with the MNLF in September 1996.
</P>
<P>
"Seemingly, Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM)
governor Nur Misuari and other government officials have forgotten
their promise of new life to us after the signing of a final peace
agreement," he said.
</P>
<P>
MNLF chief Misuari was appointed governor of the ARMM according
to the peace deal.
</P>
<P>
President Fidel Ramos said on Thursday that the safe recovery
of the Irish priest was the paramount concern of the government
and he ordered local officials to take the lead through
negotiations, with the police and the military first staying back.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Wheat Farmers on Strike for Better Price </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Striking wheat farmers has
paralyzed all activities in Eldoret town, west Kenya, as the
farmers blocked all major roads leading to the town, the East
African Standard reported today.
</P>
<P>
They used combine harvesters, lorries, pick-up and other
vehicles to barricade all roads following a meeting held
yesterday morning in the town.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that the farmers who are demanding to be paid
better prices for their wheat vowed to continue with the strike
until their grievances were addressed.
</P>
<P>
They blamed wheat importers, middlemen and millers for the low
prices and complained that a government decision to raise tariffs
on imported wheat from 25 percent to 50 percent came after a lot
of wheat had been imported.
</P>
<P>
The farmers are demanding to be paid 1,800 Kenyan Shillings
(about 30 U.S. Dollars) per 90 kg bag of wheat while the local
millers offered 1,300 Shillings.
</P>
<P>
The millers in the town including the Giant Unga Millers Ltd.
were forced to close down by the farmers last week when they
lowered the prices to 1,100 Shillings per bag.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government announced on October 28 a tariff
increase on imported wheat from 25 percent to 50 percent in order
to protect local farmers from unfair competition.
</P>
<P>
Following the tariff increase, the cost of buying and shipping
a bag of wheat was pushed from 1,100 Shillings to 1,500
Shillings.
</P>
<P>
Since the wheat sector was liberalized in 1993, the Kenyan
government has ceased setting prices for wheat and wheat
products.
</P>
<P>
The annual wheat production in the East African country stands
at 3.5 million bags compared to a demand of about 7 million bags
for local consumption. Kenya has to import more than 3 million
bags of wheat annually to meet the domestic demands.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Officials Caught Driving Stolen Cars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Two Palestinian officials
were arrested this week by Israeli police as they attempted to
enter the self-rule Gaza Strip in stolen cars.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian Legislative Council (PLC) member Moussa Abu Sabha
was caught as he attempted to drive a stolen Mercedes past the
Erez checkpoint Tuesday night. And Thursday morning Israeli
police arrested Palestinian intelligence official Gen. Zacriah
Balusha as he tried to drive a stolen BMW into Gaza.
</P>
<P>
Abu Sabha, who until last year was a member of the
Preventive Security Apparatus of the Palestinian National Authority
(PNA), has a VIP card permitting him free passage between
Israel and the PNA territories. But Israeli police, who knew
that five Mercedes had recently being stolen from a Jerusalem
car lot, checked the car's engine number and found it to be
one of the stolen cars.
</P>
<P>
Abu Sabha claimed he had taken the car to a repair shop
in Ramallah for a friend, and that he did not know the
car was stolen. But he was remanded for five days by the
Jerusalem Magistrate's Court.
</P>
<P>
Balusha was only being driven and said he knew nothing
about the car. He was not held and permitted to cross into
Gaza, but his driver was arrested.
</P>
<P>
PNA Minister of Local Government Saeb Erekat has said that
the PNA and the PLC would investigate the cases and study
the evidences against them and they would be punished if found
guilty.
</P>
<P>
Israeli police said that during the first nine months of
this year, a total of 33,000 vehicles have been stolen in
Israel.

Hashimoto conveyed the message to Yeltsin through Yegor
Stroyev, chairman of Russia's upper house, the Federation Council,
on the eve of his upcoming two-day visit to Krasnoyarsk in
southern Siberia for informal summit talks with Yeltsin, Kyodo
News reported.
</P>
<P>
In a 15-minute meeting with Stroyev, who arrived here Thursday
for a three-day visit, Hashimoto asked the Russian legislator to
convey to Yeltsin his core message that "Whatever happened in this
century, the territorial issue should be put in order within this
century."
</P>
<P>
Noting the two countries have been divided on the issue for
more than five decades, Hashimoto said it is "not something that
can be settled in just two or three days."
</P>
<P>
However, such progress should be made during the coming summit
as setting a direction of resolving the dispute over the islands,
the Prime Minister said.
</P>
<P>
The islands, which were seized by the Soviet Union at the end
of World War Two, are Etorofu, Kunashiri, Shikotan and the Habomai
group of islets.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto also expressed the wishes to see bilateral relations
quickly reach a new stage where a peace treaty can be signed.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have not yet concluded a peace treaty mainly
due to the territorial row.
</P>
<P>
In coincidence, Japanese Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi also
vowed today to seek an early solution to the dispute.
</P>
<P>
"Japan has not decided its boundary with Russia, we would like
to greet the 21st century by solving the issue which arose in the
20th century," Obuchi said.

DAR ES SALAAM, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania has announced
that it would develop three to four gold mines in the next three
years to exploit over 15 million ounces of gold located recently
by explorers.

<HEADLINE> Hanson's Opposition to Aid for Indonesia Could Hurt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Australian Deputy Prime
Minister Tim Fischer today warned that Pauline Hanson's opposition
to aid for Indonesia could hurt Australia's exports.
</P>
<P>
The anti-Asia immigration federal MP yesterday expressed her
opposition to the Australian government's decision to offer what
could be up to 1.1 billion US dollars to contribute to an
International Monetary Fund (IMF) bail-out for Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Final details of the contribution are still being negotiated,
the Australian Financial Review reported today.
</P>
<P>
Fischer said he did not dispute Hanson's right to attack the
IMF contribution.
</P>
<P>
"But if she's sabotaging our exports I equally have the right
to point out that," Fischer, who is also trade minister, said.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted Australian Prime Minister John Howard as
telling parliament yesterday that Australia's participation in the
aid package was in the national interest.
</P>
<P>
"What you have here is a situation where it is in Australia's
national self-interest to have a strong Indonesia capable of
buying goods and services from Australia, capable of sending
tourists to this country and capable of making a contribution in
partnership and in trade with Australia to the strengthening and
the development of the Australian economy", he said in response to
a question from Hanson.
</P>
<P>
Hanson had earlier attacked the government's decision to
contribute about 700 million US dollars to the IMF's financial
assistance package for Thailand.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh to Receive 235m Dollars From WB for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 31 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank (WB) has approved
a 235 million U.S. dollar credit to Bangladesh for a private
sector infrastructure development project, WB sources said here
today.
</P>
<P>
The project would provide both funding and technical assistance
to promote greater private sector participation in power, gas,
water supply, telecommunications and transportation.
</P>
<P>
The credit has been provided by the International Development
Association, the WB's concessionary lending arm.
</P>
<P>
"The project will play a catalytic role in mobilizing
commercial funding for infrastructure development in Bangladesh,"
the sources quoted Vijay Iyer, WB project finance specialist and
project task manager, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Besides gas pipelines, the sub-projects could include new port
facilities, toll roads such as the Dhaka bypass, and a water
treatment plant for the capital city.
</P>
<P>
Sufficient private commercial financing is not available --
primarily due to non-investment grade rating for Bangladesh debt
and the absence of creditworthy public utilities, the sources
pointed out, adding that investors, therefore, seek additional
security for mobilizing market-based funding and supplement it
with sources of long-term financing.
</P>
<P>
The project will address this constraint by establishing a
Private Sector Infrastructure Development Fund. The fund will
provide long-term debt financing for privately-sponsored projects
in infrastructure, according to the sources.
</P>
<P>
The availability of this type of financing will facilitate
better risk-sharing between private sponsors and the government,
and increase the likelihood that projects with a high economic
priority are implemented, the sources added.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh, Canada Strike 18m Dollar Aviation Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 31 (Xinhua) -- A Canadian aircraft company has
struck a 18 million U.S. dollar deal with Bangladesh's GMG
Airlines to support its domestic aviation operations, a local
newspaper reported here today.
</P>
<P>
This is the largest ever direct financing between two private
companies of Canada and Bangladesh, the Financial Express said.
</P>
<P>
The GMG Airlines Limited, a unit of the GMG Group, created this
landmark in attracting foreign direct financing by leasing a
37-seat Dash 8-100 aircraft from Canadian Bombardier Regional
Aircraft Division, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The two companies also have plans to sign one more agreement
within the next few months to lease two Dash 8-300 aircraft valued
at more than 20 million dollars, the newspaper stated, adding that
on completion of the second deal GMG Airlines would have a total
financing package from Bombardier worth 38 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
GMG is expected to start its operation by the middle of January
next year after completing pilot training and other necessary
jobs. The airlines is to use its aircraft as hub bypass
transportation.
</P>
<P>
In a addition to offering six flights a day to common domestic
routes, the newspaper said, it will offer very convenient direct
flights from city pairs, and two such routes which they planned
are Chittagong- Sylhet-Chittagong and
Chittagong-Jessore-Chittagong.
</P>
<P>
"We feel there are enough scope to earn revenue from air
services in Bangladesh and initially we are expecting an annual
revenue of one billion taka (about 21 million dollars)," the
newspaper quoted Chairman of the GMG Airlines Abdus Sattar as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Bombardier, which markets and supports the "de Havilland Dash
8" and "Canadair Regional Jet", is a corporation employing 41,000
people around the world, and its annual revenue is around 8
billion dollars, the newspaper added.

<HEADLINE> World Media Comment on Jiang's U.S. Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 31 (Xinhua) -- The world media continued to
comment on Chinese President Jiang Zemin's on-going visit to the
United States, speaking highly of the Wednesday summit meeting
between Jiang and U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
The Russian newspaper "Sovietskaya Rossiya" (Soviet Russia)
said Tuesday that the first official visit by the top Chinese
leader to the United States in 12 years marks an important
milestone in relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that although the United States tried to
pressurize China on a number of issues in recent years, it ended
up in failing to shake China.
</P>
<P>
It quoted Clinton as saying just before the summit that any
attempt to isolate China was impractical, ineffective and even
dangerous and the United States expected China to be its equal and
strong partner in Asia and other regions of the world.
</P>
<P>
Another Russian newspaper "Izvstia" (News) said Wednesday that
President Jiang Zemin's visit shows China and the United States
are overcoming mistrust between them and looking for a new
equilibrium.
</P>
<P>
The Russian newspaper "Segodnya" (Today) said Thursday that the
summit will help end what it called the political cold period
between the two countries and make American leaders take China
into account.
</P>
<P>
It said it believed China's deepening economic reform and its
friendly relations with Russia and other major countries in the
world had helped China and the United States to have closer ties.
</P>
<P>
The Finnish News Agency said that the first official visit by a
Chinese leader in 12 years is a great achievement in the
development of Sino-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
It said that personal relations between the two leaders,
established through direct contacts, is very important in "big
country politics."
</P>
<P>
It is necessary for the United States to maintain good ties
with China, a big country becoming stronger and stronger, it said.
</P>
<P>
A Finnish television commentary said that although China and
the United States still have differences, President Jiang's visit
was fruitful.
</P>
<P>
A Malaysian newspaper, the Sin Chew Jit Poh, today said the
summit talks between Jiang and Clinton have made "breakthrough and
fruitful achievements".
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian newspaper's editorial said that the greatest
achievement of the summit is that both leaders agreed to hold
regular meetings to realize the long-term target of establishing
"strategic partnership" between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The importance of the summit lies in the fact that the United
States has acknowledged China as a big power and believed it
necessary to meet Chinese leader regularly to help resolve major
international issues, it said.
</P>
<P>
The strategic dialogue between the United States and China,
which will at least play a positive role in maintaining peace and
stability in the Asian-Pacific region, should be welcomed by
countries in the region, the paper said.

<HEADLINE> Historians Say Ruins Suggest Changchun Older Than Listed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Two Chinese historians
believe the automobile industry city of Changchun in northeastern
China's Jilin Province is much older than its listed 197-years-old.
</P>
<P>
The local government established by the central authority of
the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) in 1800 initiated the cultural and
physical founding of the city, historians said at a symposium
focusing on the Changchun's origin.
</P>
<P>
However, some historians disagree and suggest that the city is
much older. Neolithic finds and ruins excavated near the city
showed that primitive people may have inhabited the area 2,000 to
3,000 years ago, said Li Jiancai, a researcher from Jilin Cultural
Relics and Archaeology Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
Other researchers believe the official establishment of the
Fuyu Kingdom (200 B.C.- 494 A.D.), ruled by a minority group, was
adjacent to the area which is the present-day Changchun.

<HEADLINE> Visit to A Resettlement Center on Yangtze River (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YICHANG, October 31 (Xinhua) -- It's more than an hour's ride
out of Fuling, in the newly-created Chongqing Municipality that
used to be the largest city in southwest China, to the Lianfeng
Resettlement Center on the south bank of the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
The 560 km highway from Fuling to Fengdu, a former "ghost
town", zigzags through the mountain shrubbery. Many newly-built
resettlement centers are scattered along the highway. It's late
autumn, but the weather in the mountains and valleys is still as
mild as spring.
</P>
<P>
Groups of farmers can be seen busying themselves with highway
or new house construction. They work hard day and night to finish
the job of resettling the people from the Three Gorges Reservoir
area before next Spring Festival, the traditional Chinese time for
family reunions.
</P>
<P>
An official with the Fuling Resettlement Office says that the
Fuling-Fengdu highway is being built with money from resettlement
funds and other sources. The highway is lined with newly-built
housing for the resettled people, and is referred to by local
people as a "resettlement corridor".
</P>
<P>
Xu Dagui, a farmer who is near 50 and is one of many people to
be relocated, is preparing to build a new house. He says, "A year
ago, I was hesitant about moving to the higher ground from the
dock area where my wife and I earned money down there on the
Yangtze."
</P>
<P>
But, the new resettlement center, with its three-story houses,
tap water, and reclaimed farmland, has caused Xu to change his
mind, and he no longer wants to live in the old run-down wooden
house. He decided to go ahead and move to a designated site along
with his neighbors.
</P>
<P>
When he saw his neighbors' new houses being completed, Xu
started getting worried. So, now, every morning after breakfast,
he starts digging the foundation for his new house. He plans to
use some 20,000 yuan in compensation money for relocation and more
than 10,000 yuan of his own savings to build a three-storey
house.

<HEADLINE> Analysis: Will Baht Fall Lower From its Lowest? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 31 (Xinhua) -- The Thai currency fell past the
psychological barrier of 40 baht to the US dollar on Thursday.
That was, of course, an all-time low.
</P>
<P>
The baht closed at 40.02, down from 39.45 the day before.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank of Thailand reportedly sold 30 million US
dollars to intervene, trying to prop up the Thai currency.
</P>
<P>
But it did not help, as 30 million was too little to sway the
money market, given that the trading volume topped 400 million
dollars on the day. Besides, the central bank no longer had the
resources for a serious major defense.
</P>
<P>
In only four months, the baht has lost 55.1 percent of its
value. Just before the baht was floated on July 2, the mid-rate
was 25.79 to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
Even one month ago, no one imagined that the baht would dive to
such a low level. Many people were optimistic that the 17.2
billion dollar bailout package from the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) would help.
</P>
<P>
The currency weakness on Thursday also dragged down the Stock
Exchange of Thailand (SET), which dropped 12.07 points, or 2.64
percent, to close at 445.09 points, its lowest level since April
4, 1989. The SET index has lost 46 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
What on earth had happened to drag both the baht and the SET
index down?
</P>
<P>
Well, nothing. Just because nothing had happened to shore them
up.
</P>
<P>
There was complete absence of encouraging political and
economic news to push up the currency and the stock market,
analysts say.
</P>
<P>
With Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh's announcement
earlier this month that parliament would possibly be dissolved in
December and general elections held in January, observers do not
see much prospect of clear policy decisions on the part of the
government for the remaining two months of this year.
</P>
<P>
Politicians will be too preoccupied with election preparations
and campaigning. For them, winning a seat in the next parliament
is much more important than achieving any progress in improving
the country's economy, let alone there is not much time left for
the current government to achieve any spectacular accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
Chatichai Choonhavan, leader of the Chart Pattana party and
chief adviser to the prime minister, said on Thursday that
Chavalit should not have made the election timetable known to the
public so early, as foreign investors will sit tight and await the
next government.
</P>
<P>
He said at least 10 big investors had told him that they would
invest in Thailand after a new government is formed.
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what our economy will look like in the next three
to four months if investors continue with their wait-and-see
attitude to our politics," said Chatichai, whose party is the
largest partner in the New Aspiration party-led government.
</P>
<P>
"We can't see the future, and frankly I am very heavy-hearted
about foreign investment," he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, pressure for the prime minister to resign continues
for alleged mismanagement of the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say the nose-dives of the baht and the SET index are
reflection of an all-time low confidence in the country's economy
among both local and foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
"The economy looks hopeless and there is too much political
wrangling," the Bangkok Post today quotes an unnamed currency
trader at a local bank as saying.
</P>
<P>
"We are past 40 now. Resistance next will come around 42. If it
breaks through that, the baht could fall to 45, unless sentiment
picks up," said another dealer, who requested anonymity.
</P>
<P>
However, considering the country's overall political and
economic situation over the next two months, even if there is some
sentiment picking-up, it can by no means be a spectacular one.

<HEADLINE> Visit To A Resettlement Center on Yangtze River (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Xu is just one of the 1.2 million people being resettled as
part of China's massive Three Gorges Project. The project
officially started three years ago, and by September, 82,300
people living along the upper reaches of the Yangtze had left
their old homes and moved to newer ones to make way for the
damming of the river on November 8.
</P>
<P>
Along the resettlement corridor, many people who are part of
the second phase of construction have already moved over to higher
ground ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
Zhao Qirong, who is living in the new Lianfeng Village on the
highway looks more relaxed than Xu, because her family got in
earlier. 27 of the households have finished construction work on
two three-storey housing blocks, and small banyan trees are doing
well out in front of the buildings.
</P>
<P>
In her small grocery store, Zhao is sitting about leisurely on
a rattan sofa watching TV. Business is not as good as it was down
on the riverside, she says.
</P>
<P>
Zhao's family of three used to live in a house with a tar-paper
roof. When the wind blew or the rain came down, the inside of the
house was just like the outside. And, when the flood season began,
the shop had to be moved to higher location.
</P>
<P>
Using the government's relocation funds and savings from
several small businesses over the past decade, Zhao has built a
three-storey house with a floor space of 100 square meters.
</P>
<P>
"It's much better living here in the new house than it was
before," Zhao says, reflecting her pleasure, "when the road is
finished and there is more traffic, business will be good at my
shop."

<HEADLINE> China To Tighten Inspection of Cotton Imports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Measures should be taken to
improve China's cotton industry and control imports, according to
the State Administration for the Inspection of Imports and Exports
(SAIIE).
</P>
<P>
Closely cooperating with consumers and foreign trade
enterprises, the administration wants to halt imports of low-grade
cotton, which has been increasing in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The low-grade cotton accounted for 87 percent of the total
cotton imports in 1996, and that rate had gone up by two percent
in the first half of 1997, government statistics reveal.
</P>
<P>
SAIIE also said imported cotton was short weighed: the amount
imported for 1996 weighed 9,178.8 tons less than claimed.
</P>
<P>
In addtion, some 150,000 tons of imported cotton got way to
China's markets without inspection during the last year and half,
officials said. Customs statistics show that China imported
650,000 tons of cotton in 1996 and 460,000 tons for the first half
of 1997. However, according to SAIIE statistics, actual figures
for imported cotton were 580,000 tons in 1996 and 380,000 tons for
the first six months of 1997.
</P>
<P>
China imported a substantial amount of cotton because the price
of imports is lower, than that produced locally, officials
said. Statistics show the price per ton for locally produced
cotton is 12,000 yuan (1,500 U.S. dollars) higher than imports.
</P>
<P>
To reduce imports and become more competitive in pricing, SAIIE
said the quality of locally produced cotton needs to be improved
while reducing transportation costs.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Newspapers Comment on Jiang's U.S. Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Six leading Japanese newspapers
today positively commented in their editorials on the significance
and achievements of Chinese President Jiang Zemin's state visit to
the United States.
</P>
<P>
Asahi Shimbun said that it was very significant for China and
the United States to reach an agreement on building constructive
strategic partnership, which was warmly welcomed by Japan that
maintained friendly ties with both Beijing and Washington. The
Sino-U.S. cooperation would certainly play a bigger role in
settling international conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Yomiuri Shimbun said that Jiang's visit ushered in a new era of
Sino-U.S. relations. The summit talks could be viewed as a
handshake between the two countries in a bid to establish a stable
world order oriented to the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Nihon Keizai Shimbun said that President Jiang's U.S. visit
shows that the two countries "try to find their common points and
establish a new world order."
</P>
<P>
Since the international issues that cannot be settled without
the two countries' cooperation are increasing, the Sino-U.S.
summit is already beyond bilateral talks in this sense, the
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The agreement to set up a hotline and hold regular meetings
between heads of the two states are concrete achievements of this
summit, the newspaper added.
</P>
<P>
Mainichi Shimbun said that President Jiang's visit has built a
new bridge between Beijing and Washington, which will preduce
great influence on the international politics.
</P>
<P>
Sankai Shimbun said that Jiang's official visit to the
U.S. itself has great significance.
</P>
<P>
Tokyo Shimbun said the talks between the two presidents have
set a new orientation for China and the U.S. and the visit was
held in a business-like manner, which was worth welcoming.

<P>
CANBERRA, October 31 (Xinhua) -- The security chief of the
Sydney Olympic Games Paul McKinnon said on Thursday that security
procedures on Sydney's public transport should be reinforced to
avoid any terrorist incidents at the 2000 Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
The police disclosed on Thursday that a bomb was found on
a ferry from Manly to Sydney harbour six weeks ago, they asked the
public for help with their investgations.
</P>
<P>
McKinnon said Olympic preparations had to ensure "standard
operating procedures are applied in a way that reflects the
international focus and responds to a whole range of threats.
</P>
<P>
New South Wales state Olympics Minister Michael Knight said
security procedures for the games would be examined following the
ferry bomb case.
</P>
<P>
In the first six months of this year, a series of chemical bomb
attacks have left more than 30 people injured across Sydney's

<HEADLINE> Lithuania Rejects Russian Proposal on Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 30 (Xinhua) -- The Lithuanian Foreign Ministry
today rejected a proposal on security made by Russian President
Boris Yeltsin to the three Baltic nations.
</P>
<P>
A ministry statement released today in Vilnius, Capital of
Lithuania, said Lithuania's security policy is based on
good-neighborliness and integration with Europe and the
trans-Atlantic organization.
</P>
<P>
It said neither one-sided security guarantee nor regional one
could guarantee the security of Europe or the security of
Lithuania, the Itar-Tass reported.
</P>
<P>
The Russian-Lithuanian relationship is based on the agreement
signed between them in 1991, so it is not necessary for them to
sign a new security document or a regional agreement, the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
It also said Lithuania is still interested in developing
mutually beneficial cooperation with Russia to solve specific
economic, social and ecological problems, and in political
dialogue.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that agreements between Russia and Lithuania
on preventing dual-taxation and encouraging and protecting
investment will further promote the development of bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin proposed last Friday when meeting with his visiting
Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas that Russia sign a
security guarantee agreement with each of the three Baltic
countries (Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia) or an agreement with the
three countries to ensure the security of the area.

<TEXT>
<P>
We will build a national, scientific and popular socialist
culture that is geared to modernization, the world and the future,
and endeavor to raise the ideological, ethical, scientific and
educational standards of the whole nation. At the same time, we
should conduct multi-formed cultural exchanges with other
countries, drawing on their strong points while introducing our
own achievements to the world.
</P>
<P>
What the Congress has achieved has given expression to the
common desire of the Chinese people of all ethnic groups. The
Congress, as commented by world opinion, sent out an unequivocal
message: China's reform and opening-up is irreversible. This
judgment is correct.
</P>
<P>
The current situation in China is very good as demonstrated,
among others, by the rapid growth of the national economy. This
year, the GDP is expected to grow by about nine percent while
inflation has been brought under effective control. China is now
opening wider to the outside world and, as the investment
environment continues to improve, the number of overseas investors
already exceeds 290,000. The total amount of foreign capital
actually used by China has topped 200 billion U.S. dollars, making
it the second largest country in attracting overseas
investment. China now enjoys social stability with all-round
progress in its social undertakings. Many foreign friends see
China as becoming one of the most dynamic regions in the
world. Despite our impressive performance, as the biggest
developing country in the world, we are still faced with a
multitude of difficulties and challenges which call for continued
efforts.
</P>
<P>
The one hundred years between the middle of the nineteenth
century and the middle of the twentieth century began with the
Chinese people suffering from humiliation and bullying and ended
with their achieving national independence and liberation after
strenuous struggles. The one hundred years from the middle of this
century to the middle of the next century began with the birth of
New China and will end, as we will see, with the Chinese people
succeeding, through hard work, in building a strong and prosperous
country, achieving national rejuvenation and securing a happy life
for themselves. Such are the earth-shaking changes and gigantic
historic progress that China has witnessed and is about to witness
in these two centuries.
</P>
<P>
Respecting man's dignity and value is a time-honored virtue of
the Chinese people. "Nothing holds more value and is more
dignified in the universe than human beings" and "The benevolent
is kind toward the people". These ideas advocated by ancient sages
have a deep-seated influence in Chinese society. Human rights as
enjoyed by the Chinese people today have never been as
extensive. As a developing country of 1.2 billion people, China's
very reality determines that the right to subsistence and
development is the most fundamental and most important human right
in China. Before adequate food and clothing is ensured for the
people, the enjoyment of other rights would be out of the
question. During the past twenty years or so, the number of people
living below the poverty line in China has dropped by nearly 200
million, providing a necessary material condition for better
enjoyment of rights by the people.

<TEXT>
<P>
Human rights are of universal significance. Given the fact that
there are so many countries in the world, the realization of human
rights must be based on the efforts of the countries. Therefore,
the issue of human rights is essentially a subject matter within a
country's sovereignty. Human rights come as a product of history,
and their full realization requires an evolutionary process which
must tally with a country's economic and cultural development
levels. Collective and individual human rights, economic, social
and cultural rights and civil and political rights are inseparable
from one another. The Chinese government takes upon itself the
task to protect human rights according to law and oppose all
activities violating the lawful rights of its citizens. It has
made unremitting efforts to this end. As things stand now, China
has acceded to seventeen international human rights instruments
and has recently signed the International Covenant on Economic,
Social and Cultural Rights. Different views held by countries on
the human rights issue ought to be addressed through dialogue, and
confrontation should be avoided. China is ready to keep up
exchanges and cooperation with other countries in a continued
effort to promote human rights throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has always endeavored to protect the
rights and interests of ethnic minorities in accordance with the
Constitution. Regional autonomy is practiced in places where
ethnic minorities live in compact communities. All ethnic groups
are free to use and develop their own spoken and written languages
as well as to keep and reform their own customs. Chinese citizens
have the freedom of religious belief. Inter-ethnic relations
characterized by equality, unity and mutual assistance have
further solidified, and the process toward common development and
common prosperity of all ethnic groups has visibly accelerated.
</P>
<P>
I wish to emphasize here that the establishment and development
of the socialist system in China has enabled some ethnic groups to
leap over certain stages of social development. For example, until
the democratic reform of 1959, Tibet was a feudal-serfdom, a
theocracy with a heavy taint of slavery. The serfs, bond servants
to their masters, had no human rights whatsoever to speak of. It
was our democratic reform that emancipated some one million serfs
and slaves through peaceful means. This, similar to the liberation
of black slaves in American history, represented a great social
change and advance. Historical advances as such cannot be rolled
back. With the support of the central government and the rest of
the country, today's Tibet is developing prosperously and people
there are living and working in happiness and contentment.

<P>
The basic goal of our foreign policy is to maintain and promote
world peace and stability. China is, and will always be, a staunch
force working for the maintenance of world peace. China's defense
policy is of a defensive nature and our military spending is the
lowest among major countries. In addition to the unilateral troop
reduction by one million men in the eighties, China has recently
announced that it will cut back its military force by another
500,000 men in the next three years. As China becomes more and
more developed with its people leading a better life, it can only
promote world peace and stability rather than pose a threat to
anyone. China will never seek hegemony even after it becomes a
developed country in the future. On the contrary, should
development elude China and its 1.2 billion people remain in
poverty, should the country fail to maintain stability or even be
plunged into social turmoil, this, as Mr. Deng Xiaoping once
pointed out, would represent not only bad luck for China but also
a disaster of global proportion.
</P>
<P>
With the advent of a new century, mankind has found itself at a
historical juncture. Opting for peace and stability and promoting
cooperation and development, this has become the theme of our
times. Though factors making for durable peace are on the rise,
the world is not free from troubles. World peace remains
threatened as the old unfair and irrational international economic
order is yet to be fundamentally transformed. Local conflicts
break out from time to time. Environmental degradation, arms
proliferation, international crime, terrorism and other
cross-border issues have presented new challenges to
mankind. People from all lands are expecting the 21st century as a
century full of hopes. This historic subject is now put before the
leaders of all countries, including those of China and the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Yesterday, President Clinton and I held talks where we had an
in-depth exchange of views on how to establish a constructive and
strategic partnership between China and the United States oriented
towards the 21st century. The meeting yielded important
achievements. This marks a good beginning in the establishment and
development of such a partnership.
</P>
<P>
The journey China-U.S. relations have gone through in the past
fifty years or so has not been smooth sailing. It was punctuated
with estrangement and contacts, confrontation and cooperation,
friction and harmony. A review of the past tells us that further
progress in China-U.S. relations hinges on correctly understanding
our common interests and properly handling our differences. We all
desire to maintain peace, stability and prosperity in the
Asia-Pacific region and the world at large. We all want to prevent
the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. We all endeavor
to promote the establishment of an open and sound international
trade regime. We all feel the need to deal with a multitude of
transnational issues of common concern. And we are all interested
in increased exchanges and cooperation in wide-ranging areas. As
permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, China and the
United States have on their shoulders a crucial responsibility for
peace and security in the world.

<P>
On the basis of clear recognition of our common interests and
responsibility, we should summarize the past and look into the
future and lay down a number of guidelines for our relationship
oriented towards the 21st century. These guidelines are: 1. To
view and handle China-U.S. relations from a strategic and
long-term perspective and keep a firm grip on the overall interest
of bilateral relations. 2. To vigorously seek the converging point
of the common interests, taking into account not only one's own
interest but also that of the other side. 3. To scrupulously abide
by the three China-U.S. joint communiques which form the basis of
a growing relationship. 4. To correctly handle the differences
through consultation on an equal footing in the spirit of mutual
respect and seeking common ground while putting aside
differences. 5. To handle the Taiwan question properly. The
U.S. government has reiterated on many occasions its commitment to
the "one China" policy and the three joint communiques. As much as
we appreciate that, we hope these words will count and be followed
by productive actions.
</P>
<P>
When China and the United States moved to establish diplomatic
relations, the U.S. government made a decision to sever diplomatic
ties with Taiwan, withdraw American troops from there and abrogate
the treaties it had signed with the regime. This was a wise and
politically farsighted decision which served the interests of both
countries and world peace. The question of Taiwan has always been
the single most important and most sensitive issue at the heart of
China-U.S. relations. Whenever trouble crops up there, the
relationship will stagnate or even suffer setbacks. Unlike Hong
Kong and Macao, Taiwan is an issue left over from the struggle
between the Chinese Communist Party and the Kuomintang. Its
resolution is entirely an internal affair of China and should be
worked out by the Chinese people on both sides of the Straits. The
basic policy of the Chinese government for the settlement of the
Taiwan question is "peaceful reunification based on one country,
two systems."
</P>
<P>
We have already made a solemn appeal to the other side of the
Straits that the two sides can hold negotiations and conclude an
agreement on officially ending the state of hostility in
accordance with the principle that there is only one China. On
that basis, the two sides can undertake jointly to maintain
China's sovereignty and territorial integrity and formulate plans
for future development of cross-straits relations. So long as the
Taiwan authorities return to the one China principle and refrain
from separatist activities aimed at the "independence of Taiwan,"
and so long as foreign forces do not interfere with China's
reunification, the situation in the Taiwan Straits will remain
stable and cross-straits relations will move forward smoothly.
</P>
<P>
Both China and the United States are great nations and their
people great people. In the past, we have made our respective
contributions to the advancement of human civilization. Today, in
response to the demand of the times, we should make fresh
contributions to world peace, development and progress.

<P>
Thank you.

<HEADLINE> Pak Supreme Court Directs President to Notify Judge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 31 (Xinhua) -- The Supreme Court of Pakistan
has issued directives to President Farooq Leghari to notify the
appointment of five judges to the apex court in accordance with
the recommendations of Chief Justice Sajjad Ali Shah.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has written a letter to
the president advising him not to take any action on the order
issued by the chief justice as it is "not legally enforceable".
</P>
<P>
According to official sources, a three-member bench, headed by
Chief Justice Sajjad Ali Shah, accepted on Thursday two
constitutional petitions filed under Article 190 of the
constitution.
</P>
<P>
In both the constitutional petitions, the petitioners asked the
court to issue directives to the president to notify the
appointment of judges.
</P>
<P>
"Since the legal position with regard to the appointments is
very clearly stated in the relevant articles of the constitution,
a request is made to the president to render assistance under
Article 190, which contemplates that all executive and judicial
authorities throughout Pakistan shall act in aid of the Supreme
Court," reads the judgment of the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
The three-member bench passed the short order after three hours
of hearings on the two petitions, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court of Pakistan Wednesday suspended the operation
of the 14th Amendment to the Constitution (the Anti-Defection
Law), which was passed by both houses of the Parliament
unanimously early July this year.
</P>

the government and the judiciary are trying to resolve the

The National Assembly on Wednesday held a special session and
adopted a resolution reiterating supremacy of the Parliament over
all other organs of the state and vowed to protect its
constitutional authority of amending the constitution.
</P>
<P>
At the same day, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said the
suspension of the 14th Amendment, which was enacted in line with
the aspirations of the nation to root out the curse of
horse-trading, has again opened the way for "politics of money".
</P>
<P>
He called the suspension "unconstitutional", saying the
Parliament would solve the issue by "playing its constitutional
role".

<P>
WASHINGTON, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang
Zemin who is on a nine-day state visit to the United States
delivered a speech at a luncheon hosted by the America-China
Society and five other organizations. Full text of the speech
reads as follows:

Mr. Conable,
Dr. Kissinger,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
</P>
<P>
It gives me great pleasure to get together with you at today's
luncheon hosted by the America-China Society, the National
Committee on U.S.-China Relations, the U.S.-China Policy
Foundation, the Council on Foreign Relations, the Asia Society and
the Committee of 100. Over the years, you have made positive
contributions to deeper understanding and friendship between the
Chinese and American peoples. Allow me to express, on behalf of
the Chinese Government and people, our heartfelt thanks to you and
our deep gratitude and best regards to all our American friends
who have cared for and supported the improvement and growth of
China-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
Now, let me take this opportunity to brief you on China's
domestic and foreign policies and share with you some of my
thoughts on China-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
China has gone through quite a few extraordinary events since
the beginning of the year. On February 19, Mr. Deng Xiaoping, the
chief architect of our reform and opening-up program, passed
away. The Chinese people of all ethnic groups cherished a profound
memory of this great man, and were determined to carry forward
unswervingly his unfinished cause. On July 1, the Chinese
Government resumed the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong,
wiping out the century-old humiliation caused by its occupation
and succeeded in maintaining Hong Kong's prosperity and stability
in accordance with the policy of "one country, two systems," "Hong
Kong people administering Hong Kong" and a high degree of
autonomy. In the middle of September, the Communist Party of China
convened its Fifteenth National Congress, whose main theme was to
promote an all-round advancement of the cause of building
socialism with Chinese characteristics to the 21st century by
holding high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory. This
Congress also clearly answered the important question as to how
China's reform, opening-up and modernization drive will go forward.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Approves New Loan for Bulgaria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 30 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank today
approved a loan of 100 million U.S. dollars for financial and
enterprise sector adjustment in Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
The loan will provide fast-disbursing funds for balance of
payment assistance in support of the country's wide-range economic
reforms in enterprise and financial sectors.
</P>
<P>
"Bulgaria has paid a high price for the slow implementation of
structural reforms, with hardly any growth in 1994 and 1995 and a
decline of 10.9 percent in 1996," noted Hans O. Morritz, the
project manager.
</P>
<P>
The loan is "part of the World Bank's package of support for
reform and improvement in social protection and will help Bulgaria
to enhance prospects of economic growth and promote private
initiative."
</P>
<P>
The project is designed to help reduce losses and impose
financial discipline in state-owned enterprises, accelerate
privatization of state-owned enterprises and assist the
privatization of public sector banks to develop a sound
market-based banking system.
</P>
<P>
Since Bulgaria joined the World Bank in 1990, the Bank's
commitments to the country have totaled 1 billion U.S. dollars for
14 projects.

<HEADLINE> Russia Finishes Integration of Rocket Forces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Russia has completed the
integration of its rocket forces, military space forces and
anti-missile defense forces, the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Vladimir Yakovlev, general commander of the newly integrated
strategic rocket forces, made the announcement to the Russian
agency today.
</P>
<P>
Integration has been made in the organization and command
system and ways have been found to best perform its functions, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Through integration, he added, overlapping organizations were
cut, which will annually reduce the expenses by 60 billion rouble
(10.3 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the quick response capabilities of the rocket forces
have been greatly strengthened with the help of the reconnaissance
system from the anti-missile defense forces.
</P>
<P>
The integration move started in July in line with a reform plan
presented by Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, Russia's future armed forces comprise the air
defense forces, general forces and space rocket forces. The future
air defense forces consist of the present air force and air
defense forces, while general forces consist of the army and the
navy.
</P>
<P>
The new strategic rocket forces and some arms of the air force
and the air defense forces will be combined to form the space
rocket forces.
</P>
<P>
The military reorganization is expected to complete by 2005.

<TEXT>
<P>
Between now and the end of the first decade of the next
century, we will work to establish a fairly ideal socialist market
economy while maintaining a sustained, rapid and sound development
of the national economy so as to lay a solid foundation for basic
achievement of modernization by the middle of the next century.
</P>
<P>
After reviewing our experience of the past and present, we made
it clear that keeping public ownership in the dominant position
while allowing diverse forms of ownership to develop side by side
is a basic economic system that we must always adhere to in the
primary stage of socialism. Public ownership can take diversified
forms, and all management methods and organizational styles that
embody the laws of socialized production, such as the joint stock
system and the joint stock partnership, should be utilized without
hesitation. The non-public sector is an important component of our
socialist market economy, and we should continue to encourage and
guide its sound development.
</P>
<P>
Along the line of establishing a modern enterprise system, we
will accelerate the reform of state-owned enterprises, giving
greater play to their dominant role in the national economy and
quickening the market-oriented reform of the national economy with
better play of the basic role of the marketplace in the allocation
of resources and improved mechanism of macro-control. We will
continue to readjust and optimize the economic structure and stick
to the strategies of revitalizing the nation through science and
education and sustainable development. We will further improve our
pattern of openness which is all-directional, multi-leveled and
wide-ranging, develop an open economy and open China still wider
to the outside world. We will ensure that our people will reap the
benefit of continued economic growth and gradually achieve common
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
We will further enlarge democracy, run the state according to
law and turn China into a socialist country ruled by law. Little
more than 2,000 years ago, ancient Chinese came up with such plain
ideas of democracy and the rule of law as "people being essential
to a state while their governance following prescribed
laws". Today, these thoughts have been further developed to
reflect the new times. We believe that without democracy there can
be no modernization. We will ensure that our people hold
democratic elections, make policy decisions democratically, carry
out democratic management and supervision, and enjoy extensive
rights and freedoms under the law while giving greater play to
their creativity and their sense of being the masters of state
affairs. We will continue to safeguard the dignity of the
Constitution and other laws, further improve the legal system,
strengthen supervision of government organs and leading officials
at all levels to ensure that all work of the country is carried
out according to law. The overall goal of our political
restructuring is to build socialist democracy with Chinese
characteristics while upholding and improving our basic political
system.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Newspaper Speaks Highly of U.S.-China Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, October 30 (Xinhua) -- China Press, an influential
Chinese-language newspaper in the United States, today carried an
editorial highly praising Wednesday's summit between visiting
Chinese President Jiang Zemin and his U.S. counterpart, Bill
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
The editorial described the summit as not only an important
milestone in the history of Sino-U.S. relations but also crucial
for the course of world history.
</P>
<P>
Both China and the United States had gained much in rewards for
a meeting with "complete success", the article said.
</P>
<P>
It said the meeting reflected the China-proposed principle of
avoiding confrontation, reducing disputes, enhancing understanding
and promoting cooperation for the development of the bilateral
relationship.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the meeting also followed the principle
proposed by Washington that relations between the two countries
should not be dominated by one single issue.
</P>
<P>
The meeting helped check the negative factor and promoted a
positive influence in the development of relations between the
United States and China, the article said.
</P>
<P>
The agreements reached by the two presidents during the summit
were of great importance for the future development of bilateral
relations in all fields, as well as for the promotion and creation
of common interests for peoples of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
These agreements also paved the way for the two countries to
develop a strategic relationship, which would be crucial for world
peace and development in the coming century.
</P>
<P>
The development of a state-to-state relationship takes time. To
make the process a smooth one, the two sides should contribute
joint efforts in pace with each other, the editorial said.
</P>
<P>
It also urged Washington to honor the commitments it made in
the three China-U.S. joint communiques, and try to make up for its
poor understanding of present day China.
</P>
<P>
United States statesmen and press media of foresight and
sagacity, should do more positive work to help U.S. people know
more about China, the editorial said.
</P>
<P>
It also mentioned Clinton's planned China tour next year. To
prepare for that, there should be more contacts and exchanges
between the two governments and legislative bodies, the article
added.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Economy Benefits From Capital Inflows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, October 31 (Xinhua) -- A 98 percent rise in net
capital inflows during the first eight months of this year has
boosted the Sri Lankan economy, the local press quoted the Central
Bank as saying today.
</P>
<P>
Due to the surge of capital inflows, Sri Lanka was able to
achieve a balance of payments surplus of 375 million U.S. dollars
as against a deficit of 33 million dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
The rise of net capital inflows from 288 million dollars in the
corresponding period last year to 569 million dollars as of August
this year was mainly due to the increased privatization proceeds
and improvement in government's foreign aid utilization, the bank
said.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank expects the total capital inflows to exceed
one billion dollars by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
Balance of payments is also expected to register a significant
improvement from a deficit of 134 million dollars to a surplus of
412 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Despite a rise in export, however, the trade deficit has been
widened from 792 million dollars to 921 million dollars due to
high import of intermediate and capital goods during the period,
the bank said.
</P>
<P>
Exports from January to August reached 2.9 billion dollars, an
increase of 11.6 percent over the corresponding period last year.
</P>
<P>
In the mean time, imports increased by 12.7 percent to reach
3.9 billion dollars, leading to a rise of 16.3 percent in trade
deficit.
</P>
<P>
The bank also said the current account deficit widened to 297
million dollars from 271 million dollars the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The performance of the external sector is expected to improve
further during the rest of the year. Total industrial exports are
expected to grow by 18 percent in foreign currency terms,
according to the bank.

<HEADLINE> PNG Drought Much Worse Than Expected: Australian FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Australian Foreign Minister
Alexander Downer today said the Papua New Guinean (PNG) drought
was much worse than he had expected, and Australia would do
everything it could to try to prevent lives from being lost.
</P>
<P>
"I'm very worried about the drought situation in Papua New
Guinea," Downer told Australian Broadcasting Corporation radio.
</P>
<P>
"It's turned out to be a good deal worse than initially I
imagined it would be."
</P>
<P>
"The drought assessment team we had up there estimates that
around 500,000 people are being quite seriously affected by the
drought and 100,000 are in dire straits and reminds me that we've
got to do everything that we possibly can to help."
</P>
<P>
The drought will be one of the major topics at today's annual
Australia/PNG ministerial forum in Papua New Guinea being attended
by Downer and other senior ministers.
</P>
<P>
Australia has already contributed around 3 million Australian
dollars (2.1 million US dollars) in drought aid as well as three
Australian military transport aircraft and three Blackhawk
helicopters to ferry aid to severely affected remote areas.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientists Make Nucleic Acid Tonic From Plants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have
developed a technique to extract nucleic acid from plant cells and
to use as tonic to help nutrition and improve health.
</P>
<P>
Nucleic acid is called the "source of life" because it exists
in all living things and contains the basic code of living
things. Nucleic acid bio-technology is a major part of genetic
engineering.
</P>
<P>
The discovery was made by the Dalian Tianhe Nucleic Acid
Science Development Corporation in Dalian, in northeast China's
Liaoning Province. It paves the way for large-scale development of
nucleic acid products by providing inexpensive raw material for
nucleic acid tonics. The direct extraction can avoid possible
industrial pollution.
</P>
<P>
Experts said the nucleic acid content in the tonics can be 14.3
percent.
</P>
<P>
Chen Yusong, chairman of the Dalian company, said they have
decided to put 250 million yuan (30 million dollars) into a
nucleic acid production base in the city. The base is designed to
turn out 6,000 tons of nucleic acid tonics a year by the end of
the century.

<HEADLINE> IMF Aid Package to Indonesia to Be Sealed by Weekend </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 31 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government will
soon announce the outcome of negotiations between Indonesian
officials and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) team for a
financial package to restore market confidence in the country's
economy, a senior official said.
</P>
<P>
"We will announce it at the right time, hopefully soon,"
Minister of Finance Mar'ie Muhammad said here last night.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts predicted the government would announced details
and conditions of the IMF-led financial assistance by the weekend
or next Monday.
</P>
<P>
Former finance minister Radius Prawiro, one of Indonesia's
negotiators, said that negotiations should be completed by the
weekend, Antara news agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
Radius also said Indonesia's economy would recover once the
government restored market confidence with IMF's assistance.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, economist Nyoman Moena said that the IMF package
would send a strong positive sentiment, not only to Indonesia, but
also to the entire Southeast Asian region which has been badly hit
by the current monetary crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian rupiah has dropped by about 50 percent against
the US dollar since the beginning of this year, the worst hit in
Southeast Asian region.
</P>
<P>
On October 8, the Indonesian government decided to seek
long-term loans from international monetary bodies, including the
IMF. Indonesia and IMF started their negotiations on October 10.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has bilateral aid commitments from Malaysia,
Singapore, Japan and Australia. Only Malaysia has said its aid
would be outside the IMF package.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia has committed one billion US dollars and Singapore, 10
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the negotiations said the IMF financial
package would not exceed 10 billion dollars.

<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, October 30 (Xinhua) -- The Serbian minister in charge
of state-sector privatization, Milan Beko, said today that the
Serbian Economic Privatization Law is to come into effect on
October 31, the Tanjug news agency of Yugoslavia reported.
</P>
<P>
Beko said privatization would take at least five years to
complete.
</P>
<P>
In the first two years, 80 percent of state and social
enterprises will be privatized and over four million people will
be involved in the process.
</P>
<P>
Serbia will categorize state and social enterprises and
privatize them in different stages by selling their assets in the
form of shares to domestic and foreign investors, as stipulated in
the law.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavian statistics say 4,000 enterprises are to privatized,
with a total of 66.42 billion U.S. dollars worth of state and
social assets to be sold.
</P>
<P>
The privatization law was passed by the Assembly of the

<P>
BANGKOK, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's automotive industry
will lay off about 30,000 workers next year when sales will
plummet by an estimated 33 percent, according to Toyota Motor
Thailand Co.
</P>
<P>
Automobile sales next year are expected to reach 240,000 units,
or perhaps as low as 180,000 units, Ninnart Chaithirapinyo, the
company's senior managing director, was quoted today by local
press as saying.
</P>
<P>
Toyota, the market leader, expects total sales by all companies
this year to reach 360,000 units. Last year, more than 500,000
vehicles were sold nationwide.
</P>
<P>
Ninnart predicted that the industry would need to lay off at
least 30,000 workers next year because of the slowdown in domestic
sales.
</P>
<P>
During the first nine months of this year, total vehicle sales
reached 322,427, a decline of 26 percent compared with the same
period last year.

<HEADLINE> Ecological Education in Poland Proves Rewarding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Years of efforts by the Polish
government to carry out nationwide ecological education have led
to an improved environment.
</P>
<P>
The project that aims to raise the people's environmental
awareness carries the theme that "whoever pollutes the environment
should finance environmental protection facilities."
</P>
<P>
The 1997 environment report released by Poland's Central Bureau
for Statistics said that more than 2,400 water purification
stations were constructed from 1990 to 1996. A total of 5.6
million cubic meters of polluted water is purified daily.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, escape canals for surface water drainage were
reduced by 55 percent.
</P>
<P>
Poland has scant water resources. Its surface water per capita
last year was 1,600 cubic meters while that in Europe averaged
4,600 cubic meters, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Only 43 percent of Polish residents have access to purified
water while in the whole of Europe the percentage is much higher,
up to 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
A 1996 survey on 84 percent of the rivers in Poland showed that
first-grade quality water accounted for only 5 percent while 33
percent of the water was rated substandard.
</P>
<P>
Despite the improvement in water quality and environment, much
remains to be done for the country to reach the average European
level, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Paraguayan Commandos Storm Oviedo's Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Military commandos today
stormed the residence of Paraguay's retired general and alleged
coup plotter, Lino Oviedo, in Asuncion, the capital of Paraguay,
but failed to find him.
</P>
<P>
One of the main collaborators of the general was wounded in the
attack, which occurred at 4:20 pm local time.
</P>
<P>
Other details of the situation inside the house were still
unknown and Oviedo has not been located.
</P>
<P>
Oviedo, a former army chief who stepped down under pressure in
1996 after an aborted bid to depose President Juan Carlos Wasmosy,
is running for the 1998 presidential election as the candidate of
Paraguay's largest party, the Colorado Party.
</P>
<P>
Wasmosy issued an order to arrest Oviedo earlier in October
after the latter declared at a Buenos Aires press conference that
the Paraguayan government was "crawling with thieves."
</P>
<P>
But the detention order, saying that Oviedo had made statements
against the commander-in-chief and failed to live up to military
ethics, was struck down by Judge Menor Blanca Florentin.
</P>
<P>
The judge argued that Oviedo, as a retired general, was no
longer obliged to live up to a military code of conduct.
</P>
<P>
The arrest order finally came after the Supreme Court decided
that it would in fact apply its conviction of Oviedo for sedition
for leading a failed coup on April 22, 1996. The ruling had been
stayed for the past eight months.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang
Zemin's talks with US President Bill Clinton were described here
today by leading Australian newspapers as "historic", and laying
"solid groundwork for a turnaround in the US-China" relationship.
</P>
<P>
In an editorial published today, the Australian, the largest
national newspaper in the country, said that "the commitment of
the two leaders to hold regular summits" as part of the progress
towards a constructive strategic partnership "cannot be anything
other than a major plus for world peace."
</P>
<P>
In its front-page report on the summit with a color picture of
the two smiling presidents at yesterday's press conference, the
newspaper said "Presidents Bill Clinton and Jiang Zemin have
declared their determination to co-operate" in a new constructive
strategic partnership at a historic summit meeting.
</P>
<P>
In its conclusion, the editorial said "any improvement in
US-China relations can only benefit Australia in the long term."
</P>
<P>
The Australian Financial Review, the country's leading
financial newspaper with extensive coverage of world affairs, said
today the presidents of China and the United States "have laid
solid groundwork for a turnaround in the US-China relationship."
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said Richard Haas, director of Foreign Policy at
the Brookings Institution, was positive about the outcome of the
summit.
</P>
<P>
"The summit itself was not important: it is what the summit
leads to. The institutionalization of the relationship and
continued contact is what is important," said the director.
</P>
<P>
The Sydney Morning Herald, another major national newspaper,
also carried a story on the summit on the front-page with a big
color picture featuring the two presidents at yesterday's press
conference.

MANAGUA, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Nicaraguan President Arnoldo
Aleman said today there will be a record harvest this year and the
economic measures taken by the government in April have achieved
desired results.
</P>
<P>
Aleman told reporters that Nicaragua has a surplus of more than
50,000 quintals of beans and corn despite the El Nino phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
"We say with pride that we have a surplus of basic grains to
the degree that we have exported to El Salvador and the Dominican
Republic," he said.
</P>
<P>
Aleman added that during the past nine months his government
succeeded in reducing inflation, increasing bank deposits and
creating jobs in the rural area.
</P>
<P>
Inflation in September was reduced by half to 3.3 percent from
the same period last year and the bank deposits have increased by
52 percent.
</P>
<P>
Aleman, who was elected president in January, admitted however
that serious financial problems still exist and the foreign debt
is a heavy burden.
</P>
<P>
"We must have clean public finances, which means a balance
between what is obtained as tax revenue and what is spent," said
the president.
</P>
<P>
He added that healthy public finances assure Nicaragua a
substantial reduction of its foreign debt and a channel of
resources toward social spending in education and public health.

LONDON, October 30 (Xinhua) -- A meeting between
representatives of the Football Association (FA) and Professional
Footballers' Association (PFA) and youth development officers from
leading clubs is expeted to be held early in the New Year, aiming
to attract more Asian youths to play first-class football.
</P>
<P>
Football has a large following in Asia at an amateur level, and
now there is no Asian player in an English professional first
team.
</P>
<P>
Former West Brom star and PFA deputy chief executive Brendon
Batson said: "We need to encourage Asian youths that there is no
glass ceiling on their footballing ambitions.
</P>
<P>
Batson also said a new campaign named "Kick It Out" was
launched at Arsenal's Highbury stadium in order to stamp out
racist abuse from English grounds and playing fields.
</P>
<P>
Attending the launch Chris Smith, the Secretary of State for
Sport, Culture and the Media, said that if racist attitudes could
be eliminated from the sport, the battle against racism as a whole
would come a long way.

<HEADLINE> China To Fast Track Developing Technology Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 31 (Xinhua) -- China is fast tracking
development of its technology markets to ensure they meet
international standard, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The process will involve State autorization of additional
research institutes, technological firms and higher education
institutions with independent rights to conduct foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
More than 200 Chinese research institutes have been opened to
overseas businesses in the past few years, with State-granted
approval to trade in technological products.
</P>
<P>
These firms have played a vital role in linking domestic and
overseas technology markets, Song Jian, State councillor and
minister in charge of State Science and Technology Commission,
said during a recent conference in Beijing. The event marked the
10-year anniversary of the Law of Technology Contracts.
</P>
<P>
Technology markets should open further to urban and rural
areas, especially medium- and small-sized firms, township
enterprises and agricultural sectors, which are important parts of
China's economic sectors, but requiring updated technology, said
Song.
</P>
<P>
Protection of intellectual property rights, he added, should be
enhanced during the trading of technological products.
</P>
<P>
China began enforcing the Law of Technology contracts in 1987,
to regulate domestic markets and provide a legislative basis for
co-operation among domestic and overseas enterprises, research
institutes and post-secondary institutions.

<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Businesses in the Tibet
Autonomous Region of China are bringing more name-brand products
into the area.
</P>
<P>
The region started a new product development project with 50
million yuan (six million US dollars) in financial aid, local
officials say. Unlike the past, when state funds were used for
economic expansion, 53 percent of business funding comes from
money they raised themselves; 39 percent comes from bank loans,
and only 8 percent from state appropriation.
</P>
<P>
The local government has put 17 million yuan into technological
innovations this year , a 13.3 percent increase over 1996. Recent
investment has focused on animal by-products, farm produce, solar
energy, and mineral resources, a shift from the simple technology
of a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
Most of these market-oriented products have gained instant
recognition. Zhufeng motorcycles, Lhasa carpets, Lhasa beer,
Zhufeng tea, and Qizheng Tibetan herbs are now readily available
throughout the rest of the country.

"The network is to combine the advanced data technology with
modern education, to promote the development of education and to
establish a new form of public education," said educators and
researchers who set up the network.
</P>
<P>
They added that the network provides special services such as
lessons by famous teachers, e-mail exchanges between network
users, and information on school administration and evaluating
teaching skills.

<P>
KIEV, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Bulgarian Prime Minister Ivan
Kostov Thursday started a two-day official visit to Ukraine with a
view to boosting bilateral relations, particularly trade ties.
</P>
<P>
"Ukraine is a very important partner to Bulgaria," Kostov said
on arrival.
</P>
<P>
He said that his current visit to Ukraine is his first official
trip to a foreign country since he came into office.
</P>
<P>
Meeting Kostov at airport, Ukrainian Prime Minister Valeriy
Pustovoitenko stressed the need to increase trade turnover between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Trade between Kiev and Sofia amounted to 177 million
U.S. dollars in the first eight months of this year, far short of
the target of half a billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Supply of natural gas to Bulgaria and method of payment for the
deliveries are the most urgent problems for the two sides to solve.
</P>
<P>
During Kostov's stay in Ukraine, he expects to discuss
cooperation on energy and transport with Ukrainian offcials.
</P>
<P>
The two neighboring countries will seek ways to improve the
work of the Illychevsk (Ukraine)-Varna(Bulgaria) ferry line and to
build a transport corridor linking the Balkans to northern Europe
through Ukraine.

<HEADLINE> NZ Economy Not Weakened by Market Turmoil: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, October 31 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Finance Minister
Bill Birch has maintained that the underlying strength of the NZ
economy has not been affected by the recent worldwide sharemarket
turmoil.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to businesspeople Thursday in Hastings, about 350 km
northeast of Wellington, he admitted that events of the past six
days had shown NZ was not immune from international market
volatility, the local paper "The Dominion" reported today.
</P>
<P>
But he said ultimately, investors looked at the fundamental
strength of the economy.
</P>
<P>
"And the economy, overall, is sound and very well-placed for
growth."
</P>
<P>
Government financial statements to be issued later today would
show that tax revenues and the operating balance for the first
three months of the financial year were actually ahead of
forecast, he noted.
</P>
<P>
His remarks disputed some economists who predicted that the
slump on the sharemarket will slow the economic growth by half a
percentage point.
</P>
<P>
But Birch said large variations were not unusual on a quarterly
 basis.
</P>
<P>
"What is important is the results indicate that the lift in
activity, which is incorporated in the 1997 budget forecasts, has
been occurring," he argued.

<HEADLINE> Mideast Peace Talks to Resume in US Monday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 30 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli and Palestinian
leaders have agreed to resume their peace talks in the United
States next Monday, the U.S. State Department said today.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian
President Yasser Arafat told U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright Wednesday that they agreed to the arrangement, and the
talks will be convened by Albright, State Department spokesman
James Rubin told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The talks, to be held in the Washington area, are designed to
get Israel to yield more territory on the West Bank to the
Palestinians and to open discusssions about a Palestinian state
and the future of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The talks were delayed a week while the Israeli government
debated the positions Foreign Minister David Levy would take in
the negotiations with Mahmoud Abbas, a senior deputy to Arafat.
The Israeli cabinet authorized Levy to attend the talks Monday.
</P>
<P>
Albright telephoned both Arafat and Netanyahu to take stock of
the situation and she found them ready for serious negotiations,
Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
The talks will focus on further Israeli withdrawal under the
1993 and 1995 Oslo accords, a halt to Jewish settlement buildings
on the West Bank and other major issues.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians demand a state, control of part of Jerusalem
and the disposition of refugees. But the Israeli side has been
urging the Palestinians to go directly into negotiations on a
permanent peace agreement, an idea they insist is only a ploy by
Israel to avoid giving back land.

has moved from 35th place in 1980 to the current 10th in terms of
total transport turnover, and from the 33rd to the current 5th in
terms of total number of passenger carried.
</P>
<P>
Chen said China began purchasing aircraft from the Boeing in
1972 and then from McDonnell Douglas in 1983. Up to present, both
Boeing and MD have sold 337 aircraft to China with a total value
of 15.3 billion dollars. The Boeing and MD have captured about 60
percent of aircraft fleet in China civil aviation.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese purchase of U.S. aircraft has had a significant
impact on Sino-American trade and commercial relations, he added.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Commerce Secretary Daley said, the sale could be a
"turning point in U.S.-China trade." It is a strong signal that
China wants to build a stronger commercial relationship with the
U.S., on the basis of cooperation and mutual benefits, he said.
</P>
<P>
"It will lead to further cooperation not just in commercial
aircraft but also in air traffic control, airport construction,
and air safety," Daley added.
</P>
<P>
The latest deal, involving the sale of eight B777s, one 747,
five 757s, and 36 737s, could be "a critical step in addressing
our trade imbalance," the Secretary stressed.
</P>
<P>
The new deal was announced by U.S. President Bill Clinton and
visiting Chinese President Jiang Zemin on Wednesday during their
summit meeting at the White House.

<HEADLINE> US Warns Iraq Against Barring US Inspectors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 30 (Xinhua) -- The United States today
warned Iraq of "serious consequence" after the latter barred U.S.
arms inspectors from searching for illegal weapons in defiance of
the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
"This is a very serious matter and we are not ruling any option
out," said James Rubin, spokesman of the State Department.
</P>
<P>
The United States was rallying Russia and its Western allies to
take joint action in the United Nations Security Council.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said that the U.S. was to seek a declaration in
the Security Council Friday that Iraq has breached the cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
Iraq said Wednesday that 10 American weapons inspectors must
leave Iraq within a week. It also asked the United Nations to stop
using U.S. reconnaissance planes to monitor Iraqi compliance in
eliminating the weapons.
</P>
<P>
The demand was rejected by the United States, but Iraq refused
today to cancel its decision and warned it was prepared for a
military confrontation if pushed.
</P>
<P>
"We are on the defense, but if they (the Americans) pushed the
issue towards a military confrontation, we would not be scared of
this option and we will not back down from the stand we took," he
said.

<HEADLINE> China Attaches Importance to Agriculture, Food Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 30 (Xinhua) -- China had attached great
importance to agriculture and food security, and this was a
strategic issue which had bearings on the future of the nation as
well as on people's lives, Chinese delegate Cui Ying said here
today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the 52nd session of the United Nations, Cui Ying
said the Chinese government had always attached great importance
to the issues of agriculture and food, and China had made
agriculture the foundation for overall economic development.
</P>
<P>
Cui said China had persisted in giving top priority to
agriculture on its economic work. Relying on domestic resources to
achieve basic food self-sufficiency had been China's basic policy
on the issue of food security.
</P>
<P>
Cui said the issue of agricultural development was given great
prominence at the just-completed 15th National Congress of the
Communist Party of China. The report to the congress advocated a
number of basic cross-century agricultural development policies.
</P>
<P>
Cui said China was currently confronted with acute ecological
problems. Efforts aimed at increasing grain output, increasing the
use of chemical fertilizers, expanding irrigation, and developing
township enterprises would all contribute to putting greater
pressures on environmental resources.
</P>
<P>
Cui said the Chinese government had expressly adopted a
strategy of sustainable development. In the agricultural sector,
the goal for the 21st century was to achieve agricultural
modernization based on sustainability, that was: to proceed on the
basis of special conditions in China, and pursue sustainable and
intensive agricultural development and food production.
</P>
<P>
She noted that in making vigorous efforts to resolve the issue
of food security for China, China was not only responding to the
needs of its own economic and social development, but also making
a great contribution to the eradication of poverty and the
achievement of sustainable development in the whole world.

six leading economic institutes.

<HEADLINE> Greece Will Not Change Economic Policy Despite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Despite recent turmoil in
international and domestic markets, Greece would not change its
present economic policy, National Economy and Finance Minister
Yiannos Papantoniou said today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters, Papantoniou stressed that there was no
reason to change the economic policy and the ruling government was
determined to defend it "at any cost."
</P>
<P>
Economists here believe that Greece's economic performance is
now the best in the last decade with public deficits and inflation
at a 25-year low. The hard-drachma policy is considered necessary
to curb the inflation which is now estimated at 4.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that although the country's economy was
showing steady growth, international market turmoil was having
repercussions on Europe and Greece because international investors
were restructuring their portfolios.
</P>
<P>
As for the impact of higher interest rates on the economy, he
said that a rise in money market rates was unpleasant but
necessary.
</P>
<P>
The minister forecast that any rises in domestic market rates
would have a ceiling and limited duration.
</P>
<P>
Greek equities remained under heavy pressure today for the
third consecutive session on the Athens Stock Exchange to end
sharply lower in record turnover boosted by two block trades.
</P>
<P>
Greek government spokesman Dimitris Reppas said today that the
pressure on stocks would not lead to a deadlock and current losses
were well within Greek economy's tolerance limits.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that interbank rates would increase by 1.1
percent.

<HEADLINE> Kohl Party Rejects Dual-Nationality for Foreigners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, October 30 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
government today ruled out offering dual-nationality for
foreigners seeking to live in Germany, saying they should decide
"where their loyalty is."
</P>
<P>
"There will be no general double-citizenship.... This is a
question of our identity and there can be no compromise on this,"
a deputy from Kohl's ruling coalition told parliament.
</P>
<P>
Kohl also warned that allowing dual-nationality would trigger
off a new flood of foreigners coming to Germany.
</P>
<P>
There are currently 7.3 million foreigners in Germany, or 9
percent of the population.
</P>
<P>
German nationality is based on blood and not on place of birth.
Opposition Greens parliamentary deputy Cem Oezdmir, the first
Turkish-German elected to the federal assembly, criticized the law
for hampering the integration of foreigners.
</P>
<P>
"It deserves to be put on the rubbish heap of history," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Some deputies from the ruling coalition also believed it was
necessary for the law to be eased.
</P>
<P>
Under the German law, ethnic Germans elsewhere whose ancestors
left Germany 200 years ago might almost automatically receive a
German passport while a third generation member of Turkish family
born today in Germany must go through a complex and expensive
naturalization process.
