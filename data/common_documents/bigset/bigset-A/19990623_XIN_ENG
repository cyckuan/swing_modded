<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank on Tuesday
approved a total of 353 million U.S. dollars in loan and credit
for Egypt to strengthen financial institutions and develop
agriculture in the North African country.
</P>
<P>
The bank said in a statement the money will be used to support
private sector-led growth to meet increased employment needs for
Egypt's rapidly growing population.
</P>
<P>
Part of the funds will be used for rural economic development
to boost rural employment in Egypt, with the balance slated for
strengthening the Principal Bank for Development and Agricultural
Credit, Egypt's public-sector bank for funding financial services
in rural areas.

<HEADLINE> Hingis Ousted in Wimbledon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 22 (Xinhua) -- World women's number one Martina
Hingis of Switzerland produced the day's biggest story when she
was crashed by 16-year-old qualifier Jelena Dokic 6-2, 6-0 in the
first round of the women's singles on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time since 1994 that the top seed in the women
's Wimbledon draw went out in the first round -- back then it was
Steffi Graf who was sent packing by American Lori McNeil.
</P>
<P>
The only other top seed to lose in the first round of a Grand
Slam since the Open Era began in 1968 was Virginia Ruzici of
Romania who was upset by Margaret Sawyer at the 1979 Australian
Open.
</P>
<P>
Hingis started the season in fine fashion, winning the
Australian Open for the third consecutive year, which included a
third round victory over Dokic in their only other encounter.
</P>
<P>
However, on the lawn, the 16-year-old Dokic, who made her debut
at Wimbledon via the qualifying tournament, did the unthinkable in
an astonishing Court One performance.
</P>
<P>
The Australian, world junior champion last year, broke Hingis
twice in the first set and then looked in a class of her own for
the rest of the match.
</P>
<P>
She made the Swiss star look like a novice, running her around
the court and smashing winners past her at will, before completing
the sensational shock victory in just 54 minutes.
</P>
<P>
"It's amazing, just amazing," Dokic said as 1987 men's champion
Pat Cash embraced her afterwards.
</P>
<P>
"I guess I still can't believe I beat her," said the No. 129
ranked Dokic, smiling. "It was a big win for me, coming from
qualifying. I thought I played quite well."
</P>
<P>
The top seed has only been beaten in the opening round of a
Wimbledon singles three times in the 122-year history of the world
's most prestigious tournament, and never to a qualifier.
</P>
<P>
Hingis, who won here in 1997, said she planned to take a break
from tennis and appeared to have split from her coach -- her
mother Melanie. "Maybe I just need a break from everything right
now. A break would really suit me," she said.
</P>
<P>
"This tournament, we decided to have a little bit of distance,"
vHingis admitted. "We'll probably work a bit more on our private
lives and see how its is going to go in the future."
</P>
<P>
In another women's singles match, Jennifer Capriati of the
United States beat Germany's Anke Huber 5-7, 6-3, 9-7 when the
suspended match resumed today.
</P>
<P>
Capriati, who in 1991 became the youngest women's Wimbledon
semifinalist aged 15 years 95 days, was joined in the second round
by defending champion Jana Novotna of Czech Republic who beat Wang
Shi-ting of Chinese Taipei 6-2, 6-1.
</P>
<P>
Third seed Lindsay Davenport of the United States crushed
Alexandra Fusai of France 6-0, 6-3 while Spanish seventh-seed
Arantxa Sanchez Vicario recovered from a slow start to beat
Hungary's Annamaria Foldenyi 4-6, 6-3, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
The men stayed out of the limelight on the traditional Ladies'
Day at Wimbledon, avoiding shock upsets - but only just.
</P>
<P>
Three-time champion Boris Becker battled from two sets down and
saved three match points in the fourth set against Briton Miles
MacLagan to keep his final Wimbledon dream alive.
</P>
<P>
The 31-year-old unseeded German finally subdued the unheralded
Scot 5-7, 6-7, 6-4, 7-5, 6-2 for a victory as great as any he
achieved in his glory years a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
He was joined in the second round by third seed Yevgeny
Kafelnikov who narrowly avoided defeat when his darkness-delayed
first round match with Magnus Larsson resumed at two sets apiece
and 5-5 in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
The Russian former world number one eventually squeezed through
6-7, 7-5, 7-6, 4-6, 7-5.
</P>
<P>
Andre Agassi hardly put a foot wrong on center court as the
form that took him to the French Open title this month continued
on grass and he thrashed Romanian Andrei Pavel 6-1, 6-2, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
Second seed Pat Rafter dealt with Cristiano Caratti of Italy 6-
3, 6-2, 6-2, while Brazilian 11th-seed Gustavo Kuerten recorded
his first victory on grass beating Chris Wilkinson 6-4, 6-4, 6-4.

<P>
LONDON, June 22 (Xinhua) -- World number one Martina Hingis of
Switzerland, who was humiliated in the women's singles first round
Tuesday afternoon, withdrew from the doubles.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss was beaten 6-2, 6-0 by 16-year-old Australian
qualifier Jelena Dokic in the most sensational upset in the
tournament's recent history.
</P>
<P>
Tournament referee Alan Mills issued a statement late on
Tuesday evening saying that Hingis had pulled out of the doubles "
due to a recurring medical problem".
</P>
<P>
Hingis and Russian Anna Kournikova were seeded second in the
doubles.
</P>
<P>
Mills said their place would be taken in the draw by Americans
Debbie Graham and Lori McNeil.

<HEADLINE> Kiribati Recommended for U.N. Membership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 22 (Xinhua) - The U.N. Security Council's
Admissions Committee on Tuesday recommended extending U.N.
membership to Kiribati.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council's Admissions Committee made the decision
after holding a closed-door meeting this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Kiribati applied for U.N. membership in late April and the
Security Council sent its application to its Admission Committee
in early May.
</P>
<P>
Kiribati, comprised of the Gilbert, Line and Phoenix Islands,
is located close to the equator. It has a population of about
85,000, an area of some 717 sq km.
</P>
<P>
The admissions committee has the same membership as the
15-nation Security Council and its recommendations are invariably
endorsed by the council itself, which then recommends that the
General Assembly formally admit new applicants.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations currently has 185 members.

<HEADLINE> Air France Signs Agreement of Alliance with U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 22 (Xinhua) -- France's national carrier Air France
announced on Tuesday that it has signed an agreement with the U.S.
Delta Air Lines on setting up a global air alliance by the end of
this year.
</P>
<P>
The Executive Officer of Air France Jean-Cyril Spinetta and the
Executive Officer of Delta Air Lines Leo F. Mullin signed the
agreement after holding a joint press conference in Paris.
</P>
<P>
By establishing the alliance, Air France and Delta Air Lines
aim to compete with other global air alliances like the
British-American ``Star'' in both passenger and cargo markets,
said the two executives.
</P>
<P>
Predicting that it will ``change completely the landscape'' of
world air market, Spinetta and Mullin said that they welcome other
companies to join them as the founding members of the alliance.
</P>
<P>
They said that the primary purpose of establishing the alliance
is to provide the customers with the best quality service and the
best price.
</P>
<P>
``Today, the customers should be able to travel or send their
cargos in the whole world from anywhere to everywhere, but no
single air company can do this alone,'' said Mullin.
</P>
<P>
They said that they will ``align their commercial policies,''
but will not merge their capitals or exchange their shares now.
</P>
<P>
``Delta and Air France have thrown the basis of a global
alliance which will offer a service of great quality and a first
class air routes network, leading to the markets which are most
demanded by our customers,'' said Spinetta.
</P>
<P>
In contrast with the Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines which is an
armed to the teeth American free marketplace venture, Air France
is still a half public enterprise with the French government
exerting strong influence over its policy.
</P>
<P>
Both Air France and Delta Air Lines have more than 70 years of
history and were among the world's oldest air companies.
</P>
<P>
Air France has a air routes network with 174 destinations in 85
countries and is strongly established in the Americas, Europe,
Asia, Africa and the Middle East. It is also the world's fourth
largest passenger carrier and the third largest cargo carrier.
</P>
<P>
Being the most travelled air company in the United States,
Delta Air Lines serves 230 cities in 29 countries and holds a
dominating position in the eastern part of the United States.

<HEADLINE> Major Military Exercise Under Way in Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Russia's biggest military exercise
since the end of the Cold War is under way, involving top military
officials across the entire territory of European Russia.
</P>
<P>
Colonel General Yuri Baluyevsky, head of the Department for
Operational Command of the Russian Armed Forces General Staff,
said at a press conference Tuesday that the exercise was not a
direct reaction to NATO's air strikes against Yugoslavia but the
events in the Balkans "were certainly taken into account in
planning."
</P>
<P>
The week-long exercise, which started on Monday, or West '99, was
planned in December last year, Baluyevsky said.
</P>
<P>
He said all forces of five military districts from the Black
Sea to the Arctic White Sea are involved now in the exercises
code-named Zapad (West) '99. "They are so-called top staff level
exercises involving 50,000 troops on the ground."
</P>
<P>
The North, Baltic and Black Sea fleets and about 20 commands of
formations of armed services and three formations of the Air Borne
Troops are also involved.
</P>
<P>
"The drill aims to upgrade the work of the command of the
Russian Armed Forces in cooperation with the command of other
military units and institutions of the Russian Federation,"
Baluyevsky said.
</P>
<P>
In addition to regular armed forces, a task force from
neighboring Belarus, troops of the Russian Interior Ministry,
units from the Federal Border Guard Service and the Ministry of
Emergencies will also take part in the exercise overseen by
Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev.
</P>
<P>
Delegates of Kazakhstan's armed forces will attend the exercise
as observers, Baluyevsky said.

<HEADLINE> FM: Russia to Pursue Non-Confrontational Ties With West </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov said here Tuesday that Moscow pursues policy of
non-confrontation in its ties with the West while upholding its
own interests.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the first Congress of the Russian Press, Ivanov
stressed the importance of the United Nations as "the unique
mechanism to regulate the international relations."
</P>
<P>
He said Russia favors the strengthening of the United Nations
and a larger role of the U.N. Security Council that is responsible
for keeping peace and stability throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
"The attempts to justify the use of force without a sanction of
the United Nations and reference to the so-called humanitarian
interventions do not stand to criticism," Ivanov said, apparently
referring to NATO's air strikes against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
He called for the U.N. to adapt to new international problems
such as peacekeeping and reaction to crisis.
</P>
<P>
"These problems will be discussed tomorrow at a meeting with
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan." Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
Annan, who arrived here Tuesday, also addressed the Congress of
the Russian Press, saying Russia remains a vital component in the
solution of problems faced by the international community on the
brink of the 21st century.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks Fall Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks fell sharply
Tuesday as rise in the bond yields sparked fears again among
investors about higher interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 94.35 at
10,721.63. The Index lost 39.58 points Monday.
</P>
<P>
Investors got eased about higher interest rates last week as
they believed that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates
to cool off the U.S. economy but the rise would not be too
drastic. But today's rise in the Yield on the 30-year Treasury
bond made them rethink that the rate problem was not settled.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were also lower. The technology heavy
Nasdaq composite index fell 50.02 at 2,580.26 and the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index dropped 13.12 at 1,335.88.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE composite index fell 3.83 at 633.11 and the American
Stock Exchange index fell 0.28 at 765.47. The Russell 2000 index
of smaller companies fell 2.11 at 447.33.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 9-to-7 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,299 up, 1,690 down and 564
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
NYSE volume increased to 704.29 million shares from 676.12

<HEADLINE> Lesotho Faces Cereal Shortage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Lesotho faces a domestic
cereal shortage of more than 162,000 tons in 1999/2000 to feed its
population, a newsletter from the national early warning unit of
the Lesotho Disaster Management Authority said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
South African Press Association quoted the newsletter as saying
the cereal shortage would have to be covered through commercial
imports from South Africa or food aid from the international
community.
</P>
<P>
The cereal imports to be undertaken by major millers in the
country will include 134,800 tons of maize and 70,450 tons of
wheat.
</P>
<P>
The supply of food aid expected from the United Nations World
Food Program will be 22,900 tons of maize.
</P>
<P>
The early warning unit said the cause of the domestic cereal
shortage was attributed to the fact that "a sizable portion of the
crop, especially maize, was damaged beyond recovery during the
long dry spell that affected the country during January to March
this year."
</P>
<P>
As part of the government's plan to assist farmers in boosting
agricultural production, Lesotho Minister of Agriculture
Cooperative and Land Reclamation, Kelebone Maope, announced that
the government was seriously considering ways of assisting farmers
to prepare to plow their seeds in the coming summer season.

<HEADLINE> Meeting on African Child Illness Opens in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 22 (Xinhua) -- A three-day World Health
Organization (WHO) regional meeting on the Integrated Management
of Childhood Illness (IMCI) program was opened in Zimbabwean
capital Harare Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from 20 African countries attended the meeting
which aimed at improving the implementation of the IMCI program
through information sharing among countries.
</P>
<P>
The program was started in Africa four years ago with the
purpose of improving the management of childhood illnesses.
</P>
<P>
It was also aimed at implementing strategies to reduce child
mortality rate and severity of illness and to contribute to
improved growth and development.
</P>
<P>
At the opening ceremony, WHO regional director Ibrahim Gambo
said that the African region had the largest number of children
dying from diseases caused by poverty, homelessness and civil
strife.
</P>
<P>
He said even in times of peace there were large numbers of
displaced children who still need attention.
</P>
<P>
Children in the African region were mostly affected by such
diseases as respiratory infection, diarrhea, malaria and measles.
</P>
<P>
At the same function, Zimbabwean Deputy Minister of Health and
Child Welfare David Forirenyatwe said that the African countries
should strengthen their communities to manage the childhood
diseases at family level.

<HEADLINE> Britain Introduces Draft Resolution on UN Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Britain on Tuesday formally
introduced its draft resolution on UN policy towards Iraq which
suggests that oil embargo against Iraq be suspended if the country
answers the remaining questions about its weapons program.
</P>
<P>
The new proposal would create a new inspection agency for Iraq
to insure that Iraq is complying with its commitment to destroying
its weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Only if Iraq cooperates would oil embargo imposed after it
invaded Kuwait in 1990 be partially suspended, said the proposal,
adding that it would suspend sanctions on exports, but not
imports.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the proposal would maintain effective financial
controls on Iraqi revenues to insure that Iraq does not use the
revenue to buy or make weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
The proposal said the suspension would require the U.N.
Security Council approval every four months.
</P>
<P>
The draft resolution was co-sponsored by the Netherlands,
Argentina and Slovenia.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the press, Britain's Ambassador to the United
Nations Jeremy Greenstock said "We obviously have some political
divisions which still have to be sorted out."
</P>
<P>
He said it was his hope that the draft resolution represented a
new collectively approach on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council has been sharply divided on its policy
towards Iraq since the U.S.-led air strikes against Iraq last
December.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Wants Binding Cease-fire in Congo (K) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe
said Tuesday that he will only sign a sincere cease-fire
declaration ending the conflict in the Democratic Republic of
Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
Mugabe held a two-hour meeting Tuesday in Harare with his
Congolese counterpart Laurent Kabila on the regional summit
scheduled in Zambian capital Lusaka Saturday.
</P>
<P>
After their meeting, Mugabe told reporters that they were
currently making sure that the cease-fire package was practical.
</P>
<P>
"We are preparing our position which will be presented at the
ministerial meeting on Friday," Mugabe said. "We hope that this
meeting will show and tell us where they are heading."
</P>
<P>
"They will be looking at the pros and cons and these will be
reconciled until we have a document presented as one to which the
heads of state can append their signatures. The document should
not remain theoretical, but practical," he noted.
</P>
<P>
"We want a ceasefire that has meaning," the Zimbabwean
president stressed.
</P>
<P>
The two heads of state were expected to continue discussions
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Kabila arrived in Harare on Tuesday afternoon for a two-day
visit to Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
The cease-fire agreement contains the inputs from the Southern
African Development Community (SADC), the Organization of African
Unity (OAU), the United Nations as well as from Libya.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, Namibia, Angola and Chad sent their troops to help
Kabila to fight the DRC rebels who took up arms early last August,
while Uganda and Rwanda had been accused of support the DRC
rebels.

<HEADLINE> Blair Says New Deal Helps Young People to Get Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BIRMINGHAM June 22 (Xinhua) - British Prime Minister Tony Blair
announced Tuesday that the New Deal has found work for 100,000
young unemployed people since its launch last April.
</P>
<P>
In addition, 50,000 employers have signed up to the New Deal,
which putts it on track to meet the Government's pledge to get
250,000 from welfare into work, Blair said.
</P>
<P>
The New Deal for Young People is aimed at those aged 18-24 who
have been claiming Job-seekers Allowance (JSA) for at least 6
months.
</P>
<P>
Those aged 18-24 who have been claiming JAS continuously for 6
months become eligible for New Deal when they reach the 6-month
threshold.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the New Deal Conference here, Blair said the New
Deal had helped the United Kingdom to achieve the highest level of
employment in the country's history.
</P>
<P>
"The statistics speak for themselves. Among young people
long-term unemployment has fallen 60 percent since May 1997. We
now have the lowest level of youth unemployment since 1975," he
added.
</P>
<P>
But the Conservatives claim 36,000 of the young people who
signed up to the New Deal have simply vanished from records.

<HEADLINE> European Markets Held Back by Growth Fears </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON June 22 (Xinhua) - European markets failed to recoup
losses Tuesday as weak economic data from German and France and an
early slide on Wall Street left most bourses in negative
territory.
</P>
<P>
Last week's optimism over a European economic recovery was hit
by a surprise 0.6 percent fall in French industrial production in
April while German industrial production was revised downward to
0.7 percent in the same month.
</P>
<P>
Britain's FTSE 100 index closed lower on the session, shrinking
from near-record highs set the previous session as Wall Street
weakened and profit-takers targeted leading banks.
</P>
<P>
The blue chip UK index - which rose on Monday to its third
highest close on record - ended 28.8 points or 0.4 percent lower
at 6552.4, with fallers in a near three-to-two majority.
</P>
<P>
The bank sector accounted for 14 points of the FTSE 100's loss,
with profit-taking sending HSBC down 1.4 percent to wipe 3.8
points from the index.
</P>
<P>
Weakness in the two leading oil stocks took a further eight
points from the FTSE, as BP Amoco and Shell eased amid weakness in
crude prices.
</P>
<P>
Germany's benchmark Xetra Dax posted small gains on Tuesday as
rallying utility shares helped the index crawl into positive
ground during the final minutes of trade.
</P>
<P>
At the close, the Xetra Dax was a mere 0.20 point higher at
5468.67 points after a nearly five percent drop in business
software maker SAP buffeted the market for most of the session.
</P>
<P>
French stocks lost some luster, slipping after three straight
record closes, with Paris' CAC 40 ending down 7 points, or 0.16
percent, at 4538.04.

<P>
PORTLAND, June 22 (Xinhua) -- China is now ready for the second
group match against Ghana and confident of winning the group as
they moved into Portland.
</P>
<P>
China had their first work-out in Portland on Monday on a middle
school turf with every player in action, including captain Sun Wen
who suffered an injury in the first match against Sweden.
</P>
<P>
"Sun will be ok for the match against Ghana," said Chinese coach
Ma Yuanan, "the injury nothing serious."
</P>
<P>
In the first round of Group D competitions, China beat Sweden
2-1 while Australia and Ghana fought to a 1-1 tie.
</P>
<P>
"Ghana is a good team, we'll not underestimate them." said Ma
Yuanan, "but we are confident of winning the match as we have the
better technique and teamwork."
</P>
<P>
Ma promised after China's first match against Sweden that his
team would play better and better. Ghana is considered the weakest
team in the group and China is expected to win the match easier.
</P>
<P>
Ghana will miss their defender Barikisu Telley-Quao who was sent
off at the 26th minute in the match against Australia. That will
give the Chinese team more chances of exploring the Ghana's defense
line.

Organization of African Unity (OAU) Framework Agreement for peace
solution to Ethio-Eritrean border conflict.

KAMPALA, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
has urged people in the southwestern district of Bushenyi to
promote immunization programs in order to banish the common and
preventable diseases that afflict the east African country.
</P>
<P>
He made the appeal when addressing a public rally in the
district Tuesday, a press release from the President's Office
said.
</P>
<P>
People there were advised to observe strict hygiene and feed
nutritiously.
</P>
<P>
The president, who is on his tour of the southwestern districts
of the country, talked about the development projects which the
government has put in place in the district and stressed provision
of safe drinking water in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
He promised the rally that the district would soon get piped
water.
</P>
<P>
Uganda's infrastructure is relatively poor. More than half of

<HEADLINE> Security Council to Have More Consultations With Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The decision came after the 15 Security Council members met in
a closed-door session to discuss to hear the briefing by the
under-secretary-general for peacekeeping, Bernard Miyet, on his
visit to the southwest African country.
</P>
<P>
In a statement read to the press here, the president of the
Security Council, Ismaila Babourcarr-Blaise Jagne of Gambia, said,
the Council members "underlined the importance of continuing the
consultations between the U.N. and the Government of Angola on the
future U.N. presence in the country."
</P>
<P>
The Council members also expressed their interest in an
agreement reached by the U.N. Secretariat and the Angolan
Government on this issue, the statement said, referring to the
fact that senior Angolan officials have agreed in principle to a
small United Nations mission for the country.
</P>
<P>
Fred Eckhard, U.N. spokesman, told a press conference Monday
that the Angolan minister for external relations agreed that a
small U.N. mission would include political, information and
humanitarian components.
</P>
<P>
There was no agreement, as yet, on military observers or human
rights monitors, but more discussions would follow, said the
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The mandate of MOUNA, the previous U.N. mission in Angola, was
terminated in February this year by the Security Council on the
recommendation of the U.N. secretary-general, Kofi Anna, who said
that the peace process had collapsed and the country was in a
state of war.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council has accused UNITA, the National Union for
the Total Independence of Angola which is led by Jonas Savimbi, of
reneging on a 1994 peace accord that called for disarming its
rebel fighters.
</P>
<P>
The southwest African nation plunged back into civil war in
December in the final breakdown of the peace accord when the
government tried to ferret out UNITA fighters but failed to
capture all the diamond-rich areas they control.

<HEADLINE> Angola Urged to Allocate More Funds for Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Children's Fund (UNICEF)
has urged the Angolan government to allocate more funds for
children whether the country is in war or peace.
</P>
<P>
"Children deserve to enjoy more funds in their country," Deputy
 Executive Director of the UNICEF, Karin Sham Poo, told a press
conference here Tuesday before ending her six-day visit to the
war-torn southern African country.
</P>
<P>
She called upon the Angolan government to allocate a bigger
proportion of its budget to the improvement of the civil society
and in return it can attract more funds from the international
community.
</P>
<P>
The UNICEF official also expressed her concern over serious
malnutrition the Angolan children and women are facing, pledging
more financial assistance from the international community.
</P>
<P>
She was satisfied with the cooperation between the UNICEF and
the Angolan government in preventing such diseases as polio,
malaria and AIDS.
</P>
<P>
During her stay in Angola, the UNICEF official consulted with
government departments, international relief organizations based
in Angola and some non-governmental organizations on the
conditions of the Angolan children.
</P>
<P>
Since war resumed in Angola late last year, the number of the
war- created refugees has exceeded 1.6 million, most of whom are
children and women who are living in dire conditions.
</P>
<P>
However, military spending accounts for 38 percent of Angola's
1999 budget.

<HEADLINE> Steel Quota Bill Fails to Clear Hurdle in U.S. Senate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. steel industry on
Tuesday suffered a major setback in its efforts aiming to stem
foreign competition as the U.S. Senate voted 42-57 to close off
debate on the bill to impose quotes on steel imports, 18 short of
the 60 votes needed to move the bill to the floor of the Senate
for an actual vote.
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the measure sought quotas as a way to help combat
low-priced steel imports and preserve U.S. steelworking jobs.
</P>
<P>
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, a Republican from
Mississippi, argued against the bill, joining Clinton
administration officials in warning that quotas could start an
international trade war and cut off U.S. exports from foreign
markets.
</P>
<P>
"It will... adversely affect our businesses and farmers who
depend upon access to the international market," Lott said.
"There's no question that this bill will undercut the economic
growth that we enjoy today."
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of steelworkers rallied near the Capitol this morning
in a last-minute push in support of quotas.
</P>
<P>
The test on quotas followed Senate passage Friday of a bill
that would create a 1.5-billion-U.S.-dollar loan program for U.S.
steel, oil and gas producers hurt by fallen prices. The steel
industry says the loans would only be a first step toward
addressing its plight.
</P>
<P>
Top administration officials lobbied heavily against the bill.
On Monday, Commerce Secretary William Daley said there would be
grave risks to the U.S. economy if the bill becomes law.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. steel industry blames the foreign shipments for
bankruptcies at three U.S. companies and for thousands of layoffs.
Foreign shipments reached record highs last year in the wake of
the Asian economic crisis, which reduced demand for steel abroad
and forced foreign producers to turn to the United States.
</P>
<P>
The quota bill would impose monthly quotas on steel shipments
equal to the average levels in the three years before July 1997.
The measure also would set up an import notification system to
better track shipments into the country.
</P>
<P>
The House overwhelmingly passed the quotas bill, 289-141, in
March, despite the threat of a presidential veto. The total was
one short of the number needed to override a veto when all 435
members are voting.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Criticizes G-8 of Involving in Cyprus Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail
Cem Tuesday criticized the G-8 countries for their attempts to
get involved in the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
Cem told reporters at Kayseri, central Anatolia of Turkey,
that the call of the G-8s for the resumption of talks over the
Cyprus issue with no preconditions might cause trouble for
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the G-8, grouping the United State, Canada, Britain,
France, Italy, Germany, Japan and Russia made the call in the
final statement issued in their Cologne summit Sunday.
</P>
<P>
They urged U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan "to invite the
leaders of the two parties on Cyprus to negotiations in the fall
of 1999."
</P>
<P>
They also urged leaders of the two parties to commit themselves
to the principles of no preconditions during the negotiations, all
issues to be on the table, full consideration of relevant
U.N. resolutions and treaties, and to continue negotiating until
a settlement is reached.
</P>
<P>
"Being rich is the common characteristic of the G-8s. But
wealth does not necessarily mean wisdom, " said Cem.
</P>
<P>
Cem pledged strong support for the Turkish Cypriots, vowing
that Turkey's determination on the Cyprus issue would continue.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Monday that
the acknowledgment of the existence of "Turkish Republic of
Northern Cyprus" is the only way to the resumption of bilateral
talks in the long-divided Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriots-dominated
south and the Turkish Cypriots-controlled north since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
The U.N.-led international community has been trying for
decades to reunite the island through a bi-zonal, bi-communal
federation formula, but so far no tangible results have been
achieved.
</P>
<P>
In 1983, Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas declared
breakaway state in northern Cyprus, which is now recognized only
by Turkey.

<HEADLINE> IMF Praises Albania for Its Restoring Economic Stability </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 22 (Xinhua) - The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) on Tuesday praised Albania for its success in restoring
macroeconomic stability following the riots of 1997 and said the
government was set to meet its 1999 targets on growth and
inflation.
</P>
<P>
"Directors commended the authorities for their success in
restoring macroeconomic stability following the 1997
disturbances," The IMF said in an annual review of the Albanian
economy.
</P>
<P>
The IMF also said Albania would be able to cut interest rates
if inflation remained low and the exchange rate stayed stable.
</P>
<P>
But the government needed to do more to collect taxes and to
keep structural reforms on track, the IMF said. The authorities
should accelerate efforts to privatise the Savings Bank and to
finalise the sale of the National Commercial Bank.
</P>
<P>
"Directors praised the authorities' response to the formidable
challenges posed by the Kosovo crisis," the IMF said. "Directors
considered that, with sufficient external support, Albania should
be able to meet its macroeconomic program objectives in 1999 and
continue to address the still severe development problems facing
the country."
</P>
<P>
Albania is the poorest country in Europe and per capital gross
national product is just 800 U.S. dollars per year. Over 460,000
refugees flooded into Albania during NATO's bombing campaign
against Yugoslavia, putting new burdens on the state budget.
</P>
<P>
The IMF, in an effort to help Albania cope with the refugee
problems, last week increased the size of its loan to Albania by
13.1 million dollars and approved the payment of a 12.9 million
dollar instalment from the credit.
</P>
<P>
The IMF said Albania's economy grew 8 percent last year, after
a decline of 7.1 percent in 1997, when the country was racked by
rioting and civil unrest. Inflation fell to 8.7 percent in 1998,
from 42.1 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The IMF said it expected growth to hold steady at 8 percent in
1999, provided social stability could be maintained. Inflation was
likely to fall to about 7 percent.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Development Program (UNDP) has launched a 1.6-million-U.S. dollar
program in Togo to assist the west African country in improving or
building new infrastructure and in creating construction and
environmental improvement jobs, a UNDP news release said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The initiative will first get under way in the cities of Lome,
capital of Togo, and in Tsevie, 40 kilometers north of the
capital, the news release said.
</P>
<P>
Funding and technical assistance from the project will help
communities build schools, water fountains, public latrines, roads
and market places.
</P>
<P>
It will also provide sanitation equipment to support
municipality clean-up programs. Training will be offered to
workers, especially women. Eighty percent of the population in
Togo lives in extreme poverty, said the news release.
</P>
<P>
Due to the country's recent economic crisis many people have
migrated to urban areas, hoping to escape poverty and find jobs.
</P>
<P>
The program is part of plans initiated by the U.N system to
promote economic expansion in African countries.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Senate Votes to Cut U.S. Contributions to U.N. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Senate Tuesday
approved a measure to cut U.S. contributions to the United Nations
as the price of an agreement to release nearly one billion U.S.
dollars in back dues owed to the world organization.
</P>
<P>
According to the bill approved by a vote of 98 to 1, the U.S.
will reduce its share of the regular U.N. budget from the present
25 percent to 20 percent; and a drop in the share of peacekeeping
operations from 31 percent to 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
The reduction, which has been strongly opposed by the United
Nations, in payments would be unilateral, made over expected U.N.
objections.
</P>
<P>
The measure, a two-year 6.4 billion U.S. dollars spending bill
for the State Department, now goes to the House, where similar
legislation in the past became snarled in an unrelated dispute
over abortion.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has warned the United States that it will
lose its General Assembly voting rights if at least 250 million
U.S. dollars of the back dues isn't paid by December.
</P>
<P>
The United States has been late on its payments for the past 13
years and is the country which owes the U.N. most. It owes 1.69
billion U.S. dollars to the world organization, or 60 percent of
the total debt owed by the members.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Govt. Agrees to Own 5% of Gold Mine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian government Tuesday
signed the amendments of the Bulyanhulu gold mine agreement,
reducing its shares from 15 percent to five percent in light with
the new mining tax structure.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed by Abdallah Kigoda, Minister for
Energy and Minerals, and Paul Fortin, Director of the Kahama Gold
Mining Corporation Limited under the Barrick Gold Corporation
limited of Canada.
</P>
<P>
The Bulyanhulu gold mine, situated in the northwestern
Shinyanga region, is estimated to need a capital investment of 300
million U.S. dollars, and so far 70 million dollars have been
spent on the on-going operations.
</P>
<P>
Kigoda said the agreement follows the new tax structure of the
mining sector under the Financial Laws Act of 1997 and the Mining
Act passed by the parliament in April this year.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the government will own five percent
shares in the company contrary to 15 percent it owned before the
amendments, whereby its 10 percent shares go to the dividend
withholding tax under the new tax structure.
</P>
<P>
"The government will keep close relation with the company to
facilitate its activities in the country," Kigoda said.
</P>
<P>
The government also wished that the company will promote social
and economic development in the mining areas such as roads,
schools, electricity, hospitals, water facilities as well as
employment, the minister added.
</P>
<P>
Fortin said the mine has proven reserves of about 140 tons of
gold and possible reserves of another 140 tons.

<HEADLINE> Minority Party Senators Deny Taking Bribe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Senators from Nigeria's two minority
parties reacted angrily to allegations by their colleagues from
the majority party that they were bribed by ministerial nominees
to facilitate their clearance.
</P>
<P>
Their denial came Tuesday as the 109-member Senate resumed the
screening of the nominees, more than two weeks after their names
were submitted by President Olusegun Obasanjo.
</P>
<P>
"This is unkind, malicious, false and unbecoming of an
honorable member of the distinguished Senate, " Senators Wahab
Dosumnu of the Alliance for Democracy and Alex Kadiri of the All
People's Democratic Party said of the allegation published in
Monday's edition of This Day, a popular Nigerian newspaper.
</P>
<P>
In the report , Senator Gbenga Aluko of the ruling People's
Democratic Party alleged that some of the 49 nominees bribed
senators of the two parties and proposed that such nominees should
be dropped.
</P>
<P>
But Dosumnu and Kadiri dismissed the allegation at a press
conference ahead of the resumed sitting of the upper chamber of
the Nigeria's top legislature as a "calculated attempt to damage
the reputation of principle characters of the two parties."
</P>
<P>
The Senate has only cleared five of the nominees, more than two
weeks after the list was submitted by President Obasanjo.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Senate, which has constitutional responsibility
for clearing ministerial nominees, asked the president to provide
additional information on the nominees to facilitate clearance.
</P>
<P>
This was before the president meeting with the senators, first
with those of his party, to try to resolve the problems that have
stalled the clearance process.
</P>
<P>
The two senators challenged their colleague behind the
allegation to name those that have been bribed and warned they
would take legal action against This Day, which published the
allegation.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Loses $200-300M of Animal Products Yearly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian Ministry of
Agriculture said Tuesday that the Horn of Africa country loses 200
million to 300 million U.S. dollars of animal products every year.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening of the fifth annual conference of the
national society of veterinary technicians here, Hadera Gebru,
head of veterinary resources development and health technology
supervision department of the ministry, said that rampant animal
contagion and low fodder production are responsible for the loss.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia has the largest livestock population in sub-Saharan
Africa.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian News Agency quoted Hadera as saying that the
country's crop production is largely affected as the 13 million
oxen and pack animals being used for agricultural and
transportation purposes are highly vulnerable to diseases.
</P>
<P>
She called on veterinary technicians to coordinate their
efforts with a view to alleviating the problems encountered in the
food production endeavors.
</P>
<P>
The three-day annual conference will discuss animal health
protection, veterinary drug control and fish hygiene.

<HEADLINE> 88 Kuwara Jews in Ethiopia Arrive in Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 22 (Xinhua) -- In an operation arranged by
Israeli Immigration and Absorption Ministry and the Jewish Agency,
the first batch of Ethiopian Jews from the Kuwara region arrived
in Israel on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The 88 immigrants, who arrived on an Ethiopian Airlines flight
at Ben-Gurion International Airport, were greeted by Immigration
and Absorption Minister Yuli Edelstein.
</P>
<P>
Some 3,500 Jews living in the upper Kuwara in Ethiopia were
brought to Israel seven years ago, while those in the lower Kuwara
were left behind.
</P>
<P>
Under a plan by the Israeli government and the Jewish Agency,
the remaining Kuwara Jews, whose number is more than 3,000, would
be brought to Israel in the next four months.
</P>
<P>
However, Ethiopian Air flies to Israel just twice a week, with
one flight landing on Tuesday and the other on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Since Jewish Sabbath restrictions prohibit taking advantage of
the Saturday landings, the immigration from Kuwara will continue
at a maximum rate of 100 Jews per week and the operation is
expected to take some eight months.
</P>
<P>
For the present, the Israeli government has no option but to
hope that Ethiopia will allow Israeli airlines El Al to operate
flights out of Ethiopia for a brief period in order to facilitate
the swift immigration.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Jewish Agency Sunday approved an allocation of
11 million U.S. dollars for the absorption of the Kuwara Jews and
the Russian and Yugoslav Jews expected over the next few months.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian President Advises Malawian Opposition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian President Benjamin
Mkapa Tuesday called on Malawi's opposition parties not to rush to
courts to protest the election results.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference at the Chileka Airport in
Blantyre, Malawi, Mkapa said it is wrong to assume that wherever
multi-party elections are held, the ruling party must lose.
</P>
<P>
He advised the opposition parties to make constructive
criticism in the spirit of national unity and prosperity, a press
release issued by the State House in Dar es Salaam said.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Bakili Muluzi was re-elected as the President of
Malawi. On Monday, Mkapa and other African leaders attended
Muluzi's swearing-in ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Malawi's main opposition, an alliance of the Malawi Congress
Party (MCP) and the Alliance for Democracy (AFORD), lost the vote
by a small margin and made frantic efforts to get their case
heard.
</P>
<P>
At the press conference, Mkapa urged political parties
throughout the African continent to shun the currently fast
developing culture of opposing everything that the government in
power undertakes.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he lauded the people of Malawi for conducting
peaceful and and democratic general elections.
</P>
<P>
On the situation of the Great Lakes Region, the Tanzanian
president told journalists that he is optimistic that the current
crisis will soon come to an end since all parties to the
conflicts are working hard for peaceful political settlements.
</P>
<P>
The president said the civil strifes in relevant countries have
not only affected themselves, but also produced impact on others.
He gave an example of Tanzania which has for many years seen
influx of refugees from neighboring war-torn countries.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa said the wars in the region are not only economically
wasteful but also have depleted human resources of the region,
thus it is urgent for the concerned parties to reach peaceful
solutions.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the issue of illegal trade between Malawi and
Tanzania, Mkapa assured the Malawian people that the two
governments will work together to resolve irregularities taking
place in the border region.

<P>
NICOSIA, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus Foreign Minister Ioannis
Kasoulides Tuesday said that if the Turkish side does not
respond to an invitation for Cyprus peace talks, the international
community will have to undertake its responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides made the remarks upon his arrival at Cyprus Larnaca
Airport from Luxembourg, where he attended the European Union
(EU) accession conference.
</P>
<P>
The G-8 (seven most industrialized nations plus Russia) summit
statement, issued Sunday in Cologne, Germany, urged for the
resumption of talks in Cyprus with no preconditions in the
upcoming autumn.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriot side had said that the acknowledgment of
the existence of "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" is the only
way to the resumption of bilateral talks in the Cyprus island.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots unilaterally declared the breakaway
"Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" in 1983, recognized only by
Ankara.
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides said that "we cannot prejudge their (the Turkish
Cypriot side) response," adding that this is something which the
government will anticipate.
</P>
<P>
"If they do not respond, then it will be a situation which
will have to be handled by the international community and the EU
and everyone should take up their responsibilities," the minister
added.
</P>
<P>
He said G-8 leaders offered their support for the mission of
good offices of U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan.

CAIRO, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Rwanda is seeking further
involvement by Egypt in peace efforts to end the 10-month-old war
in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRCong), Rwandan Vice
President Paul Kagane said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda "is looking forward to Egypt's support to continue its
efforts" aimed at achieving stability in the Great Lakes area,
Kagane told reporters after meeting with Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt's role in achieving stability is essential," said
Kagane, without saying what Egypt can exactly do to help stabilize
the situation in Congo, Rwanda's neighbor to the west.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders discussed the latest developments of the
situation in Congo and efforts to end the war between the
Rwandan-backed Congolese rebels and supporters to Congolese
President Laurent Kabila, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Rwandan vice president delivered a message to Mubarak from
his Rwandan counterpart Pasteur Bizimungu on bilateral ties, the
situation in Rwanda and further Egyptian aid.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak invited Kagane for a visit ahead of a meeting of
African foreign and defense ministers in Lusaka, Zambia, to
discuss a cease-fire plan in Congo.
</P>
<P>
If the ministers reach an agreement, the cease-fire plan is
expected to be finalized at a heads-of-state summit on June 26,
also in Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
The rebels, who took up arms in August, accuse Kabila of
mismanagement and corruption.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 22 (Xinhua) -- A former female reporter of the
infamous Hutu extremist radio, Radio Television Libre des Milles
Collines (RTLM), arrested last week, was charged Monday by the
Kigali Prosecutor office of inciting to genocide.
</P>
<P>
Valerie Bemeriki, 35, was arrested in eastern Congo by a
Rwandan commander in the region of Karehe, about a week ago. She
was then taken into custody in Gisenyi and then brought to Kigali,
Rwanda News Agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Bemeriki is charged with inciting the former government army,
the extremist Hutu militia, the Hutus at large to wipe out their
Tutsi neighbors on the infamous RTLM, before and during April -
July 1994.
</P>
<P>
''I confess to the crimes I'm charged with because I was a
journalist on the inflammatory RTLM radio,'' she declared, adding
that she was acting under pressure from her bosses and the
extremist Hutu regime.
</P>
<P>
''I'm ready to kneel down and beg forgiveness from the Rwandan
people,'' Bemeriki told reporters and dozens of by-standers.
</P>
<P>
Bemeriki, 35, was born in Giciye, in northwestern Rwanda, the
region of late Hutu president Juvenal Habyarimana and many top
civil and military officials of his regime.
</P>
<P>
She broadcast names of Tutsis to kill, disclosed places of
where they were hiding, and directing attacks by Hutu militia.
</P>
<P>
Bemeriki disclosed that soon after the defeat of the ''Hutu''
extremist government in July 1994, she crossed to eastern Congo
where she stayed until she was netted.
</P>
<P>
According to the Kigali prosecutor, Emmanuel Rukangira, once
her file will be complete, she will appear in court with another
RTLM journalist, Noel Hitimana, detained in Kigali Central Prison.

<P>
LUSAKA, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Zambian ruling party, Movement for
Multi- party Democracy (MMD), has appealed to political parties in
Africa to interact among themselves so as to have a better
understanding of each other.
</P>
<P>
MMD National Secretary, Michael Sata, said here Tuesday that it
is imperative for political parties in Africa, especially those in
power, to establish closer relations and learn from each other.
</P>
<P>
Sata was speaking when he hosted a delegation of 93 women
members of the Zimbabwe African National Union Patriotic Front
(ZANU-PF).
</P>
<P>
Sata, who is also minister without portfolio, said there was a
stronger relationship on the government level in the Southern
Africa region than at party levels.
</P>
<P>
"We want to encourage African parties, especially in the ruling
parties to interact and work together because we could have wrong
perceptions of each other due to wrong reports in the newspapers,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Sata said Zambia and Zimbabwe shared a rich and common history
which should bring the two countries even closer to each other.
</P>
<P>
He said Zambia had never regretted having sacrificed greatly in
terms of material and other resources during the struggle for
independence from colonial rule for Zimbabwe, Namibia, Angola,
Mozambique and other neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
He hailed ZANU-PF party for being the first official delegation
of a ruling party to visit Zambia and interact with their MMD
counterparts in the country.

<HEADLINE> East Timor Ballot Postponed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The United
Nations-organized ballot for East Timor's future has been
postponed, according to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
Annan who is travelling in Europe, told reporters in Moscow on
Tuesday that the ballot originally set for August 8 would be on an
undetermined date in August, a transcript issued in the U.N.
headquarters said.
</P>
<P>
"As you know, we have certain conditions which have to be
fulfilled. We have to ensure that the security situation was
conducive and appropriate, that the logistical problems were
solved, that we could deploy everybody on time.
</P>
<P>
"Having taken all these factors into consideration, we felt a
brief delay would be beneficial.
</P>
<P>
"So we have delayed it briefly, but the ballot will go ahead in
the month of August," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
East Timor, with an area of some 19,000 square kilometers, had
been a Portuguese colony until 1975. An internal rift led to
Indonesia's occupation of the territory and in 1976 it became a
province of Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia and Portugal agreed on May 5 that a ballot be
organized and conducted by the U.N. on August 8 to determine
whether the majority of the 800,000 East Timorese would choose
special autonomy within Indonesia or independence.
</P>
<P>
It seems that the U.N. needs more time to prepare for a
violence-free election.
</P>
<P>
On June 11, the U.N. Security Council decided to set up a U.N.
Mission in East Timor, comprising military and civil police
personnel to ensure a free and secure ballot.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Civil Servants Get 12 Percent Salary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government Tuesday
awarded 140,000 civil servants a 12-percent cost of living
adjustment with effect from January 1 this year.
</P>
<P>
Acting Minister of the Public Service, Labor and Social
Welfare, John Nkomo told reporters that the cabinet reached the
decision after carefully considering the plight of the civil
servants as the cost of living was sky- rocketing.
</P>
<P>
He said the Public Service Commission would not hesitate to
take appropriate action against any government workers who would
not turn up for work Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The civil servants had been on strike since last Wednesday to
press the government to award them a 20-percent cost of living
adjustment.
</P>
<P>
Nkomo said it had not been easy for the cabinet to reach the
level of the 12 percent, considering the economic climate
prevailing in the southern African country.
</P>
<P>
The civil servants should appreciate the offer, he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some civil servants, mainly teachers, have rejected
the 12 percent offered by the government, saying that it was too
little for them to cope with the harsh economic conditions.
</P>
<P>
The government workers vowed to continue with the strike until
the government awards them the 20-percent cost of living
adjustment.

<HEADLINE> ADB Approves Loan for Bangladesh's Secondary Education project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 22 (Xinhua) -- the Asian Development Bank (ADB)
Tuesday approved a loan of 60 million U.S. dollars for the
86-million dollar secondary education sector improvement project
in Bangladesh, said an ADB press release.
</P>
<P>
Some 34 million dollars of the project would be provided in the
form of the foreign exchange and approximately 52 million dollars
would come in the form of local currency.
</P>
<P>
The project will be implemented over a period of six years, to
be completed in October 2005. The directorate of secondary and
higher education is the executive agency for the project.
</P>
<P>
The objective of the project is to assist the Bangladeshi
government in reforming and restructuring the secondary education
through strengthening the policy-making and management capacity,
improving effectiveness in the use of education resources,
enhancing the quality of education and ensuring its relevance to
the world of work, and contributing to equitable access for
females and students in under-served areas.
</P>
<P>
The primary beneficiaries of the project will be the
approximately 10 million secondary students, including some 4.5
million girls between 2000 and 2011.
</P>
<P>
About 300,000 girls living in under-served areas will receive
stipend support, and 35,000 poor students in those areas will be
able to be enrolled in new secondary schools. The focus on girls
and under-served populations will redress current disadvantages
and lead to more equality in access to wage and self-employment
income opportunities.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations for the loan were earlier held at the ADB's
headquarters in Manila, the Philippines, from May 13-15, the
release added.

<HEADLINE> Greece Welcomes G-8 Intention to Help Resolve </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Greece on Tuesday welcomed the
G-8's intention to involve itself in the Cyprus issue as an
"encouraging" move.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the press briefing, Greek government spokesman
Dimitris Reppas said that the international community's activity
could bring a solution to the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
In a statement Sunday at the end of their annual summit in
Cologne, Germany, the leaders of seven most industrialized nations
urged the Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots to enter talks
without preconditions and negotiate in good faith until a
settlement is reached.
</P>
<P>
Nicosia had voiced its readiness to resume talks with Turkish
Cypriots with no conditions, but Turkish Prime Minister Bulent
Ecevit had rejected the G-8 leaders' appeal, saying that outside
intervention could lead to ethnic conflict on the island, which
has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops invaded and
occupied the northern third of Cyprus in the wake of a failed coup
seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Turkish Cypriots insist that any agreement in Cyprus
must be preceded by international recognition of the Turkish
Cypriot breakaway republic, which is only recognized by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Describing the Turkish position on the Cyprus problem as
"negative," Reppas said that Turkey wanted to keep Cyprus hostage.
</P>
<P>
Reppas warned that if Turkey did not respond to these
initiatives, it would be a country that moves outside the realm of
international legality.

<HEADLINE> Israel Urged to Change Attitude to Arab Citizens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Israel's Arab legislators
Tuesday expressed anger over the use of rubber bullets by Israeli
police in dispersing Arab protesters and called on the government
to change its policy toward Arab Israelis.
</P>
<P>
Hashem Mahameed, member of the Israeli Knesset, or Parliament,
on the United Arab List, told Israel Radio that an investigation
into the incident which ocurred in the northern city of Lod Monday
night was not enough.
</P>
<P>
"There should be a change in the government's general policy
on the Arab population," he said.
</P>
<P>
Arab Knesset member Azmi Bishara and seven other demonstrators
were injured when police fired rubber bullets towards about 200
residents protesting the demolition of an Arab house in Lod where
Arabs and Jews live together.
</P>
<P>
Police officials have presented a preliminary report of
investigation to the Knesset, which held a stormy debate on the
incident Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
After a visit to the conflict scene Tuesday, interim Knesset
Speaker Shimon Peres of the Labor Party said that the municipal
council of Lod has suspended the demolition of the Arab houses
which were allegedly built without permits.
</P>
<P>
The dovish former prime minister said he would propose to the
new government of Ehud Barak that a committee be set up to exam
every case of house demolition.
</P>
<P>
Barak, who won more than 95 percent of the Arab votes in the
elections held last month, has promised to work to resolve
imminent problems facing about 1 million Arab Israelis, who feel
discriminated in almost every field in the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
While vowing to form a broad-based government in order to push
forward the peace process and realize national reconciliation,
Barak has appeared not ready to break the long-time taboo to
include any of the three Arab parties in his governing coalition.
</P>
<P>
"I'm sorry to say that I don't see Barak treat us as
partners," Mahameed told Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that Mr. Barak will become more conscious of the Arab
problems and the future of co-existence between Jews and Arabs in
Israel," he said.

TEHRAN, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad Khatami
on Tuesday called for a fundamental change in the country's
administrative and managerial system.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a seminar sponsored by the Construction Jihad

a fundamental change in the administrative and managerial system

<P>
Any change in the management system calls for people's
knowledge and strong will of different powers, the Islamic

<P>
However, the Iranian president gave no specific reasons for
the fundamental change in the country's administrative system.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts said that bureaucracy, inefficiency and
complicated administrative procedures have seriously retarded the
country's economic development.
</P>
<P>
Khatami also praised the services of the Construction Jihad

in the agricultural sector, livestock breeding, pasture

<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 22 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Ambassador to Cyprus Kenneth
Brill told Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides that he did not mean
any offense by refusing to meet Cyprus acting president earlier
this month.
</P>
<P>
The statement was made Tuesday by Cyprus Parliament Speaker
Spyros Kyprianou after meeting with President Clerides who
informed him of his meeting with Brill Monday.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Brill had refused to meet Kyprianou, who
was at the time acting president of Cyprus during President
Clerides' absence, triggering strong reaction from some political
parties.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Embassy had also said in a statement that members of
the left-wing AKEL party and Kyprianou's Democratic Party had not
accepted invitations to embassy-sponsored events in recent weeks
but went to the embassy to protest against NATO's bombing against
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The two parties had expressed their dissatisfaction.
</P>
<P>
Kyprianou said President Clerides had discussed with Brill
"the need to maintain smooth relations with all political
parties."
</P>
<P>
Kyprianou said he got the impression that Brill's decision to
act in the way he did was taken in Nicosia but not in Washington
and that is why no representation was made.

<HEADLINE> Somali Anti-Aidid Conference Breaks Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The long-awaited Somali
Reconciliation Conference of the Hawiyeh Tribe, attended by
factions opposing Hussein Mohamed Aidid, broke down Monday night
over the leadership election between the political and clan-based
groups in the horn of Africa country.
</P>
<P>
Hussein Hajj Bod, one of the leaders attending the
six-month-long conference, said that seven of the nine clan
leaders attending the meeting boycotted the last part of the
conference which was aimed at electing the leadership body of the
Hawiyeh clan.
</P>
<P>
Bod, the former deputy chairman of Ali Mahdi Mohamed faction,
told this reporter in telephone that the politicians chose to
withhold patronage in their attempts of avoiding what he called
disturbances or armed confrontations.
</P>
<P>
The conference, held in Somali central town of Beletuein, was
supposed to conclude Wednesday after electing a political leader
and a central committee for a Hawiyeh Tribe council that would be
a parallel and a challenging body for the joint alliance of
Mogadishu's leaders including Ali Mahdi Mohamed, Hussein Mohamed
Aidid and Mohamed Qanyareh Afrah.
</P>
<P>
However, sources close to the conference said four members
have come out for the candidacy of the leadership post. The
candidates include the leader of the hosting clan, Colonel Omar
Hashi Aden from the Hawadleh clan, Hussein Haji Bod from the
Abgal clan of Ali Mahdi Mohamed and two other minority leaders.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the misunderstanding is said to have risen after
 suspicion had come out that Hussein Hajji Bod was illegally
trying to over woo the votes of the clan delegates attending the
conference, something the hosting clan of Hawadleh did not like.
</P>
<P>
According to the sources, some of the leaders insisted that the
leadership should be chosen through the consensus of the clan
delegates attending the conference, while others preferred the
regular vote giving procedure.
</P>
<P>
However, Colonel Omar Hashi Aden, the Hawadleh clan main
candidate for the chairmanship post said the conference is still
continuing smoothly drawing close to its end and the election of
the chairman is planned to take place Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Colonel Aden said Bod and few other individuals have left the
conference, but their clan representatives are ready to vote
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
 The controversy has been continuing ever since it had
completed its traditional face and moved towards the moire
complicated political issue.

<HEADLINE> De Beers Diamond Sales Soar Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The sales realized 2.447 billion U.S. dollars compared to 1.7
billion dollars in the same period of 1998, De Beers said in
Johannesburg Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In rand (South African currency) terms, sales for the first
half of 1999 were 73.1 percent higher than the same period last
year.
</P>
<P>
The results were greeted with surprise and jubilation by
diamond analysts in Johannesburg, who believed that it augured
well for a repeat of the 1996 and 1997 full years when sales were
4.8 billion and 4.6 billion dollars respectively.
</P>
<P>
CSO sales of rough diamonds last year were well down at 3.345
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The CSO controls about 70 percent of the world's rough diamond
trade.
</P>
<P>
De Beers attributed the achievements to its restrictive rough
diamond supply policy and good sales performance in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
"The CSO has pursued a restrictive sales policy since the
Southeast Asian financial crisis in 1997 threatened the stability
of the market. This policy has allowed the diamond industry to
adjust to the changed economic circumstances and to de-stock in an
orderly fashion.
</P>
<P>
"The consequent low level of stocks in the cutting centers at
the beginning of 1999, coupled with a limited supply of rough from
non-CSO sources, the better than expected retail sales in the USA
over the Christmas period, continued consumer confidence in the
USA, and some tentative signs of recovery in the Far East, have
combined to create a better mood in the cutting centers."

"The Japanese and Southeast Asian markets, however, remain
depressed, although there are some signs that the worst may be
over. Global retail sales in 1999, although likely to be above
1998, are not likely to reach the levels of 1995 and 1996," it

<HEADLINE> Barak Reopens Coalition Talks With Likud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 22 (Xinhua) -- After weeks of suspension,
Israeli Prime Minister-elect Ehud Barak has reopened the coalition
 talks with the right-wing Likud Party in a bid to form a
broad-based government.
</P>
<P>
The negotiating teams of the Likud Party and Barak held a
full-scale talks on Tuesday afternoon. Before that, acting Likud
chief Ariel Sharon met with Barak late Monday.
</P>
<P>
Until now, it is still not clear whether Likud could join the
new government.
</P>
<P>
Sharon, who served as foreign minister under outgoing Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, told Likud senior official on
Tuesday morning that he had reached serious understandings with
Barak about the peace process and the formation of the new
government.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that Barak promised to give Likud the portfolio
of the foreign ministry or finance ministry if the party joins the
government.
</P>
<P>
Sharon told an assembly of Jewish Agency later that Barak and
he are trying to get Likud into the crucial decision-making for
the state in the coming years. He noted that they are not dealing
with the differences, but rather attempting to form a largest
possible national unity.
</P>
<P>
However, following Tuesday's meeting with Barak's negotiating
team, Likud minister Yaacov Katzav stressed it is impossible to
say that Likud is on its way to join the coalition government.
</P>
<P>
Katzav said that the two sides still have to bridge the wide
gaps over the Israeli-Palestinian peace process and the future
negotiations with Syria.
</P>
<P>
After his stunning victory in the May elections, Barak has
said he wants to establish a broad-based government to give him a
free hand in the peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Barak had held talks with Likud at the start of coalition
talks several weeks ago, but at the time failed to reach an
agreement on the peace issues.
</P>
<P>
Compared to the moderate stance of Barak, Sharon opposes
territorial concessions to Syria in the Golan Heights and wants
to keep most of the West Bank under Israeli control.
</P>
<P>
The coalition talks will continue and Barak is expected to
meet Sharon again on Tuesday night.

<HEADLINE> Egypt, Bahrain Term Arab Summit Necessary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Egypt and Bahrain wrapped up a
two-day summit meeting on Tuesday by calling for an Arab summit
and a resumption of the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
In a joint communique, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and
Bahraini Emir Sheikh Hamad Bin Isa al-Khalifa said that an Arab
summit is necessary to unify Arab ideas, Egypt's Middle East News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The pan-Arab summit proposal was issued by Mubarak and King
Hassan II of Morocco during the Egyptian president's visit on June
12-13 to the North African country.
</P>
<P>
Hopes of reviving the peace talks between Arab countries and
Israel increased after moderate Ehud Barak, leader of Israel's
Labor Party, won the May 17 elections. Arabs hope to adopt a
united stance on the peace process through a summit.
</P>
<P>
The last Arab summit was held in Cairo in 1996, after Israeli
hardliner Benjamin Netanyahu was elected as prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Hamad flew from Cairo in the day to Egypt's Red Sea
resort of Sharm el-Sheikh in southern Sinai, where he is to spend
a day before flying home on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In their call for the resumption of Arab-Israeli peace talks on
all tracks, the two leaders said Israel should withdraw from a
zone it occupies in southern Lebanon since 1985 and from Syria's
Golan Heights it captured in the 1967 Mideast War.
</P>
<P>
Peace talks involving Israel, Syria and Lebanon have been
stalled since February, 1996. Many Arab leaders hope that Barak
will jumpstart the talks.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Bahrain also called for an end to the suffering of
the Iraqi people resulting from United Nations economic sanctions
imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.

<HEADLINE> Major Military Exercise Under Way in Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Russia's biggest military exercise
since the end of the Cold War is under way, involving top military
officials across the entire territory of European Russia.
</P>
<P>
Colonel General Yuri Baluyevsky, head of the Department for
Operational Command of the Russian Armed Forces General Staff,
said at a press conference Tuesday that the exercise was not a
direct reaction to NATO's air strikes against Yugoslavia but the
events in the Balkans "were certainly taken into account in
planning."
</P>
<P>
The weeklong exercise, which started on Monday, was planned in
December last year, Baluyevsky said.
</P>
<P>
He said all forces of five military districts from the Black
Sea to the Arctic White Sea are involved now in the exercises
code-named Zapad (West) '99. "They are so-called top staff level
exercises involving 50,000 troops on the ground."
</P>
<P>
The North, Baltic and Black Sea fleets and about 20 commands of
formations of armed services and three formations of the Air Borne
Troops are also involved.
</P>
<P>
"The drill aims to upgrade the work of the command of the
Russian Armed Forces in cooperation with the command of other
military units and institutions of the Russian Federation,"
Baluyevsky said.
</P>
<P>
In addition to regular armed forces, a task force from
neighboring Belarus, troops of the Russian Interior Ministry,
units from the Federal Border Guard Service and the Ministry of
Emergencies will also take part in the exercise overseen by
Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev.
</P>
<P>
Delegates of Kazakhstan's armed forces will attend the exercise
as observers, Baluyevsky said.

</P>
<P>
HARHARE, June 22 (Xinhua) -- At least 12 million children die
in developing countries every year of diseases before they reach
the age of five, said an official of the World Health
Organization (WHO).
</P>
<P>
Visiting WHO Regional Secretariat Head Liz Mason Tuesday told
the Zimbabwe News Agency that seven out of 10 of the deaths were
caused by acute respiratory infections, diarrheas, measles,
malaria and malnutrition.
</P>
<P>
She said most of the children died during their first year of
life, calling for an integrated approach to the management of
childhood illness.
</P>
<P>
"Projections indicate that these conditions will continue to
be major contributors to child deaths unless significant efforts
are made to control them," she said.
</P>
<P>
 She said every day, millions of parents in the third world
sought health care for sick children but with little help.
</P>
<P>
 she said countries had learnt a lot from disease control
programs in the past years so they should use the programs to
promote coordination of disease prevention.
</P>
<P>
Mason said the other solution to prevent childhood illness was
to improve equity, efficiency, quality of care and effectiveness
of the medical sector.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Says Sanctions Kill Over 1.1 Million Iraqis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, June 22 (Xinhua) -- A total of 1,159,807 Iraqis have
died of all kinds of sanctions-related diseases since the
U.N. imposed harsh sanctions on Iraq in 1990, statistics released
Tuesday by the Iraqi Health Ministry show.
</P>
<P>
Those mortalities were caused by pneumonia, diarrhoea,
infantile malnutrition, heart diseases, hypertention, diabetes,
kidney and liver diseases and cancer, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The figures show that infants mortalities reached 92.7 cases
for every 1,000 births, and mortalities of pregnant mothers
reached 117 cases for every 100,000 live births.
</P>
<P>
Communicable diseases in 1998 including infantile paralysis,
diphtheria, measles, cholera, typhoid fever, whooping cough and
malaria increased sharply as compared to 1989 due to shortages of
medicine and medical appliances in addition to shortage of food.
</P>
<P>
The number of laboratory tests dropped severely during the
years of sanctions as compared to 1989 before the U.N. sanctions
were imposed on Iraq, the ministry said.

<HEADLINE> DPRK, U.S. Generals End Panmunjom Talks Without Results </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's Republic
of Korea (DPRK) and the United States Tuesday held general-level
talks at the truce village of Panmunjom on their naval gun battle
last week in the Yellow Sea. The talks ended without results amid
conflicting accusations.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK delegate said the area where the battle occurred is
located within Pyongyang's territorial waters, "either judged by
the truce or subsequent conventions."
</P>
<P>
"The north line," proposed by South Korea, violates the second
article of the 13th item of the 1953 truce, the KCNA news agency
quoted the delegate as saying.
</P>
<P>
The delegate accused the United States of adding its troops to
South Korea with the excuse of a DPRK "invasion" into South Korea'
s territorial waters.
</P>
<P>
He strongly condemned South Korea's continuous intrusions into
Pyongyang's territorial water from June 15 to the present. He
warned that those actions by the U.S. and South Korea would lead
the situation in the Korean peninsula "in a very dangerous
direction."
</P>
<P>
The chief representative of the U.S. troops stationed in South
Korea accused the DPRK of opening fire first; he proposed actions
to reduce tensions.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK's delegation immediately denied the accusation and
reaffirmed its stand that the U.S. and South Korea should take
full responsibility for the clash-- sternly punishing those
persons involved, and promising to prevent further such incidents
from occurring.

<HEADLINE> GCC, U.S. Discuss UAE-Iran Islands Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Representatives from Gulf
Cooperation Council (GCC) countries and the U.S. Tuesday discussed
the dispute between the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Iran over
three Gulf islands.
</P>
<P>
In a joint meeting held here, representatives from GCC states'
foreign ministries and the U.S. State Department called on Tehran
to accept the call by UAE President Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al-
Nahyan to solve the outstanding dispute, UAE's official WAM news
agency said.
</P>
<P>
Saif Saeed Bin Saed, UAE Foreign Ministry undersecretary and
head of the GCC representatives, said after the meeting that the
representatives reviewed the issue of regional countries' ties
with Iran, especially the policies of Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami and his overtures to improve ties with neighboring
countries.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. and GCC countries, including the UAE, Saudi Arabia,
Kuwait, Oman, Qatar and Bahrain, consider that the improvement of
ties with Iran should be linked to the solving of the islands
dispute between the UAE and Iran," he added.
</P>
<P>
The three small but strategic islands, namely Abu Musa and
Greater and Lesser Tunbs, are claimed by both the UAE and Iran but
have been controlled by Iran since 1971 when Britain retreated from
the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Martin Indyk, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Near East
Affairs who represented the U.S. side in the meeting, said that
the U.S. supported the UAE's call for a peaceful solution to the
dispute.
</P>
<P>
He said that the two sides had fruitful talks which covered the
security of the Gulf, Iraq, the Middle East peace process, the
developments between India and Pakistan as well as Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The UAE has just solved a quarrel with Saudi Arabia over the
latter's recent rapprochement with Iran, which was marked by
Iranian President Khatami's landmark visit to Riyadh in May.
</P>
<P>
The UAE accused Saudi Arabia of sacrificing its interests by
improving ties with Iran regardless of the UAE's dispute with the
country over the islands.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was called for by the UAE, the current chairman of
the GCC session. The GCC foreign ministers had agreed to hold the
meeting when they met with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright in New York last September, the WAM news agency said.

<HEADLINE> UK'S Blair Still Wants IRA Decommissioning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 22 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair, warned by Northern Ireland's main Protestant leader not
to give in on the issue of IRA weapons, remains fully committed
to the decommissioning of guerrilla arms, according to a
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
David Trimble, leader of the Ulster Unionist party and head
of the province's embryo executive, fired a series of warning
shots at Blair in an article in the Times, accusing him of
losing touch with the Protestant pro-British majority.
</P>
<P>
Trimble made clear he would not sit alongside the Irish
Republican Army's political wing Sinn Fein in a planned
power-sharing executive for the province unless the guerrilla
group handed over weapons.
</P>
<P>
Blair has set a June 30 deadline for rival Northern Ireland
politicians to break a deadlock over guerrilla disarmament which
has paralysed the peace process since the 1998 Good Friday
Agreement.
</P>
<P>
Blair's official spokesman told journalists that the prime
minister "has always made clear that decommissioning is part of
this agreement and that is as strong today as when we reached
the Good Friday Agreement."
</P>
<P>
Blair and Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern have both
cancelled trips to Latin America next week in order to bridge
the gap between the parties before the deadline.
</P>
<P>
Tension is rising in the province and the British army
announced on Tuesday that 1,300 troops who had been withdrawn
from Northern Ireland would return there in time for the
troubled "marching season", according to local media reports.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Curbs Use of Disease-Causing Substance in Pig Farms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Thai authorities have tightened
control on a pharmaceutical substance, which has been improperly
used by pig farms and could cause high blood pressure, the Thai
News Agency (TNA) quoted the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as
saying Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
FDA Secretary-General Dr. Mongkol Na Songkhla said the
administration had cooperated with the Department of Livestock
Development to monitor imports and use of the substance, known as
Salbutamol.
</P>
<P>
"The substance is a pharmaceutical product in the B-agonist
group used to make anti-asthma products, but has been misused by
local farmers to feed livestock, particularly pigs, so that they
will have less fat and give reddish meat," Mongkol was quoted by
TNA as saying.
</P>
<P>
Pork tainted with Salbutamol is harmful to consumers and will
damage Thailand's reputation and exports, he said.
</P>
<P>
The drug can cause high blood pressure and thus is harmful to
consumers with high blood pressure and heart disease.
</P>
<P>
FDA had instructed importers of B-agonist products to submit
their import lists to manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
Pig farm owners who use the substance as feed will face fines
ranging from 2,000 to 10,000 baht (54 to 270 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
FDA recently imposed a ban on imports and sales of suspected
dioxin-tainted meat and dairy products from some European
countries, which could cause cancer in humans.

<HEADLINE> British Pound Plunges To 21-Month Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The pound has fallen to its lowest
level against the dollar for almost two years after a minutes from
the Bank of England suggested there is further scope for cutting
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The minutes of the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee
meeting two weeks ago showed an unexpectedly strong eight-to-one
majority in favor of the quarter point reduction.
</P>
<P>
It also revealed the bank's fears that unless sterling were to
weaken, inflation could undershoot the government's target level
of 2.5 percent, raising the risk of a deflationary slump.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the minutes were released, sterling dropped to
1.5789 U.S. dollars. But it is still relatively strong against the
euro.
</P>
<P>
"With sterling remaining firm we see scope for another cut by
the end of the third quarter of 1999," said Jeremy Hawkins of the
Bank of America.
</P>
<P>
The decline in the pound against the dollar is seen as
beneficial for companies with heavy exposure in the U.S., such as
those in the pharmaceutical industry.
</P>
<P>
By contrast, firms like British Steel, which rely predominantly
on exports to the euro-zone, may be harder hit.

<HEADLINE> Better Policy Environment for Overseas Investors: Minister (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 23 (Xinhua) -- China is endeavoring to create a
more stable and favorable policy environment, and a more fair and
open competition environment for overseas investors, according to
Chinese Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC)
Shi Guangsheng.
</P>
<P>
The minister was speaking to dozens of overseas investors in
Beijing and northern China port city of Tianjin at two separate
forums in the past two days.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of some 30 overseas-funded companies in Beijing
and another 20 in the Tianjin attended the two forums.
</P>
<P>
Many overseas investors said at the forums that China's policy
of reform and opening up to the outside world has provided them
with rare chances to develop their business in China. Many
reported that they have gained good economic returns and have
already established their regional research and development
centers in China, or are planning to do so.
</P>
<P>
But they complained to the Chinese minister about a number of
issues concerning tariffs, import quotas and other problems that
they encounter in their operations.
</P>
<P>
Shi assured them that China will never change its opening-up
policy, as it has proved beneficial to both the country and
overseas investors over the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
So far, more than 320,000 overseas-funded businesses have been
established in China, involving an actual investment volume of
over 270 billion U.S. dollars. More than half of them have started
business and reported smooth operations, according to the minister.

KUNMING, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Three people in southwest China's
Yunnan Province have been sentenced to prison terms of from three
to five years for illegally unearthing and selling dinosaur
fossils.
</P>
<P>
Dinosaur fossils are under state protection in China.

<P>
Located 110 km from Yunnan's capital of Kunming, Lufeng has
been known for its abundant fossils of prehistoric creatures since
the first one was excavated in 1938.
</P>
<P>
Local departments responsible for relic protection have
established a complete system for discovery, reporting and
registration of fossils. They also carry out widespread publicity
work to educate the local people on fossil protection.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's GDP Contracts 1.3 Percent in 1st Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's gross domestic
product (GDP) contracted 1.3 percent year-on-year in the first
quarter of this year based on the new statistical base year of
1987 and a new methodology for calculation.
</P>
<P>
Announcing this Wednesday, Bank Negara (the National Bank of
Malaysia) Governor Tan Sri Ali Abul Hassan Sulaiman said the first
quarter GDP would have contracted 1.6 percent, as mentioned by
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad recently using a previous
methodology and the statistical base year of 1978.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint press conference by the central bank and
the Department of Statistics, Ali Abul said however the country is
already out of its recession judging from the GDP growth of 1.4
percent registered in the February to March period compared with
the year-earlier period.
</P>
<P>
"January wasn't good as manufacturing production was down
substantially," he said. "February and March registered a 1.4
percent growth so we've got positive growth and we are already out
of the recession," Ali Abul added.
</P>
<P>
He said that the first quarter marked the end of negative GDP
growth and four consecutive quarters of contraction, and that the
second quarter GDP growth would return to the plus territory.
</P>
<P>
"The third and fourth quarter GDP growth would not only be
positive but substantially stronger," the governor said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the overall GDP performance for this year would
be better than the 1-2 percent forecast with the manufacturing
sector leading the country out of the recession.
</P>
<P>
"I am not going to revise Bank Negara's official figures of 1
percent growth for 1999 although a lot of foreign research houses
have been placing the GDP growth figure for Malaysia at higher
levels," he said.  "The higher forecasts of many agencies could
materialize."
</P>
<P>
"We can expect much higher growth in the second and third
quarter," he said, adding that "fund managers have indicated more
than 2 percent growth this year."
</P>
<P>
Ali Abul said the manufacturing sector, which is second to the
services sector in terms of contribution to the GDP right now,
would overtake the services sector in no time and account for one
third of this year's GDP growth.
</P>
<P>
He explained that signs of recovery in the economy, first seen
in the last quarter of 1998, strengthened in the first quarter of
this year.
</P>
<P>
Indicators showed favorable developments in both the external
sector and domestic economic conditions, he added.
</P>
<P>
Among key indicators that continued to strengthen in the first
quarter were the trade balance position which stood at a
substantial surplus of 15.8 billion ringgit (4.16 billion U.S.
dollars), and export growth which improved further by 4.6 percent
in U.S. dollar terms.
</P>
<P>
International reserves of Bank Negara reached 31.3 billion
dollars as of June 15, sufficient to finance 6.9 months of
retained imports, while inflation moderated to 4 percent and
consumer and investor confidence gained strength with car sales
picking up strongly.
</P>
<P>
Ali Abul also said the retrenchment rate moderated further and
loan approvals by banks for the manufacturing and construction
sectors continued to increase.
</P>
<P>
The minus 1.3 percent growth in GDP in the first quarter of
this year reflected a significant moderation in the contraction
seen in recent quarters following the onset of the Asian financial
and economic crisis, he added.
</P>
<P>
It reflected a turnaround in manufacturing output which
increased by 4.6 percent in February and March, partially
offsetting the decline in January.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Pilots to Widen Strikes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Pilots at Cyprus Airways, the
national carrier, announced they are scheduled to launch a 48-hour
work stoppage at midnight Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The pilots ended at midnight Tuesday a 24-hour strike,
grounding the airline's flights and disrupting the travel plans
of 3,000 people.
</P>
<P>
The pilots' union announced Tuesday night that as a sign of
good will, a 24-hour rest was in place "to allow the interested
parties to take substantial action to solve the problem once and
for all."
</P>
<P>
The union said the strike has been inevitable as the company
has reneged on an agreement on the way captain vacancies in
Eurocypria, the charter subsidiary of Cyprus Airways, should be
filled.
</P>
<P>
The company said collective agreements signed with unions
clearly stated that Eurocypria pilots have priority.
</P>
<P>
A Cyprus Airways spokesman said the strikes are "illegal," and
described the staging of further strikes as an "ultimatum and
provocation."
</P>
<P>
The government has also expressed outrage over the pilots'
decision to further widen the strikes.
</P>
<P>
Commerce, Industry and Tourism Minister Nicos Rolandis said the
decision was "unacceptable and sad" and warned that the government
will press on with air liberalization.
</P>
<P>
And Labor and Social Insurance Minister Andreas Moushouttas
said the strike "is illegal, irrational and constitutes a
blackmail."

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Two people were killed and 13
others wounded when a crowded bus hit an anti-tank mine Wednesday
in Georgia's troubled province of Abkhazia.
</P>
<P>
Two children were among the wounded in what authorities
believed was a deliberate terrorist act, the Itar-Tass news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The incident happened at about 09:30 GMT in the Gali district
of Abkhazia, Tass quoted the district administration's Deputy
Chief Valery Lomiya as saying.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, separatists seized control of Abkhazia, forcing many
ethnic Georgians to flee the area.
</P>
<P>
A Russian peacekeeping force, under the authority of the
Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), has been stationed in
Abkhazia since 1994 with the consent of the government of Georgia
and Abkhaz separatists.
</P>
<P>
U.N. observers are also present in Abkhazia, although their
activities and those of CIS peacekeepers have been circumscribed
by increasing guerrilla activities such as planting landmines.

<HEADLINE> Arafat, Mubarak to Discuss Mideast Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
will arrive in Cairo on Thursday to consult with Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak on the Middle East peace process,
Palestinian ambassador to Egypt said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Arafat's upcoming visit bears "great importance" as it comes
prior to Mubarak's scheduled trip to the United States later this
month, Zuhdie al Qedra was quoted by Egypt's Middle East News
Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak is due to kick off a week-long visit to the U.S. on
Saturday, during which he is expected to discuss with
U.S. President Bill Clinton the Mideast peace process now that
Ehud Barak, moderate leader of Israel's Labor Party, has been
elected as prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, a frequent visitor to Egypt, is believed to coordinate
with Mubarak stances on the Palestinian-Israeli peace talks, which
made little progress under Barak's predecessor, hardliner Benjamin
Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Qedra praised Mubarak's efforts and support for the
Palestinians to secure their legitimate rights, including the
establishment of an independent state with Jerusalem as the
capital.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Ruling Party Celebrates Jubilee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's ruling Awami League
(AL), the oldest and largest political party of the country that
led the nation to independence in 1971, celebrated its golden
jubilee Wednesday, which coincided with the third anniversary of
the AL's return to power in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The year-long nation-wide jubilee program began with placing
wreaths at the portrait of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, one of the
founders of the party and father of incumbent Prime Minister
Sheikh Hasina, who was assassinated in August 1975.
</P>
<P>
Hasina also joined the inaugural ceremony of a three-day gala
function in the afternoon, together with party leaders and workers
from across the country, and more than 20 invited guests from
abroad including former Indian prime minister I.K. Gujral.
</P>
<P>
In a message issued on the eve of the event, Hasina urged the
partymen to take a fresh vow to bring smile on the faces of the
distressed.
</P>
<P>
She urged them to offer their dedicated services to face the
challenges of the 21st century and build Bangladesh into a
self-reliant and prestigious country.
</P>
<P>
"On this day of the golden jubilee, I recall with deep respect
the founder president of the party... Maulana Abdul Hamid Khan
Bhashani, Hossain Shahid Suhrawardy and Father of the Nation
Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman... who spread the ideals of the
party at every doorstep for flourishing the Bengali nationalism,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
AL presidium member Amir Hossain Amu, also convenor of the
Golden Jubilee Celebration Committee, told reporters that the
celebrations were aimed at taking political pledges to face the
challenges of the 21st century and prepare the nation for ensuring
people's rights.
</P>
<P>
"It is a great occasion for reminiscence on our struggle, pride
and heritage and also for taking fresh vow to continue people's
struggle for ensuring a hunger- and illiteracy-free country in the
coming century," he said.
</P>
<P>
Founded originally as the Pakistani Awami Muslim League in
1949, the AL assumed its present name in 1952 and ruled Bangladesh
after its independence in 1971 till 1975.

<HEADLINE> Iran Air to Resume Flights to Beirut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Iran Air, the Iranian national
carrier, announced on Wednesday that it would resume flights to
Beirut, capital of Lebanon after two decades of break.
</P>
<P>
The airlines has scheduled two flights a week to Beirut as
of Sunday, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The decision came after Lebanon's Middle East Airlines (MEA)
resumed flights to Iranian capital Tehran last month.
</P>
<P>
The resumption of the flight will help Iran expand its
relations with other Islamic countries and will facilitate Shiite
Muslims in Lebanon to pay pilgrimage to the holy shrines in Iran,
Iran Air said.
</P>
<P>
It also noted that the resumption of flights was envisaged in
an agreement reached between the two countries during their joint
economic commission last autumn.
</P>
<P>
The flights between Iran and Lebanon were suspended after
Iran's Islamic revolution in 1979.

<HEADLINE> Music Helps Judges Handle Cases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, June 23 (Xinhua) -- A group of Chinese judges play it
cool with guitars, clarinets and saxophones every Saturday evening
if they happen to have no people to jail.
</P>
<P>
These amateur musicians, from the Tianjin No.1 Intermediate
People's Court in north China, believe that performing music will
make them trendy and help them to handle cases more easily.
</P>
<P>
"As judges, we are under extremely high pressure every day. So
we established this band in the hope that it will relax us," said
Hua Yong, the clarinetist of the band.
</P>
<P>
Hua could not read music when she joined the band, which was
established in September last year. But now she is able to perform
six melodies.
</P>
<P>
The 40-member band has a teacher from the Tianjin Song and
Dance Troupe, Wang Shaohua, who praises her learned pupils.
</P>
<P>
Li Baoming, the saxophone player of the band and a specialist
in intellectual property rights section, said that he even tries
cases to the rhythm of music.
</P>
<P>
"We judges always appear to be cold, hard, stiff and stern,
But musicians are different," said the judge, grinning, adding
that they have all become more adroit at their work and handled
more cases since they started the band.
</P>
<P>
The band's oldest player is 57, and the youngest is 27. Even
three vice-presidents of the court have joined it.

<HEADLINE> Danish Cycling Union Finds Doping Widespread among Members </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Ten percent of Denmark's
competitive cyclists have admitted to having tried banned
performance enhancing drugs and 28 percent said they knew how to
acquire the substances, according to a new Danish survey.
</P>
<P>
The news comes amidst a deluge of publicity of doping within
the sport, set off by a scandal at last year's Tour de France.
</P>
<P>
Seeking to map the extent of the problem at home, the Danish
Cycling Union had its 1,409 licensed racers polled. The results
released Tuesday were based on nearly 1,000 responses.
</P>
<P>
"One of the conclusions is there are too few doping checks,"
union representative Jesper Worre said in an interview broadcast
by Danish radio on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The union said four of Denmark's top 18 cyclists admitted
having used banned substances. Among junior cyclists, 42 percent
said they would be willing to resort to doping.
</P>
<P>
The union noted that young cyclists which test positive for
drugs would face lifetime bans from Denmark's national cycling
team.

<HEADLINE> 2 Lebanese Civilians Wounded in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Two Lebanese civilians were
wounded Wednesday in an Israeli bombardment on villages in south
Lebanon, the Voice of the People radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Abdelhadi Fahs, 70, and Ali Zahweh, 12, were injured when
their house in the village of Kabrikha on the north of the
Israeli occupied border zone in south Lebanon, was hit by an
Israeli shell.
</P>
<P>
The attack came as a response to previous operations launched
by guerrillas of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God,
on Israel's positions inside the occupied zone.
</P>
<P>
Late Tuesday night, a member of the pro-Israeli South Lebanon
Army (SLA) and a Lebanese civilian were killed in roadside
bombings by unidentified Lebanese guerrillas. An Israeli soldier
was wounded in the attacks.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon
in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from
Lebanese guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by
Hezbollah has been fighting to dislodge Israeli occupation forces
and its ally SLA out of the country.

<HEADLINE> No Danger of Immediate War: Pak Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Wednesday said that
there is no imminent danger of war with India, though it was ready
to counter any aggression.
</P>
<P>
Military spokesman Brigadier Rashid Qureshi, briefing the
journalists, said that there has been no Indian attack along the
international border in the last seven days, including Sialkot in
northeastern Punjab province, as reported by some media units.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that the Indians over the past two weeks have
put their forces on alert on occupied forward bases.
</P>
<P>
"They have put their strike aircraft, which we call more than a
defensive move. And they have put their defensive formation close
to the borders. They have not moved their strike formations close
to the borders," he explained.
</P>
<P>
He added that India has put their navy on alert in Arabian Sea
where they are doing exercises.
</P>
<P>
All this, he said, has forced Pakistan to take whatever
counter-actions. "If India wants to escalate the war, that is
their decision. Pakistan will not be surprised," he said.
</P>
<P>
Different from the Indians, Pakistan was not talking of war,
Rashid said, and that is a "deliberate effort" to avoid being
accused by the Indians of war-advocating.
</P>
<P>
On the situation on the Line of Control (LoC), Rashid said the
Indian army has continued their artillery firing and three Indian
attacks have been repulsed along the LoC at Chorbat La and
Drass-Kargil area in the last couple of days, during which 36
Indian soldiers lost their lives.
</P>
<P>
To date, at least 400 Indian soldiers were killed and about 750
others wounded in the conflicts which started in early May on the
LoC, according to Rashid.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the Indians suffered very heavy casualties
because the Pakistani army has occupied advantaged positions at
great heights on the LoC and can carry out accurate attacks on
Indian targets.
</P>
<P>
Besides considerable civilian casualties, Pakistan also
suffered loss of 76 soldiers and 80 others were injured during the
past six weeks, said Rashid.
</P>
<P>
During the last 24 hours, at least two civilians were killed
and other five wounded in Indian artillery shelling across the
LoC, he added.
</P>
<P>
A Pakistani patrol, which moved out at night at the LoC, lost
contact with the army on June 13, he noted, adding that there are
possibilities that they have been killed or captured by Indian
troops.
</P>
<P>
However, "there is not a single Pakistani position that has
been captured by the Indians," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
On Indian claim that it has taken some heights from the
Mujahideen (holy war fighters) in Drass-Kargil, Rashid said that
possibly is the tactic or strategy of the Mujahideen.
</P>
<P>
Being Kashmiris who are struggling for their own rights against
the Indian rule, "they captured some heights and then
disappeared," he said.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN to Strive for Drug-Free Region </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Home and interior ministers of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Wednesday vowed to
strive for a drug-free Southeast Asia and build a region of agreed
rules of behavior and cooperative measures to deal with
transnational crime as envisaged in the ASEAN Vision 2020.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN Vision 2020 was adopted at the Second ASEAN Informal
Summit in December 1997 in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
In a joint communique issued here Wednesday at the end of the
Second ASEAN Ministerial Meeting on Transnational Crime, the
ministers reiterated ASEAN's commitment to the realization of the
Joint Declaration on A Drug-Free ASEAN signed by ASEAN foreign
ministers in July 1998, affirming their resolve to eradicate
illicit drug production, processing, trafficking and use in ASEAN
by the year 2020.
</P>
<P>
The ministers pledged support for the call of the Sixth ASEAN
Summit in December 1998 to intensify individual and collective
efforts to address transnational crime, including the promotion
and strengthening of linkages among ASEAN institutional mechanisms
to fight drug abuse and trafficking.
</P>
<P>
The ministers also voiced support for the Hanoi Plan of Action
adopted in Hanoi, Vietnam, last September as the road map to
achieve the ASEAN Vision 2020, affirming ASEAN's full commitment
to strengthening regional collaboration and its regional capacity
to effectively combat transnational crime.
</P>
<P>
The Myanmar-hosted three-day Second ASEAN Ministerial Meeting
on Transnational Crime, which began Monday, was attended by home
and interior ministers of the 10 ASEAN countries -- Brunei,

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Closes Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Strong offshore buying pushed the
Australian dollar nearly half a U.S. cent higher Wednesday, with
the upcoming sale of a further stake in Australia's leading
telecommunications company Telstra also supporting the currency's
strength.
</P>
<P>
The news that the Australian Senate has supported the further
partial sale of the Australian federal government's stake in
Telstra Corp. sparked a rush to cover short positions.
</P>
<P>
At the close the Australian dollar was at 65.65 U.S. cents from
65.16 U.S. cents Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Economist Michael Workman said the previous sale of Telstra had
boosted the currency in November 1997 and a similar impact could
be expected this time around.
</P>
<P>
The government got the green light late Monday from the Senate
to proceed with a sale of 16.6 percent of Telstra, of which it
sold one third in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The government is expected to retain a 50.1-percent share of
Telstra.
</P>
<P>
At the close of the local session, the Australian currency was
also trading at 63.45 euro cents from 63.03 euro cents Tuesday,
and 80.05 Japanese yen from 79.48 yen.

<HEADLINE> Philippine President Signs Clean Air Act Into Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph Estrada
Wednesday signed into law the Clean Air Act which seeks to improve
the country's deteriorating air quality by imposing a ban on
incinerators nationwide and reducing pollutant contents in fuels.
</P>
<P>
Under the new law, incinerators will be phased out within the
next three years, although the government may welcome the use of
"state-of the-art environmentally-sound and safe non-burn
incinerators."
</P>
<P>
The measure also prohibits oil companies to dispense gasoline
fuel that contains more than 45 percent aromatics and 4 percent
benzene and seeks to further reduce aromatic contents to 35
percent and benzene to 2 percent by the year 2003.
</P>
<P>
Another salient feature of the law is the prohibition of the
manufacture, importation and sale of leaded gasoline and engines
and other components that require the use of leaded gasoline.
</P>
<P>
The law likewise mandates the creation of the Air Quality
Management Fund to be used for cleaning up and rehabilitation of
damaged ecosystems, and compensation for aggrieved parties in
cases involving damage to lives and property.
</P>
<P>
Under the measure, local government units shall be allowed to
monitor the implementation of a national ambient air standard and
provide their own plans for its effective implementation.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Reinforces Construction of Its "Silicon Valley" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese capital has kicked off
a massive project to reinforce construction of its Zhongguancun
area into a demonstration zone for high-tech industry.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Municipal Government held a meeting today to make
arrangements for the implementation of a decision made by the
State Council, China's highest governing body. The decision,
issued on Monday, recommends the building of a demonstration area
in the Zhongguancun area to spur the nation's hi-tech industry.
</P>
<P>
Dubbed as China's "silicon valley", Zhongguancun, located in
northwest Beijing, is home to nearly 5,000 private high-tech
businesses and dozens of academies and research institutes,
including Beijing and Qinghua universities, the most prestigious
universities of the country, as well as the Chinese Academy of
Sciences. About 1,100 of the world's top computer companies, such
as IBM, Microsoft, Compaq, Hewlett Packard and Mitsubishi, have
set up ventures in this area.
</P>
<P>
Beijing Mayor Liu Qi announced at the meeting a near-term goal
for the regional development, which will see the establishment of
a technological renovation center covering 75 sq km and a 280-sq-
km industrial development area.
</P>
<P>
The economic growth rate of the area will be kept around 20
percent each year, which may enable the area's gross domestic
product (GDP) to reach 130 billion yuan (about 16 billion U.S.
dollars) by the year 2010, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
The mayor also promised some preferential policies in a bid to
create a better environment for hi-tech personnel, private
investment in hi-tech industry, and freer flows of information and
capital.

<P>
NEW DELHI, June 23 (Xinhua) -- India's caretaker Commerce
Minister R. Hegde Wednesday said that the Kargil conflict has so
far not affected India's trade with Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
"The military confrontation in Kargil has so far not adversely
affected our trade and commerce with Pakistan, but it will
definitely be hit if the situation snowballs into full-fledged
war," he told newsmen in Patna city, 1,015 kilometers southeast of
New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
India launched a big-scale military operation from early May
this year in Kargil sector of Kashmir to "flush out
Pakistan-backed infiltrators" and since then the Indo-Pak
relations have become more tense.
</P>
<P>
Hegde said that neither of the two countries would like to
engage in a war as it would be detrimental to the interests of
both.
</P>
<P>
The volume of official trade between the two countries was
nominal, yet the unofficial trade was nearly 200 times more, he
further said.
</P>
<P>
"Our economy will most certainly be adversely affected by a
war, but for Pakistan it will prove disastrous," Hegde added.

<HEADLINE> Iran Lashes out at U.S. over Weapons Allegation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Iran on Wednesday lashed out at
the United States for its allegation on Tehran's weapon programs
and termed the U.S. move "ineffective and useless."
</P>
<P>
Tehran's anger came after U.S. Assistant Secretary of State
for Near East Affairs Martin Indyk, who was currently in Abu
Dhabi, the United Arab Emirates, accused Iran of developing
weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi said that
the U.S. "destructive" approach aimed at diverting public opinion
from the threats of Israel and selling more arms to regional
states, are "inefficient and useless."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. administration is accusing Iran of developing weapons
of mass destruction while it is the main supplier of mass
destruction weapons and nuclear arms to Israel which possesses
the largest arsenal in the region, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that some American circles who are against
rapprochement between Iran and regional states are raising such
"baseless" allegations to block convergence in the region, the
Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, spokesman of the Iranian Defense Ministry Keywan
Khosrawi said that the U.S. government is raising "routine and
unfounded" allegations to prevent Persian Gulf states from
expanding their relations and building an atmosphere of
understanding in the region.
</P>
<P>
Dismissing Indyk's remarks as "unrealistic," he said that
Iran's defense activities aimed at building up domestic defense
capability are legitimate and acceptable.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. provocative approach in the Gulf region has once
again unveiled Washington's interventionist policy to escalate
tension in the region and to seek a pretext for its unnecessary
military presence in the region, Khosrawi said.
</P>
<P>
He underlined that expansion of brotherly and strategic
relations among the regional states is irreversible.
</P>
<P>
Iran and the U.S. have been engaged in a decade-long wordy war
over Iran's weapon programs.
</P>
<P>
Washington termed Tehran's effort to develop weapons of mass
destruction as a threat to the Gulf states and the U.S. interest
in the region.
</P>
<P>
But Iran repeatedly argued that the U.S. military presence in
the Gulf is the real threat to the region's security and
stability.

</P>
<P>
They include 13 senior folk painting masters, 55 folk painting
masters and 98 folk painters.
</P>
<P>
The move is an effort to protect the valuable handicrafts
traditions in Yunnan, which is known for the colorful lifestyles
of its 26 ethnic groups and their traditional skills in
handicrafts of different styles.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, however, the number of ethnic handicrafts
makers has been diminishing, and there is a danger that some
skills may disappear.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, with the help of Columbia University in the United
States, the province began its program to revive and protect
handicrafts.
</P>
<P>
Currently, there are over 10,000 registered handicrafts makers
across the province.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Can Only Accept if U.N. Conducts Vote in East Timor on August 21: Presidential Aide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President B.J. Habibie
does not find it acceptable if U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan
delays conducting the direct ballot on the U.N.-sponsored autonomy
package in East Timor above August 21, a presidential aide said
here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"If the vote is not conducted on August 21, President Habibie
will not accept it, because (if the date is beyond August 21) he
will be too hurried to prepare everything needed for his
accountability speech in the upcoming general session of the
People's Consultative Assembly (MPR)," presidential aide Dewi
Fortuna Anwar told reporters here.
</P>
<P>
She was commenting on Annan's announcement of a two-week delay
in the autonomy ballot in East Timor, which has previously been
set for August 8.
</P>
<P>
Annan said in a statement in Moscow and relayed to the U.N.
headquarters in New York on Tuesday that the ballot will go ahead
in the month of August, citing security and logistical concerns as
factors for the postponement.
</P>
<P>
Annan did not clarify the exact date of the popular
consultation on the wide-ranging autonomy that Jakarta has offered
in order to pave the way for the East Timorese to determine their
future.
</P>
<P>
A U.N. source in New York, however, told Antara News Agency
that the direct ballot might be conducted on August 21 or August
22.
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters in Dili, capital of East Timor, on
Wednesday, spokesman of the U.N. Assessment Mission in East Timor
David Wimhurst said Annan has postponed the direct ballot in East
Timor for two weeks to allow the U.N. mission to complete its
preparations and the security situation to improve.
</P>
<P>
U.N. special envoy for East Timor Jamsheed Marker has conveyed
the delay to Habibie and Foreign Minister Ali Alatas in Jakarta,
Wimhurst was quoted by Antara as saying.
</P>
<P>
Anwar said the Indonesian government can understand the
postponement as long as it does not disrupt the country's national
agenda, but prefers the vote to be carried out on August 21
(Saturday).
</P>
<P>
She said Jakarta sincerely respects those who would like to
attend church on Sunday (August 22), so it prefers the ballot (if
it must be delayed) be held on Saturday (August 21).
</P>
<P>
The direct ballot in East Timor will allow the territory's
people to choose whether their homeland should become an
autonomous region within Indonesia or totally independent. The
Indonesia government has announced that it would grant East Timor
independence if the people in the territory reject Indonesia's
offer of a wide-ranging autonomy.
</P>
<P>
East Timor, a former Portuguese colony, was integrated into
Indonesia in 1976 in a move never recognized by the United
Nations, which still considers Portugal as the administering power
of the territory.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Explorer Completes Ride Across Lop Nur Desert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Huang Chengde from south China's
Guangdong Province, yesterday successfully completed his
motorcycle exploration tour across the Lop Nur Desert in the
eastern part of the Taklimakan Desert, China's largest.
</P>
<P>
Huang set off on June 12 from Dunhuang, an ancient city on the
legendary Silk Road in northwest China's Gansu Province and rode
his motorcycle over a distance of 2,140 kilometers to cross the
depopulated zone in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, also in
northwest China.
</P>
<P>
After overcoming difficulties caused by rolling sand hills,
losing his way, sand storms, high temperatures, dangerous insects
and a lack of fresh water, Huang finally arrived at Korla City in
the Bayingolin Mongolia Autonomous Prefecture, the end of the
desert.
</P>
<P>
The Lop Nur Desert is known worldwide, especially to explorers,
archeologists and geographers, for the mysterious disappearance of
Lop Nur Lake, which used to be the second-largest in China, as
well as a vanished ancient civilization.
</P>
<P>
The windy and scorching weather in June in the area creates an
ultimate challenge to human beings' physical and psychological
powers. There is a saying that "there can be no breakthrough in
June." Chinese scientist Peng Jiamu and explorer Yu Chunshun lost
their lives when they traveled there at that time of the year.
</P>
<P>
Huang is confident that his triumphant tour across the Lop Nur
has established a new world record.

<HEADLINE> PNG PM to Disband PNG First Party: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Papua New Guinean (PNG) Prime
Minister Bill Skate will disband his PNG First party to form two
other parties within his government, the prime minister's office
confirmed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Post-Courier newspaper reported Wednesday that Skate will
keep 22 PNG First members, who would revert to their former
identity, the People's National Congress.
</P>
<P>
Eleven PNG First MPs would go to the resurrected National Party
to be led by Western Highlands Governor Father Robert Lak.
</P>
<P>
Skate said disbanding PNG First and resurrecting the National
Party was for political stability and the survival of his
government.
</P>
<P>
He said that by promoting the National Party he was raising
leaders who would succeed him in the future.
</P>
<P>
PNG's 100-plus MPs are currently engaged in intense lobbying
and political jockeying before parliament resumes on July 13, when
Skate is expected to face a no-confidence motion.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Skate told reporters that the National Party,
which draws its support mostly from PNG's highlands, had a long
history in PNG and Skate wants to ensure the party is still alive.
</P>
<P>
"It's not like the government is breaking up," the spokesman
said.
"In many ways it just consolidates it because there's a lot more
even groups in the (government) coalition."

<HEADLINE> HK's Economic System Unchanged: HSBC Chairman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's economic system,
financial infrastructure, supervisory mechanism and legal system
all have remained unchanged since its return to the motherland on
July 1, 1997, testifying to the successful implementation of the "
one country, two systems" policy, according to a leading Hong Kong
banker.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Xinhua prior to the 2nd
anniversary of the establishment of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR), David Eldon, chairman of the Hongkong
and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC) Limited, the biggest of
the note issuing banks in Hong Kong, said of course, Hong Kong has
faced some tough challenges in the past two years because of the
economic crisis in Asia.
</P>
<P>
"However, Hong Kong has weathered the storm better than many of
its neighbors due to its strong economic fundamentals, sound
monetary policies and the resilience of its people," the banker
said.
</P>
<P>
Eldon, born in Scotland, started his banking career in 1964 and
took up his first position in Hong Kong in 1979 as manager of
special project in the head office of HSBC, which was established
in Hong Kong in 1865.
</P>
<P>
He was made an executive director of the bank in 1994, chief
executive officer in 1996 and chairman in January 1999.
</P>
<P>
Eldon holds a positive view about Hong Kong's economic trends
and prospects despite that he believes Hong Kong still faces tough
operating conditions.
</P>
<P>
The year 1999 remains a challenging year with a current GDP
forecast of zero growth, he said.
</P>
<P>
"For the near term, I expect the focus will remain on the
difficult and painful readjustment process," Eldon added.
</P>
<P>
"At the same time, we must not overlook the positive sectors:
Hong Kong resilience, its financial integrity and its unique
position relative to China's mainland, which continues to make
great economic strides," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
All these will ensure that Hong Kong will make good recovery,
Eldon believed.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on measures taken by the HK SAR government last
August against the activities of manipulation in the stock and
futures markets in Hong Kong, Eldon said that the SAR government
had taken timely actions to have maintained the economic stability
of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"HSBC supported the SAR government's actions and will, as
always, continue to stand with Hong Kong in future," he said.
</P>
<P>
Talking about HSBC's plans and visions for its China business,
Eldon said that HSBC has long-term commitment to China's inland
areas and will continue to expand its China business, focusing on
enlarging the branch network, investing in staff training and
technology and broadening business scope.
</P>
<P>
"We have applied to the authorities for approval to relocate
our mainland area management office to Shanghai," Eldon said. "The
relocation will strengthen the management and financial control of
the branch network in the mainland," he added.

Dondoux slammed the United States for "always being more than

"There should be a multi-polar world with several great
countries and several great organizations, including Europe, to
guide world trade. This is the fundamental stand of the government,

SINGAPORE, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's consumer price index
edged up marginally by 0.1 percent year-on-year in May 1999,
registering first increase since June 1998, Singapore Department
of Statistics (SDS) said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
SDS also said that the index rose by 0.4 percent over April
this year.
</P>
<P>
Compared to the previous month, SDS said, food prices went up
by 0.4 percent due mainly to dearer pork and fish which more than
offset cheaper vegetables.
</P>
<P>
In May, higher tuition fees at commercial institutions raised
the education index by 2.6 percent, cost of transport and
communication rose by 0.9 percent as a result of higher car and
petrol prices, prices of miscellaneous items and health cost edged
up by 0.2 percent and 0.1 percent respectively and clothing prices
dipped by 0.1 percent whilst housing cost remained stable.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, June 23 (Xinhua) -- China's minister of foreign trade
and economic cooperation, Shi Guangsheng, today urged enterprises
to expand exports by all means.
</P>
<P>
Shi said he believed China could realize growth in exports this
year if enterprises use their advantages as much as possible.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at a meeting with heads of over 20 export
and import enterprises in Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
After listening to their opinions and suggestions about how to
expand exports, Shi praised their successful practices such as
upgrading the technical value of exports, restructuring capital,
encouraging industries to engage in trade, making use of the
markets of developed nations, combining overseas investment with
foreign aid and developing new commodities.
</P>
<P>
He also placed importance on their suggestion about improving
the management of commodities.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that China's exports face difficulties because of
the tough world market and their own low level of competitiveness,
but stressed that they also have advantages.
</P>
<P>
The world economy is still growing, while China is also keeping
up fast growth, he said. The country encourages adding technical-
value to export goods, and will increase the tax return rates on
exports in accordance with international rules.
</P>
<P>
Shi encouraged all related sectors to improve the export
commodity mix and upgrade competitiveness.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Indian Minister Urges Preparedness for Eventuality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Indian caretaker Home Minister
L. K. Advani said Wednesday that India should be prepared for any
eventuality as "several centers of power make Pakistan an
irresponsible state."
</P>
<P>
"I cannot say there could not be a war and prudence demands
that the country should be ready to face any situation," he told
newsmen in Lucknow, 497 kilometers southeast of New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan would have to pay a stupendous price if it tried to
escalate the Kargil conflict (in Kashmir)," he said.
</P>
<P>
When asked whether there was any possibility of further talks
with Pakistan to resolve the issue, Advani said, "There could be
no meaningful talks unless the intruders vacate our land."
</P>
<P>
India launched a big military operation from early May to
"flush out Pakistan-backed infiltrators" from the Kargil sector of
Kashmir and the fighting is still going on. Both India and
Pakistan have accused each other of escalating the situation.
Foreign ministers of the two countries held talks here on June 12
over the dispute, yet the talks failed due to the wide gap between
them.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan maintains that Kargil or the Line of Control (LoC) in
Kashmir cannot be discussed in isolation to the Kashmir issue,
which is the "flash point" and "root cause" of tension between the
two countries. The two countries should discuss the whole Kashmir
dispute, Pakistan said.
</P>
<P>
India maintains that Kashmir is part of its territory and there
is no dispute over it.

<HEADLINE> WFP Suspends Relief Activities to C. Angolan City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations World Food
Program (WFP) has suspended its relief work in central Angola's
Huambo city due to renewed fierce fightings in the area.
</P>
<P>
Maria Flynn, WFP spokesman, was quoted by Wednesday's Angola
Daily as saying that since the opposition National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) forces have re-started
shelling in Huambo, the Huambo airport cannot guarantee safe
landing or taking off of the airplanes, therefore airlifting, the
only way of food relief for the besieged city, has to stop.
</P>
<P>
Reports said about 1,000 UNITA soldiers launched violent
attacks last Saturday on Caala city, 23 kilometers west of Huambo,
killing ten civilians and wounding another 16.
</P>
<P>
However, the government side claimed that its army has beaten
off the UNITA attacks, killing 20 UNITA soldiers and holding two
captive, in addition to seizing a large batch of weapons including
missiles and cannons.
</P>
<P>
According to the WFP official, the major international relief
institution has food stocks in Huambo which is only enough to last
for a few days. She hoped that the situation in Huambo would
improve so that its humanitarian relief work could resume.
</P>
<P>
Huambo and Caala cities are host to over 170,000 refugees,
which are the most refugee-intensive area in Angola at the moment.
</P>
<P>
Flynn also revealed that her organization's relief work in
Malanje Province in northern Angola has also stopped since the
road leading to the warring area remains "extremely dangerous".

<P>
LAGOS, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian Union of Teachers (NUT)

members to protest the non-payment of the approved 3,000 Naira
(about 315 U.S. dollars)
</P>
<P>
minimum monthly salary to civil servants nationwide.
</P>
<P>
At an emergency meeting of the National Executive Council (NEC)

to suspend the strike with immediate effect.
</P>
<P>
In a communique issued at the end of the NEC meeting and

national president and secretary respectively, the teachers
explained that the decision to call off the strike became
imperative in view of the progressive decisions reached at various
meetings with the government.
</P>
<P>
They stated that the federal government had released the sum of
4.5 billion Naira (47 million U.S. dollars) for the payment of
the minimum wage to primary school teachers throughout the country

<P>
Nonetheless, the massive efforts have failed to keep pace with
increasing highway transportation volume, according to Yang
Shengfu, former general engineer with the Ministry of
Communications.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that China's existing expressway system fulfills
a mere one-fourth of actual demand and stressed that construction
must be accelerated.
</P>
<P>
Experts predict that the development of China's highway freight
and passenger transportation volume will remain above the economic
growth level through the beginning of the new century.
</P>
<P>
In addition, transportation arteries linking medium-sized to
large cities and major ports, industrial centers and economic
development zones will witness increasing volumes.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Minister of Communications Li Juchang said China is
accelerating the construction of major national highways and both
north-south and east-west expressways.
</P>
<P>
Li's ministry recently released information indicating that
China's expressway mileage will hit 9,000 km by next year, with
the figure expected to grow to 21,600 km by 2020.

<P>
BEIJING, June 23 (Xinhua) -- China has significantly expanded
its expressway system over the past decade, but future
construction must be carried faster than economic growth in order
to meet the needs of the nation's sustainable economic development,
transportation experts said today.
</P>
<P>
Professor Zhao Yongzheng, with the Institute of Comprehensive
Transportation under the State Development and Planning Commission,
noted: "Preferential development of the transportation industry is
an objective demand for socialized production. Developed countries
have, in fact, placed priority to improving the industry in the
course of industrialization."
</P>
<P>
She said rapid economic development in the United States has
greatly benefited from the country's comprehensive transportation
network.
</P>
<P>
Zhao also attributed the swift recovery of the German economy
following World War II to the country's policy of allocating
massive funding for the construction of transportation
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
China commenced expressway construction in the mid-1990s, with
the current 6,258-km system ranking eighth in the world.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 23 (Xinhua) -- China's Index of Current Consumer
Economic Conditions (ICC) grew 1.2 points on a monthly basis to 87.
9 points in May, according to the National Bureau of Statistics (
NBS).
</P>
<P>
The NBS's China Business Climate Monitoring Center reported
that the rise indicated consumers are experiencing a psychological
change after a long period of taking a wait-and-see attitude.
</P>
<P>
Consumer indexes, including the Index of Consumer Expectation (
ICE), Index of Consumer Sentiment (ICS) and Index of Current
Economic Conditions (ICC), are used internationally as indicators
of economic situations and consumer confidence.
</P>
<P>
The May's ICE stood at 93.7 points, up 0.2 point on the April
figure and the ICS increased by 0.7 points to reach 91.4 points.
</P>
<P>
The NBS established its Consumer Survey System in December 1997
and lists the monthly ICE on a base of 100 points. The random
selection method means gathering 4,200 samples in Beijing,
Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu, Wuhan and Xi'an.
</P>
<P>
The survey indicated that 44 percent of respondents foresee
improving overall economic conditions in the next 12 months, and
another 44 percent of them also expressed confidence that the
Chinese economy will maintain stable growth over the next five
years.
</P>
<P>
Though consumers commented that their own current family
financial situation is unchanged, their attitude towards current
purchasing opportunity has changed. The survey shows that 48
percent of consumers say it is the best time to buy durable goods.
</P>
<P>
The report suggested that the government adopt effective
measures to expand consumption.

<HEADLINE> East China Province Spends Big Money Fighting Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The Province of Jiangsu in east
China spent a total of 2.1 billion yuan (about 250 million U.S.
dollars) in 1998 in its fight against pollution, three times the
amount of the previous year, according to a report on local
environmental conditions released by the provincial government
today.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the report says, Jiangsu has successfully removed
or effectively controlled a total of 2,064 pollution sources
across the province, most of which are industrial enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Located on the lower reaches of China's two major rivers, the
Huaihe and the Yangtze, and bordering on the Taihu Lake, the
country's third largest fresh water lake, Jiangsu has always faced
great challenges in the fight against water pollution.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, it cost the province 1.8 billion yuan to help some 1,
789 local industrial enterprises to clean up their sewage
discharges. Now more than 80 percent of the industrial waste water
the province generates each year, equaling nearly 1.7 billion tons,
are purified before flowing into rivers and lakes, the report says.
</P>
<P>
The province last year also spent more than 300 million yuan to
curb the increasingly serious air pollution caused by factories
and automobiles. A total of 275 air pollution control projects
were completed with this money.
</P>
<P>
The report also mentions that many of the major cities in
Jiangsu, including the provincial capital of Nanjing and Suzhou,
Wuxi, Changzhou, Zhenjiang and Xuzhou, have banned the use of
leaded gas by cars and have started to take measures to control
auto emissions.
</P>
<P>
This year Jiangsu will further increase its financial input in
the local anti-pollution battle, the report notes.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Company Offers Antidote to "Worm Virus" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 23 (Xinhua) -- China's leading anti-virus company,
the Rising Computer Technology, has issued new software containing
an antidote to the new worm virus that swept through the Internet
early this month.
</P>
<P>
It has passed tests applied by the Ministry of Public Security,
the watchdog of China's anti-virus sector.
</P>
<P>
It has been reported that the virus, Worm.
Explore.Zip, arrives by e-mail with a friendly message: "Hi, (
Recipient Name)! I received your e.mail and I shall send you a
reply ASAP (as soon as possible). Till then, take a look at the
attached zipped docs."
</P>
<P>
The virus actually isn't dangerous unless the computer user
opens the "zipped docs," a term referring to a compressed file
sent along with the e-mail. By opening that file, a computer user
inadvertently activates the virus.
</P>
<P>
The virus then worms its way into the computer user's e-mail
program and sends a copy of itself to the address of any e-mail
that subsequently arrives.
</P>
<P>
It also hunts through a computer's hard drive and deletes the
information in files created by popular software programs,
including Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel.
</P>
<P>
There has been no detailed report of the damage incurred by the
worm in China, but the virus attacked a huge number of computers
abroad after the outbreak on June 10.

sacked physiotherapist Rick Keyaerts following last Thursday's
discovery by customs officers on the Franco-Belgian border of
creatine and other legal substances in an official Festina team
car he was driving, according to reports from Barcelona.
</P>
<P>
The team, which has painstakingly rebuilt its reputation since
they were expelled from last year's Tour de France after then team
boss Bruno Roussel admitted to systematic dopetaking within the
outfit, took the action despite creatine not being on the list of
substances banned by the International Cycling Union (UCI) or the
International Olympic Committee (IOC).
</P>
<P>
A Festina spokesperson said:"Rick Keyaerts was transporting the
products without permission of the team."
</P>
<P>
He Added that "Although they were not illegal substances it is
totally against team rules for anyone other than the team doctor
to carry such products in a team car."
</P>
<P>
French customs, based in Valenciennes in northern France,
confirmed on Wednesday that none of the other products found in
the car were illegal and corresponded to a treatment for one rider
over a period of three months.

XINING, June 23 (Xinhua) -- One person was killed and another
injured in a hailstorm which hit northwest China's Qinghai
Province on Sunday, bringing the death toll caused by recent
natural disasters throughout the province to 28.

About 25,000 people in Huangyuan and Gonghe counties were

insufficient preparations.

More than 6,000 architects from around the world are attending

Li said that human beings have witnessed great progress since
the beginning of this century. He pointed to monumental
development in the realm of science and technology, social
productivity and living standards of the people throughout the
world.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the century has witnessed a number of disasters,
including the two catastrophic world wars which caused
immeasurable damage to the well-being of people worldwide, said Li.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, according to the senior Chinese leader, mass
construction has greatly influenced the environment and created a
menace threatening the existence and development of human society
itself.
</P>
<P>
He urged all people to consider the situation and blaze new
trails in sustainable development.
</P>
<P>
Li noted that architects have made great contributions
throughout history and called for new creations in modern times.
</P>
<P>
He also underscored the need for harmonious development between
human beings and the environment.
</P>
<P>
Architects must appropriately handle relations between human
beings and the environment, and must stress national and regional
characteristics in the process of globalization, he said.

<HEADLINE> Minister of Land Resources Calls For Intensive Use of Land </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 23 (Xinhua) -- China needs to use its land
resources more intensively in the face of the growing population
and the declining amount of arable land, a senior official said
here today.
</P>
<P>
China's arable land has been declining at a considerable speed
in recent years and the per capita availability of arable land in
the middle of next century will be reduced to less than one mu, (
one-fifteenth of a hectare), if the downward trend remains
uncurbed, Minister of Land Resources Zhou Yongkang told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Zhou attributed the reduction of arable land to the waste of
land during construction and fallow of land across the country,
rural areas in particular.
</P>
<P>
"Under such circumstances, a solution to the shortage of land
is to use the land resources more efficiently and intensively,"
Zhou said. Some four million hectares of land may be saved for
construction from the fallow land, and another 15 million hectares
could be reclaimed from the waste and deserted land.
</P>
<P>
"To do this, the government has to initiate tight regulations
for land use and impose strict restrictions on the non-farming use
of land," Zhou said, adding that protection of land resources will
go along with the intensive utilization and exploration of the
land.

SHANGHAI, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Customs officials in Shanghai
recently seized 53 fossilized dinosaur eggs hidden in a cargo
container labeled as "old furniture".
</P>
<P>
Customs officials at the Waigaoqiao Bonded Zone in the Pudong
New Development Zone found the fossils earlier this month in 130-
odd pieces of classical furniture.

PARIS, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers on Wednesday:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The United Nations Security Council is widely divided over
the lifting of the economic sanctions against Iraq. Besides China
and Russia, France is opposed to the U.S.-backed British-Dutch
proposal on a suspension of oil embargo with a renewable period of
120 days in connection with an implementation of disarmament by
Baghdad. Paris wants a total lifting of economic sanctions on
Iraq once it meets the U.N. requirement of disarmament.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- According to a poll published recently, the French people
are more divided by an inequality of living standard than most
other Europeans. While members of the country's high income class
spend more than their European counterparts, the spending sum of
low-income people in France is below the average of other
Europeans.
</P>
<P>
-- While the memory of Holocaust has not evaporated, the Jews
are returning to Berlin believing in a bright future. As many Jews
from the former Soviet Union are emigrating to the German capital,
the city's Jewish community has expanded from 29,000 a few years
ago to the present 75,000.

<HEADLINE> Fujian To Boost Deep-Sea Fishing Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, June 23 (Xinhua) --In a bid to turn around the fortunes
of its ailing deep-sea fishing industry, Fujian Province in east
China has drawn up a long term development plan and will increase
investment in the sector.
</P>
<P>
Since 1985, the province has invested 700 million yuan in
setting up 50 deep-sea fishing enterprises, but there have been
many problems caused mostly by poor management and low efficiency
resulting in smaller than expected returns.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, a total of more than 900 deep-sea
trawlers had been dispatched to West Africa, South America, South
Asia and other areas, bringing home a total catch of 600,000 tons,
which was not considered satisfactory.
</P>
<P>
The province's first ever working conference on deep-sea
fishing agreed that an all out effort must be made to ensure its
steady and sustained growth and part of the plan means that by the
year 2005, the number of Fujian's deep-sea fishing vessels will
number 200.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Consumers Rebel Against "Minimum Charges" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Chinese consumers and market
watchdogs are urging an immediate ban on the so-called "minimum
charges" in the service sector so as to promote fair competition
and protect consumers' interest.
</P>
<P>
Setting up unauthorized bottom-line expense standards is quite
a common phenomenon in the service sector, food in particular.
Restaurant owners and bar tenders usually demand that customers
pay a certain "minimum fee" if they want to dine or enjoy services
on their premises.
</P>
<P>
For a quite cheap restaurant, the minimum charge is usually set
at 100-200 yuan (around 12-24 U.S. dollars9, but if consumers want
to dine in a special room with KTV facilities, the charge is often
more than 1,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Beijing is leading the country in banning such irrational
charges. Regulations against it have already been drawn up and
will take effect on September 1.
</P>
<P>
Under the regulations, consumers have the right to demand
double-the-price compensation if they encounter such cases.
</P>
<P>
Han Ming, an official with the State Administration of Internal
Trade, said that the so-called minimum charge was an offspring of
the food sector at its juvenile development stage, when the number
of restaurants and bars were much fewer than the actual need.
</P>
<P>
"The shortage situation gave restaurant owners the opportunity
to impose this unreasonable demand," she added.
</P>
<P>
Now the minimum charge standard has also spread to other
service fields, including culture and entertainment. Han stressed
that such practices in these areas should also be banned.
</P>
<P>
Actually, China's Law on Protecting the Rights and Interest of
Consumers clearly states that consumers have the right to choose
where to spend their money and how much to spend.
</P>
<P>
Ma Huaide, a professor at a prestigious law university in
Beijing, suggested that it would be more favorable for consumers
if a special law is introduced to ban such illegal practices,
because in that case, all branches in the service sector can be
covered.

<HEADLINE> French Interior Minister Opposes Legalizing Minority Tones </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 23 (Xinhua) -- French Interior Minister Jean-Pierre
Chevenement said on Wednesday that to give the minority tones in
some French regions a constitutional protection could lead to a ``
Balkanization'' of the country.
</P>
<P>
Agence France-Presse quoted Chevenement as saying that he
rejects any move which ``replaces the notion of French People with
other hazy concepts that have something to do with ethnic origins.
''
</P>
<P>
The French Constitutional Council recently refused to adopt the
European Charter on Minority Languages, saying that some of its
articles contradict with the French Constitution, which does not
recognize the existence of minority groups in France.
</P>
<P>
The French language is the only written language in France,
although there are some minority tones in the French regions like
Bretagne and Corsica.
</P>
<P>
Chevenement said that he believes the sporadic bombing attacks
by a separatist phantom group of Bretagne, western France, and
Corsican separatists against public properties could be linked
with the calls for a constitutional recognition of minority tones
by some people in France.
</P>
<P>
``It is better to preserve France as a community of citizens,
that is the Republic, rather than re-create the identities with
ethnic implications,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Romania's President Presents National Security Strategy to Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Romania's President Emil
Constantinescu Wednesday morning presented a document on national
security strategy before the joint Chambers of Parliament.
</P>
<P>
The document, forwarded to the Parliament as a political
message, was endorsed last Friday by the Supreme Defense Council,
the country's highest institution in charge of national security.
</P>
<P>
The necessity of rediscussing national security strategy is
compulsory as regional issues have significantly changed since the
first version of this strategy was drafted in the 1998 summer,
Constantinescu said.
</P>
<P>
According to the document, the national security strategy seeks
targets as: guaranteeing the fundamental rights and freedoms of
the citizens, the defense of the sovereignty and independence of
Romania, the consolidation of the order of law, the improvement of
the people's living standards as well as Romania's clear option
for integration with NATO and the European Union.
</P>
<P>
The document also points out that in order to be able to
fulfill its foreign policy targets, Romania has to go on with its
economic reform program.
</P>
<P>
Based on observations on the regional evolution, the strategy
approaches two new priorities with regard to the national interest:
Romania's participation in ensuring security and stability in
Europe and the consolidation of a democratic regime resting on the
observance of the country's constitution and of the prevalence of
law.

<HEADLINE> China, Latin America Exploiting Business Potential (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 23 (Xinhua) -- More than a dozen high-ranking
Latin American officials are now gathering in Chengdu, capital of
southwest China's Sichuan Province, discussing with Chinese
entrepreneurs the details of plans for increasing economic and
trade cooperation between China and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, managers of more than 100 large and medium-sized
enterprises from China's major provinces and municipalities, such
as Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin, are busy preparing to leave for
Latin America next week to tap what is considered by the Chinese
business sector as a "faraway but huge potential market".
</P>
<P>
These people constitute only a small part of an increasing
number of Chinese and Latin American teams promoting economic and
trade cooperation in both regions.
</P>
<P>
Yang Shidi, an official with China's Ministry of Foreign Trade
and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC), said that China and Latin
America complement each other in natural resources, technology and
market demand although they are separated by the enormous Pacific
Ocean.
</P>
<P>
"As the political relations between the two sides have improved
significantly and the exchange of visits by high-ranking officials
from both sides has become frequent over the past few years,
bilateral economic and trade cooperation has begun to experience
an upward trend," Yang added.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the MOFTEC show that trade between China and
Latin America surged to some 8.3 billion U.S. dollars in 1998 from
less than 2.3 billion U.S. dollars in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Experts predict that there will be an even higher growth for
bilateral trade as the Chinese government has listed Latin America
as a major trading partner with its diversified market strategy
since this year.
</P>
<P>
Official figures also indicate that China has established 246
enterprises in Latin America, with total investments of 335
million U.S. dollars, while Latin American businessmen have opened
more than 2,900 businesses in China, with combined capital of 8.3
billion U.S. dollars.

<TEXT>
<P>
Although the volume of trade and investment is relatively small,
there is great trade and economic cooperation potential between
the two sides since China is the world's biggest potential market
and Latin America is one of the regions that have the highest
degree of openness in the developing world, said Yu Xiaosong,
director of the China Council for the Promotion of International
Trade.
</P>
<P>
Yu pointed out that Latin America boasts rich natural resources,
such as copper, iron, oil and timber, which are all wanted in
China, whereas China-made electro-mechanical products, textiles,
clothing and many other goods are welcome in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
To turn the potential into actual advantages, Yu said, China
has taken steps to encourage its businesses to cooperate with
their Latin American counterparts in agricultural, textile, energy,
chemical and home appliances sectors.
</P>
<P>
China has also reached bilateral economic and trade cooperation
agreements with more than 10 Latin American countries, including
Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, and Peru.
</P>
<P>
Governments of Latin American countries and regional
organizations, such as the Latin American Economic System and the
Andean Community, have all acted to try to promote bilateral
economic and trade cooperation with China.
</P>
<P>
The Andean Community member states are very interested in the
huge market of over one billion people in China as well as China's
sophisticated technology for producing textiles, electro-
mechanical products and home appliances, said Allan Wagner,
international advisor of the Andean Community.
</P>
<P>
Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Peru and a number of other Latin
American countries have decided to conduct overall cooperation
with China in the areas of agriculture, energy, textiles, tourism,
telecommunications and transportation.
</P>
<P>
"Increasing cooperation between China, a country which has
registered the fastest growth in the world, and Latin America, the
second fastest growing region following Asia, will become a strong
driving force for mutual prosperity," said Jiang Shixue, vice
director of the Institute of Latin American Studies under the
Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.

Trouble started immediately after the session's beginning at
about 12.20 p.m. when AD Senate leader Mojisoluwa Akinfewa sought
through a motion to census PDP Senator Gbenga Aluko for allegedly
designating the image of some of his colleagues in a newspaper
pronouncement wherein he charged that AD and APP senators were
involved in bribery and corruption.
</P>
<P>
He urged the Senate to demand an unreserved apology to the
whole House as well as compel Senator Aluko to address a press
conference to retract the statement.
</P>
<P>
However, the PDP Senators respond by saying that the matter
though grave and serious, should not be allowed to stall the
screening of ministerial nominees.
</P>
<P>
A PDP Senator blamed in his speech the APP and AD Senators for
having abused the procedure by going to address the press first
before tabling the issue at the Senate. The motion was latter put
to a vote and the APP/ AD Senators were defeated, leading to the
walk-out protest of the two minority parties.
</P>
<P>
The marathon screening is expected to conclude Wednesday only
three days before the expiration of 21 days stipulated by the
constitution for the legislature to ratify or reject the nominees
list.

<HEADLINE> Winter-Spring Harvests Help Southern China's Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Farmers in China's island province
of Hainan are busy reaping the benefits of the fruit and
vegetables they grew this past winter and spring.
</P>
<P>
This year's harvest was good because of the good weather but it
has only been in recent years that they have really made money
from mainland markets where winter weather is harsh.
</P>
<P>
From winter to spring, the province produced 1.93 million tons
of fruits and vegetables, 1.27 million tons of which were sold
outside the province, earning 4.98 billion yuan and helping
increase farmers' per-capita incomes by 329 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Their per-capita income last year was 2,575 yuan, up 193 yuan
from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Farmers are becoming more aware of market-oriented strategies
and the provincial government has been trying to create a contract
system that will see to it that farmers have more stable incomes.
</P>
<P>
Hainan is trying to set up regular cooperative relations with
mainland provinces to provide them with fresh fruits and
vegetables every winter and spring and it held a winter fair with
the All China Federation of Co-ops last November, with a combined
transaction volume of over one million tons of food products.
</P>
<P>
Efficient distribution of fresh produce is important to farmers
' income and they have learned bitter lessons in the past that
good harvests did not necessarily mean good returns, so there are
some 2,300 purchasing centers now in the province.

<HEADLINE> Companies Flock to Jezzine for Rebuilding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Less than one month after the
pro-Israeli militia evacuated Lebanon's southern town of Jezzine,
public and private institutions flocked to the war-devastated town
for its reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
The state-run Council for Development and Reconstruction (CDR)
has conducted a survey of the damage in Jezzine and planned to
build three dams in the region, the Daily Star Wednesday quoted
South Lebanon's governor Faisal Sayegh as saying.
</P>
<P>
The CDR is currently working on a municipal building project
and is preparing to equip public hospitals in the town, the
governor said.
</P>
<P>
The Higher Relief Council and the Council for Development have
also begun works on rebuilding road, sewage and water networks.
</P>
<P>
The reconstruction efforts came in line with the orders of
Lebanese President Emile Lahoud and Prime Minister Salim Hoss when
they visited the area shortly after the liberation of Jezzine.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the South Lebanon Army (SLA) was forced to
leave Jezzine it had held since 1985 in the face of long-lasting
attacks by Lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
The move was widely seen as a prelude for an Israeli pullout
from south Lebanon where it set up a self-declared security zone
in 1985 to protect its north from cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
The 2,500-strong militia was armed and trained by Israel to
help it patrol the occupied border zone.
</P>
<P>
In addition to public institutions, private company also
joined the rehabilitation efforts, Sayegh said.

If the complaints about officials continue, their appointments
will be in question, according to Zhang Daozhu, a section chief of
the General Office of the Congress' Standing Committee, who
explains that the fairness of the panels' assessment can be
guaranteed by the hotline itself. The old method of monitoring
official behavior was basically to listen to work reports they
submitted to the Congress and to their superiors, and ordinary
people had little opportunity to participate in the appraisal
process.
</P>
<P>
 The new policy directly targets specific persons instead of
departments they are in charged of, and it gives greater rights to
the people, Zhang says.

<HEADLINE> Boom in Rare Birds in Northeast China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The numbers of rare birds has
been climbing continuously in northeast China's Liaoning province
in recent years as a growing number of migrating birds settle
there.
</P>
<P>
A total of 14 species of birds have chosen Liaoning as their
new habitat during their migrating course, increasing the total
bird species in the province to 382 at present.
</P>
<P>
"Most of the birds newly settled in Liaoning belong to rare and
endangered species," said a local ornithologist.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning is a major flight-path for migratory birds in east
China traveling to the north, and as many as 500,000 birds have
been found flying through the province in April and May every year.
</P>
<P>
"The settling of new birds in Liaoning indicates that the
ecological environment in the province is improving gradually,"
said the ornithologist.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the forest coverage rate is increasing at
an annual rate of two percent in this old heavy industrial base,
far above the national average. Meanwhile, pollution in major
rivers such as the Liaohe and Hunhe rivers is gradually dropping.
</P>
<P>
The policy of bird protection is regarded as another reason for
the increasing bird population. Liaoning started to prohibit
hunting in 1987, and has dealt with nearly 30,000 cases involving
infringing the rules since then.
</P>
<P>
"We aim to create a haven for birds in Liaoning," said Qiu
Yingjie, director of the provincial bureau for protecting wild
animals.

GUANGZHOU June 23 (Xinhua) -- Guangzhou, capital of south China
's prospering Guangdong Province, plans to prioritize software
development in a bid to promote the local information industry,
according to Vice-Mayor Lin Yuanhe.
</P>
<P>
Experts note that Guangzhou's software industry has set up a
solid foundation. Official statistics show the city's total 1998
output for software and integrated systems products hit 2.65
billion yuan (320 million US dollars). Guangzhou's software
industry has grown by an average annual rate of some 50 percent
over the past three years.
</P>
<P>
The Tianhe Science Park alone is home to 86 enterprises
specializing in the development of software and integrated systems
products, with six enterprises recording 1998 sales of over 100
million yuan each.
</P>
<P>
Efforts to network government departments on the Internet and
the high rate of personal computer ownership have created vast
potential for Guangzhou's software market.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show average of 30.8 personal computers for
every 100 Guangzhou families.
</P>
<P>
Guangzhou will focus achieving breakthroughs in its software
sector in order to accelerate growth of the information industry,
according to Lin.
</P>
<P>
Software has outstripped hardware in terms of total worldwide
output, with the former expected to 59 percent and the latter 41
percent of total output by the year 2001. And the respective
figures are expected to stand at 63 percent and 37 percent by 2005.

<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese province of Hebei
has called up 3 million people to prepare for possibly serious
flooding this summer.
</P>
<P>
As of last Friday, flood headquarters in the province are on 24-

<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican President Joaquim
Chissano has called on countries in the world to seriously
implement relevant U.N. resolutions on Angola and support the
efforts of the Angolan government in safeguarding peace, human
rights and democracy.
</P>
<P>
Chissano made the call Tuesday night at a banquet in honor of
visiting Botswanan President Festus Mogae, the Noticias newspaper
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that Jonas Savimbi, chairman of the opposition
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA),
should be responsible for sabotaging the 1994 Lusaka Peace
Protocol and other resolutions approved by the international
community, and for plunging Angola once again in a seemingly
endless civil war.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC),

ANKARA, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading Turkish newspapers Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Hurriyet (Freedom):
</P>
<P>
-- Turkish peacekeeping troops will leave for Kosovo on June 30
via Bulgaria and Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish troops are composed of 987 personnel scheduled to
be deployed in the sector allocated to the U.S. surveillance.
</P>
<P>
Radikal (Radical):
</P>
<P>
-- Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem has criticized the eight
industrialized countries, which have just concluded their summit
in Cologne, Germany, for their attempts to get involved in the
Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
Cem told reporters at Kayseri, central Anatolia of Turkey,
that the G-8 countries' call for the resumption of talks over the
Cyprus issue with no pre-conditions might cause trouble for
Turkey, the staunch supporter of the Turkish Cypriots who set up a
self-declared republic in northern Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Milliyet (National):
</P>
<P>
-- Turkish Cypriots have rejected a call made Sunday by the G-8
summit, which urged the resumption of talks over the Cyprus issue
in autumn with no pre-conditions.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots termed the call "an unacceptable
intervention on the Cyprus issue at a time when there is no common
ground between the Turkish Cypriots and Greek Cypriots on the
long-divided island."

<P>
KATHMANDU, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Taranath Ranabhat, co-general
secretary of the Nepali Congress, was elected unopposed Wednesday
speaker of the new House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
The 55-year-old speaker is a lawyer by training. He was an
advocate at the Supreme Court and a member of the Constitutional
Council, the Judicial Council and the Judicial Service Commission.
</P>
<P>
He also holds degrees in education and political science. He
served as headmaster of several schools.
</P>
<P>
He was elected to the house in the first general elections in
May 1991 after the multi-party parliamentary system was restored
in the country in 1990 and served as minister for law and justice
and parliamentary affairs for about seven months.
</P>
<P>
He lost in the mid-term polls in November 1994 but was returned
in the third general elections held in May this year. He was again
given the portfolio of minister for law and justice and
parliamentary affairs when the new government was formed on May
31.
</P>
<P>
He resigned Tuesday as minister to take up the post of speaker,
but he had publicly expressed his desire to serve as minister and
remain active in party politics. Press reports here said that he
also expressed his aversion to the post of speaker which requires
him to be neutral and restricts his political activities.
</P>
<P>
He was appointed general secretary of the Nepali Congress in
May 1996.
</P>
<P>
He was imprisoned for about five and a half years for being a
human rights activist and a party worker.

<HEADLINE> Philippines' Mayon Silent Again After Tuesday's Eruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' most active
volcano, Mayon, was silent again on Wednesday after it erupted on
Tuesday afternoon and rained ash on surrounding areas, causing no
casualties but forcing more than 400 families flee from their
homes.
</P>
<P>
Ed Laguerta, resident volcanologist of the Philippine Institute
of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs), said Wednesday that the
volcano's condition is "back to normal," but the "no man" rule
within the six to ten kilometers danger zone is strictly imposed
and Alert Level One is maintained.
</P>
<P>
Laguerta said the Tuesday blast was preatic in nature, devoid
of any physical sign to include sound and tremors.
</P>
<P>
But he said a preatic blast is less dangerous than a
strombolian eruption, Mt. Mayon's previous eruptive character.
</P>
<P>
According to Laguerta, a faint glow at the volcano's crater was
also observed Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
The volcano erupted at about 5 p.m. on Tuesday afternoon,
coughing a huge column of dark smoke and ash rising up several
hundreds of meters to the sky.
</P>
<P>
The ash-laden clouds stayed for about 45 minutes. A
giant-looming mushroom of fearsome smog drifted westward and
darkened the rather sunny afternoon in Albay Province in the
central Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Ash rained in three Albay towns and some 415 families numbering
to about a little less than 2,500 persons were evacuated from
previously identified danger zones to nearby schools.
</P>
<P>
But Albay Governor Al Francis Bichara, chairman of the
Provincial Disaster Coordinating Council, said they may order the
evacuees back to their abodes in two to three weeks if Mt. Mayon
continuously shows normal signs.
</P>
<P>
The Phivolcs said Tuesday that it has noted since May 13 the
activity of the Mayon volcano, which was characterized by
intermittent crater glow at the summit area and a slight increase
in sulfur dioxide emission.
</P>
<P>
Mayon, the most active volcano in the world, has erupted at
least 40 times since 1616. The volcano's last eruption on February
2, 1993, killed 78 people and affected 17,119 persons.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Confident of Resolving Y2K Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Government departments and
commercial enterprises in Shanghai, China's largest industrial and
commercial city, are confident they have generally solved the Y2K
problem, also known as the "millennium bug", since launching a
wide-ranging program to check most computers in September 1998.
</P>
<P>
Major public service organizations ranging from stock
exchanges, finance, taxation, posts and telecommunications to the
power, water and gas supply sectors are required to complete
computer re-programming work and finish Y2K testing before the end
of June.
</P>
<P>
The stock exchanges passed the tests in February and the local
banking system has also successfully conducted simulated ATM and
various points of sale transactions by rolling forward their
computer system's clocks to January 1, 2000. And government
taxation departments also report they have resolved the problem.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that, as scheduled, the remaining Y2K testing
work in Shanghai will be completed before 30 September and will be
evaluated shortly after to make sure all computers operate
normally on the stroke of midnight as the calendar turns to the
year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai is seen as one of China's cities which will be most
vulnerable to the Y2K problem because of its wide use of computers.
</P>
<P>
The Y2K bug stems from the failure of older computer systems to
distinguish between years with the same last two digits, such as
the years 2000 and 1900, which unless addressed has the potential
to create chaos in computer aided activities.

<P>
Ugandan and Rwandan delegates are to participate in a
ministerial meeting in Lusaka Wednesday to endorse the draft
report of the technical committee ahead of the planned summit.

<P>
Uganda has maintained a lot of military presence in eastern
Congo (K) to allegedly protect its border. Congolese President
Laurent Kabila has accused Kampala of backing the rebels to fight
his government.

<P>
In mid-April, Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni and Kabila
signed a cease-fire in Sirte, Libya. In May, Museveni ordered a
troop withdrawal from the southeastern part of Congo.

<HEADLINE> EDS-China-Locust Hordes Shandong Prepares to Battle Migratory Locust Hordes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, June 23 (Xinhua) -- East China's Shandong Province has
recently mobilized an army of 20,000 people supported by two
planes and many machines to fight locusts, known as the "East-Asia
Migratory Locust", which has wreaked havoc in the area since the
1960s.
</P>
<P>
Preparations for the battle include 850 tons of pesticides, 2,
000 machines, 200 tractors and many motorized vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Local authorities have set up a locust-control headquarters and
allocated 7 million yuan for the project, in addition to the 10
million yuan raised locally.
</P>
<P>
Shandong suffers from the worst ravages of migratory locusts
than any other province and region in the country. However, years
of effort has helped reduce the affected areas to 566,000 ha.
</P>
<P>
However, afflicted areas this year are 10 ha. more than usual
because of the joint effects of a long-lasting drought and a
relatively warm winter in 1998. These have created favorable
conditions for a huge surge in the population of locusts this year,
estimated to be much worse than last year.
</P>
<P>
The adult locusts fall on local crops in an eating frenzy, and
so far have devoured much of the local grassland and wheat, posing
a threat to the summer and even autumn harvests.

<HEADLINE> Cultural Relics from New Stone Age Unearthed in North China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIANZHUANG, June 23 (Xinhua) -- A number of cultural relics
have recently been unearthed in Huailai County, north China's
Hebei Province, during the second-stage construction of the
Beijing-Zhangjiakou Highway.
</P>
<P>
Archeologists said that most of the relics were over 6,000
years old from the New Stone Age, including bottles, pots with
handles, stone knives, and a Xun, an ancient egg-shaped, musical
instrument with holes similar to a flute.
</P>
<P>
And a delicately designed bronze mirror from the Spring and
Autumn Period (770 BC.- 476 BC.) and colorful drawings on pots
from the Han Dynasty (206 BC - 220 AD) can still be seen clearly,
which is quite unusual for items so old.
</P>
<P>
Archeologists said that the site used to be part of the Kingdom
of Yan in the Spring and Autumn Period. And the excavated relics
will be of great importance in the study of the political and
economic conditions, and customs at that time.

The foundation was established by Shapiro's relatives and
friends in London to help improve English language reporting in
China. Today's award ceremony is the fifth since the initiation of
the prize.
</P>
<P>
At the ceremony, prizes were also given to 16 teachers and
students at the China School of Journalism. So far, a total of 158
people have won the award.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Bans Food Imports from Four EU Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The Kenya Bureau of Standards
(KBS) Tuesday said it had banned the importation of food and soft
drinks from Luxembourg, France, Netherlands and Belgium with
immediate effect.
</P>
<P>
The ban follows the reports that some products from these
countries might find their way into the Kenyan market, and
eventually to consumers who might not be aware of the dangers
posed to their health, the state-run Kenya Times newspapers
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Several hundred people in the four EU countries fell ill after
consuming coca-cola beverages suspected to contain a fungicide
used to treat the wooden palettes on which they are transported,
the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Henry Mokaya, assistant director and head of quality assurance
division at the KBS told reporters that chicken, eggs, pork and
other related foods from the four countries had also been banned.
</P>
<P>
He said his bureau had alerted all major supermarkets in the
country of the risks involved in the importation of such foods.
</P>
<P>
"Through the East African Cooperation, we have alerted the
Tanzanian and Ugandan national bureaux of standards," he said,
adding that no contaminated coke had found its way into Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Mokaya also noted that his bureau had directed its surveillance
and warning teams to the individual firms importing coke in large
quantities.

<HEADLINE> China Makes Good Use of Foreign Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, June 23 (Xinhua) -- China has been granted loans
totaling 37 billion U.S. dollars from foreign sources to boost its
economic and social development in the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
The loans, provided by 22 countries and two international
financial organizations, have been used in more than 1,800
projects in the fields of infrastructure, transport,
telecommunications, environmental protection and farmland water
conservancy, according to Xia Zhihua, deputy head of the Treasury
Bonds and Financial Department under the Ministry of Finance.
</P>
<P>
"Most of these projects are operational, playing a big role in
China's economic growth," he added.
</P>
<P>
Since the Ministry of Finance worked out a series of
preferential measures to encourage a good flow of foreign loans to
the western part of China, more investment from overseas has
shifted from coastal areas to the country's mid and western part.
The majority of loans were used in building rural power grids and
windbreaks, irrigation networks, control of desert encroachment
and communications projects.

XI'AN, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The number of poverty-stricken
population in Qinling and Daba mountainous area, in northwest
China's Shaanxi Province, now stands at about half a million,
three quarters less than the figure five years ago.
</P>
<P>
Qinling and Daba area had 18 state-level and nine provincial-
level poor counties in 1994 with a total of 2.22 million people
living below the poverty line, accounting for a quarter of the
area's population.
</P>
<P>
Great efforts have been made to improve basic conditions for
agricultural production and spread the use of agro-technology over
the past five years and more. The increase on the acreage of
farmland and grain output have made it possible for local farmers
to have enough to eat, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
Special local economies, such as Shangluo's walnut and Hanzhong
's medicine, have won more shares in overseas and domestic market,
adding income for local farmers.
</P>
<P>
Local governments have also encouraged farmers to leave their
hometown to earn a living. More than 660,000 people in Sandi city
alone worked in other places last year.

JERUSALEM, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers on Wednesday.

<P>
The Jerusalem Post
</P>
<P>
-- Ariel Sharon, interim leader of the right-wing Likud Party,
intends to ask the party's central committee in the next few days
to consider joining the coalition government led by Prime
Minister-elect Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the negotiators of One Israel said the formation of

<HEADLINE> Citizens Being Encouraged to Evaluate Officials (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
Dalian, June 23 (Xinhua) -- It may seem strange to tell
people who are unhappy with a city official to just make a phone
call from their living rooms or a street booth to suggest that the
person be removed from office.
</P>
<P>
 But in fact this is just what is being tried out in northeast
China's coastal city of Dalian, where government officials' names
are published in newspapers and the citizens are encouraged to
keep an eye on them and discuss their performance over a phone on
a hotline.
</P>
<P>
 Some 300 people have called in since the line was opened last
month, according to Wu Hongyu, who operates the hotline at the
Standing Committee of the Dalian Municipal People's Congress, the
local legislature which drafts laws and appoints officials,
including the mayor.
</P>
<P>
 The People's Congress is China's basic political system. The
People's Congresses and their Standing Committees have been the
pivotal apparatus in supervision over and critical evaluation of
officials. Nowadays, new forms are being adopted in many places of
China to promote public participation in the evaluation of
officials, which is aimed at boosting transparency of government
work, promoting building of a clean government, and bolstering
efficiency.
</P>
<P>
Wu says that the first call came in after the names of the
heads of the labor, medical, and justice bureaus -- institutions
whose work most directly impacts on local residents' daily lives --
were made public, from a laid-off worker who refused to give his
name. He was unhappy with the head of the labor bureau because he
thought there were not enough policies to provide job
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
Other calls dealt with unemployment, malfeasance in
hospitals, and the law. And some ten people provided information
about suspected corruption cases, Wu says.
</P>
<P>
Wu believes that perhaps a few people are quite familiar
with the three heads, while others may have just got a glimpse of
them on TV. "But that doesn't matter," she concludes, "Everybody
can comment on their work just by feeling the pulse of the city's
daily life."
</P>
<P>
The Standing Committee of the Dalian Municipal People's
Congress established three 20-member panels of people's deputies,
officials, professors, and neighborhood committee members to deal
with the calls and to report on the officials' performance based
on people's opinions and further polls.

<HEADLINE> China Sets up Paleontology Research Station </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, June 23 (Xinhua) -- A paleontology research station
has recently been set up in Chengjiang County in southwestern
Yunnan Province for Chinese and overseas scientists to study the
well-known "Chengjiang animal fossils".
</P>
<P>
The station, located on the top of the Maotian Mountain, the
original place of discovery, is affiliated with the Nanjing
Institute of Geology and Paleontology under the Chinese Academy of
Sciences in east China's Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
The building was designed by Qi Kang, a noted Chinese architect,
and furnished with advanced equipment and facilities.
</P>
<P>
The inauguration ceremony was attended by Lu Yongxiang,
president of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Chen Junyuan, a
professor with the Nanjing institute and Li C.-W., a professor
with the National Tsinghua University of Taiwan, as well as 30
other prestigious paleontologists from around the world.
</P>
<P>
The discovery of these fossils in 1984 was hailed as one of the
most amazing geological discoveries of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
They are believed to be examples of the earliest multi-cellular
animals living on Earth and are more than 20 million years older
than the Ediacaran biota found in Australia which had been
regarded as the earliest such animal.
</P>
<P>
The discovery could lead to significant breakthroughs in
exploring the evolution of early life on the globe, experts say.

<HEADLINE> Parents of 1 in 4 Children in New Zealand Jobless </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Almost one in four children in
New Zealand have no parent in paid work, Statistics New Zealand
said.
</P>
<P>
In a report, which was made public here Wednesday, the NZ
government statistical organ said that more than 40 percent of
Maori children come from homes where parents are unemployed. By
comparison, 13.8 percent of European children have no parent in
paid work.
</P>
<P>
The proportion of children without a parent in paid work had
increased from 14 percent 13 years ago to 23 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand's deputy government statistician Dianne Macaskill
said the report, based on information from the 1996 census, showed
there were 832,100 children under 15 in New Zealand. Three out of
five (62.4 percent) were European, a quarter (24.5 percent) were
Maori, and the remaining 13.1 percent were from other ethnic
groups.
</P>
<P>
Other findings indicated that the proportion of children in
sole-parent families had increased to 23.6 percent in 1996 from
21.6 percent in 1991.

<P>
JERUSALEM, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The number of unemployed people
in Israel crossed the 200,000 line in April for the first time in
six years, the Haaretz daily reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
After standing at a steady 8.6 percent in the first three
months, the jobless rate rose to 8.7 percent of the
2.3-million-plus work force in April, indicating that 201,600
people were unemployed.
</P>
<P>
The jobless rate hovered between 8.3 percent and 8.6 percent
throughout 1998.
</P>
<P>
Economic officials believe that unemployment will continue to
rise in the months ahead. Last week, the Employment Service
reported a sharp rise in the number of job seekers in May, which
reached 164,000.
</P>
<P>
Generally speaking, job seekers represent about 80 percent of
the unemployed. This means that the number of the jobless in May
might total at 205,000, according to the business newspaper
Globes.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Minister Calls for Family Planning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan Minister of Finance,
Planning and Economic Development Gerald Ssendaula has called for
effective family planning to control the high population growth
rate in the country.
</P>
<P>
He made the call when receiving 12 motor vehicles donated by
the United Nations Fund for Population Activities here Tuesday,
the New Vision daily reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The finance minister recommended four children per family,
saying the economy of Ugandan cannot sustain a very large
population resulting from big families.
</P>
<P>
Families should not produce to the extent of nine children
because the economy cannot sustain them effectively, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Uganda's population growth rate is about four percent. Large
families and many dependents are often cited by local people as
significant obstacles to rising out of poverty. This is
highlighted by the country's high dependency ratio.
</P>
<P>
The 1997 National Household Survey established this ratio to be
55.7 percent in rural areas, 47.2 percent for urban areas.
</P>
<P>
The high number of dependents leads to a dilution in the meagre
 resources available, hence under-nutrition and lack of cash for
accessing services and basic necessities.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Hai'er, China's leading domestic
appliance producer, has stamped its mark on the Philippines, the
China Economic Times reports.
</P>
<P>
Hai'er refrigerators now have a 60 percent share of sales in
the biggest super market chain in the Philippines, and its sales
network spans large and middle sized cities across the country,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
The company set up a joint-venture in the Philippines in late
1997, when other multinational home appliance producers withdrew
to escape from the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
After careful market survey into the Philippine market, Hai'er
decided to invest in refrigerator manufacturing there.
</P>
<P>
The joint-venture managed to cut costs by localizing the design
and components purchase, and developing the market with
advertising as well as an efficient service and after-sales
network.
</P>
<P>
Actual production last year was 30 percent above the original
plan and halfway through this year, the company has so far made as
many refrigerators as in the whole of last year.
</P>
<P>
When other multinational companies returned to the Philippines
this year with the recovery of local economy, they found Hai'er
advertising billboards spread across the country.

HONG KONG, June 23 (Xinhua) -- A record 82 exhibitors from
major film producing countries and regions around the world are
displaying their latest productions at the Hong Kong International
Film and TV Market (FILMART), which opened Wednesday and will last
to Friday.
</P>
<P>
Apart from local ones, there are exhibitors from Australia,
Britain, Canada, China's mainland, Italy, Taiwan and the United
States.
</P>
<P>
This year's FILMART is more international than ever, said the
Hong Kong Trade Development Council (TDC), the organizer of the
market.
</P>
<P>
The Italian Cinema Promotion Agency is taking part in the event
for the first time to promote Italy's world-famous movies. And,
besides, Japan has organized a first-time mission to attend the
event, the TDC said.
</P>
<P>
To aid the development of the local film and TV industry in the
medium-to-long term, this year's FILMART is launching a concrete
initiative -- Forum 1999, which comprises a series of discussions
and workshops, that seeks to obtain new ideas for revitalizing and
sustaining Hong Kong and Asian film-making.
</P>
<P>
This is the third year that the TDC has staged FILMART.
Addressing the opening ceremony, Acting TDC Executive Director
Anna Lai said TV has been added to the original name of Hong Kong
International Film Market this year.
</P>

The change and expansion of the name indicate that the event
itself has developed and grown.
</P>
<P>
To meet the industry's needs, a series of seminars with focus
on distribution and co-production is being held during the fair
period. Key industry players from Japan will share their
experience in co-production with Hong Kong companies. There are
also workshops on the outlook of film and TV markets in Germany,
Italy, South Korea and Russia.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is one of the largest film production centers in the
world and ranks first in film production on a per-capita basis.

<HEADLINE> Tibetans In Southwest China Having Fewer Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous
Prefecture in China's Sichuan Province has given 822 households
certificates for one-child couples.
</P>
<P>
The family planning concept of local people has been changing
with the rapid economic development, according to Zhou Licheng,
the deputy director of the provincial Religious Affairs Commission.
</P>
<P>
Tibetans in the prefecture in western Sichuan were allowed to
have two children in the family planning regulations but more now
prefer to have one child, and herdsmen, who were allowed to have
three children, now want only two. Tibetans in the prefecture were
allowed to have two or three children at the beginning of the one-
couple-one-child policy in the early 1970s because the birth rate
was relatively low.
</P>
<P>
In line with the changing family planning concept, the Standing
Committee of the prefectural People's Congress recently submitted
a bill to the Standing Committee of the provincial People's
Congress, asking that the local family planning policy be revised
because of social changes.
</P>
<P>
Before new China was founded, the average life expectancy of
people in the prefecture was only 29. Then the figure rose to 55
in the early 1980s and the prefecture's population has increased
from 480,000 to 870,000 in five decades. The purpose of the
revisions in the regulations is to encourage new birth control
concepts and help families become richer first.
</P>
<P>
The revised regulations provides preferential treatment for one-
child families in various aspects, including school enrollment,
medical care, and employment.

<P>
KUNMING, June 23 (Xinhua) -- China, which has over 32,000 types
of plants, is the "mother of the world's gardens," a British
botanist has said recently.
</P>
<P>
David Paterson, director of the British Royal Botanic Garden in
Edinburgh, said at the '99 Kunming World Horticulture Exposition
in Yunnan Province that China ranks the first in the northern
hemisphere in plant species.
</P>
<P>
And, the 300-year-old British garden and botanic research
institute has the richest Chinese plant species collection outside
China, he said. More than 90 percent of the plants on display at
the British exhibition hall in Kunming are Chinese plants
cultivated in a traditional British way, he added.
</P>
<P>
Paterson said that as early as the 17th and 18th centuries,
botanists from Europe visited China frequently and brought back
many plant species that can now be found in many European gardens
and, whether past or present, China's horticulture has had a
profound influence on European gardens.

<P>
HONG KONG, June 23 (Xinhua) -- A record 82 exhibitors from
major film producing countries and regions around the world are
displaying their latest productions at the Hong Kong International
Film and TV Market (FILMART), which opened Wednesday and will last
to Friday.
</P>
<P>
Apart from local ones, there are exhibitors from Australia,
Britain, Canada, China's mainland, Italy, Taiwan and the United
States.
</P>
<P>
This year's FILMART is more international than ever, said the
Hong Kong Trade Development Council (TDC), the organizer of the
market.
</P>
<P>
The Italian Cinema Promotion Agency is taking part in the event
for the first time to promote Italy's world-famous movies, and,
besides, Japan has organized a first-time mission to attend the
event, the TDC said.
</P>
<P>
To aid the development of the local film and TV industry in the
medium-to-long term, this year's FILMART is launching a concrete
initiative -- Forum 1999, which comprises a series of discussions
and workshops, that seeks to obtain new ideas for revitalizing and
sustaining Hong Kong and Asian film-making.
</P>
<P>
This is the third year that the TDC has staged FILMART.
Addressing the opening ceremony, Acting TDC Executive Director
Anna Lai said TV has been added to the original name of Hong Kong
International Film Market this year.
</P>
<P>
The change and expansion of the name indicate that the event
itself has developed and grown.
</P>
<P>
To meet the industry's needs, a series of seminars with focus
on distribution and co-production is being held during the fair
period. Key industry players from Japan will share their
experience in co-production with Hong Kong companies. There are
also workshops on the outlook of film and TV markets in Germany,
Italy, South Korea and Russia.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is one of the largest film production centers in the
world and ranks first in film production on a per capita basis.
Hong Kong is also a major exporter of television programs.

<P>
JAKARTA, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Four Indonesian taekwondo athletes
-- two women and two men -- are set to leave for Croatia to take
part in the pre-Olympics qualifying championship to be held on
July 8 to 11, the Indonesian Observer reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The men athletes are flyweight Satrio Rahadani and
featherweight Dominggus Borrow while their women compatriots are
flyweight Juana Wangsa Putri and featherweight Veronica.
</P>
<P>
Contenders must reach the top four places to qualify for Sydney
Olympics next year.
</P>
<P>
"I hope one of them can get through," said Zarkasih Ahmad,
secretary-general of the country's taekwondo governing body.
</P>
<P>
If they fail in Croatia, they still have some hope of getting
through provided they can reach the finals round of the regional
tournament to be held in the Philippines on September 26-27.
</P>
<P>
When asked which team member has the best chance, Zarkasih
mentioned two of his prodigies but asked not to reveal their names
for fear that it would result in a psychological burden for the
team.
</P>
<P>
He said the two fared better than the others during the World
Championship in Edmonton, Canada, early this June, and both
reached the third round.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Faces Food Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe faces a serious food
crisis following the decision Tuesday by the country's largest
milling companies to stop milling maize meal, a staple food for
the majority of the country's 12.5 million people.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held in Harare, Blue Ribbon Foods
managing director Misheck Nyamungidza said his company had ceased
milling maize with effect from Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
National Foods managing director Ian Kind said in a letter that
his company ended milling maize Tuesday because it was no longer
sustainable to operate given the Grain Marketing Board (GMB) maize
prices.
</P>
<P>
The government through the GMB increased the price of maize
this year by 63 percent.
</P>
<P>
Millers were only allowed to adjust their prices by 20 percent
instead of 61.2 percent they demanded.
</P>
<P>
Midlands Milling Company and Victoria Milling Company were also
said to be going to halt their maize milling operations.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe is said to have a maize shortfall of between 300,000
and 600, 000 tons of maize this season.
</P>
<P>
"Zimbabwe is shifting from being a net food exporter to being a
net food importer. This will affect the average man on the street
seriously," one miller said.
</P>
<P>
The National Bakers Association (NBA) said Tuesday its members
will close down their operations once the government gazette on
the price of bread is out.
</P>
<P>
NBA chairman Eddie Cross told the Zimbabwe News Agency Ziana
Tuesday that bakers would be forced to stop production of bread as
soon as the new regulations were promulgated.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Aims at Least 70 Golds in SEA Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The National Sports Council (KONI)
official in charge of athletes development Mochmad Hindarto said
Indonesia will need at least 70 golds to retain the overall title
at the Southeast Asian (SEA) Games in Brunei Darussalam in August.
</P>
<P>
Hindarto warned that Indonesia would face a tough challenge
from arch-rival Thailand, especially in athletics, swimming and
shooting.
</P>
<P>
"If we want to retain the title we won here two years ago, we
must win at least 70 of 235 golds at stake. Thailand, based on our
observations in the 13th Asian Games last year, has shown great
improvement in their second stringers. It will threaten our goal
if we fail in our prospective winning events," he was quoted by
the Jakarta Post Wednesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
In track and field, the Indonesian Amateur Athletics
Association has set a target of six of 41 golds on offer. Hopes
for first-place finishes are in the women's 1,500 meters, 5,000
meters and 10,000 meters, women's 100 meters and 200 meters and
men's pole vaults.
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, Malaysia dominated the track by grabbing 16
golds, followed by Thailand with 15 and Indonesia with eight.
</P>
<P>
In the pool, Indonesia will likely scoop only five of 37 golds.
Women swimmers Rita Mariani and Catherine Surya are considered
unlikely to compete in the biennial event, which will take place
from August 7 to 15.
</P>
<P>
From shooting, Indonesia hopes to win two of 12 golds from the
women's individual and team skeet shooting. Two years ago,
Indonesia won 11 of 22 golds.
</P>
<P>
Separately, Indonesian Rowing and Canoeing Association
secretary-general Budiman Setiawan declined to mention the
organization's target but said Myanmar would be the toughest
opponent.
</P>
<P>
Budiman admitted that 50 Indonesian traditional boat racers,
who are in training for the Games, have yet to reach their
required physical condition due to the late training program.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian Taekwondo Association secretary-general Ahmad
Zarkasih Hamid said the organization hired a coach from the marine
Sukarji to improve the competitiveness of its seven women and
eight men athletes.
</P>
<P>
"Our athletes always have problems with their killer instinct
before fighting. Hopefully, our new measure will help them
overcome their mental barrier," he said.
</P>
<P>
He named the Vietnamese and Filipinos as tough rivals.

LANZHOU, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The Academy of Dunhuang Arts was
opened recently at Northwest China Teachers University in Lanzhou,
the capital of Gansu Province as China's first academy for the
study of the art.
</P>
<P>
The art objects of Dunhuang came to light in 1900 when a Taoist

art in one of the 492 caves at Dunhuang at the Mogao Grottoes in
the western part of the province. Since then, thousands of Chinese
and foreign scholars have come to study these unique stone
sculptures.
</P>
<P>
Wang Limin, the deputy head of Northwest China Teachers
University, became the first president of the academy, which will
provide an area for the study of Dunhuang culture, the training of
specialists, and the promotion of exchanges abroad.
</P>
<P>
Li Chengxian, wife of Chang Shuhong, a painter who advocated
the establishment of just such an academy but died in 1994,
presented some of Chang's paintings to the academy. Chang Shuhong'
s son Chang Jiahuang, a famous Dunhuang scholar, was named
director of Chang Shuhong's arts research office, which is part of

<P>
DHAKA, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's foreign debt, which
stands at 14.033 billion U.S. dollars on June 30, 1999, has been
declining over the past few years, The New Nation newspaper

The country's highest foreign debt of 16.767 billion dollars
was registered on June 30, 1995, which was brought down to 15.166
billion dollars in June 1996 and 15.025 billion dollars in June

</P>
<P>
The figures do not include food, aviation fuel and short-term
loan taken from the International Monetary Fund, the report said.

<P>
The country repaid a total loan of 5.643 billion dollars since
the 1971-72 fiscal year, of which 3.573 billion dollars was
against principal and 2.072 billion dollars against interest. In
the 1997-98 fiscal year ending on June 30, 1998, 5.9 percent of

<HEADLINE> Thai Military Bank to Seek Government Help </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Thai Military Bank will seek up to
15 billion baht (405.4 million U.S. dollars) in state assistance
to raise capital funds, the Bangkok Post reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The bank will be the second commercial bank to request help
under the government assistance program, whereby new preferred
shares are bought by the Finance Ministry using 10-year government
bonds.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Siam Commercial Bank raised almost 65
billion baht (1.76 billion dollars) through a rights issue to
shareholders, a new placement to foreign investors and the
government program.
</P>
<P>
Under the government program, state capital is provided to
match funds raised from new or existing shareholders.
</P>
<P>
Applicants must also set aside full provisions against loan
losses. If existing provisions are insufficient, shareholders'
equity could be written down to make up the difference.
</P>
<P>
Local financial institutions must set aside 40 percent of their
provisioning requirements by the end of the month and 60 percent
by year-end.
</P>
<P>
Thai Military Bank executives were quoted by the newspaper as
saying no writedown was necessary for the bank as existing funds
were sufficient. Current management would also remain unchanged.
</P>
<P>
They said the bank needs 10 billion to 12 billion baht (270
million to 324 million dollars) in new capital to fully meet
provisioning requirements and is expected to complete
recapitalization by year-end.
</P>
<P>
Thai Military Bank is the country's sixth largest commercial
bank in terms of assets. It reported a loss of 871.7 million baht
(23.6 million dollars) in the first quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
As the major shareholder of the bank, the Thai Armed Forces
said they were not concerned about diluting their stake, the
Bangkok Post said.

<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Singapore has been invited to
take part in the Financial Stability Forum (FSF), a body
established in February by the Group of Seven ministers to guard
against further financial crises, the Monetary Authorities of
Singapore (MAS) announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"MAS looks forward to participating fully and contributing
actively to this international effort to foster a more stable
financial system globally," Koh Yong Guan, managing director of
the MAS, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The forum, which groups the world's leading financial market
players, also invited China's Hong Kong, Australia and the
Netherlands to join the broadened FSF, following a decision made
by the G7 over the weekend to include more major financial
markets.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from the four new members will attend the next
FSF meeting in Paris on September 15.
</P>
<P>
In the FSF, which was created under the proposition of
Germany's Bundesbank President Hans Tietmeyer this February, top
regulators from the world's major financial markets share
information on preventing further global financial crises.
</P>
<P>
Tietmeyer said then that since it was possible to have a world
authority to regulate the global financial system, "the only way
is to get existing organizations to work together better and more
regularly."

<HEADLINE> Women-owned Businesses in U.S. Top 9 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Women-owned businesses in the
United States have more than doubled over the past 12 years,
according to a report released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Nowadays, there are 9.1 million such businesses, accounting for
38 percent of all businesses in the country, said the National
Association of Women Business Owners (NAWBO), an organization
representing the interests of the country's women entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
The women-owned businesses contributed over 3.6 trillion U.S.
dollars in revenues last year to the U.S. economy, and employment
in these firms has quadrupled since 1987. In 1995, they provided
jobs for over 18.5 million people.
</P>
<P>
A NAWBO membership survey conducted last year revealed that one
in eight of their businesses were involved in international trade,
and 28 percent of them expected to be involved in the global
marketplace. Nearly half of them sell their products or provide
services to large corporations.
</P>
<P>
Maintaining or achieving business profitability and growth was
the top issue for NAWBO members, followed by keeping up with
technology, finding and keeping quality employees, expanding into
new markets and cost of providing employee benefits, according to
last year's survey.
</P>
<P>
Women entrepreneurs in the United States take the lead in
embracing technology. According to last year's survey, 98 percent
of the NAWBO members used computers, and one-third of their
businesses had a local area network (LAN). More than half of them
were regular Internet users and 43 percent of them had a homepage
for their business on the World Wide Web.

<HEADLINE> Central Government Funds Repairs of Tibet's Sagya Temple </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, June 23 (Xinhua) -- China's Cultural Heritage
Administration and the Tibet Autonomous Region recently decided to
renovate the Sagya Temple, one of Tibet's major Buddhist temples,
450 kilometers west of the capital Lhasa.
</P>
<P>
It was built in 1073 and has long been almost as famous as the
Dunhuang Grottoes in Gansu Province for its large collection of
Buddhist scriptures, porcelains, and wall paintings dating back
nearly a thousand years. It has been under state protection since
1961.
</P>
<P>
Cultural Heritage Administration people who visited the temple
recently said that it is one of the major Buddhist temples in
Tibet and provides historical evidence of China's unification.
According to historians, Tibet officially came under the control
of the Chinese government as a region or province in the mid-13th
century at the beginning of the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1386).
</P>
<P>
Historical documents show that in 1264, Kublai Khan, who
founded the Yuan, unified Tibet and granted 13 'hri-skors' (
administrative units of 10,000 households each) in Tibet to
Phagsba, the Sakypa Dagchhen (head of the Sagya Sect), as a
tribute. Phagsba was then named King of Tibet by Kublai Khan.
</P>
<P>
The temple was used for religious activities and an
administrative office and was at one time the political, economic,
and cultural center of Tibet. It was built in the style of a Yuan
Dynasty castle, with stone walls 10 meters high with dozens of
small blockhouses along them and a large watchtower at each of the
four corners.
</P>
<P>
The temple buildings are red, white, and black, symbolizing
three Buddhist deities, with an interesting mixture of Han,
Mongolian and Tibetan styles. It has an incredible collection of
unique Buddhist scriptures printed on parchment made of Bodhi-tree
leaves. There is also a large collection of historical relics,
imperial edicts, imperial court manuscripts, and a variety of
utensils for temple use. Certificates and seals from the Yuan
Dynasty are still kept there and were on display in Beijing at a
nine-day Tibetan Culture Exhibition in March.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese central government has allocated special funds to
renovate the temple twice since the liberation of Tibet in 1951
and a group will be established to be responsible for this
renovation project.

<HEADLINE> Thai Cabinet Approves to Peg Salary Rise at 5 PC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The Thai cabinet has approved a
proposal by the Budget Bureau to maintain a 5-percent ceiling on
pay rises in the public sector for the second consecutive year,
said a Government House press release available Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The ceiling for salary increments at each state agency in
fiscal 2000, which starts in September, will be set at 5 percent
of the combined amount to be paid to officials on July 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The biggest proportion of salary increments will go to low- and
middle-ranking officials to keep as minimal as possible the effect
of spending cuts on them, the release said.
</P>
<P>
In the year 2001, senior officials will get only one-step
promotion, except those with "an outstanding achievement," who can
get a one-and-half-step pay rise.
</P>
<P>
Outstanding officials usually get a two-step increase in the
past.
</P>
<P>
A cabinet resolution dated September 24, 1996, authorizing
remittances from the central fund for pay rises for
specially-rewarded officials, will be put on hold for a year in
order to avoid discrimination and injustice among working
officials.
</P>
<P>
These specially-rewarded officials will, however, receive their
pay rise from the normal budget and the limit will not exceed 5
percent.
</P>
<P>
In addition, last year's ban on creation of new units or the
expansion of existing ones will continue until 2001, in line with
a government policy to increase efficiency while seeking to keep
the bureaucracy small and compact.
</P>
<P>
All state enterprises are ordered to adopt the same measures as
that of government agencies in the fiscal budget 2001.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Provides Loan for Chinese Irrigation Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The government of Kuwait signed a
contract to provide 33 million U.S. dollars in a second loan for a
major irrigation project in China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region,
recently.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait has provided China with 500 million U.S. dollars worth
of loans since 1984, one of the largest amounts of foreign loans
provided to China.
</P>
<P>
The second group of loan will be used for seven pumping
stations and 13 irrigation projects. Abdulwahab Al-Bader, vice
president of Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development, says the
fund is satisfied with the way the 33 million dollars were used
during the first phase.
</P>
<P>
The project is designed to open up 133,300 hectares of
wasteland along the Yellow River by using river water. More than a
million poverty-stricken people living in the southern part of
Ningxia will settle in the new area.
</P>
<P>
Since the project started in 1995, the region has built three
pump stations and a 23-k.m. trunk canal that will help irrigate 18,
000 hectares of land. Some 1,630 households, with 8,700 people, in
southern Ningxia have moved to the new irrigated area.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam to Implement New Policy for Foreign Investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam is making great efforts to
attract more foreign direct investment by implementing a
single-price policy for foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam attracted 1.9 billion U.S. dollars of foreign
investment in 1998. The number of projects and the amount of
foreign investment in Vietnam in 1998 decreased 21.5 and 10.1
percent over 1997 respectively because of the negative impacts of
the regional financial and monetary crisis on the country.
</P>
<P>
Vietnamese Prime Minister Phan Van Khai has signed Decision 53,
aiming to promote foreign direct investment in the country,
according to the local press.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's dual-pricing policy that discriminates against
foreign investors will be gradually lifted and they will benefit
from privileges relating to land lease price, salary payment in
the Vietnamese dong and other measures.
</P>
<P>
Beginning on July 1, the application fee for foreign direct
investment licenses will be abolished and telephone and fax
machine installation charges for foreigners will be the same as
for the Vietnamese. Electric power prices for foreigners will be
based on the local currency. The fee for a foreign representative
office license will fall from 5,000 dollars to 1 million
Vietnamese dong (about 71.9 dollars).
</P>
<P>
Also beginning on July 1, unskilled workers working for foreign
businesses in inner districts of Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City will
enjoy a minimum salary of 626,000 Vietnamese dong (about 45
dollars) and 556,000 Vietnamese dong (about 40 dollars) if the
businesses are located in suburban districts of the two cities or
in all districts of Hai Phong, Bien Hoa and Vung Tau cities. A
minimum salary of 487,000 Vietnamese dong (about 35 dollars)
applies to all other foreign-invested businesses in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's Deputy Minister of Planning and Investment Nguyen
Nhac said the measures would directly reduce investment costs to
improve competitiveness of businesses and further simplify
procedures and solve the difficulties of foreign investors.

<HEADLINE> S. Lankan Rebels Keen on South Africa as Facilitator </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's Liberation Tigers of
Tamil Eelam (LTTE) rebels are keen on soliciting the service of
South Africa as third-party facilitator if and when peace talks
with the government are held, informed sources said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE's political advisor Anton Balasingham, now residing in
London, is expected to initiate moves to engage South Africa as
facilitator, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE has sent congratulatory messages to new South African
President Thabo Mbeki upon his being elected.
</P>
<P>
Balasingham is due to visit South Africa in the near future to
push for South African facilitation, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
In addition to meeting President Mbeki, Balasingham is also
likely to request former President Nelson Mandela's involvement.
</P>
<P>
Mandela had said earlier that he was willing to play a
mediating role in Sri Lankan peace negotiations if asked to do so.
</P>
<P>
A sizable section of South African parliamentarians, officials
and African National Congress activists are promoting mediatory
efforts.
</P>
<P>
However, it is not clear at present whether South Africa would
be prepared to act as third party facilitator or whether the
retired Mandela is prepared to be involved personally.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels have been fighting a war for an independent
Tamil homeland in Sri Lanka's north and east since 1983.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Golkar Overtakes Awakening Party in Votes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's ruling Golkar Party
has overtaken the National Awakening Party (PKB) as runner-up in
the provisional results of the June 7 polls based on the latest
vote tally by the General Election Commission (KPU) as of
Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
The official tally by the KPU has so far tabulated about 50
percent of the votes outstanding. Provisional tallies show that
the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P) still
maintains its commanding lead while Golkar overtook PKB which had
held second place since the first day of counting.
</P>
<P>
The PDI-P has obtained 21.94 million votes, followed by Golkar
11 million and PKB 10.84 million.
</P>
<P>
Trailing in fourth place was the United Development Party (PPP)
with 5.9 million votes, followed by the National Mandate Party
(PAN) 4 million votes, the Crescent Start Party (PBB) 958,571
votes and the Justice Party (PK) 724,981 votes.
</P>
<P>
As no single party is expected to win the majority of votes in
this election, horse-trading and coalition building are high on
the country's political agenda.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Golkar Party said it may review the nomination of
the incumbent President B.J. Habibie.
</P>
<P>
"If (our) approaches to other political parties do not produce
positive results, then Golkar will reevaluate the name of its
presidential candidate. Until now, we still maintain the
nomination of President Habibie as our sole candidate, because it
was agreed to at our executives meeting," party Chairman Akbar
Tanjung said.
</P>
<P>
Akbar said the ruling party will also review its nomination for
the vice president.
</P>
<P>
"If the nomination fails to get support from other political
parties, we will reevaluate it and open the position to others,"
he was quoted by The Indonesian Observer Wednesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
KPU Chairman Rudini Tuesday reaffirmed that the vote count at
the national level would be completed on the originally scheduled
date despite a delay in its start.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian Election Committee (PPI) was originally
scheduled to begin the vote count at the national level on June 21
and conclude it on July 6 while on July 8, KPU would announce the
final results of the vote count.
</P>
<P>
But the start of count was postponed because KPU members on
Monday requested that all election violations be settled first.
</P>
<P>
Pressed for time, KPU agreed on Tuesday to begin the national
ballot count before the final poll results came in from all the 27
provinces.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Northern Ireland Peace Accord May Collapse: Blair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 23 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
has said that the Northern Ireland's peace accord could collapse
as it is approaching the June 30 deadline for ending a deadlock
over decommissioning.
</P>
<P>
Blair delivered a take-it-or-leave-it warning on Tuesday night
to feuding Northern Ireland politicians, making clear on Northern
Ireland television that he was fed up with a long-running dispute
between Protestant and Roman Catholic leaders over guerrilla
disarmament which has paralyzed the province's peace process.
</P>
<P>
"If this agreement goes down, then we will have to pick up the
pieces in the best way we can," Blair said, "We have gone on
talking and talking and talking. At some point people have got to
make up their minds. I have got no great Plan B in my pocket."
</P>
<P>
In an article in the Times newspaper on Wednesday, Gerry Adams,
president of the Irish Republican Army's political wing Sinn Fein,
said the present state of political limbo was untenable.
</P>
<P>
"There is a very real danger that events on the ground could
spiral out of control," Adams said.
</P>
<P>
Mainstream guerrilla groups have been observing truces in
Northern Ireland, but the Good Friday accord has failed to stop
sporadic violence or heal sectarian divisions between the majority
Protestants and minority Catholics.
</P>
<P>
With tension rising in Northern Ireland, the British army
announced on Tuesday that 1,300 troops who had been withdrawn from
the province would return in time for the often troubled
Protestant "marching season," according to local media reports.
</P>
<P>
David Trimble, leader of the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP), the
main Protestant party, indicated on Tuesday he would like Blair to
sack Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam.
</P>
<P>
"One of the great difficulties we have had in implementing the
Good Friday agreement has been the widespread lack of confidence
in the community with regard to what the Secretary of State does,"
Trimble was quoted by the London Evening Standard as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, Blair dismissed Trimble's criticism of Mowlam, saying,
"I think Secretaries of State for Northern Ireland get used to
being attacked by virtually everyone."
</P>
<P>
Blair and Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern are expected to
arrive in Belfast later this week on a mission to rescue the Good
Friday agreement.

<P>
BUENOS AIRES, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Argentina has requested the

<HEADLINE> U.N. Ship Arrives in E. Timor With Ballot Equipment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. ship "Artic Atlantik"
arrived in Dili, capital of East Timor, on Tuesday with equipment
for the August 8 direct ballot, according to reports reaching here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. ship arrived from Darwin, Australia, with a number of
computer sets, photocopy machines and some generators, U.N.
Assessment Mission in East Timor (UNAMET) spokesman David Wimhurst
said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a Russian-made IL-76 cargo plane also arrived at the
airport of Baucau District on Monday from Singapore, carrying 39
car units for the same purposes.
</P>
<P>
In addition to land transportation means, UNAMET has so far
been furnished with three Super Puma SA-332-SL helicopters and
will in the near future receive another three medium-sized
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
The means of transportation and office supplies as well as
computer facilities would be installed in each district where the
UNAMET representative office is located.
</P>
<P>
Wimhurst admitted that UNAMET has been slow in making
preparations for the August 8 ballot but this is because the U.N.
personnel are not coming to East Timor simultaneously and because
construction of infrastructure facilities has yet to be completed.
</P>
<P>
However, UNAMET is determined to work hard and if possible
would recruit local personnel to assist it in all areas of East
Timor, Wimhurst was quoted by Antara News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement signed by Indonesia and Portugal on May 5,
the United Nations will deploy civilian police advisers from
several countries to assist Indonesian police in maintaining law
and order. A key function will be the disarmament of rival
factions that are either for or against independence.
</P>
<P>
The August 8 ballot will allow the territory's people to decide
whether their homeland should become an autonomous region within
Indonesia or totally independent. The Indonesian government has
announced that it would grant East Timor independence if the
people there reject Indonesia's offer of wide-ranging autonomy.
</P>
<P>
The former Portuguese colony of East Timor was integrated into
Indonesia in 1976 in a move never recognized by the United
Nations, which still considers Portugal as the administering power
of the territory.

<HEADLINE> Illegal Oil Refineries to Be Shut down by July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Measures will be taken to
guarantee that all unauthorized oil refineries and oil refining
equipment be banned before the end of July, according to today's
China Daily.
</P>
<P>
China's four administrative bodies, namely the Ministry of
Public Security, the State Petrochemical Industry Bureau, the
State Environmental Protection Administration and the State
Industry and Commerce Administrative Bureau, issued a joint
announcement recently, calling for enhanced efforts to bring to a
halt the illegal operations of small oil refineries.
</P>
<P>
As those small oil refineries treat oil with inadequate
equipment and without scientific procedures, they often pose
safety threat to their workers, the statement says.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, they sell their products at prices much lower than
regular oil refineries due to their unreasonably low production
costs, and this is unfavorable to those regular oil refineries, it
says.
</P>
<P>
The joint announcement also calls for the integration of some
illegal oil refineries into the public security administration in
oil producing areas.

<P>
MANILA, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Belgian engineer Lieven de la
Marche was freed safely to the Philippine government early
Wednesday morning in the southern Philippines after 10 days in
captivity, Philippines News Agency (PNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
PNA said Basilan Province Governor Wahab Akbar, the chief
government negotiator, eventually effected his release in Ipil of
Zamboanga del Sur Province from the hands of the Moro Islamic
Liberation Front (MILF) after he convinced kidnappers to free
their hostage.
</P>
<P>
Akbar said he gave nothing to the captors "except a personal
item" in exchange for the captive's liberty.
</P>
<P>
Governor Akbar and Department of Agrarian Reform Secretary
Horacio Morales left Zamboanga City for Ipil Tuesday afternoon and
stayed in Zamboanga del Sur until the Belgian captive was freed
and recovered safely.
</P>
<P>
PNA said the Philippine police and military authorities had
lain low while the negotiation process had stepped up for the
release of the victim.
</P>
<P>
Among those who welcomed De la Marche were his family, his
friend Erick Bracke, local government officials, military and
police authorities.
</P>
<P>
De la Marche, an agriculture engineer working for the country's
agrarian reform program, was snatched with his visiting friend
Eric Bracke on June 13 by three gunmen outside Zamboanga City
while on a boating holiday with Filipino friends.
</P>
<P>
Bracke was released in Basilan Province on June 18 after Akbar
gave kidnappers 100,000 pesos (2,500 U.S. dollars), a motorcycle
and the governor's own .45-caliber pistol.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Redesignate S. Lankan Rebels as Terrorists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government is most likely
to officially redesignate the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam
(LTTE) in Sri Lanka as a terrorist organization, press reports
here said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Given the LTTE's actions during the past year as cataloged in
our annual terrorism report, a redesignation is likely, although
the final decision is the secretary's (Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright)," said Karl F. Inderfurth, assistant secretary
of state for South Asian affairs, in an exclusive interview with
Daily News.
</P>
<P>
The legislation for this purpose will come up for renewal in
October this year.
</P>
<P>
Two years ago the LTTE was officially designated a terrorist
organization by the United States, which meant that it is illegal
for anyone in the country to fund or provide any material support
for it.
</P>
<P>
Under the law, violations are subject to civil and criminal
penalties including confiscation of property.
</P>
<P>
In its annual report on terrorism, the U.S. State Department
said that the LTTE "conducted significant levels of terrorist
activity in 1998," accusing the rebels of having attacked
government troops, bombed economic and infrastructure targets and
assassinated political opponents.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE has appealed against the legislation in a U.S. court
but Inderfurth said he believed the case was open and shut.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels have been fighting a separatist war against the
Sri Lankan government since 1983 for a Tamil homeland in the north
and east of the country.

<P>
BRASILIA, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Brazil's trade with its South
American Common Market (Mercosur) partners diminished 29.5 percent
in the first five months of this year, compared with the same
period of 1998, the local press reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Brazil's exports to the other three countries of the bloc,
namely Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay, came to 2.61 billion U.S.
dollars and imports reached 2.65 billion dollars, falling 28.6
percent and 30.4 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
Brazil's weak commerce with Mercosur is mainly due to a
decrease of around 40 percent in automobile exports to Argentina.
</P>
<P>
Statistics also showed a reduction in Brazil's imports from the
European Union and the United States, down 9.1 percent and 15.7
percent respectively in the same period.
</P>
<P>
But Brazil's exports to the United States and the Middle East
grew 2 percent and 7.6 percent respectively, thanks to the
continuous economic expansion of the U.S. and the demand for sugar
and soy oil in Iran.

recently, participants said that the cities have a series of
measures to promote shared funds, personnel, information,
technology, and natural resources.
</P>
<P>
Railways, highways, airports and many other kinds of
infrastructure have been improved to better link these cities and
a joint campaign was started last October to introduce scenic
spots and tourist products of the delta to visitors.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai has provided funding for some 200 chain stores across
the delta in cooperating with local firms and is now considering
establishing a new technology service center open to all cities in
the delta.
</P>
<P>
While enhancing cooperation among the cities, they also have a
clear separation of functions and key development areas during the
reform of the economic structure. An official with the municipal
government said that Shanghai is now shifting its industries and
product mix to develop the municipality into a monetary, economic
and trade center and to develop new and high-tech technologies.
Shanghai will no longer take the manufacturing of such electronic
appliances as air-conditioners, refrigerators and washing machines
as a pillar industrial sector.
</P>
<P>
The cities of Suzhou, Wuxi and Changzhou in Jiangsu Province,
which are close to Shanghai, are also considering the development
of new and high-tech industries as the major part of their
economies. For Nanjing and the areas around it, petrochemical,
motor vehicle and machine-building industries will be the key
developing sectors.
</P>
<P>
The cities in north Zhejiang Province have been centering on
developing sea transportation, petrochemical, textile, food and
clothing industries.

<HEADLINE> Fujian Intensifies Efforts to Control Flood, Clean up River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, June 23 (Xinhua) -- South China's Fujian province is
launching a vigorous program to improve flood control along a
major local river, Jinjiang, while efforts are also being
redoubled to clean up Minjiang, another key waterway.
</P>
<P>
In the bid, Quanzhou, a coastal city in Fujian, has earmarked
460 million yuan for improving flood-control works along the lower
reaches of the Jinjiang River and for dredging the river course
this year and next.
</P>
<P>
A leading group has been formed, under the leadership of mayor
Shi Yongkang, to take responsibility for reconstruction of the
roads behind the embankments built along the Jinjiang River, which
runs through the port city.
</P>
<P>
Jinjiang is one of four major rivers in the coastal province of
Fujian. Rampant flooding along the river and Minjiang has been a
threat to the lives and properties of local residents.
</P>
<P>
In another development, the provincial government of Fujian has
also stepped up efforts to rein in pollution on the Minjiang River,
which originates from mountainous areas in the north and empties
into the sea at this provincial capital.
</P>
<P>
In the past three years, the province has spent more than 300
million yuan on pollution-control efforts. Some 470 enterprises
that caused severe pollution on the river were punished in the
campaign.
</P>
<P>
The water quality of the Minjiang River, a major water source
for residents of cities like Fuzhou, has been improving in recent
years.

<HEADLINE> Investments Drop in First 5 Months in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Investments in the Philippines for
the first five months amounted to only 31 billion pesos (775
million U.S. dollars), 76 percent lower than the 133.6 billion
pesos (3.34 billion U.S. dollars) recorded in the same period last
year, the Philippine Post reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted data of the Board of Investments (BoI) as
saying the BoI will have to chalk up an investment of 69 billion
pesos (1.725 billion dollars) in June alone for it to achieve the
target of 100 billion pesos (2.5 billion dollars) in investment
for the first half of the year.
</P>
<P>
Despite the continued slowdown, BoI managing head Melito
Salazar remained confident that his agency will achieve its
investment target for the year of 400 billion pesos (10 billion
dollars), the paper said.
</P>
<P>
According to Salazar, 25 percent of the 400 billion pesos (10
billion dollars) will be generated in the first half of the year
and the remaining 75 percent to be produced in the second half.
</P>
<P>
While admitting that big-ticket projects such as infrastructure
and public facilities have been more subdued thus year, Salazar
said continuing and future discussions with companies in these
sectors are expected to result in increased investments before the
end of the year.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that small and medium-sized enterprises have made
their presence felt as they account for 65 percent of the total
projects approved by the BoI during the first six months of 1999.
