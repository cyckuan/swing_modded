<P>
LONDON, July 24 (Xinhua) -- "Sceptical" Sinn Fein's "considered
verdict" on the Northern Ireland peace is due next week, BBC
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The party's national executive met in Dublin to review the last
10 days of political developments, in particular the failure to
set up a power-sharing executive.
</P>
<P>
No decisions were taken at Saturday's meeting but BBC quoted
Sinn Fein sources as saying that there will be a major
announcement next week in Belfast.
</P>
<P>
"Sinn Fein will judge the review on whether or not we believe
it can make a difference," said Martin Ferris, a former IRA leader
in Portlaoise Prison.
</P>
<P>
"Many are sceptical and see this as an exercise in providing
unionists with another opportunity to re-negotiate the Good Friday
Agreement," he added.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein has already had preliminary contact with Senator
George Mitchell, who will chair the review of the implementation
of the Good Friday Agreement in September.

<HEADLINE> French President Concludes Visit to Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 24 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
Saturday concluded his two-day visit to Nigeria, the first of a
Western leader to the most populous African country since its
resuming of civilian rule on May 29 this year.
</P>
<P>
Chirac, on his third leg of a four-nation west African tour,
had met his Nigerian counterpart Olusegun Obasanjo, some
parliamentary leaders and business executives.
</P>
<P>
"Today, a new Nigeria is rising before our eyes, a Nigeria
which has turned the page of history and entered the modern
world," the French leader told Obasanjo.
</P>
<P>
He also praised oil-producing Nigeria's role in the west
African region as a peace maker and its potential role as an
engine for economic growth in the whole continent.
</P>
<P>
"Nigeria is a major country in Africa. One whole region of the
continent depends on for peace and prosperity," he told a
gathering of French and Nigerian businessmen Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"It has already played a growing and decisive role in crisis
resolution and perhaps, in the future, it will become a locomotive
for the African economy," he added.
</P>
<P>
Chirac said that France could play a special role in helping
Nigeria achieve that objective. "We are ready, if you so
desire, to join with you in an ambitious economic relationship,"
he said in a message to the Nigerian business community.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Obasanjo told a joint news conference with Chirac that
he was determined to root up corruption and insecurity in his
country.
</P>
<P>
This is also the first visit by a French president to the
English- speaking regional power. Analysts say that the visit
demonstrates a significant adjustment of French diplomacy, showing
France is to pay more attention on the English-speaking Africa, in
addition to its traditional emphasis on the French-speaking half
of the continent.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria is paying the visit considerable importance. France is
already Nigeria's fourth largest trading partner, only behind the
United States, Britain and Germany.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the Nigerian-French trade activities are on
the rise, with French businesses, particularly in the oil and
construction sectors having gained an increasingly larger share in
the oil-rich west African country.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria is also eyeing on calling for France into its aid in
relieving its debt estimated at 30 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
But the death of Moroccan King Hassan II Friday downplayed a
little bit the atmosphere of the visit.
</P>
<P>
The announcement of the death coincided with a state banquet
offered in Chirac's honor by Obasanjo. Planned toasts and
entertainment were therefore cancelled.
</P>
<P>
"The world has lost a great statesman, a man who had marked
international relations through his experience and inspiration,"
Chirac said in a message to Morocco's crown prince, emphasizing he
had learned of the death with "immense sadness."
</P>
<P>
Unidentified sources relating to Chirac's aides said that the
French president would travel to Cameroun Saturday but would leave
overnight for Morocco, shortening his two-day staying there.

<P>
BAGHDAD, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Iraq and Tunisia started trade
talks here on Saturday and the two countries pledged to expand
commercial exchanges, the Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The talks were co-chaired by Iraqi Trade Minister Mohammed
Mehdi Saleh and his Tunisian counterpart Mondher Zenaidi, said
INA.
</P>
<P>
Saleh reiterated in the talks Iraq's readiness to expand
commercial exchanges with Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
The minister hailed the current economic and commercial
cooperation between Iraq and Tunisia, pledging that Tunisian
companies would get good contracts under the current phase of the
oil-for-food program sanctioned by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The oil-for-food deal, now in its sixth phase which started on
May 25, allows Iraq to export 5.2 billion U.S. dollars worth of
oil in six months to buy food, medicine and other humanitarian
supplies for its nearly 24 million people.
</P>
<P>
Iraq earlier said that Arab countries got 50 percent of Iraq's
contracts in the past five phases of the program.
</P>
<P>
For his part, the visiting Tunisian minister expressed his
satisfaction over the cooperation between the two countries.

SINGAPROE, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Minister Tang

splitting the motherland and return to the "one China" principle.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Islanders Start Repairing Quake-damaged Houses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Amid fears of more quakes, residents
of Bangladesh's Maheshkali island in the Bay of Bengal, where an
earthquake killed five people and injured more than 100 others on
Thursday, have started repairing their damaged houses, the BSS
news agency reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Most of the tremor-affected people were found on Saturday to be
engaged in repairing their houses damaged by the earthquake, which
preliminary estimates said affected about 25,000 families,
rendered 2,000 dwelling houses unfit for use and partially damaged
50,000.
</P>
<P>
There was no report of further deaths except the five
casualties reported earlier, a local official was quoted as
saying. The actual assessment of the destruction was yet to be
made, the BSS said.
</P>
<P>
The first wave of the tremor hit the offshore island, 25
kilometers from the southeastern sea resort of Cox's Bazar,
Thursday afternoon and lasted for about 16 seconds, and the second
wave shocked the island at midnight, followed by a third wave
early Friday morning.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian President Calls for National Unity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian President Benjamin
Mkapa Saturday called on the people to enhance national unity and
not to be divided on ethnic, political or religious differences.
</P>
<P>
The president sounded the warning in his national address to
mark the 20th anniversary of the Kagera War against aggression by
former Ugandan dictator Idi Amin, who was defeated and fled his
country.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in Bukoba Rural District of the northwestern Kagera
Region which borders Uganda, Mkapa said that the war was just and
noble as Idi Amin had humiliated Tanzanians not only by invading
Tanzania but also by occupying part of it.
</P>
<P>
"Let those who doubt this solidarity come and visit Kabwoba
village and see the names of the fallen heroes written on the
tower," he said. He said the list contains names of Moslems,
Christians and non-religious people.
</P>
<P>
The president called on Tanzanians to consolidate this national
identity, issuing warn against a few individuals who are trying to
divide Tanzanians on religious grounds.
</P>
<P>
He labeled such people as fools that should be shunned at all
costs.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa commended soldiers of the Tanzania People's Defense Force
for sacrificing their lives in defense of their country.
</P>
<P>
He also paid special tribute to the founding father of the
nation, Julius Nyerere who led Tanzanian forces to repel and
eventually defeat the Amin's troops, reports from Kagera said.
Amin, who was president of Uganda from 1971 to 1979, lives in
exile in Saudi Arabia at present.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, President Mkapa will be joined by his Ugandan
counterpart Yoweri Museveni to commemorate the fallen Tanzanian
heroes in the war.
</P>
<P>
The celebration activities will be held at a Tanzanian army
camp in Muleba District in Kagera Region.

<HEADLINE> Scottish Firm to Finance Tanzania Coffee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dar es Salaam, July 24 (Xinhua) -- A Scotland-based financial
firm, Global Capital Universal Limited, has agreed to provide a
loan of seven billion shillings (about 8.75 million U.S. dollars)
to boost coffee production in Tanzania, a report from Moshi in
north Tanzania said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The specific objective of the project is to increase coffee
output per hectare from the present 150 kilograms to 600 kilograms
within five years, said Alphonce Lyimo, Managing Director of the
Agricultural Industrial Chemical Services Limited in Dar es
Salaam.
</P>
<P>
The project initiated by the Tanzanian company has been
approved by the World Bank and the Tanzanian government, Lyimo
said in Moshi recently.
</P>
<P>
The managing director said that higher coffee yield can be
attained by improving extension services and by providing coffee
producers with sufficient inputs in time.
</P>
<P>
He explained field trials by his company in Moshi showed coffee
 production could rise to 1,000 kilograms per hectare in some
areas.
</P>
<P>
The Scottish company, a financial broker in which well-to-do
pensioners from developed countries invest their money to
stimulate development activities worldwide, intends to release the
loan in installment at an interest rate of three percent.
</P>
<P>
The loan recipient would enjoy a one-year grace period, Lyimo
said.
</P>
<P>
When the project takes off, farmers in these areas stand to
benefit a lot as agro-chemical will be readily available to combat
coffee berry diseases or coffee leaf rust, the managing director
added.
</P>
<P>
Coffee, the leading cash crop in Tanzania, earned the east
African country 120 million dollars from 1996 to 1998, or 15
percent of all commodity exports.

<HEADLINE> Office of Overseas Chinese Affairs Supports Ban on Falun Gong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The Office of Overseas Chinese
Affairs of the State Council said today that it fully supports the
Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee's ban on Falun
Gong.
</P>
<P>
It said numerous facts have demonstrated that the Falun Dafa
and its Falun Gong branches manipulated by Li Hongzhi are illegal
organizations spreading superstitious and heretical ideas, eroding
people's minds, and disrupting social stability in the name of
physical fitness exercises.
</P>
<P>
It said the CPC Central Committee's decision to outlaw Falun
Gong is a serious ideological and political struggle between
Marxism and anti-Marxism, between materialism and spiritualism,
and between atheism and theism.
</P>
<P>
All officials, Party members and ordinary employees with the
office strongly condemn Li Hongzhi, the founder of Falun Gong, for
concocting Falun Gong in order to erode people's minds and disturb
public order and social stability.
</P>
<P>
The ban on the illegal organization is timely, wise, and
correct, it said, adding that the resolution of the Falun Gong
issue will help safeguard long-term social and political stability
and unity, and ensure China's success in socialist modernization
and push ahead reform and opening.
</P>
<P>
It said the ban on Falun Gong represents the fundamental
interests and common aspirations of the Chinese people living
overseas.
</P>
<P>
It hoped that all Chinese people living overseas learn from the
mass media and other information channels the essence of Li
Hongzhi, and realize the harmful influence caused by Li and his
illegal organization.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Ministry Supports Government Ban on  Falun Gong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Foreign Ministry has
said that it is imperative to popularize the Chinese government's
decision among overseas Chinese and students who practice Falun
Gong, expose the nature of Falun Gong organizations, and the life
and activities of Li Hongzhi, in order to enable them to realize
the harm Falun Gong organizations caused to public order and
social stability.
</P>
<P>
It is also imperative to firmly fight against Li Hongzhi's
attempts to collude with anti-China forces abroad to sabotage
China's stability, according to a meeting held today by the
ministry's Party committee.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan has urged all communist Party
members of the ministry to understand the nature of Falun Gong,
and make a clear distinction between materialism and idealism,
atheism and theism, and science and superstition.
</P>
<P>
Members of the ministry's Party committee pointed out that the
Chinese government has taken actions against Falun Gong
organizations according to laws and banning social organizations
which are not registered and engage in illegal activities.
</P>
<P>
Launching an attack against illegal organizations which harm
the rights and interests of society and the public is a common
practice in all countries, they noted.
</P>
<P>
Falun Gong organizations have spread malicious fallacies and
have caused great damage to the lives of many people and society
in general. The purpose of the Chinese government's banning such
organizations is to protect the human rights of the entire Chinese
people, including the victims, they said.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Residents Reject Falun Gong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Several sports enthusiasts in
Beijing told Xinhua today that physical exercise should be done in
a scientific way.
</P>
<P>
They share the view that Falun Gong advocates superstition
which harms both the people and the country, and so therefore it
should be wiped out.
</P>
<P>
Wang Yankun, a retired official, has kept up his morning
exercises every day since stepping down from the Beijing Municipal
Research Institute of Chemical Industry. He turned down an offer
to practice Falun Gong several years ago.
</P>
<P>
"The essence of Falun Gong is the spread of superstition. It
runs counter to a scientific way to build the body. As a member of
the Communist Party, I don't believe the malicious fallacies of Li
Hongzhi," he said.
</P>
<P>
There are many people like Wang Yankun in Beijing. Tong Xiulin,
a retired official, used to suffer from several diseases including
hepatitis and high blood pressure, but she has been recovered by
doing taijiquan exercises and taking medication.
</P>
<P>
"it is utterly absurd to spread the idea of refusing to take
medicine when one is ill. It is opposite to modern medical science,
" she said.
</P>
<P>
"Someone advised me to do Falun Gong exercises, but I don't
believe in it," she added.
</P>
<P>
Tong and other local residents have rejected Falun Gong because
they have witnessed family tragedies caused by Falun Gong.
</P>
<P>
According to the Western District Physical Culture and Sports
Committee (WDPCSC), the western district of Beijing has more than
400,000 sports participants, and only 3,000 of them are Falun Gong
practitioners.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Lianquan, director of the WDPCSC, said, "All kinds of
body-building activities are good for people's health, family
harmony, and social stability. As a sports official, I teach
people to exercise in a scientific, healthy, and civilized way."

Committee decision to ban Falun Gong.
</P>
<P>
Participants to a TAO meeting held here today said the decision
to solve the Falun Gong problem is "timely and absolutely correct"
and has won broad-based support from Party members, officials, and
ordinary people throughout China.
</P>
<P>
Li Hongzhi and his Falun Dafa disseminate theism and feudal
superstition and negate scientific truth, which runs counter to
modern science and civilization. He deceived people with his
malicious fallacies, intending to manipulate Falun Gong followers
mentally and organizationally.
</P>
<P>
The CPC Central Committee decision to ban and expose Falun Gong
represents the aspirations of the Party and of the people. We
should have a clear-cut stand and resolutely take part in the
struggle against Falun Gong, the participants said.
</P>
<P>
Li Hongzhi and his Falun Dafa offered us a negative example,
and all Party members and officials of the Taiwan Affairs Office
have got an education on Marxist materialism and atheism and
enhanced political insights.

<P>
At the meeting, the participants also said they will do a

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Underlines Flood-Control Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji has
called for increased efforts in flood control along the Yangtze
River.
</P>
<P>
The call was made in a speech delivered at a conference on
flood-control work on July 13, which was published today.
</P>
<P>
Saying he was "very concerned" about the flood-control
situation along the Yangtze, the premier said three points need to
be emphasized to overcome floods this year: conducting a sound
analysis of the flood-control situation, drafting thorough plans
and making good preparations for flood-prevention, and ensuring
the quality of water control projects.
</P>
<P>
"The flood-control work is of great significance this year
since we are to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the founding of
New China, and Macao is expected to return to the embrace of the
motherland," Zhu said, adding that controlling floods has a direct
bearing on China's reform, development and stability.
</P>
<P>
However, Zhu said he is not optimistic about the flood-control
situation along the Yangtze River, considering the early arrival
of the rainy season, heavy precipitation, inadequate flood-
prevention-capacity of water control projects along the river, and
lack of preparations in some areas.
</P>
<P>
"Leaders at all levels in the provinces and municipalities
along the Yangtze River must keep a clear mind about the flood-
control situation and prepare for the worst floods and the most
severe flooding," the premier stressed.
</P>
<P>
Zhu continued to say that thorough plans and good preparations
are needed for victory in flood-control work along the Yangtze.
</P>
<P>
A responsibility system needs to be adopted which will hold
officials responsible for flood-control, and thorough inspections
need to be made to rule out quality problems in flood-prevention
projects, he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhu added that flood-control materials and rescue teams should
be made available for timely flood relief, and dikes should be
watched around the clock to detect danger as early as possible.
</P>
<P>
Also, flood-relief efforts need to be intensified in flood-hit
areas, and all local governments and all departments should make
concerted efforts to fight floods.
</P>
<P>
Zhu also stressed quality control in water control projects,
advocating a responsibility system, scientific design, public
bidding, strict supervision, and strict management of project
funds.
</P>
<P>
Zhu concluded his speech by pledging to effect a permanent cure
for flooding along the Yangtze River, which includes a ban on
logging and increased afforestation on the upper reaches of the
Yangtze.

<HEADLINE> Indian Scientists Claim to Develop Cheap JE Vaccine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Indian scientists here claimed
to have found a cheap method to produce a vaccine against Japanese
encephalitis, which kills over 1,000 people each year in the South
Asian country.
</P>
<P>
"We have developed a tissue culture-based method to produce the
vaccine in a pure form cheaply," Sudhanshu Vrati, head of the JE
research team at the National Institute of Immunology (NII), said
here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Though a JE vaccine has been producing at the India's Central
Research Institute (CRI) with a Japanese strain of the virus, high
cost of the vaccine has limited its use for mass vaccination
programs in the country.
</P>
<P>
The vaccine produced at CRI sometimes contains protein
impurities which are known to cause allergic reactions in humans.
</P>
<P>
The NII team said it used an Indian strain, collected from
south parts of the country, to develop the vaccine.
</P>
<P>
Vrati said that the method practiced at CRI needs a large
number of mice because their brain cells are used to grow the
virus while his method is a cleaner one as it is produced in a
culture-medium and does not require any animal.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, it would take at least another two years to
produce a commercial JE vaccine as toxicity, efficacy and safety
tests for the vaccine were yet to be carried out.
</P>
<P>
JE outbreaks occurred in many states of the country during the
last three decades. The virus was first isolated in India in 1958.

Many family members of practitioners have been complaining that
Falun Gong has damaged their families.
</P>
<P>
Shen Yonghui and Huang Shaohuai told a tragic story of their
lovely daughter Huang Lin, who was killed by Falun Gong. Huang Lin,
a university student, began practicing Falun Gong in 1997. One day,
she told her mother, "Master Li Hongzhi said that I am sinful and
urged me to receive certain punishment."
</P>
<P>
From that day on, she refused to take medicine or eat. On
September 15, 1997, without food or drink for nine days, the girl
died. "The central government's decision on banning Falun Gong is
very right," said her mother.
</P>
<P>
Feng Zhiying, a psychiatrist, said that hallucinations are a
typical symptoms found among Falun Gong practitioners, especially
those who lack mental and spiritual ballast. The disease can be
called "psychosis caused by superstition and witchery."
</P>
<P>
Cai Shenming, a grocer, said he knew more than a dozen people
who killed themselves because of practicing Falun Gong. "Li
Hongzhi's theory kills people without spilling any blood," he said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Floods Recede at Middle &AMP; Lower Reaches of Yangtze </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Water levels at the middle and lower
reaches of the Yangtze River, China's longest, started to recede
today after the largest flood peak this year passed Wuhan, capital
of central China's Hubei Province.
</P>
<P>
Heavy rains in areas along the Yangtze River basin and water
from the upper reaches of the Yangtze have combined to form the
third and highest flood peak this year, pushing water levels at
the middle and lower reaches close to the record high of last year.
</P>
<P>
Devastating floods along the Yangtze and in northeast China
provinces killed more than 3,000 people last year, and resulted in
economic losses of 264.2 billion yuan (about 31.7 billion U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The flooding scale and the water levels are close to the record
floods of last year, said Wang Jun, an official with the Yangtze
River Water Resources Committee.
</P>
<P>
In spite of surging water levels, the floods have flowed past
areas along the Yangtze without causing great damage, even in the
most vulnerable points such as Jingjiang and Honghu.
</P>
<P>
However, Premier Zhu Rongji said in a speech made public today
that the flood-control situation along the Yangtze is not
optimistic and called for redoubled anti-flood efforts.
</P>
<P>
Since the catastrophic floods last year, the central government
alone has earmarked 8.775 billion yuan to consolidate dikes and
dredge the river's course.
</P>
<P>
Another reason for the receding flood is that some areas along
the river have resettled residents to make way for the flood
waters, thus easing flood-control pressure and reducing the cost
of flood-control.
</P>
<P>
In the hardest-hit provinces such as Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, and
Anhui, the central government has injected 3.5 billion yuan into
projects including the resettlement of residents for flood
diversion.

<HEADLINE> Egypt's Oil Industry Structure Changing: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The structure of Egypt's oil and gas
industry is changing due to declining crude oil production,
rapidly rising natural gas output and steadily increasing
consumption of petroleum products.
</P>
<P>
One of the clearest changes these factors have brought about to
the industry has been to push Egypt, in financial terms, toward
being a net oil importer, the latest issue of the London-based
Middle East Economic Digest (MEED) said.
</P>
<P>
The most recent figures on the oil balance of payments
published by the Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation (EGPC)
show a small surplus of 113 million U.S. dollars in 1998, compared
with a 877 million dollars surplus in 1997.
</P>
<P>
MEED said the disappearance of the surplus stems from a number
of factors, besides the fluctuations in world oil prices. In the
past five years, Egypt steadily reduced its crude production due
to the crumble of oil prices in the world markets.
</P>
<P>
Egypt was producing about 840,000 barrels a day (b/d) in 1996.
The amount has since dwindled to about 785,000 b/d at present.
</P>
<P>
Over the same period when crude output was cut down,
consumption rose to 450,000 b/d from 400,000 b/d this year in
Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Output reduction and consumption increase have prompted lower
export volumes. Crude and products exports are now about 275,000
b/d, compared with 360,000 b/d in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The most important factor in the changes in Egypt's oil balance
of payments is increased gas production. Cheaper price and
friendliness to the environment have lured power stations and
vehicles to be converted to gas.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of 1999, Egypt's gas output stood at 45.31
million cubic meters a day (cm/d). As the Obeiyed and Khalda areas
in the Western Desert and gas fields in the Gulf of Suez have been
brought on stream, the gas output will be pushed to 65.14 million
cm/d in the second half of 1999.
</P>
<P>
The gas production will rise by a further 14.16 million-16.99
million cm/d at the end of 1999 and in early 2000 when a series of
fields off the Mediterranean coast come on stream.

<HEADLINE> Sudan Denies Stumbling In Ties With Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese Foreign Minister Mustafa
Osman Ismail on Saturday said there is no stumbling but steady
progress in the Sudanese-Egyptian relations.
</P>
<P>
Ismail made the remarks at a news conference upon his return
from Nairobi, Kenya, where he held a round of negotiations with
the Sudanese People's Liberation Army, the leading rebel faction
in southern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
He said he has received a message from his Egyptian counterpart
Amr Moussa on the Khartoum-Cairo relations, adding that contacts
are under way for the normalization of relations.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese official daily "Al Anbaa" reported Saturday that
there are indications of an Egyptian retreat from the agreement
recently reached between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The report was referring to recent remarks made by some
Egyptian officials that Sudan are continuing to support terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The tension in the Sudanese-Egyptian ties started when the
Khartoum government assumed power in 1989 and worsened
after an assassination attempt at Egyptian President Mubarak in
1995, which Egypt accused Sudan of having orchestrated.
</P>
<P>
The bilateral ties, however, witnessed some improvement over
the past few months, following instructions by Sudanese President
Omar Bashir to reconsider the issue of Egyptian properties
confiscated by the Sudanese Government in the early 90's.

<HEADLINE> hke072519 -Vietnam, U.S. Make Significant Progress in Trade Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, July 25 (Xinhua) -- An agreement in principle on the
terms of a Bilateral Trade Agreement was reached by the
negotiators from the United States and Vietnam on Sunday,
manifesting a significant progress in the Vietnam-U.S. trade
talks.
</P>
<P>
The agreement addresses issues concerning trade in goods and
services, protection of intellectual property, and investment
relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached after the discussion between
Vietnam's Trade Minister Truong Dinh Tuyen and U.S. Deputy Trade
Representative Richard Fisher.
</P>
<P>
Fisher arrived in Hanoi on July 22, but officials from both
sides had resumed talks in Hanoi on July 20 that were extension of
the eighth round of negotiation held in Washington last month.
Heading the two delegations were chief U.S. trade negotiator for
Vietnam Joe Damond and Nguyen Dinh Luong, assistant to Vietnam's
Trade Minister.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam and the United States established diplomatic relations
in July 1995, but have not normalized economic relations.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam and the United States have already had eight rounds of
trade talks. After continued efforts, especially by Vietnam, the
two countries gradually narrowed their remaining differences.
</P>
<P>
According to Vietnam's Trade Ministry, two-way trade between
the two countries last year stood at 750 million U.S. dollars.
Vietnam exported 534 million dollars worth of products to the
United States, mainly coffee, crude oil, garments, meat,
fisheries, footwear, vegetables, rubber and ceramics.
</P>
<P>
Last year Vietnam imported 200 million dollars worth of goods
from the United States, half of which was for machinery and
equipment, and some fertilizers, chemicals, metals and motor
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Since the lifting of the U.S. embargo on Vietnam five years
ago, many U.S. businesses have invested in Vietnam. The United
States is currently Vietnam's ninth biggest investor with 1.2
billion dollars pledged in 92 projects.
</P>
<P>
However, many Vietnamese items are difficult to export to the
United States due to the discriminative import duties.
</P>
<P>
After arriving at an agreement in principle on the terms of a
Bilateral Trade Agreement, both sides of the United States and
Vietnam will work to finalize the technical details in order to
submit a formal agreement to their governments and competent
bodies to approve.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnam, U.S. trade agreement will pave the way for
normalizing trade relations between the two countries. It will
also expedite Vietnam's entry into the World Trade organization.
</P>
<P>
Many Vietnamese businesses are confident that once a trade
agreement is signed, the U.S. market will be wide open to them.

<HEADLINE> People's Daily Article Calls for Strengthening Party Discipline (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 25 (Xinhua) -- China's leading newspaper "People'
s Daily" will publish a commentator's article Monday calling for
strengthened discipline of the Communist Party of China (CPC)
through solving the Falun Gong problem.
</P>
<P>
The article points out that some Party members have
participated in Falun Gong activities and some even became leading
members in the illegal organization, bringing a negative influence
on society.
</P>
<P>
This situation makes it a matter of urgency to strengthen Party
discipline to abolish the slackness among some Party organizations,
the article says, adding it is critical that the Falun Gong
problem be first dealt with from within the Party.
</P>
<P>
Fierce international competition, as well as the hard work of
reform and opening and stability have made it imperative to build
the Party in a strict manner. The issue of Falun Gong has helped
people better understand this situation, it says.
</P>
<P>
It notes that the Party's political ambitions are to build
China into a socialist country with Chinese characteristics and
ultimately realize communism. However, Falun Gong has propagated
fallacious ideas such as a "doomsday theory" and a "way to heaven"
which go against the Party's doctrines and discipline.
</P>
<P>
If Li Hongzhi's heretical theories spread, the Party's
foundation will be shaken, and the great cause will be undermined,
it stresses.
</P>
<P>
It adds that communists believe in science, which is in
accordance with the law of history. Therefore, Party members must
adhere to the scientific world view expounded by Marxism, and hold
to materialism by opposing spiritualism, and follow atheism by
opposing theism.
</P>
<P>
Facts have demonstrated the importance of teaching the Marxist
world view among the whole Party, the article says, and only with
an improved Marxist theoretical education can the Party build an
ideological Great Wall to resist the entry of wrong and fallacious
ideas, the article notes.
</P>
<P>
The article also stresses the importance of the Party's
organizational life which has enabled the Party survive so many
difficult situations. However, for a period of time, there has
been slackness among some Party organizations, and some Party
members have not attended Party meetings for a long time, and they
have seldom studied the Party's lines and policies or made
criticisms and self-criticisms. As a result, they became captives
of erroneous theories.

<HEADLINE> Ministries Urge Eradication of Falun Gong's Heretical Ideas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 25 (Xinhua) -- A leading official of the Ministry
of Health has called for the eradication of Falun Gong's heretical
ideas, saying that otherwise, people's health can not be
guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, he said that the theories of Falun
Dafa lack medical data to support them, and they are the words of
mountebanks, or illusions of the practitioners.
</P>
<P>
He said that although some diseases might be alleviated a
little, this is just a result of the patients' psychological
suggestibility, rather than a Falun Gong miracle.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that patients should go to the hospital when they
are ill.
</P>
<P>
He said that many Falun Gong practitioners have died because
they refused to receive medical treatment, believing that their
illness could be cured by Falun Gong. Some people have even become
psychotic and homicidal or suicidal, thus sabotaging social
stability.
</P>
<P>
He urged doctors to adopt a serious attitude toward treating
Falun Gong sufferers.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Culture has made public a circular calling for
a ban on audio and video products concerning Falun Gong.
</P>
<P>
The circular says that any audio or video products carrying
Falun Gong materials are illegal, and they must be confiscated and
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
It urges cultural administrations to start a nationwide
inspection of cinemas and shops and punish those who sell, rent,
or show such products.
</P>
<P>
The "Seeking Truth" magazine of the Communist Party of China
Central Committee will also publish a special edition on Monday
criticizing Falun Dafa and its founder, Li Hongzhi.
</P>
<P>
The magazine will carry important articles and circulars
regarding the ban on Falun Gong, along with analysis by leading
theorists on Falun Gong's superstitious nature.

<HEADLINE> China, U.S. Foreign Ministers Meet in Singapore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Minister Tang
Jiaxuan met with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright here
on Sunday and their discussions focused on bilateral relations and
the Taiwan question.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Tang told Albright that the Chinese
government always attaches importance to the development of the
China-U.S. relationship, and that a healthy and stable Sino-U.S.
relationship conforms to the fundamental interests of both the
Chinese people and the American people, and the people in all
countries of the world.
</P>
<P>
But Tang pointed out that the Sino-U.S. relationship has been
seriously damaged by the U.S. bombing of the Chinese embassy in
Belgrade, according to a Chinese spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
Tang said China finds it hard to accept the explanation and the
so-called "conclusion" made by the U.S. side hitherto. He urged
the U.S. side to give full recognition to the serious nature of
the bombing incident, give serious attention to the Chinese side's
solemn demands and take practical action to remedy the serious
damage to the China-U.S. relationship.
</P>
<P>
Albright said the U.S. attaches high importance to its
relationship with China. She repeated the U.S. previous statements
that the bombing of the Chinese embassy was a tragic accident and
said U.S. President Bill Clinton, herself, and other
administration officials have repeatedly formally apologized to
the Chinese side for the bombing.
</P>
<P>
She said the U.S. was willing to take practical action to seek
a proper settlement of the issue so as to return the U.S.-China
relations to their normal track.
</P>
<P>
Albright reaffirmed the U.S. government's commitment to the
"one China" policy and said Washington will not change this
policy.
</P>
<P>
Tang Jiaxuan also expounded the Chinese side's solemn stand on
the Taiwan question. The Taiwan question has always been the most
important and sensitive core issue in the China-U.S. relationship
and the proper handling by the U.S. of the Taiwan issue holds the
key to the healthy and steady development of the bilateral
relations, the Chinese foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
He said Lee Teng-hui recently openly defined the cross-Straits
relations as "state-to-state" ties and that the essence of the
"two-states theory" is to deny the "one China" principle and to
separate Taiwan from the Chinese territory.
</P>
<P>
As the Taiwan question is one that relates to China's
sovereignty and territorial integrity, it is naturally that Lee
Teng-hui's separatist remarks aimed at splitting the country have
met with the firm opposition from the whole Chinese people,
including Taiwan compatriots, Tang said.
</P>
<P>
He urged the U.S. side to abide by the three communiques and
honor all commitments it has made on Taiwan, which is vital to
stabilizing the situation across the Taiwan Strait and returning
bilateral relations to a normal track.

<HEADLINE> Stomach Cancer is Main Killer in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Stomach cancer has been the
biggest killer among all the types of cancers in China, with the
death rate among the male rising by 10.98 percent, while the rate
among the female being 6.32 percent up in the past 20 years, the
latest statistics show.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics from the Tumor Hospital under the
Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, the death rate of the disease
in the 1990s in China has been 30.12 per 100,000 for male, and 13.
8 per 100,000 for female, accounting for 23.24 percent of the
deaths caused by cancers, the highest among all the countries in
the world.
</P>
<P>
And the death rate of the cancer of stomach differs greatly
between the rural and urban people. The figure in urban areas is
now some 19.44 per 100,000, 25 percent lower, while that in rural
areas is now 27.16 per 100,000, 25 percent up.
</P>
<P>
Scientists explained that improved living conditions,
nutritious diet and a healthy life style among the urban residents
have been the main causes for the decrease. While the intake of
pickled food, smoking, psychological hurts, and stomach ailments
have caused the rise in the rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Aging has been another main factor. Surveys show that in the
last two decades, the penalty rate among the people between 30 to
59 has dropped, while that for the people above 60 has shown a
rapid increase.
</P>
<P>
In general, however, the incidence of esophageal, stomach
nasopharynx, and cervical cancers has dropped in China, but lung,
breast, colon and rectal cancers have been on the rise in the last
few years.

<P>
SINGAPORE, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Minister Tang
Jiaxuan and his Thai counterpart Surin Pitsuwan Sunday discussed
bilateral relations and the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF).
</P>
<P>
China attaches much importance to the role of Thailand, an
important member of ASEAN and who will hold the chairmanship of
the next ARF, in the regional grouping, Tang said.
</P>
<P>
China firmly supports ASEAN's lead role in the ARF and hopes
that the forum will maintain its efficient functional style and
stick to its nature as a political and diplomatic forum, said
Tang.
</P>
<P>
Tang emphasized that China attaches great importance to
President Jiang Zemin's coming state visit to Thailand.
</P>
<P>
China hopes that the visit will push Sino-Thai relations onto a
new level and lay a solid foundation for the development of
all-round friendly and long-term cooperation between the two
countries in the new century, said Tang.
</P>
<P>
He said China will make joint efforts with Thailand to ensure
the visit, which will have profound significance in the history of
Sino-Thai relations, a successful and fruitful one.
</P>
<P>
Surin said the Thai leaders and people are eagerly looking
forward to President Jiang's visit. The visit will become a
milestone in the two countries' ties, he said.
</P>
<P>
The development of a unique, fruitful and mutually beneficial
relationship between Thailand and China is not only in keeping

whole, Surin said.

<HEADLINE> Road Accidents Cause Heavy Losses in Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Traffic accidents claim thousands of
Egyptians' lives each year and inflict heavy economic losses on
the country, according to recent statistics.
</P>
<P>
The latest statistics published by Egypt's National Center for
Criminal and Sociological Research showed that 6,000 people die
and 30,000 others are injured in road accidents annually, the
Egyptian Gazette newspaper reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Egypt loses at least 3 billion Egyptian pounds (more than 880
million U.S. dollars) annually because of the road accidents, the
English-language paper said.
</P>
<P>
Reports about car collision and overthrow are common in Egypt.
They are mostly blamed on road conditions and failure of drivers
to abide by traffic rules and regulations.
</P>
<P>
It is widely accepted that most of Egypt's highways are poorly
lit, narrowly and badly paved. But security officials maintain
that the drivers are mainly responsible for most of the accidents.
</P>
<P>
Other statistics also blame 93 percent of the road accidents on
drivers and the other 7 percent on the vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian experts and media have called for tough measures,
including heavy penalties, to curb the surge of road accidents.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian President Flies to Rabat for Late King's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
left the country's Mediterranean port city of Alexandria on Sunday
for Rabat to attend the funeral of the late Moroccan King, Hassan
II, in the day.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak, who will join world leaders to mourn the death of King
Hassan II, is to offer condolences to King Hassan's eldest son and
the new Moroccan King, Mohamed VI, Egypt's Middle East News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Hassan, 70, who ruled the North African country for 38 years,
died Friday night of heart attack.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said on Saturday that he "felt great sorrow and grief
for the loss of a brother, dear friend and companion in the
struggle for Arab and Islamic causes."
</P>
<P>
Egypt announced Saturday three days of mourning for the death
of Hassan, during which the Egyptian national flags will be
lowered to half mast across the country and on the buildings of
its diplomatic missions abroad.
</P>
<P>
Also Sunday, Arab League Secretary General Esmat Abdel-Meguid
flew to Rabat for King Hassan's funeral.
</P>
<P>
King Hassan II helped Egypt and Israel reach peace agreements
in late 1970s, the first between an Arab country and the Jewish
state. He also mediated in the peace talks between the
Palestinians and Israel after the 1991 Madrid Mideast peace
conference.

<HEADLINE> Stepashin Favors Stable Ties With Washington </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Sergei
Stepashin said Sunday that Moscow's relations with Washington
should be "stable and not prone to changes due to considerations
of expediency."
</P>
<P>
Stepashin, currently attending Russian Navy Day celebrations in
the Far Eastern port city of Vladivostok, is scheduled to leave
for the United States late Sunday on a three-day visit.
</P>
<P>
"We would want our cooperation with the United States on the
entire range of issues concerning international and bilateral
relations to be stable and not prone to changes due to
considerations of expediency," Stepashin said in an interview with
the Itar-Tass news agency.
</P>
<P>
"We would like to see the obstacles that hamper its (bilateral
ties) deepening removed," he said.
</P>
<P>
Moscow's ties with Washington plunged to a record low when NATO
launched a 78-day air campaign against Yugoslavia on March 24.
</P>
<P>
Russia, which helped negotiate an end to the air raids, will
eventually send 3,600 troops to the Yugoslav province of Kosovo in
a peacekeeping mission alongside NATO forces.
</P>
<P>
"As the Kosovo crisis has shown once again, the general
situation in the world, the state of affairs in the field of
global security and stability and the resolution of many global
and regional problems facing the world community largely depend on
the degree of our cooperation," Stepashin said.
</P>
<P>
During the U.S. visit, Stepashin and U.S. Vice President Al
Gore are scheduled to hold talks as co-chairmen of the Russia-U.S.
Joint Commission on Economic and Technical Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Stepashin's predecessor, Yevgeny Primakov, canceled his trip to
the United States on March 23 when Gore refused to give him
assurance that NATO would not launch air strikes on Yugoslavia
during his tour.
</P>
<P>
But Stepashin's meeting with Gore will not be a full-scale
session of the bilateral commission. They will only discuss the
future work of the commission, Tass quoted U.S. Ambassador to
Russia James Collins as saying.
</P>
<P>
Stepashin said the two sides will "seek to broaden the
foundation of partnership in the 21st century."
</P>
<P>
He noted that "the reserve of strength created in Russian-U.S.
relations over the last years have prevented us from sliding into
confrontation and put the settlement of the Kosovo crisis on a
political footing, including by working with the United States.
</P>
<P>
However, "there is still hard work to do to solve the existing
problems and restore confidence undermined by NATO's military
action against Yugoslavia," Stepashin acknowledged.

JERUSALEM, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Prime Minister Ehud Barak's foreign policy adviser, Zvi
Stauber, said Saturday that Israel hopes negotiations with Syria
on a comprehensive peace deal between the two countries would
begin "within weeks."
</P>
<P>
He said the negotiations would resume from the point where they
broke off three years ago when hard-line former Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu took office, but each side could
interpret this point as they see fit.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>

informal face-to-face meeting between Israeli and Syrian delegates.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Dispute erupted in the parliament over a planned visit by
Palestinian Legislative Council Speaker Abu Ala Monday as guest of

honor guard, nor will he address the Knesset plenum.
</P>

Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- President Ezer Weizman, Prime Minister Barak, Regional

<HEADLINE> Iraq Accuses U.S., Britain of Delaying </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has accused the United States
and Britain for obstructing the contracts for Iraq's transport and
communications sector which it had signed under the oil-for-food
program, a daily newspaper reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Baghdad Observer quoted Minister of Transport and
Communications Ahmad Murtadha Ahmed as saying that "the U.S. and
British representatives in the U.N. Sanctions Committee are
hindering and delaying approval of contracts" his ministry signed
with foreign companies months ago.
</P>
<P>
The minister said they blocked contracts for the purchase of
spare parts to rehabilitate and reconstruct Iraq's war-battered
communications system.
</P>
<P>
Those contracts, according to the minister, meet a small part
of Iraq's actual needs for equipment, spare parts and replacement
parts for telephone exchanges destroyed during the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has allocated 92 million U.S. dollars for
Iraq's communications sector under the oil-for-food sector. Iraq
argues that the figure covers only 2 percent of its actual need.
</P>
<P>
The oil-for-food program, now in its sixth phase which started
on May 25, allows Iraq to export 5.2 billion dollars of oil in six
months to buy food, medicine and other humanitarian supplies for
its nearly 24 million people.
</P>
<P>
Under this program, Iraq signed a contract last December with a
French company for telephone and electronics worth 60 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
It also concluded last April a contract worth 38 million
dollars with a Chinese company to supply it with an exchange for
mobile phones, in addition to another contract worth 4 million
dollars with a Malaysian company to supply Iraq with micro
transmitters.
</P>
<P>
However, none of the above-mentioned contracts has been
approved by the U.N. Sanctions Committee.

<HEADLINE> New Group Formed to Fight AIDS in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian business fraternity has
 established a business coalition for a pro-active approach in the
fight against the HIV/AIDS scourge.
</P>
<P>
Zambian Sunday Mail newspaper reported that the World Health
Organization (WHO) and the UNAIDS, two United Nations wings on the
deadly disease, are concerned that despite the increase in
AIDS-related deaths of workers, major business organizations in
Zambia have not paid adequate attention to the problem.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted UNAIDS country representative Bernadette
Freers, who drafted the proposal for the involvement of the
business sector in HIV/AIDS activities, as saying that estimates
from UNAIDS and WHO have revealed that Africa has become the
global epicenter for HIV/AIDS pandemic and continued to dwarf the
rest of the world on the AIDS balance sheet.
</P>
<P>
The proposal on the coalition was endorsed at a meeting held in
Lusaka at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Participants were drawn from major business organizations
including Zambia Revenue Authority, BP Zambia, Zambia National
Commercial Bank, Barclays Bank and the Volunteer Service
Organization.
</P>
<P>
Participants agreed to establish a secretariat which will
support and facilitate the business coalition activities on
regular basis.
</P>
<P>
"The sheer number of Africans affected by the epidemic is
overwhelming. The southern part of the African continent holds the
majority of the world' s hard-hit countries with nearly 10,000 men
in sub-Saharan Africa becoming infected everyday," Freers said.
</P>
<P>
The business organizations pledged and assured the two UN wings
of their total commitment and support for the programs.
</P>
<P>
According to UNAIDS, the involvement of the business sector in
combating the HIV/AIDS pandemic has been a success in Thailand and
Uganda.

NAIROBI, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan Vice-President George
Saitoti has asked foreign businessmen in Kenya not to abuse the
hospitality accorded them by Kenyans.
</P>
<P>
The vice-president Saturday warned that the criminals among the
 businessmen should leave the country at once, local media
reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a bursary funds drive in Garissa District in North
Eastern Province, Saitoti said "we do not want international
criminals posing as businessmen to light up fires of controversy
in our country."
</P>
<P>
He also warned foreigners tarnishing the name of the Kenyan
president to stop it or risk deportation from the country.
</P>
<P>
Saitoti told the aliens to respect the head of state and stop
dragging his name into baseless allegations, saying foreigners
had stolen millions of shillings through corruption in the
country.
</P>
<P>
He decried the decay of moral value among foreigners, saying
that Kenyans highly regarded their leaders and expected the
aliens to do so while they are in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The vice-president also urged the Somali community in the
country to live in peace and appealed to the leaders of militia
factions in neighboring Somalia to find a peaceful settlement to
their differences.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines is eyeing the
establishment of new overseas-employment offices in Britain and
the Netherlands to seek jobs for Filipino nurses in the two
countries, a senior official said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In a report released here, Labor Secretary Bienvenido Laguesma
said that the opening of Philippine Overseas Labor Offices in the
two European countries was recommended by a Philippine mission,
which visited Europe recently.
</P>
<P>
The team held a consolidation meeting with Philippine embassy
officials on "procedures and guidelines for the recruitment and
employment of Filipino nurses" in the new labor markets, he said.
</P>
<P>
Laguesma said that the mission explored "prospects for Filipino
nurses in emerging markets like London and the Hague, capitals of
the two European countries, and negotiated for better employment
terms and conditions for Filipino nurses.
</P>
<P>
The team was informed of the increasing demand for foreign
nurses in the two countries and the expected demand for other
health personnel in the near future, the secretary said.
</P>
<P>
In the Netherlands, he said, the shortage of nursing personnel
had been so acute that some hospitals were forced to close some
wards.
</P>
<P>
At present, Saudi Arabia, Japan, the United Arab Emirates,
China's Hong Kong and Taiwan are the top destinations for overseas
Filipino workers, while Britain and the Netherlands are emerging
as new markets for Filipinos, according to the government.
</P>
<P>
There are over 4 million overseas Filipino workers working in
182 countries and regions in the world. They earn the country 6
billion U.S. dollars each year.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif has reiterated Pakistan's supported "One China" policy,
saying that "this is our principled stand".
</P>
<P>
In his letter addressed to Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji this
week, Sharif said, "we firmly believe that Taiwan is and will
remain an inalienable part of China and that it should return to
the motherland."
</P>
<P>
"No country has the right to interfere in the internal affairs
of China by encouraging Taiwan to assume sovereign statehood,"
said the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the latest statement by Taiwan leader Lee Teng-hui
that relations between Taiwan and the mainland should be treated
on "state-to-state" basis, Sharif said, Pakistan has been shocked
by this "untenable statement which seeks to give the impression
that Taiwan is a separate state.
</P>
<P>
"We condemn this statement," said Sharif.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan stands in full support and solidarity with China's
principled position on the Taiwan issue and the aspirations of the
Chinese people, Sharif said.
</P>
<P>
He said, "China has justifiably reacted to the Taiwanese
statement which we consider as highly irresponsible and in
defiance of the will of the Chinese people."
</P>
<P>
"Chinese sovereignty and territory are indivisible," Sharif
said, adding that the Pakistani government and people reiterate
"the unqualified endorsement and support to the One China policy."

<HEADLINE> Jordan Reduces Army Checkpoints to Promote Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, July 25 Xinhua) -- Jordan has removed most military
checkpoints in a key tourist highway and eased immigration
procedures at border posts to boost its tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
Only one military checkpoint remains for security reasons
along the scenic 320-kilometer Amman-Dead Sea-Aqaba Highway after
tourists complained of travel delays by military inspection at the
highway.
</P>
<P>
The highway was closed to the public during the years of
tensions with Israel but was opened in 1994 after Jordan signed a
peace agreement with the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian officials said check-in and departure procedures were
also eased at the Amman international airport and Jordanian-Saudi
border posts to help the inflow of foreign tourists.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian officials said current positive developments in the
Middle East peace process would reflect positively on the region's
politically-sensitive tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
Tourist arrivals in the kingdom increased by 15 percent during
the first six months of 1999, according the Tourism Ministry.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1.2 million tourists visited Jordan in 1998 and
brought the country 850 million U.S. dollars in foreign
currencies, the second largest revenue earner next to the mining
industry.

mark the Black July anniversary, officials said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Police and troops manning road blocks in the capital city and
suburbs as well as provincial towns had been put on maximum alert
with orders to step up searches for suicide bombers.
</P>
<P>
Around 3:30 a.m. Sunday a suicide bomber of the Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) rebels blasted a passenger vessel
anchored at the Trincomalee port, 257 kilometers northeast of
Colombo, Military spokesman Wadugodapitiya said.
</P>
<P>
The ship Newco Enduram owned by local Tamil businessmen was
badly damaged. The local people are badly affected in many ways,
specially the students, businessmen and officials, he said.
</P>
<P>
The ship has the capacity of accommodating 310 passengers and
was introduced by the government to offer better comfort and quick
travel, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
According to police sources, an electricity transformer was
blasted by a LTTE bomb Saturday night at Puththottam in the
northern Jaffna peninsula.
</P>
<P>
A number of villages in the area were affected due to the
blackout by the bomb blast.
</P>
<P>
Last week two civilians were killed and 17 wounded when a bomb
exploded near a police station in eastern Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
LTTE rebels have been fighting the Sri Lankan government for an
independent Tamil homeland in the north and east of the country
since the black July 1983 which witnessed bloody and violent
ethnic clashes between majority Sinhalese and minority Tamils.

Beijing, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Science books have become the best
sellers in China chiefly because of an essay item "If Memory Can
Be Transplanted" on this year's National Entrance Exam for
colleges and universities.
</P>
<P>
A set of science books "The World of Science Fiction for
Youngsters" published by the Guangxi Science and Technology
Publishing House was about to be returned to the publisher as it
wasn't selling very well, according to the director of the
Children's Department at the Xidan Book Store in downtown Beijing.
But, since the beginning of summer vacation, the books have become
increasingly more welcome and sold out within two days and the
store is now trying to order more.
</P>
<P>
Other science books are doing well also, according to the
director, and crowds of people are seen reading standing in front
of the science book shelf. Most of the customers are middle school
students, some of whom are accompanied by their parents.

<HEADLINE> Fate of U.S. Antidrug Plane Crew Kept Under Wrap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Colombian authorities
are searching for the seven occupants of a U.S. anti-drug plane
that crashed Friday in the Putumayo jungles in the south of the
country while on a secret mission.
</P>
<P>
Although some of the pilots who took part in the search of the
plane said they had seen it in the Putumayo (on the border with
Ecuador), the U.S. Embassy and the Colombian military authorities
were keeping complete silence about the fate of the aircraft and
its occupants.
</P>
<P>
Colombian Armed Forces Chief of Joint Staff General Rafael
Hernandez said the plane was located south of San Jose, in the
Guaviare department, the zone with the biggest plantations of
cocoa and opium poppy in the country, which has more than 50,000
hectares of illegal cultivation.
</P>
<P>
"The plane was destroyed and it is not officially known whether
its occupants are dead or not," said Hernandez, adding that the
causes of the accident were not yet known.
</P>
<P>
The sophisticated U.S. Army reconnaissance plane, with five
American soldiers and two Colombians aboard, went missing Friday
when it was on an anti-drug mission in Colombia, the U.S. military
said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Embassy said in a statement that contact had been lost
with the four- engine, de Havilland RC-7 plane during its early
morning flight.
</P>
<P>
U.S. army Capt. Chris Yates, a spokesman for the U.S. Southern
command in Miami, said the plane took off from a Colombian
military base near Apiay, 75 kilometers southeast of Bogota in a
mountainous region of the state of Meta.
</P>
<P>
He said "adverse weather conditions" including low-cloud cover
were registered there early Friday.
</P>
<P>
"It was a routine counter-drug mission gathering information to
support the Colombians in the counter-drug effort," Yates said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Embassy recently began sharing intelligence
information with Colombian military units which take part in anti-
narcotics operations.
</P>
<P>
The plane's disappearance comes on the eve of a visit to
Colombia by the U.S. National Drug Control Policy director Gen.
Barry McCaffrey, who is scheduled to arrive Sunday for a three-day
visit, that includes a tour of an army base where the U.S.
military is training and equipping a new 1,500-member army counter
narcotics battalion.
</P>
<P>
However, the Colombian newspaper El Espectador questioned why
there were more foreigners than Colombians in the operation, and
remembered that exactly three days ago U.S. President Bill Clinton
denied that his country plans to invade Colombia to combat the
guerrilla and drug traffickers.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Opposition Launches Road March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's opposition alliance
Sunday started their second road march this year to different
corners of the country to intensify the anti-government agitation.
</P>
<P>
The opposition alliance, comprising the major opposition - the
Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and the Jatiya Party (JP), the
Jamaat-e-Islami and the Islami Oikya Jote (IOJ), earlier announced
the program to protest what they said the ruling Awami League's
misrule, corruption, repression, killing of opposition activities
and police personnel, subservient foreign policy and activities
against national interests.
</P>
<P>
BNP Chairperson and Leader of the Opposition in Parliament
Khaleda Zia, JP Chairman H.M. Ershad, Jamaat Ameer Golam Azam and
IOJ chief Shaidul Hadis Moulana Azizul Huq were leading the
separate marches, also to protest the power crisis, deteriorating
law and order situation, and spiraling prices of essentials.
</P>
<P>
BNP policy-makers, who considered road march a powerful means
of mobilizing people's support in its anti-government movement
instead of going for frequent hartals (destructive strikes), began
its three-day march from Dhaka to northern Mymensingh district.
</P>
<P>
Zia, who was leading the BNP march from a bus stand at Uttara,
in the north of the capital city, would address 26 public meetings
in seven districts of greater Mymensingh and Gazipur.
</P>
<P>
The JP started its four-day "launch procession" from Dhaka to
Barisal, south Bangladesh, and its leaders would address 13 public
meetings and some roadside gatherings.
</P>
<P>
Jamaat would start a three-day roach march from Bogra district,
170 kilometers northwest of here, to the western district of
Chapainawabganj, and IOJ started its two-day march from the
capital to southeastern Chittagong district.
</P>
<P>
The alliance staged similar road marches in mid-May this year
to whip up a campaign against the government.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi President Visits No Foreign Country in Three Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi President Shahabuddin
Ahmed has not visited any foreign country during his nearly three
years in office although he has received a number of invitations,
The Daily Star reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Former South African President Nelson Mandela invited Ahmed
twice, first in March 1997 when Mandela visited Dhaka, and then in
June this year to attend the installation ceremony in which his
successor Thabo Mbeki took over. Foreign Minister Abdus Samad Azad
represented the president at the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladeshi president was also invited by Iranian President
Mohammad Khatami and Turkish President Suleyman Demeril.
</P>
<P>
Demeril invited Ahmed when the former visited Bangladesh along
with Mandela and Yasser Arafat in March 1997 to attend the Silver
Jubilee celebration of the country's independence. The Turkish
president renewed the invitation once again when he was here to
attend the Developing-Eight Conference in March this year.
</P>
<P>
Demeril later sent a fresh invitation to Ahmed to visit Turkey
and attend the celebrations marking the 75th founding anniversary
of the Turkey Republic in October this year. "We hope this time he
will be visiting Turkey in October or November," an official was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Asked if the president was reluctant to travel abroad or he had
to seek clearance from the prime minister, a presidential
spokesman said, "Only the president decides whether he would pay a
visit to a foreign country. He only needs to intimate his desire."
</P>
<P>
A Foreign Ministry official said, "We have to work out the
modalities of a presidential visit and know about the practice and
protocol after a decision is taken."
</P>
<P>
Senior officials at the Foreign Ministry felt that the
president should travel abroad at least occasionally, to give
Bangladesh an image-boosting opportunity, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Former President Abdur Rahman Biswas, during his five-year
tenure, paid an official visit to Britain only, to attend
celebrations marking the 50th anniversary of Victory in Europe,
according to the report.

STOCKHOLM, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Sweden claimed 169 out of the

<HEADLINE> Salaries for Public Sector To Go Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government is
considering to raise the salaries of public servants and employees
of government-sponsored institution, according to today's China
Daily Business Weekly.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the paper quoted signed articles by Zeng Peiyan,
minister of the State Development Planning Commission, and Finance
Minister Xiang Huaicheng as saying that enterprises will be
allowed to pay their employees according to their business
performance.
</P>
<P>
Rising salaries will raise production costs, limiting
enterprises' room for further price cuts, the paper noted.
</P>
<P>
The retail price index has been falling for 21 months in a row.
It fell 3.2 percent in the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
This would be a good way to offset the mounting deflationary
pressure as more currency will go into circulation, said a
researcher at China Securities Co. Ltd.
</P>
<P>
He added that the excessive supply in the market would not be
overcome as people would not use all their new income for spending.
</P>
<P>
"As long as the supply remains larger than the demand, there is
no way skyrocketing inflation will return," said Zhang Xueying, a
researcher at the State Information Center.
</P>
<P>
China's fiscal strength was sufficient to pay for the rises in
income, said Zhang, who suggested that the government could adjust
its expenditure structure to cover the money used for the salary
rises. For example, the construction of some infrastructure
projects could be postponed.
</P>
<P>
And the rise in production costs would not result in weakened
competitiveness of Chinese products, he said, as the salaries of
Chinese workers would still be low compared with the United States.
In 1997, the average per-hour payment to Chinese workers was only
three yuan as compared with 11 U.S. dollars in the United States.

<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, July 25 (Xinhua) -- More than 200 military maps used
by invading Japanese troops during the War of Resistance to Japan
(1937-45) have been found in an archival collection in Changzi
County of north China's Shanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
This is the largest number of these kinds of maps ever
discovered in one place. They are expected to be valuable for the
study of the intruding Japanese troops' movements in northern
China during the war.
</P>
<P>
The maps are drawn on a scale of 1:50,000 and 1:100,000 and

CARACAS, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Around 73 percent of the
Venezuelans interviewed support President Hugo Chavez, shows a
recent poll conducted by the "Consultores 21" polling firm between
July 7 and 15 in five major cities of the country.

The polling shows that Venezuelans maintain their confidence in
the president, despite their admission that the problems directly
affecting them have worsened in the last few months.
</P>
<P>
The biggest concern of the people surveyed is unemployment,
while Chaves won most credit for freedom of speech, education,
control of government corruption and the health program.

one point to finish 15th in the 6th World Men's Junior Basketball
Championship here on Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Banks Forced to Go Marketing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Growing competition is obliging
Chinese banks to pay more attention to marketing.
</P>
<P>
TV commercials, newspaper advertisements and street promotion
activities, which were only used by manufacture firms, have
adopted by Chinese banks.
</P>
<P>
Buses carrying bank advertisements are common sights in the
downtown areas of major cities. Bank sponsor TV shows and
brochures and umbrellas are handed out to customers for free.
</P>
<P>
Under the planned economy, China's four specialized banks were
limited to different business areas. But with the country's
banking reform going deeper and the four specialized banks
transforming into commercial banks, the boundaries have been
broken.
</P>
<P>
Going out on the streets is another important part of the
marketing strategy for Chinese banks.
</P>
<P>
When a new product is released, bank employees usually set up
stands in the streets to popularize the new service.
</P>
<P>
Employees are also sent out to enterprises, institutions and
universities to seek customers.

<P>
Clinton sent this signal in a letter to his Albanian
counterpart Rexhep Mejdani.
</P>
<P>
A summit meeting is to be held next week in Sarajevo, capital

<P>
Clinton expressed hopes in his letter that Albania and its
neighboring countries can cooperate with each other to outline
plans to advance this goal, according to the Albanian Telegraphic
Agency (ATA)
</P>
<P>
Clinton also urged Mejdani to present proposals to achieve long-
term growth and stability, to address market reforms,
democratization and regional security.
</P>
<P>
Clinton hoped that Albania can make every effort to help refine
such plans for presentation at the summit at the preparatory
meetings in Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
The Summit of the Stability Pact for Southeastern Europe
reportedly is to take place in Sarajavo during July 29-30 under
the auspices of the European Union. It is designed to launch a

<HEADLINE> Vestiges of Arawuaca Culture Found in Cuba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The finding of more than 50
archeological sites with Arawuaca Indians' traditional instruments
show that those aboriginal people inhabited Cuba in the 15th
century, before the Caribe indigenous people.
</P>
<P>
The Cuban press reported Saturday that those sites were
discovered in caves, on land, islets and mountains, located in the
north of the central province of Sancti Spiritus.
</P>
<P>
It is the same area where in a smaller land extension the
vestiges show an amalgamation of cultures, such as those of the
Paleolithic with the early, medium and late Mesolithic, and also
with the early and late Neolithic, but with a predominance of the
Arawuaca.
</P>
<P>
Classified by experts as migrants and known as fearful warriors,
the Arawuaca, who came from the Orinoco River watershed, were one
of the indigenous peoples who occupied the Minor Antilles.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Highlights of today's major
Beijing-based newspapers:
</P>
<P>
Today's major newspapers, some devote their entire pages to a
wide coverage to the positive attitude of Chinese people from all
walks of life toward the ban of Falun Gong, or the wheel of law,
an illegal organization masterminded by Li Hongzhi.
</P>
<P>
People's Daily
</P>
<P>
-- All members of the Communist Party of China (CPC), government
officials and the people across the country extend their firm
support for the central government's decision on outlawing Falun
Gong, and cited it as a sinister organization that spreads
malicious fallacies detrimental to both the soul and bodies of the
people.
</P>
<P>
This constitutes a serious ideological and political struggle,
which has a bearing on the fundamental belief of the CPC members,
on the basic ideological basis for the Chinese people's cause and
unity, as well as on the future and destiny of the Party and State.
</P>
<P>
-- Following the imposition by the Chinese authorities of a ban
Thursday on Falun Gong, officers and men of the People's
Liberation Army (PLA) and the armed police forces have hailed the
ban as "a wise and resolute decision" and pledge themselves to
render their all-out support.
</P>
<P>
"In the past few days, all men and officers of the PLA and the
armed police forces have delved into a series of important
speeches made by President Jiang Zemin and materials prepared to
expose the true feature of Falun Gong, so as to unify their
thinking and further increase their ideological consciousness,"
said a senior officer with the PLA General Political Department.
</P>
<P>
 Xinhua Daily Telegraph
</P>
<P>
-- At a forum held by the Chinese Communist Youth League
Central Committee Friday in Beijing, participants unanimously
agreed that the CPC Central Committee's decision to resolve the
Falun Gong issue according to law reflected the common aspiration
of the overwhelming majority of Party members and the common
people.
</P>
<P>
-- The members of the National Committee of the Chinese People'
s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), the country's highest
advisory body, expressed their support to China's policy decision
to ban Falun Gong.
</P>
<P>
At a forum called by the CPPCC National Committee, members of
the CPPCC National Committee and of its standing committee held
that the decision made by the CPC Central Committee conformed the
will and determination of the people.
</P>
<P>
The decision is of far-reaching significance for maintaining
social and political stability and ensuring the healthy
development of the reform and opening-up, and socialist
modernization drive, they said.
</P>
<P>
 China Daily (Business Weekly)
</P>
<P>
-- Nuclear technology is playing a role in enhancing
agricultural production in China. "Pressed by its mounting
population, China is resorting to high and new technologies,
especially bio-engineering, to boost grain output," said Zhu Jiang,
an expert with the China Atomic Energy Authority.
</P>
<P>
-- Relevant statisticians available from the State Statistical
Bureau indicate that it is unlikely the upcoming autumn harvest
will be bigger than last year's.
</P>
<P>
The reason was not clear why accurate statistics about the
grain yields in 1998 had not been released, sources noted. But the
yields could top an unprecedented high of 500 million tons despite
a drop of 4.45 million tons in the summer harvests and the ensuing
severe autumn floods last year.

<HEADLINE> Venezuelan President Concerned over U.S. Oil-Dumping Charge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez
expressed his concern Saturday over a lawsuit filed by a group of
small U.S. oil producers about alleged unfair practices in
Venezuelan and Mexican oil prices.
</P>
<P>
In his letter to U.S. President Bill Clinton, published by the
Presidency of the Republic, Chavez called on Clinton's attention
to the matter, considered to be "of utmost importance" for
Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
The Save Domestic Oil group, that includes small U.S. oil
producers, filed last month a denunciation against Mexico,
Venezuela and Saudi Arabia, alleging that they are implementing a
"dumping" strategy of exporting oil under production cost to
squeeze out small U.S. crude producers.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Department of Energy said Friday that the denunciation
of unfair competition against Mexico and Venezuela "seems not to
have a consistent support" from the industry.
</P>
<P>
Chavez said in his letter that "the Venezuelan oil industry
shares the same interests" with the U.S. and the allegations
reflected "a wrong interpretation of the way the international oil
market operates" and produced "a serious instability" in it.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said Friday that he
feared that the denunciation "might imperil" the good relations of
the United States with the two crude-producing Latin American
countries and could bring negative effects upon U.S. investments
in that sector.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Commerce must decide on August 9 about this
lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
The countries implied in the lawsuit, members of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), with the
exception of Mexico, consider that the denunciation will not
advance, since it is necessary to prove that 25 percent of
internal production is being affected by the "dumping" action.

<HEADLINE> Mental Training Supports Physical Condition, Says Expert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Physical training with the most
advanced equipment and best programs will be useless if coaches
and sports organization officials do not pay attention to athletes
' psychological condition, an Indonesian sports psychologist said.
</P>
<P>
"Mental training in sports must be considered as important as
physical training," said Singgih Gunarsa, a professor of sports
psychology at the University of Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a sports psychology symposium here on Saturday,
Singgih said the mental training plan -- short-term and long-term
training -- must be in accordance with the athletes' targets.
</P>
<P>
The mental training plan must also adjust to athletes'
personality profiles and sports, he said, adding that the mental
training for archers would be completely different from boxers.
</P>
<P>
The training will cover self-confidence in athletes, especially
when competing in a team event in which all team members have
equal responsibility and can contribute equally to win the match.
</P>
<P>
Athletes were also urged to mentally face the possibility of
being badly injured in a tournament. The visualization would help
athletes overcome their fear of being injured.
</P>
<P>
Mental training would improve an athlete's performance, power
and physical condition, Singgih was quoted by The Jakarta Post
Sunday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Singgih said psychology, as the science of human's attitudes,
has proved to be reliable in improving athletes' performances and
qualities.
</P>
<P>
Sports psychology is the study of how psychological factors
influence an athlete's physical ability and also how a person's
involvement in sports influences his or her personality.
</P>
<P>
The living example of this is badminton star Mia Audina, the
paper quoted sports observers as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Olympics silver medalist's performance has been decreasing
in the last year due to her marriage with Surinamese Tylio Lobman,
which was opposed by father Rivan Tjiptawan and her mother's death.
</P>
<P>
Mia, 19, who sparked controversy with her statement that she
was abused as a child, is still Indonesia's best hope for the
Sydney Olympics next year, despite tougher competition in the
women's singles.
</P>
<P>
At the symposium, Singgih received an award from the Sports
Psychology Association for his contribution to the development of
sports psychology in Indonesia.

<P>
BEIJING, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Nuclear technology is playing an
increasing role in enhancing agricultural production in China.
</P>
<P>
"Pressed by its vast population, China is resorting to high
and new technologies, especially bio-engineering, to boost grain
output," said Zhu Jiang, an expert with the China Atomic Energy
Authority (CAEA).
</P>
<P>
Application of isotopes and radiation in agriculture can help
develop new varieties, promote crop and livestock production,
enhance the quality, safety and security of food, and minimize
pollution.
</P>
<P>
CAEA Chairman Zhang Huazhu said the government attaches great
importance to the application of nuclear energy in breeding,
tracing, food preservation and the improvement of the environment,
and encourages further work on the combination of nuclear
technology and bio-technology, transgenetic technology and space
breeding.
</P>
<P>
To date, 513 new varieties of more than 40 plants have been
bred by irradiation or in combination with other techniques in
China, accounting of one-fourth of the world's total.
</P>
<P>
These new varieties have helped increase production of food
grain, cotton and oil-bearing crops by three to four million tons
per year with annual economic benefits valued at about 3.3 billion
yuan (about 400 million U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> Chile's Economic Activity Registers Worst Drop Since 1983 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Chile's economic activity dropped
3.1 percent in the first five months of the year, the biggest
decline since 1983, when it plunged 6.83 percent, the Central Bank
announced Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Economic Activity Index (Imacec) issued by the Central Bank
shows that the steepest fall occurred in April, when it fell 6
percent from the same period of 1998.
</P>
<P>
The bank blamed the plummet on the country's adjustment policy
introduced last year, lower prices of exports in the
international markets and the drought in recent months.
</P>
<P>
Central Bank studies manager Felipe Morandi forecast that
economic activity will also drop in July, but he expects positive
figures after August or September.
</P>
<P>
Economic authorities forecast that gross domestic product (GDP)
will grow only 0.5 percent this year, far less than the 3.4
percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
To reactivate the country's economy, the Chilean government has
announced a series of measures, including incentives for the
construction and acquisition of houses, rescheduling of credits to
small and medium entrepreneurs, an employment-promoting program,
and subsidies to the poorer sectors of the country.
</P>
<P>
Chilean President Eduardo Frei expressed his confidence on
Friday that the steps will yield expected results.

<P>
PARIS, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Lance Armstrong of the United States
won the 19th and penultimate stage of the Tour de France on
Saturday, closing his triumph in the famed drug-tarnished cycling
race.
</P>
<P>
The American savored his third straight time trial victory, by
clocking a time of one hour eight minutes 17 seconds over the 57
kilometer course, nine seconds ahead of Alex Zulle of Switzerland,
who leapt to second place in the overall standings.
</P>
<P>
With the win, Armstrong has improved to a now almost unbeatable
seven minutes 37 seconds over Zulle.
</P>
<P>
His compatriot Tyler Hamilton ended the stage in third place by
a margin of one minute 35 seconds.
</P>
<P>
With just one stage to go, a 143.5 kilometer stage from Arpajon
to Paris, it seems that Armstrong has now sealed victory.
</P>
<P>
Armstrong looked in command on Saturday by completing the first
28 kilometers of the course in 35 minutes 34 seconds for an edge
of 21 seconds over Zulle, who was in second, and was the only
rider able to keep the pace with Armstrong.
</P>
<P>
However, as Armstrong had already enjoyed more than six minutes
ahead in the standings before the start of the stage, the real
battle was for the podium placings and Zulle's performance meant
he leapfrogged Escartin into second place.
</P>
<P>
The penultimate stage of the three-week long race was flat,
with a 550-meter straight at the finish.

<HEADLINE> China's Autumn Harvest Likely to Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 25 (Xinhua) -- First-hand information from farms
nationwide is convincing statisticians at the State Statistical
Bureau (SSB) that it is unlikely the approaching autumn harvest
will be bigger than last year's.
</P>
<P>
Sources said that the reason was not clear why the government
had not yet released accurate statistics about the grain yields in
1998, but the yields could hit an unprecedented high of over 500
million tons despite a drop of 4.45 million tons in the summer
harvests and the severe flooding disaster in autumn last year.
</P>
<P>
"This year it is very difficult for the grain yields to surpass
last year's level. Grain cultivation has shrunk by 780,000
hectares nationwide in 1999, Xian Zude, deputy director-general of
the SSB's Rural Survey Organization, was quoted by today's China
Daily as saying.
</P>
<P>
The current oversupply of spring wheat in the north, wheat
grown south of the Yangtze River, and low-grade early rice in
particular has dampened farmers' enthusiasm to produce more. They
are also disheartened by the fact that the State purchase prices
for such cereals for the first time fell below the average price
offered for this summers' grain.
</P>
<P>
The price of crops are also dropping on the domestic market
after several consecutive years of bumper harvests, Xian said.
</P>
<P>
During the first six months of this year, farmers' income
increased 2.1 percent to 998 yuan (120 U.S.dollars). Taking
inflation into account, the real increase of their income in the
period was 4.7 percent, the same as the rise in this summer's
grain harvest, which reached 118.5 million tons.

<HEADLINE> No Foreign Intervention in Domestic Affairs: Colombian President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Colombian President
Andres Pastrana said Saturday that he would not permit or accept
any foreign intervention in his nation's domestic affairs.
</P>
<P>
At a ceremony of the Naval Force at the Bahia Malaga base, on
the Pacific, Pastrana said that Colombia is not, and would never
be, "an international threat" and its military forces "are fully
capable and prepared to defend national sovereignty and democracy.
"
</P>
<P>
The president stressed that all those regarding Colombia as a
country without security are wrong, although he admitted that the
main challenge is to resolve the internal armed conflicts.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton on Thursday sent Pastrana a letter
assuring him that his country will not intervene in the conflicts
of the South American country, in view of speculations of a
possible U.S. military intervention to combat the guerrilla.
</P>
<P>
Colombian Armed Forces Commander Fernando Tapias also denied
the existence of an alternative plan for the United States to
attack the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC)
guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Colombian guerrilla leader Lius Egard Devia, also known as "
Raul Reyes," earlier alleged that the government armed forces have
a "Plan B," which calls for support of the United States to
suppress the guerrilla in case the peace process fails.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 25 (Xinhua) -- China's insurance companies may
now invest two percent of their assets into corporate bonds, today
's China Daily business weekly reported.
</P>
<P>
The green light was given early in May. The State Council,
China's highest administrative body, has in principle approved
insurance companies to invest in corporate bonds. But the
permitted investment volume was revealed only recently.
</P>
<P>
According to regulations set by the China Insurance Regulatory
Commission (CIRC), insurance companies can spend no more than two
percent of their total assets on State-level corporate bonds. Each
purchase should not exceed 10 percent of the bonds issued at any
given time.
</P>
<P>
Previously, life insurers could only invest their premium
income in bank deposits and government bonds.
</P>
<P>
Since 1996, the one-year fixed bank savings interest rate in
China has dropped from 10 percent to 2.25 percent. Insurance firms
have accumulated several dozen billion yuan worth of policies with
nominal rates higher than eight percent.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Routs Germany in Confederation Cup Opener </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, July 24 (Xinhua) -- After a highly defensive first
half, the Brazilians scored four goals against nil to stun their
German peers in the opener of the FIFA Confederations Cup in
Guadalajara, Mexico on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In the first half, the Brazilians dominated the ball but failed
to score as forwards Ronaldinho and Christian repeatedly got
tripped up in the penalty box.
</P>
<P>
However, the second half was another story as "we started out
more rested and we took advantage of the Germans' weariness," said
coach Wanderley Luxemburgo.
</P>
<P>
In the 16th minute of the second half, Ze Roberto beat goalie
Jens Lehmann to score the first goal off a pass from off-balanced
Ronaldinho who netted in the second from the penalty 10 minutes
later by tapping in the rebound.
</P>
<P>
In the last five minutes, Alex scored twice to put the
Brazilians into an unbeatable lead, including a solo run in the
43rd minute up from the middle.
</P>
<P>
Germany had few scoring opportunities, and most were shot wide
with its best opportunity came in the 39th minute of the first
half when a long shot bounced off the hands of Brazilian goalie
Dida.
</P>
<P>
The game was depicted in a rather rough manner with three
yellow cards fished out in the first half as both soccer
powerhouses dispatched their younger generations.
</P>
<P>
The Confederation Cup features eight squads in two groups, with
top two teams of each group advancing to the semifinals.

MEXICO CITY, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Brian McBride and Jovan
Kirovski each netted in a goal to put the United States for a 2-1
victory over New Zealand in the Confederations Cup soccer
tournament here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Americans opened their account in the 25th minute when
McBride netted in a pass by swinging his head neatly, and surged
ahead with 12 minutes into the second half as Kirovski headed in a
corner kick past New Zealand goalie Michael Utting.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand only managed for a late goal on a free kick in the
final minute of the game when Chris Zoricich fired into the net.
</P>
<P>
However, the crowd clearly favored New Zealand by booing every
time the U.S. got the ball and roaring when New Zealand made a
drive.
</P>
<P>
And many audience left the 58,000-seat Jalisco Stadium after
Brazil outscored Germany 4-0 in the opener of the soccer

<HEADLINE> Hebei Province Fights Desertification </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Hebei, the north China
province that surrounds Beijing, has scored some success in its
decades-old drive to deal with desertification.
</P>
<P>
The province has so far reclaimed 230,000 ha of desertified
land and controlled desertification in an area of nearly one
million ha, greatly improving its environment as well as the
environment of the adjacent Beijing and Tianjin municipalities.
</P>
<P>
Hebei is one of the regions in China which suffered most
seriously from desertification, with a desertified area of 1.71
million ha and about one tenth of the land in the province
affected by desertification to varying degrees. In some areas,
desertification is expanding at an annual rate of over four
percent.
</P>
<P>
To curb environmental degradation, Hebei has stepped up its
efforts in afforestation and sand control, combined with poverty-
relief steps. A total of 112.6 million yuan (13.6 million US
dollars) has been put into the projects aimed at battling
desertification so far.
</P>
<P>
Besides improving the environment, the sand-control projects
also help locals to earn more money by growing fruit and timber,
or developing tourism on reclaimed land.

<HEADLINE> Argentina Rules Out U.S. Intervention in Colombia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Argentine President Carlos
Menem said here Saturday that it would be inappropriate for the
United States to intervene militarily in Colombia's combat against
the guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Menem told Radio National that there is no possibility for an
intervention unless the Colombian government itself requests
foreign assistance, cooperation or some kind of intervention.
</P>
<P>
The Argentine president said that the situation in Colombia is
grave as clashes between government troops and the Revolutionary
Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) near Bogota, the capital of the
country, could destabilize all the Latin American region.
</P>
<P>
Peace negotiations between the government and FARC, the biggest
guerrilla group in Colombia, suffered a setback last month as the
most serious crossfire between both sides for many years broke out
near Bogota, killing hundreds of people.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to Peru on Friday Brazilian President Fernando
Henrique Cardoso and his Peruvian counterpart Alberto Fujimori
also rejected an eventual foreign military intervention in
Colombia, considering such a move as an intervention in the
domestic affairs of a nation.

HANOI, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam is to send a delegation of
243 members, including 171 athletes, to the 20th Southeast Asian
Games (SEA Games) to be started on August 7 in Brunei, Vietnam's
official news agency VNA reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese athletes will compete in 14 sports of the track
and field, cycling, swimming, taekwondo, karatedo, pencak silat,
table tennis, billiard, tennis, badminton, soccer, bowling, golf
and clay pigeon shooting.
</P>
<P>
Bowling, golf and clay pigeon shooting are the events that
Vietnam is competing internationally for the first time.
</P>
<P>
The biggest teams are for the track-and-field events with 28
athletes, followed by pencak silat with 22, as both karatedo and
soccer with 20 apiece.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam, VNA said, expects to win between 12 and 15 golds and
stand at the fifth or sixth position at the games, after Brunei
organizers cut several key sports from the games, which include
wushu, wrestling and shooting, that Vietnam is traditionally
strong in.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnam Olympics Committee will give cash incentives for
medalists at the games. Gold medalists will receive 300 U.S.
dollars while silver and bronze winners will pick up 200 and 100
dollars respectively.
</P>
<P>
In addition, they will receive 15 million Vietnamese dong (
about 1,080 U.S. dollars), 10 million Vietnamrse dong (about 718
dollars) and 7 million Vietnamese dong (about 503 dollars) for the
top three finishes respectively.
</P>
<P>
At the previous SEA Games in Indonesia in 1997, Vietnam, with
320 athletes competing in 24 out of 34 sports, won 133 medals
including 35 golds for the fifth spot.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Criticizes Republican Tax-cut Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 24 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said Saturday the Republicans' 10-year, 792-billion-dollar tax-cut
plan would "imperil the future stability of the country."
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't make sense," Clinton said on his weekly radio
address, asserting that the Republican program would soak up money
needed for Social Security, Medicare and other social programs.
</P>
<P>
The Republicans were engaged in a childish tax-cut bidding war,
he added.
</P>
<P>
"It's almost like the arguments we used to have when I was at
school," the president said.
</P>
<P>
"Their reckless tax plan would threaten law enforcement across
the board, forcing reductions in the number of federal agents and
cutting deeply into support for state and local law enforcement,"
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
However, a top Republican official praised the 792 billion
dollars tax cut plan as returning surplus federal money to the
people to keep it from being spent in Washington.
</P>
<P>
The Republican plan helps fix an unfair tax system by making it
financially easier to get married and save money for children's
education or other long-term needs, House Majority Leader Dick
Armey said on the Republicans' own radio address.
</P>
<P>
The plan would ease taxation on interest accrued from savings
and reduce the "marriage penalty," Armey said.
</P>
<P>
"The prosperity you created brought us the first budget surplus
in 39 years," he said. "We must return that money to you so it
isn't spent in Washington on more big government."
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that the U.S. will have a budget surplus of 2.9
trillion dollars over the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
The Democratic Party and the White House want to spend the
surplus on social programs such as Social Security and Medicare
while the Republicans want to return money to the taxpayers by
cutting tax.
</P>
<P>
In an almost straight party-line vote Thursday, the House of
Representatives approved a bill that would cut 792 billion dollar
taxes over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
The bill now goes to the Senate, which is also planning to pass
a tax cut bill next week that is the same size as the House bill
but differs in detail.
</P>
<P>
Clinton has threatened to veto such deep cuts and instead
favors a tax cut in the range of 250 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Stepashin Not to Run for Russian Presidency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Sergei
Stepashin said Saturday that he is not going to run for president
in the upcoming race for the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
"This is not part of my plans," Stepashin said in the Russian
Pacific port of Vladivostok, where he was on a business mission,
the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The denial came after the rise of his approval rate among
Russians.
</P>
<P>
According to a poll taken by the Public Opinion Foundation on
July 10, 39 percent of 1,500 people surveyed have a good
impression of Stepashin, up from 30 percent in May 29.
</P>

Stepashin also denied the assertions that Russia may turn the
four Kuril Islands over to Japan.
</P>
<P>
"Undoubtedly, this won't be," Stepashin said.

<P>
While in Vladivostok, Stepashin will meet with the Pacific
Fleet chiefs and will take part in festivities marking the Russian
Navy Day.

<HEADLINE> Primakov Fit for Politics, Undecided on Parliamentary Polls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Former Russian Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov said he is fit to pursue politics but has not
made up his mind whether to run in the parliamentary elections
later this year.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the TV Center television channel, which
was broadcast Saturday evening, Primakov said the question on
parliamentary poll remains "in the reflective stage."
</P>
<P>
He called for rallying "the center's robust forces" together as
"the nucleus that will help to reform the country and overcome a
great many difficulties, which we are going through now."
</P>
<P>
Primakov expressed satisfaction over his high approval rate in
opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
"If this rating really mirrors the real picture, and I hope it
does, naturally, I am pleased to see a great many people trusting
me," he said.
</P>
<P>
Primakov said he is fit enough to pursue political activities,
and added that the recent surgery in Switzerland on a pelvis joint
"was not bad."
</P>
<P>
"All pains stopped right after the surgery. With every passing
day, I feel better," Primakov said.
</P>
<P>
"On the whole, I am very pleased that I was operated on because
that has lifted virtually all health problems that I'd had. There
I was thoroughly examined, and everything went smoothly," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the upcoming presidential race, Primakov expressed the hope
that the next president will be "undoubtedly strong, but acting
only under the protection of law, giving all his strength and
experience to serving the people, solving the tasks of improving
the people's standard of living, advancing Russia, uniting Russia,
and... preserving Russia as a great power."
</P>
<P>
Primakov, who took office as prime minister on September 11
last year, was fired by President Boris Yeltsin on May 12 for
"failing to carry out strategic tasks."
</P>
<P>
Saturday's interview was his first given to Russian TV since
the dismissal.
