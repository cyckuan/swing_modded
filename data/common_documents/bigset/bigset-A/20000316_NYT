   PORT CHARLOTTE, Fla. _ Four Rangers pitchers combined to shut
out Baltimore yesterday, the latest in a series of pitching
performances that have helped pull this camp out of an early
malaise.
</P>
<P>
   Darren Oliver, Jeff Zimmerman, Ryan Glynn and Joaquin Benoit
combined on a three-hitter as the Rangers beat the Orioles, 2-0,
for their third consecutive victory after a 3-7 start.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers have given up three runs in those three victories.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing how your emotions can go up and down,'' manager
Johnny Oates said. ``Three days ago, I wasn't very happy. We
weren't throwing strikes, and we were making errors. Now we're the
best thing since sliced bread.''
</P>
<P>
   Darren Oliver pitched 41/3 hitless innings, indicating again
that the Rangers' starting pitching has been one of the best things
about the camp. The Rangers' starting five of Oliver, Kenny Rogers,
Rick Helling, Esteban Loaiza and Mark Clark has a combined
earned-run average of 2.63.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to see,'' first baseman Rafael Palmeiro said. ``It
gives you confidence when you have guys who can shut down the other
team like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitching coach Dick Bosman said: ``I like the attitude, and I
like the way they're throwing the ball over \Rthe plate\S. The
attitude is one of aggression. We're good, let's be good, let's act
like it, and let's perform like it.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, as good as the pitching has been, three nagging injuries
and three other issues need to be addressed before the Rangers
break camp in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The injuries of most concern are to relievers John Wetteland and
Mike Venafro, and outfielder Rusty Greer. Wetteland (strained
groin) and Venafro (strained ligament on his left middle finger)
have not pitched in an intrasquad game, and Greer (inflamed right
ankle) has been limited to 14 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   Trainer Danny Wheat said Wetteland is improving but said,
``We're going to take an extra day or two just to be on the safe
side.''
</P>
<P>
   Greer is expected to return to the lineup Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Venafro has not even pitched batting practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I think about it, but I'm not worried about it,'' Oates
said. ``You want everybody healthy and throwing, but it takes
somebody better than I am. The trainers are working hard, and the
\Rplayers\S are working hard. Everybody has to deal with those
things.''
</P>
<P>
   Oates listed three major issues to be decided before the end of
camp: third base, second base and the batting order.
</P>
<P>
   Third base is up in the air between rookies Mike Lamb and Tom
Evans.
</P>
<P>
   Second base is Luis Alicea's job, but Frank Catalanotto is
bidding for more playing time with his spring performance.
Catalanotto is hitting .438 with two home runs; Alicea went 0-for-3
yesterday and is hitting .182.
</P>
<P>
   ``Luis is going to get a shot,'' Oates said. ``But if Luis
doesn't hit, Catalanotto will play second base. If Luis hits, we'll
find other places for Catalanotto to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Initial reports on Catalanotto included concern about his
defense. But Oates said: ``If Catalanotto is playing second base,
his defense will be fine. I don't think defense will keep him from
playing second.'' nn

PORT AUTHORITY CHIEF IS ACCUSED OF FRAUD IN REAL ESTATE DEAL
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The state attorney general Wednesday accused the
chief of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, a longtime
friend and fund-raiser to Gov. George Pataki, of fraud and other
misdeeds in a real estate deal, and state officials say he will
soon leave the authority because of the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Eliot Spitzer filed a civil lawsuit Wednesday
in state Supreme Court in Manhattan, contending that the
authority's executive director, Robert E. Boyle, 63, had illegally
profited in the early 1990s from real estate transactions with
Hudson Valley Hospital Center in Peekskill, where he was chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Boyle, a former head of the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center,
becomes the closest person to the governor, and the first
high-ranking member of his administration, to be tainted by
scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki, then a state assemblyman, served on the hospital's board
at Boyle's invitation from 1988 to 1992. There has been no
suggestion that Pataki was involved in, or knew of, any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   The case against Boyle stemmed from the federal tax-fraud
indictment more than a year ago against Albert J. Pirro Jr., a
prominent lobbyist and real estate lawyer, and the husband of
Jeanine F. Pirro, the Westchester County district attorney, another
close friend and ally of the governor's.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment described a real estate deal that Boyle and Pirro
entered into with the hospital, though Spitzer's suit says that
Boyle's role in that deal was hidden.
</P>
<P>
   Pirro's indictment prompted Spitzer's investigation of Boyle,
which was kept secret until Wednesday. The attorney general decided
not to seek criminal charges against Boyle, but is seeking more
than $500,000 in restitution to the hospital under the civil
action.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer's suit contends that Boyle defrauded the hospital and
its parent company, Westchester-Putnam Health Management System
Inc., by hiding his role, and accuses him of many violations of the
state's laws against self-dealing by the officers of a
not-for-profit corporation. It also says that his lies led the
hospital and the parent company to file false statements in their
annual reports.
</P>
<P>
   State prosecutors and administration officials said they
expected Boyle to leave the Port Authority because of the
accusations. He will either resign, they said, or simply not seek
reappointment by the governor when his term expires in April.
</P>
<P>
   Boyle's lawyer, Andrew J. Levander, released a statement
Wednesday saying that the suit was ``based on tired, inaccurate and
invalid allegations relating to events nearly 10 years ago.'' It
added, ``Mr. Boyle intends to move to dismiss this lawsuit in its
entirety.''
</P>
<P>
   Boyle's departure from the Port Authority would complicate
matters at an agency that has been paralyzed by a running dispute
between Pataki and Gov. Christie Whitman of New Jersey over how to
divide its resources between the two states. For more than a year,
that feud has held up approval of a crucial contract with the
country's two largest shipping companies.

FIFTH REPUBLICAN ENTERS RACE FOR THE U.S. SENATE
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By DAVID M. HALBFINGER  
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORTH ARLINGTON, N.J. _ State Sen. William L. Gormley, who has
been seeking higher office for more than a decade, officially
entered the race Wednesday for the Republican nomination for the
U.S. Senate, saying his reputation for integrity and his record as
a tax cutter would win over voters.
</P>
<P>
   In a minibus tour from his hometown, Margate, on the Jersey
Shore, to Republican-rich suburbs to the north, Gormley, a
53-year-old former Marine captain, made character a central issue.
He described himself as a hardball fighter for his constituents who
was unafraid to take difficult stands, no matter the consequences.
``On matters of principle I will not waver,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gormley is the fifth Republican to declare his candidacy. His
chief rivals are two other moderates: Rep. Robert D. Franks, a
four-term congressman and two-time state Republican chairman, and
James W. Treffinger, the Essex County executive. Also running are
two conservatives, Murray Sabrin, a finance professor at Ramapo
College, and Brian T. Kennedy, a former state senator.
</P>
<P>
   Gormley and Franks have been dominating the early but important
organizational phase of the primary campaign, by amassing the
greatest number of endorsements from elected officials and party
leaders. One of the few densely populated counties still largely up
for grabs is Bergen, in northern Jersey; that is why Gormley
appeared here Wednesday at the home of Nick and Jeanne Mazzolla, a
couple active in the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   Gormley, who ran for governor in 1989, sought to distinguish
himself from Franks by recalling his own vote to ban assault
weapons. That decision, he said, prompted the National Rifle
Association to wage ``a vicious soft money campaign'' against him
in his 1991 re-election effort. By contrast, Franks, then an
assemblyman, voted against the assault weapons ban, Gormley told
reporters. And later, when other lawmakers sought to repeal the
ban, Franks failed to vote either way, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I refused to back down,'' Gormley said in his speech.
``Positions as important as a ban on assault weapons should not and
cannot change with the political tide, or bend to the pressure and
money of special interests. We who serve the public and run for
office must take a stand and stick to it. Excuses and double talk
simply do not cut it.''
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Smith, a spokesman for Franks, did not dispute his
Assembly voting record on the assault weapons ban. Instead, he
responded: ``Bob Franks is the only candidate in this race who has
voted for a federal ban on assault weapons, the 1994 crime bill,
and has consistently opposed any attempts to weaken or repeal that
ban.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Thompson, a spokesman for Treffinger, questioned Gormley's
credentials as a tax cutter, pointing out that his voting record in
Trenton had actually begun in 1977. ``Bill Gormley calling himself
a pro-taxpayer is simply not credible,'' Thompson said. ``He has
voted to raise income taxes, sales taxes and even gasoline taxes,
and overall, has voted at least 78 times to raise taxes or fees.''
</P>
<P>
   Gormley, who is known in the State House for a fiery temper and
flashes of anger, lightheartedly referred to such criticism in his
speech Wednesday. ``Some have called me intense,'' he said. ``Many
have said that I am tough and direct. It's true! Hopefully you will
see that these qualities can work for New Jersey.''

FAMILY SURVIVES TRAIN DERAILMENT...BUT PLANS TO FLY NOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM SULLINGER  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARBONDALE, Kan. _ The Kemmerer family left Kansas City, Mo.,
just before midnight Tuesday on Amtrak's Southwest Chief No. 3.
</P>
<P>
   Two hours later, the two Kemmerer children were huddled together
on top of their overturned sleeping car. Inside the dusty, dimly
lit car, their parents, Jacque and Jerald Kemmerer, struggled to
help passengers get out through a window.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are the odds that this would happen on our first train
trip?'' asked Jacque Kemmerer, of Overland Park.
</P>
<P>
   They were among 155 persons, including four crew members and 11
service employees, on board the Chicago-to-Los Angeles train when
it derailed at 2:05 a.m. Wednesday. Twenty-nine passengers were
injured, one woman seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the injured suffered minor cuts and bruises and were
treated at Topeka hospitals and released.
</P>
<P>
   While Amtrak officials were making other travel arrangements for
the passengers, investigators from the National Transportation
Safety Board were sent to the derailment just southwest of
Carbondale.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the derailment was still under investigation
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Workers for the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway were busy
Wednesday repairing the track and clearing the wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   The westbound train with 27 cars and four locomotives left
Chicago at 3:20 p.m. Tuesday and stopped in Kansas City at 11:05
p.m. It left about 15 minutes later and went through Lawrence and
Topeka before derailing. It was traveling about 60 mph on straight
track after coming out of a gentle curve, the train's engineer told
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen cars left the tracks. Six were passenger cars: two
lounges, a diner, two sleepers and a coach. Five of the six came to
rest on their sides beside the track.
</P>
<P>
   Three passenger cars that were immediately in front of the
derailed cars stayed on the tracks.
</P>
<P>
   The Kemmerers were just getting to sleep in one of the two
sleeper cars when they heard a loud, squeaking noise. Then the car
began shaking violently.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went backward once and then forward, almost standing up,''
Jacque Kemmerer said. ``We knew our daughter was on the bottom
(berth), and we were both hollering her name to make sure she was
OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Emergency lights came on, and the car was filled with dust from
sliding on its side. Gravel had spilled in through broken side
windows.
</P>
<P>
   Jerald Kemmerer reached a window _ now overhead _ and opened it.
The couple then lifted out Jerilyn and Jonathan, 12, and handed
blankets and pillows up to them.
</P>
<P>
   Other people were screaming and crying for help, Jacque Kemmerer
said, and she and her husband began letting them know they could
get through the window.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once people learned there was a way out, they started calming
down,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She said her husband began hoisting people through the open
window. In a nearby cabin, a man yelled that he was trapped and
couldn't breathe. Jerald Kemmerer and another passenger pulled
debris off the man.
</P>
<P>
   Jerilyn said it was cold and dark on top of the car while
waiting for rescuers to arrive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sat on mattresses, and my brother was bundled up in
blankets,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Jacque Kemmerer said the couple never worried about fire. They
were too busy helping people out.
</P>
<P>
   Troopers from the Kansas Highway Patrol and deputies from the
Osage County Sheriff's Department arrived and began pulling people
from the train. Two helicopters circled overhead, bathing the
wreckage in light.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this rural area, it's pitch black,'' said Highway Patrol
Sgt. John Eichkorn, one of the first rescuers.
</P>
<P>
   Ambulances began arriving, and those who weren't hurt, including
the Kemmerers, were taken by bus to the Carbondale elementary
school.
</P>
<P>
   Victims began arriving at three Topeka hospitals about 3:15
a.m., said Amy Leiker, communications specialist with Stormont-Vail
Regional Health Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``We called in probably 30 additional staff,'' she said.
``Everything ran very smoothly.''
</P>
<P>
   LaVaughn Durkin, who lives a quarter-mile from the derailment,
said she gathered blankets and took them to the school gym in
Carbondale. Residents also brought in food and coffee.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole community really opened its doors,'' Eichkorn said.
</P>
<P>
   From the elementary school, the passengers were taken to the
Days Inn Capital Centre and the Downtown Ramada Inn in Topeka.
Throughout the day, Amtrak officials worked at the hotels to get
passengers to their destinations.
</P>
<P>
   Debbie Hare, an Amtrak spokesman, said most of the stranded
passengers would be taken to Kansas City to catch another train to
the West Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Some passengers were put on buses and airlines, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Kemmerers were headed to Flagstaff, Ariz., to see relatives
and the Grand Canyon. Jacque Kemmerer said Wednesday afternoon that
the family was trying to make arrangement to fly.
</P>
<P>
   Their luggage, however, was still back at the derailed train.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel we got the two best packages out of that car we could
have,'' she said, referring to her children. ``That's all we care
about.''

BOY, 12, AND GIRL, 14, CHARGED IN SCHOOL SHOOTING PLOT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GORDY HOLT and RUTH SCHUBERT  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHIMACUM, Wash. _ Neighbors said it ``must be some kind of
misunderstanding.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jefferson County prosecutors took another view, and
Wednesday charged a 12-year-old Port Townsend boy and a 14-year-old
female classmate from Shine, Wash., with conspiracy to commit
murder in a plot to shoot up Chimacum Middle School.
</P>
<P>
   They intended to kill classmates, teachers and school
administrators, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   As outlined by Deputy Prosecutor Michael Hass, the plot was the
boy's idea, but the girl refined it in a telephone conversation
with her alleged co-conspirator.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few minutes into the conversation, (the girl) ... made
suggestions for foolproofing the plan,'' Haas said. ``Specifically,
she suggested (that the boy) obtain silencers to use in the
massacre ... and to cut phone lines.''
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said the boy and a 14-year-old cousin attempted to
obtain guns from the cousin's gang friends in Tacoma, Wash. But the
plot came unhinged almost from the start.
</P>
<P>
   The boys abandoned a car they had stolen from their grandfather
when they spotted police. When they eventually did get to Tacoma on
Feb. 19, their friends were in jail. It's unclear whether the gang
had weapons.
</P>
<P>
   So the boys went home empty handed, only to be foiled by
overheard talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank God,'' said Chimacum School District Superintendent Mary
Lynne Derrington.
</P>
<P>
   Derrington said word of the alleged plot leaked about two weeks
ago when a student overheard talk and reported it to a staff
member, who called police.
</P>
<P>
   The boy who was charged Wednesday told police he was angry at
classmates and teachers at Chimacum Middle School, and hatched the
plot to get even. He attended the school by permission because he
is a resident of Port Townsend. That permission to attend was
revoked two weeks ago. Derrington said two Chimacum Middle School
girls also were expelled because of the incident.
</P>
<P>
   The boy's cousin did not attend school in either district,
according to Port Townsend School District Superintendent Carol
Andreasen.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as we can tell, they wanted to (shoot) administration
people in general, one specific juvenile and one classroom,'' Haas
said. ``It did not appear that the female planned to take part in
the shooting, but there is an indication she planned to be involved
in cutting telephone lines.''
</P>
<P>
   Haas said the two students were not charged as adults. If the
students are convicted, prosecutors will seek to keep them in
custody until they are 21. The standard sentencing range for
juveniles convicted of the Class A felony is 15 to 36 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The boy was in custody Wednesday afternoon and the girl had not
been picked up, Jefferson County Prosecutor Juelanne Dalvall said.
Their names were not being released by prosecutors due to their
ages, Dalvall said.
</P>
<P>
   The far-flung Chimacum School District and its 1,740 students
stretches from the southern boundary of the Port Townsend School
District south down the Olympic Peninsula to Dabob Bay, and serves
a diverse socio-economic population.
</P>
<P>
   Its communities range from a low-income belt in and around
Chimacum and Irondale, south past the posh reaches of Port Ludlow
to Shine, a rapidly changing, old neighborhood of saltwater views
and double-wide housing. Three-car garages are now pushing out the
carports.
</P>
<P>
   Shine is where the girl, her parents and two sisters live, and
where two next-door neighbors, husband and wife, expressed shock
Wednesday. They stood on their front porch, a stunning view of Hood
Canal visible behind them.
</P>
<P>
   ``My heart's breaking for those people,'' said the woman,
stubbing out a cigarette. ``Must have been just a childish thing,
something to impress a boy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These are nice people,'' said her husband. ``Their girls mean
everything to them. They took them everywhere; to basketball games,
you name it.''
</P>
<P>
   At the girl suspect's house, blinds were drawn and a black dog
barked from behind a back fence. But no one answered the door.
</P>
<P>
   No one answered the door of the boy suspect's home on E Street
in Port Townsend, either.
</P>
<P>
   Across a side street, another neighbor would not identify
herself but said she knew the boy's grandparents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think `murder' is a bit extravagent,'' she said of the
prosecutors' charge. ``But these days, you can't take a chance, can
you?''
</P>
<P>
   Chimicum and Port Townsend school officials would not talk in
detail about the suspects, citing privacy concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Part-time security officer Gary Ingersoll said the boy ``had had
problems in Port Townsend,'' before arrving at Chimacum.
</P>
<P>
   But Chimacum Middle School Principal Kathy Wales said her
district does not accept transfers without checking out
disciplinary problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do a pretty good check on interdistrict transfer
students,'' Wales said.
</P>
<P>
   History teacher Barb Aldrich, after saying that she didn't want
to violate the privacy of the students or the school, said that she
hadn't had any problems with the students allegedly involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing I can say that would shed any light on them,''
Aldrich said. ``I've had no disciplinary problems with them.''
</P>
<P>
   The indictments came as a surpise to many at the middle school,
which shares a campus with the town's elementary and high schools.
</P>
<P>
   Ingersoll, who said he often picks up rumors and complaints from
the students, knew nothing about the alleged plot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little surprised _ and for the first time a little
nervous about the whole situation _ simply because I didn't know,
it didn't get back to me somehow,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although some teachers said they felt secure knowing that the
alleged conspirators are in custody, Ingersoll for one remains a
bit nervous.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking at everybody and really making a point of getting
to know the loners this week,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Anglin, who manages a gas-and-feed store just south of the
Chimacum complex, said he had heard about the threats several weeks
ago but was shocked at Wednesday's news.
</P>
<P>
   ``You gotta feel for kids like that who can't cope,'' he said.

   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Alexander Mogilny is supposed to be the
sniper the Devils have been missing for years, but it will take him
awhile to display his scoring prowess for his new teammates. The
Russian right wing, who was acquired from Vancouver on Tuesday,
just before the trading deadline, showed little in his Devils debut
as New Jersey suffered a 3-2 loss to the Dallas Stars on Wednesday
night in a game between division leaders.

   Mogilny's best chances came moments apart in the second minute
of the third period while the game was tied. He was denied both
times by goaltender Manny Fernandez, the first time from close
range on the right and then on a backhander from the slot.
</P>
<P>
   Mogilny, who scored his 21st goal of the season for Vancouver
Monday night, had another chance with two minutes left and the
Devils trailing by a goal, but he was denied again by Fernandez,
this time at his right doorstep. Fernandez was playing in place of
Ed Belfour, who was at Continental Arena, but has missed the last
four games after being arrested last week on charges of assaulting
a hotel security guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been feeling better lately and started to put the puck in
the net,'' Mogilny said. ``I'm excited to be here because this is a
really good hockey team and coming into this team has increased my
confidence level. It'll take a little time to adjust because for me
it's a culture shock right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Mogilny said he planned to use his speed and his ability to take
defenders on one-on-one and go to the net.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a guy who is going to take it behind the net,''
Mogilny said. ``I'm going to take it all the way through, beat
three or four guys and score.''
</P>
<P>
   Mogilny likes to be around Russian friends, but that is no
longer one of his priorities. He said that the presence of
Assistant Coach Slava Fetisov and three other Russian players on
the team would not make him feel any more comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a big, big boy now,'' Mogilny said. ``I've been in this
league for 11 years now and I'm used to changes, but I still have
to make an adjustment with this team.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars paid extra attention to Mogilny, and that allowed his
linemates, Scott Gomez on the left and Sergei Nemchinov at center,
to get plenty of room and create chances. But that came only after
the Devils fell behind on two goals 35 seconds apart early in the
first period.
</P>
<P>
   Both goals came during a four-on-four situation, with Jamie
Langerbrunner scoring first from close range on the right, and
Richard Matvichuk scoring on the fourth shot of the game for the
Stars.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas dominated the rest of the first period, but the Devils
cut the deficit to 2-1 when Patrik Elias got his 30th goal of the
season with 4 minutes 36 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Elias is the first player with the Devils to reach the 30-goal
plateau since the 1993-94 season, when John MacLean, now with the
Rangers, had 37 goals and Stephane Richer, now with St. Louis, had
36.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Arnott tied it with his 19th goal at 5:51 of the second
period, after Elias, twice, and Petr Sykora had chances in the same
sequence. Elias' first attempt hit the post while the Dallas
defense was caught chasing the puck.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Modano scored the winner with his 33rd goal of the season,
at 5:50 of the third period, when he threw the puck into the crease
from the left side. Scott Stevens and Arnott were on top of the
puck but they failed to clear it from behind the fallen Martin
Brodeur after it hit Stevens' skate. &QL;

REPORT ON ANGOLA SANCTIONS IS CHALLENGED IN THE U.N. 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to add 3 grafs of background to end.)  
(js) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ An explosive report on how sanctions against a
rebel army in Angola are being broken, and by whom, provoked a
heated debate Wednesday in the Security Council. A dozen or more
African and European nations challenged the investigators' methods
and evidence.
</P>
<P>
   French-speaking Africans charged bias in the investigation,
which was ordered by Canada's U.N. representative and led by a
Swedish diplomat. France was also critical, saying the report was
imprecise in making allegations and vague on dates and other facts.
</P>
<P>
   The report, by 10 international experts working for the
council's committee on sanctions in Angola, implicated two current
African presidents as well as the government of Bulgaria and the
world's largest diamond exchange, in Antwerp, Belgium, in the
methods that rebels have used to smuggle Angolan diamonds to buy
weapons to sustain decades of civil war.
</P>
<P>
   The report also tracked illegal fuel shipments to the rebels,
known as the Unita movement, led by Jonas Savimbi. The rebels have
suffered battlefield setbacks recently at the hands of the Angolan
army, and these losses of territory, coupled with warnings that the
Security Council was planning to publicize allegations of sanctions
violations, have already cut into the illegal diamond trade,
members of the investigating panel said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The war in Angola, a nation of 12 million people, has left 1
million dead, and 3 million are now displaced from their homes.
About 200 people, many children, are dying every day, relief
organizations say. Unicef calls Angola the most dangerous country
in the world in which to be a child.
</P>
<P>
   The investigating panel was the first to be created by the
Security Council, which normally relies on carefully worded reports
from the U.N. Secretariat and information collected by individual
nations' intelligence services, rarely shared with others.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Fowler, the Canadian representative, who is chairman of
the committee on sanctions in Angola and will be the Security
Council president in April, organized the panel. He intends to
press the Security Council to put sanctions on countries or leaders
involved in the illegal arms and diamond trade, as recommended by
the panel. The investigation was led by Anders Mollander, a Swedish
Foreign Ministry official who was formerly ambassador to Angola.
</P>
<P>
   With Bulgaria in mind, the panel also asked the European Union
and NATO to evaluate how candidates for membership abide by
sanctions rules. The Bulgarians are accused of shipping arms to
Savimbi through third countries and of training Unita soldiers in
the guise of troops from Zaire, now Congo.
</P>
<P>
   There were 39 recommendations in all, some of them technical
suggestions for how to trace illegal exports and imports or monitor
traffic in the region where Savimbi is based. Others were more
political, including a call for a ban on international conferences
in nations accused of violating sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The panel has done exactly what we asked them to do,'' Fowler
said at a news conference Wednesday after presenting his report to
the council. ``They have named names. They have identified
sanctions busting both in terms of the busters and the methods of
busting.''
</P>
<P>
   Fowler's experiment with the sanctions in Angola is being
watched closely in the Security Council and among all member
nations of the United Nations because no diplomat has tried to turn
his committee into an active enforcer of an embargo.
</P>
<P>
   Several delegations applauded the experiment, but others are
wary of what they see as a trend in the United Nations toward
interfering in countries' internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Hain, the minister of state in charge of African affairs
in the British Foreign Office, told the Security Council Wednesday,
``It is no good putting our hands up in the U.N. for sanctions, and
then taking no action while citizens in our countries make money
out of misery.'' He welcomed the report as a demonstration, at
least to Savimbi, that ``now there is nowhere to hide.''
</P>
<P>
   Fowler said his report to the council ``offered a blueprint for
change,'' and said: ``Sanctions had been grievously flouted for
nearly seven years. Every member of this organization knows these
sanctions have been violated.''
</P>
<P>
   All countries named in the report were given the right to reply
in the Security Council Wednesday. All denied the allegations
against them or tried to explain how investigators had
misunderstood them or not listened. But in almost every case,
representatives pledged to cooperate in closing loopholes if any
did exist.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The report, completed within six months with visits to 30
countries, was a gamble, because in the time assigned them, the
arms experts _ from Botswana, Namibia, South Africa, Zimbabwe,
China, Russia, France, Switzerland, Sweden and the United States _
could not gather as much hard evidence as many nations were
demanding to see Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   More than a dozen nations questioned the heavy reliance on
interviews with defectors from Unita who had since joined the
Angolan Army. Stanlake M. Samkange, a Zimbabwean lawyer and arms
expert who wrote the report, countered at a news conference that
these defectors provided corroboration for evidence already
gathered elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Togo's representative, Roland Y. Kpotsra, dismissed the report
as ``rumor, hearsay, and scraps that are considered verified
because they are confirmed by Unita defectors.'' The report accuses
Togo's president, Gnassingbe Eyadema, of helping Savimbi obtain
arms and fuel.
</P>
<P>
   Blaise Compaore of Burkina Faso was the second president named
in the report as an active partner in Savimbi's illegal trading
operations. Wednesday, the representative of Burkina Faso, Michel
Kafando, told the Security Council that this was a ``report built
on illusions rather than on certainties.'' The government denied
the allegations when they were first reported last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Rwanda's envoy, Joseph W. Mutaboba, denied that
officials there had allowed Unita to use the country as a base for
making diamond deals, as the report alleged. He said these were
``wild allegations.''
</P>
<P>
   Several envoys speaking for their nations said they had not
received copies of the 59-page report until Tuesday and could not
reply in detail.
</P>
<P>
   The work of the investigating panel produced some pre-emptive
action. Belgium issued new rules governing diamond sales on March
4, but the report had been largely written by then. Last year, De
Beers, the world's largest diamond trader, said it would no longer
buy Angolan diamonds except from a mine in which it has a direct
interest. Angola said it was also tightening the legal trade of
gems.
</P>
<P>
   South Africa, where the government was not implicated but some
citizens were, on Wednesday outlined steps it has taken to cut ties
to Unita. In the Security Council, the South African
representative, Dumisani S. Kumalo, said the country would take
``firm action'' against any citizens still violating sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Fowler's panel measures pledges of cooperation as a success,
since the aim of the panel, its members said Wednesday, was to end
the war in Angola by severing its chief protagonist from his
illegal supplies of weapons and fuel. The report also had some
criticism for the Angolan government, particularly in what it saw
as complicity in smuggling fuel to rebel territory.
</P>
<P>
   Security Council sanctions were first imposed on Unita, which
had been supported by the United States and Mobutu Sese Seko of
Zaire during the Cold War, in 1993. This followed Unita's refusal
to accept its defeat in 1992 elections, which were won by a leftist
party. The sanctions barred the sale of arms and fuel to Unita.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 the council broadened the sanctions. In 1998, with
mounting evidence that Savimbi was still arming by selling
diamonds, the Security Council further expanded sanctions to
prohibit anyone from buying diamonds from Unita or Unita-controlled
territory.

<P>
   PORT WASHINGTON, N.Y. _ Theories are abounding here as to why
Paul D. Schreiber High School achieved a stunning victory in the
nationwide Intel Science Talent Search this year, producing the
first-place winner and two other finalists and stealing the thunder
of the highly selective New York City schools that have
traditionally dominated the contest.
</P>
<P>
   Viviana Risca, a Romanian immigrant who won first prize for
encrypting a secret message on a strand of DNA, surmised that since
Schreiber was smaller than schools like Stuyvesant in Manhattan and
the Bronx High School of Science, its students got more personal
attention from teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas Hanft, whose sociology experiment assessing political
learnings on Long Island and in New York City landed him among the
finalists, said that Port Washington must have had a ``particularly
excellent gene pool'' in 1982, the year that he was born.
</P>
<P>
   And Dr. Sidney Barish, the school principal, said a combination
of factors practically guaranteed that Schreiber students would
shine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we don't specialize in science but we've got bright
kids, supportive families and a school district willing to
invest,'' Barish said.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the main reason that Schreiber students excel in a
contest that rewards scientific research is that 15 years ago it
started a program to teach students how to perform sophisticated
research. School officials had noticed that several neighboring
schools were grooming students for what was then called the
Westinghouse Science Talent Search.
</P>
<P>
   Under the program, students apply to the program in their
freshman year and for the next three years they spend at least an
hour a day learning how to hypothesize, experiment and draw valid
conclusions. By their junior year, most of the students in the
program are paired with professional researchers.
</P>
<P>
   The school had its first semifinalist in the Westinghouse
competition in 1987. Thirteen years later, Port Washington _ an
affluent hamlet that was the model for East Egg in ``The Great
Gatsby'' _ has produced 72 semifinalists and 12 finalists.
</P>
<P>
   Hanft said that ``just about all the smart kids'' applied to the
research programs, even if they were not particularly interested in
science or math.
</P>
<P>
   Joshua Brandstadter, the 16-year-old sophomore who is
experimenting with the fruit flies, said it was ``nerve-racking''
to think about spending two more increasingly difficult years in
the research program. During a recent vacation, he had to come into
school every day to see if his flies had died _ ``a drag,'' he
said. But otherwise, Brandstadter said, he was happy to be a
scientist-in-training.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't start working this hard in high school,'' he
said, ``you're never going to be prepared for the real world.''

ROTATION LEAVES MANY QUESTIONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. _ Lefty Carlos Perez is perilously hanging
onto a slim hope of making the Dodgers' starting rotation, and even
without pitching, the opportunity seems to be shrinking. But Perez
isn't the only Dodgers starter having a doozy of a time this
spring.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie right-hander Eric Gagne, a near-lock for the fourth spot
in the rotation, is still breathing heavy, still trying to calm
down and still trying to prove his worth while runners circle
around him on the bases.
</P>
<P>
   For the third time in three spring outings, Gagne gave up a
bundle of runs, this time against the Mets. But he also showed
Johnson why he deserves some slack. Gagne's strike zone shrunk a
few inches on both sides of the plate in the early innings, but he
remained composed and just kept pitching.
</P>
<P>
   ``Umpires are going to test you,'' Johnson said. ``You're going
to throw the ball over the plate and they're going to see how you
react, and he didn't react. For him to hang in there and not let it
bother him, that's a good sign.''
</P>
<P>
   Gagne gave up a homer to Edgardo Alfonzo after he appeared to
throw a perfect strike. He followed that by striking out Mike
Piazza on a wonderful slow breaking ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as I keep improving, that's all that matters right
now,'' said Gagne, who's ERA actually dropped to 15.58. ``I'm
trying to get ready for a season. Like Davey says, it's only spring
training, you don't worry about it. You always want to do good. I
hate losing. Hate losing.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're a rookie, you don't get the corners like Piazza
gets. That's all right, though. They've been around. They deserve
it.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Blue chip again: Catching prospect Angel Pena, who entered
camp at 262 pounds, has lost 15 pounds and looked so good lately
that manager Davey Johnson gave him back his top-prospect tag.
</P>
<P>
   Pena will start the season in the minors, but his progress will
be closely monitored since catcher Todd Hundley is a free agent
after the season. Pena, hitting .308 this spring, is the heir
apparent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really proud he's taken it on his own this spring to start
working out,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Pena disappointed the Dodgers because he was out of shape last
year, wasn't working hard during his time with the big-league club
and then was suspended for a week when he had trouble with the
coaching staff.
</P>
<P>
   __ Odds and ends: Scott Boras, agent for third baseman Adrian
Beltre, and Bob Daly, Dodgers managing partner and CEO, continued
to talk on the phone and both sides remain hopeful an agreement on
a three-year deal can be worked out by Friday. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Hundley continues to be slowed by back spasms. He missed his
fourth consecutive game, but manager Davey Johnson said the issue
is not serious. Hundley remains day-to-day. ``That's nothing
compared to what we through last year,'' Johnson said. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Mike Fetters is scheduled to pitch today and
Johnson said right-hander Gregg Olson (inflammation in right elbow)
should also be available. . . . The club gave infielder Craig
Counsell his unconditional release and he can sign with any team.
Counsell hit .259 in 50 games for the Dodgers last season.

FRESHMAN MAKING MOST OF UCLA OPPORTUNITY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Her UCLA teammates watch Nicole Kaczmarski on the
basketball court and forget she's just a freshman. She doesn't
behave like other freshmen.
</P>
<P>
   ``A.J.'s (Jalina Bradley) always late. Kaz isn't,'' senior
forward Maylana Martin said. ``(Natalie) Jarrett, she's goofy. She
always asks questions like a freshman.''
</P>
<P>
   Senior guard Erica Gomez chimed in: ``Jarrett, you want to reach
out and help her.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin continued: ``Yeah, but Kaz is in a different position.
She's more a sophomore now.''
</P>
<P>
   It's true Kaczmarski had to learn on the job and had no time to
ease into college life. Injuries to Gomez and Michelle Greco made
it impossible, so Kaczmarski started immediately, often at the
point.
</P>
<P>
   The results: Kaczmarski averaged 11.6 points a game, second
highest on the team, and earned All-Conference Freshman Team
honors. She likely will start when the Bruins meet George
Washington in an NCAA Tournament first-round game Friday at South
Bend, Ind.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can tell she doesn't feel like she doesn't belong,'' UCLA
coach Kathy Olivier said. ``She's confident out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaczmarski never has lacked confidence since signing with the
Bruins out of Sachem High on Long Island, where she was the
Gatorade National Player of the Year and a USA Today All-American.
</P>
<P>
   But here, so far away from home, she had to adjust like any
other freshman, going from the go-to player on her high school team
to just another role player on a senior-dominated squad. No longer
could her family watch her play, and the homesickness set in. With
it came rumors Kaczmarski would transfer to a school closer to
home, perhaps Rutgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes a certain person like that, leaving home and getting
on a plane,'' she said. ``The first couple of weeks, I wondered
what did I do. . . . But no, I made this decision (to attend UCLA)
based on the program. I don't plan on leaving. I just got here.''
</P>
<P>
   Plus, she's playing. A lot. Averaging 29 minutes a game.
</P>
<P>
   This wasn't supposed to happen, but Gomez began the season
recovering from shoulder surgery, so Olivier had little choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got thrown into it,'' Kaczmarski said. ``That was a little
bit of pressure. I was happy I got to play right away.''
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't easy. Seniors such as Martin and Janae Hubbard had
grown accustomed to Gomez getting them the ball. Kaczmarski didn't
know her teammates' tendencies and preferences, and the Bruins
struggled in wins over Pepperdine and Fullerton and in losses to
nationally ranked teams Tennessee, Connecticut, Rutgers and
Louisiana Tech.
</P>
<P>
   Kaczmarski tried to do too much and it showed in her shooting:
33 percent in her first nine games. Once she stopped (and once
players healed), she eased into her role as shooting guard/backup
point guard. In the last 13 games, she is shooting 45.4 percent and
has made 41 of her last 47 free throws.
</P>
<P>
   Her relaxed self was most evident when she sank 10 of 12
3-pointers in last week's win over Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Kaczmarski didn't say much this season, nor will she against
George Washington. But wait until next year, when she really is a
sophomore.

ASSEMBLY DEMOCRATS PROPOSE BUDGET $1.3 BILLION BIGGER THAN
PATAKI'S 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Democrats who control the state Assembly on
Wednesday proposed a $78.2 billion budget, significantly more money
than Gov. George Pataki wants to spend, setting the stage for yet
another protracted budget fight.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed budget is $5.3 billion, or 7.3 percent, higher than
the one that the governor and the Legislature enacted last year. It
relies on the state's surging tax revenues to finance large
increases in spending for health care, public schools, and state
colleges and universities, as well as a smattering of new tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The budget we're adopting responsibly supports education, job
creation, tax cuts and health care,'' said Sheldon Silver, the
Democratic speaker of the Assembly. ``It responds to the real need
of the people of our state.''
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the Democratic plan would spend $1.3 billion, or 1.8
percent, more than the proposal Pataki released earlier this year.
The governor's $76.8 billion budget proposal is $3.5 billion, or
5.5 percent, larger than the one enacted last year.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki, a Republican, has warned lawmakers that the state could
be headed for fiscal trouble if it does not restrain spending.
Indeed, independent fiscal monitors have cautioned that the state
could face huge budget shortfalls in future years because of the
anticipated cost of tax cuts and new benefit programs enacted in
previous budgets.
</P>
<P>
   But legislative leaders from both major parties are likely to
hold out for more money than the governor has proposed in a variety
of areas, largely because all 211 members of the Legislature are up
for re-election this year and eager to finance programs that are
popular with their constituents.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest difference between the Democrats and Pataki is in
education. The Democrats are calling for a $1.3 billion, or 10.3
percent, rise in state aid to schools, compared with the $355
million, or 2.8 percent, increase that the governor requested in
his budget.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's Republican allies in the state Senate have
already proposed a $900 million increase for public schools,
placing even greater pressure on him to move beyond the amount that
he has proposed.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic proposal restores $117 million in cuts that the
governor's budget makes to educational programs that largely
benefit New York City: one that raises the salaries of teachers in
urban school districts and another that provides such districts
money to undertake minor maintenance projects in aging school
buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats would also pump money into a statewide program
intended to expand prekindergarten classes and reduce class sizes.
The Democrats called for providing $170 million more than the $20
million increase Pataki proposed for these programs.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats also proposed providing $60 million for a handful of
other programs that the governor did not seek any increases for,
like expanding after-school offerings in relatively poor urban
school districts.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic leaders also unveiled a tax-cut package, saying it
would save New York taxpayers $750 million over the next four
years. The centerpiece of the package calls for raising standard
deductions for married couples who file income taxes jointly to
$15,000 a year from $13,000, saving taxpayers $180 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic plan also expands a state program that subsidizes
prescription drug purchases for the elderly, proposing to more than
double the number of people eligible for the coverage. The plan
calls for adding $308 million to the $148 million that the state
pays annually to provide prescription drug coverage for the
elderly. That would raise the number of people enrolled in the
program to 224,000 from 112,000.

NEW DEVELOPMENT WILL BE WIRED INTO INTERNET

   &LR; Valencia, Calif. _ Newhall Ranch will be wired for speed under
a deal between its developer, The Newhall Land &AMP; Farming Company,
and SBC Communications Inc., the parent company of Pacific Bell.
</P>
<P>
   The project will encompass 30,000 homes and thousands of
businesses, making Newhall Ranch and parts of Valencia the first
communities in Southern California to be built from the ground up
with the infrastructure in place for high-speed Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to installing digital subscriber line connections in
every new home, Pacific Bell will install fiber optic voice and
data communications infrastructure in all of Valencia and Newhall
Ranch's new residential and commercial/industrial developments.
</P>
<P>
   Located about 30 miles north of Los Angeles, Newhall Ranch will
have new shopping centers along with more than 20,000 homes, making
the community bigger than most cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``That community could have the most advanced communications of
any community. They can maybe get fiber within 6,000 feet of every
customer,'' said Rex Mitchell, telecommunications analyst with Bank
of America Montgomery Securities. ``Being able to offer high-speed
digital services across the board to all of their customers is
their future.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal, Pacific Bell will install high-speed DSL wiring
in each new house built at Newhall Ranch and in Valencia beginning
with the Bridgeport development.
</P>
<P>
   SBC and Newhall Land also will collaborate on Intranet for
Valencia, providing an online connection for neighbors linking them
to schools, clubs, local businesses and community information.
</P>
<P>
   Although the deal does not give Pacific Bell exclusive rights to
provide DSL in the community, it is a demonstration of the
company's ability to provide the latest voice and data
communications technology, Mitchell said. The revenue effect will
be minimal for SBC Communications, he said.
</P>
<P>
   For neighbors already developed, Pacific Bell officials said the
company plans to go back and install high-speed Internet access
service on a priority basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``There currently exists a fiber infrastructure out there, and
that certainly will be expanded as the commercial and business
development grows,'' said Pacific Bell spokesman Steve Getzug. ``We
plan to extend fiber further into the residential communities in
order that all of our customers can take advantage of DSL.''
</P>
<P>
   DSL gives customers Internet connections as much as 50 times
faster than regular dial-up service.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our current residents and our future customers are very
interested in technology. They recognize it is a critical component
in their way of life, both from an individual and a business
standpoint,'' said Newhall Land and Farming spokeswoman Marlee
Lauffer. The deal ``ensures that Pacific Bell will prioritize
getting any current and new technologies to our communities.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ In a last-ditch effort to influence Taiwan's
presidential election, Prime Minister Zhu Rongji said Wednesday
that the Chinese people were ``willing to use all their blood'' to
prevent the island's independence.
</P>
<P>
   But, at the same time, he played down a recent Chinese policy
paper that threatened military action against the island if it
delayed indefinitely talks on reunification, saying, ``There's
nothing new in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan, which holds its election on Saturday, dominated Zhu's
90-minute news conference marking the end of this year's session of
parliament. In language that was on balance more incendiary than
calming, Zhu reiterated Beijing's position on the island it
considers a breakaway province.
</P>
<P>
   It was the last major opportunity in a month-long campaign by
the Chinese government to use fighting words to pressure Taiwanese
candidates and voters. And Zhu made clear that the government has
strong preferences.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter who comes into power in Taiwan, Taiwan will never be
allowed to be independent,'' he said. If the ``people who favor
independence'' win, he later added, it is ``a logical
inevitability'' that such a result might ``undermine peace.''
</P>
<P>
   There were several such references to Chen Shui-bian, the
presidential candidate whose opposition Democratic Progressive
Party has advocated formal independence in the past, although Chen
has moderated that position in this election. In recent days,
Chinese officials and Communist Party newspapers have lobbed
numerous thinly veiled attacks at Chen, saying he is ``tricking''
the Taiwanese and still at heart ``a separatist.''
</P>
<P>
   ``His mainland policy is merely a tactic to win the election, to
pick up votes and deceive voters,'' said Xu Bodong, a Chinese
foreign policy expert, on state television Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Chen is in a tight three-way race for the presidency. None of
the candidates currently advocates a declaration of independence,
and Beijing's threatening words are aimed to keep it that way.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu spoke with passion, but it was an odd role for the
government's leading economic reformer, who has never been its
point person on Taiwan. About half way through the news conference,
the usually straight-talking prime minister seemed exasperated and
refused to answer further questions on Taiwan, although reporters
kept bringing up the subject.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Again and again, Zhu repeated that China did not fear war, if it
came to that. And he lambasted foreign analysts who have recently
argued that the Chinese military lacks the capability to take
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   ``They do not know the history of China and that the Chinese
people will use all of their blood to defend the unity of the
Chinese nation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   On several occasions, Zhu declined to re-assure Taiwan that
there would be no violence before or after the election. For
example, when a Taiwanese journalist asked if China plans to
conduct military exercises this week near Taiwan, as it did four
years ago in a bid to influence Taiwan's last presidential
election, he said: ``Let's just wait and see. But don't worry too
much, because there are only two days left.''
</P>
<P>
   But at other points, Zhu reiterated the government's position
that its goal is peaceful reunification with Taiwan, and said that
the alarmed reaction abroad to the policy paper released last month
was unwarranted.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu said that document, which has angered some U.S. politicians
to the point that they have pledged to fight China's bid to enter
the World Trade Organization, did not represent a shift to a more
bellicose policy.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, he said, the Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping accused
anti-China forces ``in a certain nation'' of using an innocuous
position paper that was meant to be a ``comprehensive and detailed
exposition of China's long standing policy'' to their political
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he expressed hope that the current tensions would not
scuttle China's entry to the WTO or damage relations with the
United States. He said he did not want to connect the Taiwan
question ``with other issues related to China-U.S. relations.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the brief interludes when Zhu managed to move away from talk
of Taiwan, he solicited foreign investment for Chinese development
projects, praised China's current anti-corruption drive, and said
the government would soon clarify its new policies on the Internet
and telecommunications sector.
</P>
<P>
   But he was at his most emotional on the issue of Taiwan, giving
even declarations of brotherhood vaguely threatening undertones.
</P>
<P>
   ``We trust that our Taiwanese compatriots will make a sensible
choice'' in Saturday's election, he said. But he added that, if
they did not, they might not ``get another opportunity.''

CLEMENCY IS DENIED FOR POLAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Patrick Poland leaned forward and, in a shaking voice, spoke to
the families of the men he killed nearly 23 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to say I'm sorry. I've lived with this every day, and I
wish I could just go back in time,'' said Poland, 50. ``I hope
everyone can accept my apology, understand me and forgive me.''
</P>
<P>
   But despite Poland's remorse and passionate pleas to spare his
life, the Arizona Board of Executive Clem ency voted, 4-1, on
Tuesday to go ahead with Poland's execution.
</P>
<P>
   He is scheduled to die by lethal injection at 3 p.m. today at
the state prison in Florence for killing ar mored-van guards Cecil
Newkirk and Russell Dempsey in May 1977. Po land would be the 21st
inmate executed in Arizona since the state resumed capital
punishment in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel for Patrick Poland, and I hope he can truly repent for
what he did,'' Newkirk's grandson, Cecil III, said after the
hearing. ``I'm sure if he could go back, things would be different.
But, unfortunately, it can't be like that. He has to serve (his
sentence) for what he did.''
</P>
<P>
   Poland's attorney, Tom Gorman, filed a last-minute appeal with
the U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday night. A decision is expected
today.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's it. That's the highest court there is,'' Gorman said.
``We're hoping they will grant us a stay.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's eight-hour hearing was marked by tearful pleas for
mercy and heartbreaking stories of abuse that Poland suffered as a
child at the hands of his father. Three of his siblings, including
his twin brother, Jeff, and his two children spoke in his behalf.
So did two prosecutors and the FBI agent who once rallied to put
Poland on death row.
</P>
<P>
   All wanted Poland's death sentence reduced to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look in my father's eyes and I've got so much love for him,
and I feel like I'm 4 years old again,'' said Guy Poland, Patrick's
son. ``I love my father so much, I can't even imagine being here
without him.''
</P>
<P>
   Several times during breaks Tuesday, Guy and his sister, Stacey,
looked toward the enclosed chamber where their father sat, and
mouthed, ``I love you, Dad.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We were realistic and we knew it probably wouldn't happen,''
Stacey said after the board's decision. ``Ev erything that could
have been done has been done.''
</P>
<P>
   After the hearing, Guy and Stacey said their final goodbyes
through the glass of a visitation booth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love him; he knows that,'' Stacey said. ``And I told him to
give me a kiss.''
</P>
<P>
   Poland has asked that his family not witness his execution.
</P>
<P>
   He and his brother, Michael, posed as highway patrolmen to pull
over a Purolator Inc. armored van, steal $288,000 and kill both
guards. They then drove 250 miles to Lake Mead, wrapped Newkirk and
Dempsey in custom-made canvas bags weighted with rocks and dropped
them from a rented boat to a watery grave.
</P>
<P>
   Newkirk's widow said in a letter to the board that ``the Poland
brothers cheated my husband from many years of happiness.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Does this man deserve to die?'' Lola Newkirk wrote. ``Yes, he
does! He must pay with his life! This will not bring back my dear
husband, but justice must be served.'' &QL;

INTERVIEW WITH BUSH ON CAMPAIGN ISSUES AND ELECTION STRATEGY

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ _ Following are excerpts from an interview
Wednesday with Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, as recorded by The New
York Times:
</P>
<P>
   Q. What is your reaction to Al Gore's statement that he had
asked the Democratic National Committee to refrain from running
issue ads financed with soft money?
</P>
<P>
   BUSH: It's kind of a gimmick. He has no credibility, as far as
I'm concerned. I don't trust him. I don't trust him. I don't trust
him. He needs to stand up in front of the unions, to get all his
friends not to run issue ads. I don't trust the man. He has no
credibility, as far as I'm concerned, about campaign funding
reform. . . .
</P>
<P>
   You've got to understand my position: I don't trust him. I don't
believe what he says he's going to do. He needs to say the same
thing to the labor unions, to all the folks who are out there
getting ready to spend millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Why not call his bluff?
</P>
<P>
   BUSH: I'm running against a man that I believe will say anything
to get elected. I believe that. And I am amazed. Last week, it was,
we're going to ban all soft money. At the same time, in your
newspaper, you reported that President Clinton was out raising soft
money and Vice President Gore, the very same day or the next day,
in your paper, accurately reported by you all, was getting ready to
go raise $35 million and proud of it. So you can understand why I'm
somewhat skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   Q. As a politician/competitor, what do you think of him?
</P>
<P>
   BUSH: I believe he'll say anything to get elected, that's what I
believe.
</P>
<P>
   Q. If he's willing to say and do anything, how do you not end up
having a whole bunch of the time in this campaign consumed by him
doing and saying things and you responding?
</P>
<P>
   BUSH: It's very important for me to enunciate clearly where I
want to lead the country. In order for me to win, I need to talk
about my vision of reform and the ideas that are necessary to
achieve reform. There's no question about that. I hope to be able
to counterpunch quickly and move directly to where I want to lead
America. That's what Americans want to hear. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do you think the public wants a president who desperately
wants it that badly?
</P>
<P>
   BUSH: I think what the public wants is somebody who can lift the
spirit of this country. The public wants somebody who will bring
honor and dignity to the White House. This country's so great, and
the future's going to be incredibly positive. They want to hear
that. And I understand politics. I understand what goes on in a
political campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Wasn't that lost in fighting over tactics during primaries?
Can't that happen again if Gore acts as McCain did?
</P>
<P>
   BUSH: First of all, Al Gore is no John McCain. Please don't lump
John into that category. Secondly, I think John McCain is a person
that basically wanted to elevate the discourse and had a reason for
running, rather than tearing somebody down.
</P>
<P>
   I know everybody said this was a dirty campaign. Compared to
many campaigns, it wasn't and the proof is that we had huge
turnouts in our primaries, huge, much bigger than the Democrats and
much bigger than the past. And the reason why was in spite of what
the punditry said, people were hearing positive things. They were
hearing positive things about education. They were hearing things
about the military.
</P>
<P>
   I know that some are saying that people aren't interested in tax
relief. I happen to think they are. And even if they weren't, I'd
still be talking about it, because I happen to think it's important
for the economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Polls say voters aren't demanding a huge tax cut and that
they trust Al Gore more on the tax issue. Is that not like
campaigning with weights around your ankles?
</P>
<P>
   BUSH: May I make something really clear to you, once again, and
I hope this pleases you. I don't care what the polls say. I don't.
. . .I'm doing what I think what's wrong. I think it's right for
economic reasons. You've heard me talk about what's wrong with this
tax code. It's wrong for people who are making $22,000 a year to
pay a higher marginal rate on every dollar earned than someone
making $200,000 a year. That's wrong. And I hope this doesn't sound
blase: I don't care what the polls say. It's not going to change my
opinion about what I think should happen. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Q. How different from Bob Dole?
</P>
<P>
   BUSH: It's different because one, I started early, and two,
there's a different budget projection. There's a different budget
picture. I'm still going to have to fight the same thing he fought
with an administration that's desperate to keep the money in
Washington. I mean, Al Gore spends most of the surplus on programs.
That's what he decided to do. Look at his budget numbers. That's
just a difference of opinion. It's a fundamental difference of
opinion. And it's very important for me to make clear that we can
have tax relief and tax reform and make the codes fairer without
affecting anybody's Medicare check.
</P>
<P>
   Q. The nation's economic outlook has changed since you laid your
plan out. The stock market has fallen and inflation is growing.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH: That's another reason to have tax relief.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Does your plan take into account a new reality?
</P>
<P>
   BUSH: It does. Absolutely. That's a reason, if the economy
begins to get shaky. By the way, there's a five and a half year
phase-in. It's going to address an economic slowdown.
</P>
<P>
   To me, it's justifiable on economic grounds, and necessary. All
the more reason to provide tax relief. I hope we don't slow down.
But you're right, it is a little more shaky now, in a brief
five-month period of time.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How critical is your tax plan to winning this election?
</P>
<P>
   BUSH: It's a part of what's critical to my election. What's
critical to my election is a lot of things. One, that people trust
my judgment. Two, that people hear the call for reform. Three, that
people know that I can renew what I call the spirit of America.
Four, that people are comfortable with the types of people that
I'll bring into my administration. Five, whether people are happy
or not with the status quo. I readily concede that if people want
four more years of Clinton-Gore, I've got a tough road. I do. I
know what my position is. I'm the outsider, and I'm the challenger.
I'm coming from outside Washington, and I'm the challenger
candidate. People say, I hear them talking out of Washington, well,
he doesn't have enough experience. As if being the governor of the
second biggest state and having served as a CEO in the private
sector isn't experience. It's a Washington mentality. And I'm going
to have to battle it. I'm fully aware of the odds I'm going to
face.
</P>
<P>
   It's a well thought-out plan. And I'm going to have to battle.
I'm going to have battle with the polls. I'm going to have to
battle with a president who wants to keep the money in Washington.
I'm going to have to battle with a vice president who'll say risky
this, risky that. I understand that. But I believed it when I laid
it out and I believe it while I'm sitting right here today, after
having won some primaries and lost some primaries. This is right
for America.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Q. Has John McCain elevated your consciousness about reform? Has
he changed your views?
</P>
<P>
   BUSH: No, he didn't change my views. He made me a better
candidate. He forced me to play to my strengths better. I needed to
make it more clear that I not only believe in reform, I've got the
record as a chief executive of getting reform done. There's nothing
like the humbling experience of getting whipped pretty bad in New
Hampshire to cause a man to re-evaluate. And I re-evaluated my
message and I re-evaluated how I was conducting myself as a
candidate. I wasn't doing as good a job as I could have explaining
where my strength is. And my strength is as somebody when, giving
the chance to reform, like education, I brought both Republicans
and Democrats together. That's what this country needs, when it
comes to Social Security, for example.
</P>
<P>
   When it's all said and done, I think America's going to turn to
me. I've got a record of doing it. The vice president is extremely
partisan. He's extremely partisan.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Is there anything McCain brought to light for you or changed
your opinion on in any way?
</P>
<P>
   BUSH: No, not really. We agreed more than we disagreed. That's
the great irony. You know, primaries are struggles, arguments over
shades of gray. And that's what makes primaries difficult. In my
case, I've known John a long time. And battling with John wasn't
all that pleasant, because I like him. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do you see healing happen?
</P>
<P>
   BUSH: Yes, I do.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What do you need to do to make sure that happens?
</P>
<P>
   BUSH: Just remind him there's a lot of agreement. We agree on a
lot of things, starting with neither of us wants Al Gore to be the
president.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What about Al Gore's public life do you dislike so much?
</P>
<P>
   BUSH: I don't like the acrimony in Washington. I don't like the
zero-sum politics. I don't like pitting one group of people against
another. I don't like the way they've handled whether or not he
knew about raising money from the White House _ you know, iced tea
and all these kinds of excuses. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Q. You don't have to make concessions, but there are people out
there urging it and calling for it __
</P>
<P>
   BUSH: Who's saying that?
</P>
<P>
   Q. Intermediaries. Is there anything you need to do to win him
over? Any concessions you need to offer?
</P>
<P>
   BUSH: No. I think what I need to do is explain to John that we
agree a lot more than we disagree. There's a lot of room for reform
in Washington, D.C. I look forward to working with him to achieve
the reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Q. You said initially you were going to stay positive in the
campaign. Any regrets about the way the primary went?
</P>
<P>
   BUSH: No, I don't.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do you regret the turn of the whole campaign?
</P>
<P>
   BUSH: I regret being called an anti-Catholic bigot. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Q. You're comfortable with the negative tone?
</P>
<P>
   BUSH: I didn't take the negative tone. The filter took the
negative tone. . . .
</P>
<P>
   The reason that the turnout was so huge is because I talked
about education reform and military reform and rarely did I attack
my opponents. As a matter of fact, I was the person being attacked
most of the time, early on in the primaries, and then coming down
the stretch, I felt I need to project a positive image, and that's
what I did.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How involved are you in the day-to-day decisions of the
campaign?
</P>
<P>
   BUSH: This is important if you're trying to leap from here to
the presidency. I know the difference between being somebody who
sets the vision and sets the tone and enunciates the principles by
which decisions are being made and someone who is a micro-manager.
Being a candidate itself is a lot of work. I can't tell you all the
times when I say I'm not going to give this speech. It happens a
lot. I can be pretty stubborn.
</P>
<P>
   People make suggestions on what to say all the time. I'll give
you an example; I don't read what's handed to me. People say
``Here, here's your speech, or here's an idea for a speech.''
They're changed. Trust me. Last night's a good example. We could
have been a lot harsher in tone on Vice President Gore last night.
I chose not to. What I think is important is not to get mired in a
slugfest with this guy. That's what he wants. And last night one of
the drafts I got was pretty tough. I said I'm not going to talk
about him this way, because I wanted to talk about education.
</P>
<P>
   Q. When you look at some of the situations where the United
States is trying with mixed success to broker peace talks, do you
have sympathy for what Clinton is trying to do or do you blame him?
</P>
<P>
   BUSH: Take Northern Ireland for example. I have been on the
record applauding the efforts to use our prestige to bring people
together. It's very important for Americans and elected officials
to be patient with the peace process. To be diligent and patient.
It's very important for a president not to impose a United States
solution on the peace process. So to the president's credit, it
seems to me on the Middle East he's working hard to bring people
together.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What would you do with the situation in the Balkans?
</P>
<P>
   BUSH: I would have hopefully not gotten us involved in the first
place. I would hope my diplomacy would have allowed there not to
commit troops in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Is it time to turn things completely over to the United
Nations?
</P>
<P>
   BUSH: In the Balkans, I don't think so yet. But I do think it's
time to begin to say to our European allies, you're going to have
to be the peacekeepers. I think it's going to be very important for
us to trim United States involvement around the world from certain
peacekeeping missions.

$500 MILLION RESORT PLANNED ON CONCORD SITE IN CATSKILLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CHARLES V. BAGLI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the first major project since the bungalow colonies and
hotels in the New York state's borscht belt fell on hard times 30
years ago, a developer plans to demolish the legendary Concord
Hotel in the Catskills and build a $500 million resort, with a
hotel and conference center, golf village, spa ranch, entertainment
center and wilderness area.
</P>
<P>
   Louis R. Cappelli, a Westchester County developer who bought the
Concord property on Kiamesha Lake a year ago, said he planned to
begin construction by Labor Day on property of more than 1,600
acres _ twice the size of Central Park. He said that the complex,
90 miles northwest of New York City, would be a year-round
attraction in an area where most of the old hotels have crumbled
and many people work two and three jobs to make ends meet.
</P>
<P>
   Economic pied pipers have appeared before in the Catskill
Mountains with fanciful revival plans that quickly evaporated, but
local political leaders have embraced Cappelli's proposal as a
substantive development that could bring new life to the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very excited to have him here,'' said Rusty Pomeroy,
chairman of the Sullivan County Legislature. ``Once in a while you
get a project that can reposition the area all by itself. If he's
able to do it, it would change the way people perceive Sullivan
County. We're not the borscht belt anymore. We're not a dying,
depressed county.''
</P>
<P>
   Cappelli presented his plans yesterday in Monticello a day after
Gov. George E. Pataki seemed to dash longstanding hopes for another
project, an Indian-run casino at the Monticello Raceway. Pataki has
long said that casinos would provide a much-needed boost for former
resort areas like Monticello. But on Tuesday, he introduced a bill
that would require the state Legislature to approve any Indian
gambling initiative, which proponents say is unlikely to happen.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, Pataki had come under attack by casino
operators from Atlantic City, N.J., and anti-gambling groups in New
York who opposed a planned $500 million casino in Monticello. Some
unions have also criticized Indian-run casinos, which are not bound
by labor or civil rights laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my opinion, the governor is bailing out because he has
national aspirations,'' said Pomeroy, who had supported the casino.
``He acceded to a campaign against him by the Atlantic City gaming
interests. If this goes to the Legislature, the people speculating
on a casino can pack it in. There's too much Donald Trump influence
there.''
</P>
<P>
   The federal Bureau of Indian Affairs and Interior Secretary
Bruce Babbitt are nearing a decision on the proposed casino, which
would be owned by the St. Regis Mohawk tribe. The project also
needs state approval.
</P>
<P>
   Cappelli said his plans were not dependent on the casino, which
had touched off a land boom in Sullivan County in the last two
years. He said the Concord is only 90 minutes northwest of New York
City and within a four-hour drive of 55 million people. The resort,
he said, should attract conventions looking for an 1,100-room hotel
in a rural setting, as well as families looking for a weekend
getaway.

THE AGENDA IN CONNECTICUT'S LEGISLATURE: REFORMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By PAUL ZIELBAUER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ As they hustle through this year's 12-week
legislative session, Connecticut lawmakers on both sides of the
aisle have been tossing around the R-word almost as often as their
parties' candidates for president have.
</P>
<P>
   For Democrats, who control both houses of the General Assembly,
reforming the state's campaign finance laws is a top priority.
Republicans, on the other hand, want reforms in the rules
controlling how the Democratic state treasurer invests the state's
$21 billion pension fund.
</P>
<P>
   And almost halfway through the session, both sides seem to agree
that the state's county sheriff system needs so much reform that it
should simply be abolished.
</P>
<P>
   Neither party has abandoned its core issues. For Democrats,
those include strengthening laws to protect air and water quality;
Republicans are intent on tax cuts, including a 7-cent reduction in
the gasoline tax.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats have seized on campaign finance legislation as the
political hammer with which to pound Republicans, who have been
forced to discuss the issue since Paul J. Silvester, a former state
treasurer and a Republican ally of Gov. John G. Rowland, pleaded
guilty to federal charges of money laundering and racketeering in
September for improperly investing state pension funds in exchange
for political favors or money.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Bill No. 1 would limit campaign spending by each party's
ticket for governor and lieutenant governor to $5 million, and
limit spending by each candidate for the five other statewide
elected offices to $750,000, beginning in 2002. It would also
finance up to half of the money those candidates spend through
voluntary taxpayer donations.
</P>
<P>
   But the bill's most provocative element _ the spending caps on
political campaigns _ has been disparaged as unconstitutional by
many lawmakers in both parties and by the state Elections
Enforcement Commission. A similar bill offered by House Democrats
proposes voluntary spending limits on campaigns for governor and
the five other statewide offices, but not on the 187 campaigns for
state legislative office. The General Assembly's powerful joint
Appropriations Committee is expected to vote on the Senate bill
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans oppose both campaign finance bills. They favor a
third bill, based on recommendations made by the Elections
Enforcement Commission, that would more strictly limit how much
special-interest groups could give candidates. At Thursday's
Judiciary Committee meeting, a group of Senate Republicans plans to
propose amending the two Democratic-sponsored bills to include a
ban on campaign contributions from all political action committees,
unions and corporations.
</P>
<P>
   For Republicans, though, this year's paramount issue is cutting
taxes. As gasoline prices in Connecticut surpass $2 a gallon,
Republican leaders are counting on public sentiment to fight
Democratic opposition to a proposal dear to Rowland: a 7-cent
reduction in the state's 32-cent-a-gallon gasoline tax.
</P>
<P>
   Testifying before the Finance, Revenue and Bonding Committee
last Friday, Marc S. Ryan, the governor's state budget director,
called the gas tax, the highest in the country, ``one of the last
remaining regressive tax structures we have'' and urged the panel
to pass the bill ``so we don't see individuals driving across
borders to purchase gas and other things.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats remain unconvinced, arguing that cutting the gas tax
might not result in lower pump prices and that the $90 million in
potential savings would be better spent on fixing roads and
bridges. But the Democratic co-chairwoman of the committee, state
Rep. Anne McDonald of Stamford, predicted that in an election year
most committee members would vote for the tax cut, despite concerns
about its effect on the state's healthy AA bond rating by Standard
&AMP; Poor's.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it will come to a compromise, where there's a 3- or
4-cent reduction,'' McDonald said in an interview Monday. The
47-member finance committee has until March 28 to vote on the
measure.
</P>
<P>
   Other major items on the agenda this year include legislation
that would force fossil-fuel power plants in Bridgeport, New Haven,
Middletown, Norwalk and Montville to cut their emission levels of
nitrogen and sulfur oxides by 2003. The plants were built before
the 1973 federal Clean Air Act took effect, and emissions at all
five plants exceed current federal standards. A similar bill passed
last June on a 68-67 vote in the state House of Representatives,
but the Assembly's Energy and Technology Committee ignored the
proposal, effectively killing it. The owners of the five power
plants say that if the bill passes and is signed by the governor,
they will be forced to shut down for eight weeks to retool.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans and Democrats both support another environmental
measure to eliminate a chemical additive to gasoline that reduces
toxic tailpipe emissions but that has polluted Connecticut ground
water. Several bills seeking to ban the chemical in gasoline sold
in the state are under discussion in legislative committees.
</P>
<P>
   State officials have sought the cooperation of other
Northeastern states to ban the additive, methyl tertiary butyl
ether, or MTBE. Two weeks ago, Rowland asked the state's
congressional delegation to propose a national policy on the
additive.

RAMPART SCANDAL IN LIMBO AS OFFICIALS FIGHT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG GITTRICH, BETH BARRETT AND RICK ORLOV 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Tension between Los Angeles Police Chief Bernard
C. Parks and District Attorney Gil Garcetti over the Rampart
Division scandal probe exploded into open warfare and personal
attacks Wednesday, leaving critical questions about how - and
whether - they will cooperate unanswered.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Richard Riordan attempted to mediate the dispute, but
Garcetti passed up the meeting and held a news conference to accuse
Parks of obstructing his investigation and refusing to cooperate
with prosecutors - actions he vowed to answer with subpoenas.
</P>
<P>
   Parks responded by accusing Garcetti, who faces a tough
re-election fight after running second in the primary, of political
grandstanding and dragging his feet in prosecuting rogue anti-gang
officers in the Rampart Division.
</P>
<P>
   After meeting with them separately, an angry Riordan publicly
chided both men, telling them to grow up and act like responsible
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't a children's game and the chief of police and
district attorney have been acting like children,'' Riordan said,
tossing aside his prepared remarks and banging his fist on the
podium.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have to start acting like adults and put the city first.
The people of the city have to have confidence in the district
attorney and the chief of police.''
</P>
<P>
   The feud, which has marred the probe for months, inflamed
critics of the LAPD both in and out of City Hall, in large part
because the District Attorney's Office got to put the first spin on
the issue of cooperation by leaking its version of the situation.
</P>
<P>
   Councilwoman Cindy Miscikowski typified the reaction at City
Hall, saying, ``I've never heard of anything like that ... I think
what the chief did was grossly improper.''
</P>
<P>
   Left unclear was whether Parks' plan to use U.S. Attorney
Alejandro N. Mayorkas' office as a clearinghouse for investigative
information to be shared with the District Attorney's Office would
be acceptable to Garcetti.
</P>
<P>
   Parks called Garcetti's claim that the LAPD was freezing the
district attorney out of the investigation ``blatant and false
material.'' He insisted he had more confidence in the U.S.
Attorney's Office than in Garcetti, whose office has only sought
two minor pieces of information in the past month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly have some lack of confidence in their (District
Attorney's Office) ability to deal with this case,'' Parks said at
an evening news conference at the Rampart Division station.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to him personally and explained that the D.A.'s
Office has never been denied any information and never will,
regardless of our frustrations. It makes no difference to me as to
which agency prosecutes the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to Garcetti and his statements, Parks added, ``That is
not an individual who is trying to resolve the issue. This
signifies self-service to us.'' In taking his own frustration
public, Garcetti told a noontime news conference that Parks had no
legal basis for withholding investigative information from his
office.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no legal authority for the chief to thumb his nose at
us and I can't accept it,'' he said. ``I won't tolerate it. We
cannot permit anyone to obstruct our effort of getting to the
bottom of this.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any refusal by the management of the Los Angeles Police
Department to provide investigative reports and investigative
assistance to our prosecutors is unacceptable and contrary to law.
If we do not receive LAPD reports, we will subpoena them, and we'll
subpoena every single officer involved in the Rampart investigation
if necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   On March 8, Parks sent a letter to Garcetti's office to ``advise
and educate'' prosecutors on a process worked out with the U.S.
Attorney's Office to speed up the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Other letters were exchanged between the LAPD, district attorney
and U.S. attorney in the following days, culminating in what
Garcetti said was his conversation with Parks on Tuesday in which
the chief flatly refused to cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   Although the letters from the LAPD never explicitly said
investigative material would be withheld, Garcetti said Parks told
him orally that the LAPD no longer intended to provide either
investigative reports or investigative assistance.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, Garcetti sent a letter stating that the process
Parks proposed was unacceptable - and then he went public with his
version of the dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Parks said he believed that Garcetti, in conference with
Attorney General Bill Lockyer, had as recently as Monday agreed to
protocols that would sort out how the respective agencies would
handle the investigations and prosecutions.
</P>
<P>
   City Attorney James Hahn, whose mayoral campaign, like
Garcetti's re-election campaign, is managed by Bill Carrick,
weighed into the controversy by saying Parks is required by state
law to work with the District Attorney's Office about the Rampart
case.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no authority for a chief of police to refuse
cooperation with a public prosecutor,' Hahn said.
</P>
<P>
   Hahn said he was disturbed by the lack of cooperation caused by
``petty personal differences.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, nerves have been rubbed raw and we are allowing
personalities to get in the way of the truth,'' Hahn said.
</P>
<P>
   After talking with the chief and hearing his explanations, Hahn
said there could have been a misunderstanding, and that the LAPD
intended to cooperate fully with Garcetti's office.
</P>
<P>
   Lockyer, in a statement, also urged cooperation, saying the
D.A.'s Office is the best agency to prosecute cases arising under
state laws, while the U.S. Attorney's Office, with its subpoena
power of the federal grand jury, is better able to prosecute
possible violations under federal civil rights laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of these important resources should join forces to ensure
justice and necessary reform for Los Angeles by sharing information
and coordinating investigative efforts,'' Lockyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Parks has grown increasingly frustrated with Garcetti for not
filing charges against three officers whose cases were referred for
prosecution. Garcetti has not said whether any of the cases was
strong enough to charge, and that he intends to try to develop a
conspiracy case against a larger number of officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the biggest case in Los Angeles in 60 years, and
Garcetti sits on it,'' said one source close to the investigation
and the politics surrounding it. ``Now he's doing damage control.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramona Ripston, executive director of the American Civil
Liberties Union of Southern California, said, ``We have an imperial
chief in Los Angeles. The refusal of Los Angeles Police Chief
Bernard Parks to work with the L.A. County District Attorney's
Office on the Rampart corruption scandal is another reason why it
is essential to appoint an independent commission to examine the
systemic problems in the LAPD. Parks is trying to grab more
authority, rather than be held accountable for his actions and
those of his department.''

USC MOVING ON UP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Chris Gobrecht has been trying to turn around the
women's basketball program at USC for three years, and as recently
as early February, it appeared the Women of Troy were at least one
more season away from even limited success.
</P>
<P>
   The team was struggling with an 8-11 record and seemed destined
for a third straight finish in the lower half of the conference.
</P>
<P>
   It was especially hard on Gobrecht, who took Washington to the
NCAA Tournament nine times.
</P>
<P>
   USC was 19-35 in Gobrecht's first two seasons as head coach and
her competitive nature made it tough to endure the losing, despite
the fact injuries and a talent shortage were primarily responsible
for the losing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had times of being really frustrated. I didn't know what
buttons to push any more,'' Gobrecht said. ``It's not so much you
doubt yourself (but rather) as you're humbled. You realize you
don't have all the answers.''
</P>
<P>
   The past five weeks have almost made up for those trying times,
however, as USC went 7-2 in the second half of Pacific-10
Conference play and earned a bid to the Women's National Invitation
Tournament; it will meet Santa Clara at 7 tonight in a first-round
game at Toso Pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   USC (15-13) was arguably the hottest team in the conference by
the end of the season and possibly just a win away from making the
NCAA Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Among those most surprised by USC's late-season surge is
Gobrecht, considering the Trojans went 3-6 in the first half of the
Pac-10 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't have thought we could go 7-2,'' she said. ``It
allows us to skip straight to our expectations. We have an
understanding of what it's about now. It's time to move up with the
big guys.''
</P>
<P>
   This year's NIT bid is seen as the first small step toward
rebuilding the program.
</P>
<P>
   Although USC loses three players, it has one of the nation'stop
recruiting classes, a class that features center Ebony Hoffman of
Narbone High in Harbor City, rated the No. 2 prospect in the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   USC also signed Aisha Hollans of Berkeley High, whose team will
play against Hoffman's Narbonne team on Saturday in the State
Division I championship game, and guard Ryane Alexander of Copperas
Cove, Texas, USA Today's ninth-ranked team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we feel pretty good about being in position to be one
of the top programs in the Pac-10,'' Gobrecht said.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a turning point for this year's team, it probably
occurred in early February. USC was blown out by California 81-64
in what was unquestionably the low point in the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our loss at Cal, that was an embarrassment,'' said senior
forward Danielle Golay.
</P>
<P>
   USC lost its following game at Stanford 69-59, but the players
believe that close contest boosted their confidence and helped
change the direction of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We grew up a little bit and matured,'' Golay said. ``From a
loss, we actually learned we were getting better.''
</P>
<P>
   After that, USC upset 20th-ranked UCLA, 15th-ranked Arizona and
completed a sweep of Pac-10 champion Oregon with a 69-63 victory at
McArthur Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the beginning of the year, a lot of people were not doing
their part,'' Golay said. ``When that changed, we did win games.
Before you knew it, you looked at our record and it was like `Wow.'
I didn't even know we finished 7-2 until (Gobrecht) told us last
weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   A major reason USC has improved is sophomore guard Tiffany
Elmore, who averaged 8.8 points in the first nine Pac-10 games and
14.2 points in the final nine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like I needed to step up because at the beginning of
the season, I averaged like two points a game,'' Elmore said. ``I
wasn't as confident. There was a lot of stress and things
happening. But all of the hard work has paid off.''

I SING THE PICKUP ELECTRIC  &HT;

We're flying down 101 around Hospital Curve, me and Electric Ray,
passing the internal-combustion losers right and left, and it
occurs to me what Ray's truck lacks:
<P>
   A loudspeaker.
</P>
<P>
   I once drove the Oscar Mayer Weinermobile and it has a
loudspeaker, an enormously handy feature, so much more highly
evolved than the horn. ``Honk'' is like  &LR; aloha,  &LR; it can mean
anything.
</P>
<P>
   Driving Electric Ray's pickup, I feel a need to communicate with
other motorists, although technically I am the only motorist on the
road, since gas cars are powered by  &LR; engines,  &LR; not motors.
</P>
<P>
   I want to say:
</P>
<P>
   ``Attention, blue Chevy! I am the future! Please get out of my
lane and let me through.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yo, white Honda smogmaker, dinosaurs died for your
environmental sins!''
</P>
<P>
   I am driving Ray's Ford Ranger, which is powered by batteries. I
am developing an attitude: greener than thou.
</P>
<P>
   Electric Ray, also known as Ray Levinson, laughed when he read
the headline in Wednesday's newspaper, ``Gas Prices Rise to
Historic Highs.''
</P>
<P>
   And here's a secret memo to you other drivers: Gas prices not
heading south soon.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; READER DAN MILLER &LR;  stopped at a Chevron station on San Jose Ave.
Wednesday and as he was pumping at $1.93 a gallon, an attendant was
changing the signboard to read $1.95.
</P>
<P>
   I'm telling you, smart people know that the $3 gallon is coming,
and they are draining their swimming pools and hot tubs and filling
them with gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   You're paying two bucks a gallon? Electric Ray is using about
two bucks worth of electricity to get the equivalent of a  &LR; full &LR; 
 &LR; tank.  &LR; And if he works it right, he can get charged for free.
</P>
<P>
   The man is stealing transportation. It's the ultimate way to bum
a ride.
</P>
<P>
   Ray can drive up to the front door of the Hyatt Regency at
Fisherman's Wharf, for instance, and tell the valet parking guy,
``Fill 'er up,'' and get a free charge from the Hyatt's charger. He
can charge up at Costco, even at some BART stations.
</P>
<P>
   Ray is the U.S. post office's environmental manager for
California and Hawaii. He has been hammering the P.O. to get
electric vehicles, and he figured he should practice what he
hammers.
</P>
<P>
   So he leased his pickup for $199 a month. His Ranger can range
only about 65 to 70 miles between charges, but other than that ...
no gas, no oil, no transmission fluid, no moving parts. It's a
flashlight on wheels.

   Electric Ray is a former Los Angeles hippie. He went to work for
the post office because they hired freaky guys with long hair. He
rose through the ranks and is now Mr. Environment.
</P>
<P>
   Ray's hair is short now, but he still listens to his inner
hippie. His home has special watt-saving bulbs and bamboo flooring
(it's a grass; save the trees), and he composts.
</P>
<P>
   He has persuade the post office to order 500 EVs (electric
vehicles) from Ford. He became such a pest on the subject that his
co-workers call him Electric Ray.
</P>
<P>
   He is going to wind up on Saddam Hussein's hit list. One-third
of all U.S. oil consumption is for transportation, and the Mideast
oil boys need us to need them.
</P>
<P>
   Ray's truck is like a UFO. The motor (not an engine, please) is
stone silent. It's eerie. If you have some kind of need for stealth
driving, this is your ride.

   WASHINGTON _ U.S. troops in Kosovo carried out raids on the
strongholds of ethnic Albanian guerrillas Wednesday, capturing
bombs and other weapons in the largest effort to date by U.S.
forces there to end the guerrillas' threat to the NATO-led
peacekeeping mission, U.S. officials said.
</P>
<P>
   No one was reported injured in the raids, which were conducted
in villages and guerrilla posts in the eastern sector of Kosovo,
where the bulk of the nearly 6,000 U.S. troops in the territory are
stationed. It was unclear if the U.S. troops fired their weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The raids came a day after a senior Pentagon official told
reporters here that the situation in Kosovo was deteriorating
quickly and that U.S. troops in Kosovo might end up in armed
conflict with the Albanian guerrillas, who were supposed to have
disarmed under terms of a cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials said the raids were an effort to stop the
guerrillas from using the U.S.-patrolled sector of Kosovo as a
launching area for cross-border strikes on Serbia, which in turn
threaten to provoke clashes between the United States and
well-armed Serbian forces under the control of Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Fresh violence was also reported Wednesday in the divided Kosovo
town of Kosovska-Mitrovica, where Serbs have called for a campaign
of civil disobedience against the embattled U.N. and NATO
administration.
</P>
<P>
   French peacekeepers in Mitrovica clashed with Serbian
protesters, with at least 15 Serbs reported injured.
</P>
<P>
   The capture of Albanian bombs and other weapons by the U.S.
troops will likely provide fresh rhetorical ammunition to
Milosevic, who has accused the United Nations and NATO of aiding
Albanian terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of using their authority and impartiality to restrain
terrorist gangs of Albanian extremists, we face the situation in
which the terrorism is taking place under their auspices, and even
being financed by United Nations means,'' Agence France-Presse
quoted Milosevic as saying Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   NATO announced the addition of more than 1,000 additional troops
in Kosovo to buttress its forces.
</P>
<P>
   The new troops _ 700 French and 400 Italian soldiers _ would
reinforce the security forces in Mitrovica, scene of the most
serious violence in recent weeks, NATO officials said.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday French troops tried to set up a secure zone around
one of the bridges that divide the city and ordered the
self-appointed Serbian guardians of the bridge to leave their
positions. The Serbs, who prevent Albanians from crossing the
bridge into the northern Serbian-dominated part of the city, left.
But an angry crowd of 300 people rapidly formed.
</P>
<P>
   Troops dispersed the crowd with tear gas and percussion
grenades. The Serbs said the grenades injured up to 15 people. The
Serbs then attacked Western journalists and were barely prevented
from lynching an elderly Albanian man in his apartment. French
paratroopers in armored vehicles rescued him, and he was bleeding
as the troops struggled to carry him through the lunging, pushing
crowd.
</P>
<P>
   The anger in the streets of the town was palpable. The so-called
bridge guardians were young tough men with walkie-talkies. Serbs
said the force is necessary to prevent Albanians from attacking the
Serbs and forcing them to flee the city, as they have elsewhere in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright sternly
warned ethnic Albanian leaders that the United States and other
NATO peacekeepers were determined to defend the border against
crossborder attacks on Serbian police. She told a congressional
panel on Wednesday that the Albanians ``are in danger of losing our
support'' if the provocations continued.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is especially concerned about armed bands of
Albanians roaming the rugged Presevo Valley, seeking to launch
strikes against Serb forces just across the nearby border. While
condemning the actions of the Albanian guerrilla leaders, Albright
said that ``the large majority of Kosovar Albanians are trying to
put their lives together.''

EVEN AT `60 PERCENT,' STARS BEAT THE DEVILS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Recordwise, the St. Louis Blues are the
best team in the Western Conference. The numbers similarly point to
the New Jersey Devils as the best team in the Eastern Conference.
</P>
<P>
   But after the past four days, the Stars showed they might be the
best team in either conference.
</P>
<P>
   Want evidence?
</P>
<P>
   The Stars finished a string of three games in four nights,
playing without their starting goalie in all of them, with a 3-2
victory against the previously mentioned Devils last night at
Continental Airlines Arena. In the other two games, the Stars
defeated the previously mentioned St. Louis Blues and the New York
Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole year, everything this team has done and gone
through, it speaks for itself to be in the position we are, to have
done the things that we've done and to be where we are with all the
injuries and turmoil,'' Stars winger Brett Hull said. ``It's some
big wins against some good teams.''
</P>
<P>
   And with players such as Guy Carbonneau, Jere Lehtinen and Blake
Sloan yet to return, they aren't even operating at 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
   If the Stars are indeed operating at 60 percent, as Stars coach
Ken Hitchcock suggested after watching his injury-riddled bunch
defeat a much-hyped Devils bunch that had just added sniper
Alexander Mogilny, the NHL had better watch out.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he says that, then I'm not going to argue with him. It's
like beating a dead horse,'' Stars winger Mike Keane said, coyly.
``We want to try to get healthy again. It's tough to tell how good
we are or how bad we are. We haven't had a full team.''
</P>
<P>
   A Stars bunch firing at 100 percent might be too much to handle.
Just ask New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   The game-winning goal came from ... who else? Mike Modano. He
extended his point streak to a personal-best 11 games with his goal
at 5:50 of the third period. It was one of his five shots on the
night. In addition, he played 22-plus minutes, won 58 percent of
his faceoffs and finished a game-high plus-2. ``When he scored, the
whole building went silent,'' Stars goalie Manny Fernandez said.
</P>
<P>
   And while Modano has been good, the Stars around him have been
pretty good themselves. The Jon Sims and Roman Lyashenkos and
Brenden Morrows have come into their own.
</P>
<P>
   OK, Fernandez has, too.
</P>
<P>
   Playing in his fifth consecutive game in relief of usual starter
Ed Belfour Fernandez has ``really'' come into his own. Last night,
he stopped 22 of the 24 shots he faced, including a flurry in front
of his net in the final 10 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he was good. This kid has got a lot of confidence
right now,'' Hitchcock said. ``We come here, and we beat St. Louis,
and we beat these guys, and we beat the Rangers, in the last three
games. That's a heck of a way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   And with Belfour likely to be in net Saturday in Chicago, the
Stars more than weathered the storm without him. They went 3-1-1,
earning eight of a possible 10 points during the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   Last night's game looked as if it was going to be easy. The
Stars were flying in the opening minutes, and a little four-on-four
play courtesy of a couple of penalties did nothing to slow them
down. By the time the four-on-four had expired, the Stars had a 2-0
lead courtesy of goals by winger Jamie Langenbrunner at 2:40 and
defenseman Richard Matvichuk 35 seconds later.
</P>
<P>
   But the Devils answered with two goals of their own. First,
winger Patrik Elias scored a power-play goal at 15:24 of the first
period. Then, center Jason Arnott scored at 5:51 of the second
period.
</P>
<P>
   And it wouldn't be a Stars game without one of their players
being helped off the ice. Matvichuk had a puck deflected into his
forehead 3 minutes, 42 seconds into the third period. Hitchcock
said Matvichuk is all right, but he didn't return to the game. The
Stars scored two minutes later.
</P>
<P>
   Adversity, you see, prompts the Stars to their best
performances. They've been dealing with it all season, and that,
Hitchcock says, might be why they are where they are now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our element, our strength is our attitude right now,''
Hitchcock said. ``Our attitude is very strong. We have a lot of
mental toughness in this group.'' \Ntagtop:Jennifer Floyd, (817)

AIDS POLICY CHIEF CAUTIONS THAT EPIDEMIC ISN'T OVER  &HT;       
  
</HEADLINE>
   By David Perlman 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
SAN FRANCISCO _ Warning that complacency over the AIDS epidemic is
mounting in America, President Clinton's AIDS policy chief called
Wednesday for swift renewal of the law that provides millions of
dollars to care for needy patients with the deadly infection.
<P>
   ``Far too many policymakers yearn to believe that the worst is
behind us,'' said Sandra L. Thurman, director of the White House
Office of National AIDS Policy. ``But the sobering truth is that
this pandemic is far from over. In fact, it is just beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   Thurman was the major speaker Wednesday at the opening of the
12th National HIV/AIDS Update Conference, an annual meeting in San
Francisco where AIDS advocacy groups, patient care workers,
physicians and researchers gather to share the latest information
on progress in therapy and prevention.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law, known as the Ryan White Care Act, now provides more
than $1.6 billion a year for medical care for the poorest AIDS
patients. Passed 10 years ago and named for an Indiana boy with
hemophilia who campaigned for public understanding of the disease,
the act will expire this year unless it is renewed by Congress
within the next two months.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has already sought an additional $1.6 billion
in federal funds for AIDS research and $700 million to find and
apply the most effective prevention methods in the most hard-hit
communities, Thurman said.
</P>
<P>
   One of these is to end the federal ban on needle exchange, which
Thurman agreed has been proved as a method for curbing the spread
of AIDS among injection drug users.
</P>
<P>
   ``The blinding ignorance born of racism, sexism and homophobia
still feeds this epidemic,'' Thurman said. ``And we know that as
AIDS continues its march more deeply into poor communities, drug
use puts a growing number at risk and makes the dialogue related to
needle exchange all the more important.''
</P>
<P>
   As she called on AIDS groups to push harder for the renewal of
the Ryan White Act, Thurman said the nonpartisan measure has been
hugely successful.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has created a continuum of care that is both compassionate
and cost-effective _ one that saves both lives and money,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of AIDS16 (49925 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Last year alone, Thurman said, the Ryan White act helped provide
the latest drug therapy to more than 100,000 poor people living
with HIV infections and AIDS, and has served an estimated 500,000
people with other forms of care _ more than 60 percent of them
poor.
</P>
<P>
   The act, she said, has cut the length of costly hospital care
for AIDS patients by at least 30 percent, reduced AIDS mortality by
70 percent and curbed mother-to-child transmission of the AIDS
virus during childbirth by 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But the epidemic's disastrous effects are still falling
disproportionately on the poor, women, minorities and drug addicts,
Thurman said. The number of deaths from AIDS in the United States,
for example, is declining three times faster for men than for
women, and three times faster among white men and women than for
African Americans. And while racial and ethnic minorities make up
one-quarter of the U.S. population, they account for more than half
of all AIDS cases and a growing proportion of new infections by
HIV, the AIDS virus.
</P>
<P>
   ``And though we have made progress in reducing infections and
deaths among the larger gay community,'' Thurman said, ``we know
that for young gay men _ and particularly young gay men of color _
the epidemic is getting worse, not better.''
</P>
<P>
   The AIDS Update Conference, sponsored by the American Foundation
for AIDS Research, will continue through Friday, with intensive
workshops focusing on virtually all the problems affecting people
with AIDS or HIV infection.

PRIVATELY RUN JUVENILE PRISON IS ASSAILED FOR ABUSES OF 6 INMATES 
</HEADLINE>
   (INSERTS new graf after 13th graf to note judge's visit to prison
and hearings; CORRECTS attribution in penultimate graf.) 
(bl)  
 By FOX BUTTERFIELD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A state judge in New Orleans has removed six teen-age boys from
a juvenile prison after finding they had been brutalized by guards,
kept in solitary confinement for months for no reason and deprived
of shoes, blankets, education and medical care.
</P>
<P>
   The descriptions of conditions at the prison in Jena, in central
Louisiana, are stark. But the criticism is particularly troubling,
say federal officials and lawyers for the prisoners, because the
prison is run by Wackenhut Corrections Corp., the world's largest
for-profit prison operator. The judge said the company, which
generally has a good reputation in the industry, had treated the
youths no better than animals.
</P>
<P>
   The teen-age inmates were freed or transferred to other prisons
by Judge Mark Doherty of Orleans Parish Juvenile Court, who said
that the boys had been entrusted to Jena's personnel ``for the
avowed purpose of rehabilitation.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Doherty said, they ``wound up in a place that drives
and treats juveniles as if they walked on all fours. These young
people deserve to be treated like human beings, not animals.''
</P>
<P>
   Doherty, a Republican and former prosecutor, said he would
devote the next two weeks to hearings for 12 other boys he has
sentenced who are at Jena to determine whether he can also remove
them.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department officials and others said the problems at
Jena were at least partly caused by Wackenhut's efforts to cut
costs. Consultants for the department and a federal judge found the
company had stinted on food, clothing, education, and medical
treatment for 276 inmates, and on training for guards.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department sent experts to Jena as a result of an
investigation it has mounted in recent years into widespread
reports of abuses in Louisiana's other juvenile prisons.
Additionally, Judge Frank J. Polozola of U.S. District Court in
Baton Rouge has overseen conditions in jails and prisons throughout
the state for more than a decade following lawsuits on behalf of
inmates.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Wackenhut said it was ``disappointed'' by the
Justice Department's charges about Jena. The criticisms, the
company said, were overstated and ignored progress it had made
toward resolving problems at the prison. ``The bottom line is that
the juvenile facility at Jena is a well-managed and safe
facility,'' Wackenhut said.
</P>
<P>
   Other private prisons across the country have drawn official
criticism. But most of those have been run by smaller companies set
up in recent years, as the nation's prison-building boom has
fostered new growth for the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Wackenhut, based in Palm Beach Gardens, Fla., operates 39,308
beds in 56 facilities in 13 states and seven foreign countries; its
shares trade on the New York Stock Exchange. The reports do not
make clear whether top officials at Wackenhut knew about the
problems at Jena.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Private prison operators like Wackhenhut say they can make money
by applying better management skills than government. On its Web
site, Wackenhut says it ``insists that each of its facilities is a
model of modern correctional management.''
</P>
<P>
   But a report in February by four experts hired by the Justice
Department concluded that the problems at Jena ``seemed to be
linked to the reluctance of Wackenhut Corrections to spend adequate
funds to provide for the care of the youth.''
</P>
<P>
   And John Whitely, a former warden of the Louisiana state
penitentiary at Angola who examined the Jena prison for for
Polozola, said the pervasive lack of shoes, underwear, blankets and
mattresses for inmates was ``just cheap.''
</P>
<P>
   After reading the reports, Doherty went to Jena himself and
interviewed inmates. He also conducted hearings of his own to
determine the facts of cases involving youths sentenced in his
court.
</P>
<P>
   Doherty said one boy he released, a 17-year-old found guilty of
robbery, had been repeatedly forced to lie on the floor on his
stomach with a guard's knee in his back, which caused excruciating
pain since the boy had recently had an operation for gunshot wounds
in his abdomen and was wearing a colostomy bag.
</P>
<P>
   A Justice Department official said the government had given
Wackenhut and the Louisiana Department of Corrections a proposal
for immediate improvements at Jena.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are waiting to hear back from them, but the window is
short,'' the official said, indicating that the Justice Department
was considering a lawsuit against Wackenhut if the changes are not
made quickly.
</P>
<P>
   As is often the case in Louisiana, the Jena prison is also
enmeshed in a political corruption scandal. A friend of former Gov.
Edwin W. Edwards, Cecil Brown, was indicted in November in federal
c in New Orleans for funneling $845,000 in cash from Fred Hofheinz,
a former mayor of Houston, to Edwards for the contract to build the
prison at Jena.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards was named as an unindicted co-conspirator in the case,
said Eddie Jordan Jr., the U.S. attorney in New Orleans. Edwards is
now on trial in federal court in Baton Rouge for extortion,
racketeering and money-laundering in connection with the award of a
riverboat casino license. Jordan has said that given the casino
case, it would have been ``superfluous'' to indict Edwards for the
Jena payoffs.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Though Hofheinz won the Jena contract, he was unable to raise
the money to build the $12 million prison and sold the rights to
Wackenhut.
</P>
<P>
   Before the prison opened 14 months ago near the isolated town of
Jena about 100 miles northwest of Baton Rouge, Wackenhut and state
officials had maintained it was being built to provide treatment
for juveniles with drug addictions. But the Justice Department
experts said they found virtually no drug treatment programs at
Jena.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they found ``a dangerous place to be,'' with a quarter
of the inmates ``traumatically injured'' in a two-month period,
many by untrained guards. Those guards, the experts said, routinely
threw the inmates against walls, twisted their arms or shoved them
to the ground because they had not been taught other ways to
control the boys.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Nancy Ray, an author of the report, said many boys had no
shoes or jackets in the winter; some were forced to spend the day
``huddled under a shared sheet or blanket'' to keep warm, rather
than attend classes held in another building.
</P>
<P>
   Inmates often went days without clean underwear, she said, and
sometimes fought over newly washed clothes. Once, she said, inmates
started a riot by rushing a food cart because of a shortage of
food.
</P>
<P>
   Low pay and poor management at Jena, Ray said, have led to high
turnover in personnel: five wardens since Jena has been open, and
600 persons have filled its 180 staff positions. Because of Jena's
remote location, qualified personnel has been difficult to obtain,
Ray said.
</P>
<P>
   She said Wackenhut had skipped some elementary procedures like
background checks on prospective employees for criminal records;
some guards were hired despite having arrest records for assault.
</P>
<P>
   In his report, Whitely found some guards who walked off their
posts, leaving the inmates in control of their barracks while the
boys frequently slept through what few classes were offered. Even
one of the wardens told Whitely that Jena was ``a comedy of
errors.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to wonder if Curley, Larry and Moe were in charge,''
Whitely wrote.
</P>
<P>
   A quarter of the inmates have IQs of less than 70, Ray said, but
no special education is provided for them. Additionally, the
guards, most of whom were white, frequently used racial epithets in
talking to the inmates, who were predominantly black, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
   A 15-year-old inmate from New Orleans also released by Doherty
tried to commit suicide 20 times by swallowing razor blades or
hanging himself by a sheet, the inmate said in an interview. David
Utter, the inmate's lawyer, said that Jena's files contained nearly
two dozen reports that guards had used physical force against the
teen-ager resulting in broken fingers and a broken wrist.
</P>
<P>
   The teen-ager, whose name cannot be used because he is a
juvenile, said he learned about Wackenhut one day when he was in
the visitors room awaiting an appointment with his lawyer and read
a promotional brochure. ``Then I figured out,'' he said,
``Wackenhut was using us kids to make money.''

HIGH-TECH FIRMS PUSH FOR CHINA TRADE BILL  &HT;       
  
</HEADLINE>
   By CAROLYN LOCHHEAD  
 c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
WASHINGTON _ Top California semiconductor makers said Wednesday
that failure by Congress to normalize trade with China would be
tantamount to ``open season'' on U.S. companies by foreign
competitors.
<P>
   Not normalizing relations would lock high-tech companies out of
market-opening measures China negotiated with the Clinton
administration and grant those benefits instead to competitors in
Europe and Southeast Asia, business leaders said.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Barrett, chief executive officer of Intel Corp., John
Dickson, president of Lucent Technologies, and T.J. Rodgers, chief
executive of Cypress Semiconductor, said a ``no'' vote by Congress
could hurt the high-tech industry in one of the world's
fastest-growing markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't want to be up against a structural disadvantage
in the world's largest market'' against competitors in Japan,
Korea, and elsewhere, said Barrett.
</P>
<P>
   Executives conceded, however, that they face an uphill struggle
to approve legislation President Clinton submitted last week to
grant permanent normal trade relations with China as part of
China's expected entry into the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Unions, consumer activists and environmental groups are waging
an all-out drive to defeat the measure, arguing that China's poor
record on labor and human rights should not be rewarded with U.S.
trade concessions.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides are escalating the stakes in what is turning into an
explosive election-year battle on Capitol Hill. Unions are exerting
tremendous pressure on wavering Democrats, while industry is making
it equally clear that the China vote is not one they will forget.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore this week said he would lobby Congress to
normalize trade relations with Beijing. His support had been in
doubt because unions are major backers of his presidential
candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``A vote against this is a vote against high tech and it's a
vote against high-tech jobs in California,'' said Michael Maibach,
Intel's head of government affairs.
</P>
<P>
   In return for U.S. approval of China's WTO entry, the
administration last November secured a huge market-opening trade
pact with China that would slash Chinese tariffs and other market
barriers across key industries, from telecommunications and
Internet investment to automobiles and agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   But once China enters the WTO _ as it is expected to do
regardless of any action by Congress _ WTO rules require that all
member nations trade on equal terms with each other. If Congress
refuses to normalize trade with China, instead leaving it
contingent as it is now on annual congressional approval, China
could, under WTO rules, refuse to grant the same market access to
U.S. companies that it gives to everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese officials have threatened to do just that if Congress
fails to approve permanent normal trade relations.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, under WTO rules, China would be required to grant other
countries the market-access measures it negotiated with the United
States, even if it excluded U.S. companies.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents called the argument ``self-serving nonsense,''
contending that China needs the U.S. market _ which comprises 41
percent of China's total exports _ even more than U.S. companies
need China's.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. for all intents and purposes is China's export
market,'' said Scott Nova, director of the Citizens Trade Campaign,
a coalition of unions, consumer activist groups and environmental
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-San Francisco, said that China has
repeatedly broken its commitments in the past, and first should
have to demonstrate that it will live up to the new trade
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   China has broken a raft of agreements on everything from prison
labor to intellectual property protection to weapons proliferation,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why everybody is in this big rush ... to squander
all of our leverage for products made in America in order to
accommodate our preeminent products, which would be competitive in
any international arena under any circumstances,'' Pelosi added.
</P>
<P>
   But other U.S. industries would face similar problems if
relations are not normalized, said Rep. Cal Dooley, a Kings County
Democrat pushing hard for normalizing trade with China.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to be a rocket scientist to understand,''
Dooley said, ``that if China has the choice to import grain from
Canada or the U.S., when the U.S. is going to have a 40 percent
tariff versus 12 percent for Canada, it's pretty clear who's going
to get the deal, and it's not going to be U.S. farmers.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Regulators in New York state, the nation's largest
banking center and an industry pace setter, are devising new rules
to crack down on lenders who impose exorbitant fees that force
countless homeowners into foreclosure and bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   The abuses at issue are the underbelly of the lucrative $280
billion national market in loans for people with limited income or
poor credit histories, so-called subprime borrowers. Although such
loans charge higher interest rates, they have been a godsend to
many people who otherwise might not get financing.
</P>
<P>
   But some unscrupulous operators seek out unsophisticated
clients, typically elderly or minority homeowners or first-time
buyers in poor areas. They talk the victims into refinancing or
applying for other loans saddled with excessive interest and fees.
The lenders and brokers collect their fees up front. If the
borrower falls in arrears, the mortgage holder seizes the house.
</P>
<P>
   With action on the issue apparently stalled in Congress, the New
York State Banking Board is flexing its powers to license and
oversee mortgage bankers and brokers.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George Pataki, who appoints the board, ordered it to take
up the issue last year after an investigation of a major lender,
Delta Funding, by Attorney General Eliot Spitzer. Pataki was stung
by Spitzer's suggestion that his regulators had gone easy on Delta.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The final regulations, which would apply to so-called high-cost
home loans, are expected to win the board's unanimous support in
the next several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope it will become a model for similar regulation and
legislation in other states and on a nationwide basis,'' said
Elizabeth McCaul, the acting superintendent of banks and the
board's chairwoman. ``We want to end abusive practices, but we
don't want to inadvertently cut off access to credit in those
communities where we are trying to create more access.''
</P>
<P>
   The regulations would make impose several new standards.
</P>
<P>
   _ Defining high-cost loans as those that charge interest more
than eight percentage points above the comparable U.S. Treasury
rate, or up-front fees greater than five points on a loan (a point
is 1 percent of the total loan amount). For second mortgages and
other home loans, the threshold would be nine percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   _ Requiring lenders to consider borrowers' ability to repay and
notify them that impartial credit counseling is available.
</P>
<P>
   _ Banning negative amortization (in which the principal grows),
balloon payments before seven years and higher-interest penalties
after a default.
</P>
<P>
   _ Limiting certain fees and points to 5 percent of the loan.
</P>
<P>
   _ Prohibiting the ``packing'' of certain insurance and other
costs into the loan, the ``flipping'' of loans by refinancing at
excessively higher costs, the charging of bogus fees for services
not rendered and unfair mandatory arbitration.
</P>
<P>
   While McCaul said the proposals had broad support from the
public and the lending industry, consumer groups say the plan does
not go far enough. A joint statement from 70 groups and 12 elected
officials last month said the proposal ``leaves serious and glaring
loopholes what would allow creative lenders and brokers, in too
many instances, to continue their predatory practices as usual.''
</P>
<P>
   Those endorsing the statement included the American Association
of Retired Persons; New York Public Interest Research Group;
Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, known as
Acorn; Harlem Consumer Education Council; and Greater Rochester
Community Reinvestment Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   ``All eyes are on the New York State Banking Department,'' said
Sarah Ludwig, a leader of a statewide coalition of groups against
predatory lending. ``The whole country is watching. It's a huge
problem, and they've got to get this right. What's clear is they're
not really serious about putting the screws to this industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Lending-industry leaders, worried that that a few disreputable
lenders are tainting the rest, say they want the abuses stopped.
But they caution that overly stringent rules would hamper
legitimate lenders and curtail access to loans for people who need
them.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's one bad actor, it puts a black eye on the entire
industry,'' said Robert S. Lotstein, counsel to the National
Association of Mortgage Brokers, which has 12,000 members. ``We are
certainly against predatory lending, but if we need any additional
safeguards, they should be narrowly tailored so that we don't throw
the baby out with the bath water.''
</P>
<P>
   And Stephen A. O'Connor, director for residential financing for
the Mortgage Bankers Association of America, which has 3,000
members, said: ``New York is a bellwether state. Whatever they do
is often copied or emulated.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Other states are also considering action: bills have been filed
this year in the legislatures of California, Illinois, Maryland,
Minnesota, Missouri and South Carolina. The industry warns that a
state-by-state hodgepodge of 50 systems would hinder lenders and
drive up costs.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``We would much prefer uniformity to a patchwork,'' Lotstein
said.
</P>
<P>
   The subprime lending market exploded after Congress changed the
banking laws in the 1980s in an effort to help the battered savings
and loan industry. The pressure for new regulations stems from a
surge of complaints about loan abuses by a number of lenders. One
high-profile company, First Alliance, a national company with four
offices in New York state, has been under investigation by the
federal Justice Department and regulators in seven states,
including New York. The New York banking board formulated its
proposals before an article in The New York Times and a report on
the ABC News program ``20/20'' Wednesday about the practices of
First Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   The only state that has enacted rules against predatory lending
so far is North Carolina, under a law passed last year in a
compromise reached by consumer groups, some industry groups and
government officials. Consumer advocates in New York say that North
Carolina's version is a far stricter and better precedent than the
proposal pending in New York.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina, a major banking state, is home to BankAmerica,
First Union and Wachovia. Since the law is still being phased in,
it is too early to judge the effect, although Alan S. Hirsch, a
deputy to Attorney General Michael F. Easley, a leading proponent,
said: `It's very plain to us that all the major lenders can live
with this.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lotstein said, ``We've had clients who have decided it's
just not desirable to do business there anymore, and some have
turned in their licenses.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In New York state, consumer groups say, the regulators have
already yielded to industry criticism and have ignored the
revisions they urged.
</P>
<P>
   Ludwig said the coalition wants the rules to bar common devices
like the financing of all points and fees, penalties for paying off
a loan early, the financing of insurance charges paid years in
advance, all balloon payments and all mandatory arbitration.
</P>
<P>
   The critics also say that the regulations should require
stricter review of a borrower's ability to repay and put greater
limits on the frequency of refinancing and on the use of so-called
discount points.
</P>
<P>
   ``The proposed regulations simply overlook too many victims of
predatory lending,'' said an Acorn member, Gloria Waldron of East
New York, Brooklyn. ``Almost no cases we've seen would even fall
under their definition of high-cost loans.''
</P>
<P>
   Abuses take many forms, beginning with deceptive advertising of
``free money'' and high-pressure sales pitches. In Brooklyn,
unethical brokers comb through court records to find homeowners
already facing foreclosure. The brokers talk the owners into new
loans that save their homes temporarily but sink them deeper into
debt as the operators strip out the remaining equity to pay their
excessive fees.
</P>
<P>
   Some lenders have even preyed on homeowners who have been
declared mentally incompetent.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the loans start with shady home improvement contractors.
</P>
<P>
   Acorn cited a couple in Port Jefferson Station on Long Island
who missed a payment and found their interest rate jacked up, to 24
percent from 14. In Brooklyn, a woman told a lender she had lost
her $8,000-a-year job as a home health aide, but it approved a loan
anyway, falsely listing her with a $50,000 salary. Another woman
learned too late that her $45,000 loan required monthly payments of
$500 for 15 years _ $90,000 total _ yet left her owing a balloon
payment of $41,000.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is worst in minority neighborhoods that have been
neglected because of ``redlining'' by more traditional, lower-cost
lenders, critics say. Subprime lenders fill that vacuum. In New
York City, the legacy of predatory abuses has been a proliferation
of foreclosures that community advocates say is devastating central
Brooklyn and southeastern Queens.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblywoman Barbara M. Clark, D-Queens, has proposed a bill
that would create protections beyond the proposed banking board
regulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen people losing their homes outright as a result of
home improvement or debt consolidation loans,'' Clark said.
``They're putting their homes on the line and don't know what
they're getting into, with fees and interest that are just off the
scale.''
</P>
<P>
   Her bill would entitle homeowners to cite an improper loan as a
legal defense to prevent foreclosure. It would also cap brokers'
fees at 3 percent, require disclosure of finder's fees that lenders
pay to home improvement contractors for recruiting borrowers, and
hold bankers responsible for the brokers they deal with.
</P>
<P>
   The bill passed several committees last year but did not reach
the Assembly floor. Sen. Frank Padavan, R-Queens, has sponsored the
Senate version.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody needs to do something,'' said Brenda J. Thompson, a
school teacher in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, who said she was
victimized by a subprime lender.
</P>
<P>
   After inheriting her mother's brownstone, which had a small
mortgage with a monthly payment of $154, she talked to a contractor
and lender about renovations. But she was upset when crews tore out
walls without her approval or a loan being issued.
</P>
<P>
   So she went to another lender, who seemed sympathetic and
referred her to a new contractor. He was charming but overcharged
her with a $70,000 fee, took an additional $6,000 of her money and
did incomplete and shabby work, she said.
</P>
<P>
   She was left with a $105,000 loan at 10.9 percent with a $1,002
monthly payment and a balloon balance.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did a job on me, all right,'' Johnson said.

U.S. TROOPS RAID GUERRILLA STRONGHOLDS IN KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ U.S. troops in Kosovo carried out raids on the
strongholds of ethnic Albanian guerrillas Wednesday, capturing
bombs and other weapons in the largest effort to date by U.S.
forces there to end the guerrillas' threat to the NATO-led
peacekeeping mission, U.S. officials said.
</P>
<P>
   No one was reported injured in the raids, which were conducted
in villages and guerrilla posts in the eastern sector of Kosovo,
where the bulk of the nearly 6,000 U.S. troops in the territory are
stationed. It was unclear if the U.S. troops fired their weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The raids came a day after a senior Pentagon official told
reporters here that the situation in Kosovo was deteriorating
quickly and that U.S. troops in Kosovo might end up in armed
conflict with the Albanian guerrillas, who were supposed to have
disarmed under terms of a cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials said the raids were an effort to stop the
guerrillas from using the U.S.-patrolled sector of Kosovo as a
launching area for cross-border strikes on Serbia, which in turn
threaten to provoke clashes between the United States and
well-armed Serbian forces under the control of Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Fresh violence was also reported Wednesday in the divided Kosovo
town of Kosovska-Mitrovica, where Serbs have called for a campaign
of civil disobedience against the embattled U.N. and NATO
administration.
</P>
<P>
   French peacekeepers in Mitrovica clashed with Serbian
protesters, with at least 15 Serbs reported injured.
</P>
<P>
   The capture of Albanian bombs and other weapons by the U.S.
troops will likely provide fresh rhetorical ammunition to
Milosevic, who has accused the United Nations and NATO of aiding
Albanian terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of using their authority and impartiality to restrain
terrorist gangs of Albanian extremists, we face the situation in
which the terrorism is taking place under their auspices, and even
being financed by United Nations means,'' Agence France-Presse
quoted Milosevic as saying Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   NATO announced the addition of more than 1,000 additional troops
in Kosovo to buttress its forces.
</P>
<P>
   The new troops _ 700 French and 400 Italian soldiers _ would
reinforce the security forces in Mitrovica, scene of the most
serious violence in recent weeks, NATO officials said.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday French troops tried to set up a secure zone around
one of the bridges that divide the city and ordered the
self-appointed Serbian guardians of the bridge to leave their
positions. The Serbs, who prevent Albanians from crossing the
bridge into the northern Serbian-dominated part of the city, left.
But an angry crowd of 300 people rapidly formed.
</P>
<P>
   Troops dispersed the crowd with tear gas and percussion
grenades. The Serbs said the grenades injured up to 15 people. The
Serbs then attacked Western journalists and were barely prevented
from lynching an elderly Albanian man in his apartment. French
paratroopers in armored vehicles rescued him, and he was bleeding
as the troops struggled to carry him through the lunging, pushing
crowd.
</P>
<P>
   The anger in the streets of the town was palpable. The so-called
bridge guardians were young tough men with walkie-talkies. Serbs
said the force is necessary to prevent Albanians from attacking the
Serbs and forcing them to flee the city, as they have elsewhere in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright sternly
warned ethnic Albanian leaders that the United States and other
NATO peacekeepers were determined to defend the border against
crossborder attacks on Serbian police. She told a congressional
panel on Wednesday that the Albanians ``are in danger of losing our
support'' if the provocations continued.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is especially concerned about armed bands of
Albanians roaming the rugged Presevo Valley, seeking to launch
strikes against Serb forces just across the nearby border. While
condemning the actions of the Albanian guerrilla leaders, Albright
said that ``the large majority of Kosovar Albanians are trying to
put their lives together.''

SIMILARITIES WITH 1980 RUNNERS-UP ARE EERIE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; MINNEAPOLIS _ This has happened before. The sloppiness and
inconsistency, the midseason slump, the microscopic NCAA hopes, the
fast finish, the Bay Area sweep, the upset of a No. 1 team _ it's
all happened before.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago this month, under rookie coach Larry Brown, the
UCLA Bruins sneaked into the NCAA Tournament, stunned No. 1 DePaul
and eventually lost to Louisville in the championship game.
</P>
<P>
   Can these Bruins do the same?
</P>
<P>
   They open NCAA Tournament play tonight against Ball State.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of similarities, not so much in the teams but
in the seasons,'' said UCLA assistant Michael Holton, who was the
starting point guard in 1980. ``I remember that in the second half
of league play, we said, `Hey, we've just got to get in the NCAA
Tournament.' Then we got in and we thought, `OK, that's it. Here we
go.'
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what this team feels. We know the bottom, and just like
in 1980, everybody's aspiring to see what the upside is.''
</P>
<P>
   +++++
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins were plagued by inconsistency in 1980, just as they
have been this season. They won at Washington by 15 points one
night, lost by 16 at Washington State two days later. They won at
Arizona by 12, then lost at Arizona State by 12.
</P>
<P>
   They relied heavily on a freshman, guard Rod Foster, just as
these Bruins rely on freshman forward Jason Kapono.
</P>
<P>
   They had a freshman point guard, Holton, who encountered some of
the same problems as Earl Watson, a junior in his first year as
point guard.
</P>
<P>
   They struggled with the complicated offense Brown brought from
his tenure with the NBA's Denver Nuggets, just as these Bruins
struggled with their new attack, the 1-4 high.
</P>
<P>
   Their ballhandling blunders peaked with a 24-turnover game at
Washington State, just as these Bruins committed 24 turnovers in
their 29-point loss at Arizona State.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so much talent on this team,'' Bruins forward Darrell
Allums said in 1980. ``When we rebound, play defense, run and take
care of the ball . . . it's difficult to stop us.''
</P>
<P>
   Sound familiar?
</P>
<P>
   Brown made two January adjustments that turned the season. He
simplified the offense by abandoning NBA plays and concentrating on
John Wooden's famed high post. He also benched unproductive
veterans like Allums, Gig Sims and Tyren Naulls in favor of the
freshman guards and sophomore center Mike Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   As the return of JaRon Rush has energized these Bruins, so did
the lineup shuffle 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's moves did not have an immediate effect, but by mid-
February the Bruins were gaining momentum. They won four in a row,
lost at Arizona State, then avenged the earlier loss by beating
Washington State in Pauley Pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   Brown started his seniors in the home finale against Washington,
then watched the Huskies build a big lead behind guard Lorenzo
Romar (18 points) and hold on for a 72-70 upset. The loss dropped
UCLA to 15-9, its tournament chances fading fast.
</P>
<P>
   Brown blamed himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``He felt he had hurt the team's chances to be in the NCAAs,''
said former assistant Kevin O'Connor, now an executive with the
Utah Jazz. ``He said, `Maybe we shouldn't have done that.' But he
felt he owed it to the kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Desperate, the Bruins thrashed Cal and Stanford _ the worst
teams in the league _ and then hoped for the best on Selection
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember thinking, `We're not going to get in,' '' Holton
said. ``We thought we'd be one of the worst UCLA teams ever. We
thought that would be our legacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then a manager called me that morning and said we were in. I
felt like we had a new life.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ++++++
</P>
<P>
   Eager and anxious, the Bruins committed 23 turnovers in their
first-round game against Old Dominion, but senior forward Kiki
Vandeweghe's 34 points fueled a 13-point victory.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later they stunned DePaul, holding Mark Aguirre, the
nation's leading scorer, to 19 points (eight under his average).
</P>
<P>
   ``We're ready to play with anyone,'' Foster said at the time.
``People said we had fallen, and there was that Sports Illustrated
article (`Bruins in Ruins'). But we're a much better team than we
were at the start of the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Sound familiar?
</P>
<P>
   Although these Bruins have not played a tournament game, their
upset of No. 1 Stanford seemingly has filled them with the same
energy and optimism that engulfed the 1980 team after its victory
over DePaul.
</P>
<P>
   Will history repeat?
</P>
<P>
   ``When people get down on you, like they did in 1980 and like
they did this year, you feel the weight of it,'' Holton said.
``Then you reach a point that you can either give up, or pick
yourself up. When the pendulum swings, the result is a lot of
momentum. It happened in 1980, and we're feeling it now.''

PAUL RUDOLPH JOLLES, 80, ENVOY OF ATOMIC AGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By PAUL LEWIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Paul Rudolph Jolles, a Swiss diplomat who played a key role in
promoting the peaceful use of atomic energy through the
International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna and later became
chairman of Nestle, the big Swiss food products group, died March
11 in Bern. He was 80.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of his life, Jolles had the unusual experience of
seeing the fruits of his earliest diplomatic labor blow up into a
major political storm when the United States forced Switzerland's
banks to return unclaimed Holocaust-era assets to descendants of
the victims of Nazism.
</P>
<P>
   In 1946, on his first foreign posting in Washington, Jolles had
served as secretary to the chief of the Swiss delegation that
negotiated the so-called Washington Accord, in which the Swiss
agreed to turn over much of the Nazi gold and other German assets
Switzerland had amassed in its vaults. The agreement was supposed
to have settled Switzerland's postwar obligations toward the
victorious Allies for good.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1997 interview with the Swiss-German newspaper Der Bund,
which was posted on the internet, Jolles strongly defended
Switzerland's economic conduct during the war, saying:
``Switzerland never enriched itself, it simply traded according to
market criteria. During the war Switzerland's national income
increased only marginally _ by less than 1 percent a year.''
</P>
<P>
   Jolles had a lifelong passion for contemporary art and acquired
a sizeable personal collection. As chairman of Nestle from 1984 to
1990, he was particularly proud of his success in creating the
Nestle Art Foundation, which has become a major force on the Swiss
artistic scene.
</P>
<P>
   After holding a number of positions in the Swiss administration,
mainly concerned with foreign economic relations, Jolles became
deeply involved in President Dwight D. Eisenhower's Atoms for Peace
initiative, begun in December 1953. He served in 1957 as executive
secretary of the preparatory commission planning the International
Atomic Energy Agency.
</P>
<P>
   After the creation of the agency later that year, Jolles was
appointed one of its four deputy directors general, with
responsibility for administration, by the first director general,
W. Sterling Cole, a former New York state Republican congressman
who had served as chairman of the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy.
The other deputies came from France, the Soviet Union and Britain.
Jolly left the atomic energy agency in 1961, returning to the Swiss
administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an important job and he did it well,'' said Sir Brian
Urquhart, a former United Nations undersecretary-general for
special political affairs, who worked with him on setting up the
agency.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Bern on Dec. 25, 1919, Jolles studied law at the
Universities of Bern and Lausanne and in 1943 obtained a doctorate
in political science at Harvard University.
</P>
<P>
   In 1956 he married the former Erna Ryffel. He is survived by his
wife, two sons and a daughter.

COUNCIL CREATES ACCOUNT TO PAY OFF RAMPART LAWSUITS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Faced with the prospect of paying hundreds of
millions of dollars over Los Angeles Police Department scandal
lawsuits, the City Council created a special reserve account
Wednesday, rejecting use of tobacco settlement funds.
</P>
<P>
   The council voted 10-1 to create the reserve account for major
cases and to begin putting in money for potential future
settlements. However, it delayed for one week putting in the first
$20 million payment.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Richard Riordan had proposed selling the $300 million in
funds due the city over the next 25 years from the national tobacco
lawsuit settlement to bring in $100 million now.
</P>
<P>
   Councilman Mike Feuer, who chairs the council's Budget and
Finance Committee, said the council's action will provide
flexibility for city leaders by not tying up a guaranteed source of
revenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't afford to make decisions now that we would regret
later,'' Feuer said. ``We have to strike a balance of the goals of
funding the liability of Rampart with the least cost to the city
and the maximum flexibility for this council and this mayor, and
for future councils and future mayors.''
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Riordan would not say whether he will agree to the
council proposal, only that he is continuing to look at all options
to pay for Rampart Division lawsuits and settlements.
</P>
<P>
   Feuer said his concern is in seeing that there be no cuts in
service, which will be accomplished with the council's proposal.
</P>
<P>
   In a related development, a joint meeting of two City Council
committees urged approving $1.3 million for the Police Commission
to review a Board of Inquiry report into the Rampart case.
</P>
<P>
   The money - to come from the LAPD's salary savings account -
will go for office space and a team of attorneys and investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Inspector General Jeff Eglash and Executive Director Joe Gunn
said they have been given complete freedom in conducting the
inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the day, the inspector general and I will have
to put our signatures on this, and we would not do that on
something that does not reflect reality,'' Gunn said.

COMMENTARY: THE NRA'S CAMPAIGN
</HEADLINE>
  (ADDS penultimate graf with news of more LaPierre comments) 
 (rk) 
 By BOB HERBERT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Return with us now to those thrilling days of
yesteryear _ the 1960s. Cities like Newark and Detroit were going
up in flames. Public figures were being assassinated at a numbing
rate. And crime was beginning its long, relentless climb to
horrifying heights.
</P>
<P>
   Lyndon Johnson thought it might be prudent to do something about
guns. He called for the registration of all firearms and said all
gun owners should be licensed. After Sirhan Sirhan shot Robert
Kennedy with a snub-nosed .22-caliber revolver, Johnson implored
Congress ``in the name of sanity ... in the name of safety, and in
the name of an aroused nation, to give America the gun control it
needs.''
</P>
<P>
   Not a chance. The gun lobby wouldn't hear of it.
</P>
<P>
   Robert J. Spitzer, in his book ``The Politics of Gun Control,''
noted the hysterical reaction of Harold W. Glassen, the president
of the National Rifle Association, to a watered-down version of
Johnson's proposal. Glassen said the legislation was part of an
effort to ``foist upon an unsuspecting and aroused public a law
that would, through its operation, sound the death knell for the
shooting sport and eventually disarm the American public.''
</P>
<P>
   The NRA and its allies and lackeys in Congress made sure
Americans were not disarmed. We have the body counts to prove it.
According to Handgun Control, a group that lobbies for stricter gun
laws, ``More Americans were killed with guns in the 18-year period
between 1979 and 1997 (651,697) than were killed in battle in all
wars since 1775 (650,858).''
</P>
<P>
   Osha Gray Davidson, in his 1998 book ``Under Fire: The NRA and
the Battle for Gun Control,'' wrote:
</P>
<P>
   ``The list of casualties from this country's gun violence does,
indeed, read like the body count of a major war. In the United
States today, one person dies by gunshot every eighteen minutes, 24
hours a day. In a year, that adds up to nearly 30,000 deaths. In
two years, more Americans are killed by guns here at home than died
in the entire Vietnam War. Of that annual total, about 15,000
commit suicide, 11,000 are murdered, and some 1,500 die in
accidents involving guns.''
</P>
<P>
   Lyndon Johnson said, ``Our citizens must get licenses to fish,
to hunt and to drive. Certainly no less should be required for the
possession of lethal weapons that have caused so much horror and
heartbreak in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   The gun lobby was not amused.
</P>
<P>
   The NRA is more than a powerful, single-issue lobbying group.
It's a radical, inflammatory, obsessive outfit, deaf to public
opinion, that has stood like a colossus in the way of reasonable
gun control, and thus has contributed mightily to the long decades
of carnage in our streets and homes.
</P>
<P>
   It has learned nothing constructive since the 1960s. Which
brings us to Wayne LaPierre, the group's current executive vice
president. All you need to know about LaPierre's leadership role
with the NRA is summed up in a passage he wrote in a 1992 column in
American Rifleman magazine. It was cited in Davidson's book:
</P>
<P>
   ``If the NRA was an army at war, and we knew an enemy train was
carrying troops to the front in an attempt to turn the tide of
battle, it would be our duty ... to take up the tracks, or blow up
a bridge ... because when you're at war, you do what it takes to
win.''
</P>
<P>
   Last Sunday, on national television, LaPierre made the
disgusting assertion that President Clinton was willing to accept a
certain amount of violence and killing to further the interests of
gun control. In his twisted logic, tragedies like the killings at
Columbine High School strengthened the case for gun control _ at
least in the minds of some people _ and therefore were acceptable
or in some sense tolerable to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how LaPierre put it: ``I've come to believe that he needs
a certain level of violence in this country. He's willing to accept
a certain level of killing to further his political agenda and his
vice president, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The Times, in an editorial, denounced what it described as
LaPierre's ``sick suggestion.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday LaPierre continued his rant against Clinton, all but
blaming him for a gun death last year. What gun control advocates
really need are more Wayne LaPierres. He embodies the extremism and
the craziness embedded in the policies and the philosophy of the
NRA. The higher his profile, the better.

   LOS ANGELES _ Six years after a version of the Confederate flag
was removed from a Los Angeles County display, the county veterans
advisory commission wants it restored to the Civic Center Mall.
</P>
<P>
   The veterans said the flag deserves to fly in the Court of
Historic American Flags downtown because it is part of U.S.
history. But at least one county supervisor and a spokesman for the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People said it
is inappropriate.
</P>
<P>
   Called the Stars and Bars, the flag displays three bars and
seven stars, predating the more commonly known Confederate flag
with diagonal bars and stars in the margin.
</P>
<P>
   Sonny Sardo, chairman of the 10-member veterans commission, said
the flag pays homage to the soldiers who died beneath it in battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``People die under certain flags, and flags have meaning to
people,'' said Sardo, a Vietnam War combat veteran who lost a leg
to a land mine. ``People have died under the American flag, and
that flag will always be sacred to people. People died under the
Confederate flag for those ideas, right or wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke, who sponsored a
motion in 1994 to remove the flag and is the board's only
African-American, said the flag is offensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sort of like if we had the Nazi flag up there,'' she
said. ``What do you think the response would be? Do you think the
Jewish community would feel upset by it?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think every time someone passed by there - not only people
who are African-American, but descendants of those who fought on
the other side - they really resented it.''
</P>
<P>
   The board-appointed commission has one vacancy and includes two
African-Americans, three Latinos, a Filipino and three whites. It
voted unanimously in June to recommend that the supervisors return
the flag to the Civic Center Mall between Hill Street and Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   The commission decided to wait until after the March election to
make its request.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a matter of historical accuracy. It's not a matter of
election politics. I chose to hold the item rather than cause any
embarrassment to any person involved,'' said Joseph Smith, a
retired Marine colonel and director of the county Department of
Military and Veterans Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   So far none of the supervisors has agreed to put the request to
a vote.
</P>
<P>
   Supervisors Zev Yaroslavsky, Michael D. Antonovich and Don Knabe
declined to comment. Supervisor Gloria Molina said she is opposed.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, however, the board voted to take down the Stars and
Bars flag after it was mistakenly replaced with the Confederate
battle flag, Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   In its place, the county hung a Vietnam Prisoner of War/Missing
in Action flag, which Sardo said would have to be taken down to
make way for the Stars and Bars flag. However, another prisoner of
war/MIA flag is across the street, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Geraldine Washington, executive director of the Los Angeles
chapter of the NAACP, said flying even the early version of the
Confederate flag would be divisive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have enough issues in California that are divisive and
mean-spirited without introducing another issue that could separate
rather than unite our citizens,'' she said. ``I would say that we
just don't need anything else that would divide us.''
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Levinson, director of the San Fernando Valley office of
the Anti-Defamation League, said the ADL does not oppose putting
the flag back up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our reaction is that it sounds like it's in a historical
setting,'' Levinson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as we know, no white supremacist or extremists use the
Stars and Bars flag as a symbol of hate. That further lessens the
complications here.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars and Bars flag flew first in 1970 with 17 other flags,
including the Taunton flag of 1774; Betsy Ross flag of 1777;
Star-Spangled Banner of 1795; Lone Star flag of Texas of 1839;
California Bear flag of 1846; Fort Sumter flag of 1859; and Civil
War flag with 33 stars.
</P>
<P>
   Edwin Bearss, retired emeritus chief historian for the National
Park Service in Washington, D.C., said similar Stars and Bars flags
are flown in historical flag courts across the country.

COMMENTARY: BLESS THIS HOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (INSERTS ``some of the 2,500 people'' in 8th graf) 
 (rk) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In 1832, during Andrew Jackson's administration,
Charles Pise, the assistant pastor of St. Patrick's Church in the
District of Columbia, was chosen to be chaplain of the Senate.
There has not been a Catholic chaplain in the Congress since. The
House of Representatives has never been regularly led in prayer by
a priest.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, in a fit of democratic outreach, Speaker Dennis
Hastert gave up his prerogative of naming the House chaplain and
appointed a committee of 18 members to come up with a consensus
choice. That was his first mistake.
</P>
<P>
   A priest got the most votes. A couple of Protestant ministers
were runners-up. Hastert interviewed the three and _ on the merits,
no religious prejudice involved _ made his second mistake. This
fair-minded speaker, meaning well, decided that the clergyman who
would do the best job of invoking God's help every morning was one
of the ministers.
</P>
<P>
   All hell _ perhaps all Hell _ has broken loose. Especially after
the controversial visit by George W. Bush to Bob Jones U., which
views Catholicism as a satanic cult, many Catholic members of the
House took offense. Understandably, the rejected priest believes he
would have had the job had he been a Protestant like every previous
House chaplain.
</P>
<P>
   The speaker's third mistake was to freeze, allowing this
seemingly minor matter to fester. Democrats look at a state like
New Jersey, where every other voter is Catholic, and see a gut
issue that could swing the House majority and affect the
presidential election as well.
</P>
<P>
   Forty House Republicans who are Catholic are leaning on the
speaker to change his mind, while many Protestant GOP members,
egged on by irate evangelicals, see any imputation by Democrats of
religious prejudice as a crass political ploy and demand that
Hastert stand his ground.
</P>
<P>
   How to resolve the impasse? My first thought was to put forward
a compromise of unassailable political correctness, like a female
African-American rabbi; unfortunately, I know of none. And what
with the fuss about the fund raising at the Hacienda Heights
temple, this is not the right year for a Buddhist.
</P>
<P>
   While at it, let us examine an even more startling compromise:
Why have a House chaplain at all? Doesn't this leap the barrier
between church and state? Cannot Congressmen avail themselves of
the spiritual counsel of some of the 2,500 people in the clergy in
D.C. without relying on the perk of a chaplain-on-the-spot?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is no; much is to be said for tradition. The
Continental Congress established the office of chaplain in 1774,
and many of the same men who framed the Constitution voted for such
an office in the Senate and House. In over two centuries, it has
not been a force for the establishment of a state religion. And it
was George Washington, taking the first inaugural oath, who added
the words ``So help me God!'' which his successors continue to this
day with no complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, Mr. Speaker, brace yourself to your duty. Recognize
that this is not a theological decision, nor a choice among
counselors to pick one who will best assuage the guilt of
iron-triangulating members voting against the interests of their
constituents (better a house psychiatrist for that). Yours is a
symbolic gesture in a political year.
</P>
<P>
   A run of 58 House chaplains in 210 years without a single
Catholic is enough. With nearly 30 percent of our representatives
Catholic, good ecumenical sense and good politics suggest that it's
time a priest be given the honor of writing and delivering the
nonsectarian prayer that opens the sessions.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush should show some leadership by calling the
speaker on St. Patrick's Day to urge him to name the priest. The
Democratic standard-bearer, Al Gore, should call the House minority
leader, Dick Gephardt, to make a commitment to support the
Protestant now chosen by Hastert to follow on as chaplain, whoever
becomes the next speaker.
</P>
<P>
   That compromise would quickly avert the ugly divisiveness
America doesn't need. And if any black or Hispanic or Asian girl is
now dreaming of rabbinical school, she too should have a chance to
become a chaplain in the Congress of the United States.

NUT? YEAH, THAT'S THE RIGHT NAME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE SHELBURNE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; So your wife is ready to divorce you, your oldest friends
struggle to empathize, only your golfing buddies truly understand
your obsession to be on the course, and you think you're the golf
nut of all golf nuts?
</P>
<P>
   Think again.
</P>
<P>
   Meet Nobby Orens, a 62-year-old Encino resident and Braemar
Country Club member who has been voted the 1999 Golf Nut of the
Year by the Golf Nuts Society.
</P>
<P>
   With good reason.
</P>
<P>
   To list just a few of Orens' golf feats last year, he:
</P>
<P>
   __ Played 134 rounds on 36 courses in 27 cities, five states,
six countries and two continents;
</P>
<P>
   __ Logged 38,445 air miles during one six-month period for
golf-related trips;
</P>
<P>
   __ On July 20 played 18 holes in each of three cities on two
continents, teeing off with a 4:58 a.m. round at Stockley Park GC
near London, then flying to New York, where he played a one-hour,
five-minute round at Clearview GC, then taking another flight to
LAX and a helicopter ride to Braemar, where he completed his third
round of the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll probably be a golf nut forever, or as long as my wife
will keep me,'' said Orens, happily married to Carol for 31 years.
Their doormat reads, ``A golfer and a normal person live here.''
</P>
<P>
   The 16-handicapper, a father of three and grandfather of six,
says he became officially hooked on the game when he went to Pebble
Beach seven years ago to attend the wedding of one of his children.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went to the driving range just to waste some time and . .
.''
</P>
<P>
   The rest is amazing, even for someone who has as golf-friendly a
job as Orens, who owns Plaza Travel, Inc. and describes himself as
``Director of Golf Research.''
</P>
<P>
   Since that fateful day on the range at Pebble Beach, he has:
</P>
<P>
   __ Once played 200 holes in a single day at a tournament in
Alaska and wound up disappointed daylight lasted only 19 hours;
</P>
<P>
   __ Twice crossed an ocean to play at least 18 holes at sites
more than 5,000 miles apart on the same day, aided by the
international date line on a 1998 New Zealand-to-Los Angeles trip.
</P>
<P>
   __ Played 100 holes in a tournament in Hawaii one day the day
after his trip from New Zealand;
</P>
<P>
   __ Once lost 17 balls in a single round playing in high winds
and on another occasion played _ in the only group on the course _
in torrential rain so severe his golf cart ``drowned'' in a hollow
near the 18th tee.
</P>
<P>
   The day Orens got a 4:15 a.m. phone call to go to the hospital
for the birth of his sixth grandchild, he threw his clubs into the
trunk just in case his daughter delivered in time for him to make
his 8:28 a.m. tee time. She did, and so did he.
</P>
<P>
   So goes life and golf for the man who owns nine golf statues,
249 golf shirts, a TV remote that changes channels to the sound of
a club hitting a ball, and has golf-ball collections of 220 at home
and at the office, where his desk is topped by a replica of a golf
hole _ with working waterfall.
</P>
<P>
   Orens' most unusual golf endeavor, however, might be the one
that failed. On New Year's Eve, he was a few minutes late for his
11:59:58 p.m. tee time and missed hitting a golf ball from the old
millennium into the new millennium. But he surely became one of the
quickest to hit a ball in 2000, teeing off from his friend's patio
shortly after midnight.
</P>
<P>
   Also the Golf Nut of the Year runner-up for 1998, Orens ranks
third on the all-time points list for the society
(www.golfnutssociety.com), based in Salt Lake City and founded by
Ron Garland in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Orens was bested in 1998 by Wendi Keene, the society's first
female champion. She prevailed after taking up the game at age 38
and becoming so thoroughly hooked she built an indoor driving range
in her garage, practiced there nightly for the first six months and
after seven years switched from playing right-handed to
left-handed.
</P>
<P>
   Keene and Orens are merely continuing the head-shaking history
of the society, some of whose past accomplishments are worthy of
note and possibly awe.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Malay, the inaugural Golf Nut of the Year, won that award
for 1986 after driving to a tournament 85 miles away, having a flat
tire, discovering his spare also was flat and then lacing on his
spikes, shouldering his golf bag and hitchhiking to the nearest
town, where he hired a local cropduster to fly him to the
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Merle Bell, the 1992 Golf Nut of the Year, played golf in all 50
states one year, then did it again _ left-handed _ the next year.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Seelig, named Golf Nut of the Year for 1991, achieved
lasting fame the day he was nearly killed in an automobile
accident, woke up in an ambulance and asked, ``Where are my
clubs?''
</P>
<P>
   But the best story of all involves E.M. Vandeweghe, named Golf
Nut of the Year at age 89 in 1993. He played golf 74 years,
practiced every day for 50 consecutive years and one day ``Got
it!'' while practicing his swing in his backyard. His son Ernie put
down the top on the convertible and E.M. _ still holding the club
in his newly discovered grip _ was driven to the course. There,
Ernie teed up a ball for his dad, who promptly shanked it into the
pro shop.

REPUBLICANS IN THE HOUSE CAN'T MATCH BUSH'S TAX CUT PLAN
</HEADLINE>
  (ADDS ``near'' to correct 2nd graf; ADDS 10th graf with Clinton
reaction)  
 (Eds.: This story is now on the Times A1; see also BUSH-NYT.)  
(rk) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In taking their first step toward a federal budget
for next year, House Republicans were left Wednesday in the awkward
position of backing a smaller tax cut than their party's
presumptive presidential nominee, Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The tax and spending blueprint, passed by the House Budget
Committee on a near party line vote of 23-18, would provide more
money for the Pentagon and education, freeze or cut many other
programs and set aside at least $150 billion and perhaps as much as
$250 billion for tax cuts over five years starting in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's plan calls for a tax cut of $483 billion over five years
starting in 2002. His plan would require roughly $300 billion for
the tax cuts over the period covered by the House Republican plan.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans insisted they had no disagreement with Bush
over the size of the tax cut and said they were confident that with
a Republican in the White House they could find the additional
money needed to close the gap between their plans.
</P>
<P>
   A Republican ``with a reform agenda'' like Bush could easily
squeeze another $50 billion out of government spending over five
years, said Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio, who is chairman of the budget
committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not backing away from the Bush tax cut and neither are
members of this committee,'' Kasich said.
</P>
<P>
   But the difficulty that Republican leaders have had in coming up
with a plan that would give Bush all that he wants highlighted
their problems in translating their ideological penchant for
smaller government into spending restraint that even a
Republican-controlled Congress can swallow. And it gave the White
House, Vice President Al Gore and Democrats in Congress a new
opportunity to portray Bush's plan as excessive.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats on the budget committee went so far as to tweak the
Republicans Wednesday by offering an amendment to the budget plan
calling for Bush's tax plan to be included. The amendment was
defeated.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Sperling, the director of the White House's National
Economic Council, said that ``if you were looking for a
definition'' of fiscal irresponsibility, ``it would be a tax cut
that was so excessive that even the House Republicans are basically
forced to admit they couldn't afford it.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement released Wednesday night, President Clinton
responded to the vote by calling the Republican budg- et plan
``risky'' and warning that it threatened fiscal discipline that has
led to economic prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's aides said the situation just helped to make his point
that Congress, under pressure from President Clinton, has been far
too willing to spend money and that the best remedy was to send as
much of the government's revenue as possible back to the people who
earned it, the taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor believes that money left in Washington is likely
to be spent, and that covers both parties,'' said Ari Fleischer,
Bush's spokesman. ``It will take a new president to change the way
Washington does business and turn things around.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan passed by the committee calls for an increase in
overall government spending of 3 percent, to $1.85 trillion. About
two-thirds of that amount would go to Social Security, Medicare,
interest payments on the national debt and other commitments that
Congress does not revisit each year.
</P>
<P>
   The other third of the budget, which covers everything from the
space program and the FBI to Head Start and environmental programs,
would rise by 3.16 percent under the Republican plan, to $596.5
billion.
</P>
<P>
   But nearly all of that increase would go to the military, which
would see its budget rise 6 percent next year, to $307.3 billion.
The increase in non-military programs would be held to three-tenths
of 1 percent, well below the inflation rate, which is running
between 2 and 3 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   The plan would set aside $40 billion over five years to finance
a yet-to-be developed plan to add prescription drug coverage to
Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   The plan would reserve the portion of the surplus generated by
excess Social Security revenues to pay down the national debt. It
would also create a $60 billion reserve that Congress could use
either for further debt reduction or additional tax cuts. And it
would reserve for tax cuts any surplus beyond what is currently
projected by the Congressional Budget Office.
</P>
<P>
   Kasich said it was not unrealistic to believe that the budget
office will increase its surplus projection this year by $40
billion. That money, combined with the $60 billion reserve, would
allow the $150 billion tax cut over five years to rise to as much
as $250 billion, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Spratt Jr. of South Carolina, the senior Democrat on
the budget committee, said the proposal would prove to be no more
workable than the Republican budget plans of the last few years,
which set spending at levels for most programs far below what
Congress and Clinton ultimately agreed upon.
</P>
<P>
   Even before Kasich had made the details of the Republican plan
public, White House officials attacked it. Jacob J. Lew, the
director of the White House's Office of Management, called it
``fundamentally flawed'' and said it would gut a wide array of
programs, from environmental cleanup to aid for poor women and
children.

LOS ANGELES OFFICIALS FEUD OVER INQUIRY INTO POLICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (ADDS sentence in third graf from end clarifying position of U.S.
attorney) (bl)  
 By JAMES STERNGOLD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A simmering feud between the Los Angeles police
chief and the county district attorney over the handling of a major
police corruption scandal erupted Wednesday, with the police chief
refusing to cooperate fully with the local prosecutors and then
being humiliated with a rebuke by several law-enforcement
officials.
</P>
<P>
   The chief, Bernard C. Parks, had instructed his department in
recent weeks to provide documents and other information about the
criminal investigation first to the U.S. attorney in Los Angeles,
several people close to the matter said, and only later to
prosecutors in the district attorney's office if the U.S. attorney
approved.
</P>
<P>
   In an increasingly heated exchange of letters, the district
attorney, Gil Garcetti, wrote on Tuesday that while the police
should provide information to the federal officials, that ``doesn't
relieve you of the responsibility to cooperate with us.''
</P>
<P>
   Garcetti said in a radio interview Wednesday, ``You cannot come
up with a valid reason why he is doing this.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, the Los Angeles city attorney, James Hahn, wrote a
letter to Parks insisting that he had a legal obligation to respond
to the district attorney's requests.
</P>
<P>
   ``The police chief cannot pick and choose which prosecutors he
deals with,'' Hahn said in an interview, adding that the chief had
never informed him about his resistance or asked for legal advice.
</P>
<P>
   Hahn also said Parks had told him Wednesday that the situation
had been blow out of proportion and misinterpreted. Cmdr. David
Kalish, the department's chief spokesman, did not return calls
Wednesday seeking comment, but he was quoted in The Los Angeles
Times on Wednesday morning saying, ``It doesn't make sense to work
with two prosecutorial agencies simultaneously and have two
parallel investigations. This is the best approach. The cases will
be taken directly to the U.S. attorney, who will make the
appropriate prosecutorial decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   The California attorney general, Bill Lockyer, publicly rebuked
the police chief for this stand, saying, ``The current posture of
the Los Angeles Police Department, in refusing to provide
investigatory material to the district attorney is unfortunate,
counterproductive, and without legal authority.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that the district attorney's office ``is the best
agency to prosecute those cases arising out of the Rampart
investigations.''
</P>
<P>
   In the scandal, centered on the Rampart station in the
inner-city here, a number of police officers have been implicated
in abuses including stealing drugs, framing innocent people,
beating suspects and shooting at least two unarmed gang members and
then planting guns on them. Hundreds of criminal convictions may be
overturned and the city is preparing for what could be more than
$200 million in civil judgments.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. attorney, Alejandro Mayorcas, refused to comment.
People with knowledge of the investigation said Mayorcas spoke with
Parks Wednesday and made clear that he did not approve of any
refusal to provide information to the district attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Parks has vigorously pursued his own investigation of the
wrongdoing and issued a stinging report on the department's
managerial lapses, but he has repeatedly fought with the district
attorney over the speed of the criminal inquiry, and he has
resisted any outside investigation of his department.
</P>
<P>
   Parks' actions also appear to have angered the Police
Commission, the department's civilian oversight body. Despite
corresponding with the district attorney's office for a week on the
problem, the chief never informed the commission of the battle,
even though there was a regularly scheduled commission meeting
Tuesday morning.

poor game by sharpshooting forward Jason Kapono, or hulking center
Dan Gadzuric, or gifted forward Jerome Moiso.
</P>
<P>
   However, they might not be able to survive and advance in the
NCAA Tournament without a consistent and solid effort from point
guard Earl Watson.
</P>
<P>
   In March Madness, guards rule.
</P>
<P>
   The best are calming influences. They control the tempo, they
direct the offense and they get the ball to the right players at
the right times.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins don't want erratic guard Ray Young taking 3-pointers
in the final minutes of a close game. They want Kapono, Moiso or
JaRon Rush taking big shots. It's Watson's job to make that
happens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to make sure we have our rotations down and that we're
organized on offense,'' Watson said. ``I have to call the right
sets, distribute the ball and make sure the guys are in the right
position.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, he's done it all. Watson is averaging 6.2
assists and 2.7 turnovers in the last six games. UCLA won all six.
</P>
<P>
   How will he respond to tournament pressure?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm comfortable and I'm excited,'' he said ``This is the first
time in the tournament that we've had our team together. No one's
hurt. No one's suspended.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Jelani McCoy quit in midseason and Baron Davis
was injured in the tournament. Last year, center Dan Gadzuric did
not play in the NCAAs because of a knee injury.
</P>
<P>
   __ The Knight of time: Quietly, reserve guard Billy Knight had a
remarkable late-season resurgence. He did not play a second against
the Oregon schools Feb. 24 and 26, but he charged off the bench to
make five critical 3-pointers in victories over Cal and Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   It was ideal timing for the Bruins, who might need Knight's
marksmanship in the tournament. Single-elimination pressure, zone
defenses and dome stadiums often make for difficult shooting
environments.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that Billy has emerged as an offensive threat and is
playing with such confidence couldn't be better,'' Bruins coach
Steve Lavin said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Defending Duane: Ball State's top scorer and best player is
guard Duane Clemens, a crafty left-hander who can penetrate or
shoot 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   In man-to-man situations, the Bruins probably will rotate
defenders on Clemens. It could be Watson, Young or Ryan Bailey. If
that fails, they'll switch to a matchup zone and extend it to the
3-point line.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to do a good job keeping him out of the paint,'' said
Steve Spencer, the UCLA assistant who oversees the defense.
</P>
<P>
   Watch for Ball State to counter UCLA's size with speed, perhaps
with a three-guard attack. The combination of Clemens, point guard
Mickey Hosier and one of two reserve guards, Cedric Moodie or
Patrick Jackson, could force the Bruins to go small.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've gone with three guards sometimes,'' Spencer said.
``We'll go with our lineup, they'll go with their's, and we'll see
who adjusts. If they're going to play zone, they might go bigger.
</P>
<P>
   __ And finally: Gadzuric suffered a mild sprain of his left
thumb during practice Wednesday but expects to be ready tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nothing serious,'' he said. ``It's the same thing I did
at Syracuse.''

LAKERS LOOK TO EXTEND WIN STREAK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, D.C. _ The Lakers have the Washington Wizards on the
schedule tonight.
</P>
<P>
   But actually, their date is with history.
</P>
<P>
   A victory at MCI Center would be the Lakers' 20th in a row,
matching the second-best single-season winning streak in NBA
history. The Milwaukee Bucks set that mark in 1970-71, a record
surpassed only once, by the 1971-72 Lakers who won 33 consecutive
games.
</P>
<P>
   No NBA team since has won more than 18, a span of 28 years.
</P>
<P>
   Now the current Lakers can move into another strata. Both the
1970-71 Bucks and the 1971-72 Lakers rode their streaks to the
championship.
</P>
<P>
   To this point, the Lakers have avoided using The Streak as
motivation. Each win stands alone. But tonight is different.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the team will itself be motivated by that, by the fact
that they can be part of something that's historic in their own
professional lives,'' said coach Phil Jackson. ``I think that's
intriguing for them. Yet we know that we can't take anything for
granted. Washington's playing pretty good basketball right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wizards are 20-45 and still closer to the lottery than the
playoffs. But they've shown some life lately, beating the New York
Knicks and Minnesota Timberwolves last week.
</P>
<P>
   If the Lakers get by the Wizards, they'll go for win No. 21 _
and sole possession of the NBA's second-best streak _ at Detroit on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Potentially undermining all of this a hamstring injury on the
right leg of Shaquille O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal has had two days of rest and therapy and though he's
unlikely to be 100 percent tonight, he vows to play through the
discomfort.
</P>
<P>
   That the Lakers are even in position to make history the next
two days is remarkable. They ran off 16 straight wins from
mid-December to mid-January, inspiring fantasies of challenging the
33-game record.
</P>
<P>
   But that streak ended with a thud, sending the Lakers into a 3-6
tailspin. Another month-long streak in the same season seemed
unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   Logic dictates this streak will end too, eventually. But the
Lakers have come a long way since their late-January hangover and
show no signs of letting down again.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've grown in experience, and also we`re playing much better
as a team,'' said Glen Rice, comparing the streaks. ``We have been
able to overcome the lapses we've had during our games.`'
</P>
<P>
   With the NBA's best record (53-11) and a four-game lead over
West rival Portland, the Lakers are trying to stay focused on
retaining their position, not necessarily on sustaining The Streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``The streak doesn't really motivate us,'' Rice said. ``The
thing that motivates us is we want to beat whatever teams are in
our way. If the streak continues, so be it.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, who won 18 straight as a player with the Knicks in
1969-70 and again as coach of the Chicago Bulls in 1995-96, views
it differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is special for us,'' he said, ``and we're very proud of
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's an intrigue about playing this string out,''
he said. ``Perhaps after we finish this streak and then we get into
the end of the season, we'll have to push to motivate the players
at some level, but right now, when you have a winning streak, it's
just kind of intriguing to go through it and find a way to continue
on.''

BOBB MCKITTRICK, 64, COACH OF STANDOUT OFFENSIVE LINE FOR 49ERS
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Bobb cq.) 
(nk) 
 By FRANK LITSKY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bobb McKittrick, who helped the San Francisco 49ers win five
Super Bowls in his two decades as one of the National Football
League's premier offensive-line coaches, died Wednesday at Stanford
(Calif.) University Medical Center. He was 64.
</P>
<P>
   McKittrick had been suffering from cancer of the bile duct. Last
spring, doctors canceled a liver transplant after exploratory
surgery showed the cancer had spread to the abdomen. McKittrick's
on-field coaching duties were assumed by Pat Morris last season,
but McKittrick continued to be involved with the 49ers.
</P>
<P>
   Year after year, working with comparatively smaller linemen like
Harris Barton, Guy McIntyre and Jesse Sapolu, McKittrick taught
blocking techniques that protected Joe Montana and Steve Young, the
49ers' all-pro quarterbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has developed more offensive-line knowledge than anyone,
ever,'' Bill Walsh, one of McKittrick's head coaches, once said.
``His men have played longer, with better technique, more
production, fewer injuries. In every possible category you can
measure, he's right at the top.''
</P>
<P>
   Sports Illustrated said McKittrick ``may be the most successful
position coach of his era'' since ``few coaches have done so much
with so little.''
</P>
<P>
   With McKittrick coaching their offensive line, the 49ers won the
Super Bowl in 1982, 1985, 1989, 1990 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
   McKittrick was atypical in many ways. In seventh-grade in Baker,
Ore., where he was born and raised, he changed the spelling of Bob
to Bobb because ``I just wanted to be different.'' He was a high
school valedictorian and an honor student at Oregon State, where he
played guard for the football team.
</P>
<P>
   He never played pro football. After three years in the Marine
Corps, he was an assistant coach for Oregon State (1961-64), UCLA
(1965-70), the Los Angeles Rams (1971-72) and the San Diego
Chargers (1974-78) before joining the 49ers in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   He was a stocky man with a shaved head and Spartan outlook. Even
on the coldest days, he wore a T-shirt and shorts to practice. For
a 1989 playoff game in Chicago, where the wind-chill factor sank to
minus 47 degrees, he made a major concession. He wore a jacket.
</P>
<P>
   The toughness extended to his illness. In June 1999, eight days
after doctors found McKittrick's cancer had spread, he returned to
the team for a minicamp, coaching from a golf cart. He said then:
``I feel like Bob Hope or one of those entertainers that gets to be
90 years old and really they're not very well, and all of a sudden
someone puts a microphone in front of them and they perform.''
</P>
<P>
   He remained upbeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It won't cure something,'' he said, ``but if you stay positive
and keep charging hard, it's the best answer you can do. The doctor
said, `I wouldn't change any plan that you've got because of what's
wrong. You just go like you're going to live forever, and if
something happens we'll work on it at that time.'''
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers' head coach, Steve Mariucci, had said that McKittrick
was a source of emotional strength for his players by remaining
with the team last year. The 49ers honored McKittrick with a
halftime tribute during a home game against the Tennessee Titans.
</P>
<P>
   McKittrick, who lived in San Mateo, Calif., is survived by his
wife, Teckla; two sons, Mike and Ladd, and two grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   In a business in which job changes are frequent, he was a
constant. He said football was his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't play golf, don't ski, don't hunt, don't play tennis,''
he once said. ``I coach football. And I like it.''

SHOOTOUT JURY TOLD TO TRY AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TROY ANDERSON 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Los Angeles _ After deliberating nearly three days, jurors in
the 1997 North Hollywood bank robbery shootout trial declared
Wednesday that they were deadlocked, but the judge ordered them to
try again.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors were expected to continue deliberating today on whether
police deliberately allowed bank robber Emil Matasareanu to bleed
to death after the chaotic shootout Feb. 28, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a duty to reach a unanimous verdict, if you can do so
without violating your conscience,'' U.S. District Judge Christina
A. Snyder told the tired six-man, six-woman jury.
</P>
<P>
   In federal civil trials, the jury must reach a unanimous
verdict. The jurors' announcement of a deadlock came after they had
reviewed five hours of testimony read back over two days to refresh
their recollections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regretfully, the jury is unable to reach a unanimous
verdict,'' jury foreman Wallace Flueckiger wrote in a note to the
judge. ``Each of us has reviewed the evidence and all jurors have
engaged in vigorous discussions. We all agree that additional
deliberations will be of no use.''
</P>
<P>
   Assistant City Attorney Donald Vincent, who represents former
police Officer James Vojtecky, asked Snyder to order that
deliberations resume.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit against the city and retired Officers John Futrell
and Vojtecky claims the officers let Matasareanu, 30, die as a
result of deliberate indifference.
</P>
<P>
   Outside court, Vincent said he asked the judge to send the jury
back for deliberations because he believes that will lead to a
verdict in favor of Vojtecky and Futrell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought with greater deliberation, they may come around,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Stephen Yagman, who filed the lawsuit on behalf of
Matasareanu's children, said he didn't want the jury to continue
deliberating, and that he would seek another trial if the jury is
deadlocked.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is a hung jury, there is no question I'll try the
case again,'' Yagman said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley C. Gage, the attorney representing Futrell, said he's
confident the jury will find in his client's favor, but that the
trial's expenses have devastated Futrell financially.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had to spend all his college savings for his children, and
he's not able to stay at the home he's in. He's been unable to work
during this trial,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   During the shootout, officers took on the two gunmen in a
rolling gunbattle on streets around a Bank of America. Eleven
officers and six civilians were wounded, and the other robber,
26-year-old Larry Phillips Jr., shot himself amid a hailstorm of
bullets.
</P>
<P>
   Police have insisted they did not know at the time whether there
were more gunmen, so the area was too dangerous to allow paramedics
in to render medical aid for Matasareanu, who lay bleeding in the
street.
</P>
<P>
   Both officers testified they tried to get the ambulance to come,
but Yagman focused on Futrell's cancellation of an ambulance call.
</P>
<P>
   A resident testified that a third masked gunman with a machine
gun hid in her yard during the gunbattle, although police contend
there were only two gunmen.

EMERSON QUICKLY MAKES CONTRIBUTION

<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Nelson Emerson had a great scoring chance on
his first shift with the Kings on Wednesday against the Mighty
Ducks and assisted on Bryan Smolinski's goal midway through the
first period.
</P>
<P>
   Emerson is a five-time 20-goal scorer who will work the point on
the Kings second power-play unit. But when Emerson arrived Tuesday
with Kelly Buchberger from Atlanta, one question stood out. Why are
the Kings his seventh organization in a 10-year career?
</P>
<P>
   ``When you play on the second line, you often find yourself the
victim when things don't go right,'' Kings coach Andy Murray said.
``They don't often trade the first-line guys. They make too much
money. Second-line guys make less and move more.''
</P>
<P>
   Emerson, 32, has played with St. Louis, Winnipeg,
Hartford/Carolina, Chicago, Ottawa and Atlanta. Last season, he
played for three clubs and for the second consecutive year, Emerson
was moved at the trade deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't always easy,'' Emerson said. ``It was very difficult
last year, and this time I was very surprised that I was traded.
But I'm coming from a team that worked hard, but was overmatched
most nights, to a team that has a chance to do something in the
playoffs. That's a good feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Silent Ducks: Mighty Ducks president and general manager
Pierre Gauthier said fans must understand why the Ducks haven't
been in the blockbuster trade market.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would remind them for every good player acquired one goes
the other way,'' he said. ``We have a good nucleus and we want to
keep adding to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Gauthier said the only way teams like Colorado and Detroit can
make big deals is to stockpile and ``in hockey it takes time to
build to that level.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are well into the process of building assets . . . we are
adding all the time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Fiset update: Kings goalie Stephane Fiset (groin) has skated
the last two days and could be ready to back up Jamie Storr on
Friday against St. Louis. Fiset has not played since March 4.
</P>
<P>
   __ Berg out: Aki Berg, who was hit hard and did not return in
Monday's game vs. Vancouver, did not play Wednesday. Berg was
replaced in the lineup by Jarolsav Modry.

HYLAN G. LEWIS, 88, STUDENT OF THE URBAN POOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ERIC PACE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Dr. Hylan Garnet Lewis, a sociologist and pioneer in
the field of community studies who was active in public life and
taught in New York for years, died March 8 at a hospital in
Versailles, France. He was 88, lived on Manhattan's Upper West Side
and had been visiting France.
</P>
<P>
   The death of Lewis, who was retired, was announced Tuesday by
the City University of New York Graduate Center, where he was a
professor of sociology for two decades, beginning in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   ``Professor Lewis, in his research, teaching and leadership in
public affairs, was a bright beacon that lit, and in a major way,
helped to guide more than a half-century of American race
relations,'' said Setsuko Matsunaga Nishi, a retired professor of
sociology at Brooklyn College and the Graduate Center.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis' 1955 book ``Blackways of Kent'' is a study of a black
community in the industrializing South. It has been called an
exemplary early product of community studies, which examines the
role of factors like race, job and economic status and family in
joining people together.
</P>
<P>
   From 1959 to 1964, Lewis directed a child-rearing study carried
out by the Health and Welfare Council in Washington. A key finding
of the study was that poor black mothers in Washington had
aspirations of success for their children that were just as high as
those of all middle-class mothers. But the study found that the
poor black mothers also had a realistic understanding of the
obstacles _ like racial prejudice, poverty and poor schools _ that
their children would face.
</P>
<P>
   These findings were important and influential, because it had
been widely thought at the time that these children had not been
succeeding in life because their families had not set high goals.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Lewis held posts in New York in which he analyzed, and
sought remedies for, the problems of the poor and unemployed. He
also studied discrimination against members of minorities in
corporate employment, foster care and schools.
</P>
<P>
   He was a senior associate at Kenneth B. Clark &AMP; Associates, a
consulting firm led by Clark, the noted psychologist and
race-relations expert, which advised corporations, schools and
other clients about racial integration.
</P>
<P>
   After teaching at Howard University and in the South, Lewis was
on the faculty of Brooklyn College from 1967 to 1977 and while
teaching at the Graduate Center he also taught at Queens College
from 1990 to 1992.
</P>
<P>
   He was born in Washington, received a bachelor's degree in 1932
from Virginia Union University in Richmond, Va., and his doctorate
in sociology in 1951 from the University of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   His 1935 marriage to Leighla Whipper ended in divorce.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his companion, Francoise Burgess; his wife,
the former Audrey Carter, from whom he had been separated for 26
years; a daughter, Carole Ione of Kingston, N.Y.; a son, Guy, of
Yreka, Calif.; three grandchildren, seven great-grandchildren and
two sisters, Kathryn Garner and Elsie Lewis, both of Washington.

MOISO SHUNS LIMELIGHT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ UCLA's postseason success rests largely on the
shoulders of a sophomore who is Don Quixote trapped in Gulliver's
body. If that scares you, Bruins fans, think how Jerome Moiso must
feel.
</P>
<P>
   Moiso is 6-foot-10 and quick as a quip. He looks like he should
be an intimidating, infuriating, incandescent presence in the
paint. Convention doesn't allow a player of his height much room
for growth. He is supposed to make up for in merit what his
opponents lack in inches.
</P>
<P>
   For no reason other than his size, people assume Moiso, a
center-forward, must have a snarl for a smile and skin as tough as
an alligator. It's a foregone conclusion that he is as territorial
as a Chihuahua.
</P>
<P>
   His narcissistic streak, like his pituitary gland, is presumed
to be in overdrive.
</P>
<P>
   People look at Moiso and expect him to flash his muscles, not
his insecurities.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder Moiso is just as likely to perplex people as please
them.
</P>
<P>
   Because the truth is, his aggressiveness doesn't yet match his
agility. His self-esteem is less developed than his 235-pound
frame. Like Don Quixote, whose name means ``the one who hides
himself,'' Moiso keeps trying to blend in even as he stands out. If
he were any more low-key, he would be invisible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerome doesn't want to draw attention to himself,'' Bruins
coach Steve Lavin said. And sure enough, when the Bruins' locker
room at the Metrodome was opened to reporters after practice
Wednesday, Moiso appeared to be missing.
</P>
<P>
   At length, a UCLA official blew Moiso's cover by flipping a
thick, white towel that covered the power forward's head like a
lollipop wrapper.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man,'' a reporter said, ``I almost missed you,'' to which
Moiso replied, ``That was the purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   His tone was flat, but his smile was wide and there was mischief
in his eyes. To read Moiso, it's important to look at his
expression; his face often registers humor when his words are no
laughing matter.
</P>
<P>
   After UCLA escaped with an overtime win against South Florida in
December, Moiso said, ``Had we lost, I would have quit the team.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Bruins' season hit a hellacious ice patch in February,
Moiso was quoted as saying he was so frustrated he thought about
going home to Guadeloupe, in the West Indies, so he could hang out
on the beach with the topless ladies and be a fisherman and sell
coconuts.
</P>
<P>
   He was just kidding in both instances, but some people came away
with the wrong impression. He was criticized for not caring when
the truth is, Moiso, 21, makes light of things because he cares so
deeply he often feels overwhelmed.
</P>
<P>
   The player's sense of humor, said Bruins coach Steve Lavin, is
Moiso's ``defense mechanism.'' Like the towel, it's what he hides
behind when he's feeling vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I'm not at ease,'' Moiso admitted, ``I try to joke
around.''
</P>
<P>
   If it has taken him time to find his comfort zone on the court,
there's a reason. Moiso honed his basketball skills in his native
Paris. He was a leading European junior player, which is not unlike
being a top male junior soccer player in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   Moiso knew the best competition was on the other side of the
ocean, so he enrolled at Milford Academy and played only a few
games there before enrolling at UCLA. He's playing catch-up in a
position where time and repetition are the best teachers. Moiso
hasn't learned his role well enough to please himself. Last year,
if he couldn't be perfect, he didn't want to risk failing.
</P>
<P>
   There were times, Lavin said, ``I told Jerome, `We're going to
you,' and he said, `Coach, not tonight. I'm not feeling it
tonight.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Goodness knows Jim Harrick never had that conversation with Don
McLean.
</P>
<P>
   It gladdens Lavin to report that lately Moiso has been demanding
the ball. The No. 6-seeded Bruins, who play No. 11 Ball State
tonight, definitely are better when Moiso boxes out modesty and
asserts himself on both ends of the floor.
</P>
<P>
   During the Bruins' February fiasco, when they lost six of seven
games and fell to seventh in the Pac-10, Moiso shot 45.6 percent
from the field. In two of the defeats, he had no blocked shots, and
during the stretch he averaged 4.6 defensive rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   On the Bruins' March mending tear that has produced six
consecutive victories, Moiso has shot 51.9 percent from the field,
blocked at least one shot in every game and averaged 6.0 defensive
rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Moiso is young in basketball years, but he is more experienced
than Ball State's frontcourt. If he and Dan Gadzuric can take
Lonnie Jones and Theron Smith to school, the Bruins (19-11) figure
to ace tonight's test.
</P>
<P>
   No one save for guard Earl Watson is more pivotal to the Bruins'
postseason providence than Moiso. And he knows it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not satisfied with with what I've done this season,''
Moiso said. ``I expect more of myself. I'm looking at (the
tournament) as a new season. I can't wait to see how I do.''
</P>
<P>
   He's not the only one. People, after all, know a player his size
can make all the difference.

by guards, kept in solitary confinement for months for no reason

Harlem, with its glossy mall, its new Old Navy and corner
Starbuck's. This is a modest renaissance that encompasses renovated

   GERMANY-DEVELOP (Wuensdorf, Germany) _ The train from Berlin to
Dresden makes a local stop at Wuensdorf, a dot on the map 25 miles

Wuensdorf led a secret double life: a sleepy Prussian village
twinned with a forbidden city of soldiers. Now it is a city of

principle of my Week At-A-Glance diary: blue for work-related
entries; red for personal; black for illness, public appearances
and acts of God; green for extra-curricular projects. Much more
than just a pen, it's my personal Palm Pilot. You know the pen I'm
talking about: fat plastic barrel with four plungers _ blue, red,
black and green. Maybe you had a BIC 4C in school and thought
they'd stopped making them. They haven't. What they have done is
changed them. By Rick Marin.

   GE-RECALL (Undated) _ Should consumers with defective GE
dishwashers rewire them or buy new ones? And how much of the cost
should GE pick up? From April 1983 to January 1989, General
Electric produced 3.1 million dishwashers with a defective slide
switch (Heated Dry/Energy Saver) that has the potential to melt or
ignite, creating a fire hazard. Although there have been no
injuries from the switch, there have been about 50 incidents, three
of which damaged homes. About 900,000 of the dishwashers were still
being used by consumers and property managers when the recall began
last year. By Rosalie Radomsky.

   NIKKO-FIRS (New York) _ The Nikko firs rose 70 feet over our

EDITORIAL: COUNTERING HIGH GASOLINE PRICES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, La.)   (bl)  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, March 16:
</P>
<P>
   Gasoline prices hover around $2 a gallon in parts of the United
States, and threaten to rise to similar levels in many other
regions. Consumers are upset, and there is no easy solution to the
problem.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Republicans thought for a time that they had a
deft answer in going after what they called the ``Gore tax,'' the
4.3 cents per gallon that a Democrat-controlled Congress tacked
onto the federal gasoline tax in 1993. But this week Republican
leaders abandoned that frivolous idea. If it were effective,
reducing taxes on gasoline would only encourage Americans to buy
more foreign oil _ at the same time that Saudi Arabia and other oil
producers have tripled their price. But the tax cut would mostly
benefit oil companies, which could raise prices to offset it,
rather than consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Congress does have a partial remedy at hand. Lying in salt domes
in Louisiana and Texas are about 600 million barrels of oil. This
Strategic Petroleum Reserve was created to handle genuine oil
crises, not the run-up in home heating oil prices in New England in
February and in gasoline prices in March. But there is a policy,
called swaps, that would provide some relief without compromising
the use of the reserve for a future crisis. The idea is to invite
oil companies to remove oil today from the reserve, expanding the
supply and easing prices somewhat, in exchange for returning an
even larger amount of oil in the future. Swaps would knock only
about a nickel off the price of gasoline, according to one
estimate.
</P>
<P>
   The simple fact is that Americans will gain substantially lower
prices for gasoline only if oil exporters decide to increase
production by a substantial amount. The exporters will meet later
this month and discuss raising production by about 1 to 2 million
barrels a day. That could cut gasoline prices by up to 7.5 cents a
gallon. Americans can also weaken the impact of high oil prices, no
matter what the future levels, by cutting back consumption. Yet
foreign oil exports will continue to dominate America's energy
picture and will operate largely independent of what Americans do.

   Jack Mann, 74, Sports Editor and Writer &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jack Mann, an award-winning sportswriter and editor, died March
11 in Columbia, Md. He was 74 and lived in Laurel, Md. The cause
was cancer, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   Mann was the sports editor at Newsday from 1960 to 1962, helping
turn what had been a section with a local focus into one that
covered sports events nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   He was a two-time winner of the Eclipse Award for outstanding
writing about horse racing and the Walter Haight Award for turf
writing. He wrote ``The Decline and Fall of the New York Yankees''
(Simon &AMP; Schuster, 1966), which described how one of the great
dynasties in sports declined under the ownership of CBS.
</P>
<P>
   John Austin Mann Jr., who was born in Brooklyn, worked for The
New York Herald Tribune, The Washington Daily News, The Washington
Star, The Baltimore Evening Sun, The Racing Times, The Washington
Times, The Miami Herald, The Detroit Free Press and Sports
Illustrated.
</P>
<P>
   Mann is survived by eight children: Karen Stevenson, vice
president and general counsel of Knight-Ridder Inc. in San
Francisco; Alan of Long Island, Steven of Richmond, Va., David of
New York and Donald of Ashland, Ore., from a first marriage;
Katherine of McLean, Va., and Jeffrey of Santa Cruz, Calif.; and a
stepson, Devin Mann of Los Angeles, from a second marriage.
</P>
<P>
   His first marriage, to Edythe Vaughan Stevenson, ended in
divorce in 1966. His second marriage, to Judith Warden Luce, now
Judy Mann, a columnist for The Washington Post, ended in divorce in
1983.

   Joseph Sullivan, 63; Led Turnpike Unit &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Sullivan, a New Jersey businessman who ran unsuccessfully
for governor and later served as chairman of the New Jersey
Turnpike Authority, died March 13 at a hospital in Morristown, N.J.
He was 63.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a stroke, said a son, Edward Sullivan.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan, who lived in New Vernon, N.J., spent $1 million and
came in third in the Republican primary in 1981, behind Thomas
Kean, who became governor, and former Paterson Mayor Lawrence
Kramer. After the election, Kean appointed Sullivan to head the
turnpike authority. Sullivan was later also appointed finance
chairman of the state's Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   Known as Bo, Sullivan was born on Feb. 10, 1937, in Manhattan.
He graduated from Princeton University and earned a law degree from
Seton Hall University.
</P>
<P>
   Before entering politics, Sullivan was president and chief
executive of Bomont Industries, based in West Caldwell, N.J., that
once produced typewriter ribbons but now specializes in laser
printers and industrial fabrics.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his son, Edward, who lives in Hoboken, Sullivan is
survived by his wife, Eileen; three other sons, Joseph of Mendham,
N.J.; Michael of Bernardsville, N.J., and James of Mendham, and 10
grandchildren.

   Alexander Dreier, 83, Broadcast Journalist Who Won 7 Emmys &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Alexander Dreier, a broadcaster who was known for his reports
from Europe during World War II and who later worked as a
television journalist in Southern California and Chicago, died
March 12 at his home in Rancho Mirage, Calif. He was 83.
</P>
<P>
   Dreier was born in Honolulu on June 26, 1916. He became a
reporter for United Press and went to Europe soon after his
graduation from Stanford University in 1939. In 1941 he was
expelled by the Nazis and moved to London, where he worked for the
BBC.
</P>
<P>
   From 1948 to 1965 he worked for local radio and television
affiliates of NBC and ABC in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   In 1967 he moved to Los Angeles. He continued reporting in
California for several television stations until 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Renowned for his thunderous delivery, Dreier, who once weighed
more than 400 pounds, won seven Emmy Awards during his career.
</P>
<P>
   More recently he served as chairman of the board of the
Annenberg Center for Health Sciences in Rancho Mirage.
</P>
<P>
   He also served on the board of directors for the Eisenhower
Medical Center there.
</P>
<P>
   No immediate family members survive.

<HEADLINE>
EDITORIAL: ENLIGHTENED STEPS BY PATAKI 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, March 16:
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George Pataki of New York offered constructive proposals
this week on two issues he had previously neglected _ gun control
and ballot reform. The gun proposal probably ends any hope he once
had of receiving the Republican vice presidential nomination, but
these are good moves for New York that will help position Pataki as
a moderate should he seek a third term as governor.
</P>
<P>
   The legislative package on guns is still being worked on. But
its outline includes a ban on assault weapons, background checks
for guns purchased at gun shows and flea markets, raising the age
for purchasing guns from 18 to 21, ballistics fingerprinting of all
new guns to make it easier to trace guns used in crimes, and a
requirement that gun dealers provide a separate trigger lock with
every sale.
</P>
<P>
   The state Senate majority leader, Joseph Bruno, a Republican,
said Wednesday that his chamber was already preparing to act on
trigger locks and the assault weapons ban, and that he was open to
considering Pataki's other proposals _ an encouraging sign for
tangible progress this session.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki stops short of endorsing a strict limit on multiple
handgun purchases, as called for by President Clinton and Vice
President Al Gore. Nonetheless, in bucking the National Rifle
Association to protect public safety, the governor has set a
commendable example for other Republican governors and for
Republican leaders in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   On ballot issues, Pataki clearly heard the public's outrage when
he tried, unsuccessfully, to block Sen. John McCain from competing
statewide in the recent Republican presidential primary. The
aggressive ballot reform plan he unveiled Monday begins to make
amends for that shabby episode, even if it took pressure from Bruno
to finally goad the governor into action.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's bill would automatically put all recognized
candidates on the Republican presidential primary ballot, sparing
them the onerous petition process that poses a special obstacle for
insurgents. The measure would also end the state GOP's galling
practice of listing delegates' names in big type on the ballot,
with the presidential candidates listed below in small print.
Instead, voters would cast ballots directly for candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The plan's key flaw is that it would make the Republican contest
a winner-take-all affair _ an approach that would perpetuate the
overriding importance of backing from the party machine.

NICE-GUY ZAGS WANT TO PROVE THEY'RE NO FLUKE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON, Ariz. _ Let's face it. They're still a good story.
</P>
<P>
   And as much as they chafe and act suspicious about how the world
tries to turn them into the quaintest, greatest, underdogish little
basketball team in all of Division I, that's our story and we're
sticking to it.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzaga is back. A No. 10 seed again, but who's counting? They
are ready to roll against seventh-seeded Louisville this evening at
the McKale Center and we're here to say sorry to the Bulldogs from
Spokane.
</P>
<P>
   We know it makes them a little ornery to be treated like the
nice guys whose biggest, best contribution to the NCAA tournament
is to boost its purity quotient.
</P>
<P>
   Is there any reason to think otherwise when TV has put Gonzaga
on during prime time?
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Oklahoma, seeded third in the West, is stuck with a
morning start. Same with Purdue. The Boilermakers are seeded sixth
but their game against Dayton isn't marquee material.
</P>
<P>
   Not so the Zags. They are still the innocents, the darlings with
star appeal _ a notion that did not go unnoticed by their
Louisville opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We read the newspapers. We watch `SportsCenter.' We know
everyone's calling us the underdogs,'' Cardinals forward Tony
Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   ``USA Today came to my hotel doorstep and there wasn't anything
about Louisville in it. It was all about Gonzaga. But we'll show
you on the court what we think about all that.''
</P>
<P>
   No wonder the Zags wish their portrayal was a little different _
less Pollyanna and more piranha.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did lose a little toughness'' with the departure of 1999
tournament spark plug Quentin Hall and injured senior guard Mike
Nilson, senior guard Matt Santangelo said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there's a lot of fire in that locker room. A lot of people
have something to prove.''
</P>
<P>
   Prove? What could the
six-points-away-from-playing-in-the-1999-Final-Four Zags possibly
have left to prove?
</P>
<P>
   ``That last year wasn't a fluke,'' Santangelo said. ``There are
some people who will take it as it was _ an individual year where a
good basketball team got hot. But if we do it two years in a row,
then we're on our way to accomplishing our goal of establishing
tradition at Gonzaga.''
</P>
<P>
   Santangelo and his teammates valiantly try to retain their
refined edginess. But even they understand they can't quite pull
off the part.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure most people look at us and wouldn't find us to be the
most intimidating athletes,'' Gonzaga forward Casey Calvary said.
</P>
<P>
   And thank goodness, because the Zags still serve this important
role of lovable underdogs. They're the Little Engine That Could.
They are the antidote to the machines and the messes out there
littering the college basketball landscape.
</P>
<P>
   After all, here we are in the desert on the eve of the West
subregional. But instead of palm trees and happy-go-lucky
pretourney euphoria, it feels like we're stuck in the Garden of
Good and Evil.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it would be more polite to call it the Garden of Darkness
and Light. The entire college basketball season is reaching this
pinnacle stretch of March Madness in the throes of serious woes _
and the storm clouds aren't quite lifting.
</P>
<P>
   This college hoops season has been punctuated with NCAA probes
into cars, jewelry and prep school tuition. It has been all about
player suspensions and the subsequent name-calling by coaches and
the demand for change in the way ``student-athletes'' should be
compensated through their scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   Even as St. John's, the No. 2 seed in the West, was preparing
for its cross-country trip from New York, NCAA investigators were
peppering point guard Erick Barkley and forward Lavor Postell about
more possible NCAA violations.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the Johnnies are in the clear, which means they can go
far.
</P>
<P>
   And they arrived in the desert with an obvious public relations
campaign in regards to their sincerity and sweetness.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took care of business (with the NCAA questions) and we're
here to get back to academics and playing basketball,'' Postell
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``St. John's is a great institution. My kids are as fine of kids
as anywhere else in the country, be it Duke, North Carolina or
anywhere.'' St. John's coach Mike Jarvis said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They haven't done anything different. Trust me. All this
attention bestowed to us, we didn't ask for it and it might not
have happened if things were handled differently. But maybe
something good will come out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   It is the oddest thing, really. The teams with tarnished
reputations and uneasy standing with the NCAA are going out of
their way to create a good-guy image.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Zags are still trying to perfect their persona of
tough guys who won't back down to anyone, anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Mispronounce Gonzaga and they'll shoot a killer look.
</P>
<P>
   Assume that they aren't hungry enough to do what they did last
year, they'll aim to shoot your lights out.
</P>
<P>
   But just as soon as the Zags start to make you believe they're
slightly thuggish in their attitude, out comes a revelation that
returns them to their good-story status.
</P>
<P>
   When their flight from Spokane was delayed four hours, the Zags
arrived at their Tucson hotel Wednesday at 4 a.m. and were found
unpacking their own bags from the bus.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's standard Gonzaga behavior,'' coach Mark Few gushed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They unload their own bags. They'll sweep the floors. They'll
clean out the locker room. They're the kind of kids you hope as a
parent your kids grow up to be like,'' Few said.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's time for the fellas to try to live down their
boys-next-door reputations one more time.

EDITORIAL: DEATH BY LYNCHING 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, March 16:
</P>
<P>
   The walls of a room at the New York Historical Society are now
lined with small photographs of American lynchings. The victims are
mainly black, mainly Southern. Some of the photographs are
postcards and some are souvenirs that were printed by the dozens
and hundreds by commercial photographers who had been at the scene.
This exhibition, which chronicles an epidemic of lynchings in this
country between 1890 and 1930, is called ``Without Sanctuary:
Lynching Photography in America.'' It runs until July 9.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinarily museums are eager to spread the images they show on
their walls. They publish posters and postcards. They print
T-shirts and scarves. But there will be no postcards from this
exhibition, even though it is, in part, an exhibition of postcards.
One kind of viewing _ very different from the kind that these
photos originally elicited _ is being sanctioned here, as it is in
the accompanying book, and it is worth thinking about the meaning
of that difference.
</P>
<P>
   After all, at this exhibition we are a crowd looking at a crowd
looking at a lynching. And we are looking at the lynching too.
Again and again, a white mob looks back at us. Its members smile or
point or prod the corpse, or they merely settle for looking grim
and purposeful. In one extraordinary case, a black man about to be
lynched _ a man named Frank Embree, naked, bound and whipped until
bleeding _ looks back at us, beyond us too, challenging our moral
imagination across the years.
</P>
<P>
   This exhibition supplies knowledge of a fact that, though
public, was still historically hidden. These lynchings took place
in public and were often fomented by public men. These photographs
were publicly taken, openly owned. They usually show a body hanging
in a public place _ in a courthouse square, from the largest tree
in town, off a newly built bridge. They evince no shame and only
the self-consciousness the camera causes. But as a genre, a
category of images, they had largely retreated from sight until
now. They can be made public again only because now we ask them to
carry an utterly different meaning than they once did _ an outcry
against racism rather than a reinforcement of it.
</P>
<P>
   It is too simple to say that in our time and on these walls
these photographs embody shame, because they do not. Again and
again, a viewer looks to see what is in those white faces gathered
beneath the naked feet of a hanging dead man who was hideously
innocent. It is mostly satisfaction. The victims of these lynchings
were killed out of race hatred, out of loathing, out of blood lust.
But ultimately they were killed out of false knowledge, out of what
a mob thought it knew about guilt and innocence, law and justice,
white and black. That is the horror of these photographs. False
knowledge always seems so true at the time. &QL;

EDITORIAL: THE TRAGEDY OF MYANMAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, March 16:
</P>
<P>
   Few governments warrant isolation more than Myanmar's military
junta, one of the most brutal and repressive regimes in the world.
But the cruelty of Myanmar, formerly Burma, is increasingly a
regional problem that threatens to destabilize its Southeast Asian
neighbors with refugees, narcotics and now AIDS. Unfortunately,
Myanmar has faded from attention at a time when the need for
concerted action has never been greater.
</P>
<P>
   The latest disturbing news is that Myanmar's booming heroin
trade is contributing to the spread of AIDS in nearby countries,
notably India, China and Vietnam. Myanmar is the world's
second-largest source of opium and heroin, after Afghanistan. It
also has its own exploding epidemics of drug use and AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   The courageous opposition leader and 1991 Nobel peace laureate,
Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, an advocate of nonviolent resistance, remains
under strict government control in the capital, Yangon, formerly
called Rangoon. The government continues with a campaign of
harassment and imprisonment of her party, the National League for
Democracy, which won 80 percent of the parliamentary seats in a
1990 election that the junta then annulled.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years South Korea, the Philippines and Thailand have
replaced authoritarian regimes with fledgling democracies. Now
Indonesia has done the same. The changes present a fresh opening
for action on Myanmar, but the world has been slow to seize it. The
United Nations secretary-general, Kofi Annan, has yet to appoint a
new special envoy for Myanmar to coordinate international efforts
to bring pressure on the junta.
</P>
<P>
   The White House took the lead in isolating Myanmar, imposing
sanctions on new investment there in 1997. But the problem has not
been high on Washington's agenda for many months. The Association
of Southeast Asian Nations, which includes Myanmar, will meet in
July, and the Group of Eight leading industrial nations will gather
in Japan the same month. Tokyo continues to do business with
Myanmar's leaders. Washington should use the occasion of this
summer's meetings to persuade its democratic friends in the region
to shun Myanmar and make clear that normal trade and diplomatic
relations cannot be sustained as long as the government abuses its
people.

ZAGS' MIGHTY CASEY BEST WITH SPOTLIGHT SHINING BRIGHT 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Before Gonzaga discovered it was heading to Tucson for
its first game in the NCAA tournament, somebody wondered whether
Casey Calvary had a preference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is there any place you'd rather not go?'' he was asked.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo, Minneapolis, Cleveland ... they were all plausible
answers. But Calvary came up with the best reply, never hesitating,
proving that even off the court, he is quick on his feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Home,'' Calvary said, knowing that when Gonzaga falls, the
curtain will, too.
</P>
<P>
   Spokane is not the destination until April 4, the day after the
national championship game. Until then, Calvary's itinerary calls
for two more days in Tucson followed by a stop in Albuquerque on
the way to the Final Four in Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   This afternoon, dry-witted Calvary and his Gonzaga teammates go
from the deadpan to the fire, meeting Louisville in a West Region
first-round game. Just like last year, the Bulldogs are underdogs,
oddsmakers favoring Louisville by two points.
</P>
<P>
   A Cinderella short story? One-and-out from tourney-tested
Gonzaga? Maybe so or maybe not.
</P>
<P>
   The scenario is similar to last year when the Bulldogs came to
KeyArena, also as a No. 10 seed, and knocked off Minnesota. They
then beat second-seeded Stanford and proceeded to knock off Florida
before losing to eventual champion Connecticut. This year No. 2
seed St. John's likely looms in the second round.
</P>
<P>
   That would be an interesting matchup featuring Gonzaga's
goody-two-shoes against a St. John's team with two players, Erick
Barkley and Lavar Postell, being investigated by the NCAA for
possible infractions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have any ties with agents,'' Calvary said. ``There's
none of that stuff. It's a different program, so clean, so upright.
People know better than to talk to GU people. It's a waste of
time.''
</P>
<P>
   The straight arrows hit the bull's-eye last year. Calvary
climaxed the run by tipping in the game-winner against Florida,
creating a national following for the Bulldogs.
</P>
<P>
   It also led to heightened media interest, the kind of attention
that Calvary understands and appreciates. But he would prefer the
shadows to the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't take it too seriously,'' said his father, Roger.
``He'd much rather be with his friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Because he plays the game so well, Calvary is best known as a
6-foot-8 junior forward who can drift outside or bang underneath,
bringing intensity to every possession. Powerful in the paint, he's
Casey at the rack. Calvary is also athletic and active. He can
block shots. Scouts notice his range, jumping ability and desire.
</P>
<P>
   ``He plays with integrity and respects the game,'' said Billy
McKinney, Sonics executive vice president of basketball operations.
``You can't go wrong with drafting a player like that. I like him.
He could potentially be a first-round pick.''
</P>
<P>
   If that happens, the cameras, microphones and dot-coms will be
coming at him, seeking whatever is on his mind, searching for newsy
nuggets from his past. This is what they'll find:
</P>
<P>
   An Army brat who zig-Zagged around the country, if you will.
Born in Germany, Calvary spent time in Alabama and California
before his helicopter pilot dad landed at Fort Lewis when Casey was
in the fifth grade.
</P>
<P>
   It was then that Roger Calvary saw his youngest son begin to
dominate on the basketball court.
</P>
<P>
   ``He started guarding the whole other team,'' Roger said. ``I
had to get him to let his teammates cover their men. He said: `No,
dad, they're going to score.'''
</P>
<P>
   So the competitive Calvary showed up early.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even when we walked across the street, Casey had to get to the
other side first,'' Roger said.
</P>
<P>
   At Bellarmine Prep in Tacoma, Calvary distinguished himself as a
developing prospect, albeit a skinny one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him: `If you want to be an impact player, you're going
to have to find the weight room,''' Bellarmine coach Bernie Salazar
said. ``I only had to tell him once.''
</P>
<P>
   Calvary looks toned now, the muscles backing up his aggressive
nature. During one high school game against Foss, three Lions
verbally and physically harassed Calvary in the post.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's because he's a junior and people don't want to respect
his game,'' said Calvary's teammate, Damone Harrison. ``But they
will.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a coming attraction. Sir Mix-It-Up exchanged elbows and
shoves with Florida's Major Parker in the tournament last year.
Glares and snarls appeared on Calvary's face.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have an anger management problem,'' Calvary said in jest
after the game. ``Sometimes I want to turn these games into a
boxing match.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the gloves are always off elsewhere. Calvary enjoys spending
time with his girlfriend, Megan Hoseth, and hanging out with his
roommates, David Michelson and Riley Finnigan, former Bellarmine
classmates attending Eastern Washington University.
</P>
<P>
   Calvary is all of those hyphenated words rolled into one:
easy-going, laid-back, straight-forward. Supportive and sensitive
work, too.
</P>
<P>
   When Dan Monson took over as head coach at Gonzaga, he wondered
if Calvary would still sign a letter of intent. Calvary had been
recruited by outgoing coach Dan Fitzgerald.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado State wanted Calvary. So did Arizona and Stanford.
Calvary liked the small school feel and camaraderie at Gonzaga
whether Fitzgerald was there or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``He believed in me before anybody else did,'' said Monson, now
the coach at Minnesota. ``Casey will always be a special player to
me. Before I coached a game, he took a leap of faith in me.''
</P>
<P>
   Which made it extremely difficult for Monson to leave Gonzaga
last October. He preached loyalty to his players, and now he was
defecting in large part because of financial reasons, to secure his
family's future.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing I thought of was Casey,'' Monson said.
</P>
<P>
   How would he react? What would he say? They clicked from the
beginning, two strong-willed competitors who also shared, in
Monson's words, a ``screw-around side.''
</P>
<P>
   Monson walked into Gonzaga's gym, The Kennel, where the Bulldogs
were engaged in a pickup game of shirts-and-skins.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really uncomfortable,'' Monson said. ``I knew there
would be some feelings of betrayal. But as soon as the game was
over, Casey walked over and, all sweaty, gave me a great big hug.''
</P>
<P>
   Calvary also told Monson that if Minneapolis ever became lonely
and miserable to give him a call.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's tough back there, I'll talk to you,'' Calvary said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Casey's just Casey,'' Monson said.
</P>
<P>
   That being the case, you can expect Calvary to shine Thursday.
He puts up his biggest numbers against the toughest competition,
most recently reflected by the 28 points he scored against
Pepperdine in the West Coast Conference tournament championship.
After the game, Louisville coach Denny Crum probably will be
talking about how the Cardinals tried to stop him but couldn't.
</P>
<P>
   His parents and older brother, Andy, a senior at Washington
State, will be in their seats at McKale Center. Superstitious
supporters, his mom, Cathy, a history teacher at Mason Middle
School, will wear her lucky horseshoe belt and Andy will wear
basketball shorts that his brother gave him.
</P>
<P>
   In Minneapolis, Monson will be getting home from a recruiting
trip in Hutchinson, Kan., around 9 p.m. local time, right when
Gonzaga and Louisville are in the waning minutes. That's not a
problem: He plans to videotape the game and watch it without
knowing the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   And around the country, they will tune in to see if Calvary's
road trip and the Gonzaga magic continue.

BAD BACK TO KEEP ARIZONA'S WOODS OUT OF TOURNAMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM MOORE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ As blows go, this one would knock out any other
team but the Arizona Wildcats. Or so they contended Wednesday after
learning that Loren Woods will not play in the NCAA tournament
because of a back injury.
</P>
<P>
   Woods is expected to make a full recovery, but he needs more
rest to heal a compressed disc. The 7-foot-1 junior center believes
he suffered the injury Jan. 26 at Arizona State and aggravated it
five games later on Feb. 12 at Washington State.
</P>
<P>
   ``It got worse when I fell in Pullman,'' Woods said.
</P>
<P>
   A transfer from Wake Forest, Woods was the Pac-10 newcomer of
the year and probably would have been player of the year had he not
missed Arizona's last six games.
</P>
<P>
   He averaged 15.6 points and 7.5 rebounds but was even more of a
factor as a shot-blocker and intimidator who turned away
trespassers in the lane. Woods blocked a school-record 102 shots,
including 14 in one game against Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   Woods' absence changes everything and nothing for the Wildcats,
who at least are accustomed to adversity. Because of injuries and
transfers and personal decisions, Arizona, which opens tournament
play Thursday against Jackson State, went most of the season with
seven scholarship players. For the most part, the Wildcats
responded.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like something has changed for us because it's been
this way for so long,'' said coach Lute Olson.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona overcame the biggest setback _ Richard Jefferson's
broken foot _ to earn a share of the Pac-10 title with Stanford.
The Wildcats defeated Stanford once without Jefferson and did it
again last Thursday without Woods.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson, a sophomore forward, returned March 2 after missing
nearly two months and has played in four games. His body took a
jolt, but his confidence was intact Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can beat a No. 1 seed without Loren, we can beat anybody
in the country,'' Jefferson said.
</P>
<P>
   Added Woods: ``We still have a chance to win the national
championship. But taking me out of the equation hurts a little
bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Olson said the Wildcats should not be affected on offense.
Without Woods, power forward Michael Wright has more room to
maneuver inside. Justin Wessel can operate more effectively on the
perimeter. Bill Walton's son, Luke, should continue to flash his
all-around savvy.
</P>
<P>
   With gifted freshman guards Jason Gardner and Gilbert Arenas
sprinting through seams and pulling up for 3s, Arizona has ample
scorers.
</P>
<P>
   But the Wildcats won't have the one-man clean-up crew at the
defensive end. Arizona can't gamble on the wings because Woods
isn't there anymore to help out. With Woods, Arizona limited
opponents to less than 40-percent shooting. Without him, all six
opponents shot better than 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Defiant nonetheless, the West's No. 1 seed carries on. Woods
will remain an example on the bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still a leader, still a captain,'' he said. ``I can't be
moping. My teammates see that and it will be lost hope for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati was severely weakened by the loss of Kenyon Martin,
the national player of the year who broke his right leg last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to have a Cincinnati situation here,'' Woods
said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he had played his last game with Arizona, Woods, a
certain lottery pick if he were to leave a year early, gave a vague
reply.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now I'm not thinking about that. It's too big of a
distraction,'' Woods said, knowing there have been enough already.

TIE HURTS DUCKS MORE THAN KINGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG CHRISTENSEN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ Another night, another opportunity lost for the Mighty
Ducks in their frustrating attempt to battle back into the Western
Conference playoff race.
</P>
<P>
   Desperately needing two points, the Ducks had to settle for one
in a 2-2 tie with the Kings before a sellout crowd of 17,174 at The
Pond on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The point moved Anaheim ahead of Calgary into sole possession of
ninth place, but the Ducks fell six points back of San Jose and
Edmonton.
</P>
<P>
   Firmly entrenched in a playoff spot, the fifth-place Kings moved
two points ahead of Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, Wednesday was a microcosm of the Ducks' season:
They outplayed their opponent but blew a two-goal lead and lost
ground in the playoff race.
</P>
<P>
   With only 11 games remaining, Ducks coach Craig Hartsburg said
there's no time to dwell on results, especially with San Jose
coming to town Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great game,'' he said. ``I thought we were good for
65 minutes. We played our hearts out, and that's all I can ask. We
would have liked two points, but now we have to get ready for San
Jose.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks outshot the Kings 39-22 and, to make the result even
more frustrating, they were unable to score on a 4-on-3 power play
in overtime. Two Kings broke their sticks at one point, but Jamie
Storr stopped both Paul Kariya and Fredrik Olausson on great
scoring chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had the puck in the slot and were firing away, what are you
going to do?'' Hartsburg asked.
</P>
<P>
   It's getting close to do-or-die time for the Ducks, and that
added intensity showed, especially in Anaheim's physical style of
play. Rookie defenseman Vitaly Vishnevski was especially active,
knocking Ziggy Palffy out of the game in the third period with a
clean check that sent the Kings' star winger to the dressing room
in the third period with a strained right shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a playoff game,'' Hartsburg said. ``I don't think
either coach could ask for much more from his team.''
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim led 2-0 in the first period on goals by Steve Rucchin
and Oleg Tverdovsky, on the second and third shots of the game.
</P>
<P>
   But no lead is a safe lead with the Ducks these days.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Smolinski turned the game back around by himself. He
pulled the Kings within 2-1 with his 19th goal of the season at
9:40 of the first period. He tied the score when he ripped a slap
shot from the high slot that appeared to skip just before Hebert
and beat him inside the left post 59 seconds into the second
period.
</P>
<P>
   The first Anaheim power play of the night was headed in reverse
until Tverdovsky took a big hit to keep the puck in at the left
point. The Ducks defenseman slid it over to Olausson and his
harmless-looking wrist shot was deflected past Storr by Rucchin at
4:02.
</P>
<P>
   Rucchin's 16th goal of the season was the 100th of his career.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks' second power-play goal came much easier. The Kings
left Tverdovsky alone in the left circle, and he had virtually all
day to beat Storr for his 13th goal of the season at 8:53, just 19
seconds after Ian Laperriere had elbowed Jeff Nielsen.
</P>
<P>
   But the Ducks' two-goal advantage was short lived. Glen Murray
passed the puck to Smolinski, who drove hard to the net and beat
Hebert just inside the right post.
</P>
<P>
   The goal was just the second in 14 games for Smolinski, whose
only other goal in recent weeks was an empty-netter.
</P>
<P>
   After giving up the two early goals, Storr answered every
Anaheim challenge. In the first period the Kings' goalie stopped
Kariya on a 2-on-1 break, just barely got a toe on the wraparound
try by Matt Cullen and kicked out his left leg pad just in time to
stop Kip Miller's bid from the slot.
</P>
<P>
   In the second period, Kariya made a great move to split the
Kings' defense, but Storr got his glove on the Anaheim winger's
shot.
</P>
<P>
   Hebert was knocked out of the St. Louis game last Saturday and
hadn't practiced since, but he looked especially sharp after
Smolinski's second goal. In less than a minute midway through
second period he stopped both Murray and Nelson Emerson twice. &QL;

   In the 1950 census, America was 89 percent white and 10 percent
black. Other races hardly got a passing glance. Now Latinos account
for around 12 percent of the population; within the next five
years, they will overtake blacks to become the largest minority
group. This survey will seek to answer three fundamental questions:
Is the melting pot still working? Is it good for America? And how

   America's immigration law is rather like a hedgehog: it has a
hard, prickly exterior, but its center is surprisingly soft. The
rules that govern immigrants' entry into America and their legal
status thereafter are, in turn, contradictory, disingenuous,
hypocritical, downright cruel and ridiculously overly generous.
Were they to be efficiently enforced, the result would be total
chaos. &QL;

   Like so many other revolutions, America's ethnic make-over
officially dates back to 1965, when Congress dropped the hated
national quotas it had imposed in the 1920s. Instead, it brought in
quotas that favored family ties. In some ways the act was a
surrender to the status quo. Today, most immigrants fall into one
of five categories. &QL;

   Yes, most of the evidence suggests that the current wave of
immigration is good for America. But it is not good for everybody;
and the general benefits are often harder to identify than the
specific costs. Broadly speaking, though, most of the numbers
indicate that in the long term America gains from immigration _ but
that the immigrants gain even more. &QL;

   Is the hyphenated American (e.g., Mexican-American) giving way
to the ampersand one (Mexican &AMP; American)? A recent poll by the
Washington Post of 2,500 Latinos showed that nine out of ten who
have newly arrived in America think it is important to change to
fit in. But nine out of ten also think it is important to retain
part of their ethnic culture. With third-generation Latinos, this
proportion rises to 98 percent. &QL;

   ``Today's learner is tomorrow's leader.'' The motto of Public
School 220 in Queens, N.Y., would do nicely for most New Americans.
Many of the notes pinned on the school's bulletin boards _ sample:
``Snowflakes are different, and so are we'' _ hint at the
challenges of trying to teach students who between them speak 26
foreign languages at home. Bilingual education is only part of the
problem, but it is indicative of the raw deal immigrants are
getting from America's education system. &QL;

   Latinos in America control around $300 billion of spending
power, and Asians another $100 billion. Yet immigrant groups
complain about being patronized or ignored by mainstream business.
This will change, if only because the newcomers, being young, will
play a growing part in setting the trends. As the editor of Latina,
a magazine for young girls, explained to Newsweek: ``Blacks said
`We will overcome.' Our motto is `We will overwhelm.''' &QL;

   Latino politicians in America are finding power elusive because
their supporters will not turn out at elections. Despite its large
Latino community, Los Angeles is still essentially run by Jews and
blacks. In national politics, Latinos make up only around 7 percent
of the likely voters, half the figure for blacks, but they may
punch above their weight in the presidential election later this
year. &QL;

   Thanks to immigration, America has once again assembled a team
of people who have shown their willingness to compete and their
belief in the American Dream. Look around the United States _ not
only at the affluent Indian programmers in Silicon Valley and the
newly self-confident Latino middle class in Los Angeles, but at the
undernourished Uzbek children in Queens or the wretched Tejanos on
the Texas/Mexico border _ and you will find the drive is still
there. The rest of the country must not waste it. &QL;

   Like so many other revolutions, America's ethnic make-over
officially dates back to 1965, when Congress dropped the hated
national quotas it had imposed in the 1920s. Instead, it brought in
quotas that favored family ties. In some ways the act was a
surrender to the status quo. Today, most immigrants fall into one
of five categories. &QL;

   Yes, most of the evidence suggests that the current wave of
immigration is good for America. But it is not good for everybody;
and the general benefits are often harder to identify than the
specific costs. Broadly speaking, though, most of the numbers
indicate that in the long term America gains from immigration _ but
that the immigrants gain even more. &QL;

   Is the hyphenated American (e.g., Mexican-American) giving way
to the ampersand one (Mexican &AMP; American)? A recent poll by the
Washington Post of 2,500 Latinos showed that nine out of ten who
have newly arrived in America think it is important to change to
fit in. But nine out of ten also think it is important to retain
part of their ethnic culture. With third-generation Latinos, this
proportion rises to 98 percent. &QL;

   ``Today's learner is tomorrow's leader.'' The motto of Public
School 220 in Queens, N.Y., would do nicely for most New Americans.
Many of the notes pinned on the school's bulletin boards _ sample:
``Snowflakes are different, and so are we'' _ hint at the
challenges of trying to teach students who between them speak 26
foreign languages at home. Bilingual education is only part of the
problem, but it is indicative of the raw deal immigrants are
getting from America's education system. &QL;

   Latinos in America control around $300 billion of spending
power, and Asians another $100 billion. Yet immigrant groups
complain about being patronized or ignored by mainstream business.
This will change, if only because the newcomers, being young, will
play a growing part in setting the trends. As the editor of Latina,
a magazine for young girls, explained to Newsweek: ``Blacks said
`We will overcome.' Our motto is `We will overwhelm.''' &QL;

   Latino politicians in America are finding power elusive because
their supporters will not turn out at elections. Despite its large
Latino community, Los Angeles is still essentially run by Jews and
blacks. In national politics, Latinos make up only around 7 percent
of the likely voters, half the figure for blacks, but they may
punch above their weight in the presidential election later this
year. &QL;

   Thanks to immigration, America has once again assembled a team
of people who have shown their willingness to compete and their
belief in the American Dream. Look around the United States _ not
only at the affluent Indian programmers in Silicon Valley and the
newly self-confident Latino middle class in Los Angeles, but at the
undernourished Uzbek children in Queens or the wretched Tejanos on
the Texas/Mexico border _ and you will find the drive is still
there. The rest of the country must not waste it. &QL;

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Why refugees ride the waves
 &HT;    (For release March 19, 2000.)
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   As with the American economy, the rich of the Dominican Republic
are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer, even desperate.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S., of course, operates at a higher level (of richness and
poverty), and being dirt poor in the Dominican Republic is being,
well, dirt poor.
</P>
<P>
   In the Dominican Republic today, it is estimated that 60 percent
of the population lives in poverty. As pointed out in a recent
Miami Herald article, the per-capita income is $1,600 a year. In
the U.S., the amount is $27,000.
</P>
<P>
   President Leonel Fernandez, who cannot seek re-election in May,
has had a partly fruitful reign in that he has introduced modern
life to the country; computers, telephones, education programs.
Along with that, Fernandez has opened his country to foreign
investment, and it has been pouring in.
</P>
<P>
   Santo Domingo is undergoing a building boom, tourism is at its
best ever and the Dominican Republic is seen as the area's
fastest-growing economy.
</P>
<P>
   Why, then, are there boat people? Why are Dominicans risking
their lives _ often losing them _ to get to Puerto Rico and what
they consider to be greater economic opportunities?
</P>
<P>
   The word ``oligarchy'' comes into play. An oligarchy occurs when
a relatively few people hold all the power. An oligarchy was when
the Somoza family ruled Nicaragua from 1937 until 1979. What has
happened in the Dominican Republic is not an oligarchy in the sense
of the same people being in unremitting power. Instead, it is a
nation where the political pendulum has swung far in either
direction, yet despite that diversity of government, everything
seems to stay the same for most of the people.
</P>
<P>
   It reminds me of Ronald Reagan's attempt at a ``trickle-down
economy'' that became more of a ``trickle-up economy,'' the rich
getting richer and the poor, at best, staying in place. That
situation still permeates the American economy. Our levels of
poverty remain constant while at already existing upper echelons,
the profits become greater.
</P>
<P>
   The boat people of the Dominican Republic represent those who
have exhausted every possible chance of living within the existing
economy. Their desperation for a better life is so great that they
gamble with small boats in a body of water notorious for its swift
currents.
</P>
<P>
   Often the results are disastrous. This month, heavy surf ripped
apart a wooden vessel carrying 70 people toward Puerto Rico. At
least 10 died and as many as 30 are missing.
</P>
<P>
   In January, a similar incident happened. It is estimated that
5,000 undocumented Dominicans have reached Puerto Rico in the past
two years and scampered into the countryside. The estimates of
those who have lost their lives in the attempt reach into the
hundreds.
</P>
<P>
   What does that have to say about the Dominican Republic's
ascending stature as an economic success? What it tells me is that
the folks already at the top _ the economic oligarchy _ are having
wonderful days while the others look across the treacherous
75-mile-wide Canal de la Mona for their better days.
</P>
<P>
   The movement of peoples throughout the Caribbean Basin is now
and always has been about economics. The boatloads of Cubans who
take aim at South Florida are coming here to make for a better
life; they really are apolitical.
</P>
<P>
   I am somewhat reminded of a time long ago when I was speaking
with an Arab merchant who was selling goat heads in the Arab
Quarter of Jerusalem. The Israelis had recently taken the city and
I asked the gnarled old merchant what that meant to him.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't mention politics, and not a word about Allah. ``I
don't care who runs the place,'' he told me. ``I just want to make
a living.''
</P>
<P>
   This is what moves people around the Caribbean, principally
toward U.S. territories. They just want to make a living. The
economic oligarchies of the region often make that unobtainable.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: PETA milks its sacred cows
 &HT;    (Eds: Please note the clarification of a previous column at the
end of this column.)
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Good news. Beer is health food.
</P>
<P>
   To thank for this welcome intelligence, we have, oddly, the
organization People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.
</P>
<P>
   PETA is running ads that mimic the milk mongers' famous ad
featuring milk mustaches on over-hyped celebrities. Where the dairy
industry asks, ``Got milk?,'' the animal rights folks ask, ``Got
beer?''
</P>
<P>
   The ads are to run in college newspapers and are just one more
sign that today's youth are a sorry lot. When I was in college, we
didn't need any prodding to drink beer. What is the world coming
to?
</P>
<P>
   PETA is busily trying to explain that it is not really promoting
campus boozing but means only to discourage the nation's youth from
falling into the wastrel ways of imbibing milk. PETA spokesfolk say
college kids are savvy enough to get the right message without
thinking PETA really-really wants them to start pouring beer over
their Cap'n Crunch.
</P>
<P>
   The better choice for college students, PETA says, is soy milk.
PETA is serious about that.
</P>
<P>
   Dairy industry people insist that a happy cow gives more and
better milk than a peeved one, so farmers, far from annoying their
herds, are doing all they can to jolly up the ladies.
</P>
<P>
   PETA, however, has got it into its head that 1) actual milk is
bad for you _ the fat, you know _ and 2) milking cows is animal
abuse, a sort of bovine sexual harassment in the workplace, I
guess.
</P>
<P>
   This sets up a bit of a problem. Inasmuch as, if we shouldn't
milk cows, then we certainly shouldn't eat them _ eating them is
even more abusive _ just what are we to do with all these cows?
Perhaps, given PETA's sensitivity, take up a collection to send
them to St. Tropez and wish them happy grazing.
</P>
<P>
   While that is being worked out, Mothers Against Drunk Driving
has come utterly unglued. (Did you notice I didn't write
``udderly''? Do I get credit for that?)
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for MADD says her organization is concerned and
appalled, which, when you think about it, MADD usually is.
</P>
<P>
   Neither PETA nor MADD is known for its sense of whimsy, so what
we have here is a clash of titans, of a sort, as two of the
nation's most monumentally earnest organizations collide. It is as
if the Anti-Saloon League and the Ethical Culturalists were
fighting it out on World Wrestling Federation. The action is
amusing, and whichever outfit prevails, not much harm will be done.
</P>
<P>
   The only disappointment is that PETA shied from declaring
beer-drinking what it actually is _ liquid vegetarianism. Maybe
those ads are in the works.
</P>
<P>
   NOTE: In a recent column, I cited President Clinton's claim that
13 children a day die from gunshots, some 4,700 annually. ``Youths
and children'' would be more accurate, and Clinton's numbers were a
year or so out of date. Based on data from a 1998 report by the
Center for Health Statistics, the daily average was 11.5, or about
4,200 a year, aged 19 and younger.

US COMPANIES PEDDLE AERIAL IMAGES OF NUCLEAR SITES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN DONNELLY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When John Pike began examining new satellite photos
of Pakistan's nuclear missile site, he expected to find ``two
warehouses inside a fence.'' Instead, he discovered a whole
well-developed military base.
</P>
<P>
   Pike is a civilian who works for a private scientific group. His
disclosure of the Pakistan images Wednesday not only has
implications for US foreign policy, but more broadly shows that
obtaining and analyzing such sophisticated satellite images is now
possible for anyone _ for a price.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, you had to be a superpower to produce this
imagery,'' said Pike, who is a defense analyst for the Federation
of American Scientists. ``Now just about anyone can order it. It's
a lot of fun, almost illegally fun.''
</P>
<P>
   The Federation, an arms control organization, has used grant
money from the Rockefeller and MacArthur foundations to begin
purchasing photographs that show details down to a yard across of
chemical, biological and nuclear facilities around the world.
</P>
<P>
   So far, they have analyzed and released pictures of sites in
North Korea and Pakistan. Next they hope to buy pictures of sites
in India, Iran, Syria, Egypt, and the so-called Area 51 in Nevada,
a top-secret US military base.
</P>
<P>
   The group purchased the pictures from Space Imagery Inc. of
Thornton, Colo., a forerunner in the commercial spy satellite
business that is just now going public. Soon, as many as three
other US companies will be peddling high-resolution imagery.
</P>
<P>
   The cost is high: a minimum of $1,000 per order for US sites,
$2,000 for foreign sites. But the possibilities for using
high-resolution photographs are large.
</P>
<P>
   Real estate agents can show neighborhoods to prospective buyers.
Disaster relief organizations can use them as guides in
emergencies. Or governments can use them to gather intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   Under US law, anyone can buy pictures of every country in the
world except Israel. Terror groups or countries designated by the
State Department as sponsoring terrorism can't buy the pictures.
And the secretary of defense or state can order an area of the
world off-limits to commercial sales in times of emergency, such as
a war.
</P>
<P>
   Since Space Imagery launched its satellite last fall, US
officials have yet to impose any limits. One challenge of US
openness will come over the request to photograph Area 51, a base
long used to test new aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is sanguine about the selling of spy pictures, or
about civilians such as Pike interpreting data without more sources
of information.
</P>
<P>
   ``This can be abused by people who don't have access to overhead
imagery to increase the danger they pose to the United States or to
our allies,'' said Frank J. Gaffney, a former senior Pentagon
official in the Reagan administration and now president of Center
For Security Policy, a conservative Washington think-tank. ``That
would most obviously be the case when somebody might be able to do
a proverbial `Hail Mary' pass overhead and see where our military
forces are deployed.''
</P>
<P>
   Gaffney said the Federation of American Scientists' analysis
also would ``suffer inevitably from an inability to have access to
a package of what is called sources and methods. You can very
easily make wrong-headed conclusions.''
</P>
<P>
   But Pike and Corey Gay Hinderstein, a policy analyst at the
Institute for Science and International Security, a Washington
think-tank specializing on nuclear proliferation issues, said they
carefully confine their analysis to what seems probable or
possible.
</P>
<P>
   The photographs, Pike said, ``level the playing field between
the government and the electorate. I hope these images do for
public policy debate what they did for the classified intelligence
community 40 years ago: substitute fact for speculation.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a field like this, the imbalance of information between the
public decision-makers and the public gets so profound that people
inside government can ignore outsiders because the outsiders don't
really know what they're talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pakistan pictures confirmed the existence of a heavy-water
facility to produce plutonium and revealed the larger-than-expected
military facility. Pictures of India's nuclear sites have been
delayed because of cloud cover, Pike said.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of the nuclear tests done by India and Pakistan
in 1998, US policy has been aimed at making both countries walk
away from their nuclear programs. In President Clinton's trip next
week to the region, he is expected to raise the issue with both
Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Pakistani General
Pervez Musharraf, who seized power in a coup last October.
</P>
<P>
   But Pike said the satellite pictures of Pakistan's buildup at
the plutonium reactor at Khushab and the nearby missile base at
Sargodha in the central part of the nation show the low odds of
Pakistan simply giving up its program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Say they had a few missiles and a few warehouses,'' Pike said
in an interview. ``You could see how you could persuade them to
shut down. But to shut down a whole base? This is not something the
Pakistanis did inadvertantly and now you can kick them in the shins
and tell them to put it away.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the Federation released pictures of North
Korea's Rodong base, the country's lone site for launching
long-range missiles. The pictures showed what seemed to be a
primitive rural site with only small patches of paved roads, little
security, no rail link.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's remarkably modest,'' Pike said. ``The facility we see
today in North Korea for missile testing is not consistent with
what would be a more rigorous, robust training program.''
</P>
<P>
   The photographs are viewable on line on the Federation's
website, www.fas.org.

 &HT;    I'm behind a lens again, but it's temporary
 &HT;    By Gary Borders
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NACOGDOCHES, Texas _ I'm too old to be doing this: Climbing up a
metal ladder onto a catwalk above the basketball floor at Johnson
Coliseum on the SFA campus to turn on the remote flashes my former
photographer set up to deliver ``Sports Illustrated'' shots of
games here. I tippy-toe along the catwalk, illogically convinced I
will plunge to my death at any second through the mesh steel, my
only consolation being I'm likely to make the front page if that
happens. Descending safely, I sit on a hardwood floor, propping up
an impossibly heavy camera on my shoulder. This camera is
technologically so far advanced beyond my capabilities as to not be
terribly funny.
</P>
<P>
   The fear of falling through the catwalk reminds me of a recent
encounter at the country club, when several of us were deep in our
cups and talking about a golf trip via a single-engine airplane to
Louisiana. This was not long after Payne Stewart, one of my golf
heroes, died when his Lear jet went down. A friend was criticizing
our headline, which read, ``Golfer Payne Stewart, four others, die
in air crash.'' He took umbrage at relegating the others to ``four
other'' status. I don't disagree, one life being as important as
another and all that. Still, I pointed out, since he was the pilot
on this vaguely planned trip, that if we crashed, in our newspaper
the headline would read: ``Sentinel publisher, three others, die in
plane crash.'' Hey, it's an imperfect business.
</P>
<P>
   My back hurts. I'm sleepy. People in the audience keep coming up
to me and asking what exactly am I doing down there on the floor
taking photos, my hat on backward because otherwise the camera
knocks it off when turned vertically.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is, Dave quit. Dang that Dave. He's in love and gone to
Houston to get married, after shooting for us for five years. Dave
is a fine shooter, even-tempered and fairly normal for a
photographer. My only tense moment with Dave was when I realized he
had been wearing the same pair of jeans with holes at the knees for
five days. I called him in and told him he would be covering
junior-high volleyball in Bobo if he didn't change pants. He said,
``Cool, dude,'' and changed pants.
</P>
<P>
   Dave fell in love and left town, and I'm sure he will do well,
both in marriage and in his career. He has the eye, which is what
counts in photography. The technical stuff is easy. You're born
with the eye.
</P>
<P>
   I speak from experience. I started in this business as a
photographer, 30 years ago, as a part-timer for the Longview Daily
News. I worked for four different papers as a photographer/writer,
got a master's in photojournalism from UT, and then figured out I
didn't have the eye _ at least not good enough to make the big
leagues _ and so I went into management. Now I'm a jack of all
trades, master of none, knowing a tad about photography,
advertising, layout and accounting. And on this Tuesday night, with
Dave gone and all our free-lancers on vacation, I'm spending an
evening first shooting soccer, then basketball. This is great.
</P>
<P>
   It won't be great if I have to do it for the next several weeks.
My job is meetings, management, editing and public relations. I'm
not the day-to-day guy, except for the editorial page, which I
still personally produce each day. We need a shooter, another Dave.
In the meantime, we're relying heavily on a former photographer,
Hardy, and the reporters to take pictures. And me, in a pinch.
</P>
<P>
   I have fallen in love with this camera, which costs more than my
first house out in the woods. It's completely digital, meaning it
records images on a computer card instead of on film. You can take
a photo and then look at it on a tiny screen on the back of the
camera, so once you have an acceptable photo you can leave.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble is, my brief lesson from Hardy went in one ear and out
the other, and I spent a panicked afternoon before heading to the
sports events reading the owner's manual trying to figure out what
the 9 bejillion buttons on the camera did. I still don't know what
90 percent of the buttons do, but I figured out enough to get a
couple of acceptable shots for the paper. Since then, I've been
sent back out to shoot a front-page photo and plan to take pictures
on election night.
</P>
<P>
   Playing at being a photographer again has been fun, but I liken
it to having a grandbaby, which luckily I don't have just yet.
After a few days, I'm about ready to hand this baby back to someone
who actually knows what he's doing. Or she's doing. We've
interviewed a few prospects and hope to have someone in the job in
a few weeks. Until then, if you see me wandering around with a
camera bag weighing me down and a confused look on my face as I try
to figure out how to work the camera, pay no mind. We'll have
someone qualified here as soon as possible.

 &HT;    Things a Texan won't say
 &HT;    By Ernest Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ Texans are a different breed. I know because
I've never lived anywhere else, and on those occasions when I do
travel out of state, I always feel a sense of relief when I'm
safely back on Texas soil. I have this fear that if I should die
outside Texas, I'd have to be wrapped up in gauze and carried back
to Texas like Gus McRae in ``Lonesome Dove.''
</P>
<P>
   But while Texans take their state seriously, we're not above
enjoying a joke or two at our expense. Here's an e-mail I received
from a friend who wasn't born in Texas, but he got here as quickly
as he could.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how far from home they are, there are some things
you'll never hear a Texan say:
</P>
<P>
   _ I'll take Shakespeare for 1,000, Alex.
</P>
<P>
   _ Duct tape won't fix that.
</P>
<P>
   _ Lisa Marie was lucky to catch Michael.
</P>
<P>
   _ Come to think of it, I'll have a Heineken.
</P>
<P>
   _ We don't keep firearms in this house.
</P>
<P>
   _ Has anybody seen the sideburns trimmer?
</P>
<P>
   _ You can't feed that to the dog.
</P>
<P>
   _ I thought Graceland was tacky.
</P>
<P>
   _ No kids in the back of the pickup, it's just not safe.
</P>
<P>
   _ Wrasslin's fake.
</P>
<P>
   _ Honey, did you mail that donation to Greenpeace?
</P>
<P>
   _ We're vegetarians.
</P>
<P>
   _ Do you think my gut is too big?
</P>
<P>
   _ I'll have grapefruit and grapes instead of biscuits and gravy.
</P>
<P>
   _ Honey, we don't need another dog.
</P>
<P>
   _ Who's Richard Petty?
</P>
<P>
   _ Give me the small bag of pork rinds.
</P>
<P>
   _ Too many deer heads detract from the decor.
</P>
<P>
   _ Spittin' is such a nasty habit.
</P>
<P>
   _ I just couldn't find a thing at Wal-Mart today.
</P>
<P>
   _ Trim the fat off the steak.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cappuccino tastes better than espresso.
</P>
<P>
   _ The tires on that truck are too big.
</P>
<P>
   _ I'll have the arugula and radicchio salad.
</P>
<P>
   _ Unsweetened tea tastes better.
</P>
<P>
   _ Would you like your fish poached or broiled?
</P>
<P>
   _ My fiance, Bobbie Jo, is registered at Tiffany's.
</P>
<P>
   _ I've got two cases of Zima for the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   _ Little Debbie snack cakes have too many fat grams.
</P>
<P>
   _ Checkmate.
</P>
<P>
   _ She's too young to be wearing a bikini.
</P>
<P>
   _ Does the salad bar have bean sprouts?
</P>
<P>
   _ Hey, here's an episode of ``Hee Haw'' that we haven't seen.
</P>
<P>
   _ I don't have a favorite college team.
</P>
<P>
   _ Be sure to bring my salad dressing on the side.
</P>
<P>
   _ I believe you cooked those green beans too long.
</P>
<P>
   _ Those shorts ought to be a little longer, Darlin'.
</P>
<P>
   _ Nope, no more for me. I'm drivin' tonight.

 &HT;    We get letters, sometimes ugly, nasty ones
 &HT;    By Arnold Garcia
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ There are a lot of things to like about this
job, but what I like most is the mail the end of a campaign
generates.
</P>
<P>
   My favorites are the ones that end: ``I'll bet you don't have
the guts to print this'' and signed ``Concerned Citizen.''
</P>
<P>
   We get a lot of mail from ol' Concerned and his cousin ``Irate
Taxpayer'' year-round, but they get especially worked up when the
end of a campaign approaches and things aren't developing quite as
they would like. So, they send me mail in the closing days of a
campaign spilling nasty little secrets of candidates they oppose.
</P>
<P>
   The anonymous ones bemuse and amuse me. While we often use
anonymous letters for internal enjoyment, we don't print them and
never have.
</P>
<P>
   I wonder why someone would pour so much work into a tome and
then shun credit for it. Or is it taking responsibility that scares
these champions of democracy and the American way?
</P>
<P>
   Then there are those who do have the gumption to sign the cheap
shots they want to throw right before an election and demand to
know why we don't use them.
</P>
<P>
   Well, the would-be contributors have known since January that
the source of their distress is on the ballot, so I don't feel any
particular obligation to lend my support to their last-minute
spleen venting. Moreover, we have developed a policy over the years
to go dark on campaign letters 48 hours before an election.
</P>
<P>
   I generally don't like making rules, because some idiot is going
to follow them right past the point of absurdity. But this is one
with which I'm more than comfortable because as much as I dislike
rules, I hate ambushes more.
</P>
<P>
   In the last week, I've gotten letters about a couple of
candidates and their private lives, night lives and work habits.
The down-and-dirty ones have been anonymous, and I got of couple of
signed ones that were just downright mean-spirited.
</P>
<P>
   This is such a small town that there wasn't any breaking news in
those letters. I'd heard the gossip before. In fact, collecting
gossip is a hobby of mine, so there isn't much in the way of
lowdown and dirty talk that surprises me.
</P>
<P>
   Unless the rumors involve aethist space aliens who are
conspiring with Jim Bob Moffett to pave heaven and confiscate guns
along the way, we make an effort to check them out. If there is
something to them, you read about it. If not, you don't.
</P>
<P>
   And as far as the anonymous letters go, I follow my momma's
counsel and consider the source.

 &HT;    Offutt shown the door, and other election stories
 &HT;    By Dave McNeely
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Perhaps the biggest lesson in Tuesday's
primaries was for State Board of Education District 5 member Bob
Offutt: Don't tug on Superman's cape.
</P>
<P>
   Offutt, the pediatric dentist from San Antonio who leads the
ultra-conservative faction on the board showed up in Iowa and New
Hampshire with former board member Donna Ballard to criticize Bush
on education and endorse Steve Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, Dan Montgomery, a retired social studies teacher from
Fredericksburg who'd filed against Offutt, began getting
contributions from Bush friends. Darned if Montgomery didn't get 59
percent _ which at year's end will take Offutt's hands out of
school matters and return them exclusively to kids' mouths. In
other races this week:
</P>
<P>
   Senate District 3 _ Rep. Todd Staples of Palestine won a
surprising 70 percent over Conroe homebuilder Les Tarrance and
also-ran Van Brookshire of Coldspring. Staples won Tarrance's home
base of Montgomery County by a 51-33 ratio.
</P>
<P>
   The seat, where Republican Drew Nixon of Carthage is retiring,
is important because Republicans hold a narrow 16-15 edge in the
Senate. Staples' rural base is considered a plus against Democrat
David Fisher of Silsbee in November.
</P>
<P>
   Senate District 2 _ In the other Senate seat in play in the
partisan balance, Republicans Ron Deuell of Greenville and Richard
Harvey of Tyler will face off April 10 to see who opposes incumbent
Democrat David Cain of Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   San Antonio House Carnage _ Two incumbent San Antonio members of
the Texas House were defeated, and a third is threatened.
</P>
<P>
   Republican incumbent Bill Siebert was handily vanquished by
Elizabeth Ames Jones, who got 66 percent. Siebert was punished
primarily for brazenly lobbying for clients before San Antonio's
City Council.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic incumbent Juan F. Solis, who got distracted by
becoming involved in Robby Vazquez's effort to win a vacant House
seat, lost 51-49 to Jose Menendez.
</P>
<P>
   And Democratic incumbent Leo Alvarado Jr., who lost his own
district in a special Senate election against Leticia Van de Putte,
was thrown into a runoff. He'll face Trey Martinez Fischer.
</P>
<P>
   Vazquez, running for the House seat vacated by Van de Putte,
lost to Mike Villareal, who was backed by former San Antonio Mayor
Henry Cisneros.
</P>
<P>
   Van de Putte, meanwhile, got 54 percent to stand off a strong
primary challenge for the Senate District 26 seat from David
McQuade Leibowitz.
</P>
<P>
   House District 13 incumbent Republican Charles Jones of College
Station was beaten in the GOP primary by Lois Kolkhorst of Brenham.
She got 55 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Free PAC Fails _ Dallasite Richard Ford's ultra-right Free PAC
backed challengers to three Republican House members; they all won
re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Brian McCall of Plano, with 70 percent, easily stood off Kenny
Johnson of Dallas. Kim Brimer in Arlington got 55 percent against
Bill Zedler. And Dennis Bonnen of Angleton got 54 percent to again
beat Dianne Hensley of Alvin, whom he'd beaten four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   7th Congressional District _ In this GOP race to replace
retiring Republican Bill Archer in a lock Republican district,
State Rep. John Culberson, with 38 percent, led into a runoff
against businessman Peter Wareing, with 27 percent.
</P>
<P>
   President Gramm? The rumor: Ray Bowen resigns as president of
Texas A&AMP;M University over the bonfire collapse, and U.S. Sen. Phil
Gramm is named to replace him.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Bush appoints Railroad Commissioner and former Secretary of
State Tony Garza to Gramm's seat _ timed so the special election
for the remainder of the term will coincide with the general
election. This'll help Bush with Hispanics not just in Texas, but
also in California and other states.
</P>
<P>
   Only thing wrong is it's wrong, say all concerned. Bowen says he
serves at the A&AMP;M regents' pleasure, but likes his job and has no
plans to step down. Regents' chairman Don Powell of Amarillo says
he knows of no such plan.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm's spokesman Larry Neal just laughed, saying the rumor is
weeks old.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sen. Gramm loves being the senator from Texas, and the plan is
to run for re-election in 2002,'' Neal said.

 &HT;    Cruise the Web for hot travel bargains
 &HT;    By Ray Marcano
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ There are so many travel-related sites on the
Internet it's easy to get overwhelmed. There are the very popular _
and very good _ sites for just about all of your travel needs. But
there are a host of lesser-known sites that also provide terrific
bargains. Take a look at these three:
</P>
<P>
   Need a hotel? www.washingtonhotels.com is a handy site for good
hotel rates. That's where I found One Washington Circle, my
favorite D.C.-area hotel just a short walk from Georgetown. (It's
an all-suites hotel with separate living room, bedrooms and
kitchens.) The site also has links to hotels in New York, Boston
and Philadelphia and prides itself in offering rates in the
$125-a-night range _ not bad for major cities. The New York hotels,
for example, aren't midtown, but they're just a short subway ride _
or walk _ to the theater district.
</P>
<P>
   Want to take a cruise but think they're too expensive? Try
www.cruise.com, which offers many interesting cruises at $100 a day
or less. Anytime you can find a cruise at that price it's a steal,
when you consider you get food, beverages, entertainment and
lodging. Round-trip airfare should add another couple of hundred
dollars to the total. Still, there are tons of bargains (including
port fees but not airfare). Some recent examples: seven days in
Canada from New York or seven days in the Eastern Caribbean from
Fort Lauderdale for $599.
</P>
<P>
   Try www.familyfunvacations.com if you're interested in ideas for
a family vacation. You have to register but can do so without a
fee. One of the most interesting features: The site offers ideas on
driving tours for the family in all sections of the country. Many
middle-income families will bypass the resort and cruise sections
of the site, but there are a lot of interesting tidbits throughout.
Also offers special discounts and shopping trips.
</P>
<P>
   Anytime you decide to use the Internet, make sure you:
</P>
<P>
   Watch for additional fees. Internet surfing can result in huge
travel savings, but before you book, see if the service charges
additional fees. Among the possible add-ons: taxes, port charges,
airport taxes, surcharges, booking fees and mailing fees. Some
companies charge a higher change fee for airline tickets than the
airlines do. If a Web site doesn't have additional fees posted so
customers can clearly see them, call its 800 number before you
book. If there are additional fees and the company hasn't made it
easy for you to find them, complain _ loudly. Good companies
shouldn't make their customers hunt for information.
</P>
<P>
   Read the small print. Make sure you read the small print when
purchasing over the Internet. Can you change travel dates in the
event of an emergency? Can you get a full or partial refund if you
have to cancel? If you see a deal you like and aren't comfortable
booking online, then call the 800 number on the Web site and talk
to a customer-service representative.
</P>

interesting, please send a note to the address below. It could end
up in this column.

   CHONGQING, China _ The rickety, wooden gangplank, partially
submerged in mud, stretched 200 feet from the bank of the Yangtze
River to the old riverboat, Ti'an Jin.
</P>
<P>
   Trash, paper wrappers, twisted plastic and sewage floated over
the gangplank boards. The garbage is flushed 1,500 miles in fierce
currents to Shanghai and the South China Sea.
</P>
<P>
   I made a mental note not to touch the lower parts of my boots.
</P>
<P>
   Once on board, I exchanged my ticket for a card that made me an
official passenger on a dilapidated, smoke-spewing steamboat
heading downstream.
</P>
<P>
   The Yangtze is beautiful, and monstrous. It is filthy and
deadly. A quarter of a million people have died on this river this
century _ 3,000 in 1998 _ when floods consumed towns along its
banks.
</P>
<P>
   On this late afternoon, rain came down in a drizzle, but high
water seemed unlikely. I was more concerned that this metal tub
hang together until I left it.
</P>
<P>
   I was sightseeing Chinese-style deep in China's interior on a
near-mythic stream, the third-longest river in the world, flowing
3,400 miles from Tibet to the sea. But soon, the currents will be
stopped.
</P>
<P>
   When the largest dam ever built, the Three Gorges Dam, is
completed in 2009, man will have finally tamed the Yangtze. The
places I would be seeing on this trip soon will be under 500 feet
of mud and water.
</P>
<P>
   More than 150 towns, 4,000 villages, the homes of 1.5 million
people, and 4,000-year-old antiquities will be lost forever.
</P>
<P>
   The time to see the great Yangtze in its wild glory is now,
whether it's by luxury cruise liner or Chinese steamboat. I took
the low road since the luxury ships wouldn't arrive until after
March 15, when cruise season starts.
</P>
<P>
   I was the only non-Chinese person of the 100 people on board. No
one spoke English, but my room number was printed in English on my
card.
</P>
<P>
   A man grabbed my backpack and put it on one end of a bamboo pole
swung over his shoulders. I led the way to my cabin while he spit
great quantities of phlegm on the metal floor of the hallway.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, I was surprised and impressed by my first-class
room ($60 for two people, and I paid for two), which had a
sliding-glass window with a view of the river, a TV and a private
bath. A quick inspection revealed that the TV didn't work, the
window fell off its track when I tried to slide it, and there was
no heat. I could see my breath on this winter day. And the water in
the bathroom looked like what was underneath the boat.
</P>
<P>
   Stained carpet covered the metal floor, which bounced slightly
when I walked on it.
</P>
<P>
   The guy carefully put my backpack down on the narrow bunk and
gave the room its final insult _ he spit on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   No pools, Jacuzzis, bars or floor shows were featured on this
rust bucket. No midnight buffets, in fact no buffets, just a dining
room with rusty metal chairs and floors and a woman who served
plates of noodles.
</P>
<P>
   I ate in my room _ no room service, I brought my own.
</P>
<P>
   But I was here to see the Yangtze, not to see an American-style
cruise ship, and I went to sleep watching the boat's powerful
searchlights roam the riverbanks and listening to the occasional
blast of the ship's horn and announcements made in Chinese, some
lasting an hour or more. I hoped they weren't telling me where the
life jackets were.
</P>
<P>
   The boat was scheduled to stop at Fengdu at 6:30 the next
morning. Because I had such a short time in China, I planned to get
off there and book passage on another boat back to Chongqing.
</P>
<P>
   At 6 a.m. I walked down the dark hallway and found the doors at
both ends locked with bicycle chains. I was trapped like a rat
until someone got up and unlocked them. The ship was moving, so I
waited another hour and tried again.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the doors were open, and I walked to the second-,
third-, fourth- and fifth-class rooms, which had from four to 20
berths in each (some had soft cotton padding, others were rattan).
Men stood on the deck, shaving and brushing their teeth, spitting
toothpaste over the rails.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of my deck was the dining room. No breakfast buffet
here, just small metal plates of steaming noodles and peanuts.
</P>
<P>
   At about 7:30 a.m. we arrived at Fengdu, more popularly known as
Hell Town and Ghost Town. Legend says the King of Hell lives on the
side of this mountain, and numerous temples pay homage, including
the Palace of the King of Hell, Between the Living and the Dead and
Bridge of Helplessness.
</P>
<P>
   But the town was far from hellish. I bought a map from a young
woman, who followed me up the hill and into town. As I walked up
and down the narrow streets, we gathered more women, one who ate
her bowl of noodles as we walked. Soon I had a group of a dozen
women of all ages on my tour. They talked to each other and to me
in Chinese, and occasionally pointed to me and burst out laughing,
at times actually doubled over. It must have been pretty funny, so
I laughed too.
</P>
<P>
   When I got ready to leave, I showed the map lady a sentence
written in Chinese on a small piece of paper: ``Please show me to
the ticket office for the fly boats.''
</P>
<P>
   Big smile, and she marched ahead and motioned for me and my
entourage to follow.
</P>
<P>
   We filed through town, to the ticket office. My note was shown
to the ticket seller, who wrote down the price. I gave her the
money, then she gave me the ticket, which had the time in English.
</P>
<P>
   The map lady marched ahead again, leading our group back down to
the river.
</P>
<P>
   She pulled out a rattan chair in front of a shop next to the
river and motioned for me to sit down. I expected everyone to leave
as soon as I tipped the map lady, but they stayed for an hour until
the boat came, and then waved enthusiastically until I boarded.
</P>
<P>
   Fengdu _ what a cheerful, helpful and heavenly town.
</P>
<P>
   And it will soon be gone.
</P>
<P>
   Fengdu will lie at the bottom of an artificial lake that will be
400 miles long and 574 feet deep.
</P>
<P>
   The map lady and the rest of my group will be relocated to
high-rise apartment buildings being built on a hilltop in the
distance. And the King of Hell and his temples will rest in peace.
</P>
<P>
   Ecologists say the dam will be a disaster. The 1.2 mile-wide
wall will trap 3,000 miles of raw sewage and industrial waste in
the slow-moving lake. The cesspool will kill migratory fish, a
vital source of food in the valley. A series of smaller dams, they
say, would have been more effective in stopping flooding and saving
the valley.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese insist these problems have been considered, and that
the dam will provide 11 percent of China's energy, and will create
a 1,500-mile navigable waterway inland from Shanghai to Chongqing.
Locks next to the dam will allow huge ships to travel from the
coast to Chongqing.
</P>
<P>
   But those cruises will be trips of a different kind. Passengers
will see a placid lake, not a wild river that tumbles though
legendary gorges at the feet of ancient cities.

 &HT;    Beware new growth industry: Intrusion on reproductive decisions
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Adventures in big-government conservatism: Texas
courts are giving pingpong-ball treatment to a 17-year-old girl who
wants to have an abortion and who does not want to notify her
parents.
</P>
<P>
   In this, the first appeal of Texas' new parental notification
abortion law for girls 17 and under, we see the dilemmas and
inconsistencies when government presumes to interlope in
reproductive decisions.
</P>
<P>
   The first logical inconsistency is the term ``parental'' in
parental notification. By any definition, certainly in the terms of
abortion foes themselves, the ``parent'' is the pregnant female.
</P>
<P>
   Parental notification? Young lady, you're about to become one.
You are hereby notified. Under the law, a bypass can be granted
only if a local judge decides that the girl is mature enough to
make the abortion decision on her own.
</P>
<P>
   Jane Doe 3's request was denied by the trial. The Texas Supreme
Court considered the case and sent it back.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court added these factors that a trial court must
consider: the young woman's emotional and physical needs; the
possibility of danger; the stability of her home; and whether the
notification could cause lasting harm to the girl's relationship
with her parents.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the sticky business of state intervention. Bring on
the lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Was the girl being abused by her father? Is she suicidal? When
government must ratify personal decisions, we ask it to rule on
distinctions like this.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George Bush essentially has three expressed and not
entirely compatible positions on abortion: First, if it were in his
power, he'd abolish it except in cases of rape, incest and medical
necessity; second, he wouldn't change the Republican national
platform, under which a rape victim would have to bear her
attacker's child; third, he doesn't think there's sufficient
popular support to amend the Constitution, so he'd leave it alone.
</P>
<P>
   One can understand why Bush will peddle Option No. 3 as he tries
to get back to the center on this issue.
</P>
<P>
   It would be fascinating to see a constitutional amendment that
not only gave 14th Amendment rights to a fetus but made exceptions,
as Bush would, for a fetus resulting from rape or incest, or whose
mother might not survive childbirth.
</P>
<P>
   That would result in a constitutional amendment just about as
long as the Roe vs. Wade decision, which is longer than the U.S.
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine the court cases. A pregnant woman says she was raped.
Raped? Did you press charges? Can you provide physical evidence?
Can you produce the rapist?
</P>
<P>
   Too rarely do we hear conservatives, who are said to mistrust
government, saying government should stay out of matters like this,
matters between a physician and a patient. The hypocrisy is
deafening.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of parental consent/notification laws and the issue of
``partial-birth abortion'' are seen as slam-dunk opportunities for
abortion foes.
</P>
<P>
   But in fact, both issues reflect the excruciating dilemmas that
come with government intrusion into private medical decisions. In
the case of partial-birth abortion, we are to assume that
government can make the call when a doctor fears that a woman might
lose her life or her ability to conceive, or when the fetus simply
is unable to survive outside the womb.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of parental consent/notification, we want government
to determine if a girl has a valid fear of involving her parents,
or if she's sufficiently mature. Define ``mature.''
</P>
<P>
   It seems Jane Doe 3, the real parent in the equation, meets the
definition of mature simply by taking her decision to court. But to
Texas she's just a pingpong ball.

 &HT;    Primping for prom
 &HT;    By Meredith Moss
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ It's a unique shopping experience _ fun, exciting
and filled with promise.
</P>
<P>
   Make that promise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every girl wants to look pretty, dolled up and a little extra
special,'' says Bree Gelber, accessories editor for Seventeen
magazine. ``You're looking for that perfect dress, for perfect
shoes. Though it's not true for everyone, most girls want to look
different than they usually do.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the case for Tiffany Collins, a junior at Stebbins High
school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm usually in a T-shirt and jeans,'' says the 16-year-old
soccer player. ``For prom, I want something fancy, different,
new.''
</P>
<P>
   Centerville High School senior Rachel Carlson says the prom,
especially your senior prom, is a huge event. Though she and her
friends sometimes borrow one another's dresses, they typically get
a new dress for each big dance.
</P>
<P>
   As a member of Elder-Beerman's Junior Advisory Board, Rachel
regularly gets a chance to try on the season's hottest looks before
they hit the stores. The board's job is to provide feedback to
buyers.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, the group donned sample prom dresses. Rachel
says the big news was the gorgeous colors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a blast!'' she says. ``I love the pastels, and pink and
purple are really hot.''
</P>
<P>
   Seventeen's Gelber confirms this season's wide range of colors.
``We've seen a ton of pinks ... from baby pink to fichia, from
light peach to a more vibrant peach. And all shades of purple.''
</P>
<P>
   Parents will be delighted because what's fashionable is also
pretty and feminine.
</P>
<P>
   Miami Valley department stores and specialty shops are filling
up with beautiful hues and delicate fabrics: satins, tulle
overlays, eyelet, with delicate embroidery or simple beading.
</P>
<P>
   Spaghetti straps are popular, as are strapless gowns, often with
matching wraps. Both long and short lengths will be seen on the
dance floor this year, with skirts ranging from very full ballgowns
to body-skimming sheaths.
</P>
<P>
   It's not surprising that separates _ popular for brides and
bridesmaids _ have reached the prom market as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two-piece dresses are really in style this season,'' says
Rachel, who also loved the backless dresses ``that flow at the
bottom.'' Another favorite is the corset top looks.
</P>
<P>
   One of the newer shapes is a handkerchief top with halter back.
Those who seek something different may opt for silky prints with
scarf hemlines or embroidered skirts with tube tops. Vintage looks
are unique and can save dollars as well.
</P>
<P>
   Prices range from less than $100 to $450. You'll pay less for
rentals.
</P>
<P>
   ``They only want to wear the dress once, so renting makes
sense,'' says Tiffany's mom, Donna Collins. ``And that way she can
get a very beautiful gown.''
</P>
<P>
   Prom also provides a wonderful opportunity to show off pretty
accessories.
</P>
<P>
   This season's little handbags are decorated with sequins,
patchwork, beading or fringe. A decorative purse is a perfect
complement to a simple gown.
</P>
<P>
   Other accessories for Prom 2000 include crocheted shawls,
colorful strappy sandals, ribbon necklaces and bracelets. You'll
see lots of dangly earrings. Chunky rings are in demand as well.
</P>
<P>
   Hair accessories include pins and headbands with sparkle, as
well as pretty tiaras. You can also put a fabric flower or even
real flowers in your hair. Accessories also are the big story for
the guys.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vests with matching bow ties are popular,'' says Edd Wimsatt,
owner of Price Stores. ``Young men really like a vest.''
</P>
<P>
   Other popular looks include button covers instead of bow ties,
worn with a mandarin-style tux shirt, and the Euro-tie _ which
looks like a traditional four-in-hand tie and can be worn with
either a wing-collar or Euro-wing collar shirt.
</P>
<P>
   You'll see piping on the tux coat this season, plus notch, shawl
and peak lapels. A tux from Fubu features a jacket with inside cell
phone and CD pocket. Trendy shoes include black patent with box or
cap toes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys go out and hunt for the hottest GQ looks,'' says
Jason Bayus, a Fairmont High School senior. ``Shopping is a lot
easier for us than for women.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Cathy Ramby of Skeffington's, longer jackets also
are popular.
</P>
<P>
   Students from five Miami Valley schools will model prom fashions
at an upcoming fund-raiser, called ``Style Promenade.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These kids are trying to do something to help other kids stay
safe for prom this year,'' says Gerda Bray of L'Affair, one of the
event sponsors. Proceeds will benefit the Students Against
Destructive Decisions chapters at each of the participating
schools.
</P>
<P>
   The prom shopping experience can also be a time for bonding _
for friends and families.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been our time together,'' says Donna Collins. ``We've
had fun _ a lot of chuckles. It's especially important when I think
that a year from now, she'll be heading off to school.''

 &HT;    Picking the right look for prom
 &HT;    By Meredith Moss
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _
</P>
<P>
   SHOPPING TIPS
</P>
<P>
   _ Browse through magazines and tear out pages with gowns,
tuxedos or accessories you like. Bring them along when you shop.
</P>
<P>
   _ Consider shopping first with friends and narrowing your
selection. Then bring a parent back for the final decision.
</P>
<P>
   _ Take along a pair of shoes that are about the same height as
the pair you'll wear to the dance.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't forget the underpinnings you'll need for a specific
dress when you're estimating cost. Some dresses require a strapless
or low-back bra; close-to-the-body dresses may require lingerie
that disappears. Don't wait until the last minute to buy it.
</P>
<P>
   _ Keep an open mind. Don't rule any style out until you've tried
it on. You may be surprised at what looks great.
</P>
<P>
   _ Leave price tags on dresses if you're unsure about keeping
them. They cannot be returned or exchanged if tags have been
removed.
</P>
<P>
   _ Consider renting a dress. Also think about thrift, consignment
or vintage shops. Or borrow a gown from a friend or sister.
</P>
<P>
   _ Try on lots of accessories; they can make the outfit. When
it's time for makeup, play up your eyes or lips, but not both.

 &HT;    Pretty woman takes on polluting bad guys
 &HT;    By Gary Schwan
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Producers were worried about the title,
especially a name so spectacularly ethnic as ``Erin Brockovich.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, they could have called the movie ``Julia Roberts, Julia
Roberts.'' The actress is the film, which is a true story about an
average Jo who mounts a legal battle against a utility company
responsible for poisoning the waters of a California town.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts is rarely off-screen, and it's not exactly painful to
study her milelong legs and canyon-esque cleavage for more than two
hours. She dresses like a call girl and talks like a drill
sergeant. This only underscores the fairy-tale quality of the story
_ a blue-collar Sleeping Beauty awakens from a life of drudgery to
be all that she can be.
</P>
<P>
   Still, too bad the tale is a pastiche of any number of
crusader/underdog movies, from ``Norma Rae'' to ``A Civil Action.''
There is even a whiff of ``Working Girl.'' Brockovich is a nobody
who proves more resourceful than the fancy-pants professionals
around her.
</P>
<P>
   The film is lightened with a good deal of humor. Roberts'
profanity-laced put-downs make you wince but can be funny. And her
portrayal of a frazzled working mother is often touching. Her
domestic trials are the best part of the movie, since the legal
machinations surrounding the pollution case aren't terribly
dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   Brockovich is a twice-divorced mother of three down on her luck.
Although aggressive, even abusive at times, she's the perfect
madonna when it comes to her children.
</P>
<P>
   Desperate for a job, she bullies her way into the office of an
attorney played by an amusing Albert Finney. Looking into a rash of
medical problems in a rural town, she discovers that a utility
company is ducking responsibility for having contaminated the water
years before.
</P>
<P>
   She persuades her reluctant boss (Finney) _ and equally
skeptical townsfolk _ to pursue the case. Although she has no
formal education, she does most of the investigative work,
compiling a mound of evidence at the risk of neglecting her family
and alienating a love interest, a good-hearted biker named George
(Aaron Eckhart).
</P>
<P>
   There are a few courtroom scenes, but no dramatic
confrontations. In large part, ``Erin Brockovich'' is a ``female
empowerment'' movie, the story of a feisty woman who reinvents
herself against the odds.
</P>
<P>
   Save for one bedroom frolic, Steve Soderbergh (``Out of Sight'')
directs the film in a straightforward manner, not forgetting to get
plenty of close-ups on Roberts' intriguing face.
</P>
<P>
   The actress rounds all the bases _ from trademark cuteness, to
comedy, to romantic tenderness and dramatic intensity. It's perhaps
the best performance of her career, and certainly the most complex.
</P>
<P>
   Finney is a comic foil _ a gruff teddy bear who is frequently
exasperated by Roberts' brashness and crudity. Eckhart is engaging
as a tattooed biker who happens to make a great house-daddy. And
Marg Helgenberger is touching as a housewife crushed and bewildered
by her medical problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Erin Brockovich'' works well as a sophisticated soap opera,
and Roberts has never been better. But here's wishing the legal
drama was more complicated and compelling.

 &HT;    `Algernon' ideal - brilliance -
 &HT;    is author's, too
 &HT;    By Chris Hutchins
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Meet Charlie Gordon. He is 37 years old.
He is mentally retarded.
</P>
<P>
   He wants to be smart. He really does.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie is about to have an ``operashun.'' The procedure, he
hopes, will make him smart.
</P>
<P>
   The procedure, in fact, will cause his IQ of 68 to triple.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Charlie will make an entry in his Progress Report:
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what to think about,'' he'll write. ``Maybe if I
ask (the doctor) he will tell me how I can think now that Im
suppose to get smart. What do smart people think about. Fancy
things I suppose. I wish I knew some fancy things already.''
</P>
<P>
   Now meet Daniel Keyes.
</P>
<P>
   More than 40 years ago, Keyes created Charlie in the
award-winning novelette ``Flowers For Algernon,'' a fictional
chronicle of the first human to become ``smarter'' by experimental
surgery. In the story, Charlie befriends a mouse named Algernon,
who has also received the surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Keyes fleshed out the character in a novel of the same name in
1966.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you write something, you essentially throw a stone in the
water, and watch the ripples spread,'' the writer said during a
recent chat at Boca Raton's Boca Teeca Inn. ```Flowers' has
affected more people than I can imagine. I know the story will
outlive me.''
</P>
<P>
   Believe him. The novel, now in its 89th printing, has sold more
than 6 million copies worldwide. It is used in schools across the
country. It's generated thousands of letters to the author. And two
movies. And a stage musical. And a theatrical production in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   It also prompted Keyes, who has lived in Boca Raton for the past
eight years, to write a memoir about writing ``Flowers.'' In
``Algernon, Charlie and I: A Writer's Journey,'' Keyes chronicles
his own growth. He writes about his childhood in Brooklyn; about
editing pulp magazines and comic books to make ends meet; about
teaching high school in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   Keyes also introduces readers to the real-life inspiration for
Charlie Gordon: a boy he was teaching in a class for slow students.
One day after class, the boy said something that changed the
writer's life.
</P>
<P>
   I want to be smart.
</P>
<P>
   Keyes never forgot that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hit me in the gut,'' he says. ``I suddenly saw _ through
his eyes _ something I hadn't been aware of: A slow learner, a
retarded person, wants to be smart. It never occurred to me before.
As people, we tend to walk by people who are handicapped and don't
get involved with them. Well, teaching these kids, you had to get
involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Keyes connected with that boy, and ``Flowers For Algernon'' came
soon after that. Readers have since connected with Charlie. Since
1959, they've connected with his dreams ... and his desperation
when Algernon dies, and his own intelligence begins to revert.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see, I'm Charlie,'' Keyes explains. ``My hopes, my
aspirations, my fears: I just gave them to the character. But I get
letters and e-mail from children and students from all over the
world. They say the same thing: `I'm Charlie.' Somehow, in plumbing
my own depths, I touched some universal thing that all of us
share.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People always ask, `How do you write? What are your
methods?''' Keyes says. ``I wanted to leave behind how I did this
story, and show how my life was involved in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was something I had to get out of me,'' he says. ``It was
something I thought would be useful to others.''

 &HT;    Pipher bridges the gap between generations
 &HT;    BY Mae Woods Bell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCKY MOUNT, N.C. _ ``Another Country'' by Mary Pipher;
Riverhead; 325 pages; $13.95
</P>
<P>
   In this work, subtitled ``Navigating the Emotional Terrain of
our Elders,'' Pipher takes readers inside the minds, hearts and
bodies of older men and women. She does it with insight, humor,
sensitivity and an affinity for relying on common sense rather than
psycho-
</P>
<P>
   babble.
</P>
<P>
   With the dawn of the new millen-
</P>
<P>
   nium, we are entering new territory, with different family
structures, work options, kinds of old age and choices about living
situations and health care. Families are struggling with all the
old problems of aging relatives and the new dilemmas presented by
today's rapidly changing world. Drawing on her 20 years as a
therapist and from interviews with families and older individuals,
Pipher shares the stories of real people as she maps out the
territory that distinguishes the elderly from subsequent
generations. Above all, she offers scenarios _ from
intergenerational church dinners to elementary school field trips
to rest homes _ that bridge the generation gap.
</P>
<P>
   She explores significant issues faced by millions of baby
boomers as their parents and grandparents age. Among the chapters
in this revealing and inspirational look at the often foreign
landscape of old age, are:
</P>
<P>
   _ Time Zones _ An analysis of cultural changes that have
occurred since the early part of the century. These include the
country's shift from a communal to an individualistic society,
changes in values, alterations in sexual roles and attitudes, and a
transformation in the meaning of dependency from a natural to a
shameful condition. Pipher calls intergenerational
misunderstandings ``time-zone problems ... Only by understanding
what things mean to people in other time-zones can we truly
communicate with them.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The Great Divide _ A look at how psychology became the great
divide between the generation of our elders and subsequent
generations. It isn't difficult to grasp the technological changes
that earlier generations have experienced; what is hard to
comprehend is the pre-Freudian way in which many elders process
reality.
</P>
<P>
   _ Let a Thousand Old Flowers Bloom _ A reflection on resilience
in the face of adversity. ``The resilient old,'' Pipher says,
``have learned about psychological survival from their long and
complicated lives. They carry on in spite of losses. They tend to
be practical, sensible and well organized. All have interests and
relationships that sustain them ... As much is taken away, that
which remains grows more precious.'' In discussing the needs of the
resilient old, Pipher refers to her ``Five R's'' _ respect,
relationships, results, relaxation and realization.
</P>
<P>
   _ We Grow Souls Together _ A view of the special relationship
that exists between grandparents and grandchildren. She examines
the shift in roles played by parents as their children have
children of their own; the connections between old and young; the
ways in which grandparents pass along wisdom and moral values; and
the ways in which grandparents serve as the connecting tissue
between generations.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Pipher received her bachelor's of arts degree in cultural
anthropology from the University of California at Berkeley, and her
doctorate in clinical psychology from the University of Nebraska,
where she is a visiting assistant professor. She is also a
commentator for Nebraska Public Radio, and contributing editor to
USA Weekend. She is the author of a groundbreaking 1994 best seller
about adolescent girls, ``Reviving Ophelia'' and another
bestseller, ``The Shelter of Each Other'' (1996). She lives in
Lincoln, Neb.

 &HT;    On his terms, endearing or not
 &HT;    By Scott Eyman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ For nearly 30 years, the routine was
unvarying. For a month in the spring and a month in the fall,
Graham Greene would come to Capri, to a small house he bought in
1948.
</P>
<P>
   He would do his daily ration of 350 words, eat at his favorite
restaurants, spend time with a few well-chosen friends _ often his
mistress of this period, the American Catherine Walston, who was
succeeded by Yvonne Cloetta.
</P>
<P>
   Shirley Hazzard, the wife of biographer Francis Steegmuller and
a very good novelist in her own right, offers a fragrant, funny,
precise picture of a writer whose considerable worldly success
never tempted him into untoward displays of optimism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Point me out a happy man,'' Greene once snapped, ``and I will
point you out either egotism, selfishness, evil _ or else an
absolute ignorance.''
</P>
<P>
   Greene, of course, thrived on his internal contradictions; they
were the basis for his art. A renegade Catholic, his first moves
when visiting any town for the first time were to investigate the
local Catholic churches, followed immediately by the local houses
of prostitution.
</P>
<P>
   Married only once, he had several long-term mistresses, each
relationship earning the de facto support of the ladies' compliant
husbands.
</P>
<P>
   His was a character of Dickensian richness. Personally rather
cheap _ he hated the expense of taxis and avoided them whenever he
could, while the price of heating oil received regular arias of
displeasure _ he nevertheless had a habit of financially supporting
writers he respected who were having trouble earning a living wage
from their work.
</P>
<P>
   (Most prominently, Muriel Spark was the recipient of Greene's
largesse for a long time, the monthly checks often accompanied by
some bottles of wine, to take the edge off the charity.)
</P>
<P>
   He had a temper and could fall into contrary moods, when he
sought to provoke a fight. At such times, writes Hazzard, he looked
for all the world, ``like Thomas Mitchell playing Scarlett's
demented father.''
</P>
<P>
   He liked Ralph Richardson and Paul Scofield, abhorred Olivier.
Henry James was a lifelong enthusiasm, until the very end of his
life, when he suddenly found to his chagrin that James had become
unreadable.
</P>
<P>
   He adored practical jokes, as long as he was doing the joking
and someone else was doing the practicing. As is obvious from his
fiction, where Americans are invariably portrayed as rambunctious,
none-too-bright children given to carelessly sprinting through the
sitting rooms of Europe and breaking all the carefully preserved
china, he disliked us but was willing to make exceptions for
certain individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Like every successful writer, he had a strong work ethic and put
in his time at the writing table every day, not just when he felt
like it. He made no particular claims for his later work, and
Hazzard makes some severe criticisms of his books: ``Poignancy was
largely subsumed into world-weariness, resurfacing in spasms of
authenticity ... sheer human sympathy makes an obligatory guest
appearance, like an aging celebrity briefly brought on stage.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a book coming out,'' he might say. ``Not a specially
good one.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Evelyn Waugh, he liked things to go wrong, but only on his
terms. He exhibited nearly all human qualities except tenderness,
``that is, there was no self-forgetful surrender _ whether to
affection or to the vulnerable shades of trust or remorse; still
less to any enduring state of happiness.''
</P>
<P>
   Hazzard writes very evocatively, with affection but a clear
sense of Greene's essentially chauvinist views and of his
unharmonious nature. There is also much delicious detail of the
island of Capri itself _ 4 miles long, about 5 1/2 miles of
territory in all.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, there is sometimes a bit too much delicious detail, as
the background threatens to overwhelm the character in the
foreground, who was, after all, some kind of great writer.
</P>
<P>
   But this is a small, forgivable fault in a lovely little book
that deserves the attention of anybody who's ever been moved by the
cold anguish of ``The Power and the Glory,'' ``The End of the
Affair'' or ``The Human Factor.''

 &HT;    Bookstores becoming home for more than buying
 &HT;    By Laura Dempsey
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ It must be the coffee.
</P>
<P>
   At Half Price Books in Dayton, the brew is free all day, and
patrons partake as they browse, standing in the aisles, sitting on
stools or cross-legged on the floor for as long as it takes to get
a satisfactory fix of caffeine, words and pictures, be it a few
minutes, an hour, an afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``One guy comes here for five or six hours at a time and
reads,'' said store manager Melanie Adams, who thinks he may have
bought a book once, but she can't really remember. Not that it
matters. ``We don't discourage him at all.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Daryl Ward, pastor at Dayton's Omega Baptist Church,
often can be found in a comfortable chair at Borders Books &AMP; Music,
or Barnes &AMP; Noble _ he likes to move around a bit, ``because I come
a couple of times a week.''
</P>
<P>
   Ensconsed with his Bible and a silver Starbucks travel mug full
of bookstore blend, Ward works on his sermons, thinks, reads and
watches people.
</P>
<P>
   In the big stores, it's obvious people are doing more than
buying books. They're standing around, reading, talking, sitting,
napping, drinking coffee, eating cookies, meeting friends.
Bookstores have become much more than places to spend money:
They've become places to spend the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love being surrounded by books, but libraries are too
sanitary,'' Ward laughed, ``I like to drink coffee. I like for
something to be going on around me. I can buy books, browse, study,
and they're open late.''
</P>
<P>
   Kettering's renowned Books &AMP; Co. was onto something big when it
opened, in a decidedly tiny nook in the Town &AMP; Country Shopping
Center, with a decided aversion to many stores' ``don't-browse,
buy'' policy. It made itself an inviting destination for window
shoppers with tactile tendencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like that from the very beginning,'' said Sharon Kelly
Roth, director of public relations for the store. ``Anything we
could do to encourage reading. ... We would never hurry people
out.''
</P>
<P>
   In July 1990, Books &AMP; Co. moved into an expanded space. Part of
the floor plan was reserved for a cafe, to be run by Harriet and
George Argue, owners of Truffles. At the end of 1990, the Argues
opened their second Truffles in the Books &AMP; Co. space, operating as
a separate entity, yet connected to the bookstore so customers
could wander freely from one to the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was strictly in response to customers' requests,'' said
Roth. ``One woman asked if we could just put a pot of coffee on ...
she said, `I like to come all day, and I just get weak!'
</P>
<P>
   Books &AMP; Co. may not have known it then, but it was on the
cutting edge of a trend toward eating and reading, all in the same
place. A day could be spent without leaving the bookstore.
</P>
<P>
   For Borders as well, customers gave them no choice. The chain
started small in 1971, when two brothers opened a used bookstore in
Ann Arbor, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1973 they moved, and started carrying new books,'' said Ann
Binkley, public relations manager. ``They were right in the middle
of the University of Michigan, and you find that with students,
they come in and hang out. They really enjoyed the store.''
</P>
<P>
   As the company started to grow and more locations opened,
Binkley said Borders ``wanted to keep that atmosphere, where people
were comfortable. We want to make the stores very inviting _ we
encourage browsing. That has been our philosophy all along.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until 1991, though, that Borders opened a store with
attached cafe, in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our stores had started to grow, and they were places where
people stayed for a few hours. We wanted to enhance their
experience by adding the cafe, so if they're thirsty or hungry, we
allow them to pick up a book or grab a magazine,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   It works, for folks such as David Kang, a 28-year-old medical
student from Cincinnati, who typically spends afternoons at one
bookstore or another, textbooks and highlighters spread out and,
usually, earphones in place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Libraries are a sort of sensory deprivation,'' he said one
weekday afternoon at the Borders near the Dayton Mall. ``They're
just too quiet for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Kang has been studying in bookstores ``pretty much since
college,'' at the University of Chicago. ``I can study, drink
coffee, then get up and walk around. I look at a lot of magazines
here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bookstore studying, Kang believes, ``is kind of hip, it's cool.
It's stimulating, believe it or not, and encourages you to study.
At a library, I just kind of float off.''
</P>
<P>
   For Jennifer Saunders, 29, Borders is a near-mandatory daily
stop before she starts work at nearby Lexis Nexis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here two, three times a week,'' she said. ``I'll get a
thing of coffee, maybe a scone,'' before settling in for an hour or
so of reading before her shift, which starts at 1:30 p.m.
``Sometimes, I come just to look around.''
</P>
<P>
   Saunders loves Borders' music section, where she can try things
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``On Friday nights, sometimes I'll meet friends here and we'll
sit and talk,'' she said. ``I have never been asked if I am going
to buy anything or if I need anything else. The atmosphere is just
good, relaxed. The staff is really friendly.''
</P>
<P>
   At Barnes &AMP; Noble's two area stores _ across from the Dayton
Mall on Miamisburg-Centerville Road and near the Mall at Fairfield
Commons on North Fairfield Road _ students seem to be the norm at
the cafe tables.
</P>
<P>
   Shalini Aggarwal, 26, and her fiance Jon Ryan, 29, are studying
for their medical boards. Both attend Des Moines University, and
were in town visiting Aggarwal's family. But medical school doesn't
believe in vacations, so their afternoon was spent at the
bookstore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I come for the coffee,'' said Aggarwal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good break from the isolation of the library,'' said
Ryan. ``Bookstores are becoming more popular places to study.''
</P>
<P>
   He understands why the stores encourage folks like them: ``It
makes loyal customers. We do browse, and we do buy.''
</P>
<P>
   Kendra Steele had trekked through town, from her Harrison Twp.
home to Miami Twp.'s Barnes &AMP; Noble, with her three boys, in search
of a copy of ``Fahrenheit 451'' for 16-year-old Gregory's high
school English class.
</P>
<P>
   She couldn't resist checking out a few titles herself, and soon
the family, including Christopher, 12, and Edward, 13, had taken
over one of B&AMP;N's classic crannies. Gregory started in on
Bradbury's classic while Kendra flipped through several books
before returning all but one to the shelf. She returned to the big,
soft chair and began reading.
</P>
<P>
   ``You sit in these chairs and it is so comfortable,'' she said.
``As soon as I finish my chi (sweet tea and milk), we'll head on
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had one of these big chairs in my room, I might never
leave.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, a nameless patron dozed in a similar chair, a copy of
``Porting UNIX Software'' face down on the table next to a
near-empty cup of coffee _ proof that there are some things even
caffeine can't combat.

 &HT;    Tolkien and his `Lord' are still ringing up sales
 &HT;    By Scott Eyman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ J.R.R. Tolkien became famous in the
'60s, mostly because he didn't become famous in the '50s, when he
originally published his ``Lord of the Rings'' trilogy.
</P>
<P>
   The true measure of his accomplishment came in the '70s with a
relentless series of imitations that show no signs of letting up.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, writers such as Terry Brooks, Stephen Donaldson,
David Eddings and Robert Jordan would never have had their careers
without Tolkien's example.
</P>
<P>
   Houghton Mifflin has virtually every scrap of paper the Oxford
don ever scribbled in print, but they just released a volume called
``The Father Christmas Letters,'' an entertaining, nicely
illustrated group of letters that Tolkien wrote to his children as
an annual holiday ritual.
</P>
<P>
   Now that a two-part film adaptation of the ``Rings'' trilogy is
under way in New Zealand, directed by Peter Jackson, look for the
drumbeats to continue as the film's release draws closer.
</P>
<P>
   IN THE TRADE ...
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Nelson, heretofore a religious publisher, has bought
Rutledge Hill, a small publisher with an emphasis on Southern
history and cooking. Rutledge's most successful books have been
titles like ``Aunt Bee's Mayberry Cookbook'' and ``Life's Little
Instruction Book.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson plans to use the Rutledge imprint as a vehicle for
nonreligious books, with about 35 titles issued annually.
</P>
<P>
   FORE! ...
</P>
<P>
   Payne Stewart, who died in a mysterious plane crash last fall,
is the subject of two competing biographies scheduled for midyear
release. One, for Andrews and McMeel, is by veteran Florida
sportswriter Larry Guest; the other, by Stewart's widow, Tracey,
and writer Ken Abraham, is for Broadman &AMP; Holman in Nashville,
Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   Another interesting project in the works is a large-scale
biography of Norman Rockwell by Laura Claridge, which Random House
will publish in time for the 2001 opening of a major Rockwell
exhibit at the Guggenheim.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the millions upon millions of non-fans who avoided the
recent Andy Kaufman biopic ``Man on the Moon'' will also have a
chance to avoid yet another book about him. Julie Hecht has been
signed to write a book entitled ``Was This Man a Genius?'' for
Random House.
</P>
<P>
   I haven't read the book, but I can answer the question with some
degree of certainty.
</P>
<P>
   QUOTE UNQUOTE ...
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a story about the Founding Fathers and oral sex, and I
confess to a great interest in both.''

 &HT;    Agnes is no Angela: Irish poverty played for laughs
 &HT;    By Hap Erstein
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ ``Agnes Browne'' is an entertaining
slice of blarney that has arrived in time for St. Patrick's Day.
Agnes is a newly widowed Dubliner, trying to raise her brood of
seven despite a life of unrelenting hardship. The movie is
alternately touching, comic and preposterous, but even when it
loses touch with reality, it is never less than watchable, thanks
to an earthy earth mother title performance by Angelica Huston.
</P>
<P>
   Based on co-screenwriter Brendan O'Carroll's novel ``The
Mammy,'' which has its roots in a popular Irish radio serial,
``Agnes Browne'' will never be mistaken for ``Angela's Ashes.''
Terrible things happen to Agnes and her family, but the movie _
directed by Huston with insufficient grit _ never leaves any doubt
that the Widow Browne will triumph over adversity.
</P>
<P>
   The script has a winking fable quality from its first moments,
when Agnes applies to receive her late husband's pension. She is
refused for lack of a death certificate that she does not have, she
explains, because the bloke died that morning.
</P>
<P>
   So Agnes is forced to borrow from a street-corner loan shark, a
cardboard villain she will anger by paying off the loan early. The
funeral is played for laughs, when the hearse overheats, backfires
and breaks down on the way to the cemetery. At the grave, Agnes
becomes livid when she spies a mysterious attractive woman and
decides she was her husband's mistress, only to realize they are
standing at the wrong burial site.
</P>
<P>
   The best part of the movie is Agnes' interaction with her best
friend, Marion (Marion O'Dwyer in an attention-getting screen
debut), also a produce-market clerk. Agnes listens with wide-eyed
fascination as Marion tells her of her wondrous sexual climaxes _
her so-called ``organisms'' _ which Agnes never experienced in her
entire baby-making career.
</P>
<P>
   If that weren't bad enough, once the women form an enduring bond
of friendship, Marion develops breast cancer. In a touch of
situation comic-tragedy, Marion indulges her dream to learn to
drive, though she does not own a car. During a lesson she and Agnes
erupt in a giggle fit, followed by a sobering reversal.
</P>
<P>
   Realizing one's dreams is a recurring theme, and Agnes harbors a
desire to see hip-swiveling Tom Jones, who is coming to Dublin for
a concert. But she accepts forlornly that feeding her family takes
priority over fulfilling her fantasy. Unfortunately, O'Carroll has
a far more romantic notion involving a cameo by Jones that feels
like one of those guest-starring shots on ``The Lucille Ball
Show.''
</P>
<P>
   In taking her place in the director's chair, Huston follows the
tradition of her father, John. It is an assured, if unexceptional,
job of filmmaking, but perhaps it will lead to more ambitious
projects down the road. It is most distinguished in the performance
she draws from herself, a noble but affecting portrait of a woman
burdened by life, but able to laugh at her plight.
</P>
<P>
   She handles the loan shark, accepts a date from a sensitive
French baker and teaches her kids about survival, all neatly
subdivided into radio show episodes. There are plenty of reasons to
nit-pick this only-in-the-movies view of poverty, or you could step
back, accept its flaws and still enjoy spending time with the
unsinkable ``Agnes Browne.''

   TRAVEL-GULFCOASTLINE _ WALTON COUNTY, Fla. _ The first thing I
notice when I turn off U.S. 98 onto Scenic 30-A, a meandering,
20-mile asphalt ribbon that flirts with south Walton County's Gulf
coastline, is what I don't notice. Unlike Panama City and Destin,
which lie about 30 minutes to the east and west, respectively,
there are no crowded streets filled with towering condos. No tacky
surfside stores hawking airbrushed T-shirts or, um, water pipes.
Not even a set of golden arches to cast its cool shadow across the
shimmering waters of this old-fashioned Florida oasis. The sleepy,
surfside communities along Scenic 30-A shun these brash,
commercialized come-ons. Instead, they allow the twists and turns
of the road to reveal their charms in tantalizing glimpses.

   GULFCOAST-TOUR _ WALTON COUNTY, Fla. _ Part of south Walton
County's appeal are the diverse choices it presents visitors. You
can dine on filet mignon served up on fine china, or feast on deep
fried shrimp and hush puppies dished out in red plastic baskets.
There are swanky boutiques you can stalk in strappy heels, funky
folk art galleries for the Birkenstock-clad, and miles of beachside
dunes, lakes and bayous best explored in a pair of disposable
flip-flops. Whether you're a Phipps Plaza patron, a
Poncey-Highlands urban pioneer, or a suburban Jimmy Buffet wannabe,
Scenic 30-A is your scene. (This story details the three different
faces of 30-A, how it's a nice fit for three different types of
tourists.) (Laughinghouse, Atlanta Journal-Constitution freelancer;

   IMAC-MCDONALDS _ COSTA RICA _ From the outside, it looks like
any other McDonald's, golden arches and all, plucked out of middle
America and plunked down in Central America. But on the inside,
this McDonald's (near San Jose, Costa Rica) has a some slightly
different combination meals. In addition to Big Macs, it has iMac
computers. And if you buy a combo meal and supersize those papas

Think Copacabana, Mandy, I Write the Songs and all his other hit

still synonymous with the schlock pop of the '70s, the

   TRAVEL-GULFCOASTLINE _ WALTON COUNTY, Fla. _ The first thing I
notice when I turn off U.S. 98 onto Scenic 30-A, a meandering,
20-mile asphalt ribbon that flirts with south Walton County's Gulf
coastline, is what I don't notice. Unlike Panama City and Destin,
which lie about 30 minutes to the east and west, respectively,
there are no crowded streets filled with towering condos. No tacky
surfside stores hawking airbrushed T-shirts or, um, water pipes.
Not even a set of golden arches to cast its cool shadow across the
shimmering waters of this old-fashioned Florida oasis. The sleepy,
surfside communities along Scenic 30-A shun these brash,
commercialized come-ons. Instead, they allow the twists and turns
of the road to reveal their charms in tantalizing glimpses.

   GULFCOAST-TOUR _ WALTON COUNTY, Fla. _ Part of south Walton
County's appeal are the diverse choices it presents visitors. You
can dine on filet mignon served up on fine china, or feast on deep
fried shrimp and hush puppies dished out in red plastic baskets.
There are swanky boutiques you can stalk in strappy heels, funky
folk art galleries for the Birkenstock-clad, and miles of beachside
dunes, lakes and bayous best explored in a pair of disposable
flip-flops. Whether you're a Phipps Plaza patron, a
Poncey-Highlands urban pioneer, or a suburban Jimmy Buffet wannabe,
Scenic 30-A is your scene. (This story details the three different
faces of 30-A, how it's a nice fit for three different types of
tourists.) (Laughinghouse, Atlanta Journal-Constitution freelancer;

   IMAC-MCDONALDS _ COSTA RICA _ From the outside, it looks like
any other McDonald's, golden arches and all, plucked out of middle
America and plunked down in Central America. But on the inside,
this McDonald's (near San Jose, Costa Rica) has a some slightly
different combination meals. In addition to Big Macs, it has iMac
computers. And if you buy a combo meal and supersize those papas
fritas, you get 30 minutes of Internet access. (Martz, Atlanta

Think Copacabana, Mandy, I Write the Songs and all his other hit

still synonymous with the schlock pop of the '70s, the

Manilow Sings Sinatra, released in 1998, earned him critical kudos

Here are Anne Stephenson's capsule reviews of new books:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``AFTERBURN'' &QL; 
 &UR; By Colin Harrison (FSG, $25) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The thing about thrillers is that so many of them are bad.
Abysmal, even. It's a genre so plagued by hack writers and
bush-league prose that when you find one like this, you want to
call it by another name. But a thriller it is _ the long, patient
kind, with underplayed dialogue and characters who sidestep
stereotype every time it shows up to claim them. The protagonist is
Charlie Ravich, a former Vietnam fighter pilot and POW now in his
late 50s who faces crisis in his private life and in his
multimillion-dollar corporate affairs. Harrison spends much of his
book establishing a thin connection between Charlie and a young
woman named Christina Welles, who has just been released from
prison and who, with her former boyfriend, is suspected of stealing
from a mobster who really, REALLY, wants his money back. There's
sex. There's violence (we don't want to spoil your fun if you have
a taste for it, but for the sake of the squeamish, we'll mention a
little torture scene involving an electric drill and a circular saw
_ and that's not the last of it). If you can take the gore, this
book is enough to give a weak genre a good name. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ``CINEMA SOUTHWEST'' &QL; 
 &UR; By John A. Murray (Northland, $21.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The photo on the cover is of John Ford making a scene from ``The
Searchers'' in 1956, but that's just the predictable side of
filmmaking in the American Southwest. Think of the alternatives. In
1965, Max Von Sydow, as Jesus, delivered the Sermon on the Mount on
Utah's Green River Overlook in ``The Greatest Story Ever Told.''
Dennis Hopper and Peter Fonda camped in Anasazi ruins on their way
east in ``Easy Rider.'' Robert Duvall turned his life around on the
Texas prairie in ``Tender Mercies,'' and in ``Bonnie and Clyde,''
Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway robbed an actual bank in the rural
community of Pilot Point, Texas _ the same bank that the real
Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow had robbed about 40 years earlier.
In this book, due out at the end of the month, Murray looks at the
Southwest and its starring role in so many American films. Included
are some great photographs _ our favorite, we confess, is of John
Wayne (in ``She Wore a Yellow Ribbon'') looking grandly out at that
mist-shrouded Big Daddy of film locations, Monument Valley. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ``EATING WELL FOR OPTIMUM HEALTH'' &QL; 
 &UR; By Andrew Weil (Knopf, $25) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There's a chapter here in which Weil sets out to devise what he
calls ``the worst diet in the world,'' which after a few paragraphs
sounded so suspiciously like our own bill of fare that we began to
wonder whether Weil had us under surveillance. It was humbling, but
more fun to read than, say, the section called ``A Healing Story:
From French Fries to Kale,'' or ``The Macronutrients: An
Overview.'' But we are not hopeless, no siree. We love broccoli. We
love salmon. Unfortunately, we have learned from Weil that not all
salmon are equal, that we need to worry not only about our own
diets but about the diets of the fish we eat, which is one step
further down the food chain than we care to go. Eggs are another
research project. ``Eggs of chickens,'' Weil writes, ``(are) good
sources of omega-3 fatty acids if they come from free-range
chickens or chickens whose diets are supplemented with omega-3-rich
algae.'' Are we up to this task? No, but we know that Weil has made
many converts-to-wellness, so rush to the store: His new book is
out, with the author looking hale and hearty on the cover.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``TIGERS IN THE SNOW''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By Peter Matthiessen (North Point, $27) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Most of us know that the tiger is beautiful, but we also have
been raised with an unshakable idea of its fierceness, the
fearsome, predatory aggression of Shere Khan in Rudyard Kipling's
``The Jungle Book.'' But Matthiessen points out that the hunter,
Jim Corbett, in his book ``The Man-eaters of Kumaon,'' refers to
the tiger as ``a large-hearted gentleman of bottomless courage.''
That's what this book aims to give you _ a new look at the tiger,
at its history, its endangered habitats, its dwindling numbers, its
extreme vulnerability to poachers, and finally, at the efforts of
researchers and wildlife biologists to study and preserve it. The
book also conveys the quiet majesty of the animal, largely through
the author's eloquent interest and regard for it. With an
introduction and color photographs by Maurice Hornocker, tiger
expert and co-founder of the Siberian Tiger Project. Matthiessen's
fans should also look for ``The Peter Matthiessen Reader''
(Vintage, $14), in which editor McKay Jenkins assembles excerpts
from the author's books of non-fiction, including ``The Snow
Leopard'' and ``Men's Lives.'' &QL;

BLEAK WORKS BELIE WRITER RICK MOODY'S
 JOY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service
 clients)  
 By BARBARA YOST  
   
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; (EDITORS: RETRANSMITTING; ALSO MOVING IN
 &UR; THE ``L'' CATEGORY)
 &UR; Never mind that his novels employ less-than-joyful themes _
electrocution, prepubescent sex, ailing mothers who dribble
``stalactites of drool,'' drug addiction, self-immolation, Richard
Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   Moody has written such bleak stories as ``The Ice Storm,'' which
became the bleak 1997 Ang Lee-directed movie starring Kevin Klein
and Sigourney Weaver.
</P>
<P>
   Writing gloom under cover of mirth, he follows a daily regimen
but works only when the spirit moves him. At his home on Fishers
Island in Long Island Sound, he might write by day or he might
write all night, a comfortable schedule that fosters bliss.
</P>
<P>
   ``My hypothesis is that the best way to convey joy to my readers
is if I am joyful when I'm on the job,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Joy brings productivity. At age 38, he's already published three
novels (``The Ice Storm,'' `` Garden State, Purple America''), a
collection of short stories (``The Ring of Brightest Angels Around
Heaven'') and edited a collection of essays titled ``Joyful Noise''
_ and there's that word again.
</P>
<P>
   Although Moody has been variously compared to the greats who
preceded him _ Cheever, Roth, Updike _ he modestly dismisses such
accolades, eschewing public-relations hype while recognizing that
hype and a hit movie have made him a marketable author who so far
can depend on each new work's being accepted by his publisher.
</P>
<P>
   Acclaim also drags him into the Okefenokee Swamp of the book
tour, slogging across America to tout his latest work, leaving
behind his longtime companion, Amy, a computer-software writer who
comes along only to the more attractive cities.
</P>
<P>
   Amy will be coming along when Moody speaks during the Phoenix
Public Library's lecture series, ``Soothing Words,'' a three-month
event that began in January. This month's featured writers include
Moody on Thursday, March 16.
</P>
<P>
   Moody will appear at 7 p.m. at the Burton Barr Phoenix Central
Library to read from his coming collection of stories,
``Demonology,'' due out in January.2001.)
</P>
<P>
   Then he and Amy will head for his father's winter home in
Wickenburg, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Moody is a writer's writer, besotted by the English
language, heir to legendary wordsmiths Hemingway, Fitzgerald,
Joyce, Bellow, Beckett. He loves words as a writer because he loves
words as a reader and sprinkles his conversation with literary
quotations.
</P>
<P>
   Moody's own work is highly stylized _ too much so, some critics
say. But he prides himself on writing that has become denser over
the course of three novels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've made language exciting again,'' he says, less a boast
than an exaltation in the sheer beauty of well-crafted prose.
</P>
<P>
   Moody has been writing for 30 years. As a boy, he dabbled, but
he was easily distracted by other boyhood occupations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lacked follow-through,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Childhood in suburban Connecticut appeared idyllic from the
outside, but he confesses to harboring ``demons,'' suffering
frequent illnesses and being overly sensitive.
</P>
<P>
   The sensitivity that plagued him in his youth has served him
well as an adult observer of human emotions. He credits his
``finely calibrated compass that picks up what's going on in a
room.''
</P>
<P>
   In his teens, Moody began to write in earnest, producing short
stories and poems.
</P>
<P>
   Son of literary parents, he majored in English at Brown
University and began to write ``Garden State'' in 1986 while living
in Hoboken, N.J., holding down a day job in the editorial
department of the Simon &AMP; Schuster publishing house.
</P>
<P>
   Although the job slowed work on his novel, it taught him the
intricacies of the publishing business _ how to find an agent, how
to write a contract. It did not help sell his book, which was
rejected 22 times in a 15-month period.
</P>
<P>
   Moody despaired of drowning in the seas of rejection. Then, a
small press called Pushcart threw him a lifeline and even awarded
him its Pushcart Editors' Book Award.
</P>
<P>
   Work on his second novel, ``The Ice Storm,'' began in 1990.
Having quit his day job, he was able to write more swiftly,
completing the book in just two years. He was single then,
supporting himself on freelance editing and living hand to mouth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Ice Storm'' was accepted by big-time publisher Little,
Brown and Co., and Moody forged a relationship with an editor who
respects his distinctive style.
</P>
<P>
   Moody became proficient at his craft.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured out how to tell a story,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Moody tries to do something different with each of his works,
their thread ``fealty to human emotions and human psychology.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Garden State'' is the story of disaffected youth lost in
suburban New Jersey, contemplating life, death and rock and roll.
</P>
<P>
   ``Purple America'' is a deeply emotional book that examines how
one family's remorse ``trickles down through the generations.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Black Veil,'' a non-fiction work due out this summer,
comes from family folklore about the Rev. Joseph Moody, said to
have inspired ``The Minister's Black Veil,'' a short story by
American author Nathaniel Hawthorne.
</P>
<P>
   But ``The Ice Storm'' has been his bestseller, thanks in part to
the movie. The grim saga traces a brief span in the life of
Benjamin Hood, a suburbanite bored with marriage who dallies with a
neighbor, struggles to rein in his precocious daughter, Wendy, and
tries to discover himself during the sexual liberation of the
1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Moody was warned to fear the worst from Hollywood, and ``I DID
fear the worst.''
</P>
<P>
   Meeting the respected Ang Lee, who also directed ``Sense and
Sensibility,'' allayed those fears. One red flag raised was the
casting of Christina Ricci, who had appeared in such films as ``The
Addams Family'' and ``Casper.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ricci's teen sexpot portrayal impressed Moody, as did the
film as a whole. Now he is waiting to hear about options on his
other works. Buoyed by his positive experiences with ``The Ice
Storm,'' he would happily return to Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   With such success comes book tours, not the choicest part of the
profession. One tour took Moody on the road for five grueling
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But he enjoys meeting his readers, most of whom are under age
40.
</P>
<P>
   Writing is an isolating profession, after all, he notes as he
sits alone in his home on Fishers Island, while Amy lives across
the water in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   It is Amy who reads his work first and then filters the reviews,
passing along only those that offer constructive criticism.
Although wary of shaping his style to please critics, Moody says he
sometimes can learn from them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I trust in the possibility that some harsh criticism will give
me an opportunity to improve,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   And improvement brings joy. &QL; Reach the reporter at

BLEAK WORKS BELIE WRITER RICK MOODY'S
 JOY 
</HEADLINE>

 By BARBARA YOST  
   
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; (EDITORS: RETRANSMITTING; ALSO MOVING IN
 &UR; THE ``E'' CATEGORY)
 &UR; Never mind that his novels employ less-than-joyful themes _
electrocution, prepubescent sex, ailing mothers who dribble
``stalactites of drool,'' drug addiction, self-immolation, Richard
Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   Moody has written such bleak stories as ``The Ice Storm,'' which
became the bleak 1997 Ang Lee-directed movie starring Kevin Klein
and Sigourney Weaver.
</P>
<P>
   Writing gloom under cover of mirth, he follows a daily regimen
but works only when the spirit moves him. At his home on Fishers
Island in Long Island Sound, he might write by day or he might
write all night, a comfortable schedule that fosters bliss.
</P>
<P>
   ``My hypothesis is that the best way to convey joy to my readers
is if I am joyful when I'm on the job,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Joy brings productivity. At age 38, he's already published three
novels (``The Ice Storm,'' `` Garden State, Purple America''), a
collection of short stories (``The Ring of Brightest Angels Around
Heaven'') and edited a collection of essays titled ``Joyful Noise''
_ and there's that word again.
</P>
<P>
   Although Moody has been variously compared to the greats who
preceded him _ Cheever, Roth, Updike _ he modestly dismisses such
accolades, eschewing public-relations hype while recognizing that
hype and a hit movie have made him a marketable author who so far
can depend on each new work's being accepted by his publisher.
</P>
<P>
   Acclaim also drags him into the Okefenokee Swamp of the book
tour, slogging across America to tout his latest work, leaving
behind his longtime companion, Amy, a computer-software writer who
comes along only to the more attractive cities.
</P>
<P>
   Amy will be coming along when Moody speaks during the Phoenix
Public Library's lecture series, ``Soothing Words,'' a three-month
event that began in January. This month's featured writers include
Moody on Thursday, March 16.
</P>
<P>
   Moody will appear at 7 p.m. at the Burton Barr Phoenix Central
Library to read from his coming collection of stories,
``Demonology,'' due out in January.2001.)
</P>
<P>
   Then he and Amy will head for his father's winter home in
Wickenburg, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Moody is a writer's writer, besotted by the English
language, heir to legendary wordsmiths Hemingway, Fitzgerald,
Joyce, Bellow, Beckett. He loves words as a writer because he loves
words as a reader and sprinkles his conversation with literary
quotations.
</P>
<P>
   Moody's own work is highly stylized _ too much so, some critics
say. But he prides himself on writing that has become denser over
the course of three novels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've made language exciting again,'' he says, less a boast
than an exaltation in the sheer beauty of well-crafted prose.
</P>
<P>
   Moody has been writing for 30 years. As a boy, he dabbled, but
he was easily distracted by other boyhood occupations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lacked follow-through,'' he says.
</P>
<P>

DINOSAURS' EVOLUTION CONTINUES EVEN
 TODAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service
 clients)  
 By RICHARD NILSEN  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
 (EDITORS: RETRANSMITTING  /  ALSO MOVED IN
 THE ``E'' CATEGORY) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dinosaurs keep evolving. It doesn't matter that they died out en
masse 65 million years ago, that not a single giant lizard remains
alive, even in some remote and steamy Amazonian plateau. None of
that matters: They evolve anyway.
</P>
<P>
   They evolved from cold-blooded sluggards to warm-blooded
amphetamine addicts. They grew feathers. The carnivores bent over
from the anthropomorphized Godzilla posture they used to have to
something a lot more like a gigantic clucking hen.
</P>
<P>
   Such changes shouldn't be surprising. As scholarship advances,
our images of the dinosaurs have had to step forward, too. But it
isn't only paleontology that has caused the changes in our sense of
prehistoric life. It is also politics.
</P>
<P>
   We have a more inclusive sense of culture these days, so the
primarily European and North American bias we have had in the past
about our Mesozoic predecessors has changed to make room for Asia,
Africa and South America.
</P>
<P>
   When I was a boy, fascinated by everything dinosaurian in the
1950s, there were about 20 or so beasts that made up the
``canonical'' list of dinosaurs. They included brontosaurs,
stegosaurs, tyrannosaurs, triceratops and a variety of oddly
ornamented hadrosaurs.
</P>
<P>
   These were the basic animals that populated our vision of a
misty, green tropical prehistory. They are the beasts of ``King
Kong, Lost World'' and dozens of other pop culture permutations of
the terrible lizards.
</P>
<P>
   They also were the fossils found in Wyoming, Utah and New
Jersey. They were ``our'' dinosaurs, and they somehow seemed more
important for that.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, there were always more genera of fossil than the popular
ones. And with a recent explosion in dino digs, the number of
official dinosaur genera has increased to something like 350. And
that is just genera: Several of them also include multiple species.
By one count, there are 15 species of triceratops.
</P>
<P>
   The increase in the popular awareness of dinosaur genera _ as
evidenced in many of the recent books on the subject for the
general reader _ is as much a change in our openness to diversity
as it is the number of new fossils found.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, a few ``representative types'' were enough to
define the prehistoric world. But now, those types _ and their
origins _ seem too limited.
</P>
<P>
   And further evidence of this are the many names for dinosaurs
that sound multiculti on the tongue: jubbulpuria (India);
yangchuanosaurus (China); austrosaurus (Australia); majungasaurus
(Africa); riojasaurus (Argentina). There is even an antarctosaurus.
</P>
<P>
   And from the Navajo Reservation in northern Arizona comes the
segisaurus, from Tsegi Canyon.
</P>
<P>
   Just open the new book, ``Walking With Dinosaurs: A Natural
History'' (DK Publishing, $25), and there on a single page you find
leaellynasaura, muttaburrasaurus and koolasuchus, names with a
decidedly third-world flavor on the tongue.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt there is a long way to go before the laplatasaurus of
South America supplants the more familiar North American
apatosaurus (formerly the brontosaurus) in third-graders'
imaginations, but open up any recent book on the subject and you
will find newer, sexier and more politically diverse dinosaurs
showing up.
</P>
<P>
   Prehistory now seems as diverse as today. &QL;

LDS CHURCH OFTEN STILL MISUNDERSTOOD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service

 By MAUREEN JENKINS  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; (RETRANSMITTING: EDITORS: INCLUDES KEY
 &UR; POINTS, LIST OF BELIEFS AT END OF TAKE.
 &UR; ALSO MOVING IN THE ``L'' CATEGORY) PHOENIX _ In some ways, the
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is a quintessential
American success story.
</P>
<P>
   Fleeing religious and political persecution in the 1840s,
members of this newly established church left Nauvoo, Ill., and
trekked west, setting up colonies and a distinct way of life. A
century and a half later, the little church organized by Joseph
Smith is one of the fastest-growing religions in the Americas &UR; and
across the globe, as well as the richest church per capita in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   So, why is the Mormon Church still so maligned and little
understood within some Christian circles?
</P>
<P>
   This never-quite-resolved question again moved to the forefront
with an ``East Valley Tribune'' story headlined ``Christian fest
snubs Mormons,'' referring to the Jan. 15 Festival of Faith 2000
event at Bank One Ballpark in Phoenix. A gathering billed as the
largest-ever ecumenical assembly of Christians in Arizona history,
it attracted 35,000 people from about 400 Protestant, Catholic and
Orthodox congregations.
</P>
<P>
   The Latter-day Saints, however, were not among these.
</P>
<P>
   Initially included in the festival's planning, the Mormon Church
later found itself excluded, apparently because some conservative
organizers didn't consider Latter-day Saints to be Christians.
</P>
<P>
   ``In an ideal world, there would be total acceptance, total
understanding, total love,'' said the Rev. Paul Eppinger, executive
director of the Arizona Ecumenical Council and a Festival of Faith
lead organizer. ``But unfortunately, we do not live in an ideal
world and therefore, in our desire to make the Christian church
more understanding of each group, there are first steps we must
take, then the second step, the third step, the fourth step.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting Evangelicals, mainline Protestants, Catholics and
Eastern Orthodox Christians to meet with each other was that first
step. Broadening the ecumenical net to include churches such as the
Latter-day Saints clearly would be another.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of this issue lie matters of doctrine and theology
_ and the notion of just WHO is a Christian.
</P>
<P>
   Evangelicals who believe in literal biblical interpretation say
the Mormons aren't. The Latter-day Saints, who believe their faith
is a restoration of the original church founded by Jesus Christ and
his 12 disciples, claim they belong to the true Christian church. &QL; 
ROOTS OF DISAGREEMENT &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But just who creates the yardstick that determines which
denominations are Christians? And what standard are these groups
measured against?
</P>
<P>
   Is it a historical faith believed to be derived from the intent
of Jesus' teachings? Or is it the European-spawned brand of
Catholicism and Protestantism, with its various creeds and
traditions influenced by culture?
</P>
<P>
   And does a church's definition of itself determine where it fits
on the religious landscape?
</P>
<P>
   Although the Mormon Church is neither Catholic nor Protestant,
says Phoenix metro area spokesman Wilford Andersen, it's no less
Christian.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people understand we can respectfully disagree on
matters of Christian doctrine,'' Andersen said, ``but should never
disagree on Christian conduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``There certainly are some (churches) who find it difficult to
work together with us, and I respect that as long as we don't have
ill will toward each other and as long as we don't have
misinformation.''
</P>
<P>
   Which, of course, is the crux of the rift between Mormons and
evangelical Christians.
</P>
<P>
   Richard N. Ostling, co-author of the acclaimed ``Mormon America:
The Power and the Promise'' (HarperSanFrancisco, $26), says the LDS
Church's ``sweeping policy of secrecy'' contributes to the faith
being misunderstood in mainstream American religious culture. Its
weddings are held in temples that require church-issued
``recommends'' to enter, meaning non-Mormons never get inside. Even
the church's governing documents _ the sort that many denominations
publish on their Web sites _ are off-limits to outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you have this situation, it creates rumors,
speculations, misinformation,'' said Ostling, who wrote ``Mormon
America'' with his wife, Joan K. Ostling. ``There is room for a lot
of confusion.``
</P>
<P>
   Not that Mormons and their conservative Christian critics tend
to disagree much on matters of morality and social values. Both
groups stress the importance of family and personal responsibility,
and decry abortion, gambling and same-sex unions.
</P>
<P>
   In California, for example, a coalition of Southern Baptists,
Catholics and Mormons recently joined forces to pass Proposition 22
on Tuesday, which would ban same-sex marriages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the disagreement is doctrinal,'' Ostling said,
``rather than moral, political and cultural. The fundamental issues
between Mormonism and traditional Christianity are the nature of
God, the doctrine of Christ, the Bible's authority, and the
doctrine of humanity and relating to God.''
</P>
<P>
   Attempting to examine the commonalities and differences between
the groups, professors Craig L. Blomberg of Denver Seminary and
Stephen E. Robinson of Brigham Young University wrote the 1997
book, ``How Wide the Divide? A Mormon and an Evangelical in
Conversation'' (InterVarsity Press, $11.99).
</P>
<P>
   Their point-counterpoint text includes a ``joint conclusion'' at
the end of each chapter and doesn't dwell on trying to prove the
other wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Andersen says this civil tolerance and respect _ rather than
active teaching against other religions _ is central to Mormon
faith. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DIFFERENT, YET SIMILAR &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ostling says it's ``almost predictable'' that Mormons and
evangelicals butt heads theologically, as both target the same
group of potential converts.
</P>
<P>
   Marie Cornwall, a sociology professor at the LDS Church's
Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah, agrees.
</P>
<P>
   Many sociologists believe the animosity between the groups
exists because ``we share the same niche,'' Cornwall said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can use that marketplace language, both Evangelicals
and Mormons share the same target: the unchurched,'' she adds. ``We
compete in the marketplace of religion, and evangelicals want to
make sure their targets realize Mormons are different.''
</P>
<P>
   Ostling thinks today's Mormon Church, especially under current
President Gordon B. Hinckley's administration, goes ``back and
forth'' on positioning itself closer to ``mainstream''
Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mormonism probably presents less of its doctrine to persons
before baptism than any other religious group I can think of,'' he
said. ``The key to winning converts and solidifying them in the
faith is the community, and not the isolated individual. Some of
the more complex doctrinal areas are left for later on.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Andersen says the church doesn't dilute its theology
just to make connections with potential members or other
Christians.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past several decades, the church has sought
opportunities to team up with other faiths in humanitarian efforts.
</P>
<P>
   In the Phoenix area, LDS Church members belong to the InterFaith
Action Coalition of Arizona, which is composed of representatives
of 12 different faiths, from Jewish to Buddhist to Christian.
</P>
<P>
   Mormons' involvement in such groups across the nation probably
is a trickle-down effect of Hinckley's public relations-savvy
administration, which is trying to build bridges with other
religions while highlighting positive aspects of Mormon life.
</P>
<P>
   Cornwall says Hinckley's just-released book, ``Standing for
Something: 10 Neglected Virtues That Will Heal Our Hearts and
Homes'' (Times Books, $24.00), is one such effort, capitalizing on
Americans' interest in back-to-basic values without hitting readers
over the head with Mormon theology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mormons want to be both different and the same (as other
Americans),'' Cornwall said. ``Different in the sense we know our
faith is different from other faiths, but the same in that we want
people to see that we can be as successful as anybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   And it's establishing this common ground, Andersen says, that
will ultimately break down barriers, both social and doctrinal,
that stand between faith groups. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
SOME FACTS ABOUT THE CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST OF LATTER-DAY SAINTS: &QL; 
 &QL; 
_One of the world's fastest-growing religions, the LDS Church
claims 10.3 million members, with just more than half living
outside the United States. About one-sixth of LDS members live in
Utah. &QL; 
_If the LDS Church were a U.S. corporation, its revenues would
place it No. 243 on the ``Fortune'' 500 list. &QL; 
_The Mormon Church is one of the nation's largest landowners, with
property equal to the size of Delaware. &QL; 
_Unlike most churches, the LDS Church has no professional clergy.
Members take turns speaking at Sunday sacrament meetings, or
worship services. Members also serve in unpaid ``callings,'' or
assignments, that get work done throughout the church. &QL; 
_Some of the church's best-known members include Steve Young, a San
Francisco 49ers quarterback; singers Donny and Marie Osmond and
Gladys Knight; Stephen R. Covey, bestselling author of ``7 Habits
of Highly Effective People''; and Orrin Hatch, a Utah senator and
former presidential candidate. &QL; 
_Until 1978, Black men were not ordained to the lay priesthood _ a
position reversed by official declaration of then-President Spencer
W. Kimball. Today, R&AMP;B singer Knight is probably the Mormon
Church's best-known Black member. &QL;

   &UR; (RETRANSMITTING: EDITORS: INCLUDES KEY
 &UR; POINTS, LIST OF BELIEFS AT END OF TAKE.
 &UR; ALSO MOVING IN THE ``A'' CATEGORY) PHOENIX _ In some ways, the
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is a quintessential
American success story.
</P>
<P>
   Fleeing religious and political persecution in the 1840s,
members of this newly established church left Nauvoo, Ill., and
trekked west, setting up colonies and a distinct way of life. A
century and a half later, the little church organized by Joseph
Smith is one of the fastest-growing religions in the Americas &UR; and
across the globe, as well as the richest church per capita in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   So, why is the Mormon Church still so maligned and little
understood within some Christian circles?
</P>
<P>
   This never-quite-resolved question again moved to the forefront
with an ``East Valley Tribune'' story headlined ``Christian fest
snubs Mormons,'' referring to the Jan. 15 Festival of Faith 2000
event at Bank One Ballpark in Phoenix. A gathering billed as the
largest-ever ecumenical assembly of Christians in Arizona history,
it attracted 35,000 people from about 400 Protestant, Catholic and
Orthodox congregations.
</P>
<P>
   The Latter-day Saints, however, were not among these.
</P>
<P>
   Initially included in the festival's planning, the Mormon Church
later found itself excluded, apparently because some conservative
organizers didn't consider Latter-day Saints to be Christians.
</P>
<P>
   ``In an ideal world, there would be total acceptance, total
understanding, total love,'' said the Rev. Paul Eppinger, executive
director of the Arizona Ecumenical Council and a Festival of Faith
lead organizer. ``But unfortunately, we do not live in an ideal
world and therefore, in our desire to make the Christian church
more understanding of each group, there are first steps we must
take, then the second step, the third step, the fourth step.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting Evangelicals, mainline Protestants, Catholics and
Eastern Orthodox Christians to meet with each other was that first
step. Broadening the ecumenical net to include churches such as the
Latter-day Saints clearly would be another.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of this issue lie matters of doctrine and theology
_ and the notion of just WHO is a Christian.
</P>
<P>
   Evangelicals who believe in literal biblical interpretation say
the Mormons aren't. The Latter-day Saints, who believe their faith
is a restoration of the original church founded by Jesus Christ and
his 12 disciples, claim they belong to the true Christian church. &QL; 
ROOTS OF DISAGREEMENT &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But just who creates the yardstick that determines which
denominations are Christians? And what standard are these groups
measured against?
</P>
<P>
   Is it a historical faith believed to be derived from the intent
of Jesus' teachings? Or is it the European-spawned brand of
Catholicism and Protestantism, with its various creeds and
traditions influenced by culture?
</P>
<P>
   And does a church's definition of itself determine where it fits
on the religious landscape?
</P>
<P>
   Although the Mormon Church is neither Catholic nor Protestant,
says Phoenix metro area spokesman Wilford Andersen, it's no less
Christian.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people understand we can respectfully disagree on
matters of Christian doctrine,'' Andersen said, ``but should never
disagree on Christian conduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``There certainly are some (churches) who find it difficult to
work together with us, and I respect that as long as we don't have
ill will toward each other and as long as we don't have
misinformation.''
</P>
<P>
   Which, of course, is the crux of the rift between Mormons and
evangelical Christians.
</P>
<P>
   Richard N. Ostling, co-author of the acclaimed ``Mormon America:
The Power and the Promise'' (HarperSanFrancisco, $26), says the LDS
Church's ``sweeping policy of secrecy'' contributes to the faith
being misunderstood in mainstream American religious culture. Its
weddings are held in temples that require church-issued
``recommends'' to enter, meaning non-Mormons never get inside. Even
the church's governing documents _ the sort that many denominations
publish on their Web sites _ are off-limits to outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you have this situation, it creates rumors,
speculations, misinformation,'' said Ostling, who wrote ``Mormon
America'' with his wife, Joan K. Ostling. ``There is room for a lot
of confusion.``
</P>
<P>
   Not that Mormons and their conservative Christian critics tend
to disagree much on matters of morality and social values. Both
groups stress the importance of family and personal responsibility,
and decry abortion, gambling and same-sex unions.
</P>
<P>
   In California, for example, a coalition of Southern Baptists,
Catholics and Mormons recently joined forces to pass Proposition 22
on Tuesday, which would ban same-sex marriages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the disagreement is doctrinal,'' Ostling said,
``rather than moral, political and cultural. The fundamental issues
between Mormonism and traditional Christianity are the nature of
God, the doctrine of Christ, the Bible's authority, and the
doctrine of humanity and relating to God.''
</P>
<P>
   Attempting to examine the commonalities and differences between
the groups, professors Craig L. Blomberg of Denver Seminary and
Stephen E. Robinson of Brigham Young University wrote the 1997
book, ``How Wide the Divide? A Mormon and an Evangelical in
Conversation'' (InterVarsity Press, $11.99).
</P>
<P>
   Their point-counterpoint text includes a ``joint conclusion'' at
the end of each chapter and doesn't dwell on trying to prove the
other wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Andersen says this civil tolerance and respect _ rather than
active teaching against other religions _ is central to Mormon
faith. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DIFFERENT, YET SIMILAR &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ostling says it's ``almost predictable'' that Mormons and
evangelicals butt heads theologically, as both target the same
group of potential converts.
</P>
<P>
   Marie Cornwall, a sociology professor at the LDS Church's
Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah, agrees.
</P>
<P>
   Many sociologists believe the animosity between the groups
exists because ``we share the same niche,'' Cornwall said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can use that marketplace language, both Evangelicals
and Mormons share the same target: the unchurched,'' she adds. ``We
compete in the marketplace of religion, and evangelicals want to
make sure their targets realize Mormons are different.''
</P>
<P>
   Ostling thinks today's Mormon Church, especially under current
President Gordon B. Hinckley's administration, goes ``back and
forth'' on positioning itself closer to ``mainstream''
Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mormonism probably presents less of its doctrine to persons
before baptism than any other religious group I can think of,'' he
said. ``The key to winning converts and solidifying them in the
faith is the community, and not the isolated individual. Some of
the more complex doctrinal areas are left for later on.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Andersen says the church doesn't dilute its theology
just to make connections with potential members or other
Christians.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past several decades, the church has sought
opportunities to team up with other faiths in humanitarian efforts.
</P>
<P>
   In the Phoenix area, LDS Church members belong to the InterFaith
Action Coalition of Arizona, which is composed of representatives
of 12 different faiths, from Jewish to Buddhist to Christian.
</P>
<P>
   Mormons' involvement in such groups across the nation probably
is a trickle-down effect of Hinckley's public relations-savvy
administration, which is trying to build bridges with other
religions while highlighting positive aspects of Mormon life.
</P>
<P>
   Cornwall says Hinckley's just-released book, ``Standing for
Something: 10 Neglected Virtues That Will Heal Our Hearts and
Homes'' (Times Books, $24.00), is one such effort, capitalizing on
Americans' interest in back-to-basic values without hitting readers
over the head with Mormon theology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mormons want to be both different and the same (as other
Americans),'' Cornwall said. ``Different in the sense we know our
faith is different from other faiths, but the same in that we want
people to see that we can be as successful as anybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   And it's establishing this common ground, Andersen says, that
will ultimately break down barriers, both social and doctrinal,
that stand between faith groups. &QL;

SOME FACTS ABOUT THE CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST OF LATTER-DAY SAINTS: &QL; 
 &QL; 
_One of the world's fastest-growing religions, the LDS Church
claims 10.3 million members, with just more than half living
outside the United States. About one-sixth of LDS members live in
Utah. &QL;

<P>
   Dinosaurs keep evolving. It doesn't matter that they died out en
masse 65 million years ago, that not a single giant lizard remains
alive, even in some remote and steamy Amazonian plateau. None of
that matters: They evolve anyway.
</P>
<P>
   They evolved from cold-blooded sluggards to warm-blooded
amphetamine addicts. They grew feathers. The carnivores bent over
from the anthropomorphized Godzilla posture they used to have to
something a lot more like a gigantic clucking hen.
</P>
<P>
   Such changes shouldn't be surprising. As scholarship advances,
our images of the dinosaurs have had to step forward, too. But it
isn't only paleontology that has caused the changes in our sense of
prehistoric life. It is also politics.
</P>
<P>
   We have a more inclusive sense of culture these days, so the
primarily European and North American bias we have had in the past
about our Mesozoic predecessors has changed to make room for Asia,
Africa and South America.
</P>
<P>
   When I was a boy, fascinated by everything dinosaurian in the
1950s, there were about 20 or so beasts that made up the
``canonical'' list of dinosaurs. They included brontosaurs,
stegosaurs, tyrannosaurs, triceratops and a variety of oddly
ornamented hadrosaurs.
</P>
<P>
   These were the basic animals that populated our vision of a
misty, green tropical prehistory. They are the beasts of ``King
Kong, Lost World'' and dozens of other pop culture permutations of
the terrible lizards.
</P>
<P>
   They also were the fossils found in Wyoming, Utah and New
Jersey. They were ``our'' dinosaurs, and they somehow seemed more
important for that.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, there were always more genera of fossil than the popular
ones. And with a recent explosion in dino digs, the number of
official dinosaur genera has increased to something like 350. And
that is just genera: Several of them also include multiple species.
By one count, there are 15 species of triceratops.
</P>
<P>
   The increase in the popular awareness of dinosaur genera _ as
evidenced in many of the recent books on the subject for the
general reader _ is as much a change in our openness to diversity
as it is the number of new fossils found.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, a few ``representative types'' were enough to
define the prehistoric world. But now, those types _ and their
origins _ seem too limited.
</P>
<P>
   And further evidence of this are the many names for dinosaurs
that sound multiculti on the tongue: jubbulpuria (India);
yangchuanosaurus (China); austrosaurus (Australia); majungasaurus
(Africa); riojasaurus (Argentina). There is even an antarctosaurus.
</P>
<P>
   And from the Navajo Reservation in northern Arizona comes the
segisaurus, from Tsegi Canyon.
</P>
<P>
   Just open the new book, ``Walking With Dinosaurs: A Natural
History'' (DK Publishing, $25), and there on a single page you find
leaellynasaura, muttaburrasaurus and koolasuchus, names with a
decidedly third-world flavor on the tongue.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt there is a long way to go before the laplatasaurus of
South America supplants the more familiar North American
apatosaurus (formerly the brontosaurus) in third-graders'
imaginations, but open up any recent book on the subject and you
will find newer, sexier and more politically diverse dinosaurs
showing up.
</P>
<P>
   Prehistory now seems as diverse as today. &QL;

 &UR; THE ``E'' CATEGORY) &QL; 
Here are Anne Stephenson's capsule reviews of new books:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``AFTERBURN'' &QL; 
 &UR; By Colin Harrison (FSG, $25) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The thing about thrillers is that so many of them are bad.
Abysmal, even. It's a genre so plagued by hack writers and
bush-league prose that when you find one like this, you want to
call it by another name. But a thriller it is _ the long, patient
kind, with underplayed dialogue and characters who sidestep
stereotype every time it shows up to claim them. The protagonist is
Charlie Ravich, a former Vietnam fighter pilot and POW now in his
late 50s who faces crisis in his private life and in his
multimillion-dollar corporate affairs. Harrison spends much of his
book establishing a thin connection between Charlie and a young
woman named Christina Welles, who has just been released from
prison and who, with her former boyfriend, is suspected of stealing
from a mobster who really, REALLY, wants his money back. There's
sex. There's violence (we don't want to spoil your fun if you have
a taste for it, but for the sake of the squeamish, we'll mention a
little torture scene involving an electric drill and a circular saw
_ and that's not the last of it). If you can take the gore, this
book is enough to give a weak genre a good name. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ``CINEMA SOUTHWEST'' &QL; 
 &UR; By John A. Murray (Northland, $21.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The photo on the cover is of John Ford making a scene from ``The
Searchers'' in 1956, but that's just the predictable side of
filmmaking in the American Southwest. Think of the alternatives. In
1965, Max Von Sydow, as Jesus, delivered the Sermon on the Mount on
Utah's Green River Overlook in ``The Greatest Story Ever Told.''
Dennis Hopper and Peter Fonda camped in Anasazi ruins on their way
east in ``Easy Rider.'' Robert Duvall turned his life around on the
Texas prairie in ``Tender Mercies,'' and in ``Bonnie and Clyde,''
Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway robbed an actual bank in the rural
community of Pilot Point, Texas _ the same bank that the real
Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow had robbed about 40 years earlier.
In this book, due out at the end of the month, Murray looks at the
Southwest and its starring role in so many American films. Included
are some great photographs _ our favorite, we confess, is of John
Wayne (in ``She Wore a Yellow Ribbon'') looking grandly out at that
mist-shrouded Big Daddy of film locations, Monument Valley. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ``EATING WELL FOR OPTIMUM HEALTH'' &QL; 
 &UR; By Andrew Weil (Knopf, $25) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There's a chapter here in which Weil sets out to devise what he
calls ``the worst diet in the world,'' which after a few paragraphs
sounded so suspiciously like our own bill of fare that we began to
wonder whether Weil had us under surveillance. It was humbling, but
more fun to read than, say, the section called ``A Healing Story:
From French Fries to Kale,'' or ``The Macronutrients: An
Overview.'' But we are not hopeless, no siree. We love broccoli. We
love salmon. Unfortunately, we have learned from Weil that not all
salmon are equal, that we need to worry not only about our own
diets but about the diets of the fish we eat, which is one step
further down the food chain than we care to go. Eggs are another
research project. ``Eggs of chickens,'' Weil writes, ``(are) good
sources of omega-3 fatty acids if they come from free-range
chickens or chickens whose diets are supplemented with omega-3-rich
algae.'' Are we up to this task? No, but we know that Weil has made
many converts-to-wellness, so rush to the store: His new book is
out, with the author looking hale and hearty on the cover.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``TIGERS IN THE SNOW''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By Peter Matthiessen (North Point, $27) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Most of us know that the tiger is beautiful, but we also have
been raised with an unshakable idea of its fierceness, the
fearsome, predatory aggression of Shere Khan in Rudyard Kipling's
``The Jungle Book.'' But Matthiessen points out that the hunter,
Jim Corbett, in his book ``The Man-eaters of Kumaon,'' refers to
the tiger as ``a large-hearted gentleman of bottomless courage.''
That's what this book aims to give you _ a new look at the tiger,
at its history, its endangered habitats, its dwindling numbers, its
extreme vulnerability to poachers, and finally, at the efforts of
researchers and wildlife biologists to study and preserve it. The
book also conveys the quiet majesty of the animal, largely through
the author's eloquent interest and regard for it. With an
introduction and color photographs by Maurice Hornocker, tiger
expert and co-founder of the Siberian Tiger Project. Matthiessen's
fans should also look for ``The Peter Matthiessen Reader''
(Vintage, $14), in which editor McKay Jenkins assembles excerpts
from the author's books of non-fiction, including ``The Snow
Leopard'' and ``Men's Lives.'' &QL;

&HT;     FOR MARCH, A WEALTH OF READING ON IRELAND 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By BOBBIE HESS  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the publishing world, the month of March is the time to
bring out all books related to Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Among this year's best is Terry Golway's ``For the Cause of
Liberty _ A Thousand Years of Ireland's Heroes'' (Simon and
Schuster, $26, 335 pages).
</P>
<P>
   In 1155, the English first sent troops to Ireland, a land
populated by the Gaels, the descendants of the Celts. ``Detached
not only from the (European) continent but from the neighboring
island to the east (England), the Gaels were different, different
in their practice of Christianity, different in their law and
customs. Religious irregularities such as divorce and the active
leadership of women in religious life were permitted in Gaelic
Christianity, while little heed was paid to the papacy. Ireland had
a vibrant, distinctive literature, filled with heroic tales of
pagan warriors. ... The most famous of these legendary warriors was
Cuchulain, a great champion who was slain in defense of his
homeland.''
</P>
<P>
   So many of Ireland's heroes fought for Ireland's freedom. Some
fought with weapons, some with words. Some were male, some were
female. Some were Catholic, some were Protestant. Some died for
Ireland, some lived to fight on. Some became famous, some were
known only by a few. All fought for what they believed in.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Boru defeated the Vikings in 1014. Red Hugh O'Donnell
fought the English in 1601 and lost. Patrick Sarsfield led the
rebels at the Battle of the Boyne in 1690 and was defeated. In
1729, Jonathan Swift wrote ``A Modest Proposal'' _ a satire dealing
with the plight of the poor after three years of famine. Wolfe Tone
led a failed rebellion in 1798 and killed himself before the
authorities could hang him. In the 1930s, Daniel ``The Liberator''
O'Connell worked in alliance with British liberals and ``he won
reforms that eased the plight of the Irish Catholic masses.''
</P>
<P>
   Jane Francesca Elgee wrote militant poetry under the pen name
Speranza:
</P>
<P>
   Abject tears and prayers submissive _
</P>
<P>
   Have the eyes and cannot see?
</P>
<P>
   Never country gained her freedom
</P>
<P>
   When she sued on bended knee.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Stewart Parnell became the champion of the landless
farmers and Catholics in the mid-1850s. In the 1890s, William
Butler Yeats and Maud Gonne sparked a revival of Irish literature
and culture. In 1902, Yeats and Lady Augusta Gregory wrote
``Cathleen ni Houlihan,'' a play that ``stirred nationalist
passions.''
</P>
<P>
   Those passions led to a new crop of freedom fighters _ Padraig
Pearse, James Larkin, Thomas Clark, James Connolly, Countess
Constance Markievicz, Thomas MacDonagh, Joseph Plunkett, Eamonn
Ceant, Sean MacDiarmadal, Michael Collins, Eamon de Valera, Roger
Casement. For their roles in the Easter Sunday uprising of 1916,
Pearse, Clark, MacDonagh, Plunkett, John MacBride and four others
were executed. In 1922, Collins was shot when he agreed to less
than full independence from Britain.
</P>
<P>
   As Northern Ireland became a battleground in the 1960s, new
leaders would emerge _ John Hume, Gerry Adams, Bernadette Devlin on
the Catholic side; Ian Paisley on the Protestant side.
</P>
<P>
   Golway provides a terrific look at Irish history. This is not
dull history, but a living, breathing look at how a nation evolved
over 1,000 years. And it is fairly impartial, a rarity when dealing
with anything Irish.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, one cannot say the same about William Magan's
``The Story of Ireland _ A History of an Ancient Family and Their
Country'' (Element Books, $19.95 paperback, 413 pages). Magan's
history up to about 1800 is OK. But he is so interested in trying
to prove how valuable his land-owning family has been to Ireland,
he gives short shift to historical events. He barely mentions the
potato famine, and dismisses the Easter uprising with two
sentences. This a book that never should have been published.
</P>
<P>
   For those interested in Irish legends, pick up ``The Raid _ A
Dramatic Retelling of Ireland's Epic Tale'' by Randy Lee Eickhoff
(Forge, $13.95 paperback, 267 pages).
</P>
<P>
   After lovemaking, Ailill, the king of Connacht, and his wife,
Maeve, argue over who is the wealthiest. Maeve insists that each of
their assets must be added up. All is even, until they add on a
magnificent bull owned by Ailill. When she discovers there is an
even better bull in Ulster, she declares war on Ulster and marches
out to retrieve the Brown Bull of Cooley.
</P>
<P>
   Because a curse has been placed on the men of Ulster, the only
person who can stop Maeve and Ailill is the boy warrior Cuchulain.
He is invincible and kills scores at a time. Month after month, he
fights alone, waiting for the curse on Ulster fighters to end.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Raid'' is a lusty and violent tale full of the intrigue
and over-the-top characters that every good epic should have.
</P>
<P>
   Another worthy addition to any Irish-lover's bookcase is ``The
Penguin Book of Irish Fiction'' edited by Colm Toibin (Viking, $40,
1073 pages). The first excerpt is from Jonathan Swift's
``Gulliver's Travels.'' Other entries include Anthony Trollope,
Bram Stoker, Oscar Wilde, James Joyce, Samuel Beckett, Neil Jordan,
Patrick McCabe, Roddy Doyle and many more.
</P>
<P>
   I have only skimmed through this weighty tome, but you know it
is one of those books that you'll pick up periodically and find
another author to enjoy.

The improvisational interplay of Thumbs Up members Ray Pizzi, left,
Carol Kaye and Mitch Holder is documented on a new live album. Phil
McCarten/Daily News 
 
 
By FRED SHUSTER 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Thumbs Up trio's high level of musicianship becomes evident
the moment you learn the 7 1/2-minute version of the jazz standard
``Green Dolphin Street,'' which opens the band's live album, was
improvised on the spot.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the drummerless trio _ Ray Pizzi (sax, flute), Mitch
Holder (guitar) and Carol Kaye (bass) _ have appeared on thousands
of records as session musicians. The three friends came together in
late 1998 to play a series of dates at two local clubs.
</P>
<P>
   The just-issued live album, ``Thumbs Up,'' documents those gigs
with a set of covers and originals touching on straight-ahead jazz,
blues, Latin and r&AMP;b.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were the first gigs we ever played together,'' offers
Pizzi. ``It's all about experience. Carol and Mitch have literally
done it all. They're well-rounded musicians who haven't let work
inhibit creativity. A lot of people who do record dates get so
busy, they forget the joy of making music. We all still have the
joy of playing. That's very important.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's no understatement. This group really has done it all.
Pizzi played and recorded with everyone from Dizzy Gillespie,
Horace Silver and Henry Mancini to John Williams and Frank Zappa. A
former member of the Johnny Carson-era ``Tonight Show'' orchestra,
Holder cut hits with Lionel Richie, Frank Sinatra, Barbra Streisand
and Dionne Warwick, along with scores of TV and film dates. Kaye is
known as the city's No. 1 studio bassist and has worked extensively
with Phil Spector, Brian Wilson, Lee Hazlewood and other top
producers.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the three of us play together, we know how to groove,''
Kaye said. ``We don't need a drummer to show us where the beat is.
It's a natural thing.''
</P>
<P>
   When Thumbs Up appeared at McCabe's and the Jazz Bakery for
three dates that resulted in the album, word spread, and a chorus
line of percussionists showed up, hoping to land a gig with the
high-profile trio.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact we don't use drums lets people hear a lot more of
what's going on musically,'' Holder said. ``When you have a band,
people tend to hear the melody above all, and the drums and rhythm
instruments become like a blanket. With our trio, you hear so much
more. It allows the listener to become more involved. It's not what
you play, it's what you leave out.''
</P>
<P>
   Among Holder's ongoing session jobs is as part of the ensemble
that scores TV's ``The Simpsons.'' It's one of the last TV shows
that uses actual musicians instead of synthesizers and samples, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   When not working sessions himself, Pizzi appears at 11 a.m.
Sundays at the Lighthouse in Hermosa Beach with the Bobby White
Quintet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a nice, relaxed date,'' Pizzi said. ``Straight-ahead jazz
standards.''
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Kaye was a mainstream jazz player when she began
guesting on rock 'n' roll dates in the late '50s, beginning with a
Sam Cooke session.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sam's music was so good, I didn't mind it,'' she said from her
Canyon Country home. ``It got to be a lot of rock dates after that.
But a lot of that stuff I didn't really like. Still, we all had
kids, and we were making a lot of dough.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaye, who turns 65 on March 24, recalled it was evident that
some of the pop sessions she played had lasting qualities. For
example, there was the Beach Boys' ``Pet Sounds,'' Brian Wilson's
1966 masterpiece, widely considered among the greatest pop albums
ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brian was a gas to work for,'' Kaye said. ``Frankly, all the
bass parts I played, he wrote. He wasn't like the other guys I
worked for back then. He wrote down the notes. The others would
sort of tell you what they needed, and you had to make up the
parts. It was obvious he was a genius early on. With him, you got
the idea the records would last forever. You knew the music would
live on.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaye said much of today's pop and rock lacks the ``sound and
feel of real music. Believe it or not, the tunes in the '60s were
not that much better. But we had to dress up the songs with our
playing. We were jazz players cutting rock 'n' roll. And we had to
keep that quiet because some of the young producers were
intimidated by jazz.''
</P>
<P>
   Like other top-flight session musicians of the era, Kaye was
uncredited on most of the albums she worked on. Especially when the
record company wanted the public to believe the band billed on the
record cover was performing its own music.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would take weeks and weeks for some of these groups to get
something good in the studio,'' Kaye said. ``We could cut a hit
album in six hours. The labels didn't want to advertise the fact
that studio players were involved. So, like on the surf records,
we'd cut 'em, and the record company would go out and hire some
cute guys to tour as the band.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with Thumbs Up (which will appear locally in the next few
months), Kaye teaches bass and does the occasional session, such as
one for the current Matthew Sweet disc.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was great fun,'' she said. ``We were trying to capture the
Phil Spector sound, and we actually got pretty close. There were
really nice vibes.''
</P>
<P>
   With the recent addition of a session musicians category to the
Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremonies, Kaye is optimistic
that architects of pop such as herself will begin getting the
recognition they've long deserved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not bragging, but I think it's important for kids to know
there were hard-working people who cut that music who weren't into
drugs,'' she said. ``I'd like young people to realize that being in
the music business can be a great profession even if you're not a
big star. You can make a very good living all your life through
music.
</P>
<P>
   ``And if you don't play, you can teach.'' &QL;

<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS)And the bride was beautiful in a strapless silk
A-line gown sparkling with crystal beads randomly stitched at the
bodice and accented with a diamond choker to match her tiara
...(END ITALICS)
</P>
<P>
   Notice there's no mention of traditional trappings such as a
fingertip veil, leg-of-mutton sleeve or Princess Diana-style train.
And pearls? They're retro enough to be in, but on their way out.
</P>
<P>
   New millennium brides are part `50s movie star, part prom queen
and totally dazzling with an opulence not seen since the `80s.
</P>
<P>
   But don't blind the guests with too much glitz.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's gowns are less ostentatious than we saw in the
`Dynasty' decade. The beading is more subtle and there's a lot less
fabric as gowns become more sophisticated to appeal to the growing
number of older brides,'' says Lisa Litt, owner of Lili Bridals in
Tarzana. According to Litt, who recently participated in a bridal
fair at Bloomingdale's in Sherman Oaks, the newest looks are
definitely sleeveless.
</P>
<P>
   Even spaghetti straps are looking limp.
</P>
<P>
   ``Strapless is the biggest news _ think of Marilyn Monroe and
Jane Russell in `Gentlemen Prefer Blondes' _ but in white and not
so tight. Make it an A-line silhouette or a ballgown with a fitted
waist similar to the one Audrey Hepburn wore in the final scene of
`Funny Face,' just as long as it's strapless,'' says Collene
Kennedy, design spokeswoman for David's Bridal stores.
</P>
<P>
   According to Kennedy, those strapless gowns are perfect for an
up-`do like Hepburn's, leaving the neckline a blank canvas that
needs some adornment, like those jewels seen on Oscar's red carpet.
And with it are dangling earrings and a tiara, which Kennedy calls
``head candy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Think regal ... like a Miss America crown, decorated with
traditional pearls, or newer combinations of pearls and crystals
that can be worn with detachable veils if you've got to have a
veil,'' she explains.
</P>
<P>
   Fans who worry they'd look SO last year in a tiara, needn't.
</P>
<P>
   Spring bridal magazines are advertising plenty of them. There's
even a Web site called TheTiara.com that's dedicated to couture
headpiece designs, while the new WeddingChannel.com Web site has
hairpins and other ornaments glittering with crystals.
</P>
<P>
   Now, if your heart is set on looking like Cinderella, bridal
experts say tulle still rules. That cloud of frothy tulle was the
inspiration of Vera Wang, but everybody's interpreted it. What
keeps it looking fresh is a corsetted bodice _ strapless or with
spaghetti straps _ and maybe a lace-up back like the one Scarlett
O'Hara squeezed into. And to make it really fashion-forward, choose
a two-piece ensemble.
</P>
<P>
   Another edgy look for modern brides is crystal-beaded pants,
worn with a tank top. It's the alternative choice for the bride who
would have worn a miniskirt a few years ago. And according to Litt,
it's great for weddings on the beach.
</P>
<P>
   For the wedding party, black-and-white themes are still in
because nobody wants their bridesmaid dress to look like a
bridesmaid dress. But Litt and Kennedy say the black dresses will
look fresher with a little white trim.
</P>
<P>
   Iridescent green is a popular bridesmaid choice at Lili Bridals,
and blues and lavender are hot at David's Bridal stores, but
champagne, and ballet pink are best sellers at the Victorian Garden
in Sherman Oaks. But owner Patti Scalero stresses that this isn't
cotton candy pink like the gown Gwyneth Paltrow wore to the Oscars
last year. Nor are there any sweetly puffed sleeves.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, strapless is the word in aisle attire. &QL;

&HT;     MARTHA STEWART CAN PAINT THE RED PLANET GREEN

   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Houston, we have a problem, but I know just the
person who can solve it. Ask Martha.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps you heard that NASA scientists have discovered a scary
threat to the astronauts who will eventually embark on the space
agency's two-year mission to Mars.
</P>
<P>
   Because there is no way to pack a spacecraft with enough
prepared food to last two years, the crew will have to grow,
process and cook much of its food. The threat:
</P>
<P>
   Processing and cooking the kinds of raw plant products the crew
will grow _ rice, soya, grains _ release something called
``volatile organic compounds,'' or VOCs.
</P>
<P>
   In a regular kitchen or even a Winnebago, VOCs are
inconsequential. You just open a window or turn on the exhaust fan.
But spaceships have no exhaust system; VOCs will build up and cause
major irritation of eyes, mucous membranes and (yikes) genitalia.
</P>
<P>
   If it took only a few months to get to Mars, everybody could
bite the bullet. Russian and American astronauts already proved
this last year when the Mir space station deteriorated into a
semi-slum.
</P>
<P>
   But two years is way too long for working scientists _ or
anybody, for that matter _ to endure perpetually inflamed eyes,
noses, mouths and private parts.
</P>
<P>
   What to do?
</P>
<P>
   As I said, ask Martha Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, why not sign her up as a crew member and take her
along?
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to living conditions, Martha knows everything
about how to make them better, and more beautiful. Or if she
doesn't know, she'll dig away and soon find a solution. She is the
queen of habitat problem-solving.
</P>
<P>
   The best minds at NASA may be stumped about VOC build-up and
alternatives to growing and cooking food onboard a spaceship. But,
as anyone knows who has read Martha Stewart's magazine, browsed her
Web site, watched her TV show or listened to her daily ``Ask
Martha'' radio program, NOTHING stumps her.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the task is fashioning little bags of candy confetti out
of tulle or winterizing a lawn mower and properly storing it in the
garage, Martha knows the best way.
</P>
<P>
   Why would her problem-solving prowess stop at Earth's
atmosphere?
</P>
<P>
   Just picture Martha up there in Star Trek country, pacing the
spaceship, hands on hips. She surveys every piece of hardware,
every design element, every curve and plane. No matter where she
stops, no matter what she looks under or behind, she smiles gently
and announces, ``We can do better than this!''
</P>
<P>
   Really, this is a win-win prospect for everyone. NASA will get
its VOC glitch solved (long before the spacecraft blasts off for
Mars) and the addition of Martha to the crew should alleviate most
of the mission's other potential problems.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, according to the London Independent, the Mars
flight is expected to be ``one of the most unpleasant that anyone
could experience. Psychologists have already likened it to being
stuck in the Antarctic winter, with no option of going outside.''
</P>
<P>
   Games like chess will be verboten because they might foster
hostile, uncooperative vibes.
</P>
<P>
   ``And, as for sex, there is still no evidence that it is
feasible in space, even if the crew members wanted to.''
</P>
<P>
   Not feasible? Where there's a will, Martha Stewart finds a way.
And the sex would be beautiful, gracious AND functional.
</P>
<P>
   She would also dream up fabulous games and activities that build
team spirit. And, if NASA gives her a decent decorating allowance,
crew members wouldn't think they're in Antarctica, but in a condo
complex in Key West.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of us will win, too. For two full years, no matter how
easy or simple Martha tells us a project will be, we won't have to
feel guilty, stupid or slothful for not doing it.
</P>
<P>
   After all, she will be in a spaceship headed for Mars. Even
Martha Stewart can't make us believe that is a world within our
reach.

JAPAN COULD USE A THATCHER-LIKE THRASHING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Japanese stock market took a dive early this week when the
Japanese government announced that the country's economy had once
more fallen into recession.
</P>
<P>
   For investors, this was a case of deja vu all over again. Since
1992 the Japanese economy has regularly threatened to break out of
its slump only to sink back into the mire.
</P>
<P>
   Here's our advice to investors: The time to get excited about
Japan is when you see a Japanese politician come to power who
reminds you of Margaret Thatcher.
</P>
<P>
   No, it doesn't have to be a woman. Nor would she have to start a
war in a remote part of the world. We are talking about Margaret
Thatcher, the free-market radical, the Margaret Thatcher who said
quite bluntly that the old system wasn't working and that it needed
to be junked, not just fine-tuned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is a feeling in Japan that the system that
worked so well is quite dysfunctional and needs a thorough
shaking,'' said Daniel Yergin, chairman of Cambridge Energy
Research Associates.
</P>
<P>
   Yergin is a good person to ask about parallels between Japan and
Mrs. Thatcher's Great Britain. In 1998 Yergin and a colleague wrote
``The Commanding Heights,'' a book about the triumph of market
economies around the world.
</P>
<P>
   The best chapter in the book is the story of Thatcher and her
intellectual mentor, Keith Joseph. The Britain they confronted in
the 1970s was an economic disaster area. Unemployment was high. So
was inflation. And there was a widespread feeling that the country
was on a permanent path of decline.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you imagine _ people accepting decline?'' Thatcher told
Yergin.
</P>
<P>
   Thatcher concluded the problem was too much government
involvement in the economy. Joseph put it simply when he said, ``We
are over-governed, over-spent, over-taxed, over-borrowed, and
over-manned.'' The two also decided that the classic Keynesian
remedy, government deficit spending, wasn't going to fix things.
</P>
<P>
   What was needed was nothing less than an overhaul of the
country's political and economic culture. Over a period of years
Thatcher tangled with labor unions and privatized many of Britain's
leading industries. She made plenty of enemies and mistakes along
the way.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in the end, most people in Britain, even her political
rivals, conceded that the country badly needed the cage-rattling
that Thatcher administered.
</P>
<P>
   Like Britain in the 1970s, Japan in the year 2000 is confronting
the prospect of permanent decline.
</P>
<P>
   The country's economy has barely grown since 1992. Once a
technological leader, Japan these days is playing catch-up in many
industries. Consumers refuse to spend money. The stock market has
rallied, but without much conviction.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's budget deficit has ballooned because the government
keeps spending money on massive public works projects that don't
seem to do much good.
</P>
<P>
   To many economists, the Japanese government is still part of the
problem, rather than the solution. ``Japan still has a
command-and-control economy,'' said Mark Zandi, chief economist at
RFA Dismal Sciences, a Pennsylvania forecasting firm. ``When it
comes to deregulation, they are at least a decade behind the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   Japan has made changes, particularly in the financial sector,
but Japan-watchers say the moves amount to baby steps when giant
steps are required. Maureen Allyn, chief economist at Scudder
Kemper Investments, complains that some of the government's
spending programs have propped up politically connected failing
companies. ``There is still too much of an attitude that says: `We
will protect you from change,' '' said Allyn.
</P>
<P>
   In most countries, a decade of rotten economic performance would
have spelled trouble for the ruling political party. In this
country, the rascals would have been tossed out long ago.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, however, the Liberal Democratic Party has managed to
cling to power. ``There doesn't seem to be enough sense of crisis
yet,'' said Nariman Behravesh, chief international economist at
Standard &AMP; Poor's DRI.
</P>
<P>
   Yergin is among those who see some glimmers of hope. He points
out that there are signs of life in some of Japan's leading-edge
companies. Young people are demanding change. Small stocks have
outperformed big ones because they are more attuned to the world's
new economy. ``Below the surface you have a lot of innovation going
on,'' said Yergin.
</P>
<P>
   He may be right. But we are not convinced yet. In fact, we are
keeping our money on the sidelines until we see that Japanese Mrs.
Thatcher make her appearance. We want to hear a Japanese leader
declare as Thatcher once did: ``I am the rebel head of the
establishment government.''
</P>
<P>
   When that day comes, we'll issue our ``buy'' recommendation for
the Japanese stock market.

SEEKING SECURITY IN CYBERSPACE 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA F. MELTZ  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   At one extreme, there's the fun stuff, like the private language
our 12-year-olds use with friends in instant messages:
</P>
<P>
   ``sup?''
</P>
<P>
   ``nm. u?''
</P>
<P>
   ``hw.''
</P>
<P>
   ``haha, lol . . . j/k.''
</P>
<P>
   ``pos, ctgr.''
</P>
<P>
   ``l8er.''
</P>
<P>
   At the other end of the spectrum, there's peril: Late last
month, a 29-year-old Massachusetts man was charged with breaking
into a house and attempting to rape a 14-year-old girl he had met
on line in a chat room and corresponded with via e-mail for about a
year. According to police, he posed as an 18-year-old and may also
have contacted 20 or more other girls. Police also say the girl had
willingly met him off line several times.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, the space between the two extremes is not the chasm we
might hope for.
</P>
<P>
   With all the positives we know children can get out of
cybercommunication, most of us think of our kids' e-mail and buddy
chats as innocuous or, at most, a hindrance to homework. But the
chilling Whitman arrest highlights not only how vulnerable our
children are but also how they put themselves at risk.
</P>
<P>
   Why are our kids so attracted to cybertalk to begin with?
</P>
<P>
   ``For the same reason I used to come home from school and get on
the phone with the friends I had just left,'' says children's
culture specialist Kathy Merlock Jackson, a professor at Virginia
Wesleyan College. At this age, she says, there's a deep, powerful
need to connect to peers, ``but in this day and age it's the
computer that comes naturally to kids instead of the phone.''
</P>
<P>
   That need begins to surface at about 10 and peaks from about 13
to 16. E-mail (one-to-one conversation) and instant ``buddy''
messages (instantaneous e-mail to a specified group of users) are
more popular than chats (public conversations, often with strangers
who share a common interest), but a staggering number of children,
about 12 million, engage in some kind of cybertalk, says
cybersafety specialist Parry Aftab.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Better than the telephone
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At a stage in life when independence and privacy are paramount,
cybertalk has much more to offer than the telephone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents can't overhear you,'' says Jackson. ``They're less
likely to know how long you're on or who you're talking to. Even if
they pay attention, they don't know what you're saying because of
the `secret' language.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that anything of substance ever gets said anyway. ``The
point of it is the connection, not the content,'' says Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   The advantages for shy or socially awkward children are even
greater. ``On line, there's no one judging them,'' says Pittsburgh
psychologist Kimberly Young. ``That frees them to express
themselves in ways they can't in person. Kids who are misfits in
school suddenly feel they belong.'' Young is executive director of
the Center for On-Line Addiction (www.netaddiction.com) and the
author of ``Caught in the Net'' (Wiley and Sons).
</P>
<P>
   But cybertalk does have negatives:
</P>
<P>
   --It creates a culture of detachment. At a time in life when
teens should be honing interpersonal skills, they withdraw from
real life by spending time on the computer. If anything, says
Jackson, ``The child who's shy in person only becomes more so.''
</P>
<P>
   --It's easy to misread. Because there's no tonal quality to
e-talk, it's easy for a child to take offense where none was
intended. This translates to real-life hurt feelings, even broken
friendships. Younger children are especially prone.
</P>
<P>
   --It's easy to pretend. What begins as newfound freedom to
express yourself often turns into trying on a new persona: A timid
boy plays with being a threatening, macho type; a 14-year-old girl
who's overweight tries out being sexually provocative. ``It's easy
to get caught up with it,'' says Young.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Chat room ``lurkers''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The danger is that provocative words and content draw attention.
Chats are notorious for attracting ``lurkers,'' people who listen
in rather than participate and contact a person privately
afterward, through e-mail. Their goal, says Aftab, can range from
sending kids pornographic material or initiating cybersex (sexual
talk about what you would do if you were there in person) to
meeting off line. A typical lure: ``I just got the new Sony
PlayStation! I bet my uncle can get it for you, too!'' Aftab is
executive director of Cyberangels, a national Internet safety
organization safety group (cyberangels.org). She also is the author
of a must-read book, ``The Parent's Guide to Protecting Your
Children in Cyberspace'' (McGraw Hill).
</P>
<P>
   --It's easy to feel safe. Teens tend to feel impervious to
danger. ``They take risks on line because they don't see them as
risks,'' says Aftab. In an online survey of 11,000 girls aged 13 to
16, 60 percent said they engage in cybersex even though they said
they wouldn't have real sex until they are married. Similarly, once
a 14-year-old chats and then exchanges e-mail for months with a
stranger, the person no longer is a stranger. ``He was a friend,''
the Whitman teen reportedly told police.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't occur to a teen that the person isn't who and what
he says he is,'' says Aftab.
</P>
<P>
   This is, of course, what's so frightening. According to Aftab,
12 to 13 percent of preteens who engage in cybertalk agree to meet
off line someone they have met on line. Children most likely to do
this: middle-class suburban kids. ``They're naive and trusting,''
she says. ``Urban kids are far more likely to know it's a stupid
idea.'' Since 1995, the FBI has arrested 515 people accused of
trying to arrange offline meetings with children, and last year it
opened 1,500 new cases, double the number from 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Good news for parents
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The good news in all of this is that we are not as powerless as
we may think in keeping our children safe. Perhaps most important,
says Aftab, is making sure your children understand that people
they don't want to get in touch with them are able to trace them if
they: fill out any online personal profiles; answer junk e-mail;
divulge personal information in an e-mail or chat room. Since this
may frighten some younger children, stress the junk advertising
piece of it: ``You know how we get so many annoying catalogs in the
mail? Well, there's junk e-mail, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Basic safety rules also are important: The computer belongs in a
public space in the house; no Internet surfing except for school
research and/or with a parent present; instant messaging only with
people you know directly off line, that is, not with friends of
friends; chatting only in agreed-to chats.
</P>
<P>
   Once you've established these rules, says Aftab, create a
contract for you and your child to sign; the younger he is when you
do this, the safer he will be when he's older. Here are basic items
to include:

PRICELINE BRANCHES OUT INTO GROCERIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Priceline.com, the Web company known for its name-your-own-price
airline tickets and offbeat ads featuring ``Star Trek's'' William
Shatner, is about to extend its grocery business through an
alliance with the Stop &AMP; Shop Supermarket Co.
</P>
<P>
   Starting Sunday, Priceline WebHouse Club, a private affiliate of
Priceline.com Inc., plans to offer consumers similar
name-your-own-price deals on everything from TV dinners to tuna
fish and tortilla chips.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, the way consumers would place bids on a Web
site, then pick up their groceries in a brick-and-mortar Stop &AMP;
Shop, might seem complex and confusing.
</P>
<P>
   But that hasn't slowed down New Yorkers. Since first offering
its grocery service in the metropolitan New York market in
November, close to 300,000 consumers have applied for WebHouse
membership cards.
</P>
<P>
   ``In tough, tough New York, 4 percent of the population signed
up in less than two months,'' said Harry E. Wells, an analyst with
Adams Harkness &AMP; Hill in Boston. ``I didn't think you could get 4
percent of New Yorkers to sign up for free $2 bills.''
</P>
<P>
   Webhouse isn't stopping with groceries. In May, it plans to
apply the name-your-own-price philosophy to gasoline. And down the
road, who knows? Maybe prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   WebHouse of Stamford, Conn., is not to be confused with online
grocers such as HomeRuns.com, Streamline.com, or ShopLink.com,
where customers order groceries online and then get home delivery.
In theory, a customer of one of these services never needs to visit
a brick-and-mortar supermarket again. These outfits use the
Internet to offer convenience.
</P>
<P>
   WebHouse has a different strategy. Instead of convenience, it
uses the Internet to offer discounts and value, said Jay S. Walker,
founder of both Webhouse and Priceline.com.
</P>
<P>
   At a special place on Priceline.com's Web site, consumers make
offers on groceries, much as they might bid on airline tickets from
the company. If their grocery prices are accepted, consumers next
go to a Stop &AMP; Shop, pick the items off store shelves, and take
their shopping carts through a checkout line.
</P>
<P>
   In return for their extra time and effort, WebHouse customers
are rewarded with average savings of about $13 on a $35 order,
Walker said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our customer is anyone who wants to save $10 to $20 a week on
groceries,'' said Walker, adding that a value-conscious consumer
who is fond of using coupons or shopping at a BJ's Wholesale Club
should like WebHouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great deal for our customers,'' said Debbie
Principi, Stop &AMP; Shop's technology support project manager.
</P>
<P>
   Stop &AMP; Shop, a 202-store chain based in Quincy, Mass., is one of
several supermarket chains to team up with WebHouse in the New York
market. A ``positive'' initial response from customers persuaded
Stop &AMP; Shop to offer the WebHouse service to customers in
Connecticut, Western Massachusetts, and Greater Boston, she said.
WebHouse is also available in Baltimore, Detroit, Philadelphia, and
Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how WebHouse is supposed to work in this market: At the
Priceline.com Web site or a Stop &AMP; Shop store, consumers can sign
up for a WebHouse membership card that's linked to a Visa or
Mastercard credit card or debit card. Consumers get a free 90-day
trial period. After that, there can be a $3 monthly fee for using
the service.
</P>
<P>
   Once they have been issued a WebHouse card, consumers are ready
to shop online in the grocery section of Priceline.com's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Suppose a customer wants to buy a box of raisin bran. On one
page of the Web site Wednesday, three brands were displayed _
Kellogg's, Post, and Total.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, a box of this cereal would sell for about $2.99,
WebHouse claims. Consumers are then offered four possible price
choices. They can bid to pay $2.66, $2.48, $2.33, or $2.18 for the
cereal. Or they can offer a different price.
</P>
<P>
   The lower the bid, the less likely it will be accepted. But if a
consumer opts to pay $2.66 for a $2.99 box of cereal, there is an
85 percent chance the offer will be accepted, WebHouse said.
</P>
<P>
   If the Internet is functioning smoothly, consumers should learn
within 60 seconds whether their offer has been accepted.
</P>
<P>
   Now here's something consumers need to know: The very instant a
shopper's offer on a product is accepted, the price is
automatically billed to his credit or debit card.
</P>
<P>
   There's something else consumers need to know. If their price
offer is accepted, WebHouse dictates which of the three brands of
raisin bran they have to buy.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be brand flexible,'' Walker says.
</P>
<P>
   Suppose a local consumer goes to the Priceline Web site with a
grocery list of 20 items, and 15 price offers are accepted. The
consumer then gets a printout of accepted items for his or her next
trip to a Stop &AMP; Shop.
</P>
<P>
   At the store, consumers pick up the items on their lists.
However, if they decide to buy additional products, they must keep
them separate from WebHouse items in their shopping carts.
</P>
<P>
   At the cash register, consumers swipe their WebHouse cards
through a scanner much as they would an ATM card. Items not on
their WebHouse list have to be paid for separately.
</P>
<P>
   To prevent hoarding, there are limits on the quantity of items a
consumer can buy at one time.
</P>
<P>
   WebHouse claims to list on its Web site about 800 brands of
packaged goods found at supermarkets. There's also a limited
selection of perishable items, meat, and fish.
</P>
<P>
   Because WebHouse reimburses supermarkets for the difference
between the price paid by consumers and the item's shelf price,
Webhouse is a good deal for participating supermarket chains.
</P>
<P>
   With discounts, WebHouse can lure more customers into the
supermarkets, and supermarkets can better compete with a BJ's and
other discount warehouse clubs, analyst Wells said. WebHouse is a
``win-win'' for both supermarkets and consumers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, WebHouse members can pick up groceries at several
supermarket chains. It's possible that WebHouse will soon have
agreements with additional supermarket chains in the Greater Boston
market.
</P>
<P>
   How does WebHouse make money on its grocery business? In a
couple of ways. One is by taking a slice of the $5 billion a year
that consumer-products companies spend on coupon redemptions and
free samples.
</P>
<P>
   For confidentiality reasons, WebHouse won't reveal which
consumer-product companies are its clients. But suppose a cereal
company is looking to grow its market share. One way it can do that
is by paying WebHouse a fee to ensure that its raisin bran finds
its way into the shopping carts of WebHouse customers.
</P>
<P>
   Part of that fee from the consumer-products company goes toward
reimbursing the supermarkets at which WebHouse customers pick up
their discounted groceries. And part of that fee goes into
WebHouse's pocket.
</P>
<P>
   WebHouse also runs promotions on its Web site. For giving a
magazine a free trial or for signing up for a Discover card,
WebHouse members can qualify for ``tokens'' that can be redeemed
for even bigger discounts on grocery items.
</P>
<P>
   For this form of advertising, the magazine publisher and the
credit card company would pay WebHouse a fee.
</P>
<P>
   Walker stressed WebHouse and Priceline are not auctions. An
auction, he said, is a competition between two or more bidders.
</P>
<P>
   ``At WebHouse, you're making an offer on price,'' he said. ``But
you're not competing against someone else. With this system,
everyone can win.''

FUTURISTIC X-COMMUNITY TAKES ITS PLACE IN THE PRESENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SIMSON L. GARFINKLE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Five years ago, my wife and I wrote a novel about an Internet
start-up that created a multimedia groupware system for UNIX-based
computers. The company was called Deus Ex Machina Software. The
product, called ExCommunicate, was designed to let people in
different offices work together on large projects. They could
simultaneously edit different parts of the same document, insert
spreadsheets and multimedia presentations, create task lists, leave
messages for each other, and even teleconference.
</P>
<P>
   You can imagine my surprise when X-Collaboration Software Corp.,
a Boston Internet startup, began advertising its software on public
radio last fall. Intrigued, I contacted the firm and learned that
the company's new X-Community service, announced on Monday, was
astonishingly close to the ExCommunicate software that my wife and
I had envisioned.
</P>
<P>
   The X-Community system is designed to let many people work on
the same project at the same time. You can create a 500-page report
and let different people edit different sections at the same time.
You can work on the document from anywhere in the world that has an
Internet connection _ your documents are stored on the X-Community
server.
</P>
<P>
   Information on the X-Community system is divided into different
``Workspaces,'' each of which contains multiple ``Whiteboards.'' On
each Whiteboard you can store as many ``Note cards'' as you wish. A
Note card can be a Microsoft Word document, a PowerPoint
presentation, a spreadsheet, images, sound clips, or just about
anything else.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other collaborative work systems that I've seen,
X-Community understands Word's file format, allowing the system to
take a document with headings and subheadings and display the
document's outline on a Web page. People on your team even can
check out paragraphs for editing while the rest of the document
remains available on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   A particularly innovative feature of X-Community is that you can
copy the structure of a Workspace without copying the data that it
contains. Kevin Lo, X-Collaboration's founder, calls this
``knowledge management.'' For example, he says, a consulting firm
could develop a 68-step procedure for doing an audit of an Internet
business. That audit could include questionnaires, spreadsheets,
and even photographs that had to be taken on-site. The consulting
firm then could clone the structure of the audit Whiteboard and end
up with a blank template for conducting more audits in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Much of what X-Community does falls under the category of
document management. Although law firms and consulting companies
have used document management systems for years, the vast majority
of these systems are based on local area computer networks. Even
the fictional software that I created back in 1995 ran on a LAN.
</P>
<P>
   X-Collaborate, on the other hand, is Web based. The service is
delivered through a combination of software running on the
X-Community Web site and a browser plug-in that runs on your
Windows PC. It's this plug-in that takes care of the
behind-the-scenes magic of automatically downloading the files to
your local computer when you need them, then saving the files back
to X-Community when you are done. Naturally, you can control who
within your organization has what kind of access to which files
stored on the server.
</P>
<P>
   Designed for hectic work environments, X-Community lets you
track multiple versions of documents, access backup files, and
annotate documents with comments. You can assign tasks to
particular individuals and monitor when they are completed. And you
can take a snapshot of the project as it exists on a particular day
and archive it for future reference.
</P>
<P>
   There are advantages and disadvantages to a Web-based document
management system. The big advantage is that it frees X-Community's
corporate customers from the hassles of running their own software,
keeping that software up to date, and backing up the user's data.
Even taking into account the cost of the X-Community, Web-based
services can be dramatically cheaper for most businesses than
running the same services for themselves in-house.
</P>
<P>
   The disadvantage arises from the corresponding lack of control
that comes when you hand over control of your company's documents
to an outside provider. If the Internet is down, then a company
that depends upon X-Community will find itself unable to work. And
storing your documents off-site increases the chances that they
might leak into a competitor's hands.
</P>
<P>
   The folks at X-Collaboration Software seem to understand these
sorts of data custodian issues. Unlike many Internet startups its
size, the company has an individual in charge of enforcing both the
company's security and privacy policies. The system uses high-grade
encryption for sending documents over the Internet, as well as for
storing them on the company's servers. And X-Collaboration has
taken measures so that only a few people inside the company have
access to customer data.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there are problems with X-Collaboration. For starters, even
though it is Web-based, it really only works for people who use
Windows-based PCs. If you have a Mac or a Linux computer you can
browse a Workspace or Whiteboard, but you can't actually edit the
documents themselves. A second problem is that right now,
X-Community's search feature only looks at the titles and search
tags of a document.
</P>
<P>
   Pricing for X-Community is very reasonable: a 10-user license
that includes 100 megabytes of storage is $100 per month. There is
also a free version of the service that allows individuals to store
up to 25 megabytes of information on X-Community's servers, as well
as access Workspaces belonging to other customers.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, I like X-Community. It's not as cool as my fictional
ExCommunicate program, but on the other hand, it's real and
available today. You can find out more at www.x-community.com.

<P>
   The kitchen in the house that Walter Gropius designed for
himself and his family in Lincoln, Mass. in 1937 was a statement of
the Bauhaus style, transported to and translated for New England,
after the great architect fled Nazi Germany and arrived to teach at
Harvard. Ultramodern though the house was, there was still a maid's
room attached to the kitchen, and a pantry that was the maid's
staging area, blocked off from the dining room by a sliding gray
plastic shower curtain.
</P>
<P>
   The kitchen in the house that Frank Lloyd Wright designed for
Isadore and Lucille Zimmerman in Manchester, N.H. in 1950 made no
accommodation for servants. During the war, maids had morphed into
Rosie the Riveter, and after, there was no going back to mopping up
other people's messes. The Zimmermans were privacy-oriented people
anyway, who didn't want hired help even for parties. But what their
kitchen did boast was a huge _ for its day _ freezer chest, where
they stashed party food they cooked ahead of time.
</P>
<P>
   The kitchen of today is a place where bigger is better, where
it's desirable to have a granite island the size of a small
country, maybe a walk-in fireplace with a spit for roasting
venison, possibly an art collection and SurroundSound, an antique
table and collection of deliberately mismatched chairs, and
gadgetry that spends your time rather than saving it: machines for
making bread, ice cream, cappuccino. A Biedermeier sofa in your
kitchen might get you a write-up in a shelter magazine. The kitchen
of 2000 has become a place to linger.
</P>
<P>
   The kitchens in the Gropius and Zimmerman houses were designed
to get out of. They were small and corridor-shaped, to save steps.
Time-saving appliances were the watchword in both, efficiency the
goal. Both Gropius and Wright would have enjoyed the recent Rhode
Island School of Design project ``The Universal Kitchen,'' which
set out to create a kitchen that's a kit of parts that can be
assembled to accommodate people of all ages and abilities, and
minimize movement. In the average American kitchen, RISD designers
found, it takes more than 400 steps to turn out a simple spaghetti
dinner. They developed a floor plan that requires fewer than 100.
Gropius and Wright would have loved that.
</P>
<P>
   There were also striking differences in the kitchen designs of
these two 20th-century titans _ more in style than in philosophy,
though. Gropius's palette was black, white, and silver; Wright's,
terra cotta and natural wood tones. So the Gropius and Zimmerman
kitchens look quite different: the former, sleek and lab-like; the
latter, earthy. But both architects wanted to blend indoors and
out, with as much natural light as possible in the kitchen and
accommodation for dining outside whenever the New England climate
permitted.
</P>
<P>
   And both were on a strict budget. The architects may have been
grand personas, but these particular houses were hardly grandiose:
The Zimmermans' is 1,700 square feet; the Gropius house, 2,300.
Gropius's daughter, Ati Gropius Johansen, still refers to the home
her father built on a $20,000 budget as ``an econobox.'' The
Zimmermans' house, which was supposed to cost $35,000, ended up at
close to $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   Neither was a starter home; both were built for couples in
middle age who knew what they wanted. It's testament to the
practicality of these houses _ and their meticulously thought-out
kitchens _ that the Gropiuses and Zimmermans lived in their
respective residences for more than 30 years, literally until their
death.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for architecture lovers, both houses are now in the
care of public institutions that offer regular tours: The
Zimmermans bequeathed their house to the Currier Gallery of Art in
Manchester; Gropius's widow, Ise, donated the family house to the
Society for the Preservation of New England Antiquities. The
Zimmerman house has been open since 1990; the Gropius house, since
1985. But only recently has the Gropius kitchen become part of the
tour, making a comparison possible.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The ``sugar cube on the hill'' is the derogatory nickname
neighbors gave the house Gropius built for himself, Ise, and Ati.
The Gropius house rises assertively from its regal, isolated knoll
in Lincoln, a plot granted by philanthropist Helen Storrow. She
gave several architects the use of adjacent parcels of land,
including Marcel Breuer, another key Bauhaus figure, who designed
some of the furniture in the Gropius house. From Gropius's living
room windows, you can see Breuer's house down the hill.
</P>
<P>
   Gropius, says SPNEA director of interpretation and public
programs Peter Gittleman, ``wanted to come to grips with nature by
making the architecture a contrast with it,'' the opposite of
Wright's idea of blending houses into their surroundings. Gropius
used rectilinearity and a stark, monochromatic palette to set off
natural forms.
</P>
<P>
   The way the Gropiuses ate and entertained helped determine the
design of their kitchen and its relation to the rest of the house.
Gittleman says that Ati Gropius Johansen contends that her mother
invented nouvelle cuisine _ minimal portions of minimalist food.
``A typical dinner would be a good piece of fish, five beans, and a
couple of tomatoes,'' says Gittleman. ``Ati told me her mother
would have objected to The New York Times having a whole section
devoted to food. Excess food seemed Victorian to the Gropiuses. If
you were a guest, you might have a small second helping, but that
was it.''
</P>
<P>
   There weren't many dinner guests at any one time. The white
laminate dining table, set with black and white dishes, Japanese
ceramic soup spoons, and never a tablecloth, sat four to six
people, under a recessed pinpoint fixture that created a pool of
light on the table. The novel lighting created an exquisite play of
shadows and tended to unite the diners in conversation. ``The talk
was about serious subjects,'' says Gittleman, ``not about food.''
The chairs are tubular steel, covered in plain white cloth. The
sideboard seems to grow out of a curving glass brick wall that
filtered light from the foyer into the dining space. Made of black
Caffelite, a laminate the Gropiuses discovered in a New York oyster
bar, the sideboard is sleek and asymmetrical. From here, the
Gropiuses would serve the main course after the starter had been
cleared by the maid.
</P>
<P>
   The maid took the dirty dishes to the sink in the pantry, where
the dishwasher was installed. She could have put them in the
dishwasher _ but didn't. ``She never used it,'' says Gittleman.
``She thought it might explode.'' She also never used the garbage
disposal, another newfangled, suspect gadget that she felt might
blow up in her face. The positioning of the disposal will strike
modern viewers as weird. It's at the far end of the kitchen,
nowhere near the dishwasher or the sink where dirty dishes were
washed. ``That's because the disposal was for food preparation,''
says Gittleman. ``With such small portions, there weren't supposed
to be any leftovers to dispose of.''
</P>
<P>
   Both dishwasher and disposal were gifts from General Electric.
In return, GE was allowed to use the Gropius house in ads that
promoted the idea of modern people using modern machines, a
principle tenet of the Bauhaus but not one that had caught on
universally in America, as the reaction of the Gropius's American
maid attests. The Gropiuses developed brand loyalty: Both their
white range and refrigerator are also GE.
</P>
<P>
   Every labor-saving device then invented was represented in the
Gropius kitchen, including an early blender and electric mixer.
SPNEA has outfitted the kitchen, mostly with the original pots,
pans, and measuring spoons, to present it just as it was in the
late 1960s, when the architect last lived there. Accessibility was
key to the way he wanted the kitchen to function: Covering part of
one kitchen window, where you can't miss it, is a white pegboard on
which hang ladles, graters, strainers, and other utensils, so the
cook didn't have to fish through drawers for them.

   The cook changed during the war. When the maid left, Ise Gropius
took over. ``This was meant as a one-person kitchen,'' Gittleman
says, ``and when Gropius was in here with her, he had to sit on a
stool to keep out of the way. Two people can't function at the same
time in here.''
</P>
<P>
   Both kitchen and pantry are studies in black and white. While
Gropius's contractors persuaded him to use cork floors in other
parts of the house, because cork hid dirt and was easy on the feet,
the architect insisted on black linoleum for the kitchen and pantry
floors _ even though the material showed every footprint.
Countertops, too, are black, while the cabinets are stock
laboratory models in white enamel, with striated Art Deco handles
jazzing them up. To assess the radicalness of this design, consider
that it was only in the 1930s that the continuous wall of kitchen
cabinets, as opposed to individual pieces of furniture, came into
general use.
</P>
<P>
   There's something of the science lab inside those cabinets, too:
glass petri dishes in several sizes, the small ones used as
ashtrays, the larger ones as salad dishes. ``Gropius loved
ordinary, modern, mass-produced things that were well designed,''
says Gittleman. It may come as a surprise, therefore, to see
bone-handled fish knives, shell-patterned sterling, and gold-rimmed
wine goblets in the same cabinets. ``They were family heirlooms
that he couldn't bear to leave behind in Germany,'' Gittleman
explains. ``But he never actually would have used them.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Frank Lloyd Wright didn't call it a ``kitchen.'' It was a
``workspace.'' You didn't mess much with the dictates of the
autocratic architect, so ``workspace'' it was to Isadore and
Lucille Zimmerman, who moved into their Wright-designed New
Hampshire house in 1952, two years after they'd commissioned it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their dream,'' says Zimmerman House site administrator Hetty
Startup, ``was a house that was easy to take care of, where they
could stay until they died.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``workspace'' also served as laundry and utility room,
uniting all the house's backstage functions in one place, all right
around the corner from the hearth that Wright considered the heart
of the home.
</P>
<P>
   A Wright ``workspace'' of a half-century ago was a place to get
the job done as fast as possible. Lucille Zimmerman made her Jell-O
mold and tuna casserole and that was that. The Zimmermans consumed
said casserole not in the kitchen, where there wasn't room for a
table, but in the ``dining loggia,'' as Wright called it, around
the corner. The dining table Wright designed comes apart and has
various configurations, including a hexagonal one: Wright sent
Lucille Zimmerman patterns for coordinating hexagonal table linens
to sew. Cooking and cleaning up were made more efficient by the
corridor shape of the kitchen: 26 feet long but just 8 feet wide,
with no great distances to travel from one appliance to another.
</P>
<P>
   Practicality was the goal, especially in the modestly priced and
scaled ``Usonian'' houses like the Zimmermans', which Wright
started designing during the Depression. In these houses, kitchens
were often placed on the inside, away from exterior walls; natural
light came from clerestory windows and skylights. Wright also wrote
that it was desirable to ``make the kitchen tall so cooking odors
can rise.''
</P>
<P>
   The Zimmermans _ he was a doctor, she was his nurse _ were
living in a 13-room Colonial Revival house they disliked when,
after researching in their local public library, they got up the
nerve to write to Wright. To their surprise, he wrote back. The
commission was underway. (They kept Wright happy with regular
shipments of the New Hampshire maple syrup he liked.) The
Zimmermans were the very definition of deference _ perfect Wright
clients, in other words. ``In listing below some utilitarian items
for your consideration,'' Isadore Zimmerman wrote to the architect,
``we are keenly sensitive that (itals)nothing should be allowed to
interfere in any way with your architectural creation.''(unitals)
</P>
<P>
   Among their requests: stainless steel appliances to avoid the
glare of white; an extra sink for handwashing. (They compromised on
the white issue.) Eventually, they'd also get an electric mixer,
dishwasher, pressure cooker, electric griddle, waffle maker, and
toaster, all plugged into strips of electrical outlets along the
counters. Right above is a long shelf for pot lids: Wright believed
in having frequently used utensils in full view, to avoid
scrambling through cabinets. About the only decorative element in
the room is a collection of the Arts &AMP; Crafts pottery Wright
favored.
</P>
<P>
   The Formica counters simulate red linen, echoing the Cherokee
red of the floor and deflecting the fluorescent lighting under the
shelves. The Currier has kept the spirit of the Zimmermans' era by
stocking the shelves with containers of Sanka and Royal Pudding,
and a copy of ``The Joy of Cooking.''
</P>
<P>
   That red floor is practical, economical, and aesthetically
pleasing: easy-to-clean poured concrete in big squares that extend
from the kitchen right through the glass doors beyond, connecting

   No doors separate the kitchen from the rest of the house;
indeed, wraparound wooden shelves unify the spaces. The cook was
not supposed to be cut off. ``Wright,'' says Startup, ``thought of
the woman of the house as an executive. The workspace would be
L-shaped. It was the fulcrum from which the American housewife
would manage her operations.''

LAWYER WINS ONE FOR THE SPAMMER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A law to ban Internet spam just took a shotgun blast to the gut,
and even as I behold the grisly spectacle, I have to admire the
artistry of the lad working the trigger.
</P>
<P>
   Washington state officials thought they had found a way to
control the flow of unsolicited e-mail advertisements into their
citizens' computers. In 1998, the state outlawed the sending of
e-mail ads with deceptive headers, designed to trick recipients
into reading them. The law also barred a common spammers' trick:
concealing the source of their unwanted messages. Spammers use fake
return addresses to prevent complaints to their real Internet
providers. Most providers respond to such complaints by canceling
spammers' accounts.
</P>
<P>
   An Oregon spammer named Jason Heckel fell afoul of this law when
he sent get-rich-quick messages to citizens of Washington state.
The attorney general's office sued in King County Superior Court;
Heckel fought back.
</P>
<P>
   His attorney, Dale Crandall, argued that the Washington law
violated the US Constitution. No, not the First Amendment. That
argument might not have flown. Commercial speech has fewer First
Amendment protections, remember? That's why the government was
allowed to ban TV ads for cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   Crandall sought his client's salvation in a less glamorous
portion of the Constitution known as the commerce clause. This
clause gives Congress the power to regulate interstate commerce.
Implicitly, it limits the rights of any state to regulate a
business located in some other state. And that's where Crandall
made his stand. By trying to regulate spam produced in Oregon, the
state of Washington was violating the commerce clause.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington attorney general's office argued that the clause
doesn't prevent all efforts to sue out-of-state firms, such as
mail-order scam artists who defraud citizens from a distance. Ah,
but the Internet is different, Crandall replied.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Bill Gates of Redmond, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   Poor helpless Bill is getting carpet-bombed with spam messages,
sent from around the world. But sent where? Not to Bill Gates of
Redmond, Wash., but to billg(at)microsoft.com. And where is this
billg? Everywhere he wants to be _ checking his e-mail from 35,000
feet above the Atlantic, or between bouts of antitrust settlement
negotiations in Chicago. And sometimes even at his desk _ but only
sometimes.
</P>
<P>
   Remember that the spammer uses e-mail addresses harvested from
the Net in various sleazy but legal ways. He has no idea where his
victim resides or whether spam is legal in that state. It'd be
extremely difficult _ in many cases impossible _ to identify the
recipient's home address. So there's no practical way for a spammer
to comply with the law.
</P>
<P>
   Defraud somebody via snail mail, and you're using a physical
address. Attack by phone, and the area code reveals the relevant
legal jurisdiction. But when you spam, you hurl your messages into
the unknown _ and this very ignorance, says Crandall, is a valid
defense against a state antispamming law.
</P>
<P>
   It's a deliciously clever argument, and it worked _ at least
this time. An appeal is probable. Crandall admits that his argument
wouldn't go very far against a federal antispam law. He'd haul out
the good old First Amendment to fight such legislation, seasoned
with a sprinkling of the equal protection clause. Crandall says any
special requirements placed upon spam, such as an advertising
warning in the message header, should also be applied to radio and
TV ads. For instance, at the start of each commercial, an announcer
might be ordered to solemnly intone, ``This . . . is a
commercial!''
</P>
<P>
   This time, Crandall ignores his earlier insight _ the Internet
is different. Radio and TV ads are obvious. But spam ads can be
made to look like something else at first glance. So it's
reasonable to require that spam be identified as spam.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there's no question that Crandall has artfully
demonstrated the problem with trying to regulate spam on a
state-by-state basis. Even sleaze merchants have rights, including
the right not to have to fret over 50 different state laws
governing spam.
</P>
<P>
   Even John Mozena, cofounder of the Coalition Against Unsolicited
Commercial E-mail, admits there's a certain logic in the court's
ruling. ``We've been saying for some time that there are potential
problems with state legislation,'' says Mozena, ``which is why we
support federal legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   Me too, John. Now more than ever.

HER APARTMENT DOOR WON'T CLEAR THE RUG 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER C. HOTTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I moved into a new apartment on the second floor. My door is
tight and protected, but it is so long that when I open it inward,
it messes up a nice runner I put down inside. I removed the
weatherstripping from the bottom edge, but two screws remain, and
scrape on the runner, and I cannot pull them out with a power
driver. How can I make that door clear the runner?
</P>
<P>
   STEPHANIE BOLLER, West Newton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. First of all, try pulling out the screws with a hand diver;
you might be able to get more torque by hand. Squirt some WD-40
aorund the screw to see if you can loosen it that way. Another
method is to use a screw extractor, sold in hardware stores.
</P>
<P>
   Short of that, you may have to cut ther door And since this is
an apartment, you may have to get the landlord to do it, or have it
done, because it may require cutting the bottom of the door.
</P>
<P>
   But this might work without cutting the door: Install
rising-butt hinges, which raise the door slightly as you open it.
Buy them in the Constantine catalog (800-223-8087).
</P>
<P>
   If that doesn't work, have a small amount cut off the bottom of
the door so it will clear the runner; then install a movable
threshold, one that pops up when the door opens, and pops down,
snugly, when it closes. These are also sold in hardware and home
supply stores.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Q. My condo is in a rebuilt factory. I had the bedroom
soundproofed, but in so doing the contractor reduced the size of
the room by 6 inches on all walls. That is a big loss of space,
which I can tolerate in the bedroom, but now I want to soundproof
my living room. How can I do it without taking so much space away?
</P>
<P>
   MIKE TWOMEY, Newburyport, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. The contractor soundproofed the room correctly by adding an
extra wall, except it did, indeed, use up a lot of space. Building
an extra wall was to separate the new wall from the old, thus
stopping the passage of sound, which is vibration that travels
through the solid parts (studs, for example) of the wall.
</P>
<P>
   You can do virtually the same thing without using up more than 2
inches or so of floor space on each wall. First, remove the wall
finish (plaster, plasterboard, drywall, or paneling), exposing the
studs. Fill the space with unbacked fiberglass insulation.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes the important part. Buy resilient acoustical channels,
which are strips of steel shaped like a square-edged ``S.'' Screw
one flange of the channel on the studs, horizontally, spaced 16
inches apart. Then screw on sound-absorbing board, and finally
plasterboard as the finish. This separates the new wall by less
than an inch from the studs, but it is enough to be effective.
</P>

   A reader from Charlotte, N.C., e-mailed this tip:
</P>
<P>
   ``In your column in the Charlotte Observer, a reader posed the
question about cleaning the fiberglass/vinyl floor of a shower
stall. I have tried each of your suggestions (Spic and Span,
Softscrub, Gel-gloss) and none have worked for me.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I found a product that worked extremely well on our shower
stall floor. It's called Zap. I purchased it from the Solutions
catalog. It's made by Sirius Products Inc. in Woodland Hills, Calif
(800-987-6564). I love it when I find a product that really works,
and like to pass on the information to other consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took a second application for our floor, but now it's back
to the original white. Hope you can use this tip.''
</P>
<P>
   The handyman can use all the tips he can get, and has put this
one in his file for future use. There are so many products out
there to do so many things that it gets very confusing, but adding
one more product won't hurt. Thanks.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Q. My 100-year-old house has shingles stained a dark brown. I
would like a lighter color. Should I paint or restain?
</P>
<P>
   NANCY MUELLER, Brookline, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Your best chance for lightening that dark brown stain is to
put another semitransparent stain on it, but don't change the color
too much. Make it a cocoa or maybe toast color. If the new stain
beads up and does not penetrate the wood, you cannot use it because
the old stain is still making the finish waterproof.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the old stain could bleed through paint or solid stain, so
I would avoid those two finishes. If you want to use a solid stain,
I suggest painting the old stain with an oil-based exterior primer
first.
</P>
<P>
   Before using any of these stains or paints on the house, try
them in a small area of the wall to see how they work, or don't
work. It always pays to experiment first.
</P>
<P>
   If the old stain is less than five years old, wait another year
or two for it to wear off and weather before trying the
semitransparent stain.

HANDS THAT SHAPE THE MIND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LINDA WELTNER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Using your hands makes you smart. Isn't that amazing?
</P>
<P>
   At Waldorf schools, boys and girls learn to knit in first and
second grades and to crochet in third. Then they go on to
cross-stitch and embroider, to work with clay and wood, to garden,
to make felt for clothing, and to sew. Playing a musical
instrument, painting, and accurately drawing objects from nature
are also fundamental to a Waldorf education.
</P>
<P>
   Rudolf Steiner, founder of the Waldorf schools, believed that
the use of the hands was essential to the development of the
intellect, and as a result Waldorf first graders learn to knit
before they learn to write or use numbers. It doesn't surprise
Waldorf teachers, who have observed children's progress for many
years, that recent neurological research has confirmed Steiner's
belief that mobility and dexterity in the fine motor muscles,
especially in the hand, stimulate cellular development in the brain
and strengthen the physical foundation of thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Because Waldorf kids are strongly discouraged from watching TV
or using computers in the early grades, my granddaughter, who is 8,
turns to these manual activities in her leisure time with great
pride and enthusiasm. At Christmas, Jessie handmade all her
presents. We're now knitting squares for a baby quilt _ 10 down, 12
to go.
</P>
<P>
   I marvel at Jessie's absorption in the task. Her right needle
must enter a tightly wound loop of yarn on the left needle and pull
the yarn held on her left hand through it. To purl, the process is
slightly different, but equally demanding. ``Only a steady,
controlled hand can accomplish such a feat, so the power of
concentration is awakened _ indeed, there is no other activity
performed by 7- or 8-year-olds that can evoke such a degree of
attentiveness as knitting,'' says Eugene Schwartz in an essay
titled ``Handwork and Intellectual Development.''
</P>
<P>
   I can't help but agree. Jessie is completely wrapped up in her
work, counting stitches, maintaining the proper tension, following
the line of yarn as closely as she will later, we hope, follow a
line of thought. In knitting, there's no room for error,
carelessness, or inattention. The task must be carried out
precisely, demanding both self-discipline and self-control. There
is something wonderful about work that requires exactitude without
any human nagging, about responsibility that derives from the task
itself. Imagine _ a dropped stitch is its own punishment.
</P>
<P>
   After Jessie binds off the last row of a square, we admire its
perfection. Each block seems an impressive accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   Jessie thinks so too. She likes the idea that she is doing
something adult. She's proud to produce a finished product equal to
anything her grandmother can make. The quilt is aesthetically
pleasing, too, a combination of coral and turquoise to be bound by
a yarn that combines various shades of both colors. The material is
soft and pliable under Jessie's fingers; there is a sensual
pleasure to this work (or is it play?) that is rhythmic and
calming. In the overstimulating environment our children inhabit,
knitting is a pathway to self-soothing, to centeredness, to a more
peaceful engagement with a stress-filled world. Looking back, I see
that I couldn't have gotten through several college courses without
it.
</P>
<P>
   Steiner believed that education should not be the means for
filling children with theoretical knowledge, but ``that it should
become a way of life, involving the whole human being.'' My friend
Mary, who teaches handcrafts at the Cape Ann Waldorf school, sees
herself in a similar way, not as a teacher of specific skills, but
as someone entrusted with the nourishment of her students' souls.
She's not training artists, she's helping children balance their
heads and hearts and hands. ``Children need a feeling life and to
develop mastery over their will,'' she says. ``When children
recognize their ability to do things in the world, they learn that
they can accomplish something with their thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   My mother, with no such ambitions, taught me to knit. To keep me
busy when I was sick and home from school, she showed me how to
turn a ball of yarn into a semblance of a scarf. Knowing how to
knit convinced me I could crochet, quilt, embroider, and sew, all
of which have brought great pleasure into my life. One thing led to
another. Could knitting have also taught me that my words and my
political ideals could be safely put into practice in the world as
well?
</P>
<P>
   Which handcrafts do you know?
</P>
<P>
   Make sure you pass them on.

JOHN PAUL'S ASTONISHING CONFESSION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Baltimore Catechism instructed generations of American Roman
Catholics that the marks of the church are four: It is one, holy,
catholic, and apostolic.
</P>
<P>
   Comes now Pope John Paul II and adds a fifth: It is sinful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lord God,'' the pope prayed on Sunday, ``your pilgrim church .
. . counts among her children in every age . . . members whose
disobedience to you contradicts the faith we profess . . . Forgive
our sins.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the pope was not technically confessing the sins of
the church itself, but those of ``her children.'' No matter. The
bishop of Rome was begging forgiveness for the cruelties and evils
that have been done in the name of the Church of Rome. This was
unprecedented, another milestone in what has proven to be the most
consequential papacy in centuries.
</P>
<P>
   An abiding commitment to truth has been a hallmark of John
Paul's stewardship. That was apparent from the outset, when he
refused to mince words in speaking about totalitarianism. His
challenge to the legitimacy of the Evil Empire triggered the fall
of Communism in Europe. And that challenge was fueled above all by
a determination, as he put it, ``to call good and evil by name.''
</P>
<P>
   In his biography of John Paul II, George Weigel quotes a Polish
student for whom the pope's pilgrimage to Poland in 1979 was a
turning point. ``We might have to live and die under Communism,''
the student said. ``But now what I want to do is to live without
being a liar.'' Moscow could withstand much but not the pope's
assault on its falsehoods.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul would have been a hypocrite if his passion for truth
had ducked the long history of Roman Catholicism. It didn't. For
years, he has spoken of the need for the church to search its
conscience; in a 1994 apostolic letter, he made it explicit. ``As
the second millennium of Christianity draws to a close,'' he wrote,
``the Church should become more fully conscious of the sinfulness
of her children, recalling all those times in history when they . .
. indulged in ways of thinking and acting that were truly forms of
counterwitness and scandal.''
</P>
<P>
   He has practiced what he preached. In 1998, one scholar counted
94 occasions on which John Paul had confessed the sins and failings
of Christians, in matters ranging from the treatment of women to
the treatment of Galileo. Since then, he has pushed the total well
into triple digits.
</P>
<P>
   The pope's plea for forgiveness does not undo the crimes
committed in the name of the church. The Jews and Muslims
slaughtered during the Crusades, the innocents burned at the stake
during the Inquisition, the massacre of French Protestants on St.
Bartholomew's Day and in the Wars of Religion, the forced
conversion of non-Christians _ the agony of the victims is not
lessened retroactively by John Paul's prayers. Neither is the guilt
of their tormentors. ``What's done is done,'' Lance Morrow writes
at Time.com. ``The ashes of heretics burned centuries ago are cold
indeed.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, genuine forgiveness can be granted only by the one
who was sinned against. The Talmud teaches that God does not
forgive the sins we commit against others unless we seek their
pardon first. That is why murder is literally unforgivable: How can
a dead man absolve his killer?
</P>
<P>
   All this the pope knew. Just as he knew that no confession of
the church's sins would be sufficient. Sure enough, scarcely were
the prayers uttered last Sunday than the reproaches began.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these reproaches were the standard PC litany. ``The
pope's apology for discrimination against women is welcome but
difficult to square with his continued opposition to abortion and
birth control, and to women in the priesthood,'' editorialized The
New York Times. ``Regrettably, he made no mention of discrimination
against homosexuals.'' The pope, in other words, should have
apologized for being Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   Other criticisms are not so easy to evade. Why did the pope,
many asked, make no mention of the Holocaust? The stony silence of
Pius XII, who spoke not a public word in defense of the Jews as
millions were shipped to the death camps, is one of the worst moral
failures in the church's long history. Perhaps the explanation has
to do with timing. Next week John Paul will visit Yad Vashem, the
Israeli Holocaust memorial; that will be the place for him to speak
about the reticence of the church during the blackest moment in
Western history.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, however, no amount of second-guessing can diminish
what this pope has done. For centuries the church has claimed to be
infallible in matters of morals. For centuries the church denied
responsibility for the brutality and slaughter committed in its
name. Yet now, on the verge of its third millennium, all that is
overthrown. A staunchly conservative pope has done something
revolutionary. John Paul ``has struck a blow at the forces of
demonization within religion,'' says Richard Landes, a medieval
historian at Boston University, ``and he has begun with his own
religion and his own institutions.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Roman Catholic Church _ the most powerful, hierarchical,
and far-flung church in the world _ can confess its gravest
failings, what excuse is there for any religion _ for any
(itals)institution(unitals) _ not to do likewise?
</P>
<P>
   The pope's confession is a moral event of seismic proportions.
The 21st century will be shaped by its aftershocks.

A TOUCH OF THE AULD SOD, IN QUEBEC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANNON, Quebec _ A Celtic cross, carved of granite and
inscribed in Gaelic, rises outside St. Joseph's Chapel. Embedded in
the floor of Shannon's Hotel de Ville, or municipal hall, is a
stone shamrock.
</P>
<P>
   In a swirl of flouncy skirts, schoolgirls rehearse the intricate
spins and steps of traditional Irish dances, their breathless
chatter flicking from English to French and back again. They've
been practicing all year, and their performance, as always, will be
the centerpiece of the town's exuberant St. Patrick's Day
festivities.
</P>
<P>
   Against all odds, this little community on the banks of Riviere
Jacques Cartier, deep in the separatist heartland of French Quebec,
has maintained a resolutely Irish identity over the course of 180
years _ a fact that only Shannonites seem to find unremarkable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, We've simply remained what we've always been,'' said Eddy
Conway, 84, a retired farmer and logger. ``Good friends to the
French, sure, but Irish to the core.''
</P>
<P>
   Conway's voice is burred by the brogue carried to the new world
by his great-great-grandparents. It was in 1826 that they quit
Kilkenny to cross the North Atlantic and carve a homestead on the
wild banks of the Riviere Jacques Cartier, which Irish locals still
insist on calling the ``Jackarty.''
</P>
<P>
   The Irish exodus of the 19th century is associated mostly with
the great cities of the eastern United States, whose character was
irrevocably changed by these Gaelic newcomers fleeing cruel poverty
and English rule.
</P>
<P>
   But huge numbers of Irish also poured into the St. Lawrence
River ports of Quebec City and Montreal. Many then flocked to tiny
farm towns in the Quebec countryside. In the bustling crossroads
that would become Shannon, for example, an 1851 census showed that
every county of Ireland was represented by the hardworking new
inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Passage to Quebec was cheaper than to Boston or New York, and
the French of Canada were Roman Catholics, like ourselves,'' said
Conway, puffing on his briar pipe. ``So the Irish by the tens of
thousands came to Quebec.''
</P>
<P>
   In Montreal, the Irish quite literally changed the urban
tapestry: The city's flag bears the Irish harp along with the
English rose, French fleur-de-lys, and Scottish thistle _ tribute
to the three peoples that most shaped the city. And for sheer size
and spirit, the St. Patrick's Day march through Montreal, a
tradition since 1824, is rivaled only by the parades of Boston and
New York.
</P>
<P>
   But Montreal is a notorious rock of anglophone culture in the
only Canadian province dominated by French. Elsewhere in Quebec,
the Irish were mostly absorbed into the French mainstream _ keeping
their surnames, but surrendering the English language and, to large
extent, Gaelic identities to become ``green French.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Assimilation is a fact,'' said Quebec demographer Jan Warnke.
``Quebec has all these O'Farrells and McCarthys who don't speak a
word of English.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so in Shannon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somehow, this has remained a true Irish enclave in the most
French region in North America,'' said Dan Griffin, who, upon
retiring from a civil service job in 1995 returned home to Shannon
to pursue his fascination with the history of les Irlandais du
Quebec _ the Quebec Irish.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an Irish feeling here that remains remarkably strong
and alive,'' said Griffin. ``They came here from counties
Kilkenney, Wexford and Carlow, and the first came in the 1820s,
before the great famine, which is unusual.''
</P>
<P>
   Roughly a third of the community's 1,850 people are of more or
less pure Irish descent, claiming English as their first language
(although the majority also speak French, often fluently). The rest
of the population is either French-Quebecer _ mainly commuters from
Quebec City _ or spillovers from the sprawling military base at
neighboring Valcartier.
</P>
<P>
   That base, which expropriated more than 8,000 acres of land in a
bitterly-contested expansion during the Cold War, has been curse
and blessing for Shannon. Many dairy farmers _ Eddy Conway among
them _ were booted from their land in 1965 to make way for new
artillery ranges, barracks and drill grounds.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the base provided a sort of linguistic shelter
from the storm that swept over the province as the Quebec
separatist movement gathered force in the 1970s, with the
secessionist Parti Quebecois _ which still governs a province that
calls itself a nation _ enacting tough ``French primacy'' laws that
spelled doom for many smaller English-speaking towns.
</P>
<P>
   But the military, as a federal institution, offered schooling in
English (or French) from kindergarten through high school.
Moreover, it offered jobs and other opportunities, and enriched the
tax base of tiny Shannon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Canadian army invaded our land, and caused considerable
suffering,'' said Griffin. ``Paradoxically, the military occupation
also was a factor in the survival of anglophone Irish culture in
Shannon.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Shannon is remarkably free of the antipathy that
marks relations between English- and French-speakers elsewhere in
Quebec.
</P>
<P>
   ``Irish and French have always been good neighbors,'' mused
Conway, who served as mayor for 14 years and remains Shannon's
unofficial archivist, using a makeshift basement photo studio to
reproduce and preserve hundreds of old black-and-white photos of
townspeople, some dating to the 1800s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Partly it's our shared religious faith,' he said. ``And,
historically, we shared a mistrust of the English.''
</P>
<P>
   French-Quebecers certainly seem to hold a special fondness for
the Irish in their midst. Of the three Quebecers to serve as
Canada's prime minister over the last few decades, only Brian
Mulroney _ a p'tit gars de Shannon, or ``little guy from Shannon,''
where his father was born _ remains beloved in his home province,
while Pierre Trudeau and incumbent Jean Chretien, both of
impeccable French heritage, are widely scorned as sellouts to
English Canada. Mulroney made headlines when he joined
then-President Ronald Reagen in singing ``When Irish Eyes are
Smiling.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Irish love Brian, of course _ he's our pure tweed lad,''
Conway said. ``And the French respect as good Quebec stock who
happens to be Irish.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether Shannon can maintain its Irish identity in the new
century is uncertain. This is a very small town, after all, and its
sons and daughters are increasingly drawn down the highways leading
to Montreal, Toronto, and beyond. Or else they marry French
Quebecers and raise their children in the language that dominates
surrounding villages and towns.
</P>
<P>
   ``For certain, we're more keenly aware of being Irish than we
were in times past,'' said Conway. ``And it's a hard truth that you
appreciate most what you are about to lose. So we'll wave our
Republic flags and raise our Guinness, but there's bit of sadness
and a lot of wondering what the future holds.''

TIMES MIRROR CEO'S LEGACY WON'T SOON BE FORGOTTEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   To recall one man's sendoff to his critics in the media, we
won't have Mark Willes to kick around anymore.
</P>
<P>
   The Times Mirror CEO (and former publisher of the Los Angeles
Times) put a bull's-eye on his back in 1997 when the American
Journalism Review picked up on his professed interest in using a
``bazooka'' to ``blow . . . up'' the wall between advertising and
news operations. From then until this week's stunning Times
Mirror-Tribune Co. merger that put him out of a job, Willes
couldn't stay out of the headlines or away from controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Compared to his colleagues _ men like Tribune Co. CEO John
Madigan, New York Times Co. chairman Arthur Sulzberger Jr., and
Washington Post Co. CEO Donald Graham (who was recently tickled in
the New Yorker for being too moderate) _ Willes was a rolling
cannon on the deck, the George Steinbrenner of media bosses. Like
Steinbrenner, he was an easy target, inspired a fierce debate about
the corrupting influence of money on his business, and will be
remembered for his outlandishness.
</P>
<P>
   In a business where bottom line pressure is steadily but quietly
grinding away at journalistic values, Willes's intemperate tongue
was his worst enemy. He boasted of plans to increase the Times's
circulation by a nonsensical 500,000 copies and stumbled with
ham-handed suggestions that the paper create a separate Latino
section and mutterings about quotas for quotes from minorities and
women.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say Willes's actions didn't speak on their own.
The former General Mills executive oversaw thousands of layoffs and
shuttered the highly regarded New York Newsday, helping earn the
``Captain Crunch'' and ``Cereal Killer'' nicknames that forever
dogged him. He created a blueprint for matching up business-side
executives with editorial sections. And he seemed willing to meet
every marketing problem with an editorial solution _ a new feature
section to snag women readers, a Latino desk to attract the growing
Hispanic population.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it all came back to haunt him. Late last year, when
word surfaced that the Times had shared ad revenues with the
Staples Center sports arena, the paper was rocked to its core.
Former publisher Otis Chandler emerged from the shadows to attack
the ``ill-advised steps that have been taken by the current
management.'' In a massive post-mortem, Times media writer David
Shaw blamed the fiasco on ``deadened sensibilities and diminished
standards.'' Willes was clearly the target.
</P>
<P>
   From the outset, Willes professed to be stunned by his critics.
In a 1998 speech to the American Society of Newspaper Editors, he
cited a bunch of high-profile detractors _ from former New York
Times executive editor Max Frankel to former Washington Post
executive editor Ben Bradlee _ and claimed their ``rush to
judgment'' left him ``flummoxed.''
</P>
<P>
   But he kept publicly propounding his vision and slowly seemed to
win converts. After the ASNE speech, one observer noted that ``he
doesn't have horns. That's what people learned here.''
</P>
<P>
   A proponent of ``civic journalism'' _ under Willes, the Times
launched a sweeping ``Reading by 9'' child literacy project _ he
earned the praise of Jan Schaffer, executive director of the Pew
Center for Civic Journalism. ``He talks the talk; he speaks like a
journalist,'' she once said.
</P>
<P>
   His basic mantra was always the same. Newspapers need emergency
triage. ``Yes, we are pushing the envelope,'' Willes told ASNE.
``And yes, we risk being remembered as the crash dummies of
American journalism.'' Asked why he was remaking the Times so
feverishly, Willes told The Boston Globe, ``We're just too slow.
You have to try a lot of things to find out what works.''
</P>
<P>
   There is evidence to suggest that Willes was not so out of step
with his colleagues. In a survey run in Editor &AMP; Publisher late
last year, 63 percent of editors and 85 percent of publishers
somewhat or strongly agreed with his call for increased cooperation
between business and news sides. So many papers have established
cross-departmental teams of editorial and business staffers to
brainstorm about the news product that former Dallas Morning News
president Jeremy Halbreich once declared that the ``news coming out
of Los Angeles . . . did not take us by surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   What Willes did do, with his penchant for loud and bold
pronouncements, was put the Times under a microscope. When the
Staples Center scandal unfolded _ forcing his inexperienced
publisher protege Kathryn Downing to offer up mea culpas _ it was
widely viewed as the chickens coming home to roost.
</P>
<P>
   Not long after the Staples episode, merger talks began in
earnest. News reports indicate that after the idea was first
broached with Willes last spring, this year's negotiations that led
to the deal circumvented him. The company's board may have soured
on Willes. Yet after the Staples story broke, The Wall Street
Journal ran a piece stating that ethical embarrassment
notwithstanding, Willes had kept the board happy by tripling the
stock price in five years.
</P>
<P>
   Even as he exits, Willes was the classic product of his times,
an era when news values must compete with the desire for sated
shareholders. His legacy reflects that.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of cleaning up the balance sheet, ``everything in the
company has been working well,'' says newspaper analyst John
Morton. ``The only place where his tenure has not been marked with
great success is the Los Angeles Times itself.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He streamlined the company, fattened it up, and made it ready
to sell,'' echoes Brill's Content chairman Steve Brill. But ``he
sure diminished the stature of the paper.''

&HT;     BAD NEWS FOR TECHNOPHOBES 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ALAN T. SARACEVIC  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ For the Luddites of the world, there is good
news and bad.
</P>
<P>
   First the good stuff: You will not be wired in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Now the bad: Instead of being wired, you will be connected
seamlessly to a wireless world of networked chips, software and
sensors, plugging you in wherever you go.
</P>
<P>
   Resistance is futile. At least that is what a group of
technology specialists gathering in San Francisco said this week.
They say the world is fast approaching the point where networked,
interactive computers will outnumber people.
</P>
<P>
   ``At every level and in every conceivable environment, computing
will be fully integrated into our daily lives and public
infrastructure,'' said David Tennenhouse, vice president and
director of research at the Intel Corp., the Santa Clara-based
manufacturer of computer chips.
</P>
<P>
   ``Computation will become so ubiquitous that we would no longer
be conscious of its every application, instead drawing on it as
frequently and reflexively as when we reach for a light switch,''
said Tennenhouse, delivering the keynote address Wednesday at
Intel's Computing Continuum Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Assembled to hear Tennenhouse's forecast were more than 500
industry professionals, academics and government officials. Their
goal is to steer the future of computer research.
</P>
<P>
   And that does not mean desktop computing. Instead, embedded
microprocessors and their accompanying software will become
omnipresent, replacing the simple human-sitting-at-computer
relationship we have just now grown accustomed to.
</P>
<P>
   Tennenhouse projected the chip industry will produce 8 billion
microcomputers this year, more than 95 percent of which will be
embedded into buildings, machinery, cars and clothing.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, said Tennenhouse, researchers remain focused on
networking desktop, business-related computers. They should shift
that focus to embedded chips for computing to reach its full
potential.
</P>
<P>
   ``The research community has no choice but to follow the numbers
of microcomputers shipped and invest a larger fraction of its
intellectual capital in this space,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``By doing this, we'll be moving from an environment in which
our sources of information are largely human-mediated to an
environment in which computers tap directly into a tremendous
volume of information concerning the world around us.''
</P>
<P>
   To illustrate how these new embedded computing devices will
work, a number of researchers were on hand to demonstrate new
applications for technology. Some of the examples displayed were:
</P>
<P>
   _ A computerized shoe, called ``expressive footwear,'' that uses
16 internal sensors to feed data on pressure and movement to a
central transceiver. Developed by academics at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, the supershoe is being tested by dance
experts at Cornell University among other places, although its
real-world applications are murky. To date, the shoe has been used
to generate music from the dancers' movements.
</P>
<P>
   _ A ``power-harvesting shoe,'' also developed by MIT
researchers, which charges a battery using the energy generated by
footsteps.
</P>
<P>
   _ A ``wireless digital input pen'' developed by Intel. It works
like a regular pen, putting ink on paper, but also records the
writer's words internally on an embedded chip. The user can then
download the words to a computer or use a wireless network to fax
the written message straight from the pen, via cell phone.
According to Wilfred Pinfeld, a microprocessing researcher at
Intel, the pen could be used to augment voice recognition software,
allowing the user to touch up words the computer's voice receiver
missed.
</P>
<P>
   _ A ``mobile augmented reality system,'' or MARS, being
developed by Columbia University in New York. Tobias Hoellerer, a
doctoral student at Columbia, came marching into a
question-and-answer session at the conference fully equipped with a
backpack, global positioning satellite antenna and a head-mounted
display screen. MARS is intended to be a situational information
machine, feeding users a stream of information on what they are
experiencing. The students working on MARS hope to get the whole
system down to the size of a Walkman, with the visual display
coming across a standard pair of eyeglasses.
</P>
<P>
   While Luddites and techies alike may recoil at this level of
computer interaction, Tennenhouse and his colleagues feel the
evolution of embedded, networked computers will actually reduce our
fear of computers, making the entire experience of technology
human-oriented, rather than machine-oriented.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to find that interactive computing will become
oppressive,'' said Tennenhouse, referring to the pervasive brand of
command-based computing popular today. ``We need to rework the
boundary between the physical world and the virtual world.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that point, we'll move from huan-centered computing to
human-supervised computing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Computer Continuum Conference is part of Intel's
``Technology for Education'' program. In 1997, Intel distributed
$90 million worth of computer equipment to 26 leading universities
to enable creative research on the use of computer technology.

REPUBLICANS SEIZE THE `GORE GAS TAX' ISSUE

<P>
   &UR; BY WILLIAM SALETAN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For more than a year, pundits have grossly underestimated Al
Gore's prospects of winning the presidency. No matter what you
think of him or how small a role you think he has played, Gore has
the best material arguments any virtual incumbent could hope for:
eight years of relative peace and unprecedented prosperity, lower
crime rates, and other achievements.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans would kill to have that record. They have no real
hope of beating Gore unless an issue emerges that threatens the
current prosperity and can be linked to the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Now they may have such an issue: rising gas prices.
</P>
<P>
   This is an opportunity to observe how politicians transform a
new event or trend into a campaign issue. Republicans used to win
elections by championing tax cuts, but lately that message hasn't
worked because people don't feel as squeezed as before. Republicans
used to win by championing national security, but lately that
hasn't worked because no foreign regime has threatened or
humiliated the United States. And Republicans used to win by
defending economic growth against environmental regulation, but
lately that hasn't worked because there's been plenty of growth.
</P>
<P>
   The rise in gas prices is enabling the GOP to revive those
themes and turn them against Gore.
</P>
<P>
   First, Republicans are accusing Gore of exacerbating the oil
squeeze on consumers by raising the federal tax on gasoline. For
seven years, Gore has bragged about casting ``the tie-breaking
vote'' for President Clinton's ``economic plan'' in 1993. Gore has
emphasized one aspect of this plan: its gradual elimination of the
federal deficit. Republicans are now emphasizing a different
aspect: the plan's 4-cents-per-gallon hike in the gas tax.
</P>
<P>
   Framed this way, Gore's ``tie-breaking vote'' becomes a
Republican issue. To make sure voters associate the tax with Gore,
Republicans are repeating not an argument or an assertion, but a
phrase. Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott says Congress should
``repeal the Gore gas tax.'' Aides to George W. Bush say he'll make
this case against Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Second, Republicans are calling Gore and Clinton soft on
oil-producing countries. At a news conference last week, Republican
senators took turns deriding Energy Secretary Bill Richardson for
visiting ``foreign'' regimes in the ``Mideast'' with a ``tin cup,''
``begging'' them to lower oil prices by increasing production. The
senators called Richardson's trip ``unseemly'' and argued that his
hosts had humiliated the United States by telling Richardson he
would have to wait for OPEC's next meeting.
</P>
<P>
   To convert gas prices into a national security issue, the GOP is
recycling the images and phrases of the 1970s. At their press
conference, the Republican senators revived the foreign policy
buzzword of that era, ``energy security.'' They likened the current
gas price surge to the ``oil embargo'' of the 1970s, and they
repeated the dreaded M-word of that decade, warning of a ``malaise
of declining domestic production.''
</P>
<P>
   On CNN, New York Senate candidate Rudy Giuliani resumed the
anti-OPEC rhetoric of the oil-shock years, arguing that Clinton has
been ``napping while OPEC was gouging America.'' On the bright
side, said Giuliani, this rip-off ``gives us a chance as
Republicans to illustrate a lot of problems in the Clinton-Gore
foreign policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Third, Republicans are turning Gore's environmentalism into an
economic issue. Republicans have complained for years that his
conservationism is costly, but voters have ignored them because the
economy is roaring. Now the GOP can point to a specific cost--gas
prices--that consumers are beginning to feel. In addition to the
gas tax, Republicans are accusing Gore of limiting the oil supply,
and thereby propping up foreign oil prices, by refusing to allow
drilling along the U.S. coast and in Alaska's Arctic National
Wildlife Refuge.
</P>
<P>
   Again, notice the GOP's language. To make voters feel good about
drilling, Bush and other Republicans call it ``exploration,'' which
they contrast with government ``regulation.'' (Democrats speak
instead of ``polluters'' and ``conservation.'')
</P>
<P>
   And to attract the middle class, Republicans accuse
environmental ``elitists'' of depriving working people of the
affordable gasoline they need to earn a living. ``When this
administration had to choose between truckers and rich
environmental extremists, it chose rich environmental extremists,''
Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, charged last week.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's team is already preparing rebuttals. He'll answer Bush's
proposed cut in the gas tax the same way he answers Bush's tax cuts
in general: calling it a risky assault on fiscal responsibility and
programs voters want. By eliminating revenue, it would take ``$600
million per month out of the Highway Trust Fund,'' angering
Americans who ``want their highways improved,'' Richardson said on
television this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   It's ``reckless'' and would ``leave our roads and highways in
disrepair,'' added a Gore spokesman. White House Press Secretary
Joe Lockhart cautioned that cutting the gas tax might endanger
``fiscal discipline.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush may have other problems exploiting the tax angle. What
Republicans call the ``Gore gas tax'' is only the final 4.3 cents
that was added to the federal gas tax in 1993, bringing the total
tax to 18.4 cents. Gore aides point out that the previous 5-cent
increase was adopted in 1990, under President You-Know-Who.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt Gore will soon be talking about the ``Bush gas tax.''
He'll also press Bush to explain his own state gas tax. Gore's
spokesman has begun pounding this point: ``There's a 20-cent gas
tax in Texas. Why hasn't (Bush) done anything about that?''
</P>
<P>
   On the foreign-policy and environmental angles, Gore has a
tougher problem. He has tried to sell fuel-conservation measures as
economically beneficial, but most voters find this argument
counterintuitive. They want to protect the environment, but not if
it hits them in the wallet. And as long as Clinton and Gore rely on
diplomacy to persuade oil-rich nations to increase supply, they'll
have a hard time fending off charges of liberal timidity and
weakness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not begging them. I'm being very firm,'' Richardson
sniffed on television last weekend. The more he vouched for his
``firmness,'' the weaker he looked.
</P>
<P>
   The gas-price issue may not propel Bush to victory. But it has
given him his first glimmer of credible hope. Last week, a reporter
asked Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle whether Republicans might
hang the issue ``around Al Gore's neck.'' Daschle scoffed,
``They're groping for an issue. They haven't been able to find one
yet.'' Now they have.

DEFLATING THE DIRIGIBLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CAROL BEGGY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It all comes down to marketing. Book editors around the country
this week received a mailing from ReganBooks, the publicity-savvy
division of HarperCollins Publishers in New York, which would
indicate that a book really can be judged by its cover.
</P>
<P>
   The uncorrected proofs of ``Making Love to the Hindenburg,'' due
out June 1 by first-time author Gordon Churchwell, have been
circulating for weeks. Now, the publisher has made the unusual move
of dispatching a new cover for the memoir about Churchwell's wife's
first pregnancy _ with the far more neutral title of ``Expecting.''
</P>
<P>
   The new title ``just better characterizes what's in the book,''
maintains Maggie McMahon, HarperCollins spokeswoman. ``It says what
the book's about.'' She insists the publisher hadn't received any
complaints about the title and cover design, which was also
changed. One can only imagine a very pregnant and very offended
copy editor objecting to being likened to an ill-fated blimp. While
the title was toned down, the artwork and subtitle were torqued up
a bit. The art morphed from a life-like photograph (two models _
not the author and his wife) to an exaggerated, cartoonish
depiction of a pregnant woman. Plus, the subtitle of ``observations
from a father-to-be'' made way for more provocative verbiage: ``One
man's uncensored memoir of pregnancy.''
</P>
<P>
   Churchwell, who lives in New York, couldn't be reached for
comment, but McMahon said he had to have OK'd the change. ``Book
titles are changed all the time,'' she noted. Making them, one
might say, a lot like diapers.

TOYOTA LAND CRUISER _ A BLEND OF RUGGEDNESS AND SMOOTHNESS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You are a builder of rugged, off-road vehicles. For nearly half
a century, you introduced yourself to drivers not only in
developing countries, where the phrase ``off-road driving'' was a
redundancy, but also in the United States, where you foresaw
off-road driving as the chosen but coming thing.
</P>
<P>
   You are Toyota, you have sold your Land Cruiser on these shores
since 1957 and, for many years, your customers wanted off-road
capabilities, highway performance be damned.
</P>
<P>
   That was then, this is now.
</P>
<P>
   And now means melding that stiff, jarring, but oh-so-much-fun
capability in an oxymoronic amalgam that adds quiet luxury. How to
pummel granite to pumice without spilling that latte?
</P>
<P>
   In the 2000 Land Cruiser _ fifth generation born in late 1998
and with antiskid capabilities this year's added feature _ Toyota
has done as well as any manufacturer in combining rugged, proven
off-road performance with subtle highway smoothness and quiet.
</P>
<P>
   The basic box that first came here as the soft-top, limited
horsepower, two-door FJ25, became Toyota's best-selling model by
the early to mid-'60s. The 1972 Land Cruiser _ first car I ever
bought brand new, for a whopping $1,995 _ was pure box. Two bucket
seats up front (lift the seats to reveal storage bins), two facing
fold-down seats in the rear, manual hubs up front, a long-stroke
six for an engine, and the essence of escape imbued throughout. I
am convinced that, without the nostalgia with which these early
'70s Land Cruisers seduced today's baby boomers, SUVs would have
been a harder sell.
</P>
<P>
   But, oh, how they have changed.
</P>
<P>
   It was in the 1980s that all Land Cruisers became four-door and
the two-door died (bring it back, please). The automatic
transmission and (gulp) air conditioning soon followed. By 1995, it
was a full-blown yuppie-mobile, favored by sports stars and the
nouveau riche.
</P>
<P>
   But even then, outer skin and bigger size aside, it had not
fully evolved. It still had solid axle suspension, which made it
suspect on road and off, a frame that could be stiffer, and a
six-cylinder engine that, while capable, was being left behind as
other upscale SUVs hit the market.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to today.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the Toyota Tundra, the first big-truck (read V8)
Japanese product to challenge US manufacturers, was still a gleam
in some designer's eye, Toyota dropped a version of the Lexus V8
into the Land Cruiser.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, it added a stiffer, nine-crossmember frame. Torsional
rigidity went up, and, with the addition of front suspension that
added double wishbones, trailer arms and a stabilizer bar, and a
4-link rear setup that includes coil springs and a stabilizer bar,
handling went from mystifying to quietly subtle.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, it still looks like a stiff box _ albeit with rounded
corners. Its flared fenders give it a muscular crouch that befits
what it will really do. Integrated fog lights and color-coordinated
front and rear bumpers and side moldings are in keeping with what
is essentially an understated look.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, the jammed interior seating is long gone. Up front, firm
leather buckets support you thigh, side, and back. The middle
seats, which split 60/40, are also firm and leather and hold three
adults with plenty of support and room. In the rear cargo area, a
three-person _ as in children _ bench seat unfolds in halves from
opposing walls. This means you can carry eight people, but with
those rear seats in use, there is no room for gear. In the front
rows, room is more than ample and headroom abounds.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the cabin, there are myriad storage bins and slots
and pockets. Every seat has a cupholder, which will please
aficionados of the where-do-I-put-my-bottle-of-water school.
</P>
<P>
   Controls are large and accessible, and I was impressed with the
size of even the secondary buttons for the audio system.
</P>
<P>
   So you ride in comfort and convenience, but you also ride in
safety. This is, after all its permutations, a very safe rig. Dual
air bags up front, side-impact door beams. Four-wheel, antilock
disc brakes bring its two-tons-plus to quick, straight stops. ABS
and antiskid aid this, of course.
</P>
<P>
   On the highway _ previously the Land Cruiser's terrain of
inconvenience _ it was smooth, supple, and surprisingly quiet.
That's because the straining 6 is gone and the Lexus-based V8 has
replaced it.
</P>
<P>
   In its earlier incarnation, it was the Lexus 4.0. Here, it's the
4.7-liter, 32-valve version _ delivering just over 15 miles per
gallon, much of that travel spent fully loaded with people and ski
gear. Coupled with a 4-speed electronically controlled
transmission, it is sedan quiet and smooth on the highway (and so
like the Tundra pickup truck) that a blindfolded rider would be
hardpressed to say in what type of vehicle they were riding.
</P>
<P>
   I remember my first Land Cruiser (and wish I had it back);
remember a New Year's Eve when we took it up a rough road to a
tower atop a New Hampshire mountain and then down no defined road
and, miraculously at the time, safely home. I suspect, swathed in
leather and luxury, I could do the same with this year's model, and
that says something for both tradition and evolution.
</P>
<P>
   Nice touches
</P>
<P>
   --The air system that runs through the ceiling. Great use of
normally unused space.
</P>
<P>
   --The easy-to-grab triangular grips that help you hoist yourself
out of the rear seats.
</P>
<P>
   Annoyances
</P>
<P>
   --The lack of space in the console bin between the front seats.
I'm not sure why this varies so much from manufacturer to
manufacturer.

&HT;     BANK PLANS TO ADD `TALKING' ATMS FOR THE BLIND 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By VICTORIA COLLIVER  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Bank of America plans to install more than
2,500 ``talking'' automated teller machines in Florida and
California as the start of a nationwide effort to make the machines
accessible to the blind.
</P>
<P>
   The first 15 machines will be installed in major markets in
California by May 15. It will be three years before every ATM in
the two states is equipped for the blind.
</P>
<P>
   The Bank of America, which operates the largest network of ATMs
with more than 14,000 machines, eventually plans to extend the
pilot program to the other 20 states where it offers retail banking
service.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a real breakthrough announcement because this is such
a big bank. I think the rest of the industry will realize this is
not some far-out radical idea,'' said Lainey Feingold, a lawyer
representing the California Council for the Blind.
</P>
<P>
   The talking ATMs will relay instructions to blind customers and
others with poor vision through a headset. The headsets will be
provided by the bank, although some people may want to use their
own.
</P>
<P>
   Bank of America is not the first bank to agree to install ATMs
for the blind. Threatened by a lawsuit, Wells Fargo &AMP; Co. became
the first U.S. bank to make that agreement in June 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Feingold said Citibank started installing some talking machines
in the fall and the Royal Bank of Canada started the process in
1997. The city of San Francisco set up a talking ATM operated by
the San Francisco Federal Credit Union in October.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Wells Fargo, Feingold said Bank of America's action was
not prompted by threat of legal action.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's part of an industry move,'' company spokeswoman Ann
DeFabio said. ``We're trying to meet customers' needs while
complying with requirements of making our services accessible.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the bank, 95 percent of existing ATMs will need
only to be upgraded to accommodate the technology. About 5 percent,
all older machines, will have to be replaced.
</P>
<P>
   DeFabio said the bank has been looking into making ATMs
accessible to the blind for the past few years and the headset
technology was necessary for privacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want someone to be able to hear it, but you don't want
someone next to you to be able to hear it,'' she said, referring to
such information and account balances.
</P>
<P>
   While many ATMs are equipped with Braille signs and number pads,
they are next to useless because they do not explain what is
happening on the screen.

MEDWED'S CINEMATIC, AMUSING `HOST FAMILY' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
HOST FAMILY 
By Mameve Medwed 
Warner Books, 309 pp., $23.95 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For more than 20 years Daisy and Henry Lewis have been a host
family for international students attending Harvard. At a reception
featuring ``white wine and foods-from-many-nations,'' they're
praised as ``the rock of stability, the very model of a model
family,'' and honored with an award for their ``Generous
Hospitality and Caring Friendship.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lewises are clearly heading for a swift fall. Sure enough,
minutes after the award ceremony, Henry breaks the news to Daisy in
a seedy sushi bar. ``Our marriage. I think it's run its course,''
he says.
</P>
<P>
   Daisy, though she feels ``kicked in the gut,'' responds by
asking, ``Like a horse put out to pasture? A car that flunked its
one-hundred-thousand mile checkup and needs to be traded in?''
</P>
<P>
   Anxious and insecure, Daisy has a compulsive need to make jokes.
It's one of her charms as a character, but it's a bit of a
liability, too: There were times when I found myself wishing that
Daisy weren't quite so adorably neurotic. Meg Ryan could play her
in the film adaptation. Mameve Medwed's shamelessly charming second
novel has ``movie'' written all over it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Host Family'' is more ambitious than Medwed's first, ``Mail.''
It's funnier, too _ and, for better or worse, slicker. Medwed tells
the story in the present tense in the third person, but from
Daisy's viewpoint. With her flights of free association (``Like a
perverse variation of Proust's madeleine, the throw-up has released
a stream of memories . . .''), Daisy can be a little tiresome.
Seeing certain events through the eyes of one or two of the other
characters might have made for a more satisfying novel.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say ``Host Family'' isn't engaging. It's fun to
read, perhaps especially if you know Cambridge. Like ``Mail,'' it's
set in and around Harvard Square on the fringes of the university
community. Medwed knows the landscape: She's lived and worked in
Cambridge for years, and she has a certain milieu down cold. The
plot of ``Host Family'' progresses at the Rialto Bar, in Holyoke
Center, in Pennypacker Hall, in the Holden Green married students'
housing complex, at the Border Cafe.
</P>
<P>
   Daisy and Henry are recognizable types, Harvard graduates who
stayed on in Cambridge close to what a neighbor of mine used to
call, without a shred of irony, ``the center of the universe.'' The
Lewises live in a big Victorian house near Porter Square. They've
reared a trophy son, Sammy, a Harvard freshman. Daisy organized
food banks for years and now works as an ombudsman for a
supermarket chain. Henry is an expert on computer viruses.
</P>
<P>
   Daisy is described as a woman who has made a career of settling
for less. That's certainly true when it comes to her husband. Henry
calls himself ``Henri,'' sports a beret, and peppers his
conversation with French phrases. He's fascinated with all things
French, especially a red-haired exchange student named Giselle.
</P>
<P>
   Once dumped, Daisy doesn't waste any time. Within hours of
Henry's bombshell, Daisy has met Truman Wolff, an earnest
parasitologist whose work on the host-parasite relationship
provides an extended metaphor for ``Host Family.'' Soon Truman has
Daisy appreciating the beauty of bloodsuckers and the symmetry of
symbiosis. As it happens, Truman's wife has left him for a French
pastry chef, so he and Daisy bond over their mutual hatred of the
French.
</P>
<P>
   The French connection is one of a number of coincidences,
contrivances, misconceptions, and misunderstandings that keep
``Host Family'' perking along. Daisy's son and Truman's daughter
fall in and out of love. The Lewises' very first exchange student,
an irrepressible Indonesian, returns to Cambridge a changed man.
Daisy's glamorous, much-married best friend becomes involved in an
unlikely romance. Everyone is afflicted with lice, which leads to
nit-picking, literal and figurative. It's probably not giving away
too much to reveal that the novel's penultimate scene is a happy,
communal Thanksgiving feast that seems made for a major motion
picture.

   Intensity is the quality that immediately springs to mind when
one is around Michael Patrick MacDonald. There is, first of all,
the intensity of MacDonald himself. A husky Irish-American with
piercing blue eyes, the 34-year-old author-activist seems
perpetually distracted and permanently coiled, like a combat vet
reliving his last firefight.
</P>
<P>
   ``People tell me that whatever made me a survivor, they should
bottle it,'' says MacDonald, scowling. ``But that kind of talk just
pisses me off. I don't want anyone to bottle it. It was not fun to
live through. Making kids more resilient is not what being a kid
should be about.''
</P>
<P>
   There is, too, the intensity of MacDonald's book. ``All Souls: A
Family Story from Southie'' was published in September by Beacon
Press and excerpted in The Boston Globe. In its seventh printing,
the book is a bittersweet coming-of-age saga set in South Boston
during the 1970s and 1980s, chronicling a series of family
tragedies, including the deaths of four of MacDonald's siblings,
that occurred within a proud community besieged by social change
and bedeviled by violence and denial.
</P>
<P>
   Two of MacDonald's older brothers committed suicide. Another
brother, a promising boxer, was killed at age 24 during a bungled
armed robbery. A 19-year-old sister was abusing drugs when she flew
off a rooftop in Southie, leaving her severely brain-damaged. The
youngest of Helen MacDonald's seven living children (all raised
without a father around) graduates from college this year, despite
his arrest _ at age 13 _ in the shooting death of a friend. Those
who did not lose their lives bear other scars, the book attests,
some inflicted by neighborhood predators like ex-Southie crime boss
Whitey Bulger.
</P>
<P>
   Michael MacDonald, born ninth in the family pecking order,
eventually went into community activism, working on initiatives
like the Boston gun buyback program and cofounding the South Boston
Vigil Group and Southie Survivors. In 1998, he was featured in a
documentary film titled ``Strong At the Broken Places: Turning
Trauma Into Recovery,'' produced by Oscar-winning filmmakers
Margaret Lazarus and Renner Wunderlich. Last summer, MacDonald also
toured Northern Ireland as part of a peacekeeping mission. Over the
past few years, he has spoken in hundreds of venues on behalf of
organizations like Facing History and Ourselves. Like Holocaust
survivors, MacDonald has borne witness to the past in order to help
others confront it and move forward with their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael didn't come by this book in six months,'' says Sandy
King, an antiviolence crusader in Southie who's worked closely with
MacDonald. ``He's been writing it in his head his whole life.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, MacDonald sweated over the book _ his first _ for
nearly two years. The results so far, including more than 40,000
copies in print, have surpassed even his sunniest expectations.
Reviewers are already comparing the memoir to such classics as
Claude Brown's ``Manchild in the Promised Land'' and Betty Smith's
``A Tree Grows in Brooklyn.'' Amazon.com lists 54 customer reviews,
all raves. Mail has poured in from around the country, from people
and places with no ostensible connection to Southie. The
activist-turned-storyteller is an author-with-a-capital-A now.
</P>
<P>
   Beacon Press editor Deanne Urmy says it's no surprise that ``All
Souls'' has struck such a universal chord.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael had a great personal story to tell, but that's not why
I bought the book,'' says Urmy, who rates it among the highlights
of her 20 years in publishing. ``The social-justice issues were
just burning for him. He was making connections I had literally
heard no one else make.``
</P>
<P>
   It is, finally, this intensity of reaction to MacDonald's book
that is most extraordinary. At one extreme are the Southie
residents _ by most accounts, no more than a handful _ who have
taken offense at what MacDonald wrote about them and their Old
Colony neighbors. Several scheduled readings were disrupted or
canceled last fall due to safety concerns. Urmy was visited by
three Southie families that ``wanted to vent,'' as she puts it,
although no explicit demands were made. MacDonald won't talk about
it on the record but says that while the situation has calmed down,
he still takes threats of violence seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen too much in my lifetime not to,'' he explains.
</P>
<P>
   At the other extreme are scores of readers, many high-school
aged or younger, who have given MacDonald the sort of feedback no
amount of hype can buy. Again and again, they write about not being
able to put the book down, about laughing and weeping on the same
page, about the courage it took for MacDonald to portray tragedy
without sentimentality.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the great achievements'' of the book, wrote one reader
from New York, ``is to let us know just how short of facts we are.
You explode stereotypes and replace them with real people.''
</P>
<P>
   A Georgia woman who lived through school desegregation in
Atlanta said the book made her want to volunteer in urban schools
again. A Dorchester native praised its unsparing look at the
culture of violence. ``I have spent a lifetime running from it, you
faced it down and made a difference,'' the woman wrote.
</P>
<P>
   MacDonald has heard from clergymen, cops, filmmakers, social
workers, therapists, single moms, and African-Americans who watched
Southie desegregate from the opposite side of the school bus
windows. One reader, a lawyer, urged MacDonald to file a
class-action suit against the FBI, modeled on smokers' suits
against Big Tobacco, for allowing Bulger to terrorize Southie
residents with impugnity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The crime and violence you mention also helped me to realize
that I wasn't the only `white' Irish-American wondering why the
press and everyone else thought that the problems of inner-city
youth were reserved only for people of color,'' wrote another
reader, echoing a major theme of MacDonald's. ``Your book had a
profound and heartwarming impact on me. It helped me to reaffirm my
identity and to continue my struggle to help inner-city children
succeed . . . ''
</P>
<P>
   MacDonald lugs around dozens of these letters in a battered
manila envelope. In some ways, they are the only home he has. Last
fall, again for safety reasons, he moved out of his apartment in
Southie. Since then, he's either been on the road or staying with
friends in the Boston area. He figures he has done about a hundred
readings since ``All Souls'' came out, appearing all over the
country in pubs and bookstores as well as in classrooms and college
campuses.
</P>
<P>
   What has happened over the past five months ``has been
overwhelming _ and not all good,'' says MacDonald, during an
interview in Dorchester last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easier responding to the negative comments,'' he avers,
``than to go someplace like Downtown Crossing, where people
recognize me and want to tell me their life stories. It's great
they react that way, I mean, but it's almost too much to bear. An
80-year-old woman in Denver told me she was not the same person
after reading my book. Eighty years old. That was it for me. I was
in tears.''
</P>
<P>
   Jen McAuliffe, a 20-year-old Southie resident and cofounder of
Southie Survivors, says the reaction she's seen locally has been
overwhelmingly positive. ``People are kind of in awe about it,''
says McAuliffe. ``It's about our Southie but with different
examples.''
</P>
<P>
   King says MacDonald can be generous almost to a fault.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael drives me nuts sometimes,'' she says. ``We'd be on our
way to some appointment, and people would stop him in the street
and tell him some ungodly story for two hours. Because he feels a
lot of pain, especially for the young people in this community, he
has a hard time walking away.''
</P>
<P>
   While gratified by the reaction in Southie, MacDonald says that
part of what writing the book did was allow him to let go of
Southie in a way.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I left before _ '' in the late 1980s _ ``I hated the
place,'' he says. ``Now I don't. I only felt unsafe there because
of a few people. And not the gangsters, either. They have bigger
concerns than me, believe me.''
</P>
<P>
   MacDonald did change some names in the book, he admits, though
not names published in news accounts of Southie's woes. He decided
the name issue case by case. Still, he says, ``It's hard to change
any name when you're into this truth-and-reconciliation thing.

   ``My grandfather once told me, `Forget you lived in the projects
and get on with your life,' '' he says. ``But I also came to
realize that my mother's personality was partly a rebellion against
that sort of hush-hush Irish attitude. It wasn't `mind your own
business' for her, it was `open the windows and scream.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Helen MacDonald, now 66, moved to Colorado 10 years ago, where
she lives with her daughter Kathleen, son Joseph, and Kathy's
12-year-old daughter. While in many ways the central character in
``All Souls,'' she has not read the book all the way through,
according to MacDonald.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother was standoffish at first, but she accepted it,'' he
says. ``She knows what's in the book, but she hasn't read it all.
And she still doesn't like to talk about the sex parts. On the
other hand, she wants to fly back East and take on anybody who says
a bad word about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Some traumas will never heal, MacDonald suggests. His brother
John, 42, lives in Costa Rica. Years ago the two of them had a
bitter falling out over John's role in the shooting for which
13-year-old Stephen MacDonald was tried and convicted (the
conviction was later overturned). Though the brothers patched
things up, says MacDonald, they have not spoken for a couple of
years. John is also estranged from other family members, according
to MacDonald.
</P>
<P>
   Of all his siblings, says MacDonald, his sister Kathy, 38, is
the most tragic figure. Severely incapacitated since she plunged
from a rooftop in 1981, she spends most days in the recesses of her
own diminished memory, scrawling antibusing slogans from the 1970s
on scraps of paper as if stuck in some cruel Santayana-esque time
warp.
</P>
<P>
   MacDonald also says he's unbothered by criticism that his book
was somehow not judgmental enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people think my mother was a saint for the way she raised
her children, others think she's a horrible person,'' he avers.
``What I want is for readers to decide for themselves. I want them
to feel the power of denial. Mostly I wanted to get away from my
activist's voice and into my storyteller's voice, because that's
what I see myself as now. I would have been miserable writing a
book that asks, `Why, oh why did my brother Frankie get involved in
cocaine?' That's a different book. Not this one.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the present keeps weirdly harking back to the past
for MacDonald, who is thinking about moving to New York in the near
future and embarking on a second book: possibly another memoir,
almost certainly a continuation of his interest in young people,
social trauma, and the healing process.
</P>
<P>
   ``To say the least, it's been an interesting few months since
the book came out,'' he says with a laugh. ``Judge Garrity died.
Dapper O'Neil retired. Bodies got dug up out by the Southeast
Expressway. And that's just around here.''
</P>
<P>
   Stories like the Columbine High School or Flint, Mich.,
shootings come along, MacDonald continues, and the same finger
pointing follows that helped keep Southie down for decades. How
does a first-grader get a gun? outsiders ask. What kind of music
are those teenagers listening to? politicians want to know.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we should all be asking,'' says MacDonald, ``is, `where
was I when this happened?' When you see all the hand-wringing over
teenage culture, over listening to Marilyn Manson records, it's
clear that most people don't have a clue.''
</P>
<P>
   His blue eyes flash with intensity. ``Kids know the world is run
on lies,'' MacDonald hisses. ``That's the real problem. They're
going to act out because of it. I'm not into anger or resentment or
blame. I'm into telling the truth.''

DO YOU REALLY NEED TO USE PREMIUM GASOLINE? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For many of you, the recent news stories about gasoline brought
back ugly memories of the long lines of cars in the 1970s, when
drivers waited in those lines to pay exhorbitant amounts of money
for gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   And now, the stories warn, we are in the midst of another
explosion in gasoline prices. Some say prices may hit $1.85 or even
$2 per gallon by this summer, the peak travel season. Even now,
we're paying $1.65 and higher for premium gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   Many of you buy premium gasoline because that is what your car
requires and, hey, it hasn't been that expensive anyway. Others
burn premium, even though their cars can handle regular, because
they think it improves their car's performance or gives better gas
mileage or helps keep the engine clean, or is better for the
environment.
</P>
<P>
   But now many are asking themselves if they should keep pumping
the high test into their cars, or if they should save money and use
a lower grade of fuel.
</P>
<P>
   It's a fair question _ oddly, AAA estimates that only 5 percent
of the cars sold in the United States require premium gasoline, yet
20 percent of the gasoline sold is premium _ and it's a question
that's all about octane.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of people think octane somehow is directly related to
power obtained from the fuel you burn; that 92 octane, say, somehow
gives your car more power than 87. Octane, however, is not a
measure of power.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, octane measures how resistant a grade of fuel is to
combustion. And it might surprise you to know that the lower the
octane level, the more combustible the fuel. But doesn't combustion
equal power? Not by itself.
</P>
<P>
   And here's where octane comes in. Some engine basics: An engine
generates power when fuel and air are mixed in the cylinder,
compressed by the piston, and detonated by the spark plug.
</P>
<P>
   Compress the mixture tighter _ high-compression engines _ and
you get a more even, explosive burn. These are the engines that
require high-octane (harder to detonate) gasoline. Why?
</P>
<P>
   Because in the process of compression, it is possible for the
mixture to detonate by heat or friction before the spark plug
fires. This sends a screaming fireball upward in the cylinder. But
before that fireball consumes all the mixture, the spark plug
fires, and another screaming fireball goes in the other direction.
The piston, riding the engine's inertia, pushes up through the
downward explosion before beginning its descent.
</P>
<P>
   This is the phenomenon that causes loud pings and knocks. It can
burn a hole in a piston, wreak havoc with your engine. It is a very
bad thing.
</P>
<P>
   Lower-compression engines are set to fire their spark plugs
earlier in the compression process, so lower-octane fuel (easier to
detonate) is no problem for them.
</P>
<P>
   So, faced with rocketing gasoline costs, what do you do?
</P>
<P>
   John Paul, a spokesman for AAA in New England, has simple
advice: Read your owner's manual and follow it.
</P>
<P>
   Gasoline comes in three grades, for the most part: regular, 87;
midgrade, 89; and premium, 92 or 93.
</P>
<P>
   Burn what the manual tells you to burn.
</P>
<P>
   If you put lower-grade fuel in a high-compression engine, you
are endangering the engine. And in summer, when ambient
temperatures are higher, the octane requirements of all engines are
a bit higher, so it is even more critical then.
</P>
<P>
   And not only will you endanger your engine, you will also
probably get worse performance and worse gasoline mileage.
</P>
<P>
   But what if you drive a car that can run on 87 or 89, but are
using 92 or 93 for better performance, to help keep your engine
clean, or because it is better for the environment?
</P>
<P>
   You might as well take that extra money and give it to the next
squeegee man who puts his face in your windshield and wipes it with
a dirty rag with one hand while he holds out the other.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Trade Commission says that, as a rule, high octane
does not out-perform regular octane in helping to remove engine
deposits or keep your engine cleaner. All grades of gasoline must
contain engine-cleaning additives, so the additive you get at $1.85
per gallon is likely the same you'll get at $1.50.
</P>
<P>
   And if your concerns are environmental, consider that it takes
far more energy to produce high-octane gasoline at the refinery
than it does to produce regular.
</P>
<P>
   So here's the octane rule to live by: If your car does not knock
or ping on 87 or 89, that's what you should run. You're wasting
money running higher-octane gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   If your owner's manual says you need premium gasoline, use
premium gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   That settled, Paul, of AAA, has a couple of other tips for you:
</P>
<P>
   Make sure your tires are inflated properly. Millions of gallons
of gasoline are wasted every year in engines powering vehicles on
improperly inflated tires.
</P>
<P>
   ``And, hey,'' Paul says in a blast from the '70s, ``you could
always car pool. Two people in a car doubles the gas mileage.''
</P>
<P>
   About gasoline mileage figures
</P>
<P>
   I read in my newspaper's Ombudsman's report last Monday that a
reader was concerned I do not list EPA estimates for gasoline
mileage in my car review columns.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody asked me, but it reminded me of a great line from a Dan
Jenkins book, ``Baja Oklahoma,'' in which a woman wanders into a
bar and finds her husband seated in a chair with a young woman on
his lap. ``Who you gonna believe _ me or your own eyes?'' the
culprit responds.
</P>
<P>
   I don't use EPA estimates because I don't need to. They are
estimates, they are broad, they do not factor in real-life uses for
vehicles other than highway or city (and how many of us drive
exclusively in either situation?).
</P>
<P>
   Here's what I do: drive cars, which have been broken in before I
get them, between 800 and 1,000 miles each week. I haul kids to
soccer, garbage to the recycling center, myself in and out of
Boston on the interstate. I put them through snow, mud, water, on
country roads, fine highways.
</P>
<P>
   And when I am done, I figure what each vehicle got for gas
mileage and I include that figure in each of my reviews.
</P>
<P>
   No estimate. Just what my own eyes tell me.

   &UR; BY MICHAEL KINSLEY &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When Ted Kennedy failed to pry the 1980 Democratic presidential
nomination away from incumbent Jimmy Carter, he declared, ``The
dream will never die,'' and it was pretty clear what he meant.
</P>
<P>
   When Bill Bradley last week gave up his challenge to Al Gore, he
declared, ``We have been defeated, but the cause for which I ran
has not been.'' And I, for one, don't have a clue what he was
talking about.
</P>
<P>
   Was it health-care reform? That is what he pushed hardest in the
campaign, but it's an issue he never made much of until then. (And
the Clinton-Gore administration may be guilty of many things, but
failing to push for comprehensive health-care reform _ as Bradley
framed the accusation _ is surely not one of them.)
</P>
<P>
   Was it campaign reform? Bradley opportunistically came to
emphasize this issue, but I actually heard him tell an audience
early on that it would not be a high priority in his first term.
</P>
<P>
   Was it moving the Democratic Party back solidly to the left? If
so, this theme is also one that comes from nowhere in Bradley's own
political record.
</P>
<P>
   When John McCain, in ``suspending'' his campaign, declared that
he would ``never walk away from'' the ``necessary cause of
reform,'' he could plausibly be taken to mean campaign-finance
reform. But he intended _ and was surely taken by supporters _ to
mean ever so much more.
</P>
<P>
   After all, despite the undoubtedly corrupt campaign-finance
system, the four major candidates for the two party presidential
nominations fought this race on a relatively equal footing: Bradley
raised almost as much money as Gore, and McCain had ``free media''
help easily worth as much as Bush's millions.
</P>
<P>
   I wonder if the typical McCain voter can name a single example
of an actual government policy perverted by campaign contributions.
There are plenty of examples available, to be sure, but the hunger
for ``reform'' that McCain tapped into is on a higher level of
abstraction.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley and (especially) McCain voters are now the Easter eggs
for which everybody is hunting, like ``soccer moms'' in '96 and
``Reagan Democrats'' in '92. The media want their quotes; the
candidates want their votes. Everyone wants their approval due to
their apparently superior moral standards. But what do they want?
</P>
<P>
   Here's what they want: They want change. They want reform. They
want a new politics. They want values and ideals. They want trust
in the wisdom of the people. They want a positive message. They
want an insurgent and/or a maverick.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what they don't want: They don't want politics as usual.
They don't want corruption. They don't want negativity. They don't
want Washington or anything else inside the Beltway, including the
establishment and the elite.
</P>
<P>
   They are utterly dissatisfied with the slim pickings they are
offered in the voting booth. Any system that comes up with Al Gore
and George W. Bush is, to them, self-evidently flawed.
</P>
<P>
   Some people might observe that the choice between a
moderate-conservative governor of a major state and a
moderate-liberal sitting vice president should not be all that
painful _ that in fact this result reflects the machinery of a
mature democracy functioning pretty smoothly. Everyone across the
political spectrum, including those in the middle, will have
someone reasonably compatible and qualified to vote for. The system
producing this result may be bizarre or even corrupt but isn't all
bad. Some people might believe all this, but these
``Bradley-McCain'' people strongly disagree.
</P>
<P>
   The Wall Street Journal editorial page looks at their rejection
of two moderates and recommends feeding them a right-wing stew of
tax cuts seasoned with school vouchers. The Nation says the way to
their alienated little hearts is a diet of left-wing boilerplate.
</P>
<P>
   But these voters reject the traditional labels of left and
right. That is the Old Politics. The New Politics is about _ well,
it's about something else. Treat these folks right or they may not
vote at all, just to teach you a lesson.
</P>
<P>
   These are the Perot voters of '92 and the Newt Gingrich brigades
in '94, or their heirs. They're the people who demanded that no
politician be permitted to serve his or her country in the same
position for more than six years, who elected a string of new
Congress members on this issue six years ago and are about to
re-elect several for a seventh and eighth year of service.
</P>
<P>
   They are, by and large, not poor or black, not unemployed or
disabled. They are living through the most spectacular economic
boom in history, in a nation almost totally secure, invulnerable,
and at peace with the world. Science is curing major diseases. Yet
another record-mild winter is ending. And they are furious at the
politicians for creating this awful mess.
</P>
<P>
   The Party of Inchoate Outrage seems to be a permanent feature of
the political landscape. But there aren't many people walking
around with actual steam blowing out of their ears. For most, it's
just a convenient posture in a culture where it seems almost
unpatriotic not to be politically alienated.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine the courage it would take to tell a pollster, ``No,
actually politics as usual is fine with me.'' People say they want
politicians they can look up to, and they probably do want one or
two of these, for show. But they also want a general class of
politicians they can look down on.
</P>
<P>
   An all-encompassing disgust with the whole filthy business is a
way to claim your good-citizenship merit badge without earning it.

<P>
   As I type these words on a late afternoon, I can see the Chicago
River just outside my office window in the gloam of a Monday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   To the east, the river is a sturdy shade of steel gray-blue _
but under the Michigan Avenue Bridge, that fine color gives way to
an artificial green.
</P>
<P>
   It's quite putrid. We're talking about a green usually found
only in Jo Anne Worley's closet, circa ``Laugh-In.'' Think lime
meets chartreuse and they both spill their drinks. If your daughter
came home from college with her hair this shade, you'd cut off her
tuition support.
</P>
<P>
   The city dyes the river every year as part of our ever-expanding
St. Patrick's Day festivities, which include thousands of beer
promotions at local taverns (``Win your own genuine Irish pub!'');
dozens of ``St. Patrick's Day Sales'' at all kinds of stores;
several skyscrapers (including the Hancock Building and Sears
Tower) bathing their crowns in green lights; two huge parades;
dozens of concerts, dances and parties.
</P>
<P>
   Oh yeah, and some people go to church.
</P>
<P>
   For the year 2000 we're actually getting a St. Patrick's Day
week. March 17 doesn't arrive until Friday, but Mayor Daley won't
allow weekday parades in the city unless it's a legal holiday _ so
we had the Chicago march last Saturday, followed the next day by
the South Side Irish Parade.
</P>
<P>
   This gives us plenty of time to nurse our hangovers and rest our
``Danny Boy'' vocal chords so we can return strong and rowdy for
the 17th. (Or to continue hibernating while growling about all the
overserved boobs who turn this March Madness into ``Amateur
Night.'')
</P>
<P>
   Not that there's typically any serious trouble related to
Chicago's version of Mardi Gras. In fact, considering the volume of
alcohol consumed and the sheer numbers of revelers at the various
parades and inside the bars, it's a miracle that St. Patrick's Day
isn't marred by rampant hooliganism. You're more likely to see two
big red-haired lugnuts singing and hugging than swinging and
slugging each other.
</P>
<P>
   But there is one disturbing trend that surfaces every year at
this time, and it's reason enough to keep me out of the pubs for
the most part. Something so insanely goofy that I cringe just
thinking about it.
</P>
<P>
   I'm talking about American guys doing Irish accents.
</P>
<P>
   We don't imitate Pope John Paul II on Casimir Pulaski Day and
unless we're John Rocker-heads we sure don't lampoon Martin Luther
King's dialect on the day named in his honor; we don't do Italian
or Mexican accents on the designated dates on which we honor those
great cultures.
</P>
<P>
   The Irish voice, though _ too many Chicago-area men can't resist
doing it. Even worse, some of them lapse into it while in the
presence of Irish natives.
</P>
<P>
   I've seen it happen, more than once. A guy who was born in
Little Company of Mary Hospital, attended St. Thomas More grade
school and went to Brother Rice or Mt. Carmel followed by a stint
at DePaul _ in other words, he's never lived anywhere but here _
will be talking in his normal ``Chi-caw-guh'' voice when he's
introduced to someone from Dublin.
</P>
<P>
   Six beers later, the Chicago guy is sounding like Brendan Behan
on a bender, calling the waitress ``lass'' and ordering ``another
four pints for me and the lads,'' even though everybody at the
table is drinking Bud Light. It's ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone thinks the Irish accent is easy to do, but it's not.
For proof of that, consider that many trained and famous American
thespians have butchered the voice, from Tom Cruise in ``Far and
Away'' to Richard Gere in ``The Jackal'' to Julia Roberts in
``Michael Collins'' to Brad Pitt in ``The Devil's Own'' to Danny
Noonan's girlfriend in ``Caddyshack.''(I still can't figure out why
she was an Irish girl.) They're all so cartoonishly overwrought
that you half-expect to hear them say, ``Always after me Lucky
Charms!'' and be done with it.
</P>
<P>
   If any of the aforementioned is ever given a lifetime
achievement award, don't expect to see their Irish schtick in the
highlight montage, unless someone is trying to get some easy
laughs.
</P>
<P>
   So if most pros can't wrap their voices around the Irish accent,
what chance to the amateurs have? Let it go, boys.
</P>
<P>
   And yes, it's almost always a male tendency. As we've noted here
before, women rarely do impersonations or accents in public because
they know how nutty it makes them sound, whereas men insist on
doing their ethnic voices and their celebrity impersonations
because they're, well, stupid men.
</P>
<P>
   Have all the fun you want with this extended faux-holiday, but
unless you're trying to be a buffoon, don't sport the ``Kiss Me,
I'm Irish'' button all day, don't say ``Top 'o the mornin' to ya!''
to anyone, don't order the green-tinted beer, don't wear the gag
Leprechaun-print tie to work _ and leave the Irish accent in the
shower.
</P>

 By FRANK RICH  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    In the old rehearsal snapshots from 1957, three of the four men
who created ``West Side Story'' look as cool as the Jets and
Sharks.
 &HT;    The choreographer Jerome Robbins, the playwright Arthur Laurents
and the composer Leonard Bernstein are all dressed in '50s hip.
Only the true kid of the group, the 27-year-old lyricist making his
Broadway debut, seems out of place.
 &HT;    Stephen Sondheim is in a tie and a loud, boxy sports jacket, his
hair slicked back, his grin forced _ a geek trying to cut it with
the popular crowd.
 &HT;    Yet the appearance is deceiving. Perhaps even more than his
collaborators, he was a rebel advancing a cause: a new, jarring,
adult kind of Broadway musical.
 &HT;    Like most Sondheim efforts to come _ among them the landmark
shows ``Company,'' ``Follies,'' ``Sweeney Todd'' and ``Sunday in
the Park With George'' _ ``West Side Story'' wasn't the smash
commercial hit of its season. It lost the Tony Award to ``The Music
Man.''
 &HT;    But it also upended the genteel conventions of an American art
form then exemplified by ``My Fair Lady.'' The future's
possibilities seemed boundless, for both the musical theater and
the four young artists retooling it.
 &HT;    Now that future has come _ and gone. Bernstein and Robbins are
dead, having deserted Broadway long before their passing. Laurents
is still a busy playwright at 82, but musicals aren't high on his
agenda. That leaves Sondheim, who turns 70 on March 22.
 &HT;    So obscure in 1957 that he wasn't even mentioned in The New York
Times review of ``West Side Story,'' he is now the greatest and
perhaps best-known artist in the American musical theater.
 &HT;    But that is a somewhat empty distinction. Sondheim may be the
last major creator of Broadway musicals, period, still actively
devoted to the trade. He may have even outlived the genre itself,
which was long ago exiled by rock music from center stage to niche
status in American culture and is now barely a going concern.
 &HT;    Sondheim doesn't dispute that he is a dinosaur. ``It's
discouraging,'' he says, as he lists his vanished contemporaries
and concludes that ``only John and Freddie'' _ Kander and Ebb, the
songwriters of ``Cabaret'' and ``Chicago'' _ remain as active in
musical theater as he is.
 &HT;    Nor is the Broadway of 2000 the one of his youthful dreams. For
nearly two decades, the Winter Garden, where ``West Side Story''
jump-started his career, has been monopolized by ``Cats.''
 &HT;    ``You have two kinds of shows on Broadway _ revivals and the
same kind of musicals over and over again, all spectacles,''
Sondheim says. ``You get your tickets for 'The Lion King' a year in
advance, and essentially a family comes as if to a picnic, and they
pass on to their children the idea that that's what the theater is
_ a spectacular musical you see once a year, a stage version of a
movie. It has nothing to do with theater at all. It has to do with
seeing what is familiar. We live in a recycled culture.''
 &HT;    Using his imminent birthday as an excuse, Sondheim and I are
meeting for a series of conversations to take stock of his life,
his career, the theater. We convene in the Turtle Bay area
townhouse he has lived in since 1960 but which he spent two years
rebuilding after a devastating 1995 fire.
 &HT;    Sondheim's arm was in a sling after a fall in London, and as he
puts it: ``I'm not particularly upbeat these days. The last year
has not been good.''
 &HT;    A revue of his songs, ``Putting It Together,'' was closing after
only three months on Broadway. The recent off-Broadway workshop of
his new musical, ``Wise Guys,'' a project that he feels has
consumed too much of the past decade, went awry and was, he says,
``a waste of time.''
 &HT;    I first met Sondheim just as his reputation was starting to
skyrocket _ when he was 41 and I was 21 _ after he wrote me a
letter about my college newspaper review of the Boston tryout of
``Follies.'' He was the first professional writer to give me the
courage to believe I might be one too.
 &HT;    Long before that, he played a role in shaping my lifelong
passion for theater, for ``Gypsy'' and ``A Funny Thing Happened on
the Way to the Forum'' were formative events in my theatergoing
childhood.
 &HT;    ``If Mama Was Married,'' a song from ``Gypsy,'' was the first
song I'd ever heard about being a child of divorce, which I had
recently become, and it pointed me toward Sondheim before I knew
his name.
 &HT;    Our initial real-life encounter led to a spotty acquaintanceship
that was over well before my 14 seasons of reviewing theater for
The New York Times, during which I had no contact with him at all.
 &HT;    In those years, ending in 1993, my adoration of ``Sunday in the
Park'' was offset by my unenthusiastic reviews of Sondheim's
saddest Broadway failure, ``Merrily We Roll Along,'' and one of his
rare crowd-pleasers, ``Into the Woods.''
 &HT;    When a book of my criticism was published after we had
re-established contact, he told me, ``I'd forgotten how rough you'd
been about my shows.'' But he didn't seem cross about it. By this
point, we shared too much else, including our alarm that Broadway
was turning into a theme park.
 &HT;    Sondheim thinks I was right to end my full-time engagement with
the theater just before the Disney deluge, yet he hasn't moved on
and never would.
 &HT;    The man who wrote ``I'm Still Here'' may despair over Broadway,
but it would never occur to him to leave it. Though he has outlived
not only the traditional Broadway of his childhood but also the
new, more urbane Broadway he ushered in for my generation, his tone
is more regretful than angry. The only time he cut me off was when
I began a question with the phrase, ``When you grew up ...''
 &HT;    ``I never grew up,'' he interjected, with a finality that
foreclosed any follow-up. This may explain how Sondheim has
remained an artist and why, for all his sophistication, he can seem
guileless, even naive.
 &HT;    Over tea, dinner, nightcaps, he was willing to answer any
question, whether speaking unsentimentally of the ``very
unpleasant, paranoid, suspicious'' Robbins (``I can't even say that
I miss Jerry _ I miss Jerry's impact on shows'') _ or of other
Broadway songwriters or his often-solitary personal life. He rarely
went off the record.
 &HT;    At the time of our meetings, he was also, despite his recent
setbacks, surprisingly sunny (for him) about the future. And though
he doesn't think 70 is a big deal _ ``I don't want to spend the
next six months being iconized'' _ some special events this spring
tickle him.
 &HT;    In May, the New York Philharmonic will stage a three-nights-only
concert performance of ``Sweeney Todd'' starring Bryn Terfel and
Patti LuPone.
 &HT;    The Museum of Television and Radio is saluting Sondheim for
three months on both coasts, even unearthing kinescopes of TV
scripts he wrote in the '50s.
 &HT;    In Washington, a Library of Congress concert will include his
1974 adaptation of Aristophanes' ``Frogs'' as well as non-Sondheim
material _ songs culled from a cheeky, revelatory list Sondheim
drew up with the title ``Songs I Wish I'd Written (At Least in
Part).''
 &HT;    Sondheim has also taken heart from the New York premiere, at
off-Broadway's Second Stage, of his novice professional effort,
``Saturday Night,'' written before ``West Side Story'' and
abandoned when its producer died. The show had been consigned to a
trunk for nearly half a century.
 &HT;    For those of us who don't find Sondheim's songs pretentious and
unfeeling, the lyric at the top of ``Saturday Night,'' sung by
lonely young men in Brooklyn desperate for romance _ ``so what can
you do on a Saturday night, alone?'' _ encapsulates the deeply felt
Sondheim signature emotion: the aching, ambivalent and often
thwarted desire to connect with someone.
 &HT;    It's the naked yearning that also runs through ``With So Little
to Be Sure Of,'' ``Too Many Mornings,'' ``Being Alive,'' ``Pretty
Women,'' ``Not a Day Goes By,'' ``Finishing the Hat.''
 &HT;    Sondheim talks about the days when, with Hal Prince, who in 1957
would be a producer of ``West Side Story,'' it was possible to ``go
down the street and see somebody else's show and know that we were
all talking the same language.''
 &HT;    Rock 'n' roll was exploding then, but Sondheim says: ``Rock
didn't affect me because the overlap was when shows were still
popular so I could afford to ignore it. It was not part of my
generation; it was the generation 10 years under me.
 &HT;    ``To be 24 in 1954 as opposed to being in your teens is all the
difference. I knew where I was and what I wanted to do. And through
the '50s and '60s, the kind of shows I liked were still viable:
those that developed stories through song in which the songs had
individual voices. There was enough success going around, and so
you were encouraged to do more.''
 &HT;    By the '80s, however, Sondheim could no longer ignore the
reality that rock, rising costs and what he sees as ``dumbing
down'' were endangering his Broadway.
 &HT;    ``The source of what was popular in music had shifted from
movies and shows to records,'' and even the number of musicians in
Broadway pit bands had been downsized by half.
 &HT;    ``What's happened to the theater,'' he says, ``is one thing that
does depress me a lot because it is such a large part of my life.
You'd go and see other shows that would stimulate you, that would
make you want to write. Now it makes you not want to write because
you think the audience isn't there anymore. The audience that is
there is not an audience who would either like or respond to the
kind of stuff I write except with, if anything, kind of detached
bemusement instead of getting involved.''
 &HT;    The Broadway community has fled too. ``There's none whatsoever.
The writers write one show every two or three years. Who
congregates at Sardi's? What is there to congregate about? Shows
just sit in theaters and last.''
 &HT;    We commiserated about the latest Broadway calamity _ the
eviction of the nonmusical play. The theater district used to be
ablaze with musicals, dramas, star vehicles and fluffy comedies all
side by side. At one point this season, there wasn't a single
recently written comedy or drama running on Broadway _ a grim
historic first.
 &HT;    ``When was the last time you saw a straight play when you
couldn't wait to get on the phone and tell your friends?'' Sondheim
asks rhetorically _ then gives an excited answer to his own
question, sounding like a boy still infatuated with the theater
after all: ``'How I Learned to Drive.' I saw it with Arthur
Laurents. I loved it! We danced out of there. I got on the phone _
we couldn't wait to see something else on the stage _ anything!''
 &HT;    But ``How I Learned to Drive'' was produced off-Broadway, not
on, and three years ago.
 &HT;    Not that Sondheim is romantic about Broadway's past. He sees it
too lucidly. As for his own music, Sondheim says: ``I'm accused so
often of not having melodic gifts, but I like the music I write.
Harmony gives music its life, its emotional color, more than
rhythm.''
 &HT;    Among the composers Sondheim most admires is, fittingly, George
Gershwin, who also spanned the gamut from Tin Pan Alley to
``serious'' musical theater.
 &HT;    Sondheim thinks ``stars are great'' for the theater, but doesn't
believe the theater has any stars now except itinerant visitors
from movies and TV.
 &HT;    Bernadette Peters comes closest, he says, but when ``she does a
show that's a hit like 'Annie Get Your Gun,' she has to stay with
it for two years. In the old days, Bernadette would have done at
least as many shows as Merman, a couple of dozen. She's done maybe
10 shows.''
 &HT;    Sondheim's own favorite star performances in musicals, his or
others? Among male performances, he unequivocally cites two: Alfred
Drake in ``Kismet'' and John McMartin in ``Follies.'' The list of
women is longer, including Peters in ``Sunday in the Park,'' Angela
Lansbury in ``Sweeney Todd'' and ``obviously, Ethel (Merman) was
thrilling in 'Gypsy.'''
 &HT;    He misses much of old New York, including the local steak house,
Christo's, where he wrote some of ``A Little Night Music'' in a
booth. Nor is he enamored of the malled Times Square.
 &HT;    ``I'm nostalgic for the things that aren't there anymore,'' he
says. ``I want things to be the way they were because that staves
off mortality. So I feel threatened by change.''
 &HT;    Sondheim has mentored many young songwriters, including Adam
Guettel, whom he finds ``dazzling,'' and the late Jonathan Larson,
of ``Rent'': ``Jonathan was on the path of making that bridge
between the bus-and-tunnel audience and the young audience. But
nobody else does that because other writers into pop don't have
Jonathan's interest in the tradition of musical theater.''
 &HT;    Still, Sondheim is surprised by the steady contacts from young
writers who want to emulate him. But he dispenses realistic advice.
 &HT;    ``I say write it and put it on any place you can. I warn them
Broadway is no longer an outlet for new work. I'm lucky I get my
shows on.''
 &HT;    Indeed the vulnerable quality that makes Sondheim's songs so
haunting _ those aesthetic stutters that illuminate the cracks in
people's lives _ is to me always visible in the man.
 &HT;    Sondheim is well defended with intellectual armor, yet he is
still the precocious, awkward kid in the rehearsal photos of ``West
Side Story,'' ``the boy in the bubble,'' as he described himself to
his biographer, Meryle Secrest.
 &HT;    I'm eager to give Sondheim the reassurance he once gave me, and
start to say that since he has always defied the crowd, he might
endure even if Broadway does not.
 &HT;    But Sondheim deflects this emotional plea on his behalf as soon
as he detects it.
 &HT;    ``I've never been popular,'' he reiterates quickly, as if to
say, What's the use of wondering if there's any other way his story
could have turned out.

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    In the old rehearsal snapshots from 1957, three of the four men
who created ``West Side Story'' look as cool as the Jets and
Sharks.
 &HT;    The choreographer Jerome Robbins, the playwright Arthur Laurents
and the composer Leonard Bernstein are all dressed in '50s hip.
Only the true kid of the group, the 27-year-old lyricist making his
Broadway debut, seems out of place.
 &HT;    Stephen Sondheim is in a tie and a loud, boxy sports jacket, his
hair slicked back, his grin forced _ a geek trying to cut it with
the popular crowd.
 &HT;    Yet the appearance is deceiving. Perhaps even more than his
collaborators, he was a rebel advancing a cause: a new, jarring,
adult kind of Broadway musical.
 &HT;    Like most Sondheim efforts to come _ among them the landmark
shows ``Company,'' ``Follies,'' ``Sweeney Todd'' and ``Sunday in
the Park With George'' _ ``West Side Story'' wasn't the smash
commercial hit of its season. It lost the Tony Award to ``The Music
Man.''
 &HT;    But it also upended the genteel conventions of an American art
form then exemplified by ``My Fair Lady.'' The future's
possibilities seemed boundless, for both the musical theater and
the four young artists retooling it.
 &HT;    Now that future has come _ and gone. Bernstein and Robbins are
dead, having deserted Broadway long before their passing. Laurents
is still a busy playwright at 82, but musicals aren't high on his
agenda. That leaves Sondheim, who turns 70 on March 22.
 &HT;    So obscure in 1957 that he wasn't even mentioned in The New York

perhaps best-known artist in the American musical theater.
 &HT;    But that is a somewhat empty distinction. Sondheim may be the

devoted to the trade. He may have even outlived the genre itself,
which was long ago exiled by rock music from center stage to niche
status in American culture and is now barely a going concern.

and concludes that ``only John and Freddie'' _ Kander and Ebb, the
songwriters of ``Cabaret'' and ``Chicago'' _ remain as active in

 &HT;    Nor is the Broadway of 2000 the one of his youthful dreams. For
nearly two decades, the Winter Garden, where ``West Side Story''

say, What's the use of wondering if there's any other way his story
could have turned out.

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    It was 10:30 on the evening of Dec. 28, but darkness had
descended over central Tibet just an hour before.
 &HT;    Sunset comes late here because Tibet runs on the same clock as
Beijing, 2,000 miles to the east.
 &HT;    In the remote, beautiful monastery of Tsurphu, the seat of the
17th Karmapa, head of the Karma Kagyu school of Tibetan Buddhism,
most of the monks were already busy with their evening studies.
Others were settling down to watch the 10:30 news on the television
set that only recently had been installed.
 &HT;    Parked outside the monastery was a Mitsubishi SUV, ostensibly to
take one of the senior monks on a fund-raising trip to northwest
Tibet. The driver waited behind the wheel, nervous but resolved.
 &HT;    Only a few hours earlier, he had been admitted to a secret that,
had it been betrayed, would have brought the immediate arrest of
all involved. The 17th Karmapa was about to try a daring escape
from Tibet.
 &HT;    Earlier that day, the 14-year-old religious leader had entered
what had been announced as an eight-day religious retreat in his
private apartment.
 &HT;    Up in his personal quarters, though, the Karmapa was making an
unusual set of preparations.
 &HT;    He laid aside his maroon monk's robes and dressed in a pair of
trousers, a down jacket, a warm hat, a pair of spectacles and a
scarf. Then he opened his bedroom window and, followed by his
elderly attendant, climbed carefully onto the roof of the shrine
hall that housed the effigy of the Karma Kagyu's protective deity,
Mahakala.
 &HT;    The old man and his young charge worked their way along the roof
toward the end of the building, a route that took them directly
over the roof of a guardhouse. It was a drop of less than 10 feet
to the ground, then only a few yards to the waiting vehicle.
 &HT;    But as the two crept along the roof, they heard the voice of
their accomplice, the monk who was preparing to depart for his
supposed fund-raising tour. He was engaged in a loud conversation
with an unseen man below _ perhaps one of the many monks at Tsurphu
who were paid to report signs of disloyalty to the Chinese regime.
 &HT;    The Karmapa and his attendant froze and crouched down on the
roof until the conversation ended and the straying monk had stepped
back inside. Finally they dropped to the ground and ran to the SUV.
Amid a tense silence, the four men drove off.
 &HT;    More than two months later, the consequences of the lama's
dramatic flight are still being played out.
 &HT;    As he stole off into the night, the Karmapa could not have
suspected that within days of his arrival in northern India he
would be regarded by many as a possible future leader of the
100,000 exiled Tibetans, the potential temporal successor to the
exiled ruler of Tibet, the Dalai Lama.
 &HT;    Nor could he know _ though he certainly feared _ that
embarrassed Chinese authorities would reportedly detain his parents
as well as close the Tsurphu monastery to visitors and reshuffle
its security personnel and management.
 &HT;    It is also unlikely that he anticipated the worldwide sensation
his flight would cause, or the diplomatic crisis it would touch off
between India and China _ a crisis so severe that the Karmapa
himself would be forbidden to speak publicly of why or how he fled.
 &HT;    This is the story of that escape, based on the account of a key
participant who, fearing for the safety of friends, associates and
family in Tibet, would not allow himself to be identified.
 -0- 
 &HT;    In 1992, at the age of 7, Ugyen Trinley Dorje _ the Karmapa's
given name _ had been recognized as the reincarnation of the
deceased 16th Karmapa and plucked from his nomad family in eastern
Tibet.
 &HT;    Shortly thereafter, in a ceremony attended by about 20,000, he
was enthroned in the 12th-century Tsurphu monastery in the
Drowolung valley in central Tibet, some 40 miles northwest of
Lhasa.
 &HT;    An appealing child with a remarkably direct gaze, Ugyen Trinley
had impressed his followers with his intelligence and seriousness
of purpose. As a high incarnate lama recognized both by Beijing and
the Dalai Lama, Ugyen Trinley enjoyed a privileged existence even
in today's Tibet.
 &HT;    The Chinese government indulged him, hoping to use him to
legitimize its rule over Tibet and to blunt the impact of the Dalai
Lama's international campaign for autonomy. At the same time, he
was worshiped by the followers of Karma Kagyu, one of the most
influential of the four schools of Tibetan Buddhism around the
world.
 &HT;    But now Ugyen Trinley was 14, and the red-cheeked nomad boy had
grown into a young man nearly six feet tall, and he was looking for
something more than toys and kind words from Beijing. He had
reached an age when the tradition of the Karma Kagyu demanded that
he begin to receive the teachings of his lineage _ that he become
the latest link in a chain of oral transmission that stretches
back, unbroken, for nearly a thousand years.
 &HT;    Each previous incarnation of the Karmapa had received the
teachings from a master lama (the word lama simply means
``teacher'') who had himself received them from a previous
incarnation of the Karmapa.
 &HT;    But how was Ugyen Trinley to receive those teachings? Tai Situ
Rinpoche and Gyaltsab Rinpoche, the masters anointed to teach him,
were both in India, part of the vast Tibetan diaspora that had
formed in the aftermath of the failed 1959 uprising against the
Chinese.
 &HT;    Ugyen Trinley had made repeated requests to travel to India to
study with them. They, in turn, had asked for permission to visit
him in Tibet. But since Tai Situ Rinpoche's last trip, in 1993,
Beijing had refused.
 &HT;    At same time, the young Karmapa was developing a mind of his
own.
 &HT;    Kagyu monks tell of the Karmapa's reluctance to pay homage to
the Panchen Lama (the second most important reincarnate lama, who
was chosen by the Dalai Lama against the wishes of the Chinese and
then disappeared with his family after being apprehended by Chinese
security forces). Or of the time the Karmapa slapped the face of a
Gelugpa lama in a dispute in 1995.
 &HT;    Then there was his general reluctance to toe the Communist Party
line. When the local party representative asked him last year to
read a speech prepared by local party officials, he refused.
 &HT;    ``Do you wish me to say,'' the Karmapa inquired, ``that I am
giving this speech on your behalf?''
 &HT;    The startled party representative explained that the speech was
to be delivered as though it were his own.
 &HT;    ``In that case,'' said the Karmapa, ``I have no need of this
text.''
 &HT;    No speech was given.
 &HT;    Word of the Karmapa's discontent inevitably filtered out. The
Dalai Lama was alarmed to hear last year that the Karmapa wanted to
leave; he feared for the boy's safety. A message was hastily sent,
counseling patience.
 &HT;    The Karmapa waited, but with a growing conviction that the
longer he did, the harder it would be to escape. Already he was
under surveillance.
 &HT;    In addition to the spies and informers, uniformed security
personnel controlled access to the monastery and scrutinized the
Karmapa's mail. He could not leave the monastery for any reason
without the permission of his Chinese-appointed management. He had
begun to feel like a prisoner.
 &HT;    To escape was a terribly risky enterprise. But for his
followers, the Karmapa is a ``bodhisattva,'' a manifestation of the
Buddha, whose vision goes beyond the mundane. He saw his flight as
his spiritual destiny.
 &HT;    Entrusting the planning to one man in his entourage _ who in
turn had chosen two more _ the Karmapa had insisted that his escape
must be accomplished before the Lunar New Year, which was Feb. 5.
That left just over two months to prepare.
 &HT;    The three men had been under no illusions about the scale of the
challenge: to smuggle Tibet's most prominent reincarnate lama out
of a heavily guarded monastery, run for a border that at its
closest point was about 200 miles away, cross that border unnoticed
and somehow reach Dharamsala in northern India, the exile home of
the Dalai Lama. It was a project so audacious that many continued
to believe it was impossible, even after it had been successfully
completed.
 &HT;    The route the party took was one of several they had considered,
each with its own set of dangers. It ran through western Tibet to
Mustang, in Nepal, about 400 miles from Lhasa. It was extremely
long but relatively unguarded.
 &HT;    Among its other advantages, the road, while not good, was
passable with the right vehicle as far as the border, and the
border crossing itself was often unmanned.
 &HT;    Finally, to cross into Nepal a traveling businessman did not
need a passport but only a permit, which could be obtained from an
army camp near the border. The planners knew that once they got
over the border, whatever difficulties they encountered would be
secondary. They also knew that until that moment, there would be no
second chances. They had prepared meticulously, and they knew
exactly what lay ahead.
 &HT;    A few weeks earlier, two of them had obtained permits for a
business trip and had reconnoitered the route as far as Lo
Manthang, just inside Nepal. They had taken photographs and noted
all the potential dangers _ primarily, Chinese checkpoints (manned
on some occasions but not others) or army barracks.
 &HT;    They returned to Tibet _ their mission apparently unnoticed by
the security services _ with a detailed understanding of what they
had to do. They submitted their plan, along with the photographs,
to the Karmapa for his approval.
 &HT;    They knew that good cover stories were essential. Neither the
fund-raising trip nor the business trip were unusual events. The
purchase of the Mitsubishi _ a more suitable vehicle than the truck
that had been used for previous fund-raising trips _ was made
without attracting attention.
 &HT;    Finally, the Karmapa announced his intention to observe an
eight-day religious retreat in his private chambers. The retreat,
nothing out of the ordinary for him, provided eight days in which
the watching eyes of the monastery spies would not expect to see
him. Only his teacher and his cook would attend him behind the
closed door of his private apartments.
 &HT;    The date had been set for the 21st day of the 11th month in the
Tibetan calendar _ Dec. 28.
 &HT;    And from the moment they drove away from the monastery, with a
long journey ahead and a border to cross, stopping only to change
drivers, all night and all the next day, their plan worked well.
Even the checkpoints that the two scouts had so carefully logged
were all unmanned.
 &HT;    It was not until 11:30 p.m. on Dec. 29, the second night of
their escape, that they reached a section of the road that they
knew to be dangerous. They were nearing the border, and the road
ran within 800 yards of the first of two Chinese army camps.
 &HT;    It was already dark, but not, they decided, dark enough for the
risky passage ahead. Two of them were to drive past the camp
without lights. The rest, including the Karmapa, would take to the
mountains on foot and rendezvous back on the road, beyond the
danger zone.
 &HT;    They waited until 1:30 a.m., then three men and the Karmapa
slipped out of the vehicle and began their arduous climb. In the
dark, they picked their way through thorn scrub, frequently
stumbling in the night. It took four hours to reach the other side
of the mountain, their hands lacerated by thorns and their legs
bruised from frequent falls. To their dismay, there was no sign of
the Mitsubishi.
 &HT;    Had the others been captured, they wondered. Had they missed
them in the dark? If the vehicle had simply missed them, perhaps
they could still meet up.
 &HT;    It was still dark, but dawn was not far off. They decided to
head for the border on foot, even without provisions and despite
the bitter weather, and stay on the road as long as it was safe. An
hour later, to their inexpressible relief, they made out the
Mitsubishi driving slowly toward them. It had overshot its
destination and, as they predicted, was coming back to look for
them.
 &HT;    Half an hour after driving through the second army camp
unchallenged, they reached Nyichung, passing the pillar that marks
the unmanned border with Mustang, Nepal. They drove across.
 &HT;    On the Nepalese side of the border, the track was hardly fit,
even for an SUV. Besides, the party had no permit to drive their
vehicle in Nepal, and they did not want to attract official
curiosity. So they left the vehicle in the care of a family on the
Mustang side of the border, telling them they would come back for
it in a few days.
 &HT;    To continue their trek, they hired horses and rode to Lo
Manthang, two hours away. There, in the house of a Karma Kagyu
devotee, they had their first night's rest since fleeing Tsurphu.
Early the next morning, Dec. 31, they rode on.
 &HT;    They traveled without a break for another complete day and night
until 7:30 the following evening, when they reached the Manang
district, a popular spot for trekkers in the shadow of the
Annapurna Range. They spent the night there in a tourist lodge.
 &HT;    The next day, Jan. 2, they rode by helicopter _ in this terrain,
it is either yaks or helicopters _ to the outskirts of Katmandu,
the Nepalese capital, then took a taxi across the border into
India. The Nepalese border guards were happy to accept a bribe to
overlook their lack of travel documents.
 &HT;    From the Indian border, their incredible journey continued. They
took a rickshaw to the nearest railway station _ at Gorakhpur _
where they boarded a train to Lucknow. In Lucknow, they hired
another taxi.
 &HT;    After a further 24 hours of continuous driving, they reached New
Delhi, the Indian capital, on the evening of Jan. 4. There they
changed taxis and drove on through the final night of their journey
to Dharamsala, the home of the Dalai Lama.
 &HT;    Disaster threatened on the final leg of the journey as their car
skidded off the road in a fog. Miraculously, as the Karmapa's
followers see it, nobody was injured. Finally, at 10:30 on the
morning of Jan. 5, they reached Dharamsala.
 &HT;    Since leaving Tsurphu eight days previously, they had slept only
twice in a bed. Their euphoria was tinged with fear for those left
behind.
 &HT;    On Jan. 31, they telephoned the Karmapa's residence from Nepal.
A stranger answered the telephone and they heard noises and
shouting in the background, so they quickly hung up. The fates of
the Karmapa's teacher and his cook remain unknown.
 -0- 
 &HT;    Exhausted, the group checked into the Bhagsu Hotel in McLeod
Ganj, a little town uphill from Dharamsala.
 &HT;    Less than an hour later, the Karmapa, painfully thin and
windburned, with lacerated hands and open sores on his feet, strode
into the audience chamber of an astonished but delighted Dalai
Lama.
 &HT;    ``It was a moment of great emotion,'' says one monk who
witnessed the meeting. ``Leaving aside everything else, they are
two great bodhisattvas, and the understanding and affection between
them was very moving.''
 &HT;    The Dalai Lama ordered the group moved to Chonor House, the
government-in-exile's official guest house, and sent his doctor to
examine them. After a brief reunion with Tai Situ, the exhausted
Karmapa went to bed and slept until 11 the next morning.
 &HT;    As news of his sensational escape raced around the world, the
Indian and Chinese governments were caught off balance.
 &HT;    Beijing issued a hasty statement. The Karmapa, it said
unconvincingly, had left a note in the monastery explaining that he
had gone to get his crown, a ritual object that is presently in
Rumtek monastery, the former seat of the 16th Karmapa. The Karmapa
had made it clear, according to Beijing, that he did not intend to
stay away or to ``betray'' the ``motherland.''
 &HT;    In New Delhi, the reaction was a mixture of anxiety and
disbelief _ anxiety about the Chinese response and disbelief that
such an escape was possible without either the assistance of
Tibetans in India or the connivance of the Chinese government.
 &HT;    New Delhi dispatched intelligence officers to Dharamsala to
interview the escapees. While it waited for the results of its
inquiries, the government asked the Dalai Lama's officials to
ensure that the Tibetans said nothing that would inflame the
already delicate situation.
 &HT;    With that, an official silence descended on the subject of the
Karmapa's escape.
 &HT;    The Karmapa himself was moved to a monastery on the outskirts of
Dharamsala, where Indian army guards now strictly limit access to
him. The few who gain admittance are searched minutely. In the
short term, at least, the Karmapa had exchanged one set of
restrictions for another.
 &HT;    Within days of the Karmapa's dramatic appearance in India, the
senior lamas of the Karma Kagyu were flocking to Dharamsala to pay
homage to their spiritual leader and to consult with the Dalai Lama
about the boy's future.
 &HT;    An elderly Kagyu monk has been named the Karmapa's tutor, and
now the young Karmapa divides his time between his studies and his
hobby of writing poems and songs. But New Delhi remains silent on
the matter of his exact status, and many questions still hang over
his future.
 &HT;    Among the most intriguing of those questions is the role that
the Dalai Lama envisages for a young companion whom he never
expected to meet.
 &HT;    The Dalai Lama will be 65 this year and is well aware that
Beijing is waiting expectantly for him to die. With the Dalai Lama
out of the way, the Chinese could hope that the Tibet issue will
begin to fade from prominence.
 &HT;    Without its spiritual leader, moreover, the community in exile,
prone as it is to disputes and sectarian quarrels, might very well
fragment. Divided and leaderless, it would no longer present a
problem to Beijing.
 &HT;    But the arrival of the Karmapa offers a different possible
narrative. He is young and charismatic and could clearly provide a
focus in the future for Tibetan loyalties.
 &HT;    A respected spiritual leader and already a forceful character,
the Karmapa could be well positioned to speak for his people in the
absence of the Dalai Lama or during the infancy of the Dalai Lama's
next reincarnation.
 &HT;    If the Dalai Lama keeps the young Karmapa close _ and succeeds
in passing on his own vision for the future _ Tibetans could find a
new leader, and China could face a new and formidable adversary.

 By AMY BLOOM  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    I have been treating a young girl since her father's sudden
death six months ago.
 &HT;    One Saturday night, while her mother is out with her new
gentleman friend, she makes what we in the business call a
``suicidal gesture,'' which is much less than a full-fledged
attempt, but obviously a sign that all is not well, and not likely
to be, anytime soon.
 &HT;    She is in the hospital from Sunday to Friday. On Friday, the
``discharge planner'' calls to notify me that my young patient will
be returning home that afternoon.
 &HT;    Her five days of covered hospitalization are now up, and since
she is no longer a threat to herself (no suicidal gestures during
the four full days of her hospital stay), and was never a threat to
others, the HMO says it is time to go. Moreover, it won't pay for
family therapy.
 &HT;    I suggest that a weekend of hanging around with her mother and
the new beau is not a great treatment plan for an impulsive,
nonverbal kid. A few more days might give her a chance to connect
to the other kids on the unit, to have several sessions of family
therapy with her mother, to come to terms with having found herself
in a hospital in the first place.
 &HT;    I tell the planner what a great girl this is (she is not a great
girl yet. Right now she is a sad, confused, self-pitying and
irritable girl, but she might become a great girl, with some help)
and the planner sighs.
 &HT;    ``Well,'' she says, ``how about medication?''
 &HT;    It is the consensus of her treatment team, including me, that
what is needed is more talking, more strolling around the grounds
with the sympathetic nurse's aide, whose own father died in a car
accident, some intensive help for her and Mom at the hospital and
more room to grieve.
 &HT;    ``Medication for what?'' I ask.
 &HT;    ``For whatever. We could probably keep her another 11 days with
a medication trial.''
 &HT;    Prescribing psychotropic medications for school-age children is
a booming business these days. Ritalin's production alone is up 700
percent since 1990, and stories like mine are commonplace.
 &HT;    As a result, a battle has arisen between the pro-medication and
anti-medication camps: heated, public and utterly spurious. Some
children need medication; others don't. The real trouble lies in
how we make that assessment.
 &HT;    This process begins before the doctor ever sees the patient. The
person with the cash, the power and even the transportation usually
gets to identify the patient, setting the stage for all subsequent
decisions.
 &HT;    Which is why women without children were called ``barren'' and
men without were just unlucky; why Freud treated the obstreperous
Doras but not their parents; why aged, uncertain parents find
themselves in nursing homes against their will.
 &HT;    It is especially so when the murky questions of behavior and
psychology are raised: Is it adolescent moodiness or pre-Columbine
sociopathy? Was she born that way or did we make her that way?
 &HT;    The theoretical basis of family therapy _ and common sense _
holds that the most vulnerable point in the family structure will
reveal its stress first. And the way children show stress is often
called ``symptoms.'' Parents, of course, do not always wish to
interpret the symptoms, nor are family doctors always trained to
read them. Even well-intentioned parents who wish to make things
better, quickly, may override their child's experience and capacity
to express it.
 &HT;    For American children right now _ especially the fidgety, the
distractible and the extra-lively _ their vulnerability is made
worse by a ghastly convergence of social anxiety, overwhelmed and
uninspired schools and widespread fixation on the bottom line.
 &HT;    Find a symptom, find a treatment, treat it and, in a modern
twist, make it no one's fault. Fix them, we say.
 &HT;    And these new drugs do ``fix'' them _ quickly, inexpensively and
inappropriately. We fix them at a younger and younger age _ these
days even when they're toddlers. And we do so even when we use
medications intended for adults. As a result, 4 million children
are on Ritalin and 2.5 million are on antidepressants.
 &HT;    Attention deficit disorder and hyperactive disorder (both
formerly known as minimal brain damage, but nicely renamed by the
drug companies) do exist, and it would be cruel to withhold Ritalin
from children who suffer from them. Just as it would be unfair to
stigmatize them as spoiled brats and ridiculous to blame their
concerned parents.
 &HT;    But these drugs are being wildly prescribed because they are
cheaper and less time-consuming than psychotherapy and much easier
to sell, both to the consumer and to the average family doctor.
Prescriptions are less work than conversation and careful
evaluation. And handing out medication at lunchtime is easier than
creating classes that keep intelligent and curious kids from
squirming, daydreaming and talking back.
 &HT;    Most of all, we prescribe medications for children who don't
need them because the medications are available, and a cure for
parental vanity and irresponsibility _ along with the single-minded
greed of HMOs _ is not.
 -0- 
 &HT;    A couple come into my office. They tell me they are happily
married and need only a consult on their child, who is ``out of
control.''
 &HT;    The husband says that he is a fair disciplinarian (although it
seems to me that it must be difficult to get much disciplining done
between his arrival home at 8 p.m. and the child's bedtime at 8:15)
and that the mother, full time at home, is a pushover who can
neither keep to a schedule nor follow through with suitable
consequences. She says that he has no idea what he is talking
about, since he is never home, and that he makes unreasonable
demands on her and their 6-year-old.
 &HT;    I suggest that their family is both under stress and producing
it. They cancel the next appointment.
 &HT;    They call a year later. Their daughter is on Ritalin because of
Attention Deficit Disorder, which is now official, and the kids
make fun of her for the daily trip to the nurse. Can I suggest
someone who will help boost her self-esteem?

 By AMY BLOOM  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    I have been treating a young girl since her father's sudden
death six months ago.
 &HT;    One Saturday night, while her mother is out with her new
gentleman friend, she makes what we in the business call a
``suicidal gesture,'' which is much less than a full-fledged
attempt, but obviously a sign that all is not well, and not likely
to be, anytime soon.
 &HT;    She is in the hospital from Sunday to Friday. On Friday, the
``discharge planner'' calls to notify me that my young patient will
be returning home that afternoon.
 &HT;    Her five days of covered hospitalization are now up, and since
she is no longer a threat to herself (no suicidal gestures during
the four full days of her hospital stay), and was never a threat to
others, the HMO says it is time to go. Moreover, it won't pay for
family therapy.
 &HT;    I suggest that a weekend of hanging around with her mother and
the new beau is not a great treatment plan for an impulsive,
nonverbal kid. A few more days might give her a chance to connect
to the other kids on the unit, to have several sessions of family
therapy with her mother, to come to terms with having found herself
in a hospital in the first place.
 &HT;    I tell the planner what a great girl this is (she is not a great
girl yet. Right now she is a sad, confused, self-pitying and
irritable girl, but she might become a great girl, with some help)
and the planner sighs.
 &HT;    ``Well,'' she says, ``how about medication?''
 &HT;    It is the consensus of her treatment team, including me, that
what is needed is more talking, more strolling around the grounds
with the sympathetic nurse's aide, whose own father died in a car
accident, some intensive help for her and Mom at the hospital and
more room to grieve.
 &HT;    ``Medication for what?'' I ask.
 &HT;    ``For whatever. We could probably keep her another 11 days with
a medication trial.''
 &HT;    Prescribing psychotropic medications for school-age children is
a booming business these days. Ritalin's production alone is up 700
percent since 1990, and stories like mine are commonplace.
 &HT;    As a result, a battle has arisen between the pro-medication and
anti-medication camps: heated, public and utterly spurious. Some
children need medication; others don't. The real trouble lies in
how we make that assessment.
 &HT;    This process begins before the doctor ever sees the patient. The
person with the cash, the power and even the transportation usually
gets to identify the patient, setting the stage for all subsequent
decisions.
 &HT;    Which is why women without children were called ``barren'' and
men without were just unlucky; why Freud treated the obstreperous
Doras but not their parents; why aged, uncertain parents find
themselves in nursing homes against their will.
 &HT;    It is especially so when the murky questions of behavior and
psychology are raised: Is it adolescent moodiness or pre-Columbine
sociopathy? Was she born that way or did we make her that way?
 &HT;    The theoretical basis of family therapy _ and common sense _
holds that the most vulnerable point in the family structure will
reveal its stress first. And the way children show stress is often
called ``symptoms.'' Parents, of course, do not always wish to
interpret the symptoms, nor are family doctors always trained to
read them. Even well-intentioned parents who wish to make things
better, quickly, may override their child's experience and capacity
to express it.
 &HT;    For American children right now _ especially the fidgety, the
distractible and the extra-lively _ their vulnerability is made
worse by a ghastly convergence of social anxiety, overwhelmed and
uninspired schools and widespread fixation on the bottom line.
 &HT;    Find a symptom, find a treatment, treat it and, in a modern
twist, make it no one's fault. Fix them, we say.
 &HT;    And these new drugs do ``fix'' them _ quickly, inexpensively and
inappropriately. We fix them at a younger and younger age _ these
days even when they're toddlers. And we do so even when we use
medications intended for adults. As a result, 4 million children
are on Ritalin and 2.5 million are on antidepressants.
 &HT;    Attention deficit disorder and hyperactive disorder (both
formerly known as minimal brain damage, but nicely renamed by the
drug companies) do exist, and it would be cruel to withhold Ritalin
from children who suffer from them. Just as it would be unfair to
stigmatize them as spoiled brats and ridiculous to blame their
concerned parents.
 &HT;    But these drugs are being wildly prescribed because they are
cheaper and less time-consuming than psychotherapy and much easier
to sell, both to the consumer and to the average family doctor.
Prescriptions are less work than conversation and careful
evaluation. And handing out medication at lunchtime is easier than
creating classes that keep intelligent and curious kids from
squirming, daydreaming and talking back.
 &HT;    Most of all, we prescribe medications for children who don't
need them because the medications are available, and a cure for
parental vanity and irresponsibility _ along with the single-minded
greed of HMOs _ is not.
 -0- 
 &HT;    A couple come into my office. They tell me they are happily
married and need only a consult on their child, who is ``out of
control.''
 &HT;    The husband says that he is a fair disciplinarian (although it
seems to me that it must be difficult to get much disciplining done
between his arrival home at 8 p.m. and the child's bedtime at 8:15)
and that the mother, full time at home, is a pushover who can
neither keep to a schedule nor follow through with suitable
consequences. She says that he has no idea what he is talking
about, since he is never home, and that he makes unreasonable
demands on her and their 6-year-old.
 &HT;    I suggest that their family is both under stress and producing
it. They cancel the next appointment.
 &HT;    They call a year later. Their daughter is on Ritalin because of
Attention Deficit Disorder, which is now official, and the kids
make fun of her for the daily trip to the nurse. Can I suggest
someone who will help boost her self-esteem?

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: THE CLOCKS TICK FOR MICROSOFT
 &HT;    Moving in (k) commentary and (f) financial categories for
release
 &HT;    Sunday, March 19.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two clocks tick away for Microsoft, the world's
most valued corporation.
</P>
<P>
   One clock hangs on an opulent oak-paneled wall in Chicago's
Lawyers Club. The club serves as a neutral meeting ground in the
ongoing battle between the software giant and government
trust-busters.
</P>
<P>
   The other clock hangs in the modest chambers of U.S. District
Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson on the second floor of the federal
courthouse in Washington. There, Jackson is busily drafting a
ruling that almost surely will find Microsoft guilty of flouting
the nation's antitrust laws.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's clock is a legal time bomb, set to go off within the
next few weeks. It can be defused only if the talks in Chicago,
prodded along by a senior federal judge, yield a negotiated
settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Periodic rumors that a deal is in works cause Microsoft's stock
to bounce upward, a fair sign of how Wall Street would react should
the company succeed in lifting the antitrust monkey off its back.
</P>
<P>
   But a ruling from Jackson would force Microsoft to fend off a
raft of private civil suits, which could carry triple damages. The
plaintiffs would hold the high ground, armed with the presumption
that the wealthy defendant had broken the law.
</P>
<P>
   Later on, Jackson would still have to decide how to penalize
Microsoft for its bad behavior. Since most judges would prefer to
duck the chore of regulating a business _ the telephone company
breakup was an exception _ Jackson is most likely to opt for a
so-called structural solution.
</P>
<P>
   That would mean splitting Microsoft into two or more parts. One
perhaps would sell the Windows operating system, while another
marketed Microsoft programs that run on Windows, such as Word.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be just plain nuts,'' said T.J. Rodgers, the
founder of Cypress Semiconductor, a $6 billion Silicon Valley firm.
``That would mean,'' Rogers noted, ``trying to divide millions of
lines of computer code that have been written to work seamlessly
together.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodgers has never met Bill Gates, Microsoft's founder and the
world's richest entrepreneur. But he's happy to sell him, at 85
cents a pop, the tiny computer chips that act as the brains of each
intelligent Microsoft mouse.
</P>
<P>
   Although Gates has stepped down as Microsoft's chief executive
officer, he takes an active interest in seeking to settle the case.
Gates talks often with the mediator, Richard Posner, the chief
judge of the U.S. 7th Circuit Court of Appeals, and he has gone to
Chicago at least twice for face-to-face exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   There was a time, shortly before the case was filed in 1998,
that the Justice Department would have gladly gone away if only
Gates would have agreed to publish his prices, drop his exclusive
contracts and let rival Netscape attach its browser to the
installed Windows package.
</P>
<P>
   But two years later, the price of any deal that the government
would buy has risen steeply. Microsoft would probably be better off
striking a bargain _ even a harsh one _ to skirt further protracted
litigation. But at this point it's by no means certain that it can
keep Jackson's clock from ticking off its fate.

   MAPLE-SYRUP (Whitingham, Vt.) _ Early spring quickens in this
state's southern mountain hamlets with the first rising curls of
wood smoke from roadside sugar houses and the sweet fragrance of
newly boiled amber maple syrup served pure and plain in thin paper
cups. Unlike a winery, a sugar house gets just one chance a year to
prove the mettle of its maple with fresh tastings for amateur
connoisseurs: for only about 45 days in the spring, when the nights
are cold and the days are warm enough to coax the sap to flow. And
it is a fleeting opportunity for tourists to experience the
small-town spell of a pancake breakfast flapped by the local Lions
or an afternoon luncheon or ham supper prepared a la maple by
groups like the Ladies Benevolent Society of Whitingham or the E-Z
Riders Snowmobile Club. Vermont is, after all, the top producer of
maple syrup in the United States, with 370,000 gallons last year,
or more than a third of all the maple syrup in the country. By

   PEOPLES-SYMPHONY (new York) _ The most persistent complaint
among potential classical music listeners _ and regular
concertgoers as well _ is that ticket prices for the best-known
ensembles and soloists are so high as to discourage
experimentation. But there are venues that offer knowledgeable
listeners superb music at budget prices. One of the most notable is
the Peoples' Symphony Concerts, which for a century have been
giving knowledgeable listeners a break. Founded in 1900 by Franz X.
Arens, an immigrant conductor who found high ticket prices
objectionable even then, Peoples' Symphony these days presents
mostly recitals and chamber music in a schedule balanced between
established performers and promising newcomers. This season, the
Juilliard, Guarneri and Colorado String Quartets and the pianists
Ignat Solzehnitsyn and Orli Shaham have already appeared on the
series. Tickets now cost dollars rather than pennies, but the
prices remain remarkably low. A subscription to six Saturday
evening concerts costs $19, with single tickets going for $5. By

   The  &UR; New York Times News Service &LR;  is planning an expanded
weather package, with a planned starting date of Monday, March 20,
to be transmitted Sunday, March 19. The package, consisting of a
weather map as a graphics file and a text file to accompany the
map, is available to graphics clients of the News Service.
</P>
<P>
   The new map grows to 4 columns in width (52 picas), from 3, and
is 6 inches deep; the old was 4\ inches deep. This new size permits
the insertion of cloud cover information, previously a separate
map, and the addition of many new cities (see list below).
</P>
<P>
   The map is available both in color and in black and white.
Because the map is much more detailed, we have devised an entirely
new palette of colors to make it easier to read the added
information.
</P>
<P>
   A sample of the new map is available at Wieck, Newscom,
Presslink and AP's GraphicsNet.
</P>
<P>
   Some papers using the old map may need extra time to make the
transition to a 4-column format. We will, for a limited time,
produce a 3-col version of the new map, but with only some of the
new map's additional cities.
</P>
<P>
   A summary of this information is included in each day's Graphics
Budget.

 &HT;    AMERICA MAY BE HEADING FOR A GREAT TECH DIVIDE

release Sunday, March 19.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Americans, always eager for a better life, picked
up and moved in two great waves in the last century. First,
millions left the farm for the city. Then, after World War II,
masses abandoned cities for the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as a new century begins, another great migration may be
under way: millions are heading for the nation's high-tech hotbeds.
These booming cities, such as San Jose, Seattle, Atlanta, Los
Angeles, Austin and others, are attracting both foreign immigrants
and young domestic migrants who want to go where new technologies
are generating jobs.
</P>
<P>
   These cities tend to be clustered in a handful of states,
including California, Texas, New York, Massachusetts, Washington
and Georgia. In those states, the populations are becoming more
ethnically diverse and entrepreneurial. The younger residents of
these fast-paced tech centers are having children, starting
businesses and leading the global economy.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in the rest of the country, the population is getting
older. With more than 70 million baby boomers inching closer to
retirement, most states will see a surge in senior citizens
starting in 2011, when the youngest boomers hit 65. As more boomers
die off, the population of many states will decline.
</P>
<P>
   These demographic trends mean that the United States may be
starting to split into two nations. One country, Tech America, will
have 10 to 15 states, each characterized by its youth,
multi-cultural diversity and entrepreneurial zeal. The other
country, Traditional America, will be older, whiter and less
prosperous.
</P>
<P>
   Politically, the impact of that divergence is hard to predict.
Perhaps the residents of Traditional America will be satisfied
living in the shadow of Tech America. Maybe they will appreciate
the wealth being generated in the go-go states, wealth that will
fund Social Security and Medicare and hold down tax rates.
</P>
<P>
   But younger workers in Tech America may resent seeing so much of
their income going to the gray heads living elsewhere. Even today,
the Social Security tax is the single largest tax for most workers.
In the future, young tech workers may want to see more of their tax
dollars going toward education and road building. They may want
more open immigration laws and bigger free trade zones than
Traditional America would like.
</P>
<P>
   Political arguments over how to use scarce government resources
``used to be split between Democratic cities and Republican
suburbs,'' said William Frey, a demographer and senior fellow at
the Milken Institute, a research group here. In the 21st century,
``the divisions will be between the 'melting pot' and the
'heartland' states,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Frey was among those presenting data at the Milken Institute
2000 Global Conference here this month, which focused on economic
and demographic changes around the world.
</P>
<P>
   A theme that emerged was that while new technologies can lead to
higher standards of living for everyone, the relative gap between
tech-haves and tech-nots is widening, whether on a global level or
at home.
</P>
<P>
   Countries with high levels of education, sophisticated
telecommunications systems and abundant computers tend to be far
richer than those without such advantages. For example, North
America is one of the wealthiest places on Earth, and it's also the
most wired. In 1999, about 57 percent of Americans and Canadians
had access to the Internet, either at home, in school or at work.
Meanwhile, in Africa, the world's poorest continent, only about 1
percent of the population had Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, economists at the conference were cheery about
the financial prospects for tech-laden North Americans. But on the
African continent, ``optimism is hard to find,'' a Milken Institute
study concluded.
</P>
<P>
   While the digital divide is widening between nations, gaps also
exist within countries. Heavily wired cities such as Atlanta, San
Francisco, Austin, San Jose, Seattle, Washington D.C., Boston and
Dallas have booming economies and surging populations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Technology and immigration tend to complement each other,''
Frey said. When tech companies start growing quickly, they draw
both young domestic migrants seeking high-paying jobs and
low-skilled foreign workers. Most immigrants are not educated
enough to take tech jobs, but they flock to tech centers anyway, he
said, because boom towns ``need more people to do service work,
like nannies and gardeners.''
</P>
<P>
   Not every tech center draws foreigners, he noted. Cities such as
Ann Arbor, Mich., and Raleigh, N.C., have tech-led economies, but
lack large numbers of immigrants. But those cities draw other young
people, such as college students, who can fill service jobs.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, though, cities with fast-growing technology
companies are attracting both young Americans and foreign workers.
For example, between 1990 and 1998, metro Atlanta drew 440,668 new
residents, as well as 68,515 immigrants, according to Milken
Institute data.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in parts of the Midwest and New England, populations
have been stagnant or even declining. In North Dakota between 1990
and 1998, the population fell slightly as young people moved away.
The percentage of the state's population over age 65 rose to 14.4,
compared with Georgia's 9.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   States with rapidly aging populations include Iowa, Kansas,
Maine, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota and West Virginia.
Those states have few tech hot spots within their borders. But the
states with relatively young populations, such as Utah, Texas,
Georgia, New Mexico and California, have booming technology
centers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The places attracting both immigrants and domestic migrants
are doing so because of their dynamic economies,'' Frey said.
``What that translates into is younger people with greater needs
for education and consumer markets.'' In other words, residents of
these states will need more schools for their families, more roads
for their shopping centers and more global connections.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Tech America will coalesce to create a powerful voting
bloc remains to be seen. But last week, a bipartisan group of 18
members of Congress gave a hint of what may be coming. The
lawmakers representing high-tech districts in California, Texas,
Virginia, Washington state and Georgia joined forces to push for a
sharp increase in visas for highly skilled foreign workers.
</P>
<P>
   While traditional labor groups oppose immigration to fill U.S.
jobs, the high-tech House members are sponsoring legislation to
boost to 200,000 the number of visas granted each year to
well-educated foreigners such as engineers and computer
programmers. That would be up from 107,500 currently allowed for
2001. Among the supporters were bedrock conservatives as well as
liberals, united in the belief that their tech-heavy states will
benefit from more immigration.
</P>
<P>
   As Rep. Lloyd Doggett, a Democrat from Austin, said, tech
companies need to attract ``the best and brightest, not only from
all over the country, but from all over the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether Traditional Americans may eventually feel run over by
hard-charging Tech Americans could shape the political battles of
the early 21st century.

`CHANGING FACE OF BEAUTY' EXAMINES STANDARDS OF POP CULTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A 28-year-old model, staggeringly pretty and impossibly youthful
by any reasonable standard, comes across as too old to be on the
cover of Self magazine. The 17-year-old who gets the job admits
that even she feels past her prime.
</P>
<P>
   Question: If the coyly named Self is using 17-year-olds to sell
its slickly packaged secret to personal well-being, what's the
cutoff age for being on the cover of Seventeen magazine? Worse,
does this mean AARP should start recruiting women when they hit 29?
</P>
<P>
   We know better than that. Don't we?
</P>
<P>
   ``The Changing Face of Beauty'' purports to tell us that we do
indeed, but the hopeful-sounding title doesn't always mesh with the
reality of the hourlong program premiering Sunday on Lifetime
Television. As executive producer and host Sela Ward says in
discussing that elusive thing called beauty: ``It supposedly comes
in all shapes, sizes and colors. But is that really what we
believe, what we're teaching our kids?''
</P>
<P>
   Ward, a model who became an actress in her mid-20s, knows the
answer. Her own ``moment of truth'' came six years ago when she was
auditioning for a James Bond movie. With all the delicacy of a
karate chop from Odd Job, the producers told her they were really
looking for the Sela Ward of 10 years before.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was only 38,'' she says, ``and I felt young and sexy. But in
that moment I understood why a woman might feel driven to lie about
her age or get a facelift. It may sound crazy, but that moment
changed my life. It's what made me want to make this film, to
explore the ways in which these rigid standards of beauty impact
our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Surely it will take more than a one-hour cable documentary to
abolish the unrealistic standards perpetuated by American pop
culture, but ``The Changing Face of Beauty'' is a start. Especially
with Ward as its flag bearer.
</P>
<P>
   As one who has traded on her looks for most of her career, Ward
knows well that Hollywood and Madison Avenue view wrinkles and gray
hair with the same enthusiasm they have for overweight people. But
thanks to the happy accident of intelligent casting and gutsy
programming, Ward is also striking a blow as star of the ABC series
``Once and Again,'' in which she plays _ surprise! _ a woman not
far from her own age. (She'll be 44 in July.) It's one of a handful
of new series _ ``The West Wing,'' ``Family Law'' and ``Judging
Amy'' are others _ that don't rely on thirtysomething actresses to
play twentysomething characters, or twentysomethings to play teens.
</P>
<P>
   It is way too soon to label it a trend, but if all four shows
survive into a second season, count on the networks coming back
with more new series featuring adults old enough to remember black
and white TV.
</P>
<P>
   But will this lead to older faces appearing on magazine covers,
and to 50- and 60-year-old actors dating women closer to their own
ages in big-budget movies?
</P>
<P>
   Without mentioning specifics, such as her own series, Ward
suggests that the images of women are indeed starting to grow up.
But her fate as a performer, she knows, isn't entirely in her
hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``These things are run by corporations,'' she said last summer,
``and it's about the bottom line.'' Then she added: ``It's all
about what we, as the public, support, and what we don't.''
</P>
<P>
   That's where ``The Changing Face of Beauty'' comes in. At one
point in the documentary, Ward asks, ``Who sets these rules and why
are we following them?''
</P>
<P>
   The question is as much rhetorical as anything. But it's
answered eloquently by people like Jen Shallo, who battled anorexia
from age 12 to age 15, and by Diane Keaton, one of the few
Hollywood actresses who still has a viable career after age 40, and
by Frances Alenikoff, a 79-year-old dancer who believes she's never
been more beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   Produced by Rory Kennedy and Liz Garbus, ``The Changing Face of
Beauty,'' won't make anyone gasp in horror at the inequities and
unrealistic expectations promulgated by magazines, movies and TV
shows. We assume those are a given.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they offer a thoughtful, wide-ranging presentation with
seemingly conflicting messages. For example, there's Phyllis
Levine, an editor at Self, who says the line between real and ideal
is a tightrope. ``You always hear from your readers that they want
things to look natural, that models are too thin, models are too
made up, models are too perfect,'' she says. ``And the second you
don't retouch, then you get letters saying this woman is too heavy
or this woman's not pretty, or why does she have so many wrinkles?
It's quite a dilemma.''
</P>
<P>
   And there's Faye Wattleton, director of the Center for Gender
Equality, who happily admits to having had plastic surgery. ``This
is not the face of a 50-year-old without some help,'' she laughs.
``The injustice is when we deny it, because it doesn't give other
women permission that this is an acceptable decision for them. I
suspect it is healthier for us to look good and to perceive that we
look good.''
</P>
<P>
   The film's thesis _ that the answer to the beauty question is
different for every woman _ could be much stronger, but Ward offers
a rational valediction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I refuse to be frightened by something as normal and natural
as getting older,'' she says, ``because I'm not just an actress,
I'm also a mom, and I don't want my daughter to measure her worth
by how thin she is or how young. I want her to learn what we all
seem to keep forgetting, that beauty, real beauty, really does come
from within.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure, it's a hackneyed expression. But the thing about cliches
is that they're usually true.
</P>
<P>
   The Changing Face of Beauty. One-hour documentary exploring
society's standards of feminine attractiveness. Hosted by Sela
Ward. Sunday night on Lifetime Television. Repeats Tuesday, March
24, March 25. Parental guideline rating: TV-PG.

DO YOU REALLY NEED TO USE PREMIUM GASOLINE? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For many of you, the recent news stories about gasoline brought
back ugly memories of the long lines of cars in the 1970s, when
drivers waited in those lines to pay exhorbitant amounts of money
for gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   And now, the stories warn, we are in the midst of another
explosion in gasoline prices. Some say prices may hit $1.85 or even
$2 per gallon by this summer, the peak travel season. Even now,
we're paying $1.65 and higher for premium gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   Many of you buy premium gasoline because that is what your car
requires and, hey, it hasn't been that expensive anyway. Others
burn premium, even though their cars can handle regular, because
they think it improves their car's performance or gives better gas
mileage or helps keep the engine clean, or is better for the
environment.
</P>
<P>
   But now many are asking themselves if they should keep pumping
the high test into their cars, or if they should save money and use
a lower grade of fuel.
</P>
<P>
   It's a fair question _ oddly, AAA estimates that only 5 percent
of the cars sold in the United States require premium gasoline, yet
20 percent of the gasoline sold is premium _ and it's a question
that's all about octane.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of people think octane somehow is directly related to
power obtained from the fuel you burn; that 92 octane, say, somehow
gives your car more power than 87. Octane, however, is not a
measure of power.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, octane measures how resistant a grade of fuel is to
combustion. And it might surprise you to know that the lower the
octane level, the more combustible the fuel. But doesn't combustion
equal power? Not by itself.
</P>
<P>
   And here's where octane comes in. Some engine basics: An engine
generates power when fuel and air are mixed in the cylinder,
compressed by the piston, and detonated by the spark plug.
</P>
<P>
   Compress the mixture tighter _ high-compression engines _ and
you get a more even, explosive burn. These are the engines that
require high-octane (harder to detonate) gasoline. Why?
</P>
<P>
   Because in the process of compression, it is possible for the
mixture to detonate by heat or friction before the spark plug
fires. This sends a screaming fireball upward in the cylinder. But
before that fireball consumes all the mixture, the spark plug
fires, and another screaming fireball goes in the other direction.
The piston, riding the engine's inertia, pushes up through the
downward explosion before beginning its descent.
</P>
<P>
   This is the phenomenon that causes loud pings and knocks. It can
burn a hole in a piston, wreak havoc with your engine. It is a very
bad thing.
</P>
<P>
   Lower-compression engines are set to fire their spark plugs
earlier in the compression process, so lower-octane fuel (easier to
detonate) is no problem for them.
</P>
<P>
   So, faced with rocketing gasoline costs, what do you do?
</P>
<P>
   John Paul, a spokesman for AAA in New England, has simple
advice: Read your owner's manual and follow it.
</P>
<P>
   Gasoline comes in three grades, for the most part: regular, 87;
midgrade, 89; and premium, 92 or 93.
</P>
<P>
   Burn what the manual tells you to burn.
</P>
<P>
   If you put lower-grade fuel in a high-compression engine, you
are endangering the engine. And in summer, when ambient
temperatures are higher, the octane requirements of all engines are
a bit higher, so it is even more critical then.
</P>
<P>
   And not only will you endanger your engine, you will also
probably get worse performance and worse gasoline mileage.
</P>
<P>
   But what if you drive a car that can run on 87 or 89, but are
using 92 or 93 for better performance, to help keep your engine
clean, or because it is better for the environment?
</P>
<P>
   You might as well take that extra money and give it to the next
squeegee man who puts his face in your windshield and wipes it with
a dirty rag with one hand while he holds out the other.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Trade Commission says that, as a rule, high octane
does not out-perform regular octane in helping to remove engine
deposits or keep your engine cleaner. All grades of gasoline must
contain engine-cleaning additives, so the additive you get at $1.85
per gallon is likely the same you'll get at $1.50.
</P>
<P>
   And if your concerns are environmental, consider that it takes
far more energy to produce high-octane gasoline at the refinery
than it does to produce regular.
</P>
<P>
   So here's the octane rule to live by: If your car does not knock
or ping on 87 or 89, that's what you should run. You're wasting
money running higher-octane gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   If your owner's manual says you need premium gasoline, use
premium gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   That settled, Paul, of AAA, has a couple of other tips for you:
</P>
<P>
   Make sure your tires are inflated properly. Millions of gallons
of gasoline are wasted every year in engines powering vehicles on
improperly inflated tires.
</P>
<P>
   ``And, hey,'' Paul says in a blast from the '70s, ``you could
always car pool. Two people in a car doubles the gas mileage.''
</P>
<P>
   About gasoline mileage figures
</P>
<P>
   I read in my newspaper's Ombudsman's report last Monday that a
reader was concerned I do not list EPA estimates for gasoline
mileage in my car review columns.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody asked me, but it reminded me of a great line from a Dan
Jenkins book, ``Baja Oklahoma,'' in which a woman wanders into a
bar and finds her husband seated in a chair with a young woman on
his lap. ``Who you gonna believe _ me or your own eyes?'' the
culprit responds.
</P>
<P>
   I don't use EPA estimates because I don't need to. They are
estimates, they are broad, they do not factor in real-life uses for
vehicles other than highway or city (and how many of us drive
exclusively in either situation?).
</P>
<P>
   Here's what I do: drive cars, which have been broken in before I
get them, between 800 and 1,000 miles each week. I haul kids to
soccer, garbage to the recycling center, myself in and out of
Boston on the interstate. I put them through snow, mud, water, on
country roads, fine highways.
</P>
<P>
   And when I am done, I figure what each vehicle got for gas
mileage and I include that figure in each of my reviews.
</P>
<P>
   No estimate. Just what my own eyes tell me.

TOYOTA LAND CRUISER _ A BLEND OF RUGGEDNESS AND SMOOTHNESS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You are a builder of rugged, off-road vehicles. For nearly half
a century, you introduced yourself to drivers not only in
developing countries, where the phrase ``off-road driving'' was a
redundancy, but also in the United States, where you foresaw
off-road driving as the chosen but coming thing.
</P>
<P>
   You are Toyota, you have sold your Land Cruiser on these shores
since 1957 and, for many years, your customers wanted off-road
capabilities, highway performance be damned.
</P>
<P>
   That was then, this is now.
</P>
<P>
   And now means melding that stiff, jarring, but oh-so-much-fun
capability in an oxymoronic amalgam that adds quiet luxury. How to
pummel granite to pumice without spilling that latte?
</P>
<P>
   In the 2000 Land Cruiser _ fifth generation born in late 1998
and with antiskid capabilities this year's added feature _ Toyota
has done as well as any manufacturer in combining rugged, proven
off-road performance with subtle highway smoothness and quiet.
</P>
<P>
   The basic box that first came here as the soft-top, limited
horsepower, two-door FJ25, became Toyota's best-selling model by
the early to mid-'60s. The 1972 Land Cruiser _ first car I ever
bought brand new, for a whopping $1,995 _ was pure box. Two bucket
seats up front (lift the seats to reveal storage bins), two facing
fold-down seats in the rear, manual hubs up front, a long-stroke
six for an engine, and the essence of escape imbued throughout. I
am convinced that, without the nostalgia with which these early
'70s Land Cruisers seduced today's baby boomers, SUVs would have
been a harder sell.
</P>
<P>
   But, oh, how they have changed.
</P>
<P>
   It was in the 1980s that all Land Cruisers became four-door and
the two-door died (bring it back, please). The automatic
transmission and (gulp) air conditioning soon followed. By 1995, it
was a full-blown yuppie-mobile, favored by sports stars and the
nouveau riche.
</P>
<P>
   But even then, outer skin and bigger size aside, it had not
fully evolved. It still had solid axle suspension, which made it
suspect on road and off, a frame that could be stiffer, and a
six-cylinder engine that, while capable, was being left behind as
other upscale SUVs hit the market.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to today.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the Toyota Tundra, the first big-truck (read V8)
Japanese product to challenge US manufacturers, was still a gleam
in some designer's eye, Toyota dropped a version of the Lexus V8
into the Land Cruiser.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, it added a stiffer, nine-crossmember frame. Torsional
rigidity went up, and, with the addition of front suspension that
added double wishbones, trailer arms and a stabilizer bar, and a
4-link rear setup that includes coil springs and a stabilizer bar,
handling went from mystifying to quietly subtle.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, it still looks like a stiff box _ albeit with rounded
corners. Its flared fenders give it a muscular crouch that befits
what it will really do. Integrated fog lights and color-coordinated
front and rear bumpers and side moldings are in keeping with what
is essentially an understated look.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, the jammed interior seating is long gone. Up front, firm
leather buckets support you thigh, side, and back. The middle
seats, which split 60/40, are also firm and leather and hold three
adults with plenty of support and room. In the rear cargo area, a
three-person _ as in children _ bench seat unfolds in halves from
opposing walls. This means you can carry eight people, but with
those rear seats in use, there is no room for gear. In the front
rows, room is more than ample and headroom abounds.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the cabin, there are myriad storage bins and slots
and pockets. Every seat has a cupholder, which will please
aficionados of the where-do-I-put-my-bottle-of-water school.
</P>
<P>
   Controls are large and accessible, and I was impressed with the
size of even the secondary buttons for the audio system.
</P>
<P>
   So you ride in comfort and convenience, but you also ride in
safety. This is, after all its permutations, a very safe rig. Dual
air bags up front, side-impact door beams. Four-wheel, antilock
disc brakes bring its two-tons-plus to quick, straight stops. ABS
and antiskid aid this, of course.
</P>
<P>
   On the highway _ previously the Land Cruiser's terrain of
inconvenience _ it was smooth, supple, and surprisingly quiet.
That's because the straining 6 is gone and the Lexus-based V8 has
replaced it.
</P>
<P>
   In its earlier incarnation, it was the Lexus 4.0. Here, it's the
4.7-liter, 32-valve version _ delivering just over 15 miles per
gallon, much of that travel spent fully loaded with people and ski
gear. Coupled with a 4-speed electronically controlled
transmission, it is sedan quiet and smooth on the highway (and so
like the Tundra pickup truck) that a blindfolded rider would be
hardpressed to say in what type of vehicle they were riding.
</P>
<P>
   I remember my first Land Cruiser (and wish I had it back);
remember a New Year's Eve when we took it up a rough road to a
tower atop a New Hampshire mountain and then down no defined road
and, miraculously at the time, safely home. I suspect, swathed in
leather and luxury, I could do the same with this year's model, and
that says something for both tradition and evolution.
</P>
<P>
   Nice touches
</P>
<P>
   --The air system that runs through the ceiling. Great use of
normally unused space.
</P>
<P>
   --The easy-to-grab triangular grips that help you hoist yourself
out of the rear seats.
</P>
<P>
   Annoyances
</P>
<P>
   --The lack of space in the console bin between the front seats.
I'm not sure why this varies so much from manufacturer to
manufacturer.

<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. JOY: Please give me some guidance. I can't call your
radio show because my husband listens to you every day. I'm afraid
he would recognize my voice and circumstance.
</P>
<P>
   In your view, what role should a stepparent play in disciplining
a child? My husband and I have been married for four years _ the
second marriage for each of us. I have a daughter who was 9 when we
married and is now almost 13. My husband had been married for 17
years and had no children. I am 45, he is 49.
</P>
<P>
   My husband and I have totally different styles of parenting. He
thinks I am too lax, and I think he is often too petty. What is
happening is that I am starting to get very angry and resentful
when he criticizes my daughter _ she is a good girl, great student,
cute, etc. She is beginning to hate him because she thinks he runs
our home like a military state. I feel that way, too. He seems to
be putting her life under a microscope and is critical of me when I
don't ``call'' my child on what I deem ``unimportant'' issues.
</P>
<P>
   I am a teacher and pride myself on doing an excellent job with
my child prior to getting remarried. My daughter now tries to avoid
my husband and she spends a lot of time in her room. When we were
dating my husband gave me the impression that he really liked my
child and wanted to have a happy family unit. Now I feel as if he
really doesn't like children at all _ even my daughter _ and I'm
stuck in the middle. Is there a way to restore family harmony? _ M.
</P>
<P>
   DR. JOY: If your husband listens to my radio show, he knows that
I think the role of a stepparent is to be a good friend and good
host _ not a disciplinarian, warden or judge.
</P>
<P>
   It seems that your husband doesn't try and discipline your
daughter _ which is good. But he seems critical of her, which makes
you chagrined. I understand why you might feel upset by this.
However, he should be allowed to have an opinion as long as he
doesn't try to discipline her.
</P>
<P>
   You may recall from your own childhood that _ especially during
adolescence _ parents don't always agree on a child's behavior. And
adolescents avoiding their parents _ either biological or step _ is
not unusual.
</P>
<P>
   The situation sounds like much more of a marital _ rather than a
parenting _ issue. Maybe the two of you could find a marriage
counselor and sort out what's going on here. It's unclear whether
your husband feels competitive with your daughter for your time and
attention, or whether he is being completely critical of her. It's
important for both of you to know.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of his behavior before you were married, he probably
did like your daughter. Living with somebody on a day-to-day basis
is completely different from seeing them occasionally when everyone
is on their best behavior. Don't give up on this one but do seek
some marriage counseling.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR. DR. JOY: My husband and I have a dispute that comes up
every few months. When we ground our children, my husband also
believes that they should not participate in organized team
sporting events. I believe that since the children have committed
to be a part of a team they shouldn't be forced to let the team
down.
</P>
<P>
   I do concur that they should not participate in team snacks,
team parties, etc. However, I want my children to show up, fulfill
their commitment to the team, and then come straight home. What do
you think? We agreed in advance to abide by your response. _ C. and
M.
</P>
<P>
   DR. JOY: I would suggest that the person who grounds the child _
for whatever reason _ determines the perimeters. For example, if
you ground the child, they are allowed to go to sporting events. If
your husband grounds them, they cannot attend.
</P>
<P>
   We have this notion as parents that we must be monolithic and
agree across the board on all matters. That is not realistic. Our
job as parents does not require us to be in constant agreement, but
we must agree not to undermine each other's decisions.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, if your husband grounds them and says they can't
go to a sporting event, you can't go and plead their cause. You
have to accept his ruling in this particular case. Conversely, if
you ground your children, but allow them to attend team sporting
events, he is not allowed to undermine your position.
</P>
<P>
   If you think about it, your parents, like mine, didn't always
agree on exactly what the punishment should be. As long as you
don't undermine each other, your kids will survive your differences
in parenting.
</P>

largest agricultural companies have formed a line of defense

   MAPLE-SYRUP (Whitingham, Vt.) _ Early spring quickens in this
state's southern mountain hamlets with the first rising curls of
wood smoke from roadside sugar houses and the sweet fragrance of
newly boiled amber maple syrup served pure and plain in thin paper
cups. Unlike a winery, a sugar house gets just one chance a year to
prove the mettle of its maple with fresh tastings for amateur
connoisseurs: for only about 45 days in the spring, when the nights
are cold and the days are warm enough to coax the sap to flow. And
it is a fleeting opportunity for tourists to experience the
small-town spell of a pancake breakfast flapped by the local Lions
or an afternoon luncheon or ham supper prepared a la maple by
groups like the Ladies Benevolent Society of Whitingham or the E-Z
Riders Snowmobile Club. Vermont is, after all, the top producer of
maple syrup in the United States, with 370,000 gallons last year,
or more than a third of all the maple syrup in the country. By

   PEOPLES-SYMPHONY (new York) _ The most persistent complaint
among potential classical music listeners _ and regular
concertgoers as well _ is that ticket prices for the best-known
ensembles and soloists are so high as to discourage
experimentation. But there are venues that offer knowledgeable
listeners superb music at budget prices. One of the most notable is
the Peoples' Symphony Concerts, which for a century have been
giving knowledgeable listeners a break. Founded in 1900 by Franz X.
Arens, an immigrant conductor who found high ticket prices
objectionable even then, Peoples' Symphony these days presents
mostly recitals and chamber music in a schedule balanced between
established performers and promising newcomers. This season, the
Juilliard, Guarneri and Colorado String Quartets and the pianists
Ignat Solzehnitsyn and Orli Shaham have already appeared on the
series. Tickets now cost dollars rather than pennies, but the
prices remain remarkably low. A subscription to six Saturday
evening concerts costs $19, with single tickets going for $5. By
Allan Kozinn.

   ATTENTION GRAPHICS EDITORS -- WEATHER CHANGE ADVISORY:
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times News Service is planning an expanded weather
package, with a planned starting date of Monday, March 20, to be
transmitted Sunday, March 19. The package, consisting of a weather
map as a graphics file and a text file to accompany the map, is
available to graphics clients of the News Service.
</P>
<P>
   The new map grows to 4 columns in width (52 picas), from 3, and
is 6 inches deep; the old was 4 inches deep. This new size permits
the insertion of cloud cover information, previously a separate
map, and the addition of many new cities.
</P>
<P>
   The map is available both in color and in black and white.
Because the map is much more detailed, we have devised an entirely
new palette of colors to make it easier to read the added
information.
</P>
<P>
   A sample of the new map is available at Wieck, Newscom,
Presslink and AP's GraphicsNet.
</P>
<P>
   Some papers using the old map may need extra time to make the
transition to a 4-column format. We will, for a limited time,
produce a 3-col version of the new map, but with only some of the
new map's additional cities.

 &HT;    It's all Irish to me when it comes to beer
 &HT;    By Amy Kincheloe
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Erin Go Braugh _ Ireland Forever!
</P>
<P>
   St. Patrick's Day is here _ let the celebration begin. But what
is everybody celebrating on this day?
</P>
<P>
   According to Suzanne Barrett with the ``Ireland for Visitors''
guide at www.about.com, St. Patrick's Day in Ireland is a day to
honor Saint Patrick, the country's patron saint who purportedly
drove all the snakes out of Ireland, not the loud and rowdy
beerfest that it has come to be in America.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Irish version is primarily a religious and bank holiday,
celebrated by relaxing at home with family and friends after
Mass,'' Barrett said.
</P>
<P>
   But in America, St. Patrick's Day is often celebrated with
parades, festivals and, of course, drink.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes that drink is green beer _ a light, domestic beer
tinted green with food coloring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think green beer is strictly an American invention,''
laughed Kendall Garrison, consultant to the brewing industry and
instructor of a beer-tasting course at McLennan Community College.
``St. Patrick's Day is just a fun holiday _ the country is green,
so what could be more fun? On March 17, everyone's Irish.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``everyone's Irish'' attitude is what turns people out in
droves all over America to celebrate with a mug of tinted beer. The
idea of green beer seems to be in keeping with the tradition of
``wearin' o' the green,'' which, especially on St. Patrick's Day,
is considered to be both lucky and an act of paying respect to
Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   And even though green brew will be served in several area bars
and taverns, there are a couple of places that can be counted on to
not serve the beer with a Dennis Rodman dye job.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did it last year, but not this year,'' said Robert Donnell,
general manager of Cricket's Grill &AMP; Draft House in Waco. ``It's a
huge hassle, and food coloring stains the fingers. But we will have
deep green margaritas.''
</P>
<P>
   Scruffy Murphy's Irish Pub in Waco, which has traditionally put
on one of the biggest St. Patrick's Day celebrations in town and
expects well over 1,000 people throughout the day this year, won't
be serving green beer, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's an American tradition, not an Irish one,'' said Don
Stevenson, manager at Scruffy Murphy's. ``We still have people ask
for it, but we don't do it. One of our owners is Irish, and he
hates the idea of green beer.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea of green beer is somewhat of a joke to many Irish
people because it's not even close to the preferred beers of
Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Garrison said there are three different well-known examples of
Irish beers offered in the United States: Murphy's Irish Stout, a
dark beer with a creamy head; Harp Lager, a light, golden
lager-style beer; and Guinness Stout, a dry Irish stout with a
roasted-coffee flavor.
</P>
<P>
   ``All Irish beers are available here in the U.S.,'' Garrison
said. ``Everybody drinks them in Ireland. It's customary to have
one after work with friends or during a lunch break with friends.''
</P>
<P>
   And Garrison said most of Ireland drinks Guinness.
</P>
<P>
   ``They treat Guinness as a national treasure,'' Garrison said.
``Ireland and Guinness go hand-in-hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, these dark, robust beers are not everyone's cup of
tea, but since a few bars and restaurants in town have them on tap,
there must be some public interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guinness is pretty popular (at Scruffy Murphy's),'' Stevenson
said. ``Sometimes (people drink it) just for the novelty, but some
people actually do enjoy the taste.''
</P>
<P>
   Garrison added, ``There are people who really do enjoy those
styles of beer and drink them at times other than St. Patrick's
Day. The guy who drinks green beer is not the guy who drinks
Guinness.''
</P>
<P>
   But if the idea of green beer or any other beer from Ireland
doesn't suit your spirit this St. Patrick's Day, there are always
other options.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have bottled beer, so I don't have any kegs to dye green,''
said Gina Johnson, owner of The Grape in Waco, which opened in
June. ``So, I'll probably dye some bottles of white wine green. I
know traditionally it's green beer, but what the heck, we'll have
green wine. It'll be fun. This is our first St. Patrick's Day, so
we'll see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   As Garrison reminds everyone, to each his own on St. Patrick's
Day, because this is the one day that everyone's Irish.
</P>
<P>
   ``(On St. Patrick's Day) I've got to have a Guinness and a shot
of Bushmills Irish whisky, and that's what turns me into an
Irishman,'' Garrison said. ``You enjoy this holiday with your
friends. I'm not sure if St. Patrick actually drove the snakes from
Ireland, or if it's just an excuse for a beer-drinking holiday.''

&HT;     EMPTY RIGS HELP TURN TRADE ROUTES INTO SLOW HAULS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 &HT;     (For release Sunday, March 19)   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ALISON GREGOR  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROWNSVILLE, Texas _ A government study found that nearly half
of the tractor-trailer rigs crossing from Mexico into the United
States are empty, contributing to chronic traffic problems and
slowing the burgeoning flow of commerce across the border.
</P>
<P>
   But federal officials, wary of the drug trade and illegal
immigration, as well as vehicle safety, say they must inspect
commercial vehicles _ empty or not.
</P>
<P>
   In the report released last week, the General Accounting Office
said 1.7 million of the 3.6 million trucks that crossed the border
in 1998 were empty but still had to be cleared by U.S. Customs and
the Department of Transportation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lines of trucks _ many of which are empty _ waiting to enter
the United States can run up to several miles during peak periods
in the early to late afternoon'' at some border crossings, Benjamin
Nelson, the GAO director of international relations and trade, said
in the report. The GAO is the investigative branch of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The traffic also contributes to the air pollution, road wear and
public safety problems that plague border crossings, he said.
</P>
<P>
   James Giermanski, a Texas A&AMP;M International University professor
in Laredo, said there always will be an imbalance of trade
necessitating empty hauls. But the percentage of empty trailers
cited in the report _ 47 percent _ is high, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Reba, who oversees eight ports on the border for the U.S.
Customs Service, said agents have found drugs concealed in trucks.
``So even if it's empty we have to inspect it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Also, truck safety remains an issue despite efforts to improve
the flow of commerce under the 6-year-old North American Free Trade
Agreement that was signed by Canada, Mexico and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``The transportation department has to make sure the trucks are
safe, because we don't want to have an accident on the streets,''
Reba said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the GAO report, trucks handled 75 percent of the
$173 billion in trade between the United States and Mexico in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. policy restricts Mexican truckers to commercial zones no
further than 20 miles north of U.S border cities. Mexico, in turn,
has refused to allow U.S. trucks to travel to the interior of
Mexico. These policies have helped create a flourishing
``drayage,'' or short-haul, trucking industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some public and private officials have suggested that this
policy contributes to the high volume of empty trucks at the
border,'' the author of the GAO report said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is because much of the cross-border traffic is handled by
Mexican local firms that shuttle containers between warehouses
within the commercial zones on both sides of the border.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides the limited distance the truckers can go, officials
point to another reason why there are so many cargoless trucks
headed into the United States: American companies generally pay
more for shipping, giving drivers incentive to drop loads in Mexico
and return to the United States for more.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of it is economics, and a lot of it is they can't find a
shipment to take back'' into the United States, Reba said. ``For
the most part, the reason this (drayage) industry has developed is
trucks can't go to the interior of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   NAFTA was supposed to open the U.S. interior to Mexican truckers
four years ago. But U.S. authorities have raised questions about
the safety of Mexican trucks and their drivers.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the U.S. Department of Transportation reported that 44
percent of Mexican trucks inspected at the border were put out of
service until they could comply with safety regulations. The
out-of-service rate for U.S. trucks was 26 percent, and the rate
for Canadian trucks was 17 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In January, a Mexico-bound pasadero, or short-haul trucker, was
blamed for an accident that caused a chemical spill in Brownsville
that killed millions of fish. After the driver fled into Mexico, it
was discovered that he was uninsured and the brakes on his rig did
not work.
</P>
<P>
   The International Brotherhood of Teamsters has lobbied heavily
to prevent Mexican truckers from making further inroads into the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mexico has not yet made the changes necessary in their
transportation infrastructure to ensure that their drivers are
trained and safe drivers or that their vehicles are maintained and
inspected,'' said Bret Caldwell, a spokesman for the Teamsters.
</P>
<P>
   Also, studies have found there are not enough inspection
stations and employees to prevent unsafe Mexican trucks from
entering the United States. The only alternative right now is to
keep Mexican truckers out of the U.S. interior, Caldwell said.
</P>
<P>
   Caldwell said that if the United States is opened up to Mexican
tractor-trailer rigs, ``we believe there would be a greater loss of
life on highways, and it would be highest in South Texas, where you
have the highest amount of truck traffic going across the border.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Mexican truckers generally have a good safety
record in the border areas, according to some officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been very fortunate,'' Brownsville City Commissioner
John Wood said. ``I don't think we should just let everything and
anything go through, but we do need to promote commerce as much as
we can in a good, safe manner.''
</P>
<P>
   Giermanski said he doesn't believe a legitimate reason exists to
keep the interior closed, thereby allowing the drayage industry to
flourish.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ridiculous use of this form of motor carriage here is
really inefficient,'' he said. ``All it does is add costs to the
cargo. We don't do anything at the border except make it more
expensive. We don't add any value.''
</P>

<ANNOTATION>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Giermanski contends that comparing the condition of Mexican
drayage trucks to U.S. and Canadian long-haul trucks is specious.
</P>
<P>
   Another U.S. Department of Transportation report, this one
released in November 1999, inspected a small sampling of Mexican
long-haul trucks that were found traveling illegally in this
country.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 66 trucks found traveling in states other than the four
border states _ Arizona, California, New Mexico and Texas _ 15
percent of the vehicles and 17 percent of the drivers were put out
of service.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were almost twice as safe as U.S. trucks,'' Giermanski
said.
</P>
<P>
   He said U.S. and Canadian drayage trucks and truckers have
out-of-service rates similar to those of Mexico, and attempts to
keep Mexican trucks out of the United States are politically
motivated to protect the jobs of U.S. truckers.
</P>
<P>
   But Caldwell said the out-of-service rates for Mexican trucks
were so low in the study because ``local authorities did not
believe they had the right to put Mexican trucks out of service.''
</P>
<P>
   The Motor Carrier Safety Act of 1999 is an attempt to change
that, he said. It raises the U.S. safety standards for trucks and
severely penalizes Mexican trucks found traveling in the U.S.
interior.
</P>
<P>
   Caldwell did say there is a certain amount of protectionism
involved in the Teamsters position on cross-border trucking.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Mexican workers are in government-controlled unions and
don't have the same union regulations in place to protect them as
U.S. workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mexican drivers are making $7 a day hauling $70,000 or
$80,000 worth of goods on our highways,'' he said. ``These Mexican
trucking companies are taking advantage of their workers at the
same time.''

 &HT;    POLICE VS. PRIVACY: A TUG OF WAR OVER INTERNET CRIME CURBS
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories for
release Sunday, March 19.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the annals of cybercrime, the FBI's all-time
poster boy is a Russian-born math whiz named Vladimir Levin.
</P>
<P>
   Working from his kitchen table in St. Petersburg on a vintage
laptop computer, Levin (once known online as Vova) managed to
transfer more than $10 million from Citibank accounts in six other
countries. He now resides in a federal prison in Florida, serving a
three-year term.
</P>
<P>
   Levin committed his spectacular online heist in 1994, when the
Internet was still in its infancy. It still stands as the largest
recorded electronic crime in history, but that's because nobody
knows how much goes unrecorded and unpunished.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to develop the capacity to actively investigate and
work with our colleagues around the world to bring these people to
justice, and to do whatever we can to prevent cybercrime in the
first place,'' Attorney General Janet Reno told a House
appropriations subcommittee March 8.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Reno released a 28,000-word report on the problem
titled ``The Electronic Frontier: The Challenge of Unlawful Conduct
Involving the Use of the Internet.'' (It can be found on the Web at
www.usdoj.gov/criminal/cybercrime, along with a 21,000-word
appendix.)
</P>
<P>
   Reno's report noted that in most cases, existing laws cover
online crimes. But the Internet does pose fresh challenges, it
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``These challenges,'' it said, ``include the inability to trace
criminals who hide their identities on line, difficulty in finding
criminals who might be located in other jurisdictions and the need
for trained personnel at all levels of law enforcement.''
</P>
<P>
   The report received scant attention in the press. Behind the
scenes, however, it has ignited a spirited debate.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy pits members of the law enforcement and national
security worlds against champions of privacy and civil liberties.
Both sides criticize Reno, but for different reasons.
</P>
<P>
   One side argues that the attorney general should be pressing
Congress for more resources to combat cyber-criminals, who, they
say, pose a grave threat the continued rapid growth of the
so-called New Economy. The other side views the report as a direct
threat to online privacy by weakening constitutional guarantees of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Testimony on Capitol Hill, much of it in closed session, shows
that what most vexes cops and counter-spies is what the report
describes as ``the lack of identification mechanisms on global
networks.''
</P>
<P>
   In essence, this means that architecture of the Internet allows
everyone, including would-be criminals, to remain anonymous or even
to take on masked identities by adopting false personas or by
providing inaccurate biographical information and misleading
digital names.
</P>
<P>
   Given the current state of technology, ``it can be difficult to
accurately identify an individual (especially sophisticated users
who take affirmative steps to hide their identity) on the
Internet,'' the report says.
</P>
<P>
   It calls this a ``thorny issue.'' But even the mere suggestion
that online privacy can get in the way of effective law enforcement
has civil libertarians up in arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the laws are going to be updated, they need to be updated
to guarantee more privacy rights to Americans, rather than less,''
said Barry Steinhardt, associate director of the American Civil
Liberties Union (ACLU).
</P>
<P>
   Gregory Nojeim, a legislative counsel with the group's national
office, said: ``Anonymity on the Internet is not a 'thorny issue;'
it is a constitutional right. Law enforcement and national security
agencies want to outlaw the digital equivalent of pen names.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before Reno released the massive report, the ACLU had
voiced its unhappiness in a 1,200-word open letter to the attorney
general. (The Justice Department had given several key public
interest lobbying groups, including the ACLU, an advance peek at
the contents.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The report contains virtually no statistics on the extent of
computer-related crime, or whether such activity poses a truly
significant threat to our nation,'' the ACLU letter said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead, the report merely mentions several anecdotes on how a
few
</P>
<P>
   individuals have used the computers to commit crimes. Such
statistics should be disclosed before any statutory changes are
even considered.''
</P>
<P>
   But many independent Internet security experts believe the
threat, if anything, has been understated by top government
officials, including Reno and President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Corporate image and reputation are at serious risk in the wake
of increased cyber-vandalism attacks against corporate America,''
argues Dan Woolley, president and chief operating officer of Global
Integrity Corp., an online data protection firm based in Reston,
Va.
</P>
<P>
   To better thwart online criminals, the report cites ``the need
for real-time tracing of Internet communications across traditional
jurisdictional boundaries, both domestically and internationally.''
</P>
<P>
   This seems to place the Justice Department behind the idea of a
national tracing authority, which civil libertarians doubt can
function within a constitutional framework.
</P>
<P>
   By and large, security experts see this as an idea whose time as
come.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's useful because you want to be able to streamline the
process, you want to be able to trace these transactions in a
matter of hours and days, and not weeks or months,'' Mark Rasch, a
former federal prosecutor who works for Global Integrity, recently
told National Public Radio.
</P>
<P>
   Added Rasch: ``What is electronic mail? What is voice over
Internet? Is it mail? Is it phone? We don't know. And so you just
present that as an issue and say, 'We need to develop a new legal
paradigm for the new technologies.'''

AS `ERIN,' JULIA ROBERTS IS PRETTY TOUGH WOMAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   STUDIO HEAD: Okay, the door is closed, the phone is turned off
and I'm ready for your pitch.
</P>
<P>
   AGENT: You're just gonna love this one! It's the true story of a
sleazy lawyer or paralegal or something who gains self-respect by
single-handedly taking on a multi-billion dollar corporation that's
been polluting the ground water with toxic chemicals and callously
poisoning the people of a small town and ...
</P>
<P>
   SH: Hold it right there! I saw this movie last year. It was that
Travolta thing in New England ... ``A Civil something or other.''
</P>
<P>
   A: But this one takes place in California.
</P>
<P>
   SH: I don't care where it takes place. It's exactly the same
story.
</P>
<P>
   A: But ``A Civil Action'' grossed over a hundred mil.
</P>
<P>
   SH: Hmmmmm.
</P>
<P>
   A: And get this ... Julia Roberts is interested in playing the
...
</P>
<P>
   SH: The lawyer is a woman?
</P>
<P>
   A: Not exactly a lawyer. She's a kind of office worker in a
small legal firm _ no education at all _ who takes on this
impossible fight when none of the real lawyers can be bothered. Her
name's Erin Brockovich.
</P>
<P>
   SH: No education, huh? That's good _ people hate lawyers.
Unless, of course, they're John Travolta.
</P>
<P>
   A: She says exactly that in the movie _ ``I hate lawyers.'' The
lawyers all look like idiots.
</P>
<P>
   SH: A woman of the people.
</P>
<P>
   A: Exactly. And a trashy-sexy woman of the people. She dresses
the way Julia did in ``Pretty Woman.'' We'll have her model the
entire Frederick's of Hollywood catalog before the movie's done.
</P>
<P>
   SH: Hmmmm. Interesting. Still, I dunno. A sexy Julia is good but
not necessarily great box-office. Not the kind that'll guarantee a
return on Julia's $20 million up-front salary.
</P>
<P>
   A: But wait! Not only is she sexy, she's an earth mother. She's
got three kids _ including a baby _ that she drags through the
movie like she's Norma Rae.
</P>
<P>
   SH (moving to the edge of his seat): Trashy but a devoted
mother. Now I'm interested. Tell me about the rest of the package.
</P>
<P>
   A: And we got Albert Finney as her crusty boss. He's
conservative, she's gutter-mouthed. Think of the potential for
conflict. And I ask you: Is there anything cuter than Julia being
gutter-mouthed?
</P>
<P>
   SH: Albert ... who?
</P>
<P>
   A: British actor. Almost won the Oscar in 1963 for ``Tom
Jones.''
</P>
<P>
   SH: I wasn't even born in 1963.
</P>
<P>
   A: Forget Albert Finney. He'll bring in the boomers. We got
Aaron Eckhart as Erin's biker next-door neighbor and sometime lover
_ the handsome guy from ``In the Company of Men.'' And get this.
The biker takes care of her kids while Erin's on her crusade _ a
biker Mr. Mom. I mean, eat your heart out, Chris Columbus.
</P>
<P>
   SH: I'm liking this idea more and more. Still, that name. Erin
Brockowhatever. It's a mouthful. Can't we change it?
</P>
<P>
   A: Nah, I'm afraid we're stuck with it. It's the woman's real
name _ and we're claiming this is a true story.
</P>
<P>
   SH: So what? Look at ``The Hurricane.'' None of that stuff
really happened and they still called it a true story.
</P>
<P>
   A: But they kept the guy's name. We can change everything else,
but we have to keep the name. That's the unwritten rule of true
stories. Anyway, Julia likes the name.
</P>
<P>
   SH: I see your point.
</P>
<P>
   A: Julia even wants to use it as the title. Can't you see it?
Julia Roberts is ``Erin Brockovich.'' Gives you goose bumps,
doesn't it? Oozes integrity.
</P>
<P>
   SH: Who's the director?
</P>
<P>
   A: Steven Soderbergh is interested.
</P>
<P>
   SH (suddenly cautious): Soderbergh! ``The Limey'' ... ``Out of
Sight'' ... I dunno. Great reviews, terrible box-office.
</P>
<P>
   A: But Soderbergh's got edge. And Julia wants edge. She's tired
of being regarded as a cream puff.
</P>
<P>
   SH: Edge is good, but it only plays to college kids and critics,
not real people. I wouldn't want another ``Mary Reilly'' on my
hands.
</P>
<P>
   A: Forget ``Mary Reilly.'' Think of ``Notting Hill'' and
``Runaway Bride.'' The woman who wrote the script also co-wrote
``Pocahontas'' and ``Ever After,'' for crying out loud, so how edgy
can it be?
</P>
<P>
   SH (still cautious): Yeah, but ... people being poisoned. We're
talking kids with cancer here, right? I dunno. Is it uplifting?
Does it have a depressing ending?
</P>
<P>
   A: Not at all! This woman helps 600 and some-odd small-town
people go the distance. It's ``Rocky'' times 600. It's ``Mary
Poppins'' not ``Mary Reilly.''
</P>
<P>
   SH (still hesitant but weakening): But does Julia smile a lot?
Audiences just hate it when Julia frowns. Think of ``Dying Young.''
Think of ``Michael Collins.''
</P>
<P>
   A: I have to be honest with you. She does frown once or twice.
Okay, three times. But otherwise, she smiles all through the movie
_ that radiant billion-dollar smile just beams down on us like a
light from heaven.
</P>
<P>
   SH: Hmmmmm. Let me see if I have this straight. Julia's
gutter-mouthed cute-as-a-bug and she's a great mother and she
dresses like a hooker and she makes the lawyers look like fools and
she lights up the world with her smile.
</P>
<P>
   A: That's about it.
</P>
<P>
   SH: Then I think we got ourselves a movie.
</P>

 &HT;    Theater, CDs, huge TV ratings bolster crooner's career
 &HT;    By Charles Passy
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   There was a time when the very mention of Barry Manilow's name
would prompt bursts of laughter from musical snobs. Think
Copacabana, Mandy, I Write the Songs and all his other hit records:
A cool set list, it wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   But while Manilow's name is still synonymous with the schlock
pop of the '70s, the singer-songwriter has moved beyond those days.
His 30th album, Manilow Sings Sinatra, released in 1998, earned him
critical kudos and two Grammy nominations. A two-hour special for
A&AMP;E, Manilow: Live By Request, was the most-watched show in the
cable network's history. And he's got two Broadway shows in the
works.
</P>
<P>
   Could it be that Barry Manilow is finally ready to be taken
seriously?
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the 53-year-old Manilow says that the career he has
today is what he always intended for himself: That pop-star phase
was just an aberration. ``It's a fulfillment of musical dreams of
mine,'' he explains by phone of his current artistic success,
speaking in advance of his performance at the MARS Music
Amphitheatre on Friday night. ``My roots really have not been in
pop music. I found myself making pop albums and it was a big
surprise to me that they were successful. My roots were always in
Broadway, jazz, cabaret and that kind of thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, before Manilow, a New York native, found his way to the
top of the charts, he was working as a jingle writer and producer
for a still unknown Bette Midler. ``It was much more challenging
music for a musician than what was on the pop radio of the '60s,
except for The Beatles and Stones.... The bubble-gum stuff never
interested me at all,'' he explains. But by the '70s, Manilow was
singled out by record producers as a potential pop poster-child. On
the surface, he seemed an unlikely star _ he didn't have the
golden-boy looks or the reckless rocker's attitude. Instead, he
gave the impression of a musical geek who spent too much of his
time fiddling at the keyboard. Which, in fact, he was.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Manilow's musical explorations meant he knew how to write a
tune, always a valuable commodity. Even his first big hit, Mandy, a
song he didn't compose, benefited from his clever craftsmanship: In
its original version, it was an uptempo rocker; Manilow found the
tender ballad buried within. ``I seemed to have invented the power
ballad,'' he says with nostalgic fondness.
</P>
<P>
   But not all the memories of those days are kind. Manilow took
many a swipe from the critical community _ and while he admits some
of the remarks were perhaps deserved since he ``was learning on the
job,'' others were not. ``I would get up in the morning and I would
wince,'' he recalls of his reaction to the negative press. ``I
would go into self-pity, then I would get angry, then I would get
really furious and then I would go on stage.'' His fans, in other
words, became his salvation _ along with the honors he earned,
including Grammy, Emmy and Tony awards.
</P>
<P>
   More to the point, Manilow says, ``the way you get through is by
just believing in what you do.'' He points to the example of the
much-maligned Copacabana, a song he considers among his best.
``It's a beautifully crafted song ... with a catchy melody you
can't get out of your head,'' he asserts.
</P>
<P>
   In that vein, Manilow is revisiting the song in the form of a
Broadway show, simply titled Barry Manilow's Copacabana: The
Musical, a collaboration with original lyricist Barry Sussman. It
already has played to sold-out houses during an 18-month London
run. Now, he is planning on touring it in this country starting in
June.
</P>
<P>
   And that's not Manilow's only Broadway project. Working with
Sussman again, he's also developed a more serious show, Harmony,
about the Comedian Harmonists, a famous German singing group
disbanded by the Nazis because some of its members were Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   While other pop artists have ventured into theatrical waters
with disastrous results _ remember Paul Simon's The Capeman? _
Manilow is confident about his chances. ``Paul came into it
thinking he could do it because he's such a brilliant songwriter,
but there's a craft to writing Broadway musicals that you must
have,'' Manilow says.
</P>
<P>
   For the time being, however, Manilow is putting his Broadway
aspirations aside so he can concentrate on his career as a concert
artist (and, yes, he still sings his old hits).

   AMERICAN BEAUTY
</P>
<P>
   (R) A
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Spacey is nominated for an Oscar for his mesmerizing
performance in this brilliant dark comedy. The witty, insightful
film is a biting exploration of how adhering to societal
conventions can lead to false and unfulfilling lives. However, its
ironic humor may be too dark for mainstream tastes. While we know
where it's heading from the outset, American Beauty delivers enough
off-the-wall plot twists to get there in unexpectedly tense
fashion. (10/1) Strong sexuality, profanity, violence, drug
content; 17 and older.
</P>
<P>
   ANY GIVEN SUNDAY
</P>
<P>
   (R) B-
</P>
<P>
   Oliver Stone captures the raw excitement of professional
football, casting the players and coaches as modern-day gladiators
whose chivalric age is coming to an end. Unfortunately, the drama
runs more than 2 1/2 hours, and Stone's hyperkinetic mix of images
and film speeds seems overly stylized. The film hits its notes hard
and often, but it gets more involving as it goes, building to one
of the most thrilling climaxes in sports-movie history. (12/22)
Strong profanity, some nudity/sexuality; 17 and older.
</P>
<P>
   THE BEACH
</P>
<P>
   (R) C
</P>
<P>
   Leonardo DiCaprio plays a morally flawed U.S. traveler searching
for a fabled island paradise in this dark and bloody tale, based on
Alex Garland's novel. Though ambitious, Danny Boyle's stylish but
downbeat film is way overdone _ particularly when DiCaprio's
unsympathetic character descends into loopy, Apocalypse Now
-inspired fantasy. Heavy narration and an overly self-conscious
stylistic approach keep viewers at arm's length. (2/11) Violence,
strong sexuality, profanity, drug content; 17 and older.
</P>
<P>
   BOILER ROOM
</P>
<P>
   (R) C+
</P>
<P>
   In Ben Younger's timely, bracing drama _ set amid the current
stock-market explosion _ disenfranchised young men working for a
backroom brokerage firm sell their souls to become instant
millionaires. The taut, testosterone-intensive film starts off
strongly, absorbing you with the hyper-aggressive action, but it
plummets like overhyped stock in the second half, simmering to a
tepid remake of Oliver Stone's Wall Street. (2/18) Strong
profanity, some drug content; 16 and older.
</P>
<P>
   THE CIDER HOUSE RULES
</P>
<P>
   (PG-13) B-
</P>
<P>
   John Irving wrote the screenplay for the most successful
adaptation of one of his works since The World According to Garp.
But the sweet, touching drama is only a surface reading of the epic
coming-of-age tale about an orphan who is searching to find his
place and purpose in the world. The condensed version retains the
central story but lacks a strong narrative structure. The plot
doesn't take hold until the second half of the film. (12/24) Adult
content, sexuality, nudity, substance abuse, some violence; 13 and
older.
</P>
<P>
   DROWNING MONA
</P>
<P>
   (PG-13) B
</P>
<P>
   Who killed Mona Dearly (Bette Midler), the most reviled resident
of Verplanck, N.Y.? As the outrageous caper unfolds, with its
motley crew offering boatloads of alibis and one-liners, you can't
help but laugh at the amusingly pathetic events. William Fichtner,
Marcus Thomas and Jamie Lee Curtis manage to keep straight faces
and elevate the laugh quotient in the bargain. (3/3) Profanity,
sexuality, violence; 13 and older.
</P>
<P>
   THE END OF THE AFFAIR
</P>
<P>
   (R) B+
</P>
<P>
   Neil Jordan's powerful adaptation of Graham Greene's classic
novel is an old-fashioned romantic drama about love, betrayal and
sacrifice during World War II. Emblazoned by Julianne Moore, Ralph
Fiennes and Stephen Rea's emotionally rich performances, the story
has a strong dramatic center that doesn't reveal itself until
midway through the film. Though melodramatic, the simple tale
becomes more compelling as it progresses. (1/21) Strong sexuality;
17 and older.
</P>
<P>
   THE GREEN MILE
</P>
<P>
   (R) B+
</P>
<P>
   The Green Mile is a thoughtful prison drama with a supernatural
bent. Based on Stephen King's serialized novel, the touching tale
of miracles on death row is humorous and heart-wrenching. Director
Frank Darabont trims the back stories from King's text, but his
lean adaptation still runs long at more than three hours. Tom Hanks
gives an endearing performance, and Michael Clarke Duncan is a
revelation as the tragic central character. (12/10) Violence,
profanity, some sex-related material; 16 and older.
</P>
<P>
   HANGING UP
</P>
<P>
   (PG-13) C
</P>
<P>
   This rubber-stamp dramedy about three sisters (played by Meg
Ryan, Lisa Kudrow and Diane Keaton, who also directed) teems with
equal measures of solemnity and slapstick. Practically all that
distinguishes this from a prime-time soap is the constant use of
cellular phones and grumpy Walter Matthau's zingers. (2/18)
Profanity, mature themes; 13 and older.
</P>
<P>
   THE HURRICANE
</P>
<P>
   (R) B
</P>
<P>
   Denzel Washington gives a ferocious performance as Rubin
``Hurricane'' Carter, a boxing title contender who in 1966 was
wrongly convicted of triple homicide. Director Norman Jewison
presents a stirring account of Carter's 20-year fight for justice,
focusing on his friendship with a youth who mounted a campaign for
his release. However, the film takes many liberties with Carter's
story. The script's obviousness strikes a much bigger blow. (1/14)
Profanity, some violence; 16 and older.
</P>
<P>
   MISSION TO MARS
</P>
<P>
   (PG) D
</P>
<P>
   Brian De Palma's befuddling sci-fi drama involving the first
manned mission to Mars boasts some cool special effects and several
action-packed set pieces, but the clunky thriller lacks clear
vision, thereby making virtually no sense. De Palma wastes too much
time on the characters without really developing any of them.
Nothing ties together and the dramatic moments don't pay off.
(3/10) Sci-fi violence, profanity; 10 and older.
</P>
<P>
   MY DOG SKIP
</P>
<P>
   (PG) C+
</P>
<P>
   Willie Morris' best-selling memoir about his childhood canine
gets a sugary coating from director Jay Russell, whose well-meaning
adaptation slathers on warm photography and a patriotic score. A
nostalgic, innocuous slice of 1940s Mississippi, made digestible by
young star Frankie Muniz and kernels of conflict. (3/3) Mild
profanity, fleeting violence; 8 and older.
</P>
<P>
   THE NEXT BEST THING
</P>
<P>
   (PG-13) D
</P>
<P>
   This dreary romantic drama with strained comedic overtones,
about a woman and her gay male best friend who attempt to raise a
child together, is a gender-bending twist on Kramer vs. Kramer. The
downbeat story lacks a linear flow and lurches into overwrought
melodrama. Its only laughs come when Rupert Everett resorts to
mincing stereotypes. Madonna, in her first film role since 1996's
Evita, fails to exude any warmth. (3/3) Adult content, sexual
content, partial nudity, profanity; 13 and older.
</P>
<P>
   THE NINTH GATE
</P>
<P>
   Roman Polanksi returns to form _ at least until an
out-of-control finale _ with this symbolic horror-mystery starring
Johnny Depp as a book detective and Frank Langella as the collector
who hires him. The task at hand, pinpointing the original version
of an ancient book purportedly penned by Lucifer, leads to as much
fiery nonsense as it does intrigue. (3/11) Adult language,
sexuality, nudity, violence; 18 and older.
</P>
<P>
   PITCH BLACK
</P>
<P>
   (R) B-
</P>
<P>
   Pitch Black is nothing sci-fi fans haven't seen before in such
films as Alien and Starship Troopers. Yet the derivative thriller
is well done, given its limited budget and lack of big stars. Shot
in Australia with a largely Aussie cast, the scrappy sci-fi horror
film recalls George Miller's similarly earthy classic, The Road
Warrior. Vin Diesel's menacing, charismatic turn as the hardened
antihero marks him as a potentially major talent. (2/18) Sci-fi
violence and gore, profanity; 16 and older.
</P>
<P>
   PRINCESS MONONOKE
</P>
<P>
   (PG-13) B+
</P>
<P>
   Hiyao Miyazaki's beautifully animated epic is a sophisticated
environmental fable about the struggle between man and nature,
adapted to the English language by Neil Gaiman and featuring the
voices of Claire Danes, Billy Crudup and Minnie Driver. Some of the
folkloric elements of the top-grossing Japanese film are lost on
American viewers, but the appeal of Miyazaki's characters and the
sheer beauty of his images are universal. (11/19) Images of
violence and gore; 13 and older.
</P>
<P>
   REINDEER GAMES
</P>
<P>
   (R) C-
</P>
<P>
   Originally slated for release on Christmas, when its holiday
setting would have made a lot more sense, this preposterous
thriller stars Ben Affleck as a clueless ex-convict forced to
mastermind a casino robbery. The ridiculous story is as hard to
swallow as 2-month-old eggnog. It's all just buildup for the
explosive and extremely bloody heist sequence, in which the robbers
shoot it out wearing Santa Claus costumes. (2/25) Strong violence,
profanity, sexuality; 17 and older.
</P>
<P>
   SCREAM 3
</P>
<P>
   (R) C
</P>
<P>
   The third and final chapter of the teen-horror trilogy is as
redundant as those tired old slasher movies whose conventions the
first film so cleverly skewered. Minus creator Kevin Williamson,
Scream 3 is forced and overly self-referential, relying on too many
in jokes. There are a few good laughs, mostly drawn from pop
culture references, but it's not scary. We know every beat of the
formulaic story from having seen the previous films. (2/4) Strong
horror violence, profanity; 16 and older.
</P>
<P>
   SLEEPY HOLLOW
</P>
<P>
   (R) B
</P>
<P>
   Not so much sleepy as bloody, Tim Burton's reworking of the
Washington Irving folktale boasts enigmatic Johnny Depp as Ichabod
Crane (here a constable), on the bloody trail of a headless
horseman (Christopher Walken) with a penchant for severing noggins.
The director's remarkable calling cards _ atmospheric sets,
haunting imagery, a compelling story _ are well in place; the
nonstop gore seems out of place. (11/19) Profanity, violence and
gore, sexuality; 17 and older.
</P>
<P>
   SNOW DAY
</P>
<P>
   (PG) D-
</P>
<P>
   This feeble, absent-minded comedy, aimed at children's wildest
fantasies, focuses on two stories: a lovelorn teen's infatuation
with a popular classmate and the local school kids' unsupervised
battles with a psychotic snowplow operator (Chris Elliott).
Uniformly mean-spirited and unrealistic, the film's grandest
achievement may be its ability to evoke sympathy for Chevy Chase,
as a meteorologist. (2/11) Fleeting violence; 10 and older. _
</P>
<P>
   STUART LITTLE
</P>
<P>
   (PG) C-
</P>
<P>
   E.B. White's beloved tale about a mouse (voiced by Michael J.
Fox) adopted as a normal child, reaches the silver screen and falls
in line with the recent slew of animal-talking flicks. It's a genre
whose time has passed, and director Rob Minkoff _ despite clever
bits involving alley cats _ can't bring it back without a diet of
rehashed morals. (12/17) Profanity, mild violence; 10 and older.
</P>
<P>
   SUPERSTAR
</P>
<P>
   (PG-13) F
</P>
<P>
   This dreadfully incoherent comedy spotlights Molly Shannon's
Saturday Night Live alter-ego Mary Katherine Gallagher, whose
pining for a genuine kiss knows no boundaries _ or laughs, for that
matter. The usually dependable Will Ferrell and insufferable Elaine
Hendrix compound the disaster, and its 80-odd minutes seem to last
an eternity. (10/8) Adult language; 13 and older.
</P>
<P>
   3 STRIKES
</P>
<P>
   (R) D
</P>
<P>
   Rap producer D.J. Pooh's directorial debut samples the majority
of its ideas from other movies _ most notably Friday , which Pooh
co-wrote with Ice Cube. Pooh trots out the same tired cliches and
stereotypical characters that have been seen in a host of lowbrow
urban comedies. It attempts to draw laughs from crude sex gags and
juvenile flatulence jokes, delivered amid a constant stream of
strong profanity, but it fails to score single chuckle. (3/2)
Pervasive profanity, strong sexual content, drug use, brief
violence; 17 and older.
</P>
<P>
   THE TIGGER MOVIE
</P>
<P>
   (G) B+
</P>
<P>
   The first Winnie the Pooh theatrical release in 17 years is a
funny, heartwarming musical comedy about the importance of friends
and family. Rendered in the classic style of Disney's 1960s Pooh
featurettes, with hand-drawn cels and beautiful watercolor
backgrounds, the charming adventure is pure old-fashioned
entertainment. The songs aren't that memorable, but the gentle
humor will draw laughter from young and old alike. (2/11) Nothing
objectionable; all ages.
</P>
<P>
   TOY STORY 2
</P>
<P>
   (G) A
</P>
<P>
   The wildly imaginative sequel to the 1995 computer-animated
blockbuster improves on the original with more realistic animation
and a surprisingly deep and poignant storyline. The delightful
comedy-adventure is more emotionally involving than the first film,
centering on what happens when children outgrow their toys. It's
also more consistently funny, with tons of great gags that will
have viewers of all ages roaring with laughter. (11/24) No
objectionable material; suitable for all ages.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT PLANET ARE YOU FROM?
</P>
<P>
   (R) C
</P>
<P>
   Garry Shandling's first film venture puts a disappointing spin
on the Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus battle of the sexes.
Like much of Shandling's stand-up shtick, the sci-fi comedy deals
with his alien character's inability to score with or understand
women. The premise gives him license to play a cluelessly crude and
sexist jerk, as well as to make a million penis jokes. There are
some good chuckles but no solid laughs. (3/3) Sexuality and
profanity; 16 and older.
</P>
<P>
   THE WHOLE NINE YARDS
</P>
<P>
   (R) B-
</P>
<P>
   Playing notorious contract killers, Bruce Willis and Kevin
Pollack embody their deadpan bits to perfection, but Matthew Perry,
as a frenzied dentist, overplays the physical gags. Its premise and
dialogue, expectedly wacky and improbable at turns, remain
gleefully true to the hit-man comedy genre. (2/18) Strong
profanity, sexuality, brief nudity, violence; 17 and older.
</P>
<P>
   WONDER BOYS
</P>
<P>
   (R) B-
</P>
<P>
   Curtis Hanson's first film since L.A. Confidential is a midlife
coming-of-age story that combines elements of character drama and
screwball comedy, about a dissolute novelist (Michael Douglas)
trying to write the follow-up to his masterpiece. The offbeat,
original comedy treats its eccentric characters with warm
affection, but at times the film is as unfocused as Douglas'
dope-smoking character and too whimsical for its own good.
Profanity, drug content; 16 and older.

 &HT;    Musicians wander to the Web
 &HT;    By Chris Riemenschneider
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Sure, big things are accomplished. Thousands of
CDs are sold with the click of a mouse. Huge mailing lists,
essential to a new band's fan base, are built off of e-mails. There
are even record deals offered on MP3 downloads alone.
</P>
<P>
   It's the little things, though, that demonstrate just how much
opposites can attract and Austin's music scene can take advantage
of the burgeoning high-tech world.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet saved my hide,'' said one musician, Josh
Williams.
</P>
<P>
   The bass player of a little band called the Bellfuries was
recently playing a little bar, Ego's, when a little miracle of
modern-day dot-comdom happened.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of the band's set, a phone call came from a
thousand miles away in Chattanooga, Tenn., by someone listening to
the show via a-- Austin Web site called Clubcastlive.com. The
company broadcasts MP3 audio streams from 20 different music venues
in town, allowing musicians to be heard by fans from all over the
world _ including, in Williams' case, from home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was my dad,'' Williams said. ``He told the bartender to
tell me that if I didn't wish my mom a happy birthday, I'd be in
serious trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Williams' ``Happy Birthday'' serenade from her son, his
bandmates and the patrons of Ego's indicates how music and
technology are intertwining in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   That developing relationship is especially evident this week
with the 14th annual South by Southwest Music Conference, which has
been inundated with music-related Web companies from Austin and
around the country. Local bands who used to seek record deals at
the conference are now being courted by Internet sites offering
money and exposure. Meanwhile, everyone at the festival is trying
to come to grips with the Internet's impact on the music industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Music is one of the first products that can be made, marketed
and sold completely by computers and on the Internet,'' said SXSW
managing director Roland Swenson. ``I think our conference and
Austin in general are at the forefront of all this.''
</P>
<P>
   Acceptance of the high-tech world is a giant step on the part of
the local music scene, which still blames the computer folks for
driving up rents, cramming the highways and bulldozing its favorite
live music venue, Liberty Lunch (torn down to make way for Computer
Science Corp.'s new downtown headquarters).
</P>
<P>
   But the techies' presence has proven beneficial to the music
community, too. It's getting easier for musicians to find someone
who can build them a Web site, or who know-- someone who knows
someone whose Web company is paying for music content, or who
know-- the advances in recording technology that are taking over
the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Any band that doesn't have these three developments on their
radar screen is far behind the times, say the musicians who have
made the most forays into the high-tech world.
</P>
<P>
   Musicians plug in
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet has been invaluable to me,'' said Austin
singer-songwriter Ginger Mackenzie. The Lilith Fair alumn-- sold
more than 10,000 copies of her album, ``Kismet,'' online and was
voted best artist of 1999 on San Diego-based MP3.com, one of the
biggest in the flurry of dot-com companies offering free downloads
of music by both new and established artists.
</P>
<P>
   With those kinds of achievements, it's no surprise Mackenzie is
being sought by many of the biggest record companies with
representatives at SXSW.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've told record company people the things we've been able to
accomplish, and they're all like, `What?!' Mackenzie said. ``Now I
see a lot more Austin bands on MP3 and a lot of the other Web
sites. I think the musicians in this town are becoming pretty savvy
when it comes to the Internet, so I wouldn't be surprised if there
are more acts from here that carve a path for themselves on the
Web.''
</P>
<P>
   One Austin band that has done so, Household Names, was far from
a household name in Austin when its catchy pop-rock single ``Bright
Spot'' became the No. 1 most-downloaded single on Soundclick.com.
That success then earned them a nice-sized mention in a Rolling
Stone magazine article.
</P>
<P>
   ``The great thing about it is it's so grass-roots,'' said
Household Names singer Jason Garcia, whose band has yet to play
more than a handful of local club gigs.
</P>
<P>
   Now that CDs are quite inexpensive to make and manufacture
(often around $1,000 if done on a small scale), many acts can
record a disc soon after forming and send it out to Internet
companies for promotion, as Household Names did with
Soundclick.com.
</P>
<P>
   Musicians aren't just using computer technology to promote their
music. They're also using it to make music, too, even music of high
quality and classic sound.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a breeze,'' said Austin's Zen-country legend
Jimmie Dale Gilmore about the recording of his new, critically
acclaimed album, ``One Endless Night.'' Though fueled by
traditional country and folk instruments heard on records 50 years
ago (guitars, mandolins, dobros, etc.), the disc's clear, crisp
sound quality can be credited to the fact that Gilmore and
Nashville producer Buddy Miller recorded it entirely on a Macintosh
in Miller's home studio, the singer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no tape involved whatsoever, which was one
advantage,'' Gilmore said. ``Also, it just negates the need for the
big, fancy, expensive recording studio. We did the entire album at
Buddy's house, and it was comfortable and felt a lot more organic
than all the other albums I've made.''
</P>
<P>
   Companies plug away
</P>
<P>
   Web companies are hoping a lot more can be accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   In Austin, high-tech giants such as Austin Ventures and IBM have
aligned themselves with various online music companies. Other,
smaller companies _ such as Clubcastlive.com _ have based their
content solely on music.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no better city for us to have started in,'' said
Clubcastlive marketing director Steven Phenix whose company
(started last summer) wants to create an international network
where fans such as Josh Williams' parents can hear bands performing
in a number of cities.
</P>
<P>
   As proof, Clubcastlive signed on as the official online
broadcaster of SXSW and began running ads in cities that have local
bands performing at SXSW.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is that fans in Seattle or Chicago or wherever can
hear their hometown heroes play what is often one of the biggest
gigs of their careers,'' Phoenix said. He said Clubcastlive should
be broadcasting from three other cities soon after SXSW.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not every city has 50-plus live music venues or the
plethora of music talent for Clubcastlive and other Web companies
to tap.
</P>
<P>
   This, said Audiogalaxy.com music content editor Eric Zappa, is
the main advantage his company has over its competitors in other
cities. Audiogalaxy offers music downloads and promotional
opportunities for bands, similar to Web sites such as MP3,
Listen.com and Liquid Audio.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of those companies are in the Silicon Valley and places
that don't have any kind of music scene whatsoever,'' Zappa said.
``We don't consider ourselves to be an Austin music site, but you
look on our site and you'll see Toni Price, Chris Wall, The
Damnations and many others ... There's so much great music here, it
keeps us inspired to do what we're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Mackenzie: ``Music is one of the things that makes this
city so great to live in. I hope the computers start to respect
that more.''
</P>
<P>
   Many musicians and music-loving techies believe respect is on
its way.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the best-case scenario, mentioned by some musicians, is
that the high-tech world may finally give the local music scene the
business foundation it has always lacked. Though rich in talent
since the dawn of 2/4 time, Austin has never been able to compete
with the big-three music hubs _ Los Angeles, New York and Nashville
_ because it never had the business sense or infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has always been an imbalance between the amount of
talent here and the level of the music business,'' Zappa said. ``I
think it's possible for the Austin tech companies to fill that gap,
and I think it's even happening now.''
</P>
<P>
   Web companies nationwide are threatening to replace age-old
record labels based mostly in the nation's three music hubs.
Considering the high-tech resources here, it's possible Austin may
even have a leg up on Los Angeles, New York and Nashville. In that
case, Austin musicians might have a lot more to sing about than one
mother's birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Said Phenix: ``We have something cool to show the world, our
music scene. What better way to show it off nowadays than on the
Internet?''

`MIRACLE' AIDS DRUGS FAIL TO LIVE UP TO HOPE OR HYPE

 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Four years ago, a new class of anti-AIDS drugs brought
hope that the deadly disease could become a chronic, manageable
condition such as diabetes. A few even spoke of a cure.
</P>
<P>
   Today, a grim realization is dawning that for many people, the
``miracle'' drugs are only buying time.
</P>
<P>
   Precious little time.

   ``We all have patients who we saw rise from the dead thanks to
some of these drugs,'' said Dr. Thomas Hooton, medical director of
the University of Washington's AIDS clinic at Harborview Medical
Center. ``We don't see that any more.''
</P>
<P>
   The drugs he's talking about are known as protease inhibitors _
anti-HIV medications with such mystical-sounding names as
nelfinavir, indinavir or saquinavir. In 1995, after the protease
inhibitors first became available, many extremely ill people made
astounding recoveries.
</P>
<P>
   AIDS mortality rates plummeted. At a 1996 international AIDS
conference, a few researchers even went so far as to suggest
science had found a ``cure'' for AIDS _ a drug therapy that could
suppress HIV to undetectable levels and perhaps prevent disease.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, with 14 different anti-HIV drugs on the
market, the optimism has faded. Some are predicting AIDS death
rates will increase again. And confusion reigns as experts debate
which therapeutic approach works best.
</P>
<P>
   There's no question that the drugs, used together with other
anti-HIV medications in a ``drug cocktail'' often known as HAART
(highly active anti-retroviral therapy), saved lives and improved
quality of life, particularly in the United States and other
developed countries where the $10,000 annual cost is affordable.
</P>
<P>
   But many are not doing so well any more, Hooton said, and new
studies now indicate that only half of those on HAART appear to
fully benefit from it.
</P>
<P>
   ``For whatever reason, the virus outwits the drugs,'' Hooton
said. HIV is constantly undergoing genetic mutations, he said, a
random process that occasionally allows it to stumble onto a new
way around medicine's latest therapeutic assault against it.
</P>
<P>
   The complicated new anti-HIV drug regimens have been difficult
for people to adhere to, Hooton said, and inadequate adherence can
create drug-resistant HIV. If the virus is allowed to replicate in
the presence of inadequate medication, drug resistant forms of the
virus can emerge.
</P>
<P>
   Also, newly recognized complications associated with the HIV
therapies _ such as an increased risk of heart disease,
osteoporosis and diabetes _ have further diminished initial
enthusiasm for these new drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Some doctors continue to be strong advocates of aggressive drug
therapy, believing that when the medications fail, new combinations
of drugs will take their place. Others now tell their infected
patients to wait until they get sick before going on anti-HIV
therapy _ a complete about-face from the previous policy of
starting therapy immediately upon learning of the infection.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we can do is buy time,'' said Dr. Robert Killian, a
Seattle physician who treats people with HIV infection. ``I've
backed off on pushing these drugs until completely necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the strange and sometimes disfiguring problem of
body-fat maldistribution, in which people on anti-HIV drugs lose
nearly all their subcutaneous fat only to see it collect in big
lumps on the neck or stomach.
</P>
<P>
   This fat distribution problem is thought to be related to the
dramatic increase in cholesterol and blood lipids seen in some
HIV-infected people.
</P>
<P>
   While none of the experts is certain if these problems are
caused by the drugs or are simply long-term complications of HIV
infection, everyone's quite certain now that the promise of the
protease inhibitors was oversold.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hope and hype has not been realized,'' Dr. Jeff Schouten,
an HIV-positive physician active in local and federal AIDS policy
matters who works with the Seattle Treatment Education Project, a
nationally recognized organization that provides AIDS/HIV
information.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gave people a false sense of complacency,'' Schouten said.
``There's a perception out there that doesn't match the reality.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a dangerous misperception.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people are becoming unsafe again in their sexual behavior
because they think the infection can be controlled by these
drugs,'' Schouten said. The word needs to get out there, he said,
that people are still dying from this disease and the drugs so far
have only provided a temporary respite.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prevention remains critically important,'' agreed Dr. Ann
Collier, chief of the UW's AIDS Clinical Trials Unit. ``Treatment
hasn't yet made this a chronic, manageable disease for most
people.''
</P>
<P>
   The history of the battle against AIDS, she said, has been like
a roller coaster with a repeated series of high-flying expectations
followed by scary plunges. We're on one of those plunges right now,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   But both Collier and Schouten said there are new experimental
therapies that may hold promise when people ``burn out'' on the
HAART therapies.
</P>
<P>
   Most anti-HIV therapies work by interfering with the virus'
ability to reproduce itself.
</P>
<P>
   HIV is different from most other viruses that infect us. It's a
slow-acting virus that attacks the immune system cells, called
T-cells, that are supposed to protect us from such invaders. And
it's a ``retrovirus,'' which means it incorporates its genetic
material into the infected T-cell's DNA to make our cells crank out
new HIV particles.
</P>
<P>
   AZT was the first anti-HIV drug _ a member of a class of drugs
known as nucleoside analogues. These drugs mimic genetic material
and are used to infiltrate HIV's genetic command center to disable
it and prevent it from incorporating its DNA into our cells.
</P>
<P>
   When AZT began to fail, doctors turned to a second class of
drugs, ``non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors,'' which
worked by halting HIV's genetic invasion by blocking an enzyme
needed to convert HIV's genes into usable DNA.
</P>
<P>
   The third class of drugs, the protease inhibitors, attack HIV at
a completely different point, after the virus has already inserted
its DNA into the infected cell. These drugs interfere with an
enzyme to block the production of new viral particles.
</P>
<P>
   The protease inhibitors were so effective that some experts
initially speculated long-term use of these drugs could eventually
clear the virus out of the body.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody believes any more that you're going to
get viral clearance,'' said Brian Coppedge, a treatment information
specialist who works with Schouten at STEP.
</P>
<P>
   New anti-HIV drugs in the clinical-trial pipeline aim to attack
HIV on some new fronts. These drugs are available only to those few
patients accepted into clinical trials.
</P>
<P>
   The experimental drugs are still ``inhibitors,'' but they
inhibit the virus in different ways.
</P>
<P>
   Entry inhibitors work to prevent the virus from entering the
human cell in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Another category of experimental anti-HIV drugs are called
integration inhibitors. These drugs aim to stop the integration of
the viral genes into the T-cell's DNA.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're so much further along than we were five years ago,''
said Hooton, referring to drugs now on the market. ``We do have
something to offer HIV patients therapeutically.''
</P>
<P>
   But there's no magic bullet yet, Hooton said, and about 40,000
people still become infected in the United States every year. The
problem of HIV and AIDS worldwide, especially in the developing
world, is even more urgent and terrifying, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Schouten said he's become more hopeful about the new drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``But none of this has yet made having HIV like having a chronic
disease,'' he said. ``People are still dying.''

FRONT-LINE AIDS EXPERT FACES UNCERTAIN FUTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TOM PAULSON  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Dr. Robert Wood has been King County's public health
point man on AIDS since the beginning of the epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   He's also an HIV-infected man facing an increasingly uncertain
future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm scared, yes,'' said Wood, director of the HIV/AIDS control
program for Public Health _ Seattle &AMP; King County.
</P>
<P>
   Like others with the infection, he has benefited from new drugs
that many believed would allow people with HIV to completely
suppress the virus and indefinitely prevent the onset of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Few experts believe that any more.
</P>
<P>
   Wood is watching his viral load _ an estimate of the amount of
the deadly virus in his blood _ increase again.
</P>
<P>
   Because he began taking the drugs early in his battle against
the disease, he fears that what's happening to him may soon be
commonplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``These aren't good signs,'' he said, reverting to his
matter-of-fact doctor's voice, as if rendering a diagnosis on some
random case report. ``The death rates are going to go up.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the public Dr. Wood, 57, a health professional who makes
his case in the analytical and objective manner expected of him.
</P>
<P>
   But in private these days, Wood weeps about friends who have
died and sometimes also for himself and his partner, Dave Cervenka,
47. Both learned they were infected in the mid-1980s. They've fared
pretty well over the years, thanks to the arsenal of anti-HIV
medications that allowed them to keep the virus at bay.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, a new generation of drugs called protease
inhibitors brought many AIDS patients back from near death.
Mortality rates plunged, and many resumed lives and careers they
thought were lost.
</P>
<P>
   But now the threat has returned, and Wood is in the unique
position of dealing with it on two fronts, public and private.
</P>
<P>
   He's been on the front lines of the battle against AIDS since he
diagnosed the county's second official AIDS patient in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   He's been there through the community warfare over condom
distribution in schools, and in 1989, he worked with activists to
start one of the nation's first hypodermic-needle exchanges aimed
at curbing AIDS among injection drug users.
</P>
<P>
   As a public health physician who made no secret that he was gay,
Wood was in a key position to take on the potentially explosive
combination of homophobia and fear of this new and unknown disease.
He was soft-spoken, but forthright and professional. He gained the
trust of the community at large, and of the gay community in
particular.
</P>
<P>
   But he also has been willing to take on AIDS activists when he
believes a public health goal should transcend politics. Wood
enraged people in the early 1990s _ and still does today _ by his
support for confidential reporting of the names of HIV-infected
patients to track the epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   At the heat of the battle, several public health department
buildings were spray-painted with graffiti lambasting Wood for his
stance.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came under a lot of attack for that,'' said Dennis
Braddock, chairman of the state Board of Health. The state adopted
a compromise policy, reporting names at the local level and
tracking by a coded number at the state level.
</P>
<P>
   Wood's unswerving devotion to science and public health has made
him a lightning rod in AIDS politics, Braddock said. But it also
allowed him to serve as an effective liaison between disparate
groups _ activists and government, gays and the medical
establishment _ in the highly charged world of AIDS policy.
</P>
<P>
   Wood's reputation extends beyond the Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew of him before I even got here,'' said Dr. Alonzo
Plough, director of the health department since coming from Boston
in 1995. ``His work on AIDS prevention is known nationally. ... As
a scientific resource, his knowledge is tremendous.''
</P>
<P>
   But sitting in the front room of his Seattle home, the private
Wood talks with his partner about the couple's 15 years of struggle
against HIV.
</P>
<P>
   Both were among those who ``burned out'' on AZT, the first
anti-HIV drug. In 1987, they were enrolled in one of the first
studies of AZT. When the drug became ineffective, they turned to
other drug combinations, with mixed results.
</P>
<P>
   The news about the powerful therapeutic effect of the protease
inhibitors came just in time for Cervenka. He had been diagnosed
with AIDS in 1994, and went on disability a year later, quitting
his job in medical and research supply at the University of
Washington. Wood, though infected since the early 1980s, has never
been diagnosed with AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had already prepared to die,'' Cervenka said. ``I kept
asking myself why I should take these drugs if all they're going to
do is prolong the limbo I've been in.''
</P>
<P>
   But Wood encouraged his partner to try the new drugs. Cervenka's
turnaround was as remarkable as it was for many of those taking the
protease inhibitors _ drugs with mystical sounding names such as
nelfinavir, indinavir or saquinavir.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just unbelievable,'' Cervenka said. ``In a matter of
weeks, my T-cell count (a blood cell count indicating immune system
health) doubled.''
</P>
<P>
   Cervenka is still doing well on the new drugs. But Wood's HIV
count has been increasing, indicating the effectiveness of his
current drug regimen is diminishing. And, as is true for many
others with the infection, there's no other new option out there
for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you become resistant to one protease inhibitor, you're
probably resistant to all of them,'' Wood said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When someone burns out the protease inhibitors ...,'' Wood's
voice trailed off as he glanced at Cervenka. ``I'm just a realist,
I guess.''
</P>
<P>
   Cervenka looked back at Wood for a long time. Then he turned and
said, ``I still feel optimistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Cervenka already gave up once. He's not about to accept his
partner's resignation _ just as Wood refused to accept Cervenka's
desire to simply die years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been lucky so far to be riding this crest, just staying
ahead of death,'' he said. ``I do have hope, even if it's more
uncertain now.''
</P>
<P>
   When Wood started taking his new course of protease inhibitors _
having run the course on an early regimen _ he got very sick.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prior to all this, I had tolerated the drugs pretty well,''
Wood said. ``This combination made me sick.''
</P>
<P>
   That disturbing turn of events pushed his partner over the edge.
</P>
<P>
   Cervenka had come to depend on Wood's well-being for his own
sense of security. He was the one who had been diagnosed with AIDS.
He was the one taking 35 pills a day. Wood was supposed to be the
strong factor in this equation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just went ballistic,'' Cervenka recalled. His anxiety about
Wood, compounded by an ongoing struggle with bipolar disorder,
became so pronounced he required hospitalization.
</P>
<P>
   Wood still suffers from drug complications and has lost nearly
all his body fat, apparently a side effect of the protease
inhibitors. But the two have come to terms with their situation in
different ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob's a scientist and says things objectively, while I still
tend to get all emotional,'' Cervenka said. ``But I'm getting more
objective about it and, at times, he can be very emotional.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the stresses of his job and his illness, Wood said he has
learned to rely on Cervenka's support at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times I just come home and cry on Dave's shoulder,''
Wood said.
</P>
<P>
   But Wood and Cervenka say they are somehow more at peace these
days despite the clouds on the horizon. They and their cats enjoy
quiet evenings and, when weather permits, take in a view of Lake
Washington from their deck.
</P>
<P>
   Watching the old television show ``Star Trek'' is weekly de
rigueur for the couple.
</P>
<P>
   They have different temperaments that clearly work in
complementary fashion. Wood, reared in upstate New York, has an
Eastern intellectual way about him and sometimes can't kick out of
work mode when he comes home.
</P>
<P>
   Cervenka, who grew up in nearby Sumner, Wash., is more of a
homebody and likes to spend his time in the garden. Circumstances
have forced both to live for today, something he would advise
everyone to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've learned to live in the here and now and not think too
much about the future,'' Cervenka said.

SEATTLE TO BE CENTER FOR HIGH-STAKES FEDERAL AIDS EFFORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CAROL SMITH  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Scientists appear closer to checkmating the AIDS virus
with a vaccine, and Seattle is at the center of the effort.
</P>
<P>
   Within the next several weeks, Seattle will be named global
headquarters for all the AIDS vaccine work being done under the
National Institutes of Health. The HIV Vaccine Trials Network will
be run by Dr. Larry Corey, head of the infectious disease program
at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center.
</P>
<P>
   As new anti-AIDS drugs lose their power against the quickly
mutating virus, an effective vaccine could be the last, best hope
to contain the epidemic. An estimated 40 million people worldwide
are infected with HIV, with an additional 16,000 people, most in
developing countries, infected per day.
</P>
<P>
   The Seattle effort will coordinate a massive, expedited effort
to get new vaccines into widespread clinical trials as quickly as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   The search for an AIDS vaccine has turned into a high-stakes
chess match with scientists trying to trick the virus at its own
game _ manipulating the body's immune system. As researchers devise
ever more clever and sophisticated molecular strategies to combat
it, the virus has continued to outwit efforts to erase it.
</P>
<P>
   But after years of frustrating effort, the science of
vaccination _ still rooted in 18th-century principles _ appears
ready to move forward by biological quantum leaps.
</P>
<P>
   Those leaps will come in the form of new genetic technologies,
which are now emerging in laboratories around the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure most of these technologies will be in place within
five years,'' said Phil Greenberg, a professor of medicine and
immunology at the University of Washington and a virologist at the
Hutchinson Center. ``Certainly, we will be testing in clinical
models (patient trials) within the next five years.''
</P>
<P>
   Corey and his colleagues hope the federal effort will mark a new
era in vaccine development.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to put under one umbrella a group of scientists to
try to speed development of a vaccine and coordinate (the
development) in a way that's not been done before,'' said Corey,
who has a joint appointment at the University of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen years ago, scientists assumed that the secret to an AIDS
vaccine was simply finding the right piece of the virus to use as
the ``antigen'' to elicit an immune response. This is old-school,
mainline vaccine warfare. Antigens are proteins, usually foreign to
the body, that cause the immune system to generate antibodies. In
an immune response, the antibodies lock onto the antigenic protein,
``neutralizing'' it and allowing the body to rid itself of foreign
invaders.
</P>
<P>
   This is the body's front-line defense against disease, the
mechanism by which we combat most viral and bacterial pathogens.
Traditional vaccines that harness this mechanism have brought many
devastating diseases under control, from polio to smallpox.
</P>
<P>
   But it hasn't worked with HIV.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past decade, there have been more than 40 AIDS vaccine
regimens tried in more than 3,000 subjects. The results have been
disappointing _ weak, short-lived immune responses that failed to
neutralize the virus.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for these failures lies in the nature of the virus
itself.
</P>
<P>
   HIV does not trigger the body's immune system, Corey said. ``The
virus is very clever. It's developed ways of masking itself from
the immune response. It's been a formidable obstacle.''
</P>
<P>
   The biology of HIV is different from other viruses, particularly
those that cause acute infections, Greenberg said. ``Its special
characteristics make it a lot more difficult than many of the
viruses we have vaccines for.''
</P>
<P>
   HIV causes a chronic, persistent infection that has a latent
phase. The virus lurks in the immune system, hiding out undetected
by the body, while it prepares for the eventual assault on immune
system cells that leads to AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   The virus is a notorious shape shifter, mutating quickly into
different strains that make it more difficult for any one antibody
to ``neutralize'' all the different versions.
</P>
<P>
   But there is something even more difficult about trying to
control HIV through vaccines.
</P>
<P>
   ``The really critical obstacle with HIV is that vaccines in
general have been effective as means of preventing disease, not
preventing infection,'' Greenberg said. ``The problem is that
probably won't be an acceptable outcome for an HIV vaccine because
of the nature of the infection.''
</P>
<P>
   Once in the door, the virus can exploit even the tiniest
foothold in the immune system, eventually overtaking it and killing
the patient. Some AIDS researchers now believe that any vaccine
will have to prevent infection, not just prevent the development of
the disease after infection.
</P>
<P>
   But others disagree, arguing that a vaccine that slows the onset
of disease, or reduces its severity, is a legitimate goal. While
such a vaccine may not contain the epidemic, it would allow people
to live longer with HIV, and reduce human suffering with the
disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the issues being debated at the moment is whether the
vaccines we're dealing with now, especially the combination vaccine
regimens, are good enough to move into clinical trials,'' said
Corey, who is optimistic that the current generation of vaccines
may prove effective. ``The question is how do you assess what's
good enough.''
</P>
<P>
   This question has essentially divided the vaccine research
community into two camps. One believes in waging the search for a
vaccine in the laboratory, the other in the field.
</P>
<P>
   Killer cells:
</P>
<P>
   Corey's optimism is rooted in a new understanding of how to
manipulate the immune system at a molecular level to generate
larger immune responses.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers have long been intrigued by a special group of
patients _ the so-called ``non-progressors'' _ who are infected
with the virus but who don't go on to develop AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   What distinguishes this group is that they typically have high
levels of ``cytotoxic T lymphocytes'' (T-cells), which are
specialized killing cells that attack foreign invaders.
</P>
<P>
   The immune system has two arms _ one that generates antibodies,
and another that generates T-cells. Scientists now believe that the
secret to an effective HIV vaccine lies in stimulating both arms of
the immune system.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, there are at least a half-dozen vaccine strategies
under development that hope to do just that. Some of these include
using other non-pathogenic viruses as ``vectors'' to shuttle HIV
genes into the body, essentially turning the body's own cells into
antigen-producing factories. There is some evidence that such ``DNA
vaccines'' can produce a more vigorous, sustained immune response,
including the production of killer T-cells.
</P>
<P>
   ``The live vector-based approach is very, very exciting right
now,'' said Dr. Norman Letvin of Harvard Medical School and a
leading AIDS vaccine researcher.
</P>
<P>
   A new paradigm:
</P>
<P>
   Targeted Genetics Corp., a Seattle-based biotech firm, is
banking on such a vaccine. The company, which has developed
proprietary techniques for gene therapy, is looking at ways of
harnessing those techniques to transfer HIV genes to cells.
</P>
<P>
   Targeted's approach is based on ``adeno-associated virus'', a
common virus that doesn't itself cause disease. By using
recombinant DNA techniques to insert HIV genes into the AAV genome,
then ``infecting'' cells with the recombined virus, the cells begin
producing viral antigens, turning on the immune system.
</P>
<P>
   Studies have shown that the response is both strong and
long-lasting, said Pervin Anklesaria, director of research at
Targeted Genetics.
</P>
<P>
   Targeted recently signed a $6 million, three-year deal with the
International AIDS Vaccine Initiative, a non-profit funded in large
part by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, to fund development
of an AAV-based HIV vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   The Targeted Genetics deal represents a new strategy in vaccine
research in another way as well.
</P>
<P>
   Most vaccine development in past decades has been done by
commercial companies. However, the HIV problem has been so
formidable, the risk so high and the cost so great that the private
sector has all but abandoned the effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``It killed a few companies along the way,'' Corey said.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers realized several years ago that the discovery of an
AIDS vaccine was unlikely to happen without collaboration between
the public and private sectors.
</P>
<P>
   That is now starting to happen. Last year, the Gates Foundation
awarded $25 million to the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative.
In addition, part of the foundation's $750 million fund to improve
childhood vaccination in developing countries has been dedicated to
AIDS vaccine research.
</P>
<P>
   Provocative work:
</P>
<P>
   Despite the renewed resources for clinical trials, and promising
new technologies to exploit, there are still some basic scientific
questions that need to be answered.
</P>
<P>
   For example, scientists are still struggling to figure out which
HIV genes will best elicit immune responses.
</P>
<P>
   But they do have clues.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, for example, a group of scientists in Montana
discovered that when the virus first infects a cell, it undergoes a
slight change in surface configuration. This change fleetingly
exposes a new receptor on the surface of the virus. Researchers
have been able to capture this transitory configuration in a
so-called ``fusion product.''
</P>
<P>
   If they then immunize mice against this ``fusion product,'' they
get a stronger immune response. And the response appears to be
capable of neutralizing many different strains of the virus.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very provocative work,'' said Greenberg, whose lab is now
collaborating with the Montana group.
</P>
<P>
   And there are more intriguing clues as well. Researchers have
recently identified a molecule called CTLA-4 that is part of the
checks and balances of the immune system, Greenberg said. It
functions by dampening the immune response, preventing the body
from overreacting and producing too many T-cells. In a clever
twist, scientists discovered they could use this to their
advantage. By using an antibody against CTLA-4 molecules, they
could block them from working, thus enabling the body to naturally
produce more T-cells. Researchers are looking at ways of combining
such an antibody with an HIV vaccine to boost the immune response.
</P>
<P>
   And there are still other immune system molecules that could be
used in conjunction with a vaccine to increase effectiveness,
Greenberg said. Immunex Corp. in Seattle, for example, has cloned a
molecule known to stimulate dendritic cell growth. Dendritic cells
are the specialized cells in the immune system that ``present''
antigens to T-cells, essentially programming them to attack that
type of antigen.
</P>
<P>
   That type of creative tinkering in the immune system is what is
most likely to pay off in an effective vaccine, Greenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The technologies are limitless,'' he said. ``And fortunately,
our imaginations are also limitless so there will be much better
ways to vaccinate in the future.''

OFFBEAT `GHOST DOG' TURNS DARK WITH GRATUITOUS BLOODSHED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   You've got to give indie filmmaker Jim Jarmusch credit for
reinventing and mixing genres in his eccentric films.
</P>
<P>
   His vision is so embraced by cult film audiences in the United
States and Europe that he's become the Jerry Lewis of independent
cinema to the French.
</P>
<P>
   He blended the grittiness of John Cassavetes' cinema verite
movies with screwball comedy for ``Down By Law'' (which starred
Oscar-winner Roberto Benigni), ``Night On Earth'' and ``Stranger
Than Paradise'' and a Hong Kong theme meshed with the ghost of
Elvis in ``Mystery Train.''
</P>
<P>
   He's even traipsed into documentary territory with his last
movie, ``Year of the Horse,'' while his 1995 film, ``Dead Man,''
though it was inert and tedious, paid homage to revisionist
westerns such as ``McCabe and Mrs. Miller.''
</P>
<P>
   With ``Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai,'' he's stirred Zen
austerity with an Italian ``spaghetti western'' sensibility. As
directed by Sergio Leone, '60s films such as ``The Good, the Bad
and the Ugly,'' ``A Fistful of Dollars'' and ``For A Few Dollars
More'' featured a ``man with no name,'' a loner antihero played by
Clint Eastwood as an extension of such stolid and stoic western
matinee idols as John Wayne and Gary Cooper.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai,'' Forest Whitaker,
playing a mysterious ronin-like hit man named Ghost Dog, embraces
the lessons of ``Hagakure, The Book of the Samurai,'' while
communing with the gangster-mentality of the mob.
</P>
<P>
   The film is a cross-cultural walking movie reference and, for
its first half, the fusion of styles works. Ghost Dog lives atop an
old apartment building in New Jersey and he shares his still and
ordered life with a cage of pigeons. Ghost Dog daily honors his
allegience to Louie (John Tormey), a mob man who once saved his
life, by performing hits on mob marks. But one night, something
goes wrong on what should have been a routine job and Ghost Dog
finds the Vargo crime family wants to eliminate him.
</P>
<P>
   Jarmusch gets an absorbing and fascinating performance from
Whitaker who, despite his large bulk, moves as effortlessly as a
cat through the rundown cityscape, and terrific character bits from
Cliff Gorman and Howard Silva as two aging mobsters. He also
incorporates disciplines and lessons from the ``Hagakure'' into the
film and, for once, the inserts cleverly mesh with the action.
</P>
<P>
   But halfway through the film, the tone shifts to a violent new
plateau that is both shocking and unsettling when a woman cop is
shot point blank and a child witnesses a faceoff in the middle of a
city block. While it may be Jarmusch's intent to document the
changing rules beneath the strange, structured code of ethics in
the worlds of both the urban samurai and the mob, he seems instead
to introduce gratuitous bloodshed that is out of sync with the
engaging, offbeat tempo and dark, comedic moral fable that has come
before.
</P>
<P>
   Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai. Directed and written by Jim
Jarmusch. Cast: Forest Whitaker, John Tormey, Cliff Gorman, Isaach
de Bankole, Henry Silva, Victor Argo. Artisan Entertainment. 116
minutes. Rated R for violence, language.

NEW DRUGS KEEP HIM, AND HIS HOPES, ALIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CAROL SMITH  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Timm Cameron is waiting for a miracle.
</P>
<P>
   It wouldn't be his first.
</P>
<P>
   Cameron, 38, has AIDS. He's been on every possible combination
of currently available drugs, but they aren't working for him any
more.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't the first time for that, either.
</P>
<P>
   Each time his medication options have run out, a new drug has
come along just in time to push back his disease one more time.
</P>
<P>
   Cameron found out he was HIV-positive just before his 30th
birthday in 1992. At the time, he was a junior at Seattle
University and had gone in for some surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was an accident (in surgery) with a scalpel,'' he said.
``They asked to test my blood.''
</P>
<P>
   He was positive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's indescribable to get the news,'' he said. ``In that
instant, everything changes.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, ``that meant death.''
</P>
<P>
   AZT had been approved, but it was the only drug available.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one was taking AZT alone and getting better,'' he said.
``The prognosis was you watched your T-cells, watched them fall,
and then you died.''
</P>
<P>
   His T-cells, an immune system cell that fights invading viruses,
continued to fall. At the time of his diagnosis, they were at 600.
(Normal is about 1,000.) A month later, they had slipped to 400. He
started AZT.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wake up every day wondering what's next,'' he said. ``You
do a mental check. If you're breathing a little different, you
think it's pneumonia. If there's a spot on your skin, you think
it's cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he managed to get his degree in psychology and work for
a year in social services, the disease was sapping all his energy.
</P>
<P>
   He ``retired'' one year after graduating from college.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1992 and 1996, a series of AZT-like drugs came out, but
none reversed his disease. His T-cell count fell to zero.
</P>
<P>
   Then in 1996, the first protease inhibitors became widely
available.
</P>
<P>
   That gave Cameron a new shot. He started dual therapy with a
combination of AZT and a protease inhibitor. His energy levels
began to improve. His T-cells rebounded to 130.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always felt blessed by this,'' he said. ``Every time I've
run out of options, something new has come out just about the time
we were done.''
</P>
<P>
   Others shared his sense of relief and euphoria.
</P>
<P>
   Within six months of the arrival of the new protease inhibitors,
the perspective of patients and care providers changed, he said.
``There was finally some kind of hope. People were getting
better.''
</P>
<P>
   By this time, Cameron was feeling well enough to volunteer as a
counselor at the Northwest AIDS Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Today, he is employed there as the client support services
coordinator. One of his jobs is helping patients adhere to their
medication regimens.
</P>
<P>
   Adherence is critical to success of the drugs, he said. Studies
have shown that 95 percent of patients who take their drugs 95
percent of the time achieve long-term viral suppression. When
patients take the drugs 70 percent of the time, only half of them
will get viral suppression.
</P>
<P>
   But the drugs don't work indefinitely, even for patients who
stick perfectly to their schedules. And the confidence that
combination therapies were going to be a permanent fix for AIDS
patients has begun to wane.
</P>
<P>
   The last combination Cameron tried, for example, worked for only
four or five months. ``Then my viral load started creeping back
up,'' he said. His T-cells now hover around 12.
</P>
<P>
   Cameron has been off medication since November. He's out of
options. His viral load continues to climb, and his fatigue is
mounting as well. He's had to cut back on his work hours.
</P>
<P>
   But he remains hopeful. There is a new protease inhibitor that
is nearing approval, and he hopes to be able to start it soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``For those of us who have been around awhile, you never know
what's around the bend,'' he said. ``I don't get as anxious as I
used to about my numbers.''

`BEAUTIFUL,' FAST AND FUNNY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This film comes at you like the assault that begins the movie:
fast, furious, comic and unexpected. The first half-hour tumbles
out in near-chaos; we don't see much beauty, but we do meet a lot
of people, and the movie expects us to be patient even though it's
in a hurry.
</P>
<P>
   Stick with it, though, because the rewards are ample. This
London-set melange of British, Welsh, Serbian and Croatian
characters starts off in conflict _ some stemming from nationalist
fervor, some from family arguments. It sometimes feels like it
needs a score card, but it gels when a young, heroin-addled
hooligan (Danny Nussbaum) finds out in the most unexpected way that
there is pain in other parts of the world. Wouldn't dream of
spoiling it for you.
</P>
<P>
   As the movie hurtles along, it encounters birth, marriage, death
and isolation. Its nearest American equivalent is ``Magnolia.''
Like that movie, it has a motley crew of characters and an
insistent soundtrack, but it plays out in much funnier ways, with
its emotions at a lower pitch (it's also barely half as long as
``Magnolia''). Writer-director Jasmin Dizdar keeps the pace
frenetic; he may let things get a little confusing in the
beginning, and his end message may not be any deeper than that we
all need to learn to get along, but he never fails to make the
journey entertaining.

ONE SMART COOKIE: JULIA ROBERTS TAKES ON WEIGHTIER ROLE, AND
DOESN'T CRUMBLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The fact-based ``Erin Brockovich'' seems like it has
``backlash'' written all over it, so it makes sense to put a
poster-child for backlash like Julia Roberts in the lead role.
Here's an actress who charmed audiences with early supporting roles
(''Mystic Pizza,'' ``Steel Magnolias'') before appearing in a huge
hit (''Pretty Woman'') that has nearly as many detractors as it has
fans. Once Roberts hit it big, her critics became harsher _ kind to
her when she starred in fluff like ``My Best Friend's Wedding,''
not so kind when she attempted more serious projects.
</P>
<P>
   Director Steven Soderbergh may have found the solution to
Roberts' drama problems with ``Brockovich,'' a movie that uses a
wicked sense of humor to examine serious themes. It's the kind of
David-vs.-Goliath story told in ``The Insider'' and ``A Civil
Action,'' but it drops the self-importance of those movies and
replaces it with a refreshingly feisty attitude.
</P>
<P>
   Soderbergh, who may be the best director that Roberts has ever
worked with (well, she worked with Steven Spielberg and Robert
Altman, but let's not bring up ``Hook'' and ``Ready to Wear''),
puts her to good use immediately. The movie's opening shot is a
loving closeup of Roberts, big hair, big eyes, big teeth filling
the screen as if it were a magazine cover. It's only when
Soderbergh pulls back that we see that she's not in control here;
as Erin Brockovich, she's at a job interview, practically begging
to be hired.
</P>
<P>
   She doesn't have much luck. A single mother with three young
children, Erin has a penchant for the type of tight-fitting,
revealing clothing that high-school guidance counselors say is a
no-no for a job-hunter. She also has an abrasive, sarcastic streak.
During her search, Erin has a nasty car wreck that puts her in a
neck brace; when she decides that her lawyer (Albert Finney) isn't
doing enough to get her a settlement, she bullies her way into a
position at his firm.
</P>
<P>
   It's there that she discovers some medical records that make her
curious enough to investigate their source, and then finds that the
illnesses are tied to contaminated water near the Death Valley
community of Hinkley, Calif. The source of the tainted water:
utility giant Pacific Gas &AMP; Electric, which apparently has been
telling residents that the water is just fine.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, what ensues is by the numbers _ Erin rallies
Hinkley's residents with a class-action suit, finds some
townspeople who are reluctant to stir things up, tangles with her
boss, encounters shady characters and argues with smug attorneys
who dismiss her because of her looks and fashion sense.
</P>
<P>
   But Soderbergh and screenwriter Susannah Grant dress up the
formula story with a lot of wit and spirit. Soderbergh is a smart
director, and he knows how to play to Roberts' strengths and
conceal her limitations. Under his guidance, she makes Erin, a
snappish character with a chip on her shoulder, appealing because
she summons up the kind of ``root for me'' pluck that goes all the
way back to the days of silent-movie actresses. Soderbergh also
uses ideas he worked out in less mainstream fare such as last
year's excellent ``The Limey'' and 1998's ``Out of Sight,'' playing
with editing and music in a way that's more immediately accessible
than it was in those less star-driven movies.
</P>
<P>
   This is Roberts' show, but Finney isn't about to be blown off
the screen by anybody, and it's amusing to watch his bluster. The
gifted Aaron Eckhart is all but wasted (and looks more than a
little ridiculous) in the role of a kindly biker who hooks up with
Erin but begins to whine about how she's never around. ``Cradle
Will Rock's'' Cherry Jones continues to impress in the role of a
woman affected by the water contamination.
</P>
<P>
   Recent fact-based movies such as ``The Hurricane'' and ``The
Insider'' were assailed for their truth-twisting, but Soderbergh
and his producers say that they've tried to stick as closely to the
facts as possible here. That doesn't mean that backlash won't
happen, especially since they acknowledge some fictionalization.
Soderbergh's biggest triumph, though, is that he delivered a film
that received enthusiastic applause from a packed preview audience.
That's evidence of a hit _ and as one of our most gifted filmmakers
who's not exactly a household name, he deserves all the success
that comes his way.

BATTLE O' THE SEXES, LOTS O' FUN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Seems like every year or so, an amusing, inconsequential
Irish-themed movie pops up _ ``The Matchmaker'' in 1997, ``Waking
Ned Devine'' in late '98/early '99. If you enjoyed those, you'll
probably enjoy ``The Closer You Get,'' which someone had the brains
to release to Middle America on St. Patrick's Day.
</P>
<P>
   This lightweight battle-of-the-sexes comedy takes place on
Ireland's Donegal coast, in a small village where everybody knows
one another, and most people are single. The men, bored with local
options, are inspired (by Bo Derek, of all people) to advertise in
the Miami Herald for American female companionship. The women
discover this, and come up with plans of their own to snag the lads
of their choice. Considering how many arrested-development cases
there are among the men, it's a wonder the women don't place an ad
of their own: ``Single Irish lasses seek lads with a bit o' sense
in 'em.''
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, the answer to the movie's key problem is right under
everyone's noses, but that doesn't mean that an hour and a half of
whimsy can't take place. Kieran (Ian Hart), the town butcher and
male ringleader, changes his appearance in hopes of snagging a
bride, not noticing the attentions of a frustrated co-worker
(Cathleen Bradley). His brother Ian (Sean McGinley) nurses a shy
crush on a local barmaid (Niamh Cusack).
</P>
<P>
   Emotions flare at a dance, men serenade women with recorded
music, people fall in love by taking quiet walks. If this sounds
familiar, it should _ it's an American teen comedy, with the
characters aged 15 years and speaking in charming brogues.

 A SURVIVOR _ LIVING WITH AIDS SINCE THE EARLY '80s  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CAROL SMITH  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BURIEN, Wash. _ Pat Migliore adjusts her reading glasses and
peers at the back of a Mayan stone carving in her hands. The
inscription reads: ``Moon goddess, the patron of sickness, is
carrying like a prisoner the symbol of fire.''
</P>
<P>
   It's one of her favorite pieces of art, picked up during her
travels in Belize a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   She savors the irony since she never expected to achieve this
particular rite of aging.
</P>
<P>
   ``Living long enough with HIV means you end up needing reading
glasses,'' she said. Her laugh is warm and quick. Petite and
rosy-cheeked with a mop of dark curly hair, she looks like she
could be a kindergarten teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Which in fact she was.
</P>
<P>
   Migliore, 47, is also one of the few survivors of her generation
of people infected with HIV. She has been HIV-infected since the
early 1980s, the advent of the epidemic, and has been diagnosed
with AIDS since the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the drugs that have begun to fail for some patients are
still working for her.
</P>
<P>
   She has outlived all the members of her original support group.
Her husband, Bob, who was diagnosed just before she was, died in
1989.
</P>
<P>
   It makes her a historian of sorts. She remembers what it was
like before there were drug cocktails to treat AIDS and people
could come back from near death to lead normal, active lives. She
remembers when there was nothing.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, Migliore began having unexplained symptoms _ strange
fevers, and unexpected fatigue. No one thought to look for HIV.
</P>
<P>
   ``I live in Burien. My husband worked at Boeing,'' she said.
``You weren't supposed to get HIV.''
</P>
<P>
   She tested positive shortly after discovering Bob was positive.
He discovered his status when he tried to donate blood.
</P>
<P>
   They were both in shock.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time, Rock Hudson had just come out about his status,''
she said. ``There were stories about Ryan White.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a certain hysteria building about the disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were afraid of it,'' she said. ``People believed things
like you could get it from doorknobs, or mosquitoes.'' There were
stories about people getting burned out of their houses for having
AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   The only person they told was their doctor.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wouldn't treat us after that,'' she said. ``He said he'd
pray for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Terrified, Migliore and her husband didn't tell anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, there were no support groups for heterosexual
patients, let alone women. Eventually, they did find a network of
friends and supporters. She founded Babes, a support group for
women with HIV. They found a doctor. She nursed Bob until the end,
when he died at home with her and their beloved dogs by his side.
</P>
<P>
   She figured it wouldn't be long before she went, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything I'd seen about AIDS led down to the person dying,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, AZT was the only drug even on the horizon, and it
was still considered experimental.
</P>
<P>
   At first, she waited to die.
</P>
<P>
   Then slowly, as she grieved her husband's death, she began
embracing her own life.
</P>
<P>
   She went on ``adventures,'' trips like those that she and Bob
had shared in their 14 years together. Her travels since his death
have taken her to Baja California, the Grand Canyon, Hawaii and New
Mexico. In 1991, she traveled to Mexico to watch and photograph the
total eclipse of the sun.
</P>
<P>
   ``An eclipse is a real metaphor for grief,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In six minutes, the moon completely blocked the sun. The sky
went dark. Thinking it was night, birds began to roost and fish to
surface.
</P>
<P>
   Life is like that when a disease like AIDS upends your
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life is very brief, and sometimes you get to catch moments of
it where things are not as they seem,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to her photographs, she collects art in her travels.
There are graceful wood ``turnings,'' too, made into urns and
vessels.
</P>
<P>
   One holds Bob's ashes. One is for hers.
</P>
<P>
   She doesn't delude herself about her future, but it doesn't
consume her.
</P>
<P>
   Now on a combination of drugs, some of them the new protease
inhibitors, she takes an average of 25 pills a day on a strict
schedule every eight hours.
</P>
<P>
   Although she left her job teaching elementary school in 1994,
the drug regimen gives her enough energy to volunteer three or four
days a week. She speaks to students in schools, trains day care
workers about AIDS, and counsels other patients about adhering to
their medication schedules.
</P>
<P>
   The schedules aren't easy to stick to. Patients can't eat for
two hours before and one hour after taking some of the drugs.
Others have to be taken with food. Most have to be taken at strict
intervals. The side effects can be brutal.
</P>
<P>
   But she can't afford to miss even one dose for fear the virus
could become resistant. She's one of the lucky ones. So far, the
drug cocktail she's been taking for three years is keeping her
viral counts under control. She knows there are a finite number of
drugs available. ``These aren't magic pills,'' she said. ``Some
people run out of options.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a perspective she tries to share with the patients she
counsels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like the grandmother talking about back in the old
days, about people who knew what it was like back then, who knew
what a fine thread we're hanging by.''

&HT;     MCCAIN, BRADLEY INTERLUDE IS ONE TO REMEMBER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 &HT;     (For release Sunday, March 19)   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 &HT;     By ROBERT E. THOMPSON  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Let history record that in the first spring of the
new millennium, a fresh breeze billowed across the American
political landscape, providing hope of reform.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as February faded into March and the first jonquils and
forsythia of the emerging season festooned the banks of the
Potomac, the two men responsible for that breeze _ John McCain and
Bill Bradley _ were eliminated from competition for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the interlude was a short one that already is
being forgotten as America focuses on the exploits and insults of
Al Gore and George W. Bush. By November, when we elect our next
president, the interlude may be as much an event of the past as
Barry Goldwater's quest for the presidency in 1964 or Eugene
McCarthy's campaign in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   But the words and deeds of McCain and Bradley should not be
forgotten. They reignited the flames of idealism in the stagnant
souls of many Americans who are weary of Clinton's sexual escapades
and wary of what Gore and Bush have to offer. For a brief time they
could dream the dreams that fired insurgents of the past to fight
for an America less manipulated by the rich and entrenched.
</P>
<P>
   The one who made the most lasting imprint on the presidential
campaign was John McCain, the feisty Arizona senator who has the
rare distinction of having emerged from imprisonment in Vietnam as
a valiant soldier of a war that produced few public heroes.
</P>
<P>
   McCain sought to revitalize the republic and the Republican
Party by urging reform of campaign fund-raising practices that have
become a continuing scandal in both parties, and by suggesting that
government deal more sternly with the tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
   He had the audacity to challenge Bush _ the candidate who had
been anointed as the party's standard-bearer by members of
Congress, governors and party professionals even before the
campaign began. In doing so, McCain charged down the campaign trail
like a latter-day Harry Truman, indulging in straight talk rather
than convoluted campaign rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   The second reformer, Bradley, a former basketball star and
senator from New Jersey, had less impact on the electorate. A
lanky, diffident one-time Rhodes scholar, the Democratic
presidential hopeful was less successful than McCain at
communicating with the people and energizing them.
</P>
<P>
   Like McCain, he urged reform of the system of campaign
fund-raising and preached the need to invest the nation with ``new
politics,'' although it was difficult to discern from his speeches
exactly what he meant by that. His most memorable accomplishment,
and one that Bush constantly emulates, was questioning Gore's
veracity.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a full-page advertisement that appeared in the
Washington Post commended Bradley for ``a valiant effort in a truly
just cause to make America a better place for all of us.'' The ad
was signed by seven couples, including basketball great Michael
Jordan and his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Since Bradley and McCain abandoned their campaigns after the
March 7 ``Super Tuesday'' contests, politicians and pundits have
been trying to figure out whether the campaigns will have any
long-range impact.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Bush began immediately to cultivate the supporters of
the vanquished. Both have made pitches for campaign fund-raising
reform, with Gore's proposal appearing to be closer to the more
sweeping changes sought by McCain. Bush, who has raised an
estimated $70 million, would ban some money from labor unions and
corporations but not from wealthy individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Americans have watched many insurgent campaigns flourish and
fade.
</P>
<P>
   In 1952, when Truman's administration was tarnished by scandals
involving White House regulars, the military stalemate in Korea and
assertions by Republicans that the U.S. government was brimming
with communists and communist sympathizers, Adlai Stevenson won the
favor of liberals with his eloquence and idealism.
</P>
<P>
   But Stevenson's campaign for the presidency in that year and
again in 1956 was doomed to failure because a personable and
popular military hero of World War II, Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower,
invaded the Republican Party and won its presidential nomination
over the solid opposition of the party's isolationist right wing.
</P>
<P>
   Goldwater, the colorful senator from Arizona, scored heavily in
1964 with the Republican right wing, which had grown weary of the
party nominating moderates for president. But his nomination split
the GOP and he was defeated badly by Lyndon Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   In 1968, Sen. Eugene McCarthy of Minnesota won the plaudits and
support of millions of Americans when he challenged Johnson's
Vietnam policy. Johnson, winning only a narrow victory over
McCarthy in the New Hampshire Democratic primary, withdrew from the
race.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Kennedy entered it, echoing McCarthy's anti-Vietnam
rhetoric. Had he not been assassinated, Kennedy might have gone on
to win the party's presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson is this: America admires reformers but does not
always elect them.

BY WHAT RIGHT ARE YOU GETTING YOURSELF A GUN?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CECIL JOHNSON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every week, mobster Tony Soprano drives onto the screens of
millions of American cable TV viewers, accompanied by rollicking,
raunchy background music that contains the refrain:
</P>
<P>
   ``Woke up this morning, got myself a gun, got myself a gun.''
</P>
<P>
   The song obviously is perfectly attuned to the character of the
boss Soprano because of how he earns his living and the things he
is sometimes obliged to do to keep on living.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Soprano and the real-life characters upon whom he is based
are not concerned in the least about the new national debate about
gun regulation triggered by the cheap shots taken recently by
National Rifle Association President Charlton Heston and NRA
Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre at President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   In a new television commercial, Heston suggests strongly that
Clinton lied about the NRA's efforts to block reasonable gun
control laws. Heston maintained that the president stymied the
legislation by refusing to compromise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Clinton, when what you say is wrong, it's a mistake. When
you know it's wrong, it's a lie. Remember?'' said Heston.
</P>
<P>
   It was painfully obvious that Heston was attempting to obscure
the substance of the issue by resurrecting the image of Clinton as
prevaricator-fornicator during the tawdry Monica Lewinsky business.
</P>
<P>
   LaPierre then sent shivers down the spines of some of even the
most fervent gun rights advocates when he accused the president of
needing ``a certain level of violence in this country ... a certain
level of killing to further his political agenda and his vice
president, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite those ad hominem attacks, Clinton appears more
determined than ever to push for what he calls ``common-sense gun
control,'' which would require:
</P>
<P>
   _ Background checks on sales at gun shows that could take up to
72 hours. The NRA wants such checks limited to no more than 24
hours.
</P>
<P>
   _ Trigger locks on new guns.
</P>
<P>
   _ A ban on the import of large-capacity ammunition magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Soprano, of course, would not be the least concerned about
incremental gun regulation that might evolve into gun confiscation.
Being an outlaw, he is comforted by the bumper stickers that
proclaim: ``When guns are outlawed, only outlaws will have guns.''
</P>
<P>
   That other bumper sticker about guns not killing people,
however, would strike him as absurd and an insult to his
intelligence. He knows that guns do kill people. People just point
them. More precisely, guns make killing people a lot easier,
whether accidentally or on purpose.
</P>
<P>
   But the gun worshipers keep reiterating that ridiculous refrain
like a mesmerizing mantra. The other mantra they keep chanting is
that the right of every American to wake up in the morning and get
a gun is enshrined in the Second Amendment to the U.S.
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Well, it's just not so, McGee.
</P>
<P>
   Either Heston and his crowd don't know that, which would mean by
his reasoning that they are mistaken, or they do know it and they
are lying to the American public.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, the Second Amendment does say that ``the right of the
people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.'' But that
comes after it says: ``A well-regulated Militia, being necessary to
the security of a free state ...''
</P>
<P>
   That first part is what the Hestons and LaPierres of this nation
like to gloss over. But the Supreme Court has said in no uncertain
terms that the first part is the crucial part.
</P>
<P>
   The court spoke emphatically and with impeccable logic in 1939
with its ruling in the case of United States vs. Miller. In that
case, the Supreme Court overturned the dismissal by a lower court
of charges against an Arkansas bootlegger for carrying a sawed-off
shotgun across state lines.
</P>
<P>
   The court said that the Second Amendment confers no individual
right to possess a firearm that does not have ``some reasonable
relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well-regulated
militia.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously a sawed-off shotgun flunked that test. But the
important part of that ruling was the interpretation of the Second
Amendment that tied it to the militia condition.
</P>
<P>
   That interpretation has stood for more than 60 years and has
filtered down through more than 100 appellate and lower court
rulings.
</P>
<P>
   But last year a federal district judge dismissed an indictment
against a Texas physician who brandished a gun in front of his
estranged wife and her daughter while he was under a restraining
order.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, it sounds ludicrous, but that judge concluded that the
doctor had a Second Amendment right to wake up in the morning, get
himself a gun and violate the terms of the restraining order.
</P>
<P>
   That ruling in the case of U.S. vs. Emerson stands about as much
chance of surviving the scrutiny of the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals as a Tony Soprano has of winning the Nobel Peace Prize.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the very fact that a federal judge could be so
mistaken _ influenced, perhaps, by NRA propaganda _ shows the
pernicious influence that the gun lobby is having on public opinion
and public policy by continuing to propagate the big lie that the
Second Amendment gives all of us the constitutional right to wake
up in the morning and get ourselves a gun.

 &HT;    Prognosis is gory for `Black Jack'
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Black Jack'' is the given name of a mysterious, possibly
unaccredited doctor for hire, with a scarred face and two-tone
hair. A master surgeon, for those who can afford his sky-high fees,
he swoops into action, scalpel in hand, muttering things like ``I
think the problem stems from the pituitary system.''
</P>
<P>
   In a sci-fi anime feature that equally likes action scenes and
gory surgeries, Black Jack investigates the crash-and-burn symptoms
of superathletes who broke world records two years earlier at the
1996 Olympics. He encounters a brainy, duplicitous female doctor
who knows more than she initially lets on, uncovers a medical
conspiracy and a lethal drug, and runs into activists working for a
group called Medical Soldiers for Justice.
</P>
<P>
   It's all very hard-boiled, except for when the movie focuses on
Black Jack's sidekick, an unbelievably annoying little girl named
Pinoko. A talky medical noir, this film isn't as visually
interesting as other animes. And it's the sort that lets one of its
dying characters deliver a long-winded explanation and personal
self-defense as her blood seeps into the sand.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, the flick is based on the manga by Osamu Tezuka.
</P>
<P>
   ``Black Jack''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   An anime feature directed by Osamu Dezaki. Unrated, but designed
for mature audiences.1 hour, 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: All hard-boiled action and gore.

 &HT;    `Emperor' complex but rewarding
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   As bloody as a Greek tragedy, as sweeping as a Kurosawa epic and
as humanly scaled as a Shakespearean drama, ``The Emperor and the
Assassin'' is quite an accomplishment. Why it wasn't nominated for
best foreign-language film suggests Oscar politics even more
byzantine than those on-screen here.
</P>
<P>
   Though it's too long and occasionally confusing (there's an
immense cast of power players), Chen Kaige's (``Farewell My
Concubine'') movie has the kind of panoramic impact and epic
flourish that the new generation of films using computer-generated
images lack.
</P>
<P>
   In 221 B.C., China consists of six rival kingdoms. Ying Zheng
(Li Xuejian), the king of Qin, decides to make the unification of
China ``a personal crusade.'' Away from the battlefield (where we
see that he is an efficient and brutal leader), this sounds rather
noble. As he tells Lady Zhao (Gong Li), a childhood friend who's
now his mistress, his vision is ``peace and prosperity for all with
one benevolent emperor.''
</P>
<P>
   She believes him. Or, more to the point, believes in him. So
much so that it's she who comes up with a strategy that will give
Ying Zheng license to invade and conquer a neighboring kingdom.
Namely by tricking another ruler into sending an assassin after
him. Only Lady Zhao will know who the assassin is and be able to
tip off her beloved before he's in too much danger.
</P>
<P>
   But here's where things get tricky. Lady Zhao eventually
witnesses what ``unification'' really means: cities on fire, piles
of corpses, children sacrificed by their own parents rather than
have them live as slaves in Qin.
</P>
<P>
   One further complication: As she becomes increasingly
disenchanted with her lover, she grows closer to her chosen
assassin. He's Jing Ke (Zhang Fengyi), a former lethal weapon who
swore off killing after a particularly brutal assignment.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the central story, there are plots and more plots _ a
vast network of ambition, betrayal and intrigue. Theater managers
would do their audiences a favor by handing out a chart as they go
in; it's that complicated.
</P>
<P>
   It helps that the cast is so strong. Gong Li, already familiar
to many Western movie-lovers, is flawless as the woman caught
between two very different men. Zhang Fengyi's assassin gives the
story heart and a doomed-samurai sense of nobility. But the
character who fascinates us is the emotional, childlike yet utterly
ruthless would-be emperor. His tunnel-vision juxtaposition of
power-lust justified by a higher goal seems all too recognizable
more than 2,000 years later.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Emperor and the
</P>
<P>
   Assassin''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   Starring Gong Li and Li Xuejian. Directed by Chen Kaige. Rated R
for violence. 2 hours, 40 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: The birth of a nation, Chinese style.

 &HT;    `Erin': Feisty mom vs. big business
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If Julia Roberts is already Forbes' richest media magnet, her
new movie, ``Erin Brockovich,'' will only make her richer and more
paparazzi-popular than ever.
</P>
<P>
   It's a Julia Roberts whom audiences have only rarely seen.
Remember ``Mystic Pizza''? In ``Erin,'' she's pure working class.
As a twice-divorced mother with one child on her hip and two in
tow, Roberts shines in the real-life story of a little-educated
California woman who, without a law degree but with a lot of pluck,
helps crash a big-time company responsible for devastating health
problems in a small, dirt-poor town.
</P>
<P>
   Part ``Norma Rae'' tossed with a bit of ``Working Girl,'' this
is Roberts' movie from the get-go. She clomps around in Candies
high heels and wears short-short skirts. She battles roaches
scurrying around her infested kitchen. She juggles creditors,
jiggles her breasts in tight-fitting sundresses to disarm men and
unleashes a steady stream of brash, often profanity-filled
put-downs at uppity people who get in her way.
</P>
<P>
   It's a star turn in a mostly believable and inspiring,
down-to-earth film. The jokes fly, and the drama's emotional level
ratchets up as our audacious heroine, a former Miss Wichita with
natural, unformed smarts but not much tact, bulls her way past
big-business blockades and stuffy-lawyer suits.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, the real Erin Brockovich, a divorced woman with three
small children and no legal training, walked into the law firm of
Ed Masry (portrayed in the movie with bumbling charm by Albert
Finney), uncovered a contaminated-water scandal in a real estate
file and eventually helped round up 600 plaintiffs in a hard-fought
case against $30 billion company PG&AMP;E.
</P>
<P>
   Like ``Norma Rae,'' it's a gritty, gutsy tale of pure human
tenacity. But it digs deeper than that Oscar-winning film, not only
in portraying its main character's relationship with men (in this
case, a sweet, longhaired biker played by Aaron Eckhart), but in
depicting the internal mommy war that often plagues women who
choose career over the stay-at-home life.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, Steven Soderbergh directs. One smart moviemaker, he has
a knack for punching up good material (``Out of Sight'') and making
other movies (``The Limey'') a lot better than they'd be in someone
else's hands. In ``Erin,'' he eschews the provocative, time-quirky
point of view that he used in both ``Out of Sight'' and ``Limey''
and settles for a more linear structure that fits the film's
hard-knocks morals.
</P>
<P>
   Soderbergh's camera also lingers at opportune moments to
increase ``Erin's'' emotional jolt. Plunging into workaholism, Erin
misses her baby's first words but is slowly reduced to tears while
driving home as her boyfriend tenderly relates the event as she
listens on her car phone. Later, there's a dynamite breakup scene
between Roberts and Eckhart that at first flips the genders in
life's age-old debate over work and family.
</P>
<P>
   At times, the movie can't seem to help itself and descends into
pat portrayals of book-smart lawyers completely out of their
element in the plaintiffs' rugged lives.
</P>
<P>
   But most of ``Erin's'' charm is Roberts. She has made acting
look easy in lesser roles in pinup-pretty movies such as ``My Best
Friend's Wedding'' and ``Notting Hill.'' Here, she more than proves
that she's got acting chops.
</P>
<P>
   And with the Oscars coming up in nine days, she's now primed to
arrive at the awards ceremony and, once again, command the
spotlight. It doesn't matter that she's not even nominated. She's
got ``Erin Brockovich.'' She's got game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Erin Brockovich''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Starring Julia Roberts and Albert Finney. Directed by Steven
Soderbergh. Rated R for profanity.
</P>
<P>
   2 hours, 11 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Julia Roberts delivers in a funny, down-to-earth
movie about an everyday mom with business spunk. Call it
``Working-Class Girl.''

 &HT;    East-West clash cloaks `Ghost' in edgy allure
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Ancient Japan was a pretty strange place,'' says dead-eyed
vamp Louise (Tricia Vessey) in director Jim Jarmusch's ``Ghost Dog:
The Way of the Samurai.'' The same goes for the film's version of
modern New York. After all, the emotionless Louise has just watched
her lover get shot to death, and she's addressing her comment to
his contract killer. She even lends him her copy of the book she's
reading: ``Rashomon.''
</P>
<P>
   The killer in question is Ghost Dog (Forest Whitaker), a
gun-for-hire who follows the philosophy of the samurai, especially
their utter devotion to their masters. His is the man who saved him
as a teenager from thugs: Louie (John Tormey), a tubby, graying
soldier working for gang boss Vargo (Henry Silva). Louise is
Vargo's daughter, so you could say the contract whack of her
boyfriend is an ultimate expression of parental disapproval. The
problem is, Louise wasn't supposed to be at the crime scene when
the hit occurred. So Vargo demands that Ghost Dog pay for his
mistake by being ``erased from the planet.''
</P>
<P>
   You might say he already is. He lives at an unknown address,
demands payment only once a year (the first day of autumn) and
contacts Louie via carrier pigeon. Incredulous, Vargo asks, ``Did
you try to follow this bird? Put a bug on it?'' (It bothers the
wise guys more than anything to learn that Ghost Dog is black.)
</P>
<P>
   What follows is a series of moves and countermoves as Ghost Dog
tries to stay loyal to Louie, even as Louie's cronies try to track
and kill him. It's a fairly equal match. Ghost Dog points out,
``We're from different ancient tribes, and now we're both almost
extinct.''
</P>
<P>
   With one droopy-lidded eye and the other sharp and clear,
Whitaker makes a fascinating lone wolf, radiating both outward
alertness and inward zen. Jarmusch places him in a pungently
off-key world: Thugs stare for hours at old kiddie cartoons, a
large boat rests atop a tenement roof, and a schoolgirl is busy
reading both ``The Wind in the Willows'' and the pulp-sex paperback
``Night Nurse.'' Jarmusch enjoys this sense of culture clash,
giving Ghost Dog a best friend from French Guiana (the lively
Isaach De Bankole); it hardly matters that neither of them
understands the other's language. As a tired Louie exclaims,
``Nothing makes any sense anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   As in his moody, kind-of western ``Dead Man,'' Jarmusch takes a
film genre and puts his own spin on it. His trademark restraint and
deadpan minimalism are at work, but they're used to re-imagine this
world of blood and vendettas in a fresh way. In this
``Sopranos''-mad year, it's to his credit that he takes the
overused gangster genre and makes it compellingly unfamiliar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ghost Dog:
</P>
<P>
   The Way
</P>
<P>
   of the Samurai''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Starring Forest Whitaker and John Tormey. Rated R for strong
violence and language. At AMC Phipps Plaza 14.
</P>
<P>
   1 hour, 54 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict:
</P>
<P>
   Director Jim Jarmusch puts his compellingly strange twist on the
mafia genre.

 &HT;    `Beyond Mat' pins down wrestling
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Vince McMahon, ubergod of cable's much-watched World Wrestling
Federation, doesn't like the new wrestling documentary ``Beyond the
Mat.'' Never mind that he agreed to be in it. That he allowed
cameras behind the scenes of his megabucks operation to film it.
That he let several of his popular slabs of prime beef _ including
superstar wrestlers Mick Foley (aka Mankind, Cactus Jack and Dude
Love) and the Rock _ be in it.
</P>
<P>
   No, McMahon has withdrawn his support of the film because, he
says, it isn't entertaining.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, but it is. It's also revealing, sickening and at times
enthralling. It grabs professional wrestling by the throat and
rarely lets go, pile-driving that trumped-up, we're-all-suckers
brand of ringside soaptainment and brutality. It's both a homage
and a wallop to wrestling, delivered with the same pointed
precision as the Rock putting his dreaded People's Elbow move on a
sprawled-out opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Director Barry W. Blaustein, an admitted wrestling fan and
former head writer and supervising producer of ``Saturday Night
Live,'' spent two years filming ``Beyond the Mat,'' tracking former
and current wrestling stars, peeking beyond the formidable walls of
the WWF, following beefy wrestler wannabes and taking a deep look
at the upstart organization Extreme Championship Wrestling.
</P>
<P>
   Within the WWF, Blaustein captures the defining moment of the
creation of Puke, a wrestler who can vomit at will. He follows
Terry Funk, an aging star with as many knee problems as
championship matches. And he ventures into ECW ``world
headquarters,'' which turns out to be a Northeastern suburban home
where a wrestling announcer shouts at least one must-see-us promo
as an elderly woman just off camera does the organization's daily
ironing.
</P>
<P>
   At its best, ``Mat'' explores the post-superstar life of
wrestler Jake ``The Snake'' Roberts. He's the guy who hauled a boa
constrictor into the ring for televised bouts and nearly four years
ago lost the Royal Rumble to Stone Cold Steve Austin. Now older,
fatter and less agile, Roberts works the rural wrestling circuit,
lives out of cheap hotels, talks about drug use and exhibits his
bizarre, psychologically unhealthy relationships with his father
and daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Almost as strange are the goings-on with Foley, who in the past
year has catapulted to the top of the WWF and written the
best-selling autobiography ``Have a Nice Day!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Beyond the Mat'' shows Foley's wife and his two frightened
young children ringside, witnessing one of his patented punishing
matches. The kids are agog as Foley exits the ring, his face
covered in blood, a gash in his head as big as California.
</P>
<P>
   Not to worry, he says. ``Daddy's got a boo-boo.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Beyond
</P>
<P>
   the Mat''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   A wrestling documentary directed by Barry W. Blaustein. Rated R
for profanity and violent content. At metro theaters.
</P>
<P>
   1 hour, 42 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Come smell what the Rock and his pals are cookin'.

 &HT;    Macs electronic and edible big hit in Costa Rican cafe
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, March 19.
 &HT;    By Ron Martz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEREDIA, Costa Rica _ From the outside, it looks like any other
McDonald's, golden arches and all, plucked out of Middle America
and plunked down in Central America.
</P>
<P>
   But on the inside, this McDonald's has some slightly different
combination meals. In addition to Big Macs, it has iMac computers.
And if you buy a combo meal and supersize those papas fritas, you
get 30 minutes of Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   Known as MiMac Cafe (``My Mac'' in Spanish), this McDonald's has
become increasingly popular with students from the National
University of Costa Rica just up the street in this suburb of the
capital, San Jose. But young businessmen also find it convenient to
stop in for a quick bite and some quick bytes, checking e-mail,
reading the latest news, or trolling for job opportunities. Parents
with young children also come here to see what the Internet is all
about.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually I go to an Internet cafe in San Jose, but this is
closer and I can come here to check my e-mail or when I need to do
some research while I get something to eat,'' said Antonio Nunez,
22, a second-year medical student.
</P>
<P>
   The 10 computers were installed five months ago when other
Americanized fast-food restaurants began popping up in the area,
said Grettel Gonzalez, hostess at the MiMac Cafe. Within a block
are a Burger King, a Kentucky Fried Chicken, a Papa John's Pizza
and a cyber-cafe that has drinks but no food.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was necessary for us to do something different to stay
competitive,'' Gonzalez said.
</P>
<P>
   Getting online here is as simple as ordering one of McDonald's
standard combination meals, including a McBurger Supreme or a
Cuarto de Libra (a quarter-pounder) and saying: ``Papas fritas
super.'' One of the online assistants provides a special code that
allows Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   Many Costa Ricans are Internet-savvy, Gonzalez said, but
McDonald's is sponsoring introductory courses at the university to
help students learn how to use it as a research tool.
</P>
<P>
   The MiMac Cafe's one big shortcoming, according to its regulars,
is that it has no printers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm doing research and I want to print out something, I
have to go to the cyber-cafe in San Jose,'' Nunez said.
</P>
<P>
   But probably with a supersized order of papas fritas to go.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Grades range from A to F.
</P>
<P>
   ``American Beauty'' R (strong sexuality, profanity,
</P>
<P>
   violence and drug content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Kevin Spacey
</P>
<P>
   and Annette Bening.
</P>
<P>
   8 Oscar nominations: picture, actor (Kevin Spacey), actress
(Annette Bening), director, original screenplay, cinematography,
film editing, original score. The ever-more-remarkable Spacey plays
a man caught in a midlife limbo in this scarily disturbing,
daringly hilarious, well-written and well-acted comedy-drama. It's
a hauntingly optimistic elegy for America the Beautifully Screwed
Up. (ERG)1 hour, 58 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``The Beach'' R (violence, profanity, sexuality,
</P>
<P>
   drug content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Leonardo DiCaprio
</P>
<P>
   and Virginie Ledoyen.
</P>
<P>
   A secondhand plot. Leonardo DiCaprio plays a restless young man
who travels with other aimless, privileged young people to a hidden
paradise _ then screws it up. It's hard to get attached to
characters who care about only one thing: their next moment of
pleasure. The cinematography makes the most of exotic locations.
But all the beauty in the world can't camouflage the film's
gorgeous emptiness. (SM)1 hour, 59 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``Being John Malkovich'' R (profanity and sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring John Cusack
</P>
<P>
   and Cameron Diaz.
</P>
<P>
   3 Oscar nominations: director, supporting actress (Catherine
Keener), original screenplay. It's a loopy original. John Cusack
plays a quirky file clerk who discovers a door that leads into the
noggin of actor John Malkovich. Toying with big concepts _ the
nature of identity, the lust for celebrity, sexual desire, the
illusion of free will, it's playfully profound one moment, gonzo
the next. And often hysterically funny. (SM) 1 hour, 52 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Beyond the Mat'' R (profanity and violent content)
</P>
<P>
   A wrestling documentary.
</P>
<P>
   Entertaining, revealing, sickening and, at times, enthralling.
Barry W. Blaustein's documentary grabs professional wrestling by
the throat and rarely lets go. His camera tracks former and current
wrestling stars, peeks beyond the formidable walls of the World
Wrestling Federation, follows beefy wrestler wannabes and takes a
deep look at the upstart organization Extreme Championship
Wrestling. (Bob Longino)1 hour, 42 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Black Jack'' Unrated (designed for mature audiences.)
</P>
<P>
   An anime feature
</P>
<P>
   directed by Osamu Dezaki.
</P>
<P>
   A sci-fi anime that's equal parts action scenes and gory
surgeries. The title character investigates the crash-and-burn
symptoms of super athletes, who broke world records two years
earlier at the 1996 Olympics. It's all very hardboiled, except for
when the movie focuses on Black Jack's sidekick, an unbelievably
annoying little girl named Pinoko. (SM)1 hour, 30 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Boiler Room'' R (profanity and drug content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Giovanni Ribisi,
</P>
<P>
   Vin Diesel and Ron Rifkin.
</P>
<P>
   A high-powered descendant of ``Wall Street'' and ``Glengarry
Glen Ross,'' this study of muscle-mouthed stockbrokers aiming to
make their first million before getting their first wrinkle pays
onscreen tribute to those two movies. It's a bracing reminder that
greed is still good _ so long as you don't get caught when you
pretzel the rules. (SM) 1 hour, 59 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Boys Don't Cry'' R (sex, profanity, nudity and violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Hilary Swank
</P>
<P>
   and Chloe Sevigny.
</P>
<P>
   2 Oscar nominations: actress (Hilary Swank), supporting actress
(Chloe Sevigny). This intense true story of Teena Brandon, a
21-year-old woman who believed she was a man. After cutting her
hair and reversing her name, she hung out with some hard-drinking
rednecks in rural Nebraska, which didn't work out. The movie is a
bit low-budget, but it's still a remarkable film. (ERG)1 hour, 54
minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cider House Rules'' PG-13 (nudity,
</P>
<P>
   substance abuse, violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Michael Caine
</P>
<P>
   and Tobey Maguire.
</P>
<P>
   7 Oscar nominations: picture, director, adapted screenplay,
supporting actor (Michael Caine), art direction, original score,
film editing. John Irving adapted his own novel. In the first half,
Dr. Larch (Caine) delivers babies and performs illegal abortions in
his Maine orphanage. In the second, less-engaging half, Larch's
protege, Homer Wells (Tobey Maguire), runs off to learn about the
world. (ERG)2 hours, 5 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Drowning Mona'' R (profanity and brief sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Danny DeVito,
</P>
<P>
   Bette Midler, Neve Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   As we get to know Mona (Bette Midler) through flashbacks, we
quickly understand why nobody is disturbed by her demise. It turns
out that the Yugo in which she took a header into the Hudson River
had its brakes sabotaged. Police Chief Wyatt Rash (Danny DeVito)
begins investigating her murder and finds that everyone in town had
something against Mona. (Hap Ernstein, Palm Beach (Fla.) Post)1
hour, 30 minutes. D
</P>
<P>
   ``The Emperor and the Assassin'' R (violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Gong Li
</P>
<P>
   and Li Xuejian.
</P>
<P>
   The birth of a nation, Chinese-style. Set in 221 B.C., Chen
Kaige's film tells the true story of how the would-be emperor of
all China sets about unifying the then-existing six kingdoms into
one. Though long and occasionally confusing, the movie has the
panoramic impact of a Kurosawa epic, the bloody violence of a Greek
tragedy and the human intrigue of a Shakespeare drama. (ERG) 2
hours, 40 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``The End of the Affair'' R (scenes of strong sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ralph Fiennes,
</P>
<P>
   Julianne Moore
</P>
<P>
   and Stephen Rea.
</P>
<P>
   2 Oscar nominations: actress (Julianne Moore), cinematography.
Neil Jordan's somber, velvety and often sensual adaptation of
Graham Greene's novel explores love both physical and spiritual.
While the movie doesn't skimp on humid clinches and bared skin, it
also summons up the intangible mysteries of sacrifice and devotion
to a higher power. (SM)1 hour, 49 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Erin Brockovich'' R (profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Julia Roberts
</P>
<P>
   and Albert Finney.
</P>
<P>
   Julia Roberts delivers in a funny, down-to-earth film about an
everyday mom with business spunk who, without a law degree but with
a lot of pluck, helps crash a big-time company responsible for
devastating health problems in a small, dirt-poor town. Call it
``Working-Class Girl.'' (Bob Longino)2 hours, 11 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Final Destination'' R (bloody violence and raw language)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Devon Sawa,
</P>
<P>
   Ali Larter and Kerr Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``Final Destination'' aims for young audiences with an
``X-Files: The Wonder Years'' science/suspense plot about a kid who
escaped death from a plane crash and learns more than mortals
should about death. Our hero (Devon Sawa) and six others find
they're still targeted for death. The Grim Reaper, feeling cheated,
has plans for them. (Chris Hewitt, Knight Ridder Newspapers)1 hour,
33 minutes. D+
</P>
<P>
   ``Ghost Dog:
</P>
<P>
   The Way of the Samurai'' R (strong violence and language)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Forest Whitaker
</P>
<P>
   and John Tormey.
</P>
<P>
   Director Jim Jarmusch takes the overused gangster genre and
makes it compellingly unfamiliar. Ghost Dog (Forest Whitaker), who
makes a fascinating lone wolf, is a gun-for-hire who follows the
philosophy of the samurai, especially their utter devotion to their
masters. His is the man who saved him as a teenager from thugs:
Louie (John Tormey), a tubby, graying soldier working for a gang
boss. (SM)1 hour, 54 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Girl, Interrupted'' R (profanity, drug content,
</P>
<P>
   sexuality and suicide)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Winona Ryder
</P>
<P>
   and Angelina Jolie.
</P>
<P>
   1 Oscar nomination: supporting actress (Angelina Jolie). Two
fine actresses, two fine performances. Based on Susanna Kaysen's
memoir about the two years in the '60s she spent at a mental
hospital, the movie goes for a rip-roaring tone reminiscent of
``One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.'' Winona Ryder steadies the
movie, but Jolie provides the fireworks as a charismatic sociopath.
(ERG)2 hours, 5 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Green Mile'' R (profanity, violence, sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Tom Hanks
</P>
<P>
   and Michael Clarke Duncan.
</P>
<P>
   4 Oscar nominations: picture, supporting actor (Michael Clarke
Duncan), adapted screenplay, sound. A manipulative but meticulously
crafted, absorbing and beautifully acted adaptation of Stephen
King's prison novel. Tom Hanks plays a 1930s death row guard whose
latest prisoner, a mysterious hulk played by Duncan, has mystical
powers of healing. (SM) 3 hours, 2 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Hanging Up'' PG (profanity and mild sexual themes)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Diane Keaton,
</P>
<P>
   Meg Ryan and Lisa Kudrow.
</P>
<P>
   Breezily written by the Ephron sisters and briskly directed by
Diane Keaton, the movie's ads want you to believe it's a
side-splitting sibling comedy about three sisters (Keaton, Meg
Ryan, Lisa Kudrow) trying to connect. However, it's really an aging
parent-confused adult child story in which Ryan tries to be all
things to her dying dad (Walter Matthau). (ERG) 1 hour, 32 minutes.
C+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hurricane'' R (profanity and some violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Denzel Washington
</P>
<P>
   and Vicellous Reon Shannon.
</P>
<P>
   1 Oscar nomination: actor (Denzel Washington). Washington
delivers his best performance in years as pugilist Rubin
``Hurricane'' Carter, the middleweight contender wrongly imprisoned
for nearly 20 years in a triple murder. Though ably directed, the
film contains some fabrications to tell this otherwise compelling
true story. (Bob Longino) 2 hours, 5 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``The Insider'' R (profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Al Pacino
</P>
<P>
   and Russell Crowe.
</P>
<P>
   7 Oscar nominations: Picture, actor (Russell Crowe), director,
adapted screenplay, cinematography, film editing, sound. Crowe, the
hot-tempered cop in ``L.A. Confidential,'' gives an astonishing
performance. He plays Jeffrey Wigand, a real-life cigarette
industry consultant who blew the lid off the tobacco industry. Al
Pacino plays the ``60 Minutes'' producer dogging the story. (ERG)1
hour, 37 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Magnolia'' R (profanity, drug use,
</P>
<P>
   sexuality and violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Julianne Moore
</P>
<P>
   and Tom Cruise.
</P>
<P>
   3 Oscar nominations: supporting actor (Tom Cruise), original
screenplay, song. A mesmerizing tapestry about broken families,
love and forgiveness. Unfolding at fever pitch and studded with
small miracles of acting, writer-director Paul Thomas Anderson's
movie is exhilarating and exhausting, the sort of thing you live
through as much as watch. The payoff is well worth it. (SM) 2
hours, 59 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``Mission to Mars'' PG ( sci-fi violence and mild language)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Gary Sinise,
</P>
<P>
   Tim Robbins, Don Cheadle.
</P>
<P>
   Brian De Palma's Red Planet opus is too much like other films
(``Contact,'' ``The Abyss'' and, especially, ``2001: A Space
Odyssey''), but it's still a decent popcorn movie packed with
thrills and sharp special effects. Gary Sinise, Tim Robbins, Connie
Nielsen and Jerry O'Connell are part of an astronaut team trying to
rescue others lost on Mars. (SM)1 hour, 53 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``My Dog Skip'' PG (violent content and mild profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Frankie Muniz,
</P>
<P>
   Diane Lane and Kevin Bacon.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the late Willie Morris' memoir about growing up in
small-town 1940s Mississippi, this family film is a remembrance of
how things can pass from our lives but never really leave us.
Nine-year-old Willie (``Malcolm in the Middle's'' Frankie Muniz) is
a shy only child whose life changes when his mom (Diane Lane) gives
him a Jack Russell terrier puppy, despite dad's (Kevin Bacon)
objection. (ERG)1 hour, 35 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Next Best Thing'' PG-13 (profanity, partial nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Madonna
</P>
<P>
   and Rupert Everett.
</P>
<P>
   The dialogue, the melodramatic situations, the performances all
scream ``Phony!'' Madonna and Rupert Everett play best pals (she's
straight, he's gay), who end up raising a child together. Some bad
movies, of course, are perversely enjoyable. This isn't one of
them. (Robert W. Butler, Kansas City (Mo.) Star)1 hour, 40 minutes.
D
</P>
<P>
   ``Next Friday'' R (profanity, drug use, sexual content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ice Cube
</P>
<P>
   and Mike Epps.
</P>
<P>
   A dumb comedy. The best that can be said for this sequel to
``Friday'' is that, unlike the first flick, the characters don't
spend most of the movie sitting on the front steps yakking and
getting stoned. They go elsewhere to get stoned. Lamely written,
it's a reminder that, while complex, mature and funny
African-American comedies are being made, there's always a market
for flatulence and dog poop jokes. (SM)1 hour, 33 minutes. D+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Ninth Gate'' R ( violence and sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Johnny Depp
</P>
<P>
   and Lena Olin.
</P>
<P>
   A major disappointment from Roman Polanski, the film stars
Johnny Depp in a tale of old books, the devil and the gateway to
satanic powers. Imagine one of those seasonal Halloween horror
houses, but designed by librarians. And what do you get at the end
of the trek? The spectacle of a bunch of rich twits in black robes,
play-acting a satanic mass. (SM)2 hours, 13 minutes. D+
</P>
<P>
   ``Perfect Blue'' R (animated sequences of violence
</P>
<P>
   and nudity, and profanity)
</P>
<P>
   An animated feature
</P>
<P>
   directed by Satoshi Kon.
</P>
<P>
   This animated feature isn't the usual sci-fi stuff but an
intriguing, twisty mystery that has more to do with the work of
live-action mind-game masters, like Alfred Hitchcock, Claude
Chabrol or Spain's Alejandro Amenabar (``Open Your Eyes''). (SM)1
hour, 20 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Pitch Black'' R (profanity and sci-fi violence and gore)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Vin Diesel
</P>
<P>
   and Radha Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   Hungry aliens, stupid humans: the usual. ``Pitch Black'' is just
the latest sci-fi rip-off of ``Aliens,'' packed with caricatures.
In the movie's last hour, writer-director David Twohy pretends to
explore his stick figures' moral choices, and he forgets to deliver
the thrills. (SM) 1 hour, 47 minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``Rear Window'' PG
</P>
<P>
   Starring James Stewart,
</P>
<P>
   Grace Kelly and Thelma Ritter.
</P>
<P>
   Alfred Hitchcock's 1954 classic is restored and re-released.
Jimmy Stewart and Grace Kelly star in a New York peep show of
suspected murder. Let's enjoy the movie for what it is: a sexy (if
sometimes sexist) chamber drama that gradually, expertly ups the
suspense to excruciating levels, all without breaking a sweat.
(SM)1 hour, 54 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Reindeer Games'' R (sex, violence, nudity, and profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ben Affleck,
</P>
<P>
   Charlize Theron and Gary Sinise.
</P>
<P>
   When it's good, it's very good, but when it's bad. ... Ben
Affleck plays an ex-con who poses as his former cell mate in order
to bed babelicious Charlize Theron and gets caught in a nasty mess
with her psycho brother (Gary Sinise), who wants him to help rob a
casino. With John Frankenheimer as the director, the movie is
always watchable, but sometimes it's just plain ludicrous. (ERG)1
hour, 45 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Scream 3'' R (profanity and strong horror violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring David Arquette, Courteney Cox Arquette and Neve
Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a scream anymore, but it's a decent wrap-up of the
series. Neve Campbell, Courteney Cox Arquette and David Arquette
are all back and on the Hollywood set of ``Stab 3,'' ducking the
knife-swings of a killer clad in the familiar Halloween get-up. The
new movie isn't as clever with its clues as the others, but it
manages to wheeze its way across the finish line, wrapping up the
trilogy in satisfying fashion. (SM) 1 hour, 56 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sixth Sense'' PG-13 (violent images)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Bruce Willis,
</P>
<P>
   Haley Joel Osment
</P>
<P>
   and Toni Collette.
</P>
<P>
   6 Oscar nominations: picture, director, supporting actor (Haley
Joel Osment), supporting actress (Toni Collette), original
screenplay, film editing. A surprising, spine-tingling gem.
Eight-year-old Cole (Osment) can see restless phantoms with their
skulls blown open. It's a fascinating, odd film that speculates on
what the relationship between the restless dead and a liaison to
the living world might be. (SM) 1 hour, 47 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Snow Day'' PG (mild peril and profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Chevy Chase.
</P>
<P>
   A lame kids movie about Syracuse, N.Y., schoolkids trying to
extend one out-of-school snow day into two. Chevy Chase plays a TV
weatherman suffering all kinds of humiliation and Chris Elliott
appears as the ominous Snow Plow Man with bad teeth. (Robert
Denerstein, Denver Rocky Mountain News) 1 hour, 30 minutes. D-
</P>
<P>
   ``Sweet and Lowdown'' R (profanity, sexuality and alcohol abuse)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Sean Penn
</P>
<P>
   and Samantha Morton.
</P>
<P>
   2 Oscar nominations: actor (Sean Penn), supporting actress
(Samantha Morton). This jazzy little doodle of a mockumentary is
middling Woody Allen and, as such, mildly likable once you get past
the insistent whiff of self-justification. Penn is superb as a
legendary (and fictional) jazz guitarist in the 1930s who's an
angel with a guitar in his hands and a louse the rest of the time.
(ERG)1 hour, 35 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Tigger Movie'' G
</P>
<P>
   Animated feature with
</P>
<P>
   Tigger, Pooh, Baby Roo, Piglet, etc.
</P>
<P>
   This charming animated feature clearly knows its intended tot
audience and takes care of them. The irrepressible, ever-bouncing
Tigger goes searching for his family and discovers his real family
isn't necessarily other Tiggers. Pooh, Piglet, Baby Roo and the
whole A.A. Milne gang are back, as are the Sherman brothers (``Mary
Poppins''), who wrote the sprightly songs. As Tigger himself would
say, it's tiggerific. (ERG)1 hour, 16 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``What Planet Are You From?'' R (sexual situations, profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Garry Shandling
</P>
<P>
   and Annette Bening.
</P>
<P>
   It's ``I Married a Stand-Up From Outer Space.'' A strangely
desperate and unfunny comedy about a galactically equipped alien
and his mission to breed with Earth women. Poor Annette Bening
plays one of the women; Garry Shandling, who also co-wrote and
produced this mess, is the R-rated extra-terrestrial. (Stephen
Whitty, Newhouse News Service)1 hour, 40 minutes. D
</P>
<P>
   ``The Whole Nine Yards'' R (sexuality, nudity, and violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Matthew Perry
</P>
<P>
   and Bruce Willis.
</P>
<P>
   A comedy with a body count and familiar mafioso premise, but
with enough twists to eventually overcome its familiarity. Bruce
Willis stars as a hit man. As in ``The Sixth Sense,'' he doesn't
seem to mind playing genial straight man to his funnier cast mates:
Matthew Perry, Patricia Arquette and Kevin Pollak. (SM)1 hour, 43
minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Wonder Boys'' R (profanity and drug content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Michael Douglas,
</P>
<P>
   Tobey Maguire
</P>
<P>
   and Frances McDormand.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Douglas plays scruffy, scattered English lit professor
Grady Tripp in director Curtis Hanson's (``L.A. Confidential'')
well-written version of Michael Chabon's novel. Part satire and
part coming-of-age tale of a man in his 50s, the film is full of
episodes and digressions that are as interesting as the final
destination. It's also a feast for actors, who make the most of
tiny, telling moments. (SM)1 hour, 57 minutes. B

 &HT;    Prom gowns take a shine to color in sweet, sexy, sophisticated
looks
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, March 19.
 &HT;    By Alma E. Hill
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The slogan for prom dresses this year: Less is more.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Young ladies will be wearing less fabric and showing more skin
in strapless gowns, two-piece formals with hip-hugging waistbands
and dresses with high slits or corset-tied backs.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Even some of the classic styles have less satin and tulle. For
example, ballerina skirts are not as puffy, especially when paired
with bustiers or spaghetti strap tops.
</P>
<P>
   But designers didn't skimp on color or fabric.
</P>
<P>
   The hot hues this year are lilac, silver, sky blue, pink,
periwinkle and burnished gold. White, black and silver metallics
are still cool. Look for matte crepe, satin, organza and, for those
who want to be really daring, a shiny, hologram vinyl.
</P>
<P>
   Dresses are accentuated with such details as embroided flowers
and trim, ethnic prints and rhinestones. Jewelry is understated,
perhaps because the gowns speak for themselves.

By TERESA McUSIC 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Move over, Tom Wolfe. A California banker has a tale that rivals
parts of your last great novel.
</P>
<P>
   And, unlike Wolfe's fiction-based-on-fact, this book is more
fact-that-reads-like-fiction.
</P>
<P>
   Its subjects _ from Donald Trump to Charles Keating to Peter
Ueberroth _ are as colorful and flamboyant and blindly ambitious as
any character Wolfe could contrive. Its story line is as serpentine
and unpredictable as a well-devised fictional plot.
</P>
<P>
   And the author is a true insider: Robert Smith, chairman of the
board and chief executive of Security Pacific, once the
fifth-largest bank in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The book is ``Dead Bank Walking: One Gutsy Bank's Struggle for
Survival and the Merger That Changed Banking Forever'' (Oakhill
Press, Winchester, Va., 426 pages, $27.95).
</P>
<P>
   This is banking in the go-go 1980s and the crash-and-burn
megamerger '90s. Smith chronicles this roller-coaster ride with
good writing, big-picture analysis and candor. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Smith attributes the good writing to his co-author, Mike
Crowley.
</P>
<P>
   For an example of how character, plot and good writing come
together, consider the first chapter, in which Smith meets with a
major Security Pacific borrower: Charles Keating. The real-estate
developer is looking for a savings and loan to buy, and Smith
innocently puts the idea of Lincoln Savings and Loan into Keating's
head.
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln later went down in flames, marking the most costly S&AMP;L
failure in history. Only later does Smith realize his error in
judgment, not only for Lincoln and the savings and loan industry,
but for his own bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``The transgressions of Keating served as the lightning rod for
Congress to enact new legislative changes that were a catalyst for
Security Pacific's downward spiral,'' Smith writes. ``Although
Security Pacific had barely begun its meteoric rise to fifth
largest bank in the United States, in many respects its path to
destruction was carved the moment Keating walked into my office. If
only I'd smelled the cheese of deceit in Keating and sent him
packing at that first meeting, our story and the stories of many
other banks might have turned out differently.''
</P>
<P>
   Keating was just one of the famous and infamous developers of
the '80s who marched into Smith's office seeking partners in a
deal. For Ueberroth, who was orchestrating a deal to buy Hawaiian
Airlines, Security Pacific financed $80 million and lost virtually
all of it.
</P>
<P>
   So as reckless as Keating must have looked to responsible
bankers, even responsible bankers were taking risks far beyond what
they had done before.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of whether Smith enabled a criminal, the exploits of
Keating and others caused Congress to react and substantially
change the way all banks and S&AMP;Ls work, particularly when valuing
real estate loans and participations. Security Pacific was heavy in
that area, and the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and
Enforcement Act of 1989 sent the S&AMP;L into a tailspin.
</P>
<P>
   Smith devotes the rest of the book to how his bank spent the
early '90s shrinking, then in 1993 merged with Bank of America, the
biggest merger to that time. Although Smith often slips more into
``banker talk'' during this final section, with attention to
``REO'' and ``basis points'' and other financial jargon, the story
maintains a fast pace.
</P>
<P>
   This book will truly entertain anyone who was in the industry at
the time, but as an insider's account of the second-most tumultuous
period in U.S. banking history, it also has wide general interest.

 &HT;    DAUGHTER KARENNA BRINGS SPARK OF YOUTH TO AL GORE'S CAMPAIGN
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington, (p) politics and (l) lifestyle
categories for release Sunday, March 19.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When Tipper Gore formally registered her husband's
presidential candidacy in New Hampshire last fall, she autographed
a poster marking the state's first-in-the-nation primary. ``The fun
starts here. New Hampshire rocks!'' she wrote.
</P>
<P>
   But the driving beat of the vice president's campaign has come
mostly from another brainy, beautiful blonde in the family _ Al and
Tipper's eldest daughter, Karenna Gore Schiff.
</P>
<P>
   She may be a political neophyte who was repelled by public life
as a youth, but 26-year-old Karenna now calls herself ``an extra
set of eyes and ears'' for her father's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   She is much more than that, however. She is, in the estimation
of The New York Times Magazine, ``the Golden Child'' of American
politics.
</P>
<P>
   Karenna's mix of earnest and cool has made her a favorite
stand-in for her father or mother at campaign events. Though eight
months pregnant, she even subbed for a hoarse Tipper to introduce
Gore when he announced his candidacy for the Democratic nomination
in Tennessee last summer. Eighteen days later, with perfect timing,
she gave birth to her son Wyatt on the Fourth of July.
</P>
<P>
   Karenna's cover girl looks and poise have made her invaluable to
fund-raisers for ``GoreNet,'' the Web-based get-out-the-youth-vote
effort she heads for her father.
</P>
<P>
   Karenna is becoming a role model for career women trying to
balance the demands of jobs and home, though her life is hardly
typical: she is a third-year student at Columbia Law School who
lives on the exclusive Upper East Side of New York City with
8-month-old Wyatt and her physician husband, Andrew, the scion of
banking and publishing empires in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   And, with her mother, Karenna is half of the inner circle the
vice president turns to for unfiltered, unvarnished advice on how
he is doing in his quest for the White House.
</P>
<P>
   It was Karenna and Tipper who told Al late last summer to move
his campaign headquarters to Tennessee and to get back to the
informal open meetings with voters that had been the basis of his
congressional campaigns. Otherwise, ``you lose,'' they said.
</P>
<P>
   Karenna has, in fact, taken on a campaign role normally reserved
for spouses, fathers, brothers and, occasionally, sons. Gore
campaign aides often compare the relationship to that of Jack and
Bobby Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's in a better place when she's around,'' Bob Squier, Gore's
longtime media adviser, told reporters before his death in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``A child who can go out and speak credibly about a parent
running for president, you don't see that very often,'' said Ryan
Karben, a New Yorker who worked with Karenna as a summer associate
at a Manhattan law firm.
</P>
<P>
   Her performance has been such that she is now the subject of
speculation about whether she will follow her father into the
family business.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, when asked if she would consider running for
Congress in 2002, she said, ``I wouldn't rule it out.'' In 2002,
her son will be 3, the same age she was when her father first ran
for Congress. He was elected on her birthday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no idea what options she'll consider or discard in the
future, but I'm very proud of her,'' Gore said of Karenna in a
recent interview. ``She really has perfect pitch, or very nearly
perfect pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   Karenna has three siblings: Kristin, 21, and Sarah, 20, both
college students, and Albert, 16, a sophomore in high school. All
three occasionally make campaign trips with their father, but dad
talks to Karenna nearly after night after campaigning to get her
take on his performance.
</P>
<P>
   The reason Gore says his daughter has only ``nearly perfect''
political pitch may be that she recruited her friend, feminist
writer Naomi Wolf, to the campaign last year. It was nearly a
disastrous move.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf's high-priced advice to Gore _ be the ``alpha'' male, wear
earth tones _ subjected the vice president to public ridicule and,
for some, confirmed their suspicions that Gore was artificial, the
product of polls and focus groups, willing to take on any persona
to win.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, it is this view of Gore as a humorless policy-driven
android that brought Karenna into the campaign. She wanted American
voters, especially other Gen-Xers, to know that her dad was
``really cool.''
</P>
<P>
   She told interviewers that his private nickname was ``Inspector
Gadget'' because of his love of technology, that he is a big fan of
Bob Dylan and the Grateful Dead, and that one of his favorite TV
programs is ``The Simpsons.''
</P>
<P>
   On a recent bus swing through Tennessee, she kept up a now
familiar drumbeat of the reasons people should vote for Gore:
``He's a visionary. He's a principled fighter. And he's a policy
pioneer. If you need a fourth, he's a really great dad.''
</P>
<P>
   Tipper had tried to give her husband the same kind of political
face-lift, but her efforts _ she described in one magazine
interview how Al slept in the nude _ largely fell flat.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, even though she played drums for an all-girl rock band
called ``The Wildcats'' in high school, Tipper just did not rock in
the minds of the hip and the cool.
</P>
<P>
   She had created the impression of a prudish, interfering
housewife with her crusade against lewd and violent rock lyrics in
the 1980s, a crusade that began after she heard a 14-year-old
Karenna listening to a song about ``Darling Nikki,'' whom Prince
sang that he had met ``in a hotel lobby masturbating with a
magazine.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She was ahead of her time,'' Karenna said of Tipper recently.
But during Karenna's adolescence, it was hard to be cool when mom
was routinely portrayed as a modern-day Carrie Nation, trying to
rid the world of raunchy rock.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very embarrassed at the time,'' she told The New York
Times last November. She recalled how the rapper Ice T had written
a song about Tipper that was ``upsetting'' to her. ``I wanted to be
cool, like a lot of 14-year-olds, and that definitely didn't
help,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Karenna's ``hippie'' phase began at the elite National Cathedral
School in Washington. It continued at Harvard, where she had a
reputation as a campus Deadhead, though her friends ranged from the
nerdy to the preppy.
</P>
<P>
   Today, she immediately connects with her audiences with the
observation that they all had ``lived through grunge.''
</P>
<P>
   After college, Karenna worked for a while at Slate, Microsoft's
online magazine. But her life changed dramatically in 1996 when she
was introduced to ``Drew,'' as her husband Andrew is known to
friends. Five months later, they were engaged.
</P>
<P>
   They were married at the Washington National Cathedral in the
summer of 1997, and at the conclusion of the ceremony, the bride's
late grandfather, Albert Gore Sr., still waiting to see a Gore in
the White House, stood and yelled, ``Joy to America!''

speculation about whether she will follow her father into the
family business.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, when asked if she would consider running for
Congress in 2002, she said, ``I wouldn't rule it out.'' In 2002,
her son will be 3, the same age she was when her father first ran
for Congress. He was elected on her birthday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no idea what options she'll consider or discard in the
future, but I'm very proud of her,'' Gore said of Karenna in a
recent interview. ``She really has perfect pitch, or very nearly
perfect pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   Karenna has three siblings: Kristin, 21, and Sarah, 20, both
college students, and Albert, 16, a sophomore in high school. All
three occasionally make campaign trips with their father, but dad
talks to Karenna nearly after night after campaigning to get her
take on his performance.
</P>
<P>
   The reason Gore says his daughter has only ``nearly perfect''
political pitch may be that she recruited her friend, feminist
writer Naomi Wolf, to the campaign last year. It was nearly a
disastrous move.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf's high-priced advice to Gore _ be the ``alpha'' male, wear
earth tones _ subjected the vice president to public ridicule and,
for some, confirmed their suspicions that Gore was artificial, the
product of polls and focus groups, willing to take on any persona
to win.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, it is this view of Gore as a humorless policy-driven
android that brought Karenna into the campaign. She wanted American
voters, especially other Gen-Xers, to know that her dad was
``really cool.''
</P>
<P>
   She told interviewers that his private nickname was ``Inspector
Gadget'' because of his love of technology, that he is a big fan of
Bob Dylan and the Grateful Dead, and that one of his favorite TV
programs is ``The Simpsons.''
</P>
<P>
   On a recent bus swing through Tennessee, she kept up a now
familiar drumbeat of the reasons people should vote for Gore:
``He's a visionary. He's a principled fighter. And he's a policy
pioneer. If you need a fourth, he's a really great dad.''
</P>
<P>
   Tipper had tried to give her husband the same kind of political
face-lift, but her efforts _ she described in one magazine
interview how Al slept in the nude _ largely fell flat.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, even though she played drums for an all-girl rock band
called ``The Wildcats'' in high school, Tipper just did not rock in
the minds of the hip and the cool.
</P>
<P>
   She had created the impression of a prudish, interfering
housewife with her crusade against lewd and violent rock lyrics in
the 1980s, a crusade that began after she heard a 14-year-old
Karenna listening to a song about ``Darling Nikki,'' whom Prince
sang that he had met ``in a hotel lobby masturbating with a
magazine.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She was ahead of her time,'' Karenna said of Tipper recently.
But during Karenna's adolescence, it was hard to be cool when mom
was routinely portrayed as a modern-day Carrie Nation, trying to
rid the world of raunchy rock.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very embarrassed at the time,'' she told The New York
Times last November. She recalled how the rapper Ice T had written
a song about Tipper that was ``upsetting'' to her. ``I wanted to be
cool, like a lot of 14-year-olds, and that definitely didn't
help,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Karenna's ``hippie'' phase began at the elite National Cathedral
School in Washington. It continued at Harvard, where she had a
reputation as a campus Deadhead, though her friends ranged from the
nerdy to the preppy.
</P>
<P>
   Today, she immediately connects with her audiences with the
observation that they all had ``lived through grunge.''
</P>
<P>
   After college, Karenna worked for a while at Slate, Microsoft's
online magazine. But her life changed dramatically in 1996 when she
was introduced to ``Drew,'' as her husband Andrew is known to
friends. Five months later, they were engaged.
</P>
<P>
   They were married at the Washington National Cathedral in the
summer of 1997, and at the conclusion of the ceremony, the bride's
late grandfather, Albert Gore Sr., still waiting to see a Gore in
the White House, stood and yelled, ``Joy to America!''

   MARKET (New York) _ Investors bought stocks furiously on
Thursday, sending the Dow Jones Industrial Average to its biggest
one-day gain since October 1987. At least for one day, the rally
put to rest fears that the Federal Reserve is pressing too hard to
slow the U.S. economy. As trading began Thursday, buyers flocked to
the old economy companies that make up the bulk of the stock market
and that have suffered for much of this year. Stocks of financial
companies such as American Express performed especially well, as
did shares of companies like airlines, whose profits are likely to
be strong if the economy stays healthy. But by mid-afternoon, the
buying had spread to new economy technology and Internet companies,
which have already posted strong gains this year. By the end of the
day, all segments of the market were sharply higher, with the Dow
Jones Industrial Average up 488 points, or 5 percent, to 10360, and
the Nasdaq composite index up 2.94 percent. By Alex Berenson.

   BMW-ROVER (Frankfurt, Germany) _ Six years and nearly $6 billion

deal to sell the remainder of Rover, its Land Rover line of sport
utility vehicles, to the Ford Motor Co. The giveaway of the car
business was stunning enough. But BMW's Land Rover deal with Ford,
which executives close to the talks said could be announced as
early as Friday, raised speculation that BMW might soon put itself
up for sale after years of fiercely maintaining independence, and
that Ford was a possible buyer. By Edmund L. Andrews.

 &HT;    Ha Jin's latest honor: PEN/Faulkner finalist
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Atlanta writer Ha Jin is on a roll. After winning the National
Book Award in November for his novel ``Waiting,'' the Emory
University professor has been selected as a finalist for the
prestigious 2000 PEN/Faulkner Award for fiction.
</P>
<P>
   The PEN/Faulkner Award is the largest annual juried prize for
fiction in the United States. The winner receives $15,000, and the
four other nominees each receive $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   Nominated along with Jin are Frederick Busch for ``The Night
Inspector,'' Ken Kalfus for ``Pu-239 and Other Russian Fantasies,''
Elizabeth Strout for ``Amy and Isabelle'' and Lily Tuck for ``Siam
or the Woman Who Shot a Man.''
</P>
<P>
   Ha Jin's novel traces Lin Kong's 18-year struggle to free
himself from an arranged marriage and marry the woman he loves in a
society designed to regulate his every move. It is also a
penetrating portrait of contemporary China.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Night Inspector,'' Busch follows maimed Civil War
veteran William Bartholomew as he battles to reconstruct a life for
himself in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pu-239 and Other Russian Fantasies'' is Kalfus' second
collection of short stories, all of which explore individual lives
during a century of Russian history. The title story follows a
doomed nuclear power plant worker as he sells a most unusual
package on the black market, a canister of weapons-grade plutonium
(Pu-239).
</P>
<P>
   In her first novel, ``Amy and Isabelle,'' Strout explores the
secrets of sexuality that jeopardize a mother-daughter relationship
when a teenage girl crosses the line with her math teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Tuck's third novel, ``Siam or the Woman Who Shot a Man,''
follows the fortunes of Claire, a 25-year-old bride from Boston, as
she adjusts to her new life in Thailand during early stages of the
U.S. bombing of North Vietnam in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   The winner will be announced in April. All five authors will be
honored May 13 at the 20th PEN/Faulkner Award ceremony at the
Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Music and marinades: Ricky Martin is the latest celebrity to
step into the kitchen. The Latin sensation is shopping around a
cookbook with recipes from Casa Salsa, the restaurant he owns in
Miami. With bids expected in the high six figures, the publishing
action is likely to be as hot as the recipes.
</P>
<P>
   Other celebrity cookbooks already on the market include Patti
LaBelle's ``LaBelle Cuisine: Recipes to Sing About'' (Broadway,
$25), Sara McLachlan's ``Plenty: A Collection of Sarah McLachlan's
Favourite Recipes'' (Madrigal, $24.95), and Trudie (Mrs. Sting)
Styler's ``The Lake House Cookbook'' (Potter, $35).
</P>
<P>
   The recipes range from LaBelle's ``Over-the-Rainbow Macaroni and
Cheese'' and McLachlan's ``Writer's Block Oatmeal-Raisin Cookies''
to Styler's ``Rolled Lamb with Chile Sauce and Mole.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Short-term memories: Teen pop diva Britney Spears' memoir is
due out in May from Three Rivers Press. Yes, a memoir. Written with
the help of her mother, Lynne, the book is touted as an
inspirational tome. Coincidentally, it's also scheduled to hit
stores at the same time as her new CD.

 &HT;    Volume explores `Souls' of folk art
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, March 19.
 &HT;    By Catherine Fox
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Souls Grown Deep,'' the 1996 Olympics exhibition of art by
Southern African-American self-taught artists, was a landmark
survey of its subject, and a revelation.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes ``Souls Grown Deep,'' the book. Sure to be a landmark
as well, the hefty tome is the first of at least three volumes that
aim to provide a comprehensive exploration of this complex art
form. At 544 pages, with reproductions of works by 100 artists and
photographs of environmental art as well as 40 artist profiles and
essays by 35 contributors, Volume 1 is an impressive start.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first volume is an introduction to the field,'' says
Atlantan William Arnett, who has championed the art for 15 years
and conceived the book in 1987. ``We want to bring people up to
date.''
</P>
<P>
   To that end, it sets out a historical context. Scholars note
African influences on African-American artists. Early forms of
African-American object-making _ funerary art, charms, quilts _ are
discussed as antecedents. U.S. Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.), who
contributes an essay, sees the connection between the civil rights
movement and the flowering of this art in ``this whole desire to be
liberated, not just from physical barriers but being free of spirit
and free of mind.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's important for the American community to know
about this art,'' Lewis says. ``It's ordinary people being very
creative, doing what they can using their hands and minds.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Souls'' is encyclopedic but not an encyclopedia. Instead of
organizing the book alphabetically or chronologically, Arnett and
son Paul, who are executive editors, chose to arrange the profile
section according to the materials the artists use: stone, wood
(including roots), paper, canvas, found objects.
</P>
<P>
   They took great pains to include essays from authors with a
broad spectrum of viewpoints and specialties. All of them came to
Atlanta to review the Arnetts' extensive collection of the material
and met as many of the artists as possible. Artists write where
possible, or are interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   Planned for wide distribution in late spring, the book is
already getting a strong response. It aroused unusual enthusiasm
when the Museum of American Folk Art debuted it at the Outsider Art
Fair in New York in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had 100 books and sold every one of them,'' says Marie
DiManno, director of museum shops for the New York facility.
``People are coming in the shop just for the book. They're asking
to be notified when the second volume comes out. Dealers, students
_ everyone is buying it. It's becoming a must-have.''
</P>
<P>
   The book can be ordered online for $95 at
www.soulsgrowndeep.org. It is also available at the High Museum of
Art gift shop (404- 733-4505).

 &HT;    Hot sounds take pop charts by storm
 &HT;    By Shane Harrison
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's hot, it's sexy and it's bursting with Latin flavor.
</P>
<P>
   No, we're not talking about that skimpy Versace dress Jennifer
Lopez wore at the Grammy Awards. We're talking about the U.S. pop
charts.
</P>
<P>
   They may not get the respect of the tradition-laden Cuban sound
of the Buena Vista Social Club, or the much admired jazz of Texas
percussionist Poncho Sanchez, but Ricky Martin, Enrique Iglesias
and Marc Anthony are loved by U.S. pop fans with a gusto that
eluded such earlier crossovers as Puerto Rican pop phenoms Menudo
or the Spanish duo Los del Rio. (Their ``Macarena'' was a smash hit
in 1996, but it has since become as big a pop culture punch line as
Milli Vanilli.)
</P>
<P>
   Not only did Latin sabor dominate the Grammy ceremony on Feb. 23
_ with performances by Martin, Anthony and the Buena Vista Social
Club and a trunkful of awards for guitarist Carlos Santana _ but
the National Academy of Recording Arts &AMP; Sciences unveiled some
rather startling news that night. Pop songstress Christina Aguilera
and actor Jimmy Smits made the announcement that on Sept. 15, for
the first time ever, there will be a Latin Grammy Awards in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   This is no attempt to ghettoize, but an acknowledgment of the
fact that Latin music is dominating the pop charts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing this because it's time, and not because of the
popularity of Ricky Martin or anyone else,'' says Adam Sandler,
vice president of communications for NARAS. He was in Mexico City
recently, reassuring the musical communities in Latin America that
the move will benefit the entire spectrum of acts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The community down here has been very concerned that the
awards would be about the most popular artists,'' he said. ``But we
can recognize an album that much of the general public has never
heard. That's one of our goals, to give exposure to artists that
otherwise might not be heard by the general public.''
</P>
<P>
   Next on the radar screen: Colombian siren Shakira and hunky
Mexican singer Luis Miguel, both of whom have conquered Latin
audiences and are being pitched as the next Ricky.
</P>
<P>
   What a difference a generation makes.
</P>
<P>
   It used to be that an exotic touch guaranteed only that an
artist wouldn't be taken seriously by mainstream radio. Hits from
Hispanic artists peppered the pop charts through the years, but
many were fads (remember the lambada, the ``forbidden dance''?).
</P>
<P>
   A hop in the way-back machine traces other inroads. In the 1940s
and '50s, Carmen Miranda parlayed her film success into a musical
career, recording her samba-drenched music and appearing on ``The
Jimmy Durante Show.'' Meanwhile, bandleaders such as Xavier Cugat
(the one-time Mr. Charo, with whom Miranda recorded), Desi Arnaz
and Mongo Santamaria added a touch of tropical jazz to popular
music. It would continue sporadically into the early '60s, with
hits from Stan Getz and Astrud Gilberto's version of Antonio Carlos
Jobim's ``The Girl From Ipanema'' to Eydie Gorme's airy ``Blame It
on the Bossa Nova.''
</P>
<P>
   On the rockier end of the spectrum, a teenage Ritchie Valens
took ``La Bamba'' onto the charts in 1959 _ but a month later, the
man who might well have been the first enduring Latino rock star
died in a plane crash.
</P>
<P>
   Spanish rock quintet Los Bravos had a 1966 hit with ``Black Is
Black,'' but then it was Santana's turn to give the San Francisco
scene a taste and climb into the Top 10 with ``Evil Ways'' and
``Black Magic Woman'' in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   The disco era, with its rhythmic focus, brought back a little
Latin touch to popular music, though artists such as Santa
Esmeralda, the Salsoul Orchestra and Kid Creole and the Coconuts
were a bigger presence in club land than chart land.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, that suave, smooth Spaniard Julio Iglesias landed two
duets in the Top 40, one with Willie Nelson and the other with
Diana Ross. His albums would continue to sell large numbers, but
haven't scaled the U.S. pop charts since.
</P>
<P>
   Then came Gloria. Cuban-born vocalist Gloria Estefan's Miami
Sound Machine was a hit-making operation that landed seven songs in
the Top 10 between late 1985 and the summer of 1988. Estefan's solo
career, commencing with 1989's chart-topper ``Don't Wanna Lose
You,'' boasts its own string of hits.
</P>
<P>
   Like Valens before her, the Tejano singer Selena didn't live to
see her career take off on this side of the border _ though she was
a star in Mexico. Shot by the president of her fan club in 1995 at
age 23, she might have taken her blend of ranchera, country, pop
and polka to the top of the American charts.
</P>
<P>
   Today's stars _ particularly Martin and Anthony _ appeal to both
Latin and American audiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the shows, Marc Anthony sings salsa, too,'' says Sammy
Zamarron, program director of local Latin radio stations WLBA-AM,
WAOS-AM and WXEM-AM. ``He caters to both markets and gets the best
of both worlds.''
</P>
<P>
   The Latin American market has been good to these performers, and
they're not about to forsake it for U.S. sales. The increase in the
Hispanic population _ locally and nationally _ makes that a good
strategy. The U.S. Census Bureau recently forecast that Hispanics
will replace African-Americans as the nation's largest ethnic
minority group within five years; they already outnumber blacks in
21 states.
</P>
<P>
   CNN.com reported in February that American retailers spent more
than $291 million in 1999 for albums and videos by Latin artists _
an 11 percent increase from the year before and also the fifth
straight year that sales of Latin artists have risen.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people are seeing that there is a growing market,
that Hispanics do spend money,'' says Zamarron. Then he laughs.
``And they have a good beat.''
</P>
<P>

&HT;     JURY AWARDS $26 MILLION FOR MAN HURT IN ROLLOVER CRASH 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By PETER HARTLAUB  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A jury has awarded a San Francisco insurance
executive and his wife more than $26 million after his Ford Bronco
II rolled over and left him a quadriplegic.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the Ford Motor Company said they would ask a judge
to reduce or throw out the award, and may appeal the verdict.
</P>
<P>
   If the verdict stands, lawyers for Richard and Dana Raimondi say
it may be one of the largest against the automaker in Bronco
rollover cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a horrible, horrible injury and no amount of money can
make up for that,'' said Paul D. Nelson, one of the Raimondis'
attorneys. ``I think the jury did its best to be fair and the
Raimondis are happy to have the process finished.''
</P>
<P>
   The Alameda County Superior Court jury awarded Richard Raimondi,
57, almost $39 million in compensatory damages. Dana Raimondi, who
was not in the car, was awarded $13 million.
</P>
<P>
   But the jury, which heard the case in Hayward, Calif., also
found that Richard Raimondi was 50 percent responsible for his own
injuries. It was unclear whether the ruling will effect Dana
Raimondi's award.
</P>
<P>
   The jury did not award punitive damages in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Warren Platt, a lawyer representing Ford, maintained that driver
error caused the accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think there's any evidence that the vehicle caused
the rollover,'' Platt said.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit was filed after a 1996 accident on Interstate 880 in
Fremont. Raimondi, who had just bought the 1988 Bronco II, swerved
to avoid an object in the road.
</P>
<P>
   After hitting the concrete center divider and another car, the
Bronco rolled over three times, lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get in that kind of situation, virtually any vehicle
will roll over,'' Platt said.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The evidence showed that the Bronco II is the most dangerous
sports utility vehicle, certainly in modern times,'' Nelson said.
</P>
<P>
   Raimondi uses a ventilator to help him breathe. Nelson said his
medical expenses prior to trial exceeded $2.6 million and are
expected to total more than $14 million over his lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   The jury of six men and six women reached a decision Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Ford built more than 700,000 Bronco IIs from 1973 to 1990. The
model was replaced by the Explorer. Lawyers for the plaintiff claim
the narrow wheelbase and high center of gravity make the vehicle
susceptible to rollovers.
</P>
<P>
   Ford has settled more than 650 rollover claims involving the
Bronco II, Nelson said. He said about a dozen have gone to trial,
where Platt said most plaintiffs have lost.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, a Missouri jury awarded $295 million to the families
of a couple and their son who were killed in a rollover of a 1978
Bronco.

`FINAL DESTINATION': TEENS SKIP A DOOMED FLIGHT , MEET THEIR MATCH
ON THE GROUND 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes are at end of review) 
(af) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The grinning voice of John Denver caroling ``Rocky Mountain
High'' may never again seem quite so innocent once you've consumed
``Final Destination,'' the leaden teen-age horror film in which the
song is repeatedly used to announce the arrival of death (with a
capital D).
</P>
<P>
   The first time you hear the anthem by the perky folk-pop singer,
who died in a plane crash, it is being piped over the sound system
at Kennedy Airport minutes before Alex Browning (Devon Sawa), a
jittery high-school senior, is to board a jet for Paris on his
class trip.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks, Alex has been having premonitions of disaster, and as
he quakes with terror in a men's room stall, the Denver song sneaks
into the background to taunt him with the reminder that what goes
up must come down.
</P>
<P>
   Once aboard the plane, Alex is seized by a fantasy (the movie's
scariest scene) in which the aircraft, seconds after takeoff,
shudders with a death rattle as an explosion rips through the
cabin, creating pandemonium. Berserk with panic, Alex snaps out of
his nightmare and screams that the plane is going to crash, even
though it still hasn't left the gate.
</P>
<P>
   Hastily escorted back to the terminal, he ends up one of seven
who stay behind. When the plane carrying most of his classmates
finally takes off and seconds later explodes in midair, killing
everyone aboard, Alex is shattered but not surprised.
</P>
<P>
   The disaster and Alex's premonitions set up a heavy-handed fable
about death and teen-age illusions of invulnerability. Having
cheated death, Alex and his six fellow survivors discover that the
Grim Reaper is in a major snit. And for the rest of the movie, the
Grim Reaper sets about picking them off, one by one.
</P>
<P>
   But if you imagined that death would dispatch them as quickly
and efficiently as possible, think again. Being a teen-age horror
film, ``Final Destination'' is not about to let anybody go gentle
into that good night.
</P>
<P>
   The executions are staged like elaborate magic tricks, in which
commonplace bathroom and kitchen items malevolently turn against
their owners. A toilet spontaneously springs a leak, spreading a
bluish water across the bathroom tile and under the feet of a young
man shaving. The slippery tile sets up a Rube Goldberg-like chain
of pratfalls that culminate in a grotesque self-strangulation.
</P>
<P>
   In the most complicated sequence, vodka leaking from a cracked
mug seeps into a computer, which explodes, cutting its victim's
throat with a flying piece of metal. As the kitchen catches fire, a
knife slides off a counter plunging into the victim's heart.
Ultimately, the house explodes as if it were a gasoline storage
tank.
</P>
<P>
   These sequences have a smirking gallows humor worth a couple of
chortles, since the Grim Reaper's lethal antics suggest nothing so
much as a spoiled teen-ager throwing a prolonged fit. The movie is
especially fond of electrical wiring that runs amok, with loose
wires that hiss and thrash and spit sparks in the presence of
gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   But even by the crude standards of teen-age horror, ``Final
Destination'' is dramatically flat. Sawa's teen-age clairvoyant is
colorless and charisma-free. And Ali Larter is equally pallid as
the empathetic girlfriend who feels his pain. The movie is so busy
rigging its stunts that it forgets its teen-agers aren't just
sitting ducks; they're people, too. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `Final Destination' is rated R (under 17 requires accompanying
parent or adult guardian). It is quite gory. &QL;

`INVENTING AL GORE': TOTING THE MERIT BADGES   OF A BOY SCOUT
CANDIDATE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publication notes appear at end of review.) 
(DW) 
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In outline at least the Al Gore who emerges from Bill Turque's
thoughtful new biography will be familiar to anyone who has
followed print and television coverage of his vice presidency and
the opening rounds of the 2000 campaign: a cautious politician who
frequently seems programmed, despite labored efforts to retool his
image with a ``game-show host wardrobe'' and a high-decibel
congeniality; an often awkward man whose Boy Scout persona belies a
slashing braggadocio and a Clintonesque taste for double-talk and
self-promotion.
</P>
<P>
   What Turque, a Washington correspondent for Newsweek, has done
in ``Inventing Al Gore'' is to amplify this portrait of the vice
president with lots of details and a carefully considered appraisal
of his career. There isn't much that's actually new in this book,
save the claim of two former friends that Gore was an
``enthusiastic recreational user'' of marijuana through the early
1970s, which was already cited in Newsweek's recent excerpt from
this book.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part Turque simply focuses on contradictions and
flip-flops in Gore's record and reviews his continuing efforts ``to
convince the world, and perhaps himself, that he was his own man,''
that he has emerged, at long last, from the shadows of his father,
Sen. Albert Gore of Tennessee, and more recently, Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Groomed since childhood to be a politician on the national
stage, Gore early on developed a careful, reflexive style. That
operating style, Turque observes, has ``remained largely intact for
nearly 25 years,'' from his days in the House of Representatives
and the Senate through his current tenure as vice president: ``a
relentless work ethic; tactical caution; passionate advocacy of
worthy but low-risk issues; and a willingness to revise, or simply
muddy up, politically inconvenient positions.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's zigzagging on issues is a recurrent theme in Turque's
biography, a book that, despite its judicious tone, draws an often
damning picture of the vice president as a hypocrite, driven by a
curious mixture of duty, loyalty and cold political calculus. This
is a man, Turque writes, who believed the Vietnam War was wrong but
enlisted in 1969 to protect his father's political career and
guarantee his own viability within the system. This is a man who
believed that Bill Clinton's behavior in the Monica Lewinsky affair
was indefensible but who nonetheless took up the role of
cheerleader, hailing his boss as one of our greatest presidents in
history.
</P>
<P>
   In his first race for Congress in 1976, Turque writes, Gore ran
``a campaign carefully trimmed of the dissident liberalism'' that
had ended his father's career, reinventing himself ``as a
conservative on several hot-button issues.'' He opposed additional
gun registration laws and declared shortly before primary day that
he did not ``believe a woman's freedom to live her own life, in all
cases, outweighs the fetus' right to life.''
</P>
<P>
   Echoing Bill Bradley's suggestion that the vice president has
not always come clean about the evolution of his views, Turque
writes that Gore's ``turnabout on abortion remains the most
dramatic shift of position in his career.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Gore declared during this year's New Hampshire primary
that he had ``always supported a woman's right to choose,'' Turque
points out that he had once been ``a reliable `pro-life' vote in
the House'' with ``an 84 percent rating from the National Right to
Life Committee'': he supported a version of the Hyde Amendment,
which barred federal assistance in ending pregnancies that resulted
from rape or incest; and in 1980 he voted to prohibit women
employed by the federal government from choosing health insurance
that covered abortion under any circumstance.
</P>
<P>
   An element of hypocrisy has informed Gore's stands on other
issues as well, says Turque. He observes that Gore continued ``to
take contributions from cigarette manufacturers and grew tobacco''
on his Tennessee farm for seven years after his beloved sister,
Nancy, died of lung cancer, though he would later memorialize her
at the 1996 Democratic convention as a victim of the cigarette
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Turque also contends that for all Gore's passionate evangelism
about the environment he has demonstrated ``a pattern of passivity
and timidity on environmental policy'' as vice president,
relegating the beliefs he laid out in his book ``Earth in the
Balance'' ``to a separate intellectual account, above and apart
from his political life.''
</P>
<P>
   On the matter of Gore's involvement in 1996 campaign finance
scandals, Turque rehashes other reporters' findings but comes up
with little new evidence, writing simply that the vice president's
``usually circumspect instincts had been flattened by the money
hunt.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's eagerness to become the Democrats' ``solicitor in
chief,'' he suggests, stemmed in part from memories of watching his
father go down to defeat after being badly outspent in his last
Senate campaign, in part from being ``a creature of Washington''
with an inner circle ``dominated by lawyers and lobbyists immersed
in the city's money-and-influence culture.''
</P>
<P>
   So what sort of president would Al Gore make? On this question
Turque, like his subject, is cautiously fuzzy. He writes that two
themes would probably surface in a possible Gore administration:
``faith in the blessings of science and technology'' and a
commitment to civil rights. He points out that as vice president
Gore was often quicker than Bill Clinton ``to favor military force
as an option,'' and that under his stewardship, the ``Reinventing
Government'' initiative made some significant reforms but also
appeased interest groups and deferred tough questions.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly his style would differ significantly from Clinton's.
Turque observes that where Clinton ``was famously malleable,
constantly assimilating opposing views, appeasing political
enemies, and shifting positions,'' Gore tends to be more combative.
On the one hand, this means ``he brings a quality of directness''
to negotiations; on the other, it means he tends to ``lecture and
browbeat.''
</P>
<P>
   Turque quotes one former State Department official as saying:
``I think Gore believes you can shame other people into doing
things. With Gore, it's more `I know better.' Clinton, for all his
115,000 faults, saying `I know better' is not one of them.''

`THE DISAPPEARANCE OF FINBAR': A TEENAGER   VANISHES, AND THAT'S
JUST THE START 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes are at end of review) 
(af) 
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Among the prerequisites for enjoyment of ``The Disappearance of
Finbar'' is a taste for the shaggy dog story.
</P>
<P>
   In telling the tale of the consequences of a feckless Irish
teen-ager's disappearance, this English-Irish-Swedish
co-production, directed and co-written by Sue Clayton, wanders from
the slums of Dublin to the tidiness of Stockholm to the pale glory
of the Arctic Circle.
</P>
<P>
   It travels a long way. Much of the trip is intriguing. Some of
it is funny. Some of it splendidly scenic. But neat resolution is
not to be found at the end of the road.
</P>
<P>
   Acted by an appealing cast, enlivened with well-chosen and
varied music and filmed with bleak beauty by the cinematographer
Eduardo Serra, ``The Disappearance of Finbar,'' which opens Friday
in New York, is propelled by the puzzle it poses at its outset:
what has become of Finbar Flynn (played by Jonathan Rhys Meyers),
the hopeless young loser last seen by his worried friends late one
night as he bounced a soccer ball along the narrow edge of an
overpass above a busy highway? Is he dead or alive?
</P>
<P>
   Although the mystery of Finbar's fate and the geography of his
pursuit by his best friend, Danny Quinn (Luke Griffin), exercise a
beguiling magnetism, neither of the principal characters proves
sufficiently complex to evoke a profound emotional response.
</P>
<P>
   But Fanny Risberg as Abbi, the abandoned beauty living with her
musical-loving grandmother, Johanna (Sif Ruud), in Lappland, is
drawn and realized with a depth that makes her pain and longing
palpable.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Clayton's film, written with Dermot Bolger and
adapted from Carl Lombard's novel ``The Disappearance of Rory
Brophy,'' makes the most of its riddle, spices its travels with
deft humor that includes a running joke about the origins of the
tango and introduces some striking characters, from musicians in an
Irish cowboy band to an addled Irish grandpa with his own tale of a
disappearance to a Chinese couple in a Stockholm apartment and to
the hoary, menacing denizens of a bar in the frozen north.
</P>
<P>
   As for Finbar himself, he is at the pinnacle of his young life
when first encountered. A promising soccer player, he is off to try
out for a team in Zurich with the cheers of his neighbors in his
desolate, littered public housing development ringing in his ears.
</P>
<P>
   He is back soon enough, unable to take the pressure. ``You'll
never get out of this hole,'' his angry father tells him.
</P>
<P>
   Even Finbar knows the prospects are unlikely. Embittered by his
vision of his future and indifferent to his education, he has taxed
the patience of his schoolteacher to the point where she calls him
a ``self-opinionated intellectual pygmy.'' And he has pronounced
himself bored with the sexual favors of Katie (Lorraine
Pilkington), the girl Danny adores.
</P>
<P>
   For three years after the night of Finbar's disappearance, there
is no word of him. Danny is traumatized and angry at the suffering
Finbar has caused. The community is anguished. Roche, the police
detective assigned to the case, remains patient, although Finbar's
mother is devastated and Danny's mother worries that her son might
also vanish.
</P>
<P>
   Finbar Flynn has become part of lore and one night, after a
ballad about him makes its way to video, Danny receives a mocking
call from his old friend, who says he is in Stockholm.
</P>
<P>
   By the next day, Danny, too, has vanished from his home, bound
for a confrontation with his old friend. &QL;

   Idle Worshiper
</P>
<P>
   Q. My elderly father-in-law, who is handicapped, has always been
active in his synagogue. The new rabbi, in an effort to more
strictly interpret religious law regarding vehicular travel on the
Sabbath, has closed the handicapped parking area so worshipers will
not drive. This prevents many disabled congregants from attending
activities. How do you balance access for the handicapped with
religious edicts?
</P>
<P>
   _ Linda Watts Broun, Washington
</P>
<P>
   A. For the strictly Orthodox, it is better not to go to the
synagogue at all than to drive on the Sabbath, and so your
father-in-law seems stuck in an intractable situation. He may,
however, have more options than you realize.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes there are extenuating circumstances,'' says Rabbi
Samuel Intrator of the Carlebach Shul, an Orthodox congregation in
New York. ``He should discuss it with his rabbi and see if a
dispensation could be found, respectful to the community and his
special needs. For instance, perhaps a non-Jew might drive him to
the synagogue.''
</P>
<P>
   Your father-in-law's rabbi is obviously not trying to
discriminate against the disabled. No one is compelled to obey
Jewish law, and attendance at synagogue is voluntary. Your
father-in-law chooses compliance, and attendance. In that sense he
is not a victim of injustice.
</P>
<P>
   However, while the intent of the parking policy is not
discriminatory, its effect is. And even when membership and
obedience are voluntary, no group is exempt from ethical scrutiny.
Some Boy Scouts object to their organization's exclusion of
homosexual Scoutmasters. Members of many religions criticize their
faith's refusal to ordain women; i.e., to treat all congregants
equally. A precept's being based on religious belief does not give
it special ethical status.
</P>

   Furthermore, it is possible to embrace a body of beliefs but
reject a particular edict. Such conflicts can lead people to reform
an organization, secular or sacred. Religious practice is not
immutable; all faiths have altered over the centuries. Rabbi David
Lincoln of the Park Avenue Synagogue, a Conservative congregation,
offers this advice: ``Conservative Judaism is the answer _ a
traditional service and plenty of parking.''
</P>
<P>
   However, your father-in-law does not seem inclined to leave his
congregation. And you do not seem to have a principled objection
based on rights for the disabled as much as a desire simply to get
him to shul. I'd look for ways to do that.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Recently I had a phone message from a reference-checking firm
about a colleague in another department. He is a first-class
producer, and my company will suffer a real loss if he leaves. On
the other hand, I have nothing but respect for him and would like
to be of service. Should I return the call and give this person the
high reference he deserves? Or should I place my employer's
interests first and not return the call.
</P>
<P>
   _ Anonymous, Cleveland, Ohio
</P>
<P>
   A. You should give your co-worker the praise he deserves: this
is simply a matter of honesty. With luck, he won't leave your
company. He may not be offered the job. And even if it's offered,
he may decline it, particularly if his current boss gives him
enough of a raise to keep him where he is.
</P>
<P>
   But in any case, that's not your call. Your colleague is not an
indentured servant; he's entitled to change jobs. And I suspect
you'd feel dreadful if you thwarted him.
</P>
<P>
   One last guideline - when evaluating ways of keeping your
co-worker in place, a tactic is probably unethical if it involves
epoxy or similar industrial adhesives.

 &HT;    POLITICAL TICKER: Proof of the pudding?

Cox staff and wire reports.)

<P>
   Al Gore, in Maryland addressing an organization that lobbies for
investment in low-income neighborhoods and for improved credit for
such residents, criticized George W. Bush's tax cut plan Thursday
as ``economic snake oil'' that would imperil prosperity, take money
from social services and perhaps put the government back deep in
debt. Gore noted that Congress refused a day earlier to act on a
budget plan similar to Bush's proposal for across-the-board tax
cuts. ``Now, if it is so risky that even the group that Newt
Gingrich ushered into the Congress will not vote for it, you know
it is risky indeed,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   1996 FUND-RAISING BACK TO HAUNT
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department, with a new prosecutor, Robert Conrad,
running the campaign finance task force, is moving to bring
money-laundering charges against some of the remaining defendants
in the 1996 fund-raising scandal, the Wall Street Journal reported
Thursday. The effort could complicate the campaigns of Al Gore and
Hillary Clinton. Money-laundering charges could be lodged against
Thai-born businesswoman Pauline Kanchanalak and her sister-in-law,
Duangnet ``Georgie'' Kronenberg, who were indicted in 1998 on
charges of funneling more than $600,000 to the Democratic Party
from foreign sources.
</P>
<P>
   ARMS LENGTH AFTER HAND-TO-HAND FIGHTING
</P>
<P>
   There won't be a quick shake-and-make-up between John McCain and
George W. Bush. McCain's advisers have taken offense at a New York
Times interview in which Bush refused to reach out to McCain. The
interview was viewed by the McCain staff as a sign that Bush has no
intention of making concessions to his former GOP rival. They said
it also makes an endorsement of Bush less likely, although McCain
would eventually be willing to help Bush if he shows respect for
McCain and his campaign-finance cause, advisers said.
</P>
<P>
   DIFFERENT AREAS, DIFFERENT THEMES
</P>
<P>
   Abandoning talk of gun control, Al Gore touted himself as a
friend of unions, families and working class Americans at a
suburban Pittsburgh high school _ and criticized George W. Bush.
But earlier in Philadelphia, on the other side of the Pennsylvania,
he talked about his proposals for gun control _ a theme not
discussed later in the more conservative western part of the state.
</P>
<P>
   SO MUCH FOR DIVERSITY
</P>
<P>
   The Education Department has acknowledged that a former
third-grade teacher from Iowa invited to an Education Department
seminar on promoting diversity described George W. Bush and Florida
Gov. Jeb Bush as racists. Jane Elliot, who also is an author, was
at the department March 8 to deliver a presentation on how children
become prejudiced. Elliot also advised employees attending the
seminar not to vote for Republicans. ``The comments were
spontaneous and unanticipated,'' said department spokeswoman Erica
Lipping. Elliott received about $7,500 for participating in the
department's speaker's series on diversity.
</P>
<P>
   JESSE SHOULDN'T HOLD HIS BREATH
</P>
<P>
   Neither Al Gore nor George W. Bush should expect Jesse Ventura's
endorsement without paying a price, the Minnesota governor said. To
win him over, a candidate would ``have to sever from being a
Republican or Democrat,'' Ventura said on MSNBC. The former
wrestler predicted that John McCain would be elected president if
he ran as an independent.
</P>
<P>
   IT DOESN'T TAKE VERY LONG SOMETIMES
</P>
<P>
   John McCain's campaign communications director says his
candidate made ``three major mistakes'' at the end. Dan Schnur,
speaking at Harvard, said the first mistake was to compare George
W. Bush to President Clinton in ads in South Carolina. The second
mistake was the phone calls to Catholic voters in Michigan, which
``allowed Bush to turn questions about (Bob Jones University) from
himself to our own campaign tactics. ... Even worse, we lied about
it, too. ... It really hurt our credibility.'' The last major
mistake was McCain's criticism of Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell.
``For 10 months, we ran as near a perfect campaign as we could have
. . . but in seven days we melted down,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   BOB JONES BACK TO BASICS
</P>
<P>
   Bob Jones University President Bob Jones III has reposted
statements against Catholics and Mormons on the fundamentalist
school's Web site. Jones said he wanted to show nothing had changed
about his views on Catholicism after it was reported earlier this
week that the message in the ``President's Corner'' no longer
referred to Catholicism and Mormonism as cults. The message was
cited repeatedly after George W. Bush was criticized for speaking
on campus Feb. 2.
</P>
<P>
   FIRING BACK AT THE NRA
</P>
<P>
   A day after wrapping up the Republican presidential nomination,
George W. Bush distanced himself from the National Rifle
Association, saying it went too far in its recent attacks on
President Clinton. Seeking a middle ground on gun control, Bush
disagreed with the NRA's recent assertion that Clinton accepts gun
violence because he wants to use it as a political issue. ``I
thought they were wrong in saying the president condones killing,''
Bush told Knight Ridder Newspapers in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   LINCOLN NEVER SLEPT THERE, DID HE?
</P>
<P>
   Trying to allay a growing controversy, campaign officials for
George W. Bush released a list of all of his overnight guests at
the Texas Governor's Mansion. Bush's list showed the mansion has
been opened to relatives, longtime friends and Republican
officials, not fund-raisers. But the watchdog Center for Public
Integrity released a separate study saying that 60 of the 131
guests had contributed or raised more than $2.2 million for Bush's
presidential campaign. Douglas Hattaway, a spokesman for Al Gore,
said Bush has ``a lot of explaining to do about his behavior in his
presidential campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   NEW KENNEDY CHALLENGER POPS UP
</P>
<P>
   Republican Jack E. Robinson III, 39, a former Eastern Airlines
executive now running a cellular phone company, will run this fall
for the seat that Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.) has held for 37 years,
said Plymouth County District Attorney Michael Sullivan, who is
bowing out after a six-month exploratory campaign. The Boston
Herald reported that an announcement by Robinson is imminent.
</P>
<P>
   `TERM LIMITS' GREAT WHEN YOU'RE NOT IN OFFICE
</P>
<P>
   A conservative radio show host, Richard Clear, 51, is
challenging Rep. George Nethercutt (R-Wash.) for the Republican
nomination, mainly because of the congressman's about-face on term
limits. Nethercutt is seeking a fourth two-year term despite a
pledge in 1994 to serve only six years. Nethercutt became a hero of
the term-limits movement when he ousted 15-term Democratic
incumbent and then-House Speaker Tom Foley in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   KEEP THOSE WALKING SHOES HANDY
</P>
<P>
   No one can recall the last time a first lady marched in one of
New York's parades, but this first lady is turning up with the
regularity of a baton-twirler. Two weeks ago, Hillary Clinton
marched in an early St. Patrick's Day parade in Queens. Today she
is scheduled to walk up Fifth Avenue in the main St. Patrick's Day
extravaganza. She also plans to take part in the Million Mom March,
an anti-gun event on Mother's Day, as well as the Gay Pride parade
in June.
</P>
<P>
   PARTY CORES: THEY'RE DEPENDABLE _ AND THEY VOTE
</P>
<P>
   The voters who turned out to help George W. Bush clinch the GOP
presidential nomination were mostly Protestant or evangelicals,
white, Republican and over age 50. For Al Gore, they were more
likely to be women, black, Catholic and also middle-aged. They are
the most dependable voters, those who go the polls under any
circumstance to back their candidates even, as was the case
Tuesday, when the race was pretty much already decided.

&HT;     RENO SAYS SHE IS RELUCTANT TO RELEASE FUNDRAISING MEMO 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARK HELM  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Attorney General Janet Reno, responding to
accusations she is covering up White House campaign fund-raising
violations, said Thursday that she probably won't make public the
recommendations of her top advisers on the case.
</P>
<P>
   One of those advisers, Charles LaBella, who headed the Justice
Department's campaign fundraising task force, reportedly accused
his superiors in a 1998 memo of going through legal ``contortions''
to avoid coming to the conclusion that Reno should seek an
independent investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at her weekly news conference, Reno said releasing the
LaBella memo would ``hamper'' future attorney generals by making
department lawyers wary of giving fully ``candid'' advice because
of fears their opinions would be made public.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some wonderful lawyers in this department who I want
to make sure will continue to give their best advice without the
thought that it will be spread all over, everywhere,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., chair of the House Government Reform
Committee, has subpoenaed the LaBella memo and another memo written
by FBI Director Louis Freeh, which called for an independent
counsel to investigate White House fund-raising activities during
the 1996 presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter that accompanied his subpoena, Burton accused the
attorney general of ``crippling'' his investigation into the
matter.``You tried to keep the committee from learning how you had
mishandled the investigation,'' he wrote. Reno promised to ``work
with Congress in every way possible,'' but declined to say if she
would allow Burton to see the memos.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are reviewing the subpoena carefully now,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the Los Angeles Times quoted the LaBella memo as
saying Justice Department officials used ``gamesmanship'' and legal
``contortions'' to avoid an independent inquiry into White House
fund-raising matters.
</P>
<P>
   In the memo, LaBella reportedly recommends that Reno appoint an
independent counsel, saying the probe needed to look at ``the
entire landscape'' of campaign finance practices, ``conjured up by
sophisticated political operatives to circumvent'' election finance
laws during President Clinton's re-election campaign.The newspaper
said the LaBella memo accused top Justice Department officials of
using ``intellectually dishonest'' double standards by endorsing
independent counsels to investigate Cabinet-level officials _ while
opposing the appointment of counsels to investigate Clinton, Vice
President Al Gore, first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and former
White House aide Harold Ickes. Ickes is a top adviser to Mrs.
Clinton's Senate campaign in New York. Although not commenting on
specific charges in the memo, Reno downplayed LaBella's strong
language and his questioning of the motives of her top aides.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want (Justice Department) lawyers to be able to debate, to
discuss, to be able to use, if they so choose, language that they
think might make their argument more effective,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, a federal jury convicted Maria Hsia, a
longtime political Gore fundraiser, on five felony counts for her
role in arranging more than $100,000 in illegal donations to the
Democratic Party and its candidates in 1996. Of that amount,
$55,000 was contributed to the Democratic National Committee in
connection with the vice president's much-criticized visit to a
Buddhist temple in the Los Angeles area. The event, at the Hsi Lai
Temple in Hacienda Heights, has shadowed Gore throughout the
current political season, with a variety of his opponents using it
to remind voters of the Clinton-Gore campaign's fund-raising
embarrassments. The verdict made Hsia, an immigration counselor
from Los Angeles, the major catch thus far in the Justice
Department's investigation of campaign finance abuses. &UR;  &LR;  &QL;

EXPLOSIVES LINKED TO PARAMILITARY GROUPS SEIZED NEAR BELFAST 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By WARREN HOGE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The Ulster police arrested three men and seized 500
pounds of explosives that were being transported to Belfast on
Wednesday night after being tipped off to bomb plots organized by
paramilitary groups opposed to the Northern Ireland peace
settlement.
</P>
<P>
   The seizure took place when two cars under surveillance were
stopped by Royal Ulster Constabulary officers on a highway eight
miles outside Belfast. The men were held for questioning.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking as police officers put plastic bags of bomb-making
materials on display at a West Belfast police station Thursday,
Chief Inspector Ken Henning declined to identify the group the
arrested men were thought to belong to but said, ``We believe the
people responsible are connected to dissident republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   In Northern Ireland, republicans are those, largely from the
Catholic minority, who wish to see the British province linked more
closely with Ireland. The dominant republican paramilitary force,
the Irish Republican Army, is observing a ceasefire, but splinter
republican groups at odds with this stance have pledged to bring
down the peace accord signed in April 1998. One of them, called the
Real IRA, blew up the center of the town of Omagh in August 1998,
killing 29 people in the worst single case of violence in the past
three decades of sectarian conflict, which have caused more than
3,600 deaths.
</P>
<P>
   The intercepted bomb plot was seen as an effort to disrupt
faltering negotiations at a moment when representatives of the
IRA's political wing, Sinn Fein, and all the other principals in
the effort to end the bloodshed in Northern Ireland are meeting in
Washington on the fringes of the St. Patrick's Day celebrations at
the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Progress halted when the power-sharing home rule government that
is the centerpiece of the peace settlement was suspended by London
on Feb. 11 after the IRA failed to make moves to start disarming.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting vacuum has left Ulster in an increasingly volatile
state, with so-called punishment beatings by both Protestant and
Catholic paramilitary groups and threats of violence by renegade
guerrilla groups on the rise. The police on both sides of the
border between Ireland and Northern Ireland have had success in
recent months confiscating chemicals and timing devices used in
bombs, but several plots have eluded the security forces.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Last month a hotel in Irvinestown in County Fermanagh was badly
damaged in a fire-bomb attack, a bomb partly exploded close to
sleeping quarters in the British army base at Ballykelly in County
Derry and a primed rocket launcher was found on the perimeter of
another base in Dungannon in County Tyrone. None of the attacks
caused injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the seizures Wednesday night, the head of the Royal
Ulster Constabulary, Sir Ronnie Flanagan, went ahead Thursday with
an announcement that 500 British soldiers are being withdrawn from
the province because of improving security. The reduction of
British forces in Northern Ireland has been cited by Ireland, which
with Britain is a co-sponsor of the peace talks, as an important
confidence-building measure in the effort to resume progress in the
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The battalion going home is from Belfast, where there has been
no military patrolling since 1998. When they return to England next
month, troop strength in Northern Ireland will dip below 14,000,
down from 30,000 at the height of ``the troubles'' in the 1970s.

THIS `DOG' IS A KILLER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With so few original ideas out there, some directors are
deciding that the best film route is one that crosses paths with
many genres. The Wachowski brothers did it with ``The Matrix,''
blending science fiction, martial arts and action inspired by Hong
Kong films; David O. Russell did it with ``Three Kings,'' merging
``The Treasure of Sierra Madre,'' ``Gunga Din'' and ``MASH'' and
tossing them into a Persian Gulf War story.
</P>
<P>
   Now Jim Jarmusch is doing it with ``Ghost Dog: The Way of the
Samurai,'' in which Jarmusch appears to be after the all-time
cinematic cross-pollination. ``Ghost Dog'' lifts from Japanese
literature, ``Sopranos''-style gangster dramas, spaghetti westerns,
hip-hop and urban dramas, French films, classic cartoons and The
Simpsons' 'toon-within-a-'toon, ``Itchy &AMP; Scratchy.'' Jarmusch
sprinkles it with his typically quirky characters and laid-back
rhythms; it's not for everyone _ which with an oddball like
Jarmusch is like saying that naked motorcycle riding isn't for
everyone _ but it's unusually entertaining for those who are game.
</P>
<P>
   Forest Whitaker, heavy-lidded and tight-lipped, plays Ghost Dog,
a samurai-inspired contract killer who prefers solitude, living on
a rooftop with his coop of carrier pigeons. When Ghost Dog was
younger, a mobster (John Tormey) saved his life, so Ghost Dog
pledges eternal loyalty to him; that becomes trouble when the
mobster asks the hit man to execute a ``made man,'' considered an
untouchable mob figure. Ghost Dog does the deal, and brings down
the wrath of many odd _ and none-too-bright _ mob types.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, ``Ghost Dog'' is a standard revenge story, but
Jarmusch doesn't treat it like one. He loads the movie with quotes
from ``Hagakure: The Book of the Samurai'' and gives Ghost Dog some
benevolent friends in a French-speaking ice-cream man (Isaach de
Bankole) and a young girl (Camille Winbush) who's trying to
understand the killer's ways.
</P>
<P>
   Jarmusch puts the emphasis on humor and mood, with a big help
from The RZA's atmospheric hip-hop soundtrack. Pacing has never
been Jarmusch's strength, but ``Ghost Dog'' moves quickly, although
it does pile on a few too many climaxes. But Jarmusch's ability to
toss all these ingredients into his cultural stew without making
mush is admirable; some folks won't like the taste, but it goes
down easy if you're in the right mood.

IS THIS A FINAL ANSWER IN TEEN-GORE GENRE?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TODD CAMP 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OK, you gotta admit that even for adamant horror fans,
``Scream'' and its imitative ilk of pretty-teens-in-peril pictures
are getting kind of tired. With ``I Know What You Did Last Summer''
and ``Urban Legend'' sequels waiting in the shadows along with
Keenen Ivory Wayans' parody of the subgenre, ``Scary Movie,'' due
in theaters soon, there aren't a whole lot of original spins left
on gutting teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, have any of the cast members from Fox and The WB's teen
shows not starred in one of these things yet?
</P>
<P>
   Not that that slowed down the producers of ``Final
Destination,'' who, to their credit, manage to wring out a few
drops of originality for their addition to the teen body-count
equation.
</P>
<P>
   You have writer/director James Wong and writer/producer Glen
Morgan to thank for that. If those names sound familiar, it's
because you recognize them from some of the best episodes of Fox's
``The X-Files,'' along with ``Millennium, Space: Above and Beyond''
and NBC's new ``The Others.''
</P>
<P>
   Wong and Morgan actually scare up quite a few surprises, even if
the territory is all too familiar. The story is worthy of the
original ``Twilight Zone'' series with Devon Sawa (''Idle Hands'')
as Alex, a nervous high schooler preparing for an overseas field
trip. When he dreams of the plane exploding during takeoff, his
subsequent hysterics get him and several of his friends ousted from
the flight. But when the jet actually does go up in a fireball,
everyone suspects that he may have had a hand in the accident.
</P>
<P>
   The real trouble is that Alex and his pals were supposed to have
died on the flight, and when the survivors start dropping dead,
most under unusual circumstances, it appears as if Death is out to
complete its design, unless Alex can unravel its pattern.
</P>
<P>
   The characters are stock: Ali Larter (''Varsity Blues'') is
Alex's loner love interest; Kerr Smith (''Dawson's Creek'') is the
angry jock who resents his savior; Chad E. Donella (''Disturbing
Behavior,'' ``The X-Files'') is Alex's lecherous best friend, and
Tony Todd (''Candyman'') is the spooky undertaker.
</P>
<P>
   But the film's most creative attributes are the ways it
dispatches its stars; some go in a bizarre Mousetrap series of
actions that come off like a supernatural salute to Rube Goldberg,
while others go in ways so shocking and quick, it left preview
audiences gasping.
</P>
<P>
   It's better than you think, but not as good as you hope.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``None of us expected the Asian fair to be the huge
success it's been since Day 1,'' said Khalil Rizk, director of the
Chinese Porcelain Co. in Manhattan. He was one of the instigators
of New York's International Asian Art Fair, which opens on Thursday
night and runs through March 29 at the Seventh Regiment Armory.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came up with the idea in 1994 because we were concerned
that Asian art was losing its appeal in America,'' Rizk said.
``Everything we sold went abroad. We were all asking ourselves how
we could renew interest in Asian art and attract young new
collectors.''
</P>
<P>
   He met with Brian and Anna Houghton, the English couple who
organize many art fairs in New York. ``The idea was to schedule a
fair at the same time as the Asian auctions,'' Houghton said.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Ellsworth, the acknowledged dean of New York's Asian art
dealers, said, ``Three dealers made it possible.'' He was too
modest to say that he was one of the three, but once he signed on,
the Houghtons knew they could produce a fair.
</P>
<P>
   This year the fair has 61 dealers from eight countries,
including China. Houghton said there will be more Japanese
antiques, early Chinese bronzes and antique textiles than in the
past.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's significant about the Asian art market is that it is
dominated by dealers, not auction houses,'' Rizk explained. ``At
the fair you see very little that has been at auction before.
That's why the museum interest is huge. Last year on opening night
80 curators were lined up with their trustees. When do you see
that? Whether you are a curator, a dealer or a collector, if you
are a serious participant in the Asian art market, you cannot
afford to miss the fair.''
</P>
<P>
   Rizk will exhibit a dramatic Chinese figure from the Northern Qi
period (A.D. 550 to 577). The unglazed pottery official is 55
inches tall and has a fierce expression on his face. He is a tomb
guardian, standing at attention, hands clasped over his chest.
</P>
<P>
   Ellsworth will show an eighth-century A.D. Tang dynasty silver
box made as a gift to the imperial Chinese household. He also has a
group of fourth-century B.C. bronze deer from China. Forming a
complete set of finial mounts for the canopy of a horse-drawn
carriage, they have huge ears that seem to be flopping as they
gallop.
</P>
<P>
   A London dealer, Linda Wrigglesworth, a new participant, is
showing an embroidered yellow satin emperor's dragon robe from the
18th century. Uragami Sokyu-Do of Tokyo is exhibiting 18th- and
19th-century Choson dynasty blue-and-white ware from Korea. M.D.
Flacks, one of the few dealers showing furniture, has a sublimely
simple late-17th-century huanghuali altar table from China. These
are only a few of the participants in Asian Art Week, a misnomer as
it is actually two weeks of auctions, parties, openings, shows and
fairs that attracts collectors from Asia and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   It starts Saturday with a loan exhibition, ``Treasures From
Ancient Beijing,'' at Christie's in Rockefeller Center. On Monday
Doyle's Asian art auction includes 20 paintings from the collection
of Anna C. Chennault. She is the widow of General Claire L.
Chennault, commander of the Flying Tigers, American volunteers who
flew audacious air raids against the Japanese in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Among the many shows at private galleries is one opening Monday
at J.J. Lally &AMP; Co. Oriental Art, 41 E. 57th St., Manhattan. This
show of ancient Chinese ceramics and tomb sculptures has neolithic
pots from 6000 B.C. that look amazingly modern. ``You must realize
this is before the appearance of figural materials,'' said Jim
Lally, the gallery owner, referring to a melon-shaped vessel
resting on three short pointed feet. ``It is one of the earliest
Chinese ceramics in America.''
</P>
<P>
   The oxidized red vessel has smooth sides and two lug handles
pierced with holes. ``It's very rare because it is so
sophisticated,'' he said. ``It is curious a potter would go to such
lengths for a storage vessel. Was it made for a specific function
or for status? We don't know. It's clearly more artful than is
necessary.''

   He has a neolithic pottery beaker that looks like a beer stein,
circa 4500 B.C. to 2500 B.C. It is white because it is made of
Kaolin clay. ``If it were fired at a higher temperature, it would
be porcelain,'' Lally said, pointing out the eggshell-thin sides.
``We don't know if it was meant to be used. It may have stood on an
altar to be appreciated by the gods.''
</P>
<P>
   Lally's show is timely. On Tuesday ``Dawn of the Yellow Earth''
opens at the China Institute in America in Manhattan. This
exhibition will include 63 ancient Chinese ceramics from 5000 B.C.
to 300 B.C.
</P>
<P>
   Lally also has several Chinese dancing female figures made about
200 B.C. The unpainted dancers were put in tombs to honor the
occupants. ``Each shows a frozen movement in a ritual dance,'' he
said. ``After death you would enter a mirror world with the same
laws of status and hierarchy you left behind. That's why you needed
an entire retinue.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuseppe Eskenazi, the London dealer, is showing at
PaceWildenstein, 32 East 57th Street, Manhattan, beginning on
Monday. Like Ellsworth he has ancient bronze fittings. One gilt
bronze pair includes birds and monkeys and dragons inlaid with
malachite and other stones.
</P>
<P>
   Another pair, lavishly inlaid with gold and silver, were made to
hold a crossbow on a chariot. Nicholas Grindley, another London
dealer is showing classical Chinese furniture at the Kate Ganz
Gallery, 25 E. 73rd St., Manhattan, from Wednesday to March 30. He
is selling a pair of spindle-back huanghuali chairs from the Kangsi
period (1662-1722) that are as modern in design as anything on
today's market.
</P>
<P>
   The Asian art auctions at Christie's and Sotheby's take place
all next week. The Asian decorative arts sale at Christie' East
opens on Monday. Sotheby's first sale, of Netsuke from the
collection of Raymond and Frances Bushell, is on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Sotheby's sale of Indian and Southeast Asian art on Thursday is
particularly strong. Lot 46 is a Nepalese bronze group from the
13th century. It represents the Hindu god Shiva and his consort
Parvati, who is languidly leaning on him. The crowned Shiva has his
foot on back of a lion; Parvati holds a lotus flower. ``This is a
museum-quality bronze,'' said Carlton C. Rochell Jr., the
specialist in charge of the sale. ``There is almost an ethereal
quality to these heavenly beings, who are supposed to be divinely
beautiful.'' The estimate is $150,000 to $250,000.
</P>
<P>
   Lot 118, a monumental Gandharan gray schist torso of Buddha from
the third or fourth century A.D., is literally larger than life.
The figure clearly shows the influence of Hellenistic sculpture. It
is wearing a pleated robe draped across his body. The estimate is
$60,000 to $90,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Southeast Asian sculpture is very undervalued,'' Rochell said.
If the piece were from Greece, it would go for 10 times more. &QL;

 Includes black-and-white photos and color slides of Academy Awards
host Billy Crystal. 
 By IVOR DAVIS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    For the more than 3,000 members of the media covering the 72nd
annual Academy Awards on March 26, it isn't until the televised
show ends that the real work will begin.
 &HT;    The chronically long-running ceremonies will probably wind down
around 10 p.m. _ 1 a.m. on the East Coast _ and winners and losers
alike will pour out of Los Angeles' Shrine Auditorium and into the
Academy's invitations-only Governors Ball.
 &HT;    But then, after only fleeting appearances at the official
post-awards party, the rich, the famous and the
famous-for-the-moment will hustle off to the places where the real
action is _ the post-post-Oscar parties, where seeing and being
seen with the in crowd is, as they say in the local parlance, where
it's at.
 &HT;    And for valiant journalists who, like your reporter, have
covered Oscar for more than 20 years, that means trying to be in
six places at once.
 &HT;    In the good old days, the only party that counted was the
Governors Ball, which this year has moved from under canvas on a
parking lot to the Shrine's Exposition Hall, only steps away from
the Oscar venue.
 &HT;    Some 1,650 guests are expected to show up at this year's ball,
where they'll feast on offerings from superstar chef Wolfgang Puck
that include marinated lobster salad, roasted potatoes with caviar,
smoked salmon, roasted chicken breast and black truffles, washed
down with assorted wines and rounded off by Puck's gold-dusted
chocolate Oscar, only one of five desserts available.
 &HT;    But despite the preparations, the food and thousands of dollars
in decorations, the truth is that many of the big names wouldn't be
caught dead spending the entire evening at the Governors Ball. As
quickly as they can get their limos out of the parking lot, they'll
be off to the more prestigious party of their choice.
 &HT;    This year's two hottest parties are the exclusive bashes tossed
by Dreamworks, which hopes for a festive night built on ``American
Beauty'' and its eight nominations, and Miramax, which pits ``Cider
House Rules'' against ``American Beauty'' for the Best Picture
statuette, only one of the film's seven nominations.
 &HT;    The Dreamworks shindig will be at Spago's restaurant, while the
Weinsteins of Miramax will hold court at the Beverly Hills Hotel.
The success of these events will, of course, depend on the success
of their movies.
 &HT;    And, no, observers should not read anything into the fact that,
while Miramax's owner Walt Disney also has seven nominations for
``The Insider,'' the parent studio is not planning a private
celebratory affair on Oscar night.
 &HT;    This whole business of dueling parties began back in the 1980s,
when agent Irving ``Swifty'' Lazar took over Spago's and invited
his celebrity pals to a black-tie dinner sans traffic jams. Golden
statuettes lined the bar as guests hobnobbed with the winners, and
Swifty's became the place to be on Oscar night.
 &HT;    When Lazar died in 1993, so did his party. But others quickly
stepped into the breach, and the parties proliferated.
 &HT;    Not that everybody goes. Director Chuck Workman is a veteran of
the Hollywood party circuit, and won a 1987 Best Documentary Oscar
for ``Precious Images,'' but he won't be making the party rounds
after this year's ceremony.
 &HT;    His new film, ``A House on a Hill,'' opens later this year, but
Workman may be best know for his brilliant assemblages of movie
clips that highlight the Oscar show every year. Last year, for
example, he had top stars picking their favorite movie moments.
This year he'll salute Warren Beatty, recipient of this year's
Irving Thalberg Award, with a movie retrospective.
 &HT;    ``Most of the people who work on the Oscar telecast have
finished a 16-hour day and are Oscared out,'' Workman says. ``So
it's the Governors Ball and then home for me. But many of the
younger stars like to make the scene, and they have the stamina to
show up at two or three post-Oscar parties.''
 &HT;    And for those celebrities who have that energy _ and who don't
have a 5 a.m. makeup call on Monday _ this year offers more parties
than ever, once the final Oscar credits have rolled. There are at
least six post-awards bashes, with several providing fine cuisine,
drinks and giant television sets for those who didn't get invited
to the actual show.
 &HT;    In some cases John Q. Public can even buy tickets and rub elbows
with show-business royalty, although the tariff is pretty steep _
as much as $1,500 per person.
 &HT;    That top ticket applies at a West Hollywood restaurant where, in
collaboration with In Style magazine, Elton John will host his
eighth Oscar-night party as a benefit for his AIDS Foundation. Last
year's party raised a beefy $360,000 for the cause.
 &HT;    Guests can stick around after dinner for dancing and
entertainment, and hope to bump into Oscar nominees such as Toni
Collette, Jude Law, Kevin Spacey, Michael Clarke Duncan, Chloe
Sevigny, Hilary Swank and Annette Bening _ assuming that her fourth
baby hasn't chosen that night to enter the world.
 &HT;    Sharon Stone, Charlize Theron, Oscar host Billy Crystal and
Elizabeth Hurley are also due to put in appearances at the party,
which will offer guests chances to win a Lexus or luxury watches.
Those who can't be there can go online for live coverage at
EltonJohn.com, and even bid on some of the singer's personal
belongings being auctioned to benefit the charity.
 &HT;    If you've got a spare $1,500 and want to make the scene, call
(310) 276-5802.
 &HT;    Meanwhile, across town at the Beverly Hills Hotel, music agent
Norby Walters offers a less expensive affair _ priced at a mere
$750. His ninth annual Night of 100 Stars gala benefits Martin
Scorsese's Film Preservation Foundation.
 &HT;    Once the ceremonies end, Walters promises, a host of celebrities
will make their way thither, including Rip Torn, Cliff Robertson,
Rod Steiger, Tony Curtis and Lynn Redgrave. If you'd like to
mingle, call (310) 289-8660.
 &HT;    For the less well-heeled, there's a shindig sponsored by
Hollywood's Entertainment Museum at 7021 Hollywood Blvd. Called a
``Salute to the Academy Awards with a Taste of Hollywood,'' it will
benefit a counseling center for troubled youth.
 &HT;    The fun of this one is that guests can book a table for four on
the ``Cheers'' set or, for $1,500 for a table of eight, in the Star
Trek Alien Warship Room. The museum hopes to attract some 600
guests, including some celebrities, though as of yet they aren't
dropping any names.
 &HT;    Then there's the Hollywood Stock Exchange's second annual
Academy Awards party at the House of Blues on Sunset Boulevard. To
start with, they'll be cordoning off an entire block on Sunset,
before the party moves into the House of Blues later on, with
entertainment provided by Earth Wind and Fire.
 &HT;    At least 2,000 people are expected to gather, including
celebrities galore. Last year, Nicolas Cage, Patricia Arquette,
Gov. Jesse Ventura, Dan Aykroyd, Donna Dixon, Courteney Cox
Arquette and Drew Barrymore showed up.
 &HT;    ``Stars have obligations to go to their respective studio
parties _ and then they come to our one,'' says spokeswoman
Jennifer Meillios.
 &HT;    It's not open to the public, except via online participation at
www.hsx/O2k.com.
 &HT;    And finally, if you know a member of the Writer's Guild, perhaps
you can wangle an invitation to the guild's first-ever Oscar dinner
in Beverly Hills.
 &HT;    ``It's an eclectic evening from tuxes to jeans,'' a Guild
spokesperson notes, ``where you can cheer with your peers.''
 &HT;    Except, of course, for those who've been nominated. They'll be
spending the early evening somewhere else entirely.

`BABYMOTHER': MOMMY THE DRUDGE BY DAY, DANCEHALL DIVA BY NIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes are at end of review) 
(af) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Babymother,'' like most pop movie musicals that know where
their bread is buttered, gets serious only long enough to sketch in
a story before it loses its head and surrenders giddily to song,
dance and merriment. Since its idiom is the percolating postreggae
style known as Jamaican dancehall, the movie's good mood isn't
simply upbeat, it's voluptuously ecstatic.
</P>
<P>
   When the spunky heroine, Anita (Anjela Lauren Smith), a
free-spirited dancehall diva, and her sassy two-member ``rude
girl'' crew (Caroline Chikezie and Jocelyn Esien) show off musical
chops in songs that are a cotton-candy-textured hybrid of rap,
reggae and pop, they are queens in a dress-up world of
phantasmagoric nightclub royalty.
</P>
<P>
   The witty, flamboyantly gaudy costumes, jewelry and makeup worn
by the male as well as female performers turn them into pagan
deities, strutting human birds of paradise spreading their wings
while undulating to the music's intensely erotic pulse.
</P>
<P>
   Money appears to be no obstacle in the creation of these
fantastic get-ups. The only limit to the costumed extravagance
seems to be imagination.
</P>
<P>
   The movie, set in the Harlesden section of London, paints that
largely Jamaican neighborhood as a funkier West Indian-flavored
descendant of the title city in Jacques Demy's ``Young Girls of
Rochefort.''
</P>
<P>
   The housing may be drab, but the streets explode with a
pageantry that makes every day a kind of impromptu Mardi Gras
festival. The happily-ever-after romantic ditziness in Demy's movie
musicals, however, is very different from the here-and-now
sensuality of ``Babymother,'' where an easygoing sexual energy
pours out of every frame.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's Anita is a beautiful, haughty ``babymother'' raising two
young children, Anton (Anton Rice) and Saffron (Saffron Lashley),
in an apartment she shares with her educated, strait-laced older
sister Rose (Suzette Llewellyn) and their scolding mother, Edith
(Corinne Skinner Carter). Byron (Wil Johnson), the dashing young
singer who sired Anita's children, shows up from time to time, but
he and Anita usually end up fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Although Byron loves Anita and their children, he has been too
busy pursuing his career (and other women) to spend much time with
them. Impulsively he decides to be a live-in father, but his dream
of a conventional close-knit family is shattered by Anita's refusal
to give up her dream of pop success. (She even goes so far as to
trade sexual favors for studio time.)
</P>
<P>
   The film's climactic scene is a musical battle of the sexes
waged when Anita and her crew crash a nightclub talent show and
compete head to head with Byron.
</P>
<P>
   Had ``Babymother'' evoked even a semblance of social realism, it
might have amounted to something more than a candy-colored,
beat-driven show-business fantasy. But the movie, written and
directed by Julian Henriques, would much rather wallow in music
than develop the strands of a story in which Anita defies her
mother, weathers a family tragedy, adjusts to an astounding
revelation about her parentage and deals with shady music-business
types and jealous rivals.
</P>
<P>
   While the real world occasionally intrudes on ``Babymother,'' it
never stays long enough to dampen the movie's infectious party
spirits. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `Babymother' is rated R (under 17 requires accompanying parent
or adult guardian). It has sexual situations. &QL;

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Much colder weather will return to the Northeast as brisk winds
from the northeast follow low pressure racing off the coast. Rain
will end as wet snow in much of New England. Only a small
accumulation is expected near the shore, but several inches should
fall inland. Even in southwest New England, rain may end as snow
showers. Skies will clear rapidly over western and northern
sections during the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Polar air will surge southward into the Middle Atlantic region
and through the Ohio Valley. The clockwise circulation around high
pressure in Ontario will keep clouds and flurries over parts of the
central Appalachians. The leading edge of chilly air will stretch
from North Carolina to the central Gulf states. Showers will
accompany the front along the Southeast coast. Florida will stay
sultry with fewer thundershowers.
</P>
<P>
   A small, but potent disturbance moving east across Texas will
produce rain and thunderstorms in eastern sections, and the wet
weather will spread into Louisiana, Oklahoma and southern Arkansas.
It will be dull and cool in the remainder of the southern Plains.
Milder air with increasing clouds will dominate the western Plains
as a cold front sweeps east from the Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   Gusty winds and patches of snow showers are expected in Wyoming
and Colorado as cooler, moist air pushes in from the Pacific. A
ridge of high pressure building into Oregon will draw warmer, dry
air from the deserts into California. The Northwest coast will
become damp as rain returns ahead of a warm front.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Patchwork Snowstorm
</P>
<P>
   When wintry weather comes to Colorado, a few miles makes a
staggering difference in the depth of new fallen snow. Thursday
morning, over 2 feet of snow had accumulated near Estes Park, while
10 miles away in Boulder, the blanket of white was just 8 inches
deep. Colorado storms are shaped by the cooling of moist air that
ascends the steep slopes. The temperature of moist air falls 3
degrees for each 1,000 feet it rises. As the air cools, more water
vapor condenses into flakes, resulting in a patchwork of snow
depths that responds to the undulating terrain.

`ERIN BROCKOVICH': HIGH IDEALS, HIGHER HEELS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Editors: Publication notes appear at end of review.) 
(DW) 
 By A.O. SCOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ We first encounter Erin Brockovich (Julia Roberts), a
twice-divorced mother of three with emphatic taste in clothes, in
the midst of a run of bad luck. After bluffing her way through a
disastrous job interview, she is involved in a car accident.
Although she accessorizes her short skirts and tight tops with a
fetching neck brace, her lawsuit against the other driver, a
wealthy doctor, fails. One baby-sitter quits, her replacement has
the demeanor of a medicated psychopath, and a motorcycle gang has
moved in next door. Erin's bank balance stands at $74, and her baby
is running a fever.
</P>
<P>
   For its first half-hour or so, as the movie tracks its heroine's
growing desperation, ``Erin Brockovich'' is a minor tour de force.
Roberts, a quick-witted, inventive actress when she's in the mood,
shows us her character's abrasiveness as well as her vulnerability,
her simmering anger, her sexiness and charm. Erin's life is like a
panicky sprint in high-heeled shoes; at any moment she may collapse
into a heap of ridiculousness or break her neck.
</P>
<P>
   It is also in the early part of ``Erin Brockovich,'' before it
becomes a standard-issue do-gooder melodrama, that the director's
hand is most in evidence. The director in question is Stephen
Soderbergh, who has, in the years since ``Sex, Lies and
Videotape,'' matured into a cinematic stylist of striking erudition
and originality. This time out he restrains some of his bolder
impulses: there are none of the sudden flashbacks that kept ``Out
of Sight'' so brilliantly off balance, and certainly no brazen jump
cuts, as in ``The Limey'' last year.
</P>
<P>
   But Soderbergh's signature is nonetheless visible in the slow,
offbeat pacing of his scenes and in his sharp sense of visual
detail. His camera is like a wry, unobtrusive observer, waiting to
be surprised by what it sees. By seeming simply to watch the world
move in its own jerky rhythm, he comes upon moments of jolting
intensity. You not only witness the humiliations casually and
routinely visited on working-class women; you feel in the pit of
your stomach the overwhelming anxiety of impoverished single
motherhood, which often amounts to a state of sheer terror.
</P>
<P>
   But then, once ``Erin Brockovich'' stumbles upon its plot,
everything changes. Erin's luck takes a happier turn: she lands a
low-paying, no-benefits job working for Ed Masry (Albert Finney),
the gruff ambulance chaser who represented her in her own failed
lawsuit; her neighbor the biker (Aaron Eckhart) turns out to be a
sensitive he-man who's happy to provide free baby-sitting in
anticipation of his inevitable promotion to love interest; and soon
enough the plucky Erin has embarked on a long legal battle to help
the residents of a Southern California town whose health has been
ruined by toxic chemicals from a power plant.
</P>
<P>
   As Erin Brockovich becomes a crusader for justice, ``Erin
Brockovich'' becomes a doggedly conventional crusader-for-justice
Hollywood soap opera, a smooth second-hand amalgam of ``Norma Rae''
and ``Silkwood,'' with vigorous nods to ``The Rainmaker'' and ``A
Civil Action.''
</P>
<P>
   Who could have foreseen that this most unpredictable of
filmmakers could have made a movie so utterly predictable? Not only
is every plot development signaled far in advance, but nearly every
scene in the film's long second section rings a variation of one of
two themes: 1) Julia Roberts tells somebody off, or 2) Julia
Roberts feels somebody's pain.
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, I meant to say Erin Brockovich. But that's just the
problem. After proving, for about 40 minutes, what a marvelous
actress she can be, Roberts spends the next 90 content to be a
movie star. As the movie drags on, her performance swells to
bursting with moral vanity and phony populism.
</P>
<P>
   It's as though her contract stipulated that nobody else was
allowed to be attractive or appealing on screen. Finney, puffing
and growling, is convincingly attired in garish shirts and a curly
toupee that will forever expunge memories of the raffish seducer in
``Tom Jones.'' Eckhart is nice enough, but too hairy to compete
with Roberts in the charisma department.
</P>
<P>
   The noncompetition clause seems to have been applied with
special rigor to the female characters. Erin's co-workers at the
law firm are frumpy, badly dressed and just plain mean. Her
nemesis, a lawyer (Veanne Cox) who is actually on the same side of
the case, is an uptight snob with no feeling for the ordinary
hard-working folks she must represent. In contrast Erin is a life
force, brimming with wholesome sexuality and unpretentious common
sense.
</P>
<P>
   As Erin helps the victims of corporate negligence find redress,
she herself finds confidence and a sense of purpose. Her zeal for
her job causes inevitable conflicts with her lover and her
children, but these are dramatic red herrings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want the fairy tale'' was the tag line of the movie that
made Julia Roberts a star, and a fairy tale is what ``Erin
Brockovich'' becomes. It retails the fantasy that selflessness and
self-interest are perfectly congruent. For all its plain-folks
sentiment, the movie's moral compass is calibrated in dollars:
hundreds of millions of them. That's what the victims of corporate
negligence demand, and that's what this movie is likely to earn at
the box office. It will most likely also earn Roberts an Oscar
nomination and make Soderbergh among the most sought-after
directors in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   When a film so ardently embraces every cliche that crosses its
path, how can a hapless reviewer do otherwise? ``Erin Brockovich''
will make you laugh. It will make you cry. It will make you stand
up and cheer. ``Erin Brockovich'' is the feel-good movie of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Erin Brockovich'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying
parent or adult guardian). It contains a scattering of obscenities
and sexual references and displays of female cleavage in the
service of a noble cause.

 &HT;    SCREENERS CALLED THE WEAKEST LINK IN AIRPORT SECURITY SYSTEM
 &HT;    By ISMAIL TURAY Jr.
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ High turnover among people who screen passengers
and luggage is the weakest link in the nation's airport security
system, aviation officials told Congress on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The technology exists to detect contraband and weapons, but
operators must be carefully selected, monitored and trained, said
Alexis M. Stefani, an assistant inspector general at the U.S.
Department of Transportation.
</P>
<P>
   However, the people who operate metal detectors and X-ray
equipment at airports sometimes are replaced four times a year,
according to a study by the General Accounting Office.
</P>
<P>
   ``With regards to retention, I think it's obvious that we have
to keep people on the job longer,'' Cathal(cq) Flynn, the Federal
Aviation Administration's top official for civil aviation security,
told the House aviation subcommittee. ``At 400 percent turnover
rate, I think it's difficult to train people to sharpen pencils.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the demanding nature of the job, Flynn said, the private
companies that provide security services for most airlines pay many
employees minimum wage. Sometimes the screeners leave to work at
airport fast-food outlets for higher pay and benefits, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA is working on new rules that would require security
companies to be certified, Flynn said. It expects to make a final
decision on whether to implement the rule, which was suggested in
1996 by the White House Commission on Aviation Safety Security, by
May 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The administration will also use a new technology known as
Threat Image Projection (TIP) to measure the performance of
individual screeners and screening companies.
</P>
<P>
   TIP is a computer program that electronically inserts images of
contraband on X-ray and explosives detection system monitors,
making it appear that the material is inside a bag being screened.
</P>
<P>
   A computer-based training system to evaluate and train screeners
is also under study, Stefani said.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA hopes to install these devices and other equipment at
airports nationwide by 2003, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even with better training and better pay, some members of the
aviation subcommittee said they feared screeners with criminal
backgrounds will be hired to handle passengers' luggage.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA now performs criminal background checks on screeners,
but it doesn't disqualify candidates who have been arrested for
such crimes as burglary, drug possession, arm robberies and assault
with a deadly weapon, Stefani said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just extraordinary to me that we let the system operate
in this way,'' said Rep. Peter A. DeFazio, D-Ore. ``Why have a weak
link in a sophisticated security system?''

 &HT;    News and notes from NASCAR
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell &AMP; Rick Minter
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Making headlines
</P>
<P>
   LOOKING BACK
</P>
<P>
   Fans, NASCAR thrilled with Atlanta race: Bruton Smith, chairman
of Speedway Motorsports, Inc. (which owns Atlanta Motor Speedway)
said he has been told by many people that last weekend's Cracker
Barrel 500 was the ``greatest race'' they had ever seen. It's hard
to argue. With Dale Earnhardt nipping Bobby Labonte by .010 seconds
-- less than two feet, this likely will be remembered as the most
memorable spring race. It required a finish-line photo to determine
the winner.
</P>
<P>
   Labonte shows champion's attitude: Labonte had numerous chances
during the final 12 laps to bump Earnhardt into the wall, as The
Intimidator did to Terry Labonte at Bristol last year; but the
little brother didn't. He saved his tires and nearly pulled off a
pass on the final lap. The most touching scene of the weekend
happened after Labonte spoke to ABC-TV immediately after the race:
He broke down and cried in the arms of a team member.
</P>
<P>
   LOOKING AHEAD
</P>
<P>
   Enough already: There should be no more comments from Dale
Jarrett, the defending Winston Cup champion. With the thrilling
finish at the Cracker Barrel 500, Jarrett can quit being NASCAR's
public relations expert on the subject of ``boring racing'' and
focus again on his efforts at repeating as champion. Jarrett spent
last weekend chewing out reporters for calling the first three
boring races, ``boring,'' and it appeared to distract the Ford No.
88 team's preparation for the race.
</P>
<P>
   Time to make changes in the pits: Actions speak louder than
words: Pit road is an accident waiting to happen, as evidenced by
several more injuries to crew member in Atlanta. NASCAR is
``looking into'' the situation, but does somebody have to die
before changes are made?
</P>
<P>
   Elliott having a great run: The worst-kept secret in Winston Cup
was revealed last weekend when Bill Elliott joined Dodge for the
2001 season. But the spotlight stays on the No. 94 team; Elliott
stands fourth in the Winston Cup points standings.
</P>
<P>
   Hear that sigh of relief? There are changes in provisionals
</P>
<P>
   Darlington Raceway is not the favorite track for many Winston
Cup drivers because of its tough surface and narrow lanes. But it
will be a darling place this weekend for veterans Johnny Benson and
Ken Schrader and rookies Dale Earnhardt Jr. and Matt Kenseth.
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR's provisional process changes this weekend. The TranSouth
400 is the fifth race of the Winston Cup season, which means
provisionals will be judged on owner's points compiled during the
2000 season.
</P>
<P>
   For the previous four races, the provisionals were based on the
final standings of owner's points from the 1999 season. So pressure
was on the rookies and many veterans with new race teams. These
teams had to make races on first-round qualifying times.
</P>
<P>
   With owner's points now stacked up after the first four races,
Benson, Schrader and Earnhardt Jr. can be more aggressive during
qualifying.
</P>
<P>
   They have provisionals in the bank.
</P>
<P>
   STORY OF THE WEEK
</P>
<P>
   The return of excitement: Sunday's Cracker Barrel 500 at Atlanta
Motor Speedway was one of the most thrilling races of the young
NASCAR season with Dale Earnhardt and his No. 3 Goodwrench
Chevrolet holding off a determined effort by Bobby Labonte and his
No. 18 Pontiac for the win. It required a finish-line photo to
determine the winner.
</P>
<P>
   LEADERS OF THE PACK
</P>
<P>
   A quick look at some of the sport's top owners
</P>
<P>
   1. Robert Yates. He has resurrected the career of Ricky Rudd and
in February won his third Daytona 500 title as a car owner _ 1992
with Davey Allison, 1996 and 2000 with Dale Jarrett. He pulled off
a major coup by hiring the Rainbow Warriors from the No. 24 team
last year and he has two drivers who are contenders for the Winston
Cup title.
</P>
<P>
   2. Joe Gibbs. The ``coach'' has learned that, to be successful
in racing, you need to have good people in place in your
organization and allow them to do their job. Crew chiefs Jimmy
Makar and Greg Zipadelli fit perfectly into Gibbs' philosophy. His
drivers _ Bobby Labonte and Tony Stewart _ are positioned to win
and challenge for the title. Gibbs also spends time with his sons,
J.D. and Coy, who have racing aspirations.
</P>
<P>
   3. Richard Childress. He might be the most powerful owner on the
circuit. Childress started complaining about the ``disadvantaged''
Chevrolets at Daytona and did not let up until NASCAR announced
modifications last week. During the last five years, Childress had
taken a backseat to Hendrick Motorsports as the top Chevy team on
the circuit, but not in 2000. Childress' most difficult job this
year could be keeping the peace between his two drivers _ Dale
Earnhardt and Mike Skinner.
</P>
<P>
   4. Jack Roush. You have to give credit to the long-time Ford
owner, who demonstrates a workmanlike attitude every week. The
addition of Jeff Burton four years ago was a good move by Roush;
the No. 99 team has become one of Winston Cup's elite teams. He
also has brought talented rookie Matt Kenseth into the fold. Chad
Little continues to struggle, despite a good run in Atlanta last
week. The success of Mark Martin and Burton makes Roush an easy
pick.
</P>
<P>
   5. Felix Sabates. Some people might question this selection, but
the criteria cover more than just winning races. Sabates is the
ultimate owner in terms of staying out of the way of his teams and
providing unlimited funds. Sabates also makes the list for his
colorful personality, sadly missing in most of the garage area.
</P>
<P>
   ON THE RISE
</P>
<P>
   Some strong performances from those who are making a move toward
the front of the pack.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Car owner Tim Beverly. The Tyler Jet Motorsports team has been
the Cinderella story of 2000. Beverly deserves credit for giving
veteran driver Johnny Benson a chance to redeem himself after
Benson spent more than six figures to buy his way out of the
remainder of his contract with Jack Roush.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Dale Earnhardt. The Intimidator has built the ``Garage Mahal''
to house his two entries in Winston Cup. Dale Earnhardt Jr. and
Steve Park are two of the sport's future stars. With deep pockets
and talented personnel in place, DEI probably will be one of the
top five racing teams in Winston Cup by 2001.
</P>
<P>
   FREE-FALLIN'
</P>
<P>
   Some weak performances from those who appear headed toward the
back of the pack.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Brett Bodine. He is one of the last remaining single team
owner-drivers and it is taking its toll. Bodine has failed to
qualify for two of the first four races and already is behind in
the provisional game for coveted starting spots.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  A.J. Foyt. The Conseco team was struggling with driver Mike
Bliss, so Foyt replaced him Wednesday with Dick Trickle.
``SuperTex'' always has been a fierce competitor and decided to
withdraw as a team owner in the Indy Racing League at the end of
1999 to focus on a Winston Cup team. He gambled by hiring the
rookie Bliss. The team also has been hurt by not having
provisionals. After missing the race in Atlanta, Foyt vowed he
would make changes on the No. 14 team. ``It was a necessary step to
make,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR QandA with KEN SCHRADER
</P>
<P>
   Veteran driver Ken Schrader, 44, is driving a new car this
season _ the No. 36 Pontiac owned by Tom Beard, Nelson Bowers and
Read Morton. Although he finished 23rd in the Cracker Barrel 500 at
Atlanta, Schrader is 10th in Winston Cup points. Here he talks with
Cox News Service's Rick Minter, who filed this report.
</P>
<P>
   Q:How is your relationship with your new owners?
</P>
<P>
   A:I almost went to work for them four years ago when they
started this deal. I didn't know them, but Rick Hendrick (whom
Schrader once drove for) spoke very highly of them, and that was
all I needed to know. I've really enjoyed it so far. We have
different seats on Sunday, but I hear they have a lot of fun on
race days.
</P>
<P>
   Q:Are you pleased with how your season has gone?
</P>
<P>
   A:Overall I am, other than our qualifying. We've struggled
there, which I didn't really anticipate. But we had a decent run at
Daytona (9th), ran 13th at Rockingham and a 16th at Vegas, but we
would have been a lot better without the rain. We're off to a
fairly solid start.
</P>
<P>
   Q:What are your thoughts on the debate over the aerodynamics of
the three makes of cars?
</P>
<P>
   A:When you sit down in that car you just see the dashboard and
you can't tell what make it is. NASCAR has got a pretty good way of
handling that and they keep it pretty competitive. Everybody can
say what they want but at the end of the race there are always
Fords, Pontiacs and Chevys up there.
</P>
<P>
   Q:Would it help the show if the cars were slowed some?
</P>
<P>
   A:Any time cars go faster, the track becomes more one-groove.
We've got better bodies and better engines, but most of our speed
gains in the last couple of years have come from Goodyear. Goodyear
can build us a little slower tire.
</P>
<P>
   Q:Is age a big factor for race drivers?
</P>
<P>
   A:Not as long as you stay in shape and want to do it. Bobby
Allison was having one of his best years when he was 50 and then
got hurt. Harry Gant won four races at 51 and Dale Earnhardt, we
don't know for sure how old he is, but he still looks pretty stout.
</P>
<P>
   Q:How many short track races do you plan to run in addition to
the Winston Cup schedule?
</P>
<P>
   A:Probably about 40 _ mostly one-night deals with the dirt car.
I go to the Midwest to run the dirt car. I like that kind of dirt
because you can run sideways. I don't like clay (which is on most
dirt tracks in the Southeast). Clay's like running asphalt and I do
that every weekend.
</P>
<P>
   IT TAKES TWO
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen of the 20 top-5 finishes in 2000 _ 90 percent _ have
been by multi-car teams. Here's how they stack up:
</P>
<P>
   5 _ Roush Racing
</P>
<P>
   5 _ Joe Gibbs Racing
</P>
<P>
   2 _ Richard Childress Racing
</P>
<P>
   2 _ Robert Yates Racing
</P>
<P>
   1 _ Penske Racing
</P>
<P>
   1 _ Dale Earnhardt Inc.
</P>
<P>
   1 _ Bill Davis Racing
</P>
<P>
   1 _ Andy Petree Racing
</P>
<P>
   0 _ Hendrick Motorsports
</P>
<P>
   0 _ Petty Enterprises
</P>
<P>
   0 _ Team Sabco
</P>
<P>
   0 _ Travis Carter Enterprises

 &HT;    Injuries in the pits prompt review of NASCAR rules
 &HT;    By Rick Minter
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The excitement and danger inherent in Winston Cup racing doesn't
end when it comes time for pit stops, 20-second races within the
race that often determine winners and losers.
</P>
<P>
   During pit stops, 301 pit-crew members _ seven per team _ will
run onto pit road at some point and service their cars. All the
while, drivers are trying to work their way through the maze of
mechanics to get to their pit stalls and back onto the track.
</P>
<P>
   Therein lies the problem. In the young 2000 racing season, there
already have been several serious accidents in the pits, including
cars hitting drivers and fires created by spilled gasoline. That's
why drivers and crew members agree that working on pit road is the
most hazardous job in racing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Driving feels safer because you're strapped in a steel roll
cage,'' said Andy Thurman, who changes tires for Bill Elliott. ``On
pit road, you feel like you're just out there in the open.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Thurman takes the chance because being on a crew gets him
into the Winston Cup garage. There, he hopes to meet people who can
help him graduate from working with wheels to steering them.
</P>
<P>
   And, then there's the competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pretty incredible rush trying to knock down a real good
pit stop and beat the 42 other teams out there,'' Thurman said.
</P>
<P>
   Through the years, NASCAR has taken steps to keep crew members
safe. A review of pit road safety is under way in the wake of
mishaps involving crew member in three of the four races this
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're on a mission to look at a lot of details, one of which
is pit road,'' said Mike Helton, NASCAR's chief operating officer.
``That's part of the sport, but we want it to be a safe part of the
sport.''
</P>
<P>
   For years, drivers raced on pit road just as they did on the
track. But that changed in 1990, after Mike Rich, a crew member for
Elliott, was struck and killed in a race at Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Now, pit road speeds are limited to 35 to 55 mph, depending on the
size of the track and the arrangement of the pits.
</P>
<P>
   But the potential for injury remains. ``You still have 43 cars
that have 700 horsepower and weigh 3,400 pounds each and a whole
bunch of them coming down pit road at the same time,'' rookie
driver Matt Kenseth said. ``It's amazing more accidents don't
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenseth said drivers have to be patient and not take chances
with other people's lives, particularly during the heat of battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``If somebody has you blocked in the pits, it's hard not to just
stand on the gas, spin the back end around and try to get out of
there,'' Kenseth said. ``You just have to be smart and not run
anybody over.''
</P>
<P>
   Driver Kenny Wallace isn't bashful about what he thinks needs to
be done. He said teams should be ordered to pick up tires once they
are taken off the cars. During the Daytona 500, Mike Lingerfelt, a
crew member on Tony Stewart's car, was trying to move a wayward
tire out of Stewart's path and was struck by Stewart. The impact
broke Lingerfelt's leg.
</P>
<P>
   ``All NASCAR has to do is say, `Gentlemen, pick up your tires,
and if you don't there's a penalty,''' Wallace said. ``Why they
don't mandate that is beyond me.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace and several other drivers said making pit stalls bigger
would give crews more room to work. But he said he doesn't expect
that to happen soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I know the racing community like I know it, the first thing
they'll think about is how much money it will cost, and they'd
rather have people run over than put in bigger boxes,'' Wallace
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Clark, president of Atlanta Motor Speedway, said Wallace,
``doesn't have any idea what he's even talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We do everything NASCAR tells us to do, and we go beyond that
and make suggestions on how to do things better,'' Clark said.
``We've spent $93.5 million on capital improvements at this track
and a few more dollars to make the pits safer wouldn't be a
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Other drivers said NASCAR is doing its best to keep crew members
safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think NASCAR has done a great job, and they'll continue to
work in that area,'' Elliott said. Of modern era drivers, Elliott's
crew has suffered the most injuries on pit road.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have few regrets about my career, but the things that
happened on pit road have been the hardest thing I've ever had to
deal with,'' Elliott said.
</P>
<P>
   Helton said the sanctioning body constantly evaluates video of
races and tries to improve conditions for all racing participants.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to anticipate as much as we can in our procedures and
policies, but we can't anticipate every freak happening that can
happen in that environment,'' Helton said. ``Every time something
happens, we go to work and see how we can do it better. We just
haven't found a better policy or procedure that keeps everything
else intact.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Nelson, who manages the Winston Cup division, said the
encouraging result is the response by race teams to the early
season pit road incidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``The competitors went to work on their pit crew practices,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   INJURIES ON PIT ROAD
</P>
<P>
   Here are some serious mishaps on NASCAR's pit road:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  1960 _ Two crew members, Paul McDuffie and Charles Sweatmund
of Atlanta, and NASCAR official Joe Taylor of Paterson, N.J., are
killed when Bobby Johns' car spins out of control at Darlington.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  1975 _ Randy Owens, Richard Petty's brother-in-law, dies when
an air tank explodes at Talladega.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  1979 _ Dennis Wade, a jack man for Dave Watson, is struck and
killed by Watson at Atlanta Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  1987 _ Four of Bill Elliott's crew members are injured when
Michael Waltrip's car is struck by another car and knocked into
Elliott's pit area.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  1990 _ Michael Rich, a crew member for Bill Elliott, dies
after being struck when Ricky Rudd's car slid out of control.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  2000 _ During the Bud Shootout at Daytona, Mark Martin strikes
his jack man, Mike Ehret, causing minor bruises. A distraught
Martin drops out of the race; During the Daytona 500, Mike
Lingerfelt, a crew member for Tony Stewart, suffers a broken leg
when he tries to move a tire out of Stewart's way and is struck by
Stewart. At Rockingham, Joe Karasinski, gas man for Wally
Dallenbach, is burned by a fire in the pits; At Atlanta, a jack man
for Ken Schrader was struck by Kyle Petty's Pontiac and a fire
erupted in Ted Musgrave's pit area when a spark ignited spilled
gas.

 &HT;    THE MAKING OF AN ATLANTA BOY BAND
 &HT;    Step 1: Find 6 CUTE guys!
 &HT;    By Miriam Longino and Richard Eldredge
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Last August, six teenage boys from rather ordinary
homes in Atlanta's ring of suburbs sat down at a conference table
in Alpharetta, Ga., and opened up a white three-ring binder that
contained a 60-page business plan. It spelled out how they were
going to become rich and famous in two years as the Next Great Boy
band in America. Pared down to its essence, says one, the idea was
to:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Learn to sing in harmony.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Learn to dance in synch.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Perform at places like Six Flags and the Mall of Georgia, and
make every little girl who happens to pause and watch you believe
she's special, and that you're singing to her. Just her. (It helps
to sign autographs and hand out roses.)
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Make an album, and shoot a video _ which is what brought the
group to the heart of Atlanta last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   It's March 11 and the members of 6Piece are standing in the
rain, emoting into the camera and lip-synching their way into the
American pop consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   The scene is somewhat surreal. The six young teenagers, dressed
in leather Avirex athletic jackets purchased at a local mall, stand
at bewildered attention while a makeup artist dabs their baby
faces.
</P>
<P>
   One is a little worried, and asks, ``Do I look like I have 10
pounds of lipstick on?''
</P>
<P>
   A boom box begins blasting a thump-beat love song that sounds
like a cross between All-4-0ne's ``I Swear'' and Cher's electronic
vocal noodling on her recent hit ``Believe'' _ ``My first, my last,
I'm gonna love you forever.'' On cue, the guys launch into a kind
of sexy dip/bounce that seems oddly out of place in front of the
old facade of the Roxy Theatre. Bizarrely, the whole thing is
nearly drowned out by the pounding horns of the Tucker High School
marching band high-stepping its way through the Dazz Band's ``Let
It Whip,'' part of a St. Patrick's Day Parade which,
coincidentally, is weaving its way through Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin, Alex, Brandon, Bobby, Micah and John aren't household
names yet _ but they're working on it. These six kids from
Alpharetta, Lilburn, Ga., Cumming, Ga., and Loganville, Ga., who
just a year ago were roaming the malls or pondering their scores on
the SAT, have become Atlanta's answer to the Backstreet Boys and 'N
Sync. Or at least their creator Maurice Starr _ who is also
manager/producer/songwriter _ hopes so.
</P>
<P>
   Starr, the 46-year-old Svengali who essentially invented the
formula of packaging squeaky clean white kids as hip-hop performers
in 1986, when he assembled New Kids on the Block, is back in the
game. After watching his own proteges turn acts such as Backstreet
Boys into multimillion-dollar hit machines, he emerged from his
Alpharetta recording studio (where he has been quietly producing
gospel acts for five years) and went looking for another set of
boys with potential to shape into stars.
</P>
<P>
   To the chagrin of anyone who believes the music comes first, his
strategy seems to have little to do with artistic creative
expression. Starr is a master chef with a recipe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like baking a cake,'' he says, watching his six young
students point and wink and move their hands like a maitre de
inviting someone to sit down to dinner. ``New Kids on the Block
were a cake. Everything starts from a vision, an embryo. Everybody
can fry chicken, but the man who started KFC had his own style.
This is my recipe for cooking up a boy band.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr began assembling his ingredients last spring when he
passed out flyers at area high schools to recruit teens who would
be willing to essentially turn their lives over to him for two
years. He personally screened about 200 calls, narrowing his search
by asking three questions: ``How tall are you? How much do you
weigh? And are you good looking?''
</P>
<P>
   Next, Starr held auditions at his home studio, where he watched
the teenagers mimic song lyrics and dance steps. Following the
boyband recipe _ which calls for a diversity of boy types _ he knew
what he needed. First on board was 19-year-old Kevin Swan, a
parttime model with ladykiller looks who Starr decided would be the
group's ``heartbreaker.''
</P>
<P>
   Kevin describes his style this way: ``I wear 10 rings.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At first my friends and my parents were real skeptical,'' the
teen says politely, his responses peppered with ``Yes ma'ams.''
``They never expected to hear us on the radio or see our CD in
stores. Now they are as mind-boggled and excited as I am _ `My
son's gonna be a superstar!' ''
</P>
<P>
   Then Starr found his wisecracking rebel (John), his good buddy
(Bobby), the baby-faced innocent (Micah), the swarthy crooner with
creative facial hair (Alex) and the all-important sixth member
(Brandon), who still seems to be searching for his role in the
group. But Brandon's presence was essential to Starr in order to
make 6 Piece different from the glut of boy bands saturating the
marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody else looks the same because they've got five guys,''
he says matter-of-factly. ``We're gonna look different on TV
because we've got six.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the group was assembled, Starr began holding rehersals
seven days a week, six hours a day. Contracts were signed, with the
boys retaining an entertainment lawyer to carve out their end of
the deal. According to Kevin, Starr gets 20 percent as manager. The
guys split 10 percent between the six of them. The rest goes to
Starr's independent label, Starrworks, and for promotion and
marketing.
</P>
<P>
   But there was another expectation, perhaps more important than
any conventional music business game plan. The guys of 6 Piece had
to develop a fan base _ before their music was ever on the radio.
</P>
<P>
   How? By aiming straight for the hearts of little girls.
</P>
<P>
   Like a pop version of Amway or Mary Kay Cosmetics, Starr's idea
enlists young girls to chat up 6 Piece to their friends. There are
hundreds of them here today, as VIP extras on the video shoot,
shivering in the damp rain. They are waiting to catch the eye of
their favorite 6 Piecer. Wearing tight short skirts, low-waisted
bell bottoms, black platform shoes and more halter tops than a
``Baywatch'' episode, they hang around the stairway leading to the
dressing area at the Celebrity Rock Cafe, swapping 6 Piece stories
like salesmen at a convention.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen-year-old Niki Sexton of Lawrenceville, Ga., and Rachel
Cook, 13, of Kennesaw, Ga., explain how it works.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're on the Promote Team,'' Cook says.
</P>
<P>
   The Promote Team?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah. Each guy picked 10 girls to be part of the Promote
Team,'' Sexton explains. ``They give us stuff to hand out. Like
when Bobby from the band gave me these black cards (forms to
pre-order the group's album) and told me to run down the mall, and
I went into stores and yelled `Come see these hot, fine guys!' ``
</P>
<P>
   Over the months, Starr has trotted out 6 Piece on small stages
all over the Atlanta area. As girls stop to watch, the young
performers use the careful training Starr has given them to work
the crowd. After the show, rather than ducking into a dressing room
or being whisked off in a limo, Kevin, Micah, Bobby, Brandon, John
and Alex hang around and talk with their fans. They exchange e-mail
addresses and collect names for a mailing list to notify the girls
where they will appear next. A slickly designed Web site
(www.6pieceonline.com) also contains direct e-mail links to each
boy in the group. Kevin says each time he sits down at his
computer, he has ``at least 100'' messages from this interactive
fan base.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think about it,'' Starr says over a bacon cheeseburger at
Johnny Rockets, on break from the video shoot. ``You do this all
across the country. You get 100,000 of them, and each buys 10
records, what's that? Platinum.''
</P>
<P>
   The entire scene here could be a documentary on the lure _ or
perhaps more accurately, the illusion _ of fame. Plop any one of
these guys down at Publix or the Gap, and it's unlikley anyone
would know who they are. But behind the velvet rope sealing them
off from fans, these young stars in the making seem special.
</P>
<P>
   Older teen girls pump their hips to loud rap lyrics _ ``move it
move it move it'' _ waiting for the members of 6 Piece to lean over
a balcony railing. Alex playfully takes off his shirt, setting off
high-pitched screams. The others wander down into the crowd and
invite girls to join them behind the velvet rope. Outside in the
rain, a girl in a black tube-top dashes for cover while trying to
protect the autographs _ she got all six! _ scrawled on her upper
body in magic marker. Everyone is caught up. Soon even casual
onlookers know Kevin from Micah from Bobby.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's exciting,'' Niki says. ``The lifestyle, the screams,
people knowing your name. Like when I went to the CD release party,
I had on this VIP pass and I felt like `Oh my gosh, I feel so
important!'''
</P>
<P>
   Nicki's mom, 41-year-old Debbie Sexton, believes it's all
innocent fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are nice people. We show up at everything,'' she says.
``Right now, the guys are having as much fun as the girls. ... I
can remember when the Beatles came, it was your dream to just say
`I met them'. This is like, `I was there. I know them.'''
</P>
<P>
   Starr's strategy comes with perks and bonuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``These girls can't control themselves because we make them feel
like VIPs,'' he says. ``We give them the game plan, fill them up
with energy and send them on their way. It's not unlike that
motivational speaker, what's his name ...Tony Robbins. The ones who
do the best (i.e. high record sales in their neighborhoods) get
limo rides, dinner with their favorite guy, a concert in their
living room.''
</P>
<P>
   In the months leading up to this video shoot, some of the fans
have even become friends with the guys, hanging out with them at
Steak &AMP; Shake, riding the water slides at Whitewater, attending
youth nights at Cowboy's. But the girls, their parents and Starr
insist the relationships stay strictly platonic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a date,'' Rachel says. ``It's like a hangout.''
</P>
<P>
   Paula Youngblood of Stone Mountain, whose daughter Kimberly, 20,
appears as a fan in the video, said she had her doubts when Starr
approached her daughter at a local teen club.
</P>
<P>
   ``I work at a law firm, and I checked him out, believe me,'' she
says. ``Anytime a 40-something year old man is looking at my
daughter, he's going to be checked out by me. I made him take me to
lunch at Picadilly, and we discussed things.''
</P>
<P>
   With Starr as songwriter on all 10 tracks, 6 Piece's first
album, ``Phase I,'' arrived in stores last week. The single, ``My
First, My Last,'' was picked up in Atlanta by new Top 40 station,
95.5 The Beat. The video is being rushed into post-production, then
will be distributed to music channels such as the Box, an
all-request cable channel that has become a tryout forum for new
acts before they make it to MTV. That's when the Promote Team will
be put into action to start calling the 1-900 phone number over and
over again to ask that it be played.
</P>
<P>
   What will it take for 6 Piece to succeed? They seem set to be
the Next Big Thing for teenage girls, at least for awhile.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they'll make it. It's a totally different type of
sound,'' says Mike Abrams, program director of 95.5 The Beat, who
thinks Starr's latest creation sound-- ``more R&AMP;B'' than Backstreet
Boys. ``They have a great stage show. They are hungry and
ambitious. Maurice Starr is still a big name in this industry, and
that will open doors.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with Starr's track record and clout _ beyond vocal coaches
and choreographers, Kevin says the business plan mentions an
appearance on ``Oprah Winfrey'' in the near future and someday, a
show at Philips Arena, downtown _ it seems a daunting challenge in
a pop music market teeming with cloned boy bands. In addition to
the two big moneymakers, Backstreet Boys and 'N Sync, there's
Boyzone, 98 Degrees, LFO, C-Note, 5IVE and Youngstown. There's even
a parody of the genre, a fictitious group called 2+gether, now
making the rounds on MTV's ``Total Request Live.'' And ABC is
creating a reality-based show (``Making the Band'') about the birth
of a boy band, which will air Friday nights.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's always room for another boy band,'' says Ellen
Jurcsak, editor of 16 Magazine. ``Exposure is a big part of it,
getting them out there where girls can see them and listen to their
music and get to know them a little bit. With that comes the desire
to know everything about them, to meet them, collect posters,
pinups. A lot of it has to do with luck.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Starr would have to concede that birthing a boy band can be
problematic, especially if the group makes it big. His own
creations, New Edition and New Kids on the Block, went on to seek
solo careers after a fairly short shelf life. Two of today's
hottest boy groups, Backstreet Boys and 'N Sync, have both sued
their creator _ Orlando mogul Lou Pearlman _ for bigger shares of
the pot and jumped ship to a different set of handlers.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin believes he made the right decision to put art college on
hold for awhile to give 6 Piece a shot. He says he is getting used
to ``being a character onstage,'' and that working a crowd in live
performance ``is an adrenaline rush, like a feeling I've never had
before.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fans are looking for a person who can touch them and make them
excited,'' he says. ``They want to see six good-looking guys
onstage who are pretending to sing just to them.''

 &HT;    Media blitz by Ramseys starts today
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If only Lt. Columbo were here. He'd walk away from John and
Patsy Ramsey, then turn unexpectedly, all rumpled and raspy, and
say, ``Uh, just one more question.''
</P>
<P>
   And we'd know who murdered JonBenet Ramsey.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, we are a nation of armchair Columbos, always asking,
but with the truth as elusive as ever. The maw of television opens
wide again, the Internet hyperventilates with invective, the
whodunit rattles our national cage.
</P>
<P>
   ``This story has moved beyond something that is merely
newsworthy to become a communal event, an experience,'' says
Matthew R. Kerbel, author of ``If it Bleeds, It Leads,'' a new book
that offers a scorching analysis of television news.
</P>
<P>
   Today marks a peak, if not in actual news, then in the communal
event that is our fascination with the Ramsey case. John and Patsy
Ramsey's book, ``The Death of Innocence'' (Thomas Nelson, Inc.,
$24.99) goes on sale today with a first printing run of 300,000
copies (several bookstores around the country jumped the gun,
claiming to be unaware of the publisher's embargo). At 10 tonight,
ABC airs a Barbara Walters interview with the Ramseys on ``20/20.''
</P>
<P>
   The publicity drumbeat continues next week with a live Internet
chat with the Ramseys at 10 p.m. Monday on the website ABC.com; a
five-part interview with Katie Couric on NBC's ``Today'' show; and
then a March 27 appearance on ``Larry King Live.'' The true
newsworthiness of any of these interviews is debatable; the Ramseys
say exactly what they said on CNN on Jan. 1, 1997, and on a British
documentary that ran on A&AMP;E in 1998: That they are innocent, that
they did not kill their 6-year-old daughter on Dec. 26, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``The audience loves it, and I'm curious to a point, but there's
got to be something new,'' CNN's King said in January. ``I don't
think there's been any real development in the last 12 shows we've
done.''
</P>
<P>
   The book publication and media blitz are new, but that's not
necessarily the same as being news.
</P>
<P>
   The very notion of ``news'' in the Ramsey case has been
slippery, as the level of journalism has been a shocking mix of
laziness and aggressiveness resulting in a blur of misinformation
and misleading leaks that surpasses even Clinton-Lewinsky, along
with the usual speculation, blind alleys and ax-grinding.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm amazed that the whole world doesn't think we're guilty,
given what they've been told,'' John Ramsey tells Walters in
tonight's interview. And indeed, many do think he and/or his wife
Patsy are guilty, and see their book and the well-orchestrated TV
appearances as a cynical manipulation. But many others see the
Ramseys as innocents, unjustly persecuted by a Boulder police force
that rushed to judgment, and by a ravenous media in which
distinctions between tabloid and mainstream no longer hold.
</P>
<P>
   The book itself, ``The Death of Innocence'' (the 10th book about
the case) is 396 grueling pages, in which the Ramseys describe
their last three years and three months in detail; outline the case
that an intruder killed JonBenet; and wreak extended vengeance on
the Boulder police and the national media. Although the supermarket
tabloid The Globe gets it the worst (Geraldo Rivera is second),
they also poke at CNN, citing their devastation when they heard
former talk-show host Mary Tillotson say JonBenet looked like ``a
hooker'' when she dressed for child beauty pageants. They refer to
MSNBC (the cable venture of NBC and Microsoft) as ``the video
tabloid brought to us by Bill Gates and GE.''
</P>
<P>
   But frequently in ``The Death of Innocence,'' the media is just
an undifferentiated mob, a perpetual stalking machine both in
Colorado and in Atlanta, where the Ramseys now live in a house on
West Paces Ferry Road.
</P>
<P>
   They turned down nearly all interview requests; ``we did not
feel obligated to fill their time slots with macabre
entertainment,'' they write.
</P>
<P>
   Now, of course, there is no other way to publicize their book
but to present themselves as ``macabre entertainment'' in the media
they despise. Thomas Nelson, a Nashville Christian publishing
house, set up the carefully calibrated appearances on the Ramseys'
behalf.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted these interviews to air when the book is in
bookstores,'' says Jeff Zucker, executive producer of ``Today.''
``If we hadn't agreed, they wouldn't have taped it.'' So Couric
interviewed the Ramseys in late February, as did Walters, and their
news organizations agreed in advance not to air the interviews
until the book's release.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not unique,'' says Zucker. ``We've seen this on other
books of major interest; Colin Powell's book comes to mind.''
</P>
<P>
   If this extended dance is indeed about news, it's just as much
about promotion. But as Matthew Kerbel notes, ``The public creates
the demand; the media feeds the demand.''
</P>
<P>
   On ``20/20'' tonight, Walters is tough but not vicious,
definitely not in her super-sympathetic mode. She tells the couple
that to many people, the videos of JonBenet in beauty pageants look
``perverted.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That didn't come from JonBenet; that came from the viewer,''
Patsy responds.
</P>
<P>
   Walters also reviews the evidence that an intruder killed
JonBenet (as does the current Newsweek, as does the book), but the
show is aimed more at the casual follower of the case rather than
the hard-core obsessives.
</P>
<P>
   For those, the Internet is the medium of choice. The Ramsey case
is unmeasurably huge in cyberspace. One popular webpage lists 118
links to the case, but each link leads to countless more. Susan
Bennett, a homemaker in North Carolina whose Internet site led to
her becoming friends with the Ramseys, being questioned by the
police and being threatened by Internet crazies, has a timeline of
the case that runs more than 3,000 printed pages.
</P>
<P>
   She also runs one of the many Internet forums, where thousands
of people speculate endlessly (and sometimes mindlessly) on the
case.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a hobby for some,'' says Bennett. ``Some are there
because they really care about JonBenet, some are there because
their lives are lacking something.'' She agrees with the notion
that many, but not all, Ramsey case fanatics are armchair
detectives, sifting through the clues in an effort to solve the
case.
</P>
<P>
   While Bennett's site is independent but pro-Ramsey, other sites
argue so strongly for the guilt of one or both parents that a Net
acronym was coined, based on a ``Star Trek'' alien race: BORG, or
Bent On Ramsey Guilt. Even the sleaziest media outposts have at
least some standards _ fear of libel, if nothing else _ but the
Ramsey obsessives on the Net, many of whom post using anonymous
names, are completely unfettered. They attack the Ramseys, the
police, the district attorney, and one another.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Patsy and I have lived through might go down in history
as the first cyberspace lynching,'' John writes in ``Innocence.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What you have here is the blurring of the line between reality
and fiction,'' says Kerbel. ``A real murder happened. People then
latched onto the mystery of it, the celebrity, and became
captivated by it, as if it was a whodunit novel.'' This one,
though, had more clues than any self-respecting ``Columbo'' would
ever allow: the bizarre ransom note, the stun gun, the DNA, the
garotte, the duct tape, the shoeprint, the snow outside the house
(or lack of it).
</P>
<P>
   ``So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back
ceaselessly into the past.'' F. Scott Fitzgerald closed his novel
``The Great Gatsby'' with that line 75 years ago. Now it describes
us all: the media talking heads, the cyber-sleuths, and even the
Ramseys themselves. The nature of modern news, with every day a new
cycle, makes it seem as if we're moving forward. But we really just
keep going back, and going back, trying to figure it out.

   WHITINGHAM, Vt. _ Early spring quickens in this state's southern
mountain hamlets with the first rising curls of wood smoke from
roadside sugar houses and the sweet fragrance of newly boiled amber
maple syrup served pure and plain in thin paper cups.
</P>
<P>
   For an aficionado like Leon Corse there is no comparison between
name-brand pancake varietals, which he scorns as Karo corn syrup
with a little flavoring _ ``Just read the label'' _ and the various
grades of golden maple syrup that for six generations his farm
family has made by tapping sugar-maple trees in the chill air of
the Green Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   When the weather is kind, and the transparent sap is dripping
from his farm's nearly 10,000 tree taps, Corse and his family are
fond of calling their 400 acres in Whitingham ``the Land of Milk
and Maple Syrup.'' But unlike a winery, a sugar house gets just one
chance a year to prove the mettle of its maple with fresh tastings
for amateur connoisseurs: for only about 45 days in the spring,
when the nights are cold and the days are warm enough to coax the
sap to flow.
</P>
<P>
   Just in the last two weeks Corse and dozens of other farmers in
this informal pancake zone have started the annual ritual of
sugaring, a craft handed down through generations. This is the time
when farmers stock giant King evaporators with cords of dry wood to
boil the sap collected in hundreds of buckets that hang from the
local sugar maples like silver charms.
</P>
<P>
   And it is a fleeting opportunity for tourists to experience the
small-town spell of a pancake breakfast flapped by the local Lions
or an afternoon luncheon or ham supper prepared a la maple by
groups like the Ladies Benevolent Society of Whitingham or the E-Z
Riders Snowmobile Club.
</P>
<P>
   Vermont is, after all, the top producer of maple syrup in the
United States, with 370,000 gallons last year, or more than a third
of all the maple syrup in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Quebec and Ontario are actually the largest producers, but that
doesn't deter the city of St. Albans in northern Vermont from
dubbing itself ``the Maple Sugar Capital of the World'' and
celebrating that boast with an annual festival and parade that
features sugar house demonstrations, maple syrup contests, snacks
of maple sugar on snow, and a supper featuring the selection of
maple sugar royalty.
</P>
<P>
   But by the time St. Albans is crowning its king and queen of
maple, the prime sugaring season is over. So now is the time to
head for farms in Pennsylvania, Vermont, New Hampshire and New York
for the chance to taste maple syrup fresh from a throbbing
evaporator while discussing recipe tips for maple-baked ham
directly with the farmer.
</P>
<P>
   The hamlet of Whitingham, about 220 miles north of New York
City, is celebrating its own annual Maple Sugar Festival next
weekend, so tourists _ or flatlanders, as visitors are sometimes
called here _ can taste fresh syrup samples. The doors will be open
at 8 of the 18 sugar houses in the area, which are scattered along
two-lane roads or nestled in a gulch reachable by horse-drawn
sleigh if the snow has not melted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call it liquid gold,'' said Edmund McLaughlin, a retired
health-care executive who has become the town's chief maple sugar
booster. ``It's part of the fabric of the lifestyle here.''
</P>
<P>
   With a population of 1,182, Whitingham, including the village of
Jacksonville, revolves around a bend in the road on Route 100 that
is the town center. There's a sprawling white municipal center
building, a general store, a firehouse and a library that's open
three days a week. Whitingham is so small that there is no public
telephone in the town center and none to be found within six miles.
</P>
<P>
   It is most fabled for a native son who left: Brigham Young was
born here and eventually led thousands of Mormons across the Rocky
Mountains to found Salt Lake City in 1847. On an isolated hilltop
in Whitingham stands a white granite monument with a curious
inscription, which may have figured in its mysterious disappearance
and reappearance last year after a tour group of Mormons paid a
visit to the town: ``Brigham Young. Born on this spot 1801. A man
of much courage and superb equipment.''
</P>
<P>
   Many transplanted flatlanders have come for a visit to the Green
Mountains and never left, seduced by rural charms. Patience
Merriman moved to Whitingham five years ago from Philadelphia to
work for the local newspaper, The Deerfield Valley News, and as a
freelance writer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been an education,'' she said. ``The first couple of
years I just wandered around in a kind of daze, not really
believing I would never wear high heels or panytyhose again, or
that I would end up sitting on a folding chair in the basement of
the Town Hall covering a zoning board meeting during which there
was a break for ice cream and maple syrup.''
</P>
<P>
   Northeast of Whitingham in Halifax _ along a dirt road that
thaws and freezes daily in the early spring _ the former Long
Islanders Bill and Patti Pusey operate a working farm and a
bed-and-breakfast that they have built up over the last 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   In March the 100-year-old sugar maples shadowing the Shearer
Hill Farm are hung with metal sap buckets, which are collected by
Pusey and an assortment of relatives and visiting friends who come
from all over the Eastern Seaboard to, in effect, work for maple
syrup. On one weekend a Rhode Island trial lawyer, Bob Iuliano,
tried to forget the stresses of the courtroom by doing volunteer
duty in the sugar shack, where the evaporator was working till well
past 10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``We love it,'' said Pusey, who offers guests freshly made maple
syrup drizzled on her home-baked apple betty. ``It's just such a
magical time of the year: to take 40 gallons of sap and turn it
into a gallon of syrup. We like the late hours. We like the sugar
house.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very highly concentrated time of year. And every time
you use the maple syrup, you revisit the experience. You can't help
but reflect on gathering the sap, emptying the buckets from the
tree, being knee deep in mud.''
</P>
<P>
   In Vermont, various legends circulate about the origins of maple
syrup. But all the tales contain a few basic elements.
</P>
<P>
   In early spring an Indian leaves a bowl sitting below the base
of tree. Drips of sap collect in the bowl, but the liquid looks
like water. Maple syrup is discovered when the Indian boils the
``water,'' and it reduces to an amber treat.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the history of the United States, maple syrup has
been valued not only for its taste but also for its potential
political power. Thomas Jefferson argued that maple sugar (which is
produced by further boiling the syrup) offered a means of
self-sufficiency for early settlers. Abolitionists theorized that
the increased production of maple sugar could cripple the slave
trade by reducing demand for imported cane and beet sugars, which
were grown with slave labor.
</P>
<P>
   Today the power of maple sugar lies in its sweetness and the
nostalgic memories that it evokes. There are, after all, only a few
weekends when a traveler can spot the smoke rising from a sugar
house like the one at Whetstone Valley Farm on Cooke Road in
Brattleboro and taste Fancy Grade A, warm, golden and steaming from
the boiler.

`WINTER SLEEPERS': AGAINST A GORGEOUS LANDSCAPE, YOUNG ADULTS
LACKING IN VISION 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes are at end of review) 
(af) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   To the gleaming tinkle of ``Tubular Bells''-like music, the
camera in Tom Tykwer's film ``Winter Sleepers'' swoops like a
reckless downhill skier across the peaks and along the icy roads
surrounding a picturesque skiing village in the German mountains.
</P>
<P>
   The gorgeously photographed film by the German director of ``Run
Lola Run'' distills the beauty and peril of this wintry environment
with a laserlike concentration that virtually blows a cloud of snow
in your face. In an early scene, as a car skids off a mountain road
and plunges into a snowbank, the sickening crunch of the vehicle
hurtling into a drift is so perfectly coordinated with a shot of
snow slamming into the windshield that for that split second you
might as well be behind the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winter Sleepers'' has many such breathtaking moments in which
sounds and images synergize with an explosive precision. In one
extraordinary scene in a hospital, the beep of a machine monitoring
a patient's vital signs slowly bleeds into an exquisitely sad piece
of music that extends the machine's pulse and captures the despair
of the nurse watching over the patient.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the film, a skier racing down a slope leaps over a
ledge and into free fall to the strains of Arvo Part's ``Elegy for
Benjamin Britten,'' a piece that seems suspended in midair as its
descending melodic circles suggest a slow-motion dive into an
eternal void.
</P>
<P>
   These thrillingly virtuosic cinematic feats add tremendous
resonance to the stories of five intersecting characters. Laura
(Marie-Lou Sellem), a nurse and would-be actress who is appearing
in a local production of ``A Streetcar Named Desire,'' shares a
house with Rebecca (Floriane Daniel), a beautiful, indolent
translator who is having an affair with Marco (Heino Ferch), a
handsome, hotheaded ski instructor.
</P>
<P>
   As we follow a relationship that is one long, bickering power
struggle interrupted by passionate interludes, Rebecca and Marco
emerge as spoiled, aimless young adults out of touch with any deep
set of values.
</P>
<P>
   One afternoon while Marco and Rebecca are making love, Rene
(Ulrich Matthes), a gaunt young movie projectionist from the
village, goes out for a walk and happens upon Marco's brand-new
sports car, which is parked in front of Rebecca's house with the
keys in the ignition.
</P>
<P>
   Impulsively, he decides to take it for a spin. Minutes later the
car skids off the highway to avoid a collision with a vehicle
driven by Theo (Josef Bierbichler), a middle-aged farmer taking his
sick horse to the vet in an attached trailer.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't until after the accident, when she is discovered
unconscious and gravely injured, that Theo realizes his young
daughter had stowed away in the trailer. Meanwhile, Rene, fighting
his way out of the snow, walks away from the accident, leaving the
stolen car buried and invisible from the roadside. Later, when Theo
insists that another vehicle was involved, no one believes him.
</P>
<P>
   The circle of connection among the characters is completed when
Laura becomes one of the nurses watching over Theo's comatose
daughter at the village's clinic. She and Rene, who suffers from
chronic short-term memory loss as a result of an old head injury,
also become romantically involved. Rene, to try to refresh his
memory of the previous day's events, habitually takes snapshots
wherever he goes.
</P>
<P>
   If the characters in ``Winter Sleepers,'' adapted from a novel
by Francoise Pyszora, don't begin to harmonize with the beauty and
terror of the landscape, they're not supposed to. For ``Winter
Sleepers'' is really about the malaise of young Germans (except for
Theo, all the characters are in their late 20s or 30s) who appear
spiritually and morally unconscious.
</P>
<P>
   The short-term memory loss of Rene (who at odd moments resembles
Anthony Perkins in ``Psycho'') is a rather forced metaphor for his
generation's lack of larger vision. The movie leaves deliberately
unclear exactly what Rene remembers and what he forgets.
</P>
<P>
   Although Marco and Rebecca seem to have everything life could
offer, they emerge as spoiled brats who idly flirt with others.
Among the four, Marco offers the sourest observations about life in
general. He questions the value of human longevity and suggests
that the most anyone can expect in life is ``three good years.''
</P>
<P>
   If ``Winter Sleepers'' is very different in tone and style from
``Run Lola Run,'' the beat-driven, jet propelled, MTV-style race
against time that put Tykwer on the map as a hot international
filmmaker, it deals with many of the same themes.
</P>
<P>
   Both movies ruminate (``Winter Sleepers'' in its angst-ridden
way, ``Lola'' in its frenzied live-action cartoon style) on how
human destiny has everything to do with timing and the instant and
endless chains of causality that ripple from a single chance
encounter. Or, as the song ``What a Difference a Day Makes,''
featured prominently in ``Lola,'' reminds us, what seems like
chance can create ``the sun and the flowers where there used to be
rain.'' Of course, it also works the other way around.
</P>
<P>
   Together, ``Lola'' and ``Winter Sleepers'' confirm Tykwer as a
somewhat cold but dazzling cinematic magician whose movies can
conjure whole worlds with just the snap of a shutter, then make
them vanish just as quickly. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Things and stuff like _ well, you know _ things and
stuff are what make the world go round in ``American Buffalo,''
David Mamet's career-making conversion of sooty, carbon speech into
diamond-hard theater. ``You want to tell me what this thing is?''
begins a typical exchange. Or: ``Forget the thing.'' Or: ``The
thing, it ran two years.'' The listeners in the play, by the way,
know exactly what the speakers mean. So do we.
</P>
<P>
   In this 1975 tale of a crime that never happens, which opened
Thursday night in a brisk, oddly breezy revival starring William H.
Macy, the words that carry the most weight are those nonspecific
nouns that have long been the refuge of verbally challenged English
speakers: things and stuff, for sure, not to mention the assortment
of cruder, four-letter equivalents that made theatergoers prick up
and even cover their ears 25 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Yet out of the collision of monosyllables that spring from the
mouths of the play's three hapless crooks, a painstaking pattern
emerges, centered on, as it happens, a two-syllable word: business.
That noun hisses like a riled cobra through the current production
of ``American Buffalo,'' directed by Neal Pepe as the third
offering in the Mamet season from the Atlantic Theater Company and
already a hot ticket.
</P>
<P>
   A quarter-century after it was first performed, instantly
thrusting Mamet into the front line of a new generation of
dramatists, ``American Buffalo'' scarcely seems like a fossil. The
contemplation and pursuit of things and stuff (words that are
conveniently both abstract and material) is, after all, what
continues to keep this country moving. The marginal urban losers of
``American Buffalo,'' self-defined entrepreneurs, are enduring
American archetypes, dark soulmates to the day traders of today.
</P>
<P>
   With the novelty of the play's brusque, blue dialogue long worn
off, it's the careful, bravura manipulation of language to thematic
ends that seems most apparent now. The status of ``American
Buffalo'' as one of the most eloquently inarticulate plays ever
written remains secure. And this latest interpretation, previously
produced to cries of acclaim at the Donmar Warehouse in London,
cannot be faulted as a primer in Mamet semantics.
</P>
<P>
   The three-member cast, which also features Philip Baker Hall and
Mark Webber, has a disarmingly fluid command of Mametspeak; no one
lets on, as is often embarrassingly the case in less accomplished
productions, that what the actors are saying is in fact as
artificial as Elizabethan blank verse. There's a temperate quality,
too, in Pepe's direction that lets the wit and the linguistic
structure of the play shine more cleanly than ever.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, when did you ever hear a production of
``American Buffalo'' described as temperate? For all its wordiness,
this play, famously performed in New York in productions starring
Robert Duvall (1977) and Al Pacino (1981), has traditionally come
across as a fist in the face. This incarnation tickles and
occasionally offers a stinging slap, but it certainly doesn't knock
you out.
</P>
<P>
   The principal reason can be found in what is at once the show's
greatest asset and its greatest handicap. That's Macy as Teach,
whose long-winded philosophizing and paranoid rants justify his
nickname. In a play about bumblers, Teach is a virtuoso of
ineptitude, a nonstop, self-justifying spielmeister whose
cockiness, like that of sexual braggarts, is in inverse proportion
to his performance.
</P>
<P>
   Teach is a comic figure but also a scary one. That, in any case,
was how he registered as portrayed by Duvall and Pacino, who
respectively brought a cold fury and a maniacal fire to their
performances. They were very different interpretations, but each in
its way was a juggernaut, giving the plot its overcharged,
self-destructive engine.
</P>
<P>
   Macy comes to Teach with a formidable pedigree in Mamet
portrayals, ranging from Bobby the addict (played here by Webber)
in the original ``Buffalo'' at the Goodman Theater in Chicago to
the harassed and harassing professor of ``Oleanna.'' That he knows
how to talk the talk, with enough confidence to shade it in
unexpected ways, is not in question.
</P>
<P>
   But as anyone knows who has seen Macy's sterling work in films
like ``Fargo'' and the current ``Magnolia,'' his particular
strength is in conveying a brittle anxiety. No matter what heinous
deeds his characters perpetrate, they exude the sense of someone
who expects to be caught out any minute. His performances may be
pitched just short of the snapping point, but he usually seems more
on the verge of collapse and confession than explosion.
</P>
<P>
   Applying this sweaty self-consciousness to Teach isn't
inappropriate. It certainly makes you see the character from a
fresh angle, and it's fun watching the variations on the dance of
aggression and retreat that provides the central rhythm of Macy's
performance.
</P>
<P>
   But you can't imagine this skinny fellow, who with his
slicked-back hair and hopelessly unsuave mustache looks like a
dropout from a school for gigolos, selling anyone on any idea,
especially not the sturdy, seasoned junk store owner played by
Hall. This Teach backs down as quickly as an undersized schoolyard
bully, and when he finally erupts into violence, your inclination
is less to shrink back than to drape your arm over his shoulders
and mutter, ``There, there.''
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the dynamic of this ``Buffalo'' feels more like a lope
than a stampede. Hall's Don, who presides over Kevin Rigdon's
spectacularly cluttered secondhand store setting, is tough but also
benignly paternal. And the young Webber, who gives a beautifully
natural-feeling interpretation, seems to radiate an almost
untarnished innocence.
</P>
<P>
   Combined, the three performances give off a strangely sweet,
likable quality, but there's not much urgency to them. The evening
as a whole has a puzzling feeling of distance, when what I remember
from earlier versions of the play is how it grabbed you by the
lapels.
</P>
<P>
   The advantage of this distance is that it does let you savor the
music of Mamet's ingeniously shaped sentences, with their cadenced
twists and repetitions. It's a pleasure, for instance, to hear
Hall's Don talking on the phone, saying, ``Lookit, Sir, if I could
get ahold of some of the stuff you were interested in, would you be
interested in some of it?'' Or Macy's Teach, after making an
awkward apology, defensively asking, ``What do you want me to do?
Dress up and lick him all over?''
</P>
<P>
   It all makes a pleasant, faintly academic night at the theater.
Pleasant? Academic? It seems hard to believe that the play under
discussion is ``American Buffalo.''

 &HT;    MORE SPRAWL UNAVOIDABLE, ACADEMICS SAY
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ More suburban sprawl in Texas and the Southeast
appears unavoidable, a group of Harvard University urban planners
warned Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``No growth is not an option,'' Nicolas Retsinas, director of
the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard's graduate schools
of design and government, said at a Capitol Hill luncheon. Not only
will the number of Americans double within the next century, he
said, but immigration will add to population pressures.
</P>
<P>
   The growth will not be spread evenly across the country.
California will lead the way, but Texas, Georgia and Florida will
be among the other rapidly growing states, he said.
</P>
<P>
   And because the number of households is growing even faster than
the population, housing needs will escalate.
</P>
<P>
   Continuing a trend that began at the end of World War II, most
of this housing growth will be horizontal rather than vertical,
Retsinas said. Already, the growth in non-metro areas is about as
rapid as in cities and their suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   At the luncheon, Retsinas and other academics spoke to a handful
of lawmakers attending a ``Congressional Initiative for Livable
Communities.'' The initiative's goal is to develop a federal
response to the problems of sprawl that have plagued expanding
metropolitan areas such as Atlanta and Austin: two-hour commutes,
disappearing farmland, and strip-mall architecture described as
``suburban acne.''
</P>
<P>
   Sprawl is a product of prosperity, the planners said. A record
67 percent of households now own homes, and buyers want bigger
houses. The median size for a new home in 1998 was 2,200 square
feet, compared to 1,500 square feet in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   Also, more families can afford two or more cars, the planners
said. That makes living in the exurbs more feasible _ and
exacerbates sprawl.
</P>
<P>
   But sprawl is not restricted to the prosperous. In some rapidly
growing areas, high-density rental apartment complexes are being
built on what was recently pasture.
</P>
<P>
   Jobs as well as people are moving outward, he said, as the
concept of cities as employment centers is changing. Increasingly,
people are working as well as living in medium- to low-density
counties.
</P>
<P>
   To control sprawl, cities must be made more liveable, said Rep.
Robert Weygand, D-R.I., a landscape architect. To that end, federal
programs to improve urban schools, fight urban crime, stimulate
urban job growth and improve urban housing could all be considered
part of an anti-sprawl policy.
</P>
<P>
   The planners said Congress should also encourage regional
governmental planning for growth. In the West and South, the
populations are not only going to grow faster but also will be
composed more of Hispanics and Asians, Retsinas said, and the needs
of these areas will differ from those in the slower-growing
Midwest.

   TULA, Russia _ At 9 a.m. one day last week Stanislav Petrovich
was well into his working day. He already had answered a two-hour
barrage of phone calls and organized a daily schedule for an
adrenaline-packed group of volunteers assembled at the Tula
regional Communist Party headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   With Russian presidential elections less than one week away,
many Moscow pundits have already called the vote, saying it's not a
question of whether Acting President Vladimir Putin will win, but
by how many votes.
</P>
<P>
   But don't tell this to Petrovich and the rest of the
half-million Communist Party faithful toiling to make their
candidate Gennady Zyuganov Russia's next president.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are calling from all over wanting to know how they can
help defeat Putin,'' said Petrovich, a clean-cut 46-year-old
economics teacher and the party chairman in the Tula region. ``They
don't believe this election is a done deal.''
</P>
<P>
   While Putin's lead is undeniably strong _ he leads Zyuganov, his
nearest competitor, by a 2-to-1 margin _ nearly half of the Russian
electorate will not be voting for the 47-year-old former KGB
officer on March 26, according to the latest poll figures.
</P>
<P>
   Some voters say they don't like Putin's secret service past.
Some think he's a dictator in disguise. But for Zyuganov and his
constituents, Putin represents the corrupt system of government
that flourished under former President Boris Yeltsin and led the
country into its current state of disrepair and depression.
</P>
<P>
   ``Putin is supported by the oligarchs that robbed our country of
its wealth. He's tied to all that by virtue of the fact that
Yeltsin anointed him as his successor,'' Zyuganov said in a recent
interview.
</P>
<P>
   This feeling runs strong throughout Tula Oblast, a largely
agricultural region roughly the size of Ohio. Only 200 miles south
of Moscow, the opportunities of open markets and democracy have
passed by most of the region's population.
</P>
<P>
   Besides farming, defense factories like the one that builds
Kalashnikov rifles kept people employed in the Soviet days. But in
the last 10 years, this economic infrastructure has rusted to a
halt, leaving people disenfranchised and impoverished.
</P>
<P>
   In December's parliamentary elections, about 30 percent of the
region voted for the Communists, while less than 10 percent voted
for Putin's electoral bloc, Unity. Like-minded voters across the
country handed the Communists more seats in parliament than any
other single party.
</P>
<P>
   Zyuganov attributes this popularity to the fact that he and
other leaders have redefined the party's ideology away from
classical Marxism and towards a socialism practiced by many
European countries. He says he wants to increase social spending,
but at the same time increase tax collection and stem capital
flight to pay for the expenditures.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not looking to turn back the clock, or repeat mistakes
of the past,'' the solid, ruddy-faced former schoolteacher said in
a recent interview. ``We want to go forward, like Lenin said.''
</P>
<P>
   But while travelling past snow-whitened wheat fields and
tumble-down wooden houses with Communist Party campaign volunteers
to deliver election literature to the small towns in Tula Oblast
last week, visitors see it's nostalgia that seems to be driving
voters to turn toward Zyuganov.
</P>
<P>
   Sergei Semonov, a 50-year-old unemployed miner from Kiryevsky,
said he's watched his town die a slow death. Since 1990, 10 of its
12 iron mines have closed, and the population has dwindled from
105,000 to less than 80,000, as young people leave in droves.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've heard of the Stalin gulags? Well, I'm living in a
Yeltsin gulag. I have no job, but there is nowhere for my family
and I to go. Even if I could find work in some other town, where
would we live? I can't sell my apartment and I have no money to
rent another. I'm trapped,'' Semonov said.
</P>
<P>
   His neighbor Yelena Antonova, 42, said she didn't trust Putin,
even when he promised to crack down on corruption, and increase
minimum wage and social security payments for the elderly _ three
promises Zyuganov has also made to voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Zyuganov isn't in it for the money or the prestige. He's
running for the people. With Putin, I just don't know,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In Tula's provincial capital, where signs of economic resurgence
flourish along the tree-lined main street called Lenin Prospect,
citizens feel less inclined towards the Communists. They tend to
shy away from Putin also for economic reasons, but for different
ones than the Zyuganov electorate, who hope the government will
guarantee employment once again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say I lived poorly under the Communist system, but now
I've found a different way to live,'' said 46-year-old Valery
Ivanov, the assistant director of a private publishing company, a
business he and a group of friends started five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Voting for Putin is madness. Only a fool would vote for a
candidate without an economic plan. I have no idea what he stands
for,'' Ivanov, an earnest man with ink-stained hands, added.
``(Gregory) Yavlinsky (the leader of the liberal Yabloko party) is
the only solution. He's the only intelligent person who can help us
now.''

 &HT;    MORE SPRAWL UNAVOIDABLE, ACADEMICS SAY
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ More suburban sprawl in Texas and the Southeast
appears unavoidable, a group of Harvard University urban planners
warned Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``No growth is not an option,'' Nicolas Retsinas, director of
the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard's graduate schools
of design and government, said at a Capitol Hill luncheon. Not only
will the number of Americans double within the next century, he
said, but immigration will add to population pressures.
</P>
<P>
   The growth will not be spread evenly across the country.
California will lead the way, but Texas, Georgia and Florida will
be among the other rapidly growing states, he said.
</P>
<P>
   And because the number of households is growing even faster than
the population, housing needs will escalate.
</P>
<P>
   Continuing a trend that began at the end of World War II, most
of this housing growth will be horizontal rather than vertical,
Retsinas said. Already, the growth in non-metro areas is about as
rapid as in cities and their suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   At the luncheon, Retsinas and other academics spoke to a handful
of lawmakers attending a ``Congressional Initiative for Livable
Communities.'' The initiative's goal is to develop a federal
response to the problems of sprawl that have plagued expanding
metropolitan areas such as Atlanta and Austin: two-hour commutes,
disappearing farmland, and strip-mall architecture described as
``suburban acne.''
</P>
<P>
   Sprawl is a product of prosperity, the planners said. A record
67 percent of households now own homes, and buyers want bigger
houses. The median size for a new home in 1998 was 2,200 square
feet, compared to 1,500 square feet in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   Also, more families can afford two or more cars, the planners
said. That makes living in the exurbs more feasible _ and
exacerbates sprawl.
</P>
<P>
   But sprawl is not restricted to the prosperous. In some rapidly
growing areas, high-density rental apartment complexes are being
built on what was recently pasture.
</P>
<P>
   Jobs as well as people are moving outward, he said, as the
concept of cities as employment centers is changing. Increasingly,
people are working as well as living in medium- to low-density
counties.
</P>
<P>
   To control sprawl, cities must be made more liveable, said Rep.
Robert Weygand, D-R.I., a landscape architect. To that end, federal
programs to improve urban schools, fight urban crime, stimulate
urban job growth and improve urban housing could all be considered
part of an anti-sprawl policy.
</P>
<P>
   The planners said Congress should also encourage regional
governmental planning for growth. In the West and South, the
populations are not only going to grow faster but also will be
composed more of Hispanics and Asians, Retsinas said, and the needs
of these areas will differ from those in the slower-growing
Midwest.

GILLIAN ANDERSON CALLS THE SHOTS 
</HEADLINE>

prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative
DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at 732-390-4697.)

 (Includes a color slide and a black-and-white photo of Gillian
Anderson directing a scene from ``The X-Files.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    Gillian Anderson is a Leo.
 &HT;    As such, the actress says, she's ``good at being bossy.'' And
that came in handy after she convinced creator/producer Chris
Carter to let her make her writing and directing debuts with ``All
Things,'' an episode of ``The X-Files'' that will air April 9.
 &HT;    ``What happened was that I sat down right after a conversation
with my manager and started writing an outline for the entire
episode,'' Anderson says. ``I didn't plan on that _ all the
characters came out. All the beats came out, and everything just
flowed onto the page. I guess it was needing to get out there
somewhere.
 &HT;    ``The next day I went in and pitched the idea to Chris Carter,''
she recalls, ``and I told him that if I were going to write it I
also wanted to direct it. He said, `Great. Begin, and show me what
you have when you have it.'
 &HT;    ``And I kind of started from there.''
 &HT;    Anderson's story _ which writer/producer Frank Spotnitz helped
give that ``X-Files'' touch _ finds Scully (Anderson) grappling
with sins from her past when she encounters Dr. Daniel Waterston
and his daughter, Maggie. It seems that Scully and Waterston had an
affair years earlier, a dalliance that wrecked Waterston's family
and compelled Scully to join the FBI.
 &HT;    As the hour unfolds, it explores issues of fate and faith vs.
unpredictability and doubt, love of family vs. emotional escape
into loneliness and the clinical vs. the beautiful. Amid all of
that, fans of the relationship between Scully and Mulder (David
Duchovny) are in for a tasty treat. There's even a visit of sorts
from God.
 &HT;    ``One of the concepts I wanted to imbue the script with is the
idea that we are guided, in a sense, through our lives,'' Anderson
says during a conversation from her ``X-Files'' trailer on the Fox
lot in Hollywood. ``There are reasons for so-called coincidences.
 &HT;    ``That was the initial concept behind the script,'' she says,
``and it's hard to say where all the other aspects of it came into
being, from Scully's relationship with a man from her past to the
man's relationship with his daughter.
 &HT;    ``I can't even say how those came up,'' she concludes. ``I don't
know _ I just don't know.''
 &HT;    Anderson overcame serious jitters to discover that directing
wasn't quite as tough as she had anticipated.
 &HT;    ``I was terrified beforehand about how I was going to figure
stuff out in terms of what shots I needed and how one melded into
the next, what lenses to use and all of that,'' she says. ``I was
actually pleasantly surprised by how much had just sunk in over the
last seven years.
 &HT;    ``I also had one of our regular directors, Kim Manners, as my
right-hand man, to lead me through it,'' the actress adds. ``I was
able to prep, do shot lists and then show up and actually know
where we were going to go, how many shots we needed to do, how I
wanted to see it visually and everything like that.''
 &HT;    Directing her co-star worked out perfectly well, too.
 &HT;    ``David only worked a day and a half on the episode,'' Anderson
says. ``It went fine. He showed up and he was prepared.''
 &HT;    Anderson believes she got the episode she sought to achieve, but
will reserve final judgment until after she completes the editing
process.
 &HT;    By that time, however, another unknown _ the future of ``The
X-Files'' itself _ will likely have been decided, perhaps
distracting from ``All Things.''
 &HT;    The actress reiterates that she does not want to return for an
eighth season, but has two new points to add: She wouldn't be
interested in forging on without Duchovny, nor in playing Scully as
a recurring role on the possible Lone Gunmen spinoff, the pilot of
which recently wrapped production in Vancouver.
 &HT;    ``The dilemma we're in right now is we've got four more episodes
to shoot, and we may not know if it's going for another year until
we've got two more episodes to shoot,'' Anderson says, sounding
both forceful and sad. ``For them to suddenly come and say, `You
know what? You're not going to do this anymore,' would be a blow to
the stomach.
 &HT;    ``That would give us two episodes to go through a mourning
process that we should have had at least six months to go
through,'' she says. ``At that point, when it becomes, `Oh my God,
do we let this go or do we go on?,' of course we're going to not
want to let go of it.
 &HT;    ``We'll feel, `We've been doing this for seven years, and we've
only got two more to do together,''' she says. ``We'd want to
extend it a little bit more.''
 &HT;    Anderson pauses for a moment, searching for the right words.
 &HT;    ``It's kind of an awkward and unfortunate situation that
everyone is in right now, not the least of whom is Chris Carter,''
she says. ``If this is the last season, he has to wrap it up in two
episodes.
 &HT;    ``It's going to be insane.''

`BEYOND THE MAT': IDOLS TO LOOK DOWN ON, SOMETIMES 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes are at end of review) 
(af) 
 By ELVIS MITCHELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Can you imagine the level of a mind that watches wrestling?''
huffs the supercilious Max von Sydow in Woody Allen's ``Hannah and
Her Sisters.'' The director Barry W. Blaustein includes that clip
in ``Beyond the Mat,'' his documentary tracking his own obsession
with professional wrestling, a devotion that began at age 8. His
apparently is just the sort of mind that watches wrestling.
</P>
<P>
   The sport is ``theater at its most basic,'' says Blaustein, who
also narrates and appears in the film. Theater at its most base is
probably closer to the point. Blaustein doesn't dwell on the
history of wrestling since his fascination began, when it was a de
facto pro sports league with wrestlers heaving insults, challenges
and eventually chairs at each other.
</P>
<P>
   He moves through that quickly to get to Vince McMahon, the
hustler-savant behind the World Wrestling Federation, who made pro
wrestling even more shameless, a concept you no doubt thought
impossible.
</P>
<P>
   McMahon, who has the doughy, slightly gone-to-seed good looks of
a 1950s movie star after a few too many helpings of his favorite,
chicken pesto pasta, at the WWF. Cafe, has a keen description of
what the federation does. ``What we're really about: we make
movies,'' he says with the self-satisfied smirk he constantly wears
_ movies for the kind of people who find the nuanced character
development of the later ``Kickboxer'' movies to get in the way of
the action.
</P>
<P>
   McMahon is the Willie Wonka of pro wrestling, and his factory
includes in-house costume design and composers flailing away on the
whammy bar of an electric guitar to crank out the volume-crunching
martial rock that would make Wagner wince. (The one thing the
wrestlers all have in common is a toneless, gravelly voice, the
result of forearms and flying drop kicks to the throat.)
</P>
<P>
   After spending a bit of time with McMahon, who is later seen
stepping into the ring as a villain (``Who wouldn't want to beat up
the boss?'' Blaustein says of McMahon's canniness), the director
travels the back roads of pro wrestling to a wrestling school run
by a bearded dumpling who, when not advising his guys to read food
labels for fat content, is training them to join the ranks of the
few, the loud, the WWF.
</P>
<P>
   Blaustein tracks down a childhood idol, the 50-ish Terry Funk,
who hauls his athletic body out of bed and into the ring for
Extreme Championship Wrestling, an organization that Blaustein
calls ``wrestling's Ellis Island'' but is more like the sport's
Island of Broken Toys.
</P>
<P>
   Blaustein is interested in families. He offers a portrait of
Mankind (Mick Foley), the pudgy behemoth who once wrestled in a
mask that looked like something Hannibal Lecter would wear on a
formal night out and is now concerned about the effect of his work
on his loving wife and children.
</P>
<P>
   Then he tracks down Jake Roberts, a part-time father whose days
of blood and glory are behind him. Roberts is reunited with his
20-something daughter, who is wary of her abandoning dad. ``He has
had a lot of encounters with demons,'' a promoter says of Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   This perverse set of family portraits is the way Blaustein wants
to present these wrestlers: as men who are coping, or not, with
real life and the ring. Funk is seen praying at his daughter's
wedding and, a few scenes later, with blood streaming from his
scarred brow at a match. The movie is at its most chilling when
Funk, with a bloody nose after purposely losing his last match,
bids farewell to the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beyond the Mat'' wants to blend thrills and pathos, getting at
the many sides of what is, as Blaustein describes it, a carny act.
The problem is that he doesn't articulate any of his own thoughts
beyond a few slight asides.
</P>
<P>
   The film is out to display the range of human drama, but his
idea of an insight to end with is that wrestlers ``are just like
you and me, except they're really different.'' If that's the best
he can up with after three years on the road, then he has no
confidence in himself or his subject. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `Beyond the Mat' is rated R (under 17 requires accompanying
parent or adult guardian). It includes on-the-mat violence and
on-camera confessions that some might find disturbing. &QL;

NO SURPRISE MOVES

<TEXT>
<P>
   Certain movies deserve two ratings: One for hardcore fans of the
movie's subject, another for people who just couldn't care less.
Consider the rating for this preaching-to-the-converted wrestling
documentary to be an average.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, pro wrestling is hot right now and has thousands,
probably millions, of fans. One of them is former ``Saturday Night
Live'' writer-producer Barry W. Blaustein, who became obsessed
enough with the sports-entertainment phenomenon to write and direct
his own movie about it. Blaustein finagled impressive access to the
wrestling world, and snagged extended time with legend Terry Funk,
current star Mick ``Mankind'' Foley and troubled celebrity Jake
``The Snake'' Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   What does Blaustein do with this access? Provide the
unsurprising revelation that although pro wrestling is completely
staged, the pain that results from the choreographed violence is
real _ and that wrestlers' families often wish they'd find
something else to do for a living. What we don't learn is why these
guys subject themselves to this violence for a living. Often, the
answer is just that they can't think of anything else to do. We
also don't learn why wrestling has become so huge that ``WWF
Smackdown!'' virtually rescued UPN from oblivion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beyond the Mat'' provides the kind of information that can
often be gleaned from Web sites or fanzines, but it does have
plenty of wrestling action thrown in for the faithful. It lapses
into bad taste, though, when it dwells on Mankind's terrified young
daughter as she watches her daddy take a vicious beating in the
ring. It's possible that Blaustein meant this as a cautionary move,
but his lack of irony and his continued enjoyment of the sport
indicate otherwise.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Admit to facing a first-time seeing of
``Riverdance,'' and a reviewer is peppered with advice. ``Be
nice,'' fans plead. ``Kill them,'' others hiss. ``Keep an open
mind,'' the peacemakers add.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially there is only one thing to say about the Irish music
and dance show, which has returned to New York for a limited run at
the Gershwin Theater. The phenomenon rolls on, as inexorably as the
sonorous voice of Liam Neeson summons up the pounding seas and dark
nights of Ireland in the taped text that runs through ``Riverdance
on Broadway,'' as this installment is called.
</P>
<P>
   The best of the show, seen in preview on Wednesday night, is the
step dancing. Battalions of fast-moving men and women race about
the stage in strict formation, bodies rigid except for their
chattering feet and scissoring legs. Led by Pat Roddy and Eileen
Martin, two young world Irish dance champions who look innocently
pleased at this turn their lives have taken, the Riverdance Irish
Dance Troupe surges along, moving in unison to exciting effect.
</P>
<P>
   The musicians, ranged at the sides of the stage, have a
charmingly impish look, and their playing is another plus when you
can hear it over the overamplification. Robbie Harris, who plays a
small drum called the bodhran, is a cheeky delight. Athena Tergis'
dancing feet fly almost as fast as her hand bows her fiddle. And
Kenneth Edge's haunting saxophone solo, in a duet with Ivan Goff on
the uillean pipe, steals the heart in one of the show's few moments
of genuine emotion.
</P>
<P>
   As before, ``Riverdance'' incorporates dance and music from
other nations. Walter ``Sundance'' Freeman nearly steals the show
with his ebullient tap and street-dance solo, in a trio of fine
tappers completed by Channing Cook Holmes and Karen Calloway
Williams. The Moscow Folk Ballet Company injects some high-flying
Moiseyev-style acrobatics into the proceedings, and the Amanzi
Singers from South Africa get the house rocking with their vibrant
music. Noel Heraty completes the cast of soloists.
</P>
<P>
   The lead singers _ Tsidii Le Loka of ``Lion King'' fame, the
Irish pop singer Brian Kennedy and Sara Clancy, a Charlotte Church
sound-alike _ fail to do much with the soupy cliches of their
songs. ``Riverdance on Broadway'' also includes some dreadful stuff
billed as flamenco, performed by Maria Pages. And the show looks as
if it is unfolding in an olde-Irish parking garage.
</P>
<P>
   But there will always be, it seems, a ``Riverdance.'' This one,
directed by John McColgan with music and lyrics by Bill Whelan,
plays through June 25 at the Gershwin Theater.

Matrix,'' blending science fiction, martial arts and action
inspired by Hong Kong films; David O. Russell did it with ``Three
Kings,'' merging ``The Treasure of Sierra Madre,'' ``Gunga Din''
and ``MASH'' and tossing them into a Persian Gulf War story. Now

from Fox and the WB's teen shows not starred in one of these things
yet? Not that that slowed down the producers of ``Final

story line is as serpentine and unpredictable as a well-devised
plot. And the book is written by a true insider, Robert Smith,

<P>
   GUADALUPE VALLEY, Mexico _ As Victor Torres swished the amber
liquid between his teeth, an expression of joy spread over his
face.
</P>
<P>
   A French-trained winemaker, Torres knew he had a sweet nectar of
exquisite caliber in the making.
</P>
<P>
   Are we talking France here? Maybe Napa Valley?
</P>
<P>
   Neither. Torres is among a new breed of winemakers in the
Guadalupe Valley, a pocket of surprisingly fertile land on the
Pacific Ocean side of Mexico's Baja California. The valley is only
about 50 miles southeast of the border city of San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Blessed by a cooling coastal fog that takes the hot edge off the
region's near-desert terrain, the valley is starting to produce
award-winning wines that are gaining a toehold at upscale
restaurants and among wine lovers on both sides of the border.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could be the Napa Valley of Mexico,'' said Torres, the
winemaker for Chateau Camou, one of about a half-dozen wineries
that have started to produce premiere wines in the valley over the
last decade.
</P>
<P>
   Just down the road from Chateau Camou, winemaker Hans Backhoff,
who grew up in this area, also praises the soil, sun and chilly
nights that create a nourishing micro-climate for grapes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the influence of the sea. That's what makes this valley
so special,'' Backhoff said, as he poured a sample of Merlot aging
in a French oak barrel at his winery, Monte Xanic (pronounced,
``Mon-TAY Sha-NEEK'').
</P>
<P>
   Mexicans consume less than half a bottle of wine per person per
year, a figure that's a fraction of what consumers drink in
countries that have a love affair with the grape. Argentineans, for
example, consume around 50 liters per person annually.
</P>
<P>
   Mexicans still produce far more of the ever-popular tequila and
beer. But wine consumption is indeed increasing, buoyed by a taste
for fine wine among Mexican professionals and Baja's homegrown
industry.
</P>
<P>
   The Guadalupe Valley is about 10 miles east of the Baja beach
town of Ensenada, which is touting Mexico's new ``wine country'' as
a great place to visit while eating lobster enchiladas and swimming
and surfing. Hotels are stocking fliers on the Guadalupe Valley
now, and offering tours for tasting and to attend a number of
annual festivals. Cruise ships that dock in Ensenada are also
encouraging visitors. The valley's wines are featured now in fine
restaurants in Acapulco, Cancun, Mexico City and a growing number
of American cities.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the oldest winery in this hemisphere started in
Mexico, where in the 1520s Mexico's Spanish conquistadors ordered
1,000 vines planted for every 100 Indians forced to work for them.
</P>
<P>
   Then Spain, fearing competition from its colony, subsequently
banned vineyards from Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Wine grapes were eventually born again in Mexico, but for
centuries vintners have produced mostly grapes for brandy or for
wine that was mediocre.
</P>
<P>
   Now vintners in Baja California, where most of Mexico's wine
grapes are grown, are getting serious about quality rather than
quantity.
</P>
<P>
   That's the mission of the Guadalupe Valley vintners, including
the oldest of the bunch, Bodegas de Santo Tomas, which was
established in 1888.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 Santo Tomas winemakers teamed up with American friends
in Northern California, a region that was also once considered an
upstart in a world of wines dominated by Europeans. The joint
venture, which first produced 5,000 cases that were released in
1998, was the brainchild of Santo Tomas and Wente Bros., a
century-old winery in the Livermore Valley east of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Christened Duetto, the wine is a blend of 50 percent Mexican and
50 percent California grapes. It is bottled in Mexico, and thus
escapes tariffs on U.S. wine imports that are hovering at about 8
percent now. A high-quality red wine mix of Cabernet Sauvignon,
Cabernet Franc and Merlot, Duetto's first vintage sold out in a
month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mexico has the quality of the grapes. They have everything to
produce a good wine. That's for sure,'' said Marc Bourreli, Wente's
director of Latin American exports.
</P>
<P>
   This year, for the first time, 1,000 cases of Duetto will be
released in the U.S. market for retail sale and stocking at
restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Torres and Backhoff's wines are also heading north.
</P>
<P>
   Backhoff, a British-trained food scientist, said he made wine as
a hobby in Baja California before getting together a group of
investors in 1987 and opening up Monte Xanic. Housed in a classic
stone building, the winery has a tasting room featuring white and
red wines that are now on wine lists in restaurants in New York,
Colorado, Arizona, California and Florida. Backhoff's wines have
picked up awards at a number of California festivals in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
   The Henry Wine Group is distributing Monte Xanic now to
retailers and the Napa Valley-based Chalone Wine Group is offering
bottles of the wine to its shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Backhoff said he and his partners thought of the name of their
winery after spring rains prompted beautiful desert flowers to
bloom throughout the valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't want a French name,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So they chose Xanic, which in an Indian language means ``the
first flower that blooms after the rain,'' Backhoff said. ``It's
Mexican. But it doesn't sound like tequila or tacos.''
</P>
<P>
   The vineyard is 175 acres, he added, and some of the vines are
40 years old. Part of the vineyard was previously owned by a family
of Russian descent, which took up grape growing like other Russian
immigrants to Baja California at the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
   Xanic's wines range from US$15 to US$100. Only about 3 percent
of the product is exported, but Backhoff expects exports to climb
to 6 percent this year. Tariffs are low on Mexican wine imports to
the United States and if Mexican vintners export their wines, they
get a substantial tax break at home.
</P>
<P>
   Chateau Camou's wines are being carried by the United States'
Wine Warehouse and can be found in Chicago, Washington and this
year, the company hopes, Texas. Prices range from US$6 to more than
US$100 for wines that have won awards in French competitions in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The winery, which was founded in 1985, is constructing a new
mission-style building and its tasting room is also open for
tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Torres said he is particularly proud of his white wines _
Chardonnay and Chenin Blanc _ which many experts believe Mexican
soil simply cannot produce.
</P>
<P>
   One of Torres' white wine blends, Flor de Guadalupe, recently
beat California whites in a competition north of the border, Torres
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that was one of our lower-end wines,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Torres is equally proud of the French techniques he uses, such
as gently agitating the wine periodically with a stick while it
ferments in French oak barrels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why change something that's worked for more than 200 years?''
Torres said. ``We're trying to combine tradition with modern
techniques.''

 &HT;    PAPAL VISIT TO HOLY LAND A PERSONAL PILGRIMAGE WITH GLOBAL

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Pope John Paul II comes to the Holy Land next week
as an elderly pilgrim determined to change the world.
</P>
<P>
   He begins his visit Monday in Jordan, then visits Israel and the
Palestinian territories until the following Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   He will see the Mount Nebo in Jordan, where Moses looked upon
the promised land. He will pray above the Bethlehem cave where
tradition says Christ was born. He will deliver mass above the Sea
of Galilee, in the hills where Christ gave the speeches that became
known as the Sermon on the Mount.
</P>
<P>
   The journey presents a monumental moment in the already
remarkable life of this pontiff.
</P>
<P>
   Pope John Paul II, at 79 years of age, is the most media savvy
and well-traveled of all the popes. He scores high in U.S. public
opinion polls despite stands on issues with which many Americans
disagree _ against abortion, the death penalty and contraception.
</P>
<P>
   Long ago an amateur actor, the pope now steps onto a stage that
has the most holy sites in Christianity as its backdrop _ in the
very places Christ himself walked. It is his first trip here as
pope.
</P>
<P>
   With the pope in the twilight years of his pontificate, this
91st trip abroad could be the hallmark of a legacy that is hinged
on the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   The pope has declared the year 2000 a ``Jubilee'' and ``Holy
Year.'' He asks that Catholics begin the third millennium since
Christ's birth by reflecting on their past, and building a new
future.
</P>
<P>
   Last Sunday, the first of the Catholic Lenten period of
penitence, the pope took the unprecedented step of asking
forgiveness from God for a sweeping list of sins committed by
followers of the church.
</P>
<P>
   This week's trip is part of that renewal or, as the pope calls
it, the ``purification of memory.'' Ultimately, he aims for nothing
less than sweeping away centuries of bitterness between Jews and
Catholics _ and within different branches of Christianity itself.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere are the divisions more clear than here. Israelis and
Palestinians are still logjammed in a tense peace process. Arab
Christians _ some 180,000 of them _ are an uncomfortable minority
between the Jewish state and Muslim-dominated areas under control
of the Palestinian Authority.
</P>
<P>
   Some Jews accuse the Church of ignoring the Holocaust. Some
Muslims bear grudges from the Church's medieval crusades. Greek
Orthodox Christians here view the Catholic Church with suspicion.
</P>
<P>
   Amid it all, the pope brings his message of reconciliation with
the hopeful enthusiasm of a pilgrim.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a strong desire to go personally to pray in the most
important places which, from the Old to the New Testament, have
seen God's interventions,'' the pope wrote in June of last year.
``I say to everyone: Let us set out in the footsteps of Christ!''
</P>
<P>
   He came here in 1965, before he was pope, and commemorated the
``unforgettable experience'' in poetry.
</P>
<P>
   Some say it took the warming relations between Israel and its
Arab neighbors to make the new trip possible. Others protest that
the time is still not right, since many issues between Israelis and
Palestinians remain unresolved.
</P>
<P>
   But, the pope has talked about the Jubilee year since he
ascended to the papacy in 1978. Now appearing to suffer from
Parkinson's disease, it may be that no political circumstance could
have stopped him from making the trip _ which he insists is not
political.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be an exclusively religious pilgrimage in its nature
and purpose, and I would be saddened if anyone were to attach other
meanings to this plan of mine,'' he wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   But politics are super-imposed on any high-profile trip to the
region, and the pope's is no exception.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians worry his visits to Arab areas of east Jerusalem _
under Israeli security protection _ will be seen as a recognition
of Israeli occupation there. Israelis fear his trip to
Palestinian-controlled areas will be tantamount to a recognition of
Palestinian statehood.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is inevitable that it is going to be politicized. What will
please the Palestinians will upset the Israelis, and whatever
pleases the Israelis will upset the Palestinians,'' said Harry
Hagopian, executive director of the Jerusalem liaison office for
the Middle East Council of Churches.
</P>
<P>
   But Archbishop Pietro Sambi, the Vatican's representative to
Israel, suggested the pope's visit could ease the political
bitterness.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the pope speaks of a spiritual pilgrimage, he is not
talking about just coming to say prayers,'' Sambi said. ``He means
to make a new consensus, a sense of responsibility, a principle of
truth and justice.''
</P>
<P>
   The ground is more fertile for that than it was during the only
other papal visit to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   In 1964, Pope Paul VI visited for a day. Relations were so
chilly between the Vatican and Israel that he insisted on a special
entry point into the country rather than recognize any of Israel's
official border points.
</P>
<P>
   In those days, Israeli officials still bristled at the Church's
silence during the Holocaust. Church doctrine seemed to blame Jews
for the death of Christ.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Church officials were sympathetic to Israel's Arab
neighbors. They worried that cozy relations with Israel would
endanger Christian communities in Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1960s, the church officially retracted the
accusations of Jewish involvement in Christ's death. Then, Pope
John Paul II went even further.
</P>
<P>
   He has sought forgiveness for Catholics' misdeeds during the
Holocaust and has condemned anti-Semitism dozens of times. While
church teachings used to call the Jews treacherous, this pope has
dubbed Judaism the ``elder brother'' among the Christian, Jewish
and Muslim faiths.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi David Rosen, head of the Israel office of the
Anti-Defamation League, said the pope has ``turned upside down the
whole traditional attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, with the way paved by the Oslo peace process, Israel
and the Vatican exchanged their first ambassadors.
</P>
<P>
   Of primary concern to the Vatican are the followers of the pope
in the region. There are about 70,000 Arab Christians in Israel and
the Palestinian areas who are Roman Catholics or Greek Catholics,
known also as Melkites.
</P>
<P>
   They comprise a little less than half the Christians in Israel
and the Palestinian areas _ including Greek, Syrian, Armenian
Orthodox and some Protestants. They have been overwhelmed by the
growth in the Jewish and Muslim populations.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty years ago, Christians made up about 9 percent of the
population, but now they are about 2 percent. Christians emigrate
at higher rates than non-Christians do.
</P>
<P>
   The pope is expected to encourage the local Christians to stay
in the place where Christianity began.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe he will have special blessings,'' said 77-year-old
Labibeh Abdel-Noor, leaving a Roman Catholic Mass in Jerusalem's
Church of the Holy Sepulchre on Sunday. The pope is scheduled to
hold a Mass in the church, believed by Catholics to be where Christ
was crucified and entombed, on March 26.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-five years ago, Abdel-Noor was among the crowds that
greeted Paul VI. Just maybe, she said, this pope's visit can bring
people closer.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people can start to get united, it is easier to have
peace. We pray for peace,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But, the pope's message could be less well-received by those of
the majority religions.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli officials welcome the visit and say it will be a
breakthrough in Christian-Jewish relations. They have laid out more
than $10 million in roadwork and construction for the visit.
</P>
<P>
   A poll this month showed most Israelis see the visit positively.
</P>
<P>
   But, a fringe of right-wing Israelis have threatened to disrupt
the visit if they can. Signs and graffiti in Jerusalem have labeled
the pope a ``pagan'' who should be shunned.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Chief Rabbi Israel Meir Lau said he hopes the pope will
use a visit to the Yad Vashem Holocaust museum to apologize for the
silence of Pope Pius XII during the Holocaust. He said the pope's
Lenten confession of sins, which did not mention the Holocaust,
showed ``serious historical myopia.''
</P>
<P>
   An apology for Pius XII is extremely unlikely. He is in the
running for sainthood and popes are considered infallible under
Catholic doctrine.
</P>
<P>
   But, the pope has asked for 15 minutes to speak at Yad Vashem
and is using the event to meet Jews from his hometown in Poland who
fled the Holocaust. Some were among the pope's childhood friends.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, officials of the Palestinian Authority _ which
controls the Palestinian areas _ have warmly welcomed the visit,
while some Muslims chose to bear their own grudges. One Muslim
leader called for the pope to apologize for the Crusades.
</P>
<P>
   For most of his trip, the pope will be surrounded by 18,000
police in the largest security operation in Israeli history. Entire
neighborhoods will be closed when the pope is nearby, prompting
concerns that the isolation will frustrate local Christians and
deprive the pope of the crowd contact from which he draws strength.
</P>
<P>
   Two of his ``Pope Mobiles'' are being flown in and a smaller one
has been constructed to navigate the narrow streets of Jerusalem's
Old City. He will spend his nights in the house of the Vatican
delegation here, an old mansion with Arab tile floors and a small
chapel. A helicopter pad was built nearby.
</P>
<P>
   The pope's itinerary includes time alone at Holy sites for
meditation. He will also give a Mass before about 100,000 near the
Sea of Galilee, and another to an expected 7,000 in Bethlehem.
</P>
<P>
   The pope is also visiting the Holocaust museum and a Palestinian
refugee camp _ two sites that are not destinations for religious
pilgrimage. They are his nod to the trip's tense political
backdrop, where he can show sympathy for suffering on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's trying to present a model for how you go about
reconciliation,'' said the Rev. Drew Christiansen, a Jesuit advisor
for international affairs to the United States Catholic Conference.
``It's a moment of grace and, God willing, everyone will be open to
the grace _ wherever they stand.''

   MOSCOW _ Nadia Gorovaya is a 19-year-old Russian architecture
student who counts The Verve and The Beatles among her favorite
musical groups. She loves art, and spends free time hanging out
with friends in Moscow's budding cafe culture. She and her mother
live in a tidy one-bedroom apartment on this city's northern
outskirts. On March 26, Nadia will be able to cast a vote for the
first time choosing the person who will lead Russia for the next
four years. She spoke recently with Cox Newspapers Moscow
correspondent Margaret Coker on her thoughts about politics and
teen-age life in her country.
</P>
<P>
   ------------------------------------------------------------------
</P>
<P>
   Question: Your generation is the first to come of age after the
Cold War. How are you and your friends different from your parents?
</P>
<P>
   Answer: We are very different. Me and my friends have a much
wider outlook and have access to much more information. We also
have more responsibility and more choice. Previously, (your life)
was more or less pre-determined. You graduated and knew what was in
store for you. You did what was required. Now, even though life is
rather hard, more depends on the person's own effort.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How is your view of America and the rest of the world
different?
</P>
<P>
   A: The borders are now open and many of my friends and I travel
a lot. It's one of the things I like most. I get a fresh look at
things and new impressions. (This opportunity) is much more
realistic for us than it was for our parents.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What do you think are the best, and the worst changes in your
country since the end of the Soviet Union?
</P>
<P>
   A: To me, the best thing is democracy, the ability to say what
you think freely even if the government doesn't like what you say.
Now, we have some freedom of choice. The worst thing is that all of
this is not yet properly protected. Our laws don't really work all
of the time.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Would your older relatives answer this question the same way?
</P>
<P>
   A: In principle, they all agree with me. Although my father, for
example, who belongs to the democratic camp and does not want the
restoration of the old regime, believes there were some advantages
in the Soviet times, like free education and free health-care.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What do you think about the political situation in Russia?
</P>
<P>
   A: I do not like what is happening now. I think the authorities
are thinking for the most part about power, money, prestige and
very little about what they ought to be thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What do you think your leaders should be paying attention to?
</P>
<P>
   A: In the first place, to social programs, raising people's
living standards because the majority of the population are very
poor. The government must develop the economy, private business,
promote private property.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you discuss politics with your friends?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, with some. Not of all my friends are interested. I've
found they usually share the views of their parents. In these
elections, I think many of my friends are going to vote like their
parents
</P>
<P>
   Q: For whom will you vote?
</P>
<P>
   A: For Gregory Yavlinsky (the leader of the liberal political
party Yabloko).
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why?
</P>
<P>
   A: I think he is the most democratic candidate. His party, I
think, is the most honest and the most decent. His program is aimed
at the development of all of Russia, especially promoting private
property. There are so many issues I like. For example, Yavlinsky
opposes the war in Chechnya and says it should be stopped.
Unfortunately, I know he will lose. There is no alternative to
Putin in these elections, but I do not want to vote for him.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If you think the winner is obvious, then why bother voting at
all?
</P>
<P>
   A: If I do not go to the polls, my ballot may be used somehow to
falsify the results. It is my choice. I do not want to vote for
someone else only because everybody else votes for him. I do not
want this to happen. There will be few of us voting for Yabloko,
but maybe it will give rise to the hope of this happening in
future.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where did you first learn about democracy?
</P>
<P>
   A: We studied it a bit in history class in high school, but, of
course, it is not enough. We studied the American system some. I
read books for myself to find out what the principles are.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You have visited America. Did you like our way of life? Do
you think it is better?
</P>
<P>
   A: You have a higher standard of living compared to Russia. Of
course, that is better. Your college graduates know they will be
able to find a job. It is hard for U.S. families to pay for
education, but at least you have a banking and loan system that
makes it possible to repay all costs. Americans can travel, change
jobs, feel the police protects them. Your courts are really
unbiased in most cases.
</P>
<P>
   My friends really like America. They think everything is great
there. But I think there are negative things about your country,
too. People pay too much attention to superficial things, not to
culture or the soul. You can find anything in the stores, sometimes
even 100 kinds of soap. But what about theater or good books?
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you follow the news? Read newspapers?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, I do. Not very regularly, but I do.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you know about the American elections?
</P>
<P>
   A: That you have now two candidates _ Democrat Al Gore and
Republican George Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If you were an American for whom would you vote?
</P>
<P>
   A: I know less about American politics ... Not that I do not
care at all, but I know much less about your candidates than mine.
I don't know who I would vote for, honestly. I think Democrats, as
a party, are closer to my views.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How do you see your life in five years?
</P>
<P>
   A: I do not know. What makes life in Russia both fascinating and
a little frightening is that you do not know what's in store for
you tomorrow. You do not know what life is going to be like in one
or two years, let alone in five. I do hope it will get better. In
principle, I am an optimist. But judging by what is happening now,
I'm not sure. If Putin comes to power it will be a regime based on
a ``strong hand.'' I do not think he'll bring about more reforms.

<P>
   GUADALUPE VALLEY, Mexico _ As Victor Torres swished the amber
liquid between his teeth, an expression of joy spread over his
face.
</P>
<P>
   A French-trained winemaker, Torres knew he had a sweet nectar of
exquisite caliber in the making.
</P>
<P>
   Are we talking France here? Maybe Napa Valley?
</P>
<P>
   Neither. Torres is among a new breed of winemakers in the
Guadalupe Valley, a pocket of surprisingly fertile land on the
Pacific Ocean side of Mexico's Baja California. The valley is only
about 50 miles southeast of the border city of San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Blessed by a cooling coastal fog that takes the hot edge off the
region's near-desert terrain, the valley is starting to produce
award-winning wines that are gaining a toehold at upscale
restaurants and among wine lovers on both sides of the border.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could be the Napa Valley of Mexico,'' said Torres, the
winemaker for Chateau Camou, one of about a half-dozen wineries
that have started to produce premiere wines in the valley over the
last decade.
</P>
<P>
   Just down the road from Chateau Camou, winemaker Hans Backhoff,
who grew up in this area, also praises the soil, sun and chilly
nights that create a nourishing micro-climate for grapes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the influence of the sea. That's what makes this valley
so special,'' Backhoff said, as he poured a sample of Merlot aging
in a French oak barrel at his winery, Monte Xanic (pronounced,
``Mon-TAY Sha-NEEK'').
</P>
<P>
   Mexicans consume less than half a bottle of wine per person per
year, a figure that's a fraction of what consumers drink in
countries that have a love affair with the grape. Argentineans, for
example, consume around 50 liters per person annually.
</P>
<P>
   Mexicans still produce far more of the ever-popular tequila and
beer. But wine consumption is indeed increasing, buoyed by a taste
for fine wine among Mexican professionals and Baja's homegrown
industry.
</P>
<P>
   The Guadalupe Valley is about 10 miles east of the Baja beach
town of Ensenada, which is touting Mexico's new ``wine country'' as
a great place to visit while eating lobster enchiladas and swimming
and surfing. Hotels are stocking fliers on the Guadalupe Valley
now, and offering tours for tasting and to attend a number of
annual festivals. Cruise ships that dock in Ensenada are also
encouraging visitors. The valley's wines are featured now in fine
restaurants in Acapulco, Cancun, Mexico City and a growing number
of American cities.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the oldest winery in this hemisphere started in
Mexico, where in the 1520s Mexico's Spanish conquistadors ordered
1,000 vines planted for every 100 Indians forced to work for them.
</P>
<P>
   Then Spain, fearing competition from its colony, subsequently
banned vineyards from Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Wine grapes were eventually born again in Mexico, but for
centuries vintners have produced mostly grapes for brandy or for
wine that was mediocre.
</P>
<P>
   Now vintners in Baja California, where most of Mexico's wine
grapes are grown, are getting serious about quality rather than
quantity.
</P>
<P>
   That's the mission of the Guadalupe Valley vintners, including
the oldest of the bunch, Bodegas de Santo Tomas, which was
established in 1888.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 Santo Tomas winemakers teamed up with American friends
in Northern California, a region that was also once considered an
upstart in a world of wines dominated by Europeans. The joint
venture, which first produced 5,000 cases that were released in
1998, was the brainchild of Santo Tomas and Wente Bros., a
century-old winery in the Livermore Valley east of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Christened Duetto, the wine is a blend of 50 percent Mexican and
50 percent California grapes. It is bottled in Mexico, and thus
escapes tariffs on U.S. wine imports that are hovering at about 8
percent now. A high-quality red wine mix of Cabernet Sauvignon,
Cabernet Franc and Merlot, Duetto's first vintage sold out in a
month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mexico has the quality of the grapes. They have everything to
produce a good wine. That's for sure,'' said Marc Bourreli, Wente's
director of Latin American exports.
</P>
<P>
   This year, for the first time, 1,000 cases of Duetto will be
released in the U.S. market for retail sale and stocking at
restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Torres and Backhoff's wines are also heading north.
</P>
<P>
   Backhoff, a British-trained food scientist, said he made wine as
a hobby in Baja California before getting together a group of
investors in 1987 and opening up Monte Xanic. Housed in a classic
stone building, the winery has a tasting room featuring white and
red wines that are now on wine lists in restaurants in New York,
Colorado, Arizona, California and Florida. Backhoff's wines have
picked up awards at a number of California festivals in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
   The Henry Wine Group is distributing Monte Xanic now to
retailers and the Napa Valley-based Chalone Wine Group is offering
bottles of the wine to its shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Backhoff said he and his partners thought of the name of their
winery after spring rains prompted beautiful desert flowers to
bloom throughout the valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't want a French name,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So they chose Xanic, which in an Indian language means ``the
first flower that blooms after the rain,'' Backhoff said. ``It's
Mexican. But it doesn't sound like tequila or tacos.''
</P>
<P>
   The vineyard is 175 acres, he added, and some of the vines are
40 years old. Part of the vineyard was previously owned by a family
of Russian descent, which took up grape growing like other Russian
immigrants to Baja California at the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
   Xanic's wines range from US$15 to US$100. Only about 3 percent
of the product is exported, but Backhoff expects exports to climb
to 6 percent this year. Tariffs are low on Mexican wine imports to
the United States and if Mexican vintners export their wines, they
get a substantial tax break at home.
</P>
<P>
   Chateau Camou's wines are being carried by the United States'
Wine Warehouse and can be found in Chicago, Washington and this
year, the company hopes, Texas. Prices range from US$6 to more than
US$100 for wines that have won awards in French competitions in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The winery, which was founded in 1985, is constructing a new
mission-style building and its tasting room is also open for
tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Torres said he is particularly proud of his white wines _
Chardonnay and Chenin Blanc _ which many experts believe Mexican
soil simply cannot produce.
</P>
<P>
   One of Torres' white wine blends, Flor de Guadalupe, recently
beat California whites in a competition north of the border, Torres
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that was one of our lower-end wines,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Torres is equally proud of the French techniques he uses, such
as gently agitating the wine periodically with a stick while it
ferments in French oak barrels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why change something that's worked for more than 200 years?''
Torres said. ``We're trying to combine tradition with modern
techniques.''

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Pope John Paul II comes to the Holy Land next week
as an elderly pilgrim determined to change the world.
</P>
<P>
   He begins his visit Monday in Jordan, then visits Israel and the
Palestinian territories until the following Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   He will see the Mount Nebo in Jordan, where Moses looked upon
the promised land. He will pray above the Bethlehem cave where
tradition says Christ was born. He will deliver mass above the Sea
of Galilee, in the hills where Christ gave the speeches that became
known as the Sermon on the Mount.
</P>
<P>
   The journey presents a monumental moment in the already
remarkable life of this pontiff.
</P>
<P>
   Pope John Paul II, at 79 years of age, is the most media savvy
and well-traveled of all the popes. He scores high in U.S. public
opinion polls despite stands on issues with which many Americans
disagree _ against abortion, the death penalty and contraception.
</P>
<P>
   Long ago an amateur actor, the pope now steps onto a stage that
has the most holy sites in Christianity as its backdrop _ in the
very places Christ himself walked. It is his first trip here as
pope.
</P>
<P>
   With the pope in the twilight years of his pontificate, this
91st trip abroad could be the hallmark of a legacy that is hinged
on the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   The pope has declared the year 2000 a ``Jubilee'' and ``Holy
Year.'' He asks that Catholics begin the third millennium since
Christ's birth by reflecting on their past, and building a new
future.
</P>
<P>
   Last Sunday, the first of the Catholic Lenten period of
penitence, the pope took the unprecedented step of asking
forgiveness from God for a sweeping list of sins committed by
followers of the church.
</P>
<P>
   This week's trip is part of that renewal or, as the pope calls
it, the ``purification of memory.'' Ultimately, he aims for nothing
less than sweeping away centuries of bitterness between Jews and
Catholics _ and within different branches of Christianity itself.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere are the divisions more clear than here. Israelis and
Palestinians are still logjammed in a tense peace process. Arab
Christians _ some 180,000 of them _ are an uncomfortable minority
between the Jewish state and Muslim-dominated areas under control
of the Palestinian Authority.
</P>
<P>
   Some Jews accuse the Church of ignoring the Holocaust. Some
Muslims bear grudges from the Church's medieval crusades. Greek
Orthodox Christians here view the Catholic Church with suspicion.
</P>
<P>
   Amid it all, the pope brings his message of reconciliation with
the hopeful enthusiasm of a pilgrim.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a strong desire to go personally to pray in the most
important places which, from the Old to the New Testament, have
seen God's interventions,'' the pope wrote in June of last year.
``I say to everyone: Let us set out in the footsteps of Christ!''
</P>
<P>
   He came here in 1965, before he was pope, and commemorated the
``unforgettable experience'' in poetry.
</P>
<P>
   Some say it took the warming relations between Israel and its
Arab neighbors to make the new trip possible. Others protest that
the time is still not right, since many issues between Israelis and
Palestinians remain unresolved.
</P>
<P>
   But, the pope has talked about the Jubilee year since he
ascended to the papacy in 1978. Now appearing to suffer from
Parkinson's disease, it may be that no political circumstance could
have stopped him from making the trip _ which he insists is not
political.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be an exclusively religious pilgrimage in its nature
and purpose, and I would be saddened if anyone were to attach other
meanings to this plan of mine,'' he wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   But politics are super-imposed on any high-profile trip to the
region, and the pope's is no exception.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians worry his visits to Arab areas of east Jerusalem _
under Israeli security protection _ will be seen as a recognition
of Israeli occupation there. Israelis fear his trip to
Palestinian-controlled areas will be tantamount to a recognition of
Palestinian statehood.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is inevitable that it is going to be politicized. What will
please the Palestinians will upset the Israelis, and whatever
pleases the Israelis will upset the Palestinians,'' said Harry
Hagopian, executive director of the Jerusalem liaison office for
the Middle East Council of Churches.
</P>
<P>
   But Archbishop Pietro Sambi, the Vatican's representative to
Israel, suggested the pope's visit could ease the political
bitterness.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the pope speaks of a spiritual pilgrimage, he is not
talking about just coming to say prayers,'' Sambi said. ``He means
to make a new consensus, a sense of responsibility, a principle of
truth and justice.''
</P>
<P>
   The ground is more fertile for that than it was during the only
other papal visit to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   In 1964, Pope Paul VI visited for a day. Relations were so
chilly between the Vatican and Israel that he insisted on a special
entry point into the country rather than recognize any of Israel's
official border points.
</P>
<P>
   In those days, Israeli officials still bristled at the Church's
silence during the Holocaust. Church doctrine seemed to blame Jews
for the death of Christ.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Church officials were sympathetic to Israel's Arab
neighbors. They worried that cozy relations with Israel would
endanger Christian communities in Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1960s, the church officially retracted the
accusations of Jewish involvement in Christ's death. Then, Pope
John Paul II went even further.
</P>
<P>
   He has sought forgiveness for Catholics' misdeeds during the
Holocaust and has condemned anti-Semitism dozens of times. While
church teachings used to call the Jews treacherous, this pope has
dubbed Judaism the ``elder brother'' among the Christian, Jewish
and Muslim faiths.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi David Rosen, head of the Israel office of the
Anti-Defamation League, said the pope has ``turned upside down the
whole traditional attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, with the way paved by the Oslo peace process, Israel
and the Vatican exchanged their first ambassadors.
</P>
<P>
   Of primary concern to the Vatican are the followers of the pope
in the region. There are about 70,000 Arab Christians in Israel and
the Palestinian areas who are Roman Catholics or Greek Catholics,
known also as Melkites.
</P>
<P>
   They comprise a little less than half the Christians in Israel
and the Palestinian areas _ including Greek, Syrian, Armenian
Orthodox and some Protestants. They have been overwhelmed by the
growth in the Jewish and Muslim populations.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty years ago, Christians made up about 9 percent of the
population, but now they are about 2 percent. Christians emigrate
at higher rates than non-Christians do.
</P>
<P>
   The pope is expected to encourage the local Christians to stay
in the place where Christianity began.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe he will have special blessings,'' said 77-year-old
Labibeh Abdel-Noor, leaving a Roman Catholic Mass in Jerusalem's
Church of the Holy Sepulchre on Sunday. The pope is scheduled to
hold a Mass in the church, believed by Catholics to be where Christ
was crucified and entombed, on March 26.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-five years ago, Abdel-Noor was among the crowds that
greeted Paul VI. Just maybe, she said, this pope's visit can bring
people closer.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people can start to get united, it is easier to have
peace. We pray for peace,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But, the pope's message could be less well-received by those of
the majority religions.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli officials welcome the visit and say it will be a
breakthrough in Christian-Jewish relations. They have laid out more
than $10 million in roadwork and construction for the visit.
</P>
<P>
   A poll this month showed most Israelis see the visit positively.
</P>
<P>
   But, a fringe of right-wing Israelis have threatened to disrupt
the visit if they can. Signs and graffiti in Jerusalem have labeled
the pope a ``pagan'' who should be shunned.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Chief Rabbi Israel Meir Lau said he hopes the pope will
use a visit to the Yad Vashem Holocaust museum to apologize for the
silence of Pope Pius XII during the Holocaust. He said the pope's
Lenten confession of sins, which did not mention the Holocaust,
showed ``serious historical myopia.''
</P>
<P>
   An apology for Pius XII is extremely unlikely. He is in the
running for sainthood and popes are considered infallible under
Catholic doctrine.
</P>
<P>
   But, the pope has asked for 15 minutes to speak at Yad Vashem
and is using the event to meet Jews from his hometown in Poland who
fled the Holocaust. Some were among the pope's childhood friends.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, officials of the Palestinian Authority _ which
controls the Palestinian areas _ have warmly welcomed the visit,
while some Muslims chose to bear their own grudges. One Muslim
leader called for the pope to apologize for the Crusades.
</P>
<P>
   For most of his trip, the pope will be surrounded by 18,000
police in the largest security operation in Israeli history. Entire
neighborhoods will be closed when the pope is nearby, prompting
concerns that the isolation will frustrate local Christians and
deprive the pope of the crowd contact from which he draws strength.
</P>
<P>
   Two of his ``Pope Mobiles'' are being flown in and a smaller one
has been constructed to navigate the narrow streets of Jerusalem's
Old City. He will spend his nights in the house of the Vatican
delegation here, an old mansion with Arab tile floors and a small
chapel. A helicopter pad was built nearby.
</P>
<P>
   The pope's itinerary includes time alone at Holy sites for
meditation. He will also give a Mass before about 100,000 near the
Sea of Galilee, and another to an expected 7,000 in Bethlehem.
</P>
<P>
   The pope is also visiting the Holocaust museum and a Palestinian
refugee camp _ two sites that are not destinations for religious
pilgrimage. They are his nod to the trip's tense political
backdrop, where he can show sympathy for suffering on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's trying to present a model for how you go about
reconciliation,'' said the Rev. Drew Christiansen, a Jesuit advisor
for international affairs to the United States Catholic Conference.
``It's a moment of grace and, God willing, everyone will be open to
the grace _ wherever they stand.''
</P>

   MOSCOW _ Nadia Gorovaya is a 19-year-old Russian architecture
student who counts The Verve and The Beatles among her favorite
musical groups. She loves art, and spends free time hanging out
with friends in Moscow's budding cafe culture. She and her mother
live in a tidy one-bedroom apartment on this city's northern
outskirts. On March 26, Nadia will be able to cast a vote for the
first time choosing the person who will lead Russia for the next
four years. She spoke recently with Cox Newspapers Moscow
correspondent Margaret Coker on her thoughts about politics and
teen-age life in her country.
</P>
<P>
   ------------------------------------------------------------------
</P>
<P>
   Question: Your generation is the first to come of age after the
Cold War. How are you and your friends different from your parents?
</P>
<P>
   Answer: We are very different. Me and my friends have a much
wider outlook and have access to much more information. We also
have more responsibility and more choice. Previously, (your life)
was more or less pre-determined. You graduated and knew what was in
store for you. You did what was required. Now, even though life is
rather hard, more depends on the person's own effort.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How is your view of America and the rest of the world
different?
</P>
<P>
   A: The borders are now open and many of my friends and I travel
a lot. It's one of the things I like most. I get a fresh look at
things and new impressions. (This opportunity) is much more
realistic for us than it was for our parents.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What do you think are the best, and the worst changes in your
country since the end of the Soviet Union?
</P>
<P>
   A: To me, the best thing is democracy, the ability to say what
you think freely even if the government doesn't like what you say.
Now, we have some freedom of choice. The worst thing is that all of
this is not yet properly protected. Our laws don't really work all
of the time.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Would your older relatives answer this question the same way?
</P>
<P>
   A: In principle, they all agree with me. Although my father, for
example, who belongs to the democratic camp and does not want the
restoration of the old regime, believes there were some advantages
in the Soviet times, like free education and free health-care.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What do you think about the political situation in Russia?
</P>
<P>
   A: I do not like what is happening now. I think the authorities
are thinking for the most part about power, money, prestige and
very little about what they ought to be thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What do you think your leaders should be paying attention to?
</P>
<P>
   A: In the first place, to social programs, raising people's
living standards because the majority of the population are very
poor. The government must develop the economy, private business,
promote private property.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you discuss politics with your friends?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, with some. Not of all my friends are interested. I've
found they usually share the views of their parents. In these
elections, I think many of my friends are going to vote like their
parents
</P>
<P>
   Q: For whom will you vote?
</P>
<P>
   A: For Gregory Yavlinsky (the leader of the liberal political
party Yabloko).
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why?
</P>
<P>
   A: I think he is the most democratic candidate. His party, I
think, is the most honest and the most decent. His program is aimed
at the development of all of Russia, especially promoting private
property. There are so many issues I like. For example, Yavlinsky
opposes the war in Chechnya and says it should be stopped.
Unfortunately, I know he will lose. There is no alternative to
Putin in these elections, but I do not want to vote for him.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If you think the winner is obvious, then why bother voting at
all?
</P>
<P>
   A: If I do not go to the polls, my ballot may be used somehow to
falsify the results. It is my choice. I do not want to vote for
someone else only because everybody else votes for him. I do not
want this to happen. There will be few of us voting for Yabloko,
but maybe it will give rise to the hope of this happening in
future.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where did you first learn about democracy?
</P>
<P>
   A: We studied it a bit in history class in high school, but, of
course, it is not enough. We studied the American system some. I
read books for myself to find out what the principles are.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You have visited America. Did you like our way of life? Do
you think it is better?
</P>
<P>
   A: You have a higher standard of living compared to Russia. Of
course, that is better. Your college graduates know they will be
able to find a job. It is hard for U.S. families to pay for
education, but at least you have a banking and loan system that
makes it possible to repay all costs. Americans can travel, change
jobs, feel the police protects them. Your courts are really
unbiased in most cases.
</P>
<P>
   My friends really like America. They think everything is great
there. But I think there are negative things about your country,
too. People pay too much attention to superficial things, not to
culture or the soul. You can find anything in the stores, sometimes
even 100 kinds of soap. But what about theater or good books?
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you follow the news? Read newspapers?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, I do. Not very regularly, but I do.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you know about the American elections?
</P>
<P>
   A: That you have now two candidates _ Democrat Al Gore and
Republican George Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If you were an American for whom would you vote?
</P>
<P>
   A: I know less about American politics ... Not that I do not
care at all, but I know much less about your candidates than mine.
I don't know who I would vote for, honestly. I think Democrats, as
a party, are closer to my views.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How do you see your life in five years?
</P>
<P>
   A: I do not know. What makes life in Russia both fascinating and
a little frightening is that you do not know what's in store for
you tomorrow. You do not know what life is going to be like in one
or two years, let alone in five. I do hope it will get better. In
principle, I am an optimist. But judging by what is happening now,
I'm not sure. If Putin comes to power it will be a regime based on
a ``strong hand.'' I do not think he'll bring about more reforms.

   Once Radical, Now Recherche
</P>
<P>
   A group of contemporary artworks from what Sotheby's describes
only as a private European collection are to be auctioned May 17 in
New York at Sotheby's as part of a wider evening sale of
contemporary art. The works, dating from 1965 to 1971, range from
Minimalist sculpture and painting to Conceptual photography and
neon installations. The entire collection is expected to sell for
about $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most prized works is Bruce Nauman's ``Light Trap for
Henry Moore, No. 1'' (1967), a black-and-white photograph made by
twirling a flashlight in a darkened room and recording the glowing
spirals. It is expected to sell for $250,000 to $350,000. The
artist's catalog raisonne says it is from the collection of Angelo
Baldassarre, who is thought to be the seller of the collection.
</P>
<P>
   Like many Europeans buying art in the mid-1960s and early '70s,
the collector evidently had a taste for radical American art.
``Unlike so many Americans of that period, who were thrust into the
Vietnam War and looking for peace through art by buying Color Field
paintings or Pop Art, Europeans were championing more radical
artists,'' said Tobias Meyer, director of contemporary art for
Sotheby's worldwide. ``Their thinking was all about the future.
They were trying to forget the past.''
</P>
<P>
   What makes this collection particularly desirable, Meyer added,
is that the works were bought right after they were made and few
were ever exhibited.
</P>
<P>
   The collection includes sculptures and installation pieces by
Donald Judd, Carl Andre, Richard Serra and Dan Flavin as well as
Nauman. There are also paintings by Robert Ryman and Brice Marden
and photographs by John Baldessari.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rain Forest,'' a 1971 painting by Marden, is expected to sell
for $1.5 million to $2 million. It is a three-panel abstract work
with lush gray-green tones reminiscent of a tropical landscape. A
classic floor piece by Andre with alternating metal plates has an
estimate of $300,000 to $400,000.
</P>
<P>
   For the National Gallery
</P>
<P>
   Once a year at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, a
group that calls itself the Collectors Committee asks curators to
present works of art they feel the Gallery should have to enrich
its holdings. Led by Barney A. Ebsworth, a St. Louis collector who
is a trustee, and Doris Fisher, the San Francisco collector who is
a co-founder of the Gap clothing stores with her husband, Donald,
the group votes on what works the institution needs most.
</P>
<P>
   This year's choices were described by Earl A. Powell III, the
gallery's director, as mainstream modern.
</P>
<P>
   By far the most important is an Andy Warhol self-portrait from
1986. A large-scale silk-screen _ it measures 80 inches square _
the painting depicts the artist with his signature fright wig in
four head shots in a palette of pink and yellow. The committee
bought it from the Gagosian Gallery in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had very good early Warhols but no late ones,'' Powell
said. ``This is a particularly spectacular image.''
</P>
<P>
   The committee also gave the gallery several other works,
including a drawing by the Abstract Expressionist painter Ad
Reinhardt, a portfolio of 15 photographs published in 1974 by Garry
Winogrand and a 1966 photograph by David Lyon.
</P>
<P>
   Big Gift in Boston
</P>
<P>
   As the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston ambitiously tries
to raise $50 million _ $30 million of it for a new building on the
waterfront at Fan Pier, the first new major cultural institution to
go up in Boston in nearly 100 years _ it has received a lead gift
of $5 million from the Barbara Lee Family Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, where taste is famously conservative, Lee's gift is
among the largest ever given to an arts institution. ``For
contemporary art, it's off the charts,'' said Jill Medvedow, the
institute's director. Lee, a trustee for 10 years, is honorary
chairman of the campaign for the new building.
</P>
<P>
   Medvedow said the museum was beginning an international search
for an architect. If things proceed on schedule, the
60,000-square-foot museum should open in about four years.
</P>
<P>
   A New Sotheby's Team
</P>
<P>
   With the widening federal antitrust investigation that led to
the resignations of Sotheby's chairman, A. Alfred Taubman, and its
president and chief executive, Diana D. Brooks, the new president
and chief executive, William F. Ruprecht, is beginning to put his
team in place.
</P>
<P>
   This week the auction house announced that Warren P. Weitman,
who has been at Sotheby's since 1978 in several positions,
including head of business development and vice chairman for North
and South America, had been named chairman for North and South
America.
</P>
<P>
   Weitman replaces Richard Oldenburg, a former director of the
Museum of Modern Art in New York, who became chairman in 1995.
Oldenburg will be affiliated with Sotheby's as honorary chairman.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves one important management slot open: managing
director for Sotheby's North and South America, the job Ruprecht
held before his promotion last month. Asked when that job would be
filled, Matthew Weigman, a spokesman for Sotheby's, said, ``We
expect a management structure to be announced soon.''
</P>
<P>
   An Equitable Change
</P>
<P>
   In September, Equitable Cos. changed its name to AXA Financial
Inc. to underscore the broader range of services it has offered
clients since the Paris-based company AXA bought a controlling
interest in Equitable in 1991. So it makes sense that the Equitable
Gallery in Manhattan at 787 Seventh Ave., at 52nd Street, should
change its name, too. It will now be known as the AXA Gallery.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea to change the gallery's name evolved over time,''
said Pari Stave, its director. ``It's to show that the company as a
whole is aligned with a global brand.''

`SOFT FRUIT': UNTANGLING THE KNOTS IN FRAYING FAMILY TIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes are at end of review) 
(af) 
 By A.O. SCOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Soft Fruit'' is, in some ways, a fairly conventional story of
family dysfunction, comical at some moments, poignant at others,
full of perplexity at how people who love one another so much can
treat one another so badly, and vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   Its phylum includes movies as diverse in quality and mood as
``Parenthood,'' ``Hannah and Her Sisters,'' and ``Once Around,''
and its closest Hollywood cousin is probably Jodie Foster's ``Home
for the Holidays.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``Soft Fruit'' comes from Australia, where water runs
clockwise down the drain and where, in recent years, a distinctive
style of filmmaking, marked at once by uncompromising realism and
by breathtaking imaginative wildness, has taken hold.
</P>
<P>
   The godmother of this style is probably the New Zealander Jane
Campion, who is credited as the executive producer of ``Soft
Fruit'' and is something of a tutelary spirit as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Soft Fruit'' shares with ``Sweetie,'' Campion's 1989 study of
domestic monstrosity, as well as with such provincial antipodal
slice-of-life comic melodramas as ``Muriel's Wedding,'' a
commitment to showing human beings as they are, which is often
highly unpleasant.
</P>
<P>
   Christina Andreef, directing her first feature from her own
script, has assembled a heroically ordinary-looking cast. Her
patient camera observes them as they snore, bicker, clean their
fingernails, fold the laundry and dream.
</P>
<P>
   Genevieve Lemon, whose portrayal of the title character in
``Sweetie'' was an act of terrifying cinematic bravery, appears
here as Josie, the eldest of three sisters who have returned home
to attend to their dying mother, Patsy (Jeanie Drynan, who played
the melancholy mom in ``Muriel's Wedding'').
</P>
<P>
   Josie, who blows in from San Diego, children in tow, like the
head of a United States Marine invasion force, is bossy and
repressed. Her youngest sister, Vera (Alicia Talbot), is insecure
and depressive.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle is Nadia (Sacha Horler), a wild, impetuous
vulnerable spirit. Recently divorced, she still meets her
ex-husband for motel sex and sneaks away from her family to
masturbate in the front seat of her car, where Josie inevitably
catches her.
</P>
<P>
   Sharing what remains of the screen with these four impressively
large women _ at least three of whom are also clearly actresses of
formidable range and power _ are the men of the family: Vic (Linal
Haft), the irascible Slavic patriarch, and Bo (Russell Dykstra),
his troubled ex-convict son. Father, son and sisters, none of whom
can tolerate much of one another's company, do their best to
minister to Patsy's whims and caprices as she slowly loses vigor
and lucidity. In spare moments they bicker, fold laundry and seethe
with regret.
</P>
<P>
   The general talent and dedication of the ensemble mitigate the
script's occasional lapses into sentimentality and noisy
confrontation. Some of the characters, Vic and Josie in particular,
are too solidly grounded on a fixed set of overemphasized
attributes.
</P>
<P>
   But Haft and Lemon are performers who can draw nuances from the
air around them, and they manage to hint at undertones of
tenderness and regret beneath the dominant tones of anger and
repression.
</P>
<P>
   Dykstra and Horler, as Vic and Patsy's angry, reckless children,
give the film a needed infusion of humor and spite. ``Soft Fruit''
belongs, however, to the divine Drynan, who plays a dying,
unfulfilled, ordinary woman without embellishment or overstatement
but with mischievous reserve and surprising sensuality.
</P>
<P>
   Patsy is simultaneously dying and coming alive for the first
time. Drynan's radiance illuminates the other characters and allows
us to see them as they are: cruel, repellent, damaged, stupid and
beautiful. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `Soft Fruit' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent
or adult guardian). It includes male and female full-frontal
nudity, sexual situations, drug use and the shooting of several
innocent birds. &QL;

   America's immigration law is rather like a hedgehog: it has a
hard, prickly exterior, but its center is surprisingly soft. The
rules that govern immigrants' entry into America and their legal
status thereafter are, in turn, contradictory, disingenuous,
hypocritical, downright cruel and ridiculously overly generous.

   Like so many other revolutions, America's ethnic make-over
officially dates back to 1965, when Congress dropped the hated
national quotas it had imposed in the 1920s. Instead, it brought in
quotas that favored family ties. In some ways the act was a
surrender to the status quo. Today, most immigrants fall into one
of five categories...By John Micklethwait, The Economist &QL;

   Yes, most of the evidence suggests that the current wave of
immigration is good for America. But it is not good for everybody;
and the general benefits are often harder to identify than the
specific costs. Broadly speaking, though, most of the numbers

Washington Post of 2,500 Latinos showed that nine out of ten who

   ``Today's learner is tomorrow's leader.'' The motto of Public
School 220 in Queens, N.Y., would do nicely for most New Americans.
Many of the notes pinned on the school's bulletin boards _ sample:
``Snowflakes are different, and so are we'' _ hint at the
challenges of trying to teach students who between them speak 26
foreign languages at home. Bilingual education is only part of the
problem, but it is indicative of the raw deal immigrants are
getting from America's education system...By John Micklethwait, The

   Latinos in America control around $300 billion of spending
power, and Asians another $100 billion. Yet immigrant groups
complain about being patronized or ignored by mainstream business.
This will change, if only because the newcomers, being young, will
play a growing part in setting the trends. As the editor of Latina,
a magazine for young girls, explained to Newsweek: ``Blacks said
`We will overcome.' Our motto is `We will overwhelm.'''...By John

   Latino politicians in America are finding power elusive because
their supporters will not turn out at elections. Despite its large
Latino community, Los Angeles is still essentially run by Jews and
blacks. In national politics, Latinos make up only around 7 percent
of the likely voters, half the figure for blacks, but they may
punch above their weight in the presidential election later this
year...By John Micklethwait, The Economist &QL;

   Thanks to immigration, America has once again assembled a team
of people who have shown their willingness to compete and their
belief in the American Dream. Look around the United States _ not
only at the affluent Indian programmers in Silicon Valley and the
newly self-confident Latino middle class in Los Angeles, but at the
undernourished Uzbek children in Queens or the wretched Tejanos on
the Texas/Mexico border _ and you will find the drive is still
there. The rest of the country must not waste it...By John

   ``Today's learner is tomorrow's leader.'' The motto of Public
School 220 in Queens, N.Y., would do nicely for most New Americans.
Many of the notes pinned on the school's bulletin boards _ sample:
``Snowflakes are different, and so are we'' _ hint at the
challenges of trying to teach students who between them speak 26
foreign languages at home. Bilingual education is only part of the
problem, but it is indicative of the raw deal immigrants are
getting from America's education system...By John Micklethwait, The

   Latinos in America control around $300 billion of spending
power, and Asians another $100 billion. Yet immigrant groups
complain about being patronized or ignored by mainstream business.
This will change, if only because the newcomers, being young, will
play a growing part in setting the trends. As the editor of Latina,
a magazine for young girls, explained to Newsweek: ``Blacks said

   Latino politicians in America are finding power elusive because
their supporters will not turn out at elections. Despite its large
Latino community, Los Angeles is still essentially run by Jews and
blacks. In national politics, Latinos make up only around 7 percent
of the likely voters, half the figure for blacks, but they may
punch above their weight in the presidential election later this
year...By John Micklethwait, The Economist &QL;

of people who have shown their willingness to compete and their
belief in the American Dream. Look around the United States _ not
only at the affluent Indian programmers in Silicon Valley and the

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Here we go again. ``Making Choices,'' the second
segment of ``MOMA 2000,'' the self-reflective (navel-gazing?)
trilogy of exhibition cycles with which the Museum of Modern Art is
greeting the millennium, has begun its staged landing. Its subtitle
indicates what is in store in this second round: ``24 Exhibitions
of Modern Art From 1920 to 1960.'' Eleven can be seen now, three
more open on March 30 and the remaining 10 on April 30.
</P>
<P>
   The trilogy began last fall with ``Modern Starts: People, Places
and Things,'' which considered mostly European art from 1880 to
1920 and was organized by a team of curators led by John
Elderfield, chief curator at large at the museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Making Choices,'' which looks at the next four decades, has
been overseen by Peter Galassi, chief curator of the museum's
photography department, working with Robert Storr and Anne Umland,
respectively senior curator and associate curator in the department
of painting and sculpture. Surrealism, the Bauhaus and the
International Style, the rise of photography, advertising and the
movies, Abstract Expressionism and the first stirrings of Pop Art
and Minimalism, as well as the founding of the Modern itself _ all
fall within the exhibition's purview; most are examined or touched
on in this opening gambit of shows, or will be in those to come.
</P>
<P>
   After the 24 shows close (also in stages) beginning in late
August, a curatorial team headed by Kirk Varnedoe, chief curator of
the department of painting and sculpture, will present the final
installment, ``Open Ends,'' which will bring art up to the present.
</P>
<P>
   This project is much more than a historical survey of the 120
years spanned by the Modern's collection divided into three neat
slices. It is an enormous and free-form stock-taking during which
the Modern's curators have been given carte blanche to sort through
the collection and mix things up, mingling media in a way that is
still out of character for the Modern, and to bring in works from
other periods when germane.
</P>
<P>
   Their mission, not impossible at all, is to experiment with the
Modern's vaunted collection in ways that move beyond the museum's
highly influential, largely linear, style-by-style and
medium-by-medium presentation of that collection. The pressures to
do this come from all directions: the end of the century whose art
history the Modern so prominently defined; the far more porous,
nonlinear definition of modernism lately proposed by postmodern
theorists and art historians, and the pending expansion of the
museum's building, which will give the institution more space in
which to tell a fuller story.
</P>
<P>
   Elderfield gave ``Modern Starts'' a unifying concept, dividing
the art according to the traditional artistic subjects of people,
places and things. Yet beneath the thematic umbrella, his team's
20-odd shows often lurched between extremes of homogeneity,
monotony and discord. One saw things that seemed unprecedented for
the Modern: a gallery, painted dark green, full of late 19th- and
early 20th-century figurative, mostly bronze sculptures, another
gallery devoted exclusively to paintings made in Paris during World
War I. The shows seemed to smash the Modern's traditional narrative
to smithereens, but they still managed to keep most of modernism's
big names front and center.
</P>
<P>
   The curators of ``Making Choices'' have avoided any overriding
concept and instead have strung together a series of medium-size
theme shows punctuated by small ones devoted to single artists,
organized by themselves and other curators. One could say that what
was rent asunder by ``Modern Starts'' is here being judiciously
reassembled and reconfigured. Iconoclasm has given way to inspired
tinkering and readjustment. Nothing feels too long, too homogenous
or too discordant. Everything looks plausible as a Museum of Modern
Art show, and an exceptional one at that: temperate, beautifully
installed, thought through.
</P>
<P>
   Yet a complex game is quietly afoot. While pulverization has
been avoided, there has been a concerted effort to level the
playing field, to take modernism out of the hands of the anointed
few and show it to be an effort of hundreds of people working alone
or together in a range of styles and media.
</P>
<P>
   ``Choices'' is the operative word. Especially level, is the book
that accompanies but does not catalog the exhibition. It is a
compendium that reproduces 306 works in all media from the Modern's
holdings.
</P>
<P>
   Each was made in one of four years that the curators have deemed
historically and aesthetically significant: 1929, 1939, 1948 or
1955. The point of these ``core samples'' is to ignore not only the
Modern's version of modern art history but any version, to simply
show that in art as in life everything is happening at once, all
the time. ``History is flux,'' states the brief introduction, ``a
vast matrix almost inconceivably extensive and almost inconceivably
dense.''
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to convey and to organize some of that flux for
the viewer, the shows unfold with carefully calibrated shifts in
subject, size, visual rhythm and also curatorial strategy.
</P>
<P>
   In ``War,'' organized by Storr, subject matter reigns, and the
century's major conflicts are often wrenchingly evoked. But its
weight is relieved by what comes next: the ivory-tower purity of a
small exhibition of Giorgio Morandi's landscape and still-life
etchings organized by Starr Figura, assistant curator of prints and
illustrated books.
</P>
<P>
   Other small shows focus on the efforts of artists who rarely get
top billing: the quiet polymathic work _ paintings, relief, poetry,
sculpture _ of Jean Arp (organized by Umland); the consistently
sultry innovative photographs of Man Ray (organized by Virginia
Heckert, a curatorial fellow in the photography department); and
the late 1950s and '60s designs of the architect Louis I. Kahn, who
looked past the glass curtain wall to the monolithic forms of
ancient architecture for inspiration. (In this show, organized by
Peter Reed of the architecture and design department, don't miss
the big, pulsating drawing of a grid whereby Kahn re-envisioned the
traffic patterns of downtown Philadelphia.) A quibble: taken as a
group, these artists are a tad on the quiet side. It might have
been nice to isolate a straining-at-the-leash type like Otto Dix,
who does appear in several shows.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout these exhibitions media are regularly and often
imaginatively mixed; every gallery features two and usually more.
The Surrealist half of Storr's ``Dream of Utopia/Utopia of the
Dream'' (in the lead for worst-title prize) includes paintings,
drawings, sculptures and photographs by artists ranging from Ernst
and Magritte to Horst P. Horst to the recently resurrected sculptor
Maria Martins. There is also a vitrine of Surrealist publications
illustrated by many of the same artists _ something probably never
done at the Modern.
</P>
<P>
   When things do turn homogenous, they still feel fresh, as with
the large group of tubular-steel furniture in ``Modern Living 1,''
which demonstrates how many designers and architects responded to a
new material. This show, organized by Matilda McQuaid and
Christopher Mount, associate curator and assistant curator of
architecture and design respectively, concludes with an unannounced
one-artist cluster: a series of textiles and textile designs by
Anni Albers. It's great to see, especially after the intriguing
sight of a single Albers drawing among works by Klee, Kandinsky and
Sophie Taeuber-Arp in the Bauhaus part of ``The Dream of
Utopia/Utopia of the Dream.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   There are few overexposed masterpieces (although it will be
interesting to see if every part of the ``MOMA 2000'' trilogy must
include Meret Oppenheim's fur-lined teacup; so far it is two for
two.) There are surprising works by known, lesser-known and unknown
artists in nearly every gallery.
</P>
<P>
   Regard the labels. Often, a work that appears to be by one
artist is actually by someone unexpected. For example, in
``Graphic/Photographic,'' a 1921 graphic design that looks right at
home next to one of Kurt Schwitters' designs for his magazine,
Merz, turns out to be by the Surrealist Pavel Tchelitchew, who
would later paint ``Hide and Seek,'' one of the Modern's two most
popular paintings. Their juxtaposition is typical of this dense,
smallish show, organized by Galassi and Mount. They examine the
overlap of photography and graphic design between the wars through
the efforts of a large and diverse cast of sensibilities, from
August Sander to Florence Henri, and the Stenberg brothers to
Herbert Bayer.
</P>
<P>
   The two most ambitious shows, each accompanied by its own thick
catalog, are Storr's ``Modern Art Despite Modernism'' and Galassi's
``Walker Evans &AMP; Co.'' Storr's effort concentrates entirely on
figurative art, reminding us that the Modern has always collected
art that might be called nonmodern or antimodern, along with the
so-called modern kind. Depending on how one you enters Storr's
show, it opens with three Balthus paintings, or a marvelously dark
Matissean still-life-with-window that is actually by Andre Derain.
Later one encounters the ever-popular ``Hide and Seek'' and Andrew
Wyeth's ``Christina's World.'' Drawings and prints are plentiful,
which stresses the artists' different formal approaches over their
shared subject matter. In one of the best drawings a 20-year-old
Jean Dubuffet brings off a neo-Classical portrait to rival those,
nearby, of Braque and Picasso.
</P>
<P>
   At times Storr seems to incline toward the Modern of old: a wall
of German Expressionists here, a wall of weird American realists
(Ivan Albright, Paul Cadmus) there. But the Germans are in a
gallery that includes an enchanting self-portrait by a little-known
Mexican artist named Jose Pancetti, works by Frida Kahlo and Diego
Rivera, and the paintings of Walter Sickert, Gwen John and Stanley
Spencer, British English artists rarely seen in these parts. And
the wall of Americans includes Honore Sharrer's jewel-like
``Workers People and Paintings,'' which shows a dark little main
street lined with people of different races and cultures, all
examining well-known, brightly- colored paintings, among them ` one
of the Modern's Picassos, ``Girl Before a Mirror.'' Man cannot live
by bread alone, it seems to say.
</P>
<P>
   Another surprise is ``Young Man in the Sun,'' an exquisite
drawing on pale green paper made in 1935 by Carl Pickhardt. It
jibes perfectly with a work in the next gallery, Alex Katz's
drawing of a young sunbather, ``Boy With a Hat,'' from 1974. One of
Storr's ideas, filled out in the catalog and unfortunately
truncated in the show, is that the Modern's buried strain of
figuration sets the stage for the recent return of representation.
He has squeezed in some contemporary work, including a fabulous new
portrait by Jim Nutt, two late-40's portraits by Lucian Freud and,
less impressively, work by Komar and Melamid and Troy Brauntuch.
But it is not enough. It is too bad that there was no room for
David Salle's ``Muscular Paper,'' from 1985, detailed on the
catalog's title page, which the Modern acquired in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``Walker Evans &AMP; Co.'' is in many ways the standout of the
opening 11, in part because Galassi has the room to follow his
thesis into the present. On the face of things his show looks like
an attempt to validate Evans as the Jackson Pollock or Pablo
Picasso of American photography. And indeed, this show presents
Evans as a highly influential artist who helped establish the
uninflected documentation of America _ its people, architecture,
well-worn interiors, towns, storefronts, signage and advertising _
as a worthy artistic subject.
</P>
<P>
   But Galassi does this with an unusual inclusiveness, mixing
Evans' work with that of 100 other photographers and artists.
Crediting Evans' forebears and his contemporaries, Galassi suggests
that no artist acts alone. He then widens his scope, showing how
Evans is a precedent not only for such great photographers as
Robert Frank, Lee Friedlander and Diane Arbus, but also for Pop Art
and photo appropriation, as well as for the sculpture of Robert
Gober and the architecture of Robert Venturi.
</P>
<P>
   Thus this show tracks an amazing complex map of influence. It
shows not a single line or a straight one, but a series of
branches, crossing and recrossing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Modern Art Despite Modernism'' and ``Walker Evans &AMP; Co.'' say
emphatically and in considerable detail what seems to be the
underlying message of all the other shows, that it is almost all
here in this museum if we just figure out how to use it. One hopes
that the next 13 shows will reveal the tangled path of art with
such clarity.
</P>
<P>
   As the ``MOMA 2000'' trilogy proceeds, it is emerging as a
series of curatorial points and counterpoints, a meditation on the
curator's art. It is also a kind of exquisite corpse. Its different
parts are being created autonomously and asthey unfold, each fits
with the others in ways that are giving the Modern and its audience
plenty to think about.  &QL;

`FARSCAPE': AN OFF-KILTER OUTER-SPACE SERIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review. Time, channel are for
New York area. Check local listings.) 
(lh) 
 By RON WERTHEIMER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I'm just looking for a way home,'' says the earthling
astronaut John Crichton during the opening credits of ``Farscape.''
At the rate he's going, he'll never make it. But that would be just
fine with the fans of this off-kilter outer-space series, which
begins its second season Friday night on the Sci-Fi Channel.
Invigorated by the show's weekly jolt of imagination overload, they
hope that Crichton (played by Ben Browder) keeps drifting through
the void with a mismatched bunch of intergalactic fugitives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Farscape,'' created by Rockne S. O'Bannon and packaged by the
fantasymeisters at the Jim Henson Company and Hallmark
Entertainment, has more familiar elements than a periodic table.
You'll find echoes of ``The Odyssey'' and ``Les Miserables,'' of
``The Wizard of Oz'' and ``Gilligan's Island,'' and compounds
distilled from ``Star Wars,'' ``Star Trek'' and maybe even
Starbucks. Still, there's something special about this mixture: a
grin-inducing strain of inspiration that seems to say, simply,
``Sit there, and I'll tell you a story.''
</P>
<P>
   That story can get a bit complicated. Here's some of what has
happened so far:
</P>
<P>
   Crichton is being hounded through space by Crais (Lani John
Tupu), a renegade from a powerful bunch of warriors called the
Peacekeepers. Crais' brother was killed in an accidental collision
with Crichton's off-course module; Crais craves revenge.
</P>
<P>
   Now Crichton is trying to escape aboard Moya, a living leviathan
spaceship who can get kind of moody, especially when she's worried
about the safety and whereabouts of her son, Talyn, who was born at
the end of last season. Although Moya can more than think for
herself, she is piloted by Pilot (a Muppet with a voice supplied by
Tupu), who is organically attached to Moya and couldn't leave his
post if he wanted to, which he wouldn't anyway. Would you?
</P>
<P>
   The fate of Crichton, who looks like your typical sandy-haired
action hero, is bound to those of his fellow travelers. The
strongest and smartest of the bunch (Crichton included) is Aeryn
Sun (Claudia Black), a runaway Peacekeeper, who looks like your
typical unbelievably fit raven-haired commando in skintight togs.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Ka D'Argo (Anthony Simcoe), a hulking Luxan, a sort
of huge bear with an owl's face and a seminarian's hunger for moral
truth; Pa'u Zotoh Zhaan (Virginia Hey), a blue bald-headed Delvian
priestess; Chiana (Gigi Edgley), a quick-witted
tattletale-gray-skinned sylph who wears very little and talks like
a valley girl (although one cannot imagine just which valley); and
the beach-ball-size Rygel XVI (voice by Jonathan Hardy), who can't
get used to losing a king's perks, even though he was overthrown
250 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night's episode picks up where the first season ended,
with the refugees fleeing not only Crais but the unspeakably evil
Scorpius (Wayne Pygram), a cadaverous fellow whose head is secured
inside headgear that looks as if he stole it from a World War I
flying ace. The sight of Scorpius having some sort of glowing
crystal inside his head replaced through the side of his helmet is,
to say the least, memorable. (The series manages to proffer a
couple of such dandy visual effects each week.)
</P>
<P>
   Crais promises to leave Crichton and company alone if Crais can
make off with Talyn, the baby ship. Asked what he wants, Crais
replies, ``Simply to escape, to travel deeper into the uncharted
territories, to re-examine my path.''
</P>
<P>
   Crichton replies: ``You want to have a midlife crisis, fine.
Just ditch the firm, head off to Maui, shack up with the
supermodel. But you do not get to keep the Porsche. You don't get
the keys to Moya's baby.''
</P>
<P>
   Crais can't seem to make sense of the references. But making
literal sense isn't what this show is about. It's about friendship
and doing your best and knowing right from wrong. Or something. You
try to figure it out. Like Crichton, you may not always know where
you're going, but you'll surely remember the journey.

   This has nothing to do with Freud, that ignoramus. We're talking
politics here, folks, not hanky-panky.
</P>
<P>
   The gender gap that first appeared in the 1980 presidential
election when Ronald Reagan swept the country is still with us.
Reagan's macho manner and his campaign appeal to Southern white
males split the sexes, winning over a majority of men but turning
off a majority of women.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Democratic presidential candidates have consistently
done better at the polls with women than have Republican
candidates. President Clinton enjoyed an 11-point advantage among
women in 1996, the largest ever in a presidential election and the
single most important factor to his re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes a new USA Today-CNN-Gallup poll that shows if the
election were held today, 15 percent more women than men would vote
for Vice President Al Gore, while 12 percent more men than women
would vote for Texas Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The funny part is that a year ago, polls showed the reverse,
with 12 percent more women backing Bush than Gore. In those golden
days, however, Bush was beating the socks off Gore everywhere in
every way. It couldn't last, and didn't. The two contenders are,
overall, in a statistical dead heat.
</P>
<P>
   Republican strategists talk a great deal about wooing female
voters but they don't know how to go about it. They take a
patronizing view toward our political intelligence. If the GOP just
softens its campaign language to sound more family-friendly, they
figure, moms by the carload will come to their senses and desert
the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   It is a cynical strategy, since no accompanying change in policy
is contemplated. The basic GOP platform is stuck in cement: less
government oversight of business practices and massive tax cuts for
the wealthy.
</P>
<P>
   Many women do not think concentrating more wealth at the top of
society can improve their own lives, particularly if it means
cutbacks in popular federal domestic programs and services. They
want to hear what the candidates will do for THEM, not for distant
vested interests.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's original theme of ``compassionate conservatism''
specifically had women in mind. But it was too mild and mushy to
stand up under the brutal barrage of insults he exchanged with
Arizona Sen. John McCain, his main primary rival. That message has
been lost for the moment, although Bush will try to return to it.
</P>
<P>
   Words are not enough. Policies matter, and so do personalities.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have done well with female voters because they have
emphasized education, health care reform, the environment, gun
control and Social Security protection.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, men see politics through the prism of economic
prospects and their workday jobs. Women hold outside jobs too but
are also more directly involved in family responsibilities _
raising children, caring for elderly relatives, worrying about
health care, fearing random violence and fending off all the
self-appointed moralists who lecture them on how to conduct their
private lives.
</P>
<P>
   Gore understands this. He won the New Hampshire Democratic
primary because women gave him a 53 percent to 47 percent margin
over Bill Bradley, while the male vote split evenly.
</P>
<P>
   Bush can go after more male votes or he can try to reach out to
moderate women. He will get conservative women, as he will get
conservative males. But he needs a broader appeal. And his personal
history and his record make the latter tough for him.
</P>
<P>
   There is the gun control problem. As governor, Bush signed bills
allowing Texans to carry concealed _ concealed! _ handguns on the
streets and laws barring local jurisdictions from suing gun
manufacturers to recoup the public health costs of treating gunshot
wounds. He never supported a gun control measure, although now he
suggests he might go for some long-demanded minor ones on the
federal level.
</P>
<P>
   There is the abortion problem. A stand that honors a fetus over
a pregnant woman's life sends a message suggesting the second-class
status of women. Bush initially favored dropping the party's rigid
refusal to make an exception for the health of the mother in its
demand to criminalize abortion. But by the time the religious right
worked him over, he was back at the uncompromising position.
</P>
<P>
   There is also the Social Security-health care issue. Bush's
proposed tax cuts are so enormous that even the Republican
congressional majority could not swallow them this week. The
problem is that he put his tax cuts ahead of concern for Social
Security, and his priorities are in the wrong place.
</P>
<P>
   But so much for the policies. How about the personalities? Aha,
that's another subject, yet to be determined. Women will be
watching.

`SPECTRES OF THE SPECTRUM': LIMITS OF SPACE, PARANOIA AND
COMPREHENSION 
</HEADLINE>
  (Editors: Production notes appear at end of review.) 
(DW) 
 By A.O.SCOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Spectres of the Spectrum'' is a sci-fi thriller about a
renegade scientist named Yogi and his daughter, Boo-Boo, a psychic
media terrorist, who set out one day in the year 2007 to disrupt a
magnetic pulse that threatens to erase the memories of everyone on
the planet. Wait, that's not quite right. Let's try again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spectres of the Spectrum'' is a documentary collage, composed
of scraps from 1950s television shows, defense department films and
an obscure educational docudrama on the life of Alexander Graham
Bell, among other things. It marshals a great deal of evidence to
support many provocative arguments about technology, the media,
electromagnetism, the science of cosmography and the spirit world,
none of which, sadly, can be reconstructed here, owing to
limitations of space and comprehension.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there may be other reasons. It may be that I can't
tell you what this movie is about because ``they'' _ meaning, as
far as I can tell, a collection of people including David Sarnoff,
Admiral Nimitz and L. Ron Hubbard, as well as the suspiciously
affable Dr. Herald, host of the now forgotten program ``Science in
Action'' _ don't want me to.
</P>
<P>
   Because if the truth about this stuff ever got out, boy, it
would blow the lid off the whole thing. (You know, the whole
electromagnetic media-monopoly military-industrial complex orgone
box Tesla coil thing. Do I have to spell it out for you?) Because I
have a tiny chip implanted in my left rear molar that tells me to
say just what they want me to. You think I'm paranoid? That's what
they want you to think.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spectres of the Spectrum,'' which opens Friday at the Cinema
Village after being shown at the New York Underground Film Festival
on Sunday, is like a 90-minute compendium of conspiracy theories,
propounded more or less in earnest and with great urgency by Craig
Baldwin.
</P>
<P>
   Baldwin has produced three previous films on similar themes by
similar means _ found film clips, wild sound and a special-effects
budget amounting to tens of dollars. To call him an independent
filmmaker is a bit like calling a man who stands on a street corner
distributing smudgy hand-lettered leaflets an independent
publisher. He works cheaply and with evident cinematic flair. What
he produces, exhausting and ultimately bewildering as it is, is not
without a certain visual and conceptual brilliance, or, thankfully,
a sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   The images come at you in a rush _ Dean Martin, Sputnik, Thomas
Edison, Wilhelm Reich, the Zapatistas, the Van Allen Belt _ and the
voice-over races along with them. Baldwin tells and retells recent
history as an epic of suspicious coincidence, wild science and the
struggle between individual freedom and corporate domination. How
this ends up with a climactic episode of time travel in a modified
trailer may escape you, but you ignore this movie's message at your
peril. And if you figure out what it is, please let me know.

`TREASURE ISLAND': A CHAOTIC COMEDY ON WORLD WAR II 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes are at end of review) 
(af) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the film ``Saving Private Ryan'' and the book ``The
Greatest Generation,'' World War II has made a spectacular public
relations comeback in the last three years as the United States has
finally recovered from the lingering post-Vietnam blues.
</P>
<P>
   Triumphantly reclaimed, the war, in most people's minds, once
again represents what it did in the 1950s: the apogee of American
heroism and rectitude.
</P>
<P>
   But even the noblest endeavor has its dark underside. And
``Treasure Island,'' an intermittently witty parody of a 1940s
movie with an angry political agenda, heaves and strains to put
self-congratulation and flag-waving about the past in some
perspective.
</P>
<P>
   This independent black-and-white film, which takes its name not
from Robert Louis Stevenson but from a San Francisco naval base, is
a surreal, increasingly chaotic comic riff on ``The Man Who Never
Was,'' Ewen Montague's account (made into a 1956 film starring
Clifton Webb) of a scheme concocted by British intelligence to
mislead Germany about the invasion of Sicily.
</P>
<P>
   The deception involved arranging for the corpse of a British
naval officer carrying bogus secret documents to be washed up on
the coast of Spain.
</P>
<P>
   In the parody, dreamed up by Scott King, who wrote and filmed
``Treasure Island'' with a 1936-vintage camera, a body outfitted
with false papers and letters describing an imaginary personal
history is kept in an office where Samuel (Nick Offerman), a
mathematician specializing in code, collaborates with Frank (Lance
Baker), a linguist. They plan to deposit the body with its false
documents in the Pacific for the Japanese to discover.
</P>
<P>
   Both Samuel and Frank lead guarded, secretive lives. The burly,
macho Samuel camouflages his latent homosexuality by regularly
bringing strange men home to have three-way sex with him and his
wife, Penny (Daisy Hall).
</P>
<P>
   Frank juggles two wives and a fiancee. One wife, Yo-Ji (Suzy
Nakamura), is a Japanese woman hiding out in Chinatown to avoid
being sent to an internment camp. The other, Anna (Rachel Singer),
is a skinny bundle of nerves severely afflicted with psoriasis. His
fiancee is the blunt, sexually aggressive Stella (Stephanie
Ittleson).
</P>
<P>
   Overstuffed with characters whose identities are inadequately
explained, the movie jumps around awkwardly from person to person
to create a kinky '40s mosaic of frightened, repressed American
patriots. As Samuel and Frank devise an easily crackable code for
the papers to accompany the body, their talk about ``Japs'' is
casually and viciously racist (the way it really was during the
war, when it was convenient and probably necessary to demonize the
enemy).
</P>
<P>
   The film makes an elaborate and glaringly out-of-place sidetrack
to the rape trial of a man played by an actor in blackface, a
reminder that similar attitudes applied to blacks in those days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Treasure Island,'' which opens Friday in New York, takes a
macabre science-fiction turn when the body comes to life. (At
least, it does in the minds of the two men creating its false
identity.) To Samuel, the creature that stirs to life is his
suppressed shadow self, a mocking, proudly effeminate 97-pound
weakling ogling him with a lascivious leer.
</P>
<P>
   Scene by scene, ``Treasure Island'' loses its narrative
continuity as it turns into an increasingly strident,
finger-pointing essay. At the last minute, it throws in a
corrective vision of V-J Day, suggesting that many of the innocent
kisses shared by strangers in famous vintage photographs gave way
to rapes and other acts of random violence.
</P>
<P>
   For all the ideas it tosses around _ and many of them are useful
and painful correctives to our rose-colored fantasies _ ``Treasure
Island'' is too crude a movie to muster much rhetorical clout. But
in deconstructing a myth, it does find one ingenious parallel: its
man who never was a paradigm becomes a paradigm for an era that
never was. Or at least it wasn't the way we would like to remember
it. &QL;

<P>
   DO MAKE SAY THINK: ``Goodbye Enemy Airship the Landlord Is
Dead'' (Constellation)
</P>
<P>
   One of the original intents of rock 'n' roll, and later punk and
now indie rock _ that whole series of basement rebellions since the
1950s _ has been to show up the professionals. But at a certain
point, naivete isn't enough. Charming technical limitations become
insurmountable walls, and applying amateurish rock technique to
more complicated music seems contrary to the point, or not worth
the effort.
</P>
<P>
   The phenomenon of post-rock, the contemplative art music of the
indie scene, addressed that problem in the '90s, and now we're
already in post-rock's second generation, seeing new bands building
on the work of forerunners like Tortoise and Slint.
</P>
<P>
   The instrumental sextet Do Make Say Think, from Toronto, is one:
it plays long, heavily plotted songs that are spacey, gooey with
echo, densely layered and often beautiful. The gift of post-rock's
first wave may not be its jazz-influenced chords and rhythms as
much as a knowledge of studio hardware: the inspired low-budget
production on this album, the band's second, keeps all the music's
elements in flux, commanding your attention to zoom in on tiny
details.
</P>
<P>
   ``Goodbye Enemy Airship'' is dotted with musical naivete: one of
its two drummers has trouble keeping a groove and some relatively
simple guitar and saxophone parts are played a little gracelessly.
But the indie-rock amateurism isn't grating; it's just part of the
band's honesty and dedication.
</P>
<P>
   Tracks abruptly change tempos and moods, from one drone to
another. Bubbling, crackling noises from analogue synthesizers
briefly hijack a song. A drum pattern comes in and saturates the
recording; then the microphones seem to roll backward from the
drums and bring them into focus.
</P>
<P>
   It's a headphones album and, as with dub reggae, there's so much
tension-and-release and spatial effects in the music that it almost
becomes a visual experience.

   Being Charlie Kaufman
</P>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Hundreds of the most famous faces in movies mingled
over drinks in the lobby at the Academy Awards Nominees Luncheon or
posed for pictures on the red-carpet arrival line, a bright chatter
of successful Hollywood celebrating itself. But Charlie Kaufman sat
alone at one of the otherwise empty tables in the Beverly Hilton's
grand ballroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really hate this kind of thing,'' Kaufman said. He wore the
distinctive black badge that identified him as an actual nominee,
in his case for writing the script for Spike Jonze's ``Being John
Malkovich,'' arguably the most dementedly original script in a year
celebrated for its original screenwriting. He looked utterly
uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   Kaufman said his life hadn't really changed much since the movie
was released. ``I'm doing my work,'' he said. ``I'm a writer, so I
work by myself. I get up, I try to write and I panic when I
can't.''
</P>
<P>
   The stars began to trickle past. Tom Cruise. Warren Beatty and
an extremely pregnant Annette Bening. Julianne Moore. Jonze came by
to say hello. Catherine Keener, nominated for best supporting
actress for the film, gave him a hug. ``Being John Malkovich'' was
written five years ago, Kaufman said, and took all that time to
make it to the screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has all been surprising, I guess,'' he said. ``I never
really expected John Malkovich to even read the thing, much less
agree to be in it. It went through all of that and then it got
made. It's all very exciting and gratifying.''
</P>
<P>
   When the time came, Kaufman jumped up and joined the throng of
nominees posing for the ``class photo'' _ everyone who is up for an
Oscar this year at the March 26 ceremonies in the Shrine
Auditorium. But he didn't seem happy about it. He said the other
moviemakers and the film's distributor hadn't pushed him too hard
to give interviews and have his picture taken.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm kind of a little bit shy,'' he said. ``And they know this,
so they're gentle.''
</P>
<P>
   Just the Facts
</P>
<P>
   Susannah Grant said she watched from the sidelines late last
year as controversies erupted over the accuracy of various portions
of ``The Insider,'' Michael Mann's thriller about big tobacco and
big media, and ``The Hurricane,'' Norman Jewison's drama about
efforts to undo the murder conviction of the boxer Rubin Carter.
</P>
<P>
   But Grant said she remained confident that such complaints would
not bedevil ``Erin Brockovich,'' the based-on-a-true-story drama
she wrote that stars Julia Roberts as a legal secretary who
uncovers a California public utility's toxic dumping ground. She
said she and the director, Steven Soderbergh, worked hard to tell
the story as accurately as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Steven came on to the project, he just said he wanted it
to be true, period,'' Grant said.
</P>
<P>
   There are composites in the film, and some characters' names
have been changed, she said, but the sequence of events and the
actions of the pivotal characters are as close to accurate as the
filmmakers could render them.
</P>
<P>
   It promises to be a busy few weeks for Grant, who came to
Hollywood nine years ago to study at the American Film Institute.
After ``Erin Brockovich'' is released this weekend, Grant will be
looking forward to the April 14 release of ``28 Days,'' a comic
drama she wrote that stars Sandra Bullock as a woman going through
drug and alcohol rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been a lot of serious, inaccessible movies about
rehab,'' Grant said. ``So I really wanted to make one that had some
laughter in it, too. Because people don't stop laughing just
because they go into rehab. Some of the best moments in rehab come
from people laughing about the things they did before they were
sober.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Grant plans to buckle down and finish the script she is
preparing for her debut as a director. She won't discuss the plot,
though. ``It doesn't help if you tell the story too many times,''
she said. But she does acknowledge that there is a major, central
role for an older actress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Originally, I was going to work on another story,'' she said.
``But then I said to myself, `If I don't write these kind of
scripts with roles for older women, then who's going to do it?'''
</P>
<P>
   He's No. 1
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Pollak thoughtfully tugged on his cigar at the Grand
Havana Room, a private club for cigar lovers in Beverly Hills that
comes complete with private humidors bearing brass nameplates
(Arnold Schwarzenegger, Robert De Niro, John Travolta, Sylvester
Stallone and Pollak among them). He was talking about playing the
president of the United States, as he has done in his most recent
film, ``Deterrence,'' his debut in a leading role.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the writer and director, Rod Lurie, called and told me he
had a story that he wanted me to be in, I stopped him halfway
through and said, `Wait a minute, you want me to play the
president?''' said Pollak, a former stand-up comic. ``He said,
yeah, he saw this character as a kind of everyman president who's
almost accidentally thrust into the role.''
</P>
<P>
   Pollak said he had taken the part in the low-budget, independent
film both because he was attracted to the story and because it was
the lead. He certainly didn't do it for the money, he said: ``We
all basically worked for coffee and doughnuts.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he was glad it had taken so long for him to get a
leading role because by the time it came he felt confident and
ready to tackle it. ``I must say, though, it was very nice to show
up every day and to be, as they say, No. 1 on the call sheet,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Oscar's House
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Mondshein and Leslie Holleran probably have the only
house in Larchmont, N.Y., whose occupants, between them, have a
claim on 13 Academy Award nominations.
</P>
<P>
   Mondshein, a film editor, is nominated for his work on ``The
Sixth Sense,'' which has five other nominations. Holleran, his
wife, was a co-producer on ``The Cider House Rules,'' which is up
for seven Oscars. In four categories, Mondshein said, the couple's
films are competing head to head.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little bit of a competition,'' he said. ``A friendly
and supportive kind of competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it was Mondshein who introduced his wife to Lasse
Halstrom, the director of ``Cider House'' and a Westchester County
neighbor, and now Holleran has forged a regular working
relationship with the filmmaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel a little bit like ground zero these days,'' Holleran
said. ``We talk about it quite a bit. I knew the minute I heard the
news when they announced the nominations. I told Andy, `It will
never be better than it is this morning.'''

   DELHI _ Which is it to be, Mr. Clinton?
</P>
<P>
   The American president comes to India on March 20, the first
such visit for 22 years, and the subcontinent's two most
strenuously forward-looking cities, Bangalore and Hyderabad, are
competing furiously for his attention.
</P>
<P>
   Both are in the south of India, and are both vying to become the
most important centers of India's booming software industry but he
will only visit one of them. Which will it be?
</P>
<P>
   Bangalore is the obvious choice. The original home of India's IT
industry, the one home-grown industry since independence which has
truly shown signs of growing into a world beater.
</P>
<P>
   Bangalore is also the home of India's richest man, Wipro chief
executive Azim Premji, who is now hot on the heels of Microsoft's
Bill Gates for the title of richest man in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Indians dub Bangalore ``the garden city.'' It also has a balmy
climate and the glimmerings of a modern lifestyle for its
burgeoning middle class, notably a number of pubs where hard-driven
software engineers go to unwind.
</P>
<P>
   Amid these pleasant surroundings, the city's software companies
have increased their exports from 50 million rupees in 1991-2 to 32
billion in 1998-9, making it without question the IT capital of
India.
</P>
<P>
   Hyderabad, by contrast, is an upstart, with less than one-tenth
the value of Bangalore's software exports.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the competition for Clinton's attention has been fierce, and
there have recently been some indications that Hyderabad may clinch
it. If it does, two men can share the credit: Bill Gates and
Chandrababu Naidu.
</P>
<P>
   Bangalore's problem is that the IT companies have made their
homes there despite rather than because of Karnataka state's
politicians and policies.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its natural endowments, Bangalore, like most Indian
cities, is strikingly ill-governed. The power supply is inadequate
and erratic, with wild fluctuations in voltage; the air, which
should be perfumed by the millions of flowers, instead is poisoned
by the fumes of the thousands of rickshaws which run in place of
proper taxis.
</P>
<P>
   The last chief minister, J.H. Patel, didn't help much: he freely
confessed to the prime minister's task force on information
technology that he didn't understand the difference between
software and hardware.
</P>
<P>
   In Hyderabad, by contrast, the state's chief minister,
Chandrababu Naidu, is working overtime to ensure it becomes India's
first truly modern city, where high technology firms will function
with ease.
</P>
<P>
   By convincing Bill Gates, among other important foreigners, that
he really means it, and can pull it off, Naidu has gone a long way
to achieving his goal. Clinton's visit, if it transpires, will be
another milestone along the way.
</P>
<P>
   Last March, Microsoft opened a research and development center
on the top floor of Cyber Towers, Naidu's answer to Bangalore's
Electronics City. It was Microsoft's first research-and-development
facility outside corporate headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Cyber Towers looks set to succeed more smoothly than Bangalore's
equivalent. And the city displays a lucid appreciation of what IT
companies expect and need: totally dependable services, including
electricity, drinkable tap water, banks with ATMs, even speedy,
localized customs clearance.
</P>
<P>
   If it resembles a little node of extraterritoriality, almost a
colony, Naidu, recently voted man of the millennium by one national
newspaper, isn't bothered. The important thing is to give the lead.
</P>
<P>
   The speed with which he is transforming Hyderabad into a sort of
Indian Osaka or Shanghai is stunning.
</P>
<P>
   But although Naidu's achievement in Hyderabad displays much more
political muscularity than is the Indian norm, both he and his
recently elected opposite number in Bangalore, S.M. Krishna,
confront similar basic problems.
</P>
<P>
   Their substantially middle-class cities both sit amid vast
poverty-stricken hinterlands. The chief ministers babble of bytes
and hobnob with men worth billions. But millions of the people who
voted them into power have barely enough to eat, plough their
fields with the aid of bullocks, have no electricity and few
amenities of any sort.
</P>
<P>
   Many commit female infanticide or secretly sell girl babies to
escape the dowry trap.
</P>
<P>
   Literacy rates are low in both states. The north of Andhra
Pradesh, the state of which Hyderabad is capital, is racked by a
long-running insurgency by left extremists.
</P>
<P>
   India's permanent nightmare is of absolute polarization: of what
locally they call ``the creamy layer'' getting as rich as
middle-class consumers in the West _ richer, if you throw maids and
chauffeurs into the calculation _ while the outcasts, the bonded
laborers and poor farmers sink into permanent misery, or migrate to
the cities and scavenge what they can from the city's rubbish. &QL;

 &HT;    GORE'S OFFICE DEFENDS IRS CONTACTS
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories.
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congressional investigators said Thursday that two
aides to Vice President Al Gore had made questionable inquiries
about records at the Internal Revenue Service.
</P>
<P>
   The aides asked about the employment status of a labor union
associate, said Lindy Paull, staff director for the Joint Tax
Committee, as she released a three-year study of IRS practices.
</P>
<P>
   The report dismissed allegations of political bias by the IRS in
auditing nonprofit groups. However, it criticized the vice
president's staff for contacting the agency.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Quinn, communications director for the vice president,
defended the inquiries as proper.
</P>
<P>
   She said the staff members involved were Kumiki Gibson, who
served as the vice president's counsel, and Joe Eyer, an assistant
to the deputy chief of staff. Both have since left the White House.
</P>
<P>
   IRS officials declined to provide the information the aides
sought.
</P>
<P>
   Quinn said the two officials apparently asked the IRS in 1997
``how certain workers would be classified,'' either as contract
workers or full-time employees, by an unidentified labor union.
</P>
<P>
   Quinn said that Gibson, as a member of the White House counsel's
office, had the authority to ask such questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's within the guidelines for her to make inquiries in a
matter like this one, which was a policy, legislative or
administrative matter,'' Quinn said.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore spokeswoman said that her staff had been unable to
determine why the IRS had been contacted. She said that a check of
the vice president's schedule found no meetings with union groups
around the time of the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer, R-Texas,
who ordered the study three years ago, said Thursday that he was
``disturbed by the revelations in the report that administration''
had made the contacts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would hope that in the interests of full disclosure, all the
information and records relating to these contacts to the IRS by
the Office of the Vice President be made available to the public
and to the media immediately,'' Archer said.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury Department officials welcomed the general conclusions
of the report on the IRS.
</P>
<P>
   Of the instances of the Gore staff contacts and one other
instance involving a Treasury official, a spokesman said, ``The
report makes clear that neither contact influenced the conduct or
the outcome of any matter.''
</P>
<P>
   IRS Commissioner Charles O. Rossotti said, ``I think we can
conclusively lay to rest concerns that the resources of the IRS
have been diverted for political purposes. We will remain vigilant
to ensure that this admirable record is sustained into the
future.''
</P>
<P>
   Gibson, who is now at the Washington law firm of Williams &AMP;
Connolly, did not return a reporter's call.

 &HT;    N.C. students struggling in aftermath of historic flooding after
Floyd
 &HT;    By Glenda Jakubowski
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BETHEL, N.C. _ The poster affixed to the concrete-block wall of
music teacher Kathy Ulloa's classroom may not state a fact, but it
does tell a truth of sorts.
</P>
<P>
   ``A song makes the sun shine,'' the poster reads, with a
cheerful yellow cartoon sun shown triumphing over a stormy day.
</P>
<P>
   If it were a fact, all of Pitt County would have been singing
away the rains brought by Hurricane Floyd, which flooded the Tar
River and its feeder creeks to historic levels.
</P>
<P>
   Less than six months after the floodwaters have receded, it was
the truth of the poster's message that lit student's faces and
filled this Bethel Elementary classroom with song.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the floodwaters inspired the song.
</P>
<P>
   The 70-member chorus of sixth-, seventh- and eighth-graders
wrote the song for a contest sponsored by Weyerhaeuser. The theme
of the contest is flood recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Among the student lyricists is Kristen Abeyounis, who knows
something about recovering from floods. Her stepfather is a farmer
who lost 80 percent of his crops to the flood.
</P>
<P>
   After the hurricane, Kristen and her family waded through
waist-deep floodwaters, boarded a helicopter and flew to a shelter
in Tarboro, 15 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I looked down, all I could see was water, the tops of
trees and water,'' said Kristen, 14.
</P>
<P>
   The high school shelter was so crowded that Kristen and her
family had to sleep outside on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Floodwaters displaced students like Kristen throughout Pitt
County and eastern North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Pactolus Elementary in eastern Pitt County lost 167 students,
with 100 of them still attending school elsewhere. Wellcome Middle
School lost 125 students. Only 25 to 30 of those have returned to
the school. Belvoir lost 120 students. Kristen's school lost five
children.
</P>
<P>
   Other schools saw their populations grow. C.M. Eppes Middle
School, in Greenville, took in 70 new students who moved to
state-funded trailers for homeless flood victims. South Greenville
Elementary, also within city limits, found room for 40 additional
students. Grifton Elementary lost 16 of its own students and gained
16 from other schools.
</P>
<P>
   No teachers were reassigned from schools that lost a large
number of students, according to Gibb Chauncey, director of student
information for county schools. But teachers were added to schools
that gained significant numbers of students. Teacher assignments
for next year will be determined based on the student populations
at each school going into that school year.
</P>
<P>
   County schools were out of the business of education for 13 days
because of flooding.
</P>
<P>
   And it wasn't business as usual when classroom doors reopened.
</P>
<P>
   Students came to school without shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Students came to school without backpacks or books.
</P>
<P>
   Students came to school without homes.
</P>
<P>
   Kristen was lucky in that respect. The floodwaters came right up
to the steps leading to her house, but no further.
</P>
<P>
   Other children didn't fare so well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could go to work at Belk now, because I can look at any
child and tell what size they wear,'' said Belvoir Elementary
counselor Valerie Galberth. ``Teachers would line up their classes
for clothing and shoe fittings.''
</P>
<P>
   Even six months later, a number of children are not back in
their homes, and flood-related problems for some students can't be
fixed with a new pair of shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Arlene Ferren, director of student services with Pitt schools,
meets with counselors periodically. The counselors have seen an
increase in students' and teachers' stress since the flood, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing a lot of fighting and aggression ... to the point
that some schools have 'no-fight Fridays,' as incentives,'' Ferren
said.
</P>
<P>
   A ``no-fight Friday,'' according to the security officer at
North Pitt High School, occurs when students go an entire week
without a fight. If the next Monday through Thursday remains
fight-free, the students can leave class five minutes early that
Friday. The time off accumulates with each fight-free week, so that
students could shave five minutes off each day of the week, in
theory.
</P>
<P>
   Ferren said that children who formerly did very well are now
having trouble coping. Kids are breaking down and crying during and
after tests, and counselors are seeing significant signs of
depression.
</P>
<P>
   ``Depression among high school students is at an all-time
high,'' Ferren said.
</P>
<P>
   Several principals and teachers are worried about the flood's
effect on end-of-grade tests.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can't help but to be affected, because the students have
gone through a difficult time,'' said Bethel principal Roscoe
Locke, echoing the worries of many.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers at Bethel Elementary spoke about one student who could
represent many.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a good student, but he has suffered,'' said English
teacher Jennifer Berry, who teaches Kristen as well.
</P>
<P>
   Kristen's social studies teacher also knows this child, who lost
his house in the flood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I noticed behavior problems when he was most stressed out in
his private life,'' MaryAnne Pennington said. ``He became moody,
rude and obnoxious. He stopped turning in his work, and his grades
were slipping.''
</P>
<P>
   When the results of the child's behavior were reflected on his
report card, he came to Pennington and poured out his troubles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I should have told someone what I was feeling sooner,'' he
told the teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Pennington worries now about how many students were identified
as behavior problems or moody, when they were actually reacting to
their lives being turned upside-down.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has gradually turned back into the kid he was at the
beginning of the year,'' Pennington said. ``He's gotten through the
worst of it. He's back on the right road.''
</P>
<P>
   When music teacher Ulloa learned about the songwriting
competition, she saw an opportunity not just to win a contest, but
to help her students work through post-flood feelings.
</P>
<P>
   The children brainstormed, writing all their thoughts about the
flood on the blackboard, Ulloa said. Then they created rhyming
patterns, lyrics and a melody.
</P>
<P>
   The results were so good that a contest entry wasn't enough.
Ulloa decided to record a CD, which will be mass-produced and
available for sale to the public by the end of April. Proceeds will
benefit the school.
</P>
<P>
   Ulloa brought in Wesley Pritchard from Mill West Studios in
Fayetteville to record and mix the students' voices. Pritchard sat
in front of a mixing board with headphones over his ears and
adjusted slide controls while Ulloa arranged students on metal
risers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want baritones over here,'' Ulloa said, pointing to her
left. ``Sopranos in the middle, altos over here.''
</P>
<P>
   Seventy pairs of eyes locked in on Ulloa as she conducted the
students through the song with the particular sign language of a
chorus teacher, touching the tips of her fingers together, cupping
her cheekbones, exaggerating facial features.
</P>
<P>
   ``Y'all sound great,'' she said, after the first run-through.
</P>
<P>
   Pritchard shifted his headphones and asked the students for one
more chorus, and then another.
</P>
<P>
   The room was heating up. The kids looked a bit wilted. But when
they were asked to sing another chorus, when Pritchard asked for
just the sopranos, or just the baritones, or just one phrase, and
that phrase again and again, the kids gave it to him. These
children know about perseverance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take a breather,'' Ulloa finally told the students, who
collapsed in relieved chatter as they passed around cups of water.
Someone opened a window, searching for a breeze. Kristen Abeyounis
politely told her story as a tiny bead of sweat trickled from her
hairline.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was never going to get better,'' Kristen said.
``But you look around now and see everything is coming together,
and it is better.''
</P>
<P>
   The break was over. Ulloa called the students to order, arranged
them on the risers, and waited for Pritchard to nod the signal to
begin.
</P>
<P>
   On a sunny day that sparkled with springtime, with pear trees
and daffodils blooming and floodwaters long since receded, students
closed the music room's windows against traffic noise, stood up
straight, opened their mouths, and sang.
</P>
<P>
   Excerpt from ``We'll Arise''
</P>
<P>
   by the Bethel Elementary School chorus, taught by Kathy Ulloa
</P>
<P>
   Mother Nature is powerful to see
</P>
<P>
   She often moves unexpectedly
</P>
<P>
   In a moment least expected, the rivers began to rise
</P>
<P>
   The floods rushed in, covered the land, much to our surprise
(but)
</P>
<P>
   We'll arise, we'll restore, We will rebuild again
</P>
<P>
   Much was lost at such great cost
</P>
<P>
   Together we will stand
</P>
<P>
   Helping one another, cleaning up our coast
</P>
<P>
   Sharing everything we have with people who need it the most.

   ATTENTION GRAPHICS EDITORS -- WEATHER CHANGE ADVISORY:
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times News Service is planning an expanded weather
package, with a planned starting date of Monday, March 20, to be
transmitted Sunday, March 19. The package, consisting of a weather
map as a graphics file and a text file to accompany the map, is
available to graphics clients of the News Service.
</P>
<P>
   The new map grows to 4 columns in width (52 picas), from 3, and
is 6 inches deep; the old was 4 inches deep. This new size permits
the insertion of cloud cover information, previously a separate
map, and the addition of many new cities.
</P>
<P>
   The map is available both in color and in black and white.
Because the map is much more detailed, we have devised an entirely
new palette of colors to make it easier to read the added
information.
</P>
<P>
   A sample of the new map is available at Wieck, Newscom,
Presslink and AP's GraphicsNet.
</P>
<P>
   Some papers using the old map may need extra time to make the
transition to a 4-column format. We will, for a limited time,
produce a 3-col version of the new map, but with only some of the
new map's additional cities.

 &HT;    Gore trying to get handle on finance reform
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ What a year for conversions. Already, the Pope has
apologized for such excesses as the Inquisition, Bob Jones
University has allowed interracial dating, and Vice President Al
Gore is running on campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush's campaign has made sure via e-mail that the
political media has Jay Leno's latest laugh lines about Gore's
announcement that he's making campaign finance reform a
``cornerstone'' of his campaign. ``And he also said anybody could
have their name engraved on the cornerstone for a simple donation
of $10,000,'' cracked the late-night comic.
</P>
<P>
   It did take some nerve for Gore to spotlight this issue only a
few days after the sentencing of Maria Hsia in a case that hinged
largely on the money she raised at Gore's infamous Buddhist temple
appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have learned from my mistakes,'' Gore said. If he were
consciously trying to get a rise out of his Republican detractors,
the vice president could not have chosen more irritating words. ``I
have a passion for campaign reform that is fueled in part because
of the pain of those mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   This is an issue, however, on which it is possible for even the
lowest sinner to get religion. Remember that the patron saint of
campaign finance reform, Sen. John McCain, was tainted in the
Keating Five scandal, a transgression candidate McCain admitted
with the light-heartedness of the lately baptized.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who became a ``reformer with results'' immediately after
McCain beat him in New Hampshire, has advanced his own campaign
finance plan, but he was having nothing to do with a proposal by
Gore to have the national parties eliminate soft-money advertising
in the upcoming campaign.
</P>
<P>
   If it was brazen, Gore's embrace of campaign finance reform was
a predictable turn in a campaign in which Gore has benefited from
the problems McCain has caused Bush, without winning much affection
from McCain's independent-leaning voters.
</P>
<P>
   It would have seemed unlikely last year that Gore might have
reason to worry about peaking too soon at the close of the primary
season. That stretches the situation a little _ while Gore has
gained much ground on Bush, most polls still have him behind.
</P>
<P>
   But the abrupt embrace of McCain's issue was a signal that
Gore's campaign, despite beginning the general election campaign in
better shape than expected, perceives the need to retool quickly
for the next race. With the memory of the GOP divisions still
fresh, Gore lumped Bush together with Pat Robertson and Jerry
Falwell in an answer to a question about abortion.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans in the meantime have been focusing on the effort
to tie Gore and the Clinton administration to the rising gas
prices. This introduces what could be the most unpredictable issue
in the upcoming campaign.
</P>
<P>
   A sharp spike in New England fuel oil prices before the New
Hampshire primary, seemed to have had relatively little impact on
how people voted.
</P>
<P>
   But a big jump in gas prices and the resulting ripple effect on
the national economy could have a much more dramatic impact in the
general election. In the economy, as in the polls, Gore might be
cause for worry in peaking too soon.

RENAULT EXECUTIVE WILL BECOME PRESIDENT OF NISSAN MOTOR  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Carlos Ghosn, the Renault SA executive dispatched to
Japan a year ago to help restore Nissan Motor Co.'s profitability,
will become its president, officials of the struggling Japanese
automaker and its French partner said Thursday. The promotion
represents the first time a foreigner has assumed such a
prestigious role in a major Japanese corporation.
</P>
<P>
   Another senior Renault executive on assignment at Nissan,
Thierry Moulonguet, will become Nissan's chief financial officer as
part of a broader management shakeup, the companies said.
</P>
<P>
   Renault took a 35 percent stake in Nissan last year, and Ghosn,
nicknamed ``Le Cost Killer'' in the French press for his aggressive
record in reducing overhead, became Nissan's chief operating
officer, giving him day-to-day control. The announcements Thursday,
which will become effective at the Nissan shareholders meeting in
June, strengthens Renault's grip on Nissan.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Ghosn, no foreigner has held a top executive position at
a pillar of corporate Japan. While foreigners have served as
president of Mazda Motor Corp., an affiliate of Ford Motor Co.,
Mazda is much smaller than Nissan.
</P>
<P>
   In a Western sense, the titles mean little as both Ghosn and
Moulonguet have effectively been playing those roles within Nissan
already. ``We don't consider this to be such a major event but more
of a natural process,'' said Yoshikazu Hanawa, who relinquished the
president title to Ghosn but remains chief executive and chairman.
</P>
<P>
   But in Japan, where titles confer status and designate authority
and perhaps no title is more coveted than that of the company
``shatcho,'' or president, the announcement's symbolism was
resonant. At a news conference, Hanawa acknowledged the
significance of the title.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we say `shatcho,' there's this insinuated message making
it something like a CEO, so that the shatcho decides on
everything,'' Hanawa said.
</P>
<P>
   He insisted that the decision to transfer the title was his own
and said he had been thinking about it ever since Ghosn arrived at
Nissan. ``In a practical sense, his responsibility was equal to
that of a president,'' Hanawa said.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Ghosn said he was honored to have the title but
spent more time stressing his commitment to returning Nissan to
profitability and competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
   He refused to comment on a report in the evening edition of the
Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Japan's leading business newspaper, that
Nissan's operating profit for the fiscal year ending March 31 would
be a third of the company's earlier forecast.
</P>
<P>
   The management appointments announced Thursday also illustrated
the limits of imposing change on Japanese organizations. There had
been some expectation that Hanawa would announce his retirement,
not merely relinquish a title. By staying, he created a bottleneck
at the top of the company.
</P>
<P>
   That was evident from the reassignment of Kanemitsu Anraku, who
is currently chief financial officer. He will become the company's
vice chairman, a new position, and take charge of external and
government relations.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear what Hanawa's role in the company will be, since
his role after Renault's investment was largely the one Anraku will
now be playing.

   MARKET (New York) _ Investors bought stocks furiously Thursday,
sending the Dow Jones industrial average up nearly 500 points in
its biggest one-day point gain since October 1987. Broader indexes

   NO-INSURANCE-DOCS (Undated) _ A growing number of doctors have
severed their ties to HMOs and insurance companies. In return for
cash payments, the doctors often offer a lavish level of service _
uncrowded waiting rooms, long, uninterrupted office visits, and an
office staff that knows the patients. Nearly a decade after
President Clinton's failed effort to remake health care in America,
the health care market is remaking itself. For those with insurance
or the money to pay for health care, there is evolving a two-tiered
system. One tier is made up of doctors who have cut their prices at
the insistence of health insurers and who make up for the reduced
prices by increasing their volume. The other tier is made up of
those who offer time and attention _ but at a cost. By Lawrence K.

talking about sprawl is easier than limiting it, particularly in

   NKOREA-DIPLOMACY (Tokyo) _ In the space of a short few weeks,
North Korea has gone from one of the world's most politically
reclusive states, to one of the most diplomatically active. With
little fanfare, but with a speed that has surprised many observers
of the Communist country, the government in Pyongyang has
established diplomatic relations with Italy and has resumed
diplomatic discussions with Japan and Australia for the first time
in years. It has also recently sent out discreet feelers to at
least two other major Western nations, Canada and Britain. And

RECLUSIVE NORTH KOREA REACHING OUT TOWARD OTHER NATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By HOWARD W. FRENCH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ In the space of a few short weeks, North Korea has gone
from one of the world's most politically reclusive states to one of
the most diplomatically active.
</P>
<P>
   With little fanfare, but with a speed that has surprised many
observers of the Communist country, the government in Pyongyang has
established diplomatic relations with Italy and has resumed
diplomatic discussions with Japan and Australia for the first time
in years.
</P>
<P>
   It has also recently sent out discreet feelers to at least two
other major Western nations, Canada and Britain. And according to
diplomats in the Philippines, it has approached their country about
joining the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Regional Forum.
</P>
<P>
   Political experts attribute much of this unusually intense
diplomatic activity to a feeling among the North Korean leadership
that they have consolidated their authority and that their
government, which until recently regarded any foreign contact as a
threat, will survive. They also believe recent economic progress
shows that the country's overall direction is promising.
</P>
<P>
   These diplomatic moves are also taking place against the
backdrop of talks between the United States and North Korea that
diplomats say will be crucial to easing the country's isolation and
lowering tensions on the politically divided Korean peninsula, one
of the Cold War's final flash points.
</P>
<P>
   In New York this week, North Korea's deputy foreign minister,
Kim Gye Gwan, and an American delegation led by Charles Kartman
have been discussing final arrangements for high-level talks
between the two countries tentatively scheduled for April in
Washington. No high-ranking North Korean official has visited
Washington since the Korean War ended in 1953.
</P>
<P>
   In September, the Clinton administration lifted some trade,
banking and other sanctions that had been imposed on North Korea
for decades. Now Pyongyang wants Washington to take it off a list
of nations that Washington says support terrorism. Among other
things, the United States reportedly wants North Korea to agree
that it will not resume tests of ballistic missiles like the one it
fired over Japan in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Washington has also sought to encourage Pyongyang to respond
more favorably to the so-called Sunshine Policy of the South Korean
leader, Kim Dae Jung. North Korea has recently accepted limited
forms of investment and tourism from South Korea, but has spurned
offers for direct talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. has been encouraging them to engage with the outside
world,'' said Park Young Ho, a senior research fellow at the Korean
Institute for National Unification, in Seoul. ``And this is
happening at a time when North Korea seems to have realized that it
needs to have more relations with other countries in order to
improve its own situation further.''
</P>
<P>
   Other experts have taken a much more skeptical view of
Pyongyang's opening, saying it is a short-term ploy meant to
minimize the use of North Korea's weapons programs and often
belligerent posturing as campaign themes in important national
legislative elections in South Korea in April, and in the U.S.
presidential election in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``This may be a diplomatic flurry for the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea. But, like they say, they've been down so long it
looks like up now,'' said Nicholas Eberstadt, a North Korea expert
at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington. ``All of the
new diplomacy is with countries that are willing to give
assistance, and it is meant to cover them in case the Washington
scenario doesn't work out.''
</P>
<P>
   But other recent signs of diplomatic activity by North Korea
have involved the country's historic ideological patrons. This
month President Kim Jong Il, paid an unusual visit to the Chinese
Embassy in Pyongyang, at the invitation of the Chinese ambassador,
Wan Yongxiang.
</P>
<P>
   In its only explanation of the visit, the official North Korean
media said Kim ``expressed thanks for the invitation and conversed
with the leading officials of the embassy.'' The visit immediately
set off speculation among North Korea experts that Kim was
preparing to visit China. If so, it would be his first overseas
trip since assuming power after the death of his father, Kim Il
Sung, in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea has also recently signed a new friendship treaty
with Russia.
</P>
<P>
   This ongoing diplomatic activity comes at a time when Kim
believes he is in a strong position politically, despite a sharp
and prolonged economic decline brought on by the disappearance of
its Cold War allies from the Soviet bloc, and by unusually harsh
weather and crop failures that led to famine.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the economy is believed to have grown slightly, for
the first time in a decade. And in a change from his normal diet of
visits to military installations, the 58-year-old North Korean
leader began emphasizing visits to factories and food production
centers.
</P>
<P>
   Now, many experts say Kim appears determined to bring about a
rebound from economic collapse. He has apparently decided that one
of the keys to doing this is through a controlled opening to the
rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   If this is so, there is still considerable divergence among
experts over the economic direction to expect from Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
   Under its Sunshine Policy, South Korea is investing heavily,
both in economic and diplomatic terms, in encouraging its neighbor
to emulate the gradual evolution toward capitalism undertaken by
Communist nations like China and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview, President Kim of South Korea said
Pyongyang had three options before it: war, which would end
disastrously for it; the status quo, which he said has already
proven a dead end, and evolutionary change.
</P>
<P>
   ``This third option, which I believe is the only viable option,
is to follow the example of China and Vietnam,'' Kim said. ``They
have maintained their political systems, while gradually opening up
economically. This is what we, and all of our friends and allies,
want from North Korea, and we are prepared to help them.''

IN TAIWAN, A POLITICAL SPOOF IS PROOF OF POLITICAL FREEDOM 
</HEADLINE>
  (Taiwan Journal) 
(bl) 
 By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan _ ``I have heard the rumors of various rates
being paid to buy votes, and I solemnly declare that this is not an
activity of my party,'' says the man on the screen, who bears an
uncanny resemblance to President Lee Teng-hui.
</P>
<P>
   ``When my party buys votes, it pays a uniform rate,'' says the
character, working himself into an arm-waving frenzy. ``We offer
the fairest deal! No bargaining!''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not right, I didn't mean that!'' he adds a moment
later, capping a deft caricature of the real Lee's penchant for
blurting out things that require, as they say, some later
clarification.
</P>
<P>
   Exuberant elections are evidence of Taiwan's transition from
dictatorship to democracy, but an unsparing and hilarious satire of
the politicians on the air weekday nights on cable television here
may be the ultimate proof.
</P>
<P>
   Performed live and homing in on the day's news, the show also
provides welcome comic relief from the campaign for Saturday's
presidential election, which is understandably driven by weighty
issues of war and peace that have engaged the Taiwanese people in
endlessly earnest conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel that everybody is too up-tight in this election,'' the
show's originator, Bobby Hou, said the other night as his Lee
Teng-hui makeup was being applied. ``Everybody should relax!''
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to test where the breaking point of this new democracy
is,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   In their quest to skewer all the new candidates equally, Hou and
his ensemble say, they have an easy time harvesting satirical
material from the campaign's cant and mudslinging.
</P>
<P>
   The show is called ``An Appointment With the Chairman,'' the
chairman being Lee, who in actuality may derive more power from his
chairmanship of the long-governing Nationalist Party, or
Kuomintang, than from his elected office. While Lee is not himself
a candidate, the specter of his personality and policies pervades
the presidential race and, as portrayed by Hou, it also provides
the show with a comic center.
</P>
<P>
   A veteran comic actor of 35, Hou has mastered the impulsive,
messianic speech, the sometimes rustic mannerisms and the memorable
expressions on the face of Taiwan's president.
</P>
<P>
   Filling out the ensemble are equally piercing impersonators of
the three main candidates, who together with Hou perform sketches
that are only slightly battier than reality.
</P>
<P>
   The three candidate-characters are Vice President Lien Chan, who
in real life is Lee's chosen successor and is never allowed to
forget it; Chen Shui-bian of the Democratic Progressive Party, a
crusading idealist who has been accused of expedient flip-flops
including a retreat from his longtime advocacy of formal
independence for Taiwan; and James Soong, a former Lee protege and
Nationalist star who bolted to run an independent campaign as a
white knight reformer.
</P>
<P>
   Each show is hastily written by a team that draws on the latest
scandals and gaffes. The actors give the script one quick read
together, just before air time, and then they suddenly morph into
their roles.
</P>
<P>
   In Thursday night's show, the Chen Shui-bian character does his
best to dispel the fears dogging the candidate that he will provoke
a war with China, which has threatened to use force to block
Taiwan's independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guarantee that if elected I will not declare Taiwan's
independence,'' the character says, ``At least until my son has
finished his military service.''
</P>
<P>
   A sketch earlier this week captured Lee's tendency to patronize
his candidate, Lien, as well as the rumor-mongering that all sides
have used as a campaign tactic.
</P>
<P>
   Dismissing stories that the seemingly strait-laced and very
married Lien had visited a massage parlor, the Lee character said,
``The Lien Chan I know never went to a massage parlor. When he
wants to find a woman he doesn't need to go to a massage parlor!''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not right, I didn't mean that!'' he continued.
``Anyway, it was a legitimate massage parlor.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lien character, like his real-life counterpart wearing a cap
and golf jacket to counter his image as a rich and aloof man who
was handed all his high positions, sits pathetically grinning and
then says, ``I work very hard all day long _ in an air conditioned
office.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I didn't mean that!'' he adds.
</P>
<P>
   Lampooning leaders this way would land an actor in jail in
mainland China, and until quite recently it was considered over the
top in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Only two years ago, Hou said, he tried a similar political
satire at another network. It was canceled after one episode, he
said, because of objections from the supposedly liberal Democratic
Progressive Party, which partly controlled the network.
</P>
<P>
   He shopped the idea at several other channels until Gala TV, a
local network, agreed and three months ago the nightly skewering
began.
</P>
<P>
   The 45-minute show has a modest but growing number of loyal
viewers, though its ratings remain well below those of the real
nightly news. In a tacit acknowledgment of its popularity, all
three major candidates are showing commercials during the breaks _
and risking the juxtaposition of comic portrayals and the
embarrassingly similar images in their ads.
</P>
<P>
   In another mix with the real world, each night after the initial
scripted skit, Hou and his comrades take live calls from viewers. A
surprising number try to speak sincerely, only to find themselves
teased. When a woman called to say she preferred James Soong for
president, Hou as President Lee answered, ``I guarantee that you'll
get a big tax bill at the end of this month,'' a reference to the
Nationalist Party's alleged habit of abusing government powers and
its legal hounding of the renegade Soong.
</P>
<P>
   Hou said that in previous incarnations he had played Mao
Tse-tung, the founder of Communist China, and Jiang Zemin, China's
current president and Communist Party leader, but Taiwanese were
not much interested. But if China ever does reclaim Taiwan, will he
lampoon Jiang?
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course!'' he replied.
</P>
<P>
   Hou said he hopes to continue with the show after the election,
and it appears that Lee may keep on providing raw material, since
he has expressed his intention to stay on as Nationalist Party
chairman until his term runs out more than a year from now.
</P>
<P>
   That was grist for a sketch this week in which the Lee character
said: ``Ignore those rumors that I'm going to step down as party
chairman. I'm telling you, I'm going to stay forever!''
</P>
<P>
   He paused a second, then continued: ``That's not right. I didn't
mean that!''

RAMSEYS PROMOTE THEIR BOOK AND THEORY AN INTRUDER KILLED THEIR
DAUGHTER  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ After three years of virtual seclusion, John and Patsy
Ramsey have emerged to argue strenuously that they played no role
in the killing of their 6-year-old daughter, JonBenet.
</P>
<P>
   After the planned release on Friday of their book, ``The Death
of Innocence,'' the Ramseys are scheduled to appear in a taped
interview Friday night on ABC's 20/20 and every day next week on
NBC's Today show. In both television appearances, the Ramseys deny
accusations, as they have to investigators, that they killed their
daughter and insist that the murderer is still at large, according
to transcripts of the interviews.
</P>
<P>
   The television appearances and book release also coincide with
public statements by Lou Smit, a Colorado Springs detective working
for the Ramseys, who has granted several interviews recently in
which he reiterated his belief that an intruder, not the Ramseys,
was responsible for JonBenet's death.
</P>
<P>
   While police in Boulder have discounted Smit's theory and say
they are still investigating the killing, the timing of the
interviews around the release of the book has suggested to some
people, including Gov. Bill Owens of Colorado, that the Ramseys are
waging a public relations campaign designed to deflect attention
from themselves as suspects.
</P>
<P>
   JonBenet's parents remain the only named suspects in a case that
has baffled investigators since Ramsey found his daughter's body in
the basement of their Boulder, Colo., home the day after Christmas
in 1996. After dismissing a grand jury that failed to indict anyone
after 13 months of reviewing evidence, Alex Hunter, the Boulder
County district attorney, said last fall that the Ramseys remain
under the ``umbrella of suspicion.'' That has not changed.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to reach the Ramseys, who now live in Atlanta, were
unsuccessful. Telephone messages left with their lawyers, L. Lin
Wood in Atlanta and Hal Haddon in Denver, were not returned. Nor
did Smit's lawyer, Greg Walta, return a call.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Thursday, Hunter declined to speculate why the
Ramseys have suddenly become so visible on television. ``I think
the book, ABC, all this stuff speaks for itself,'' he said, ``and
I'd rather not say more than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Owens has been a harsh critic of the Ramseys for some time. Two
weeks after the grand jury was dismissed, he chastised the couple
for ``hiding'' behind lawyers and advisers and challenged them to
return to Colorado to help investigators solve the case. In a rare
public statement, the Ramseys lashed back at the governor, saying
he was wrong, that they had been entirely cooperative with the
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   In their book, they accused him of making those remarks for his
own political purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Owens took note of the Ramseys' return to public view
and said in an interview: ``What we've got here is an orchestrated
campaign to establish themselves as the true victims of the crime,
rather than JonBenet. For years when it mattered, they wouldn't
talk. Now, you can't quiet them down.
</P>
<P>
   ``And without a doubt, they are deflecting attention from
themselves, pointing a finger to some killer they say laid in
wait.''
</P>
<P>
   Neal Gabler, a cultural historian and author of the 1998 book,
``Life The Movie: How Entertainment Conquered Reality,'' said that
to the Ramseys, public perceptions of their guilt or innocence may
be less important than achieving celebrity and sympathy through a
burst of publicity. By extension, a favorable public rating could
benefit them if the authorities ever charged them in the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the Ramseys are doing here is creating and scripting
their own little film with all the ancillary rights,'' he said.
``They have become stars in their own movie, written in the medium
of life, and as stars do in conventional films, they are exploiting
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to family videotapes that the Ramseys released after
JonBenet's death, showing her as a bouncy cowgirl, singing and
dancing, Gabler added, ``They exploited their daughter before she
died. So it all continues. They want attention.''
</P>
<P>
   From a prosecution perspective, little that the Ramseys say in
the television interviews and book, according to people familiar
with their contents, sheds any light on the killing. Rather, they
convey details of their lives since JonBenet's body was found and
the range of emotions they felt as a consequence of losing a
daughter so young.

CHINA'S SCARE TACTICS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Taiwan's presidential balloting Saturday, the second democratic
election in the 5,000-year history of the Chinese nation, features
three closely matched contenders and one overbearing kibitzer.
</P>
<P>
   The communist regime on the mainland, displaying a stubborn
refusal to honor the democratic principle of the voters' free
choice, has sought to scare the citizens on Taiwan away from one
candidate. Chen Shui-ban of the Democratic Progressive Party has
drawn the wrath of the Reds because they do not believe his
statement that, if elected, he will not push for the formal
declaration of independence commended in the platform of his party.
</P>
<P>
   The last time Beijing tried to interfere in a presidential
election on Taiwan, in 1996, the voters pondered the mainland's
denunciations of incumbent Lee Teng-hui and reacted by giving him
an overwhelming victory. The arrogance of Beijing's meddling
reflects not merely the communists' incomprehension of democratic
elections but also the degree to which the Chinese have become
intoxicated by their own propaganda. After all, if they believe
Taiwan has never ceased being an errant province of communist
China, then no effort they make to intimidate voters on the island
could qualify as interference in the internal affairs of another
country.
</P>
<P>
   So deeply ingrained is this credo that even the moderate Prime
Minister Zhu Rongji tried at a press conference Wednesday to
frighten Taiwan's voters. ``The people of Taiwan are standing at a
very critical historical juncture,'' Zhu shouted, shaking a finger
in the air. ``So let me give advice to all the people of Taiwan: Do
not act just on impulse. Otherwise you will regret it very much and
it will be too late to repent.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the outcome of Saturday's election, President Clinton
and his successor will have to walk a fine line on the issue of
Taiwan. Washington must be firm enough to deter Beijing from any
rash military action but supple enough to encourage polical
dialogue and the continued development of lucrative commercial
relations between Taiwan and the mainland. China may be unified
when the mainland emulates the democracy of Taiwan.

E-VENTUROUS READING

<TEXT>
<P>
   Join the American Association of Fuddy-Duddies if you are one of
those who can't imagine why anyone would want to suffer the
eyestrain to read Stephen King's new e-book. At 16,000 words,
roughly 64 typewritten pages, the story can be printed out or read
on a computer screen.
</P>
<P>
   Posted this week, King's novella, ``Riding the Bullet,'' has
been so popular that Web sites carrying it collapsed, unable to
handle all the point-and-click demands.
</P>
<P>
   The idea was fascinating. Scribner _ an imprint of Simon &AMP;
Schuster _ and King's press, Philtrum, co-published the work,
posting it on line and charging readers $2.50 for access. This
slashed the traditional year-long publishing cycle, getting readers
to new writing quickly. In addition, special software enables
booksellers with Web sites to get in on the act, becoming e-book
sellers.
</P>
<P>
   This time around the money-making potential is tough to measure,
because some sites, including Amazon.com, are offering the story
for free _ if the server isn't already overwhelmed with requests.
</P>
<P>
   Like most technological change, there are possibilities to cheer
and possibilities to fear.
</P>
<P>
   E-publishing could lead to a renaissance in short fiction. Web
sites could offer a 21st century version of the hospitality that
magazines such as the Saturday Evening Post in its heyday provided
for the likes of F. Scott Fitzgerald and William Faulkner.
</P>
<P>
   With deliberate care and thought, the Internet could grow into
much more than an outlet for fabulously famous writers. Web-readers
could also be exposed to novice voices as well as up-and-comers.
And those less inclined to read books may be more attracted to
reading material that's on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   But fuddy-duddies of the world should unite to defend the art of
books. As sheer physical objects _ with no portals for plug-ins or
add-ons _ books are a delight. The paintings and photographs on
book covers, the design, the typography, even the smell are all
part of reading's vivid impact on the imagination. It would be a
tragedy to lose this physical pleasure in some technological tidal
wave of good intentions.
</P>
<P>
   Let the bookstores and libraries grow to accommodate both good
old books and new e-books.

<P>
   HOPEWELL, N.J. _ Leslie Kramer and her husband moved into a big
Victorian house in this rural township to get away from congestion
in Westchester County, N.Y. Carol Ferry and her husband moved here
from Hamilton Township, on the other side of Trenton, for the same
reason.
</P>
<P>
   So have hundreds of their neighbors who thought that here, at
last, they would be safe from sprawl.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Gov. Christie Whitman had said that she would make
New Jersey a national model for controlling growth in ways that
would protect open space and direct growth back to urban areas.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Governors across the country, including George Pataki of New
York and John Rowland of Connecticut, have more recently done the
same.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But like forest creatures who are too slow to outrun a wildfire,
the Kramers and the Ferrys have found that the crowded old
neighborhoods they tried to flee are on their way to them, led by a
giant new development that could produce more office space than a
tower of the World Trade Center. And when new census figures this
month showed formerly rural parts of New Jersey growing faster than
anyplace in the region, it was a reminder that stopping sprawl and
talking about it are two very different things.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you what I believe _ you can't stop it,'' said
Kramer, the leader of a failed effort to stop Merrill Lynch from
building a project that will start at 3.5 million square feet and
could grow to 5.5 million in an old cornfield here. ``My husband
hit me over the head with that fact all along and I didn't believe
him. I kept saying, `No, this is so wrong on so many levels _ look
what it's doing to our community, look how it violates the State
Plan, look how it goes against everything the governor said she was
going to do!' But you know, he was right. You can't stop it, not if
the people with the money want it.''
</P>
<P>
   If anything, the existence of anti-sprawl measures like New
Jersey's state plan and the governor's fervent calls for protecting
open space may only deepen residents' sense of betrayal when a
project like the one being built by Merrill Lynch here starts
rising in a neck of the state that looks more like Vermont than New
Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   The Hopewell project also demonstrates anew how money and jobs _
in this case the company's threat to move 3,500 jobs to
Pennsylvania _ can trump public land preservation policy.
</P>
<P>
   So whether it is the project here, or the 1 million square feet
of laboratories that AT&AMP;T recently opened in Middletown, Monmouth
County, or the plans to develop 2,000 acres of woods near Stewart
Airport in Orange County, N.Y., sprawl continues to march on across
the region.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Some figures from New Jersey: of the 9.9 million square feet of
office space authorized by local officials through November last
year, nearly two thirds is being built in an outer ring of largely
rural counties of Morris, Somerset, Hunterdon, Monmouth, Mercer and
Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Somerset, the fastest growing county in the New York
metropolitan region, added more than half a million square feet
alone, while Mercer County, home of Princeton and Hopewell and two
hours from Manhattan, leads the state with 2.1 million square feet
of office space authorized last year, much of it from the Merrill
Lynch project.
</P>
<P>
   The Regional Planning Partnership, a non-profit land-use
planning group that studies growth in Mercer, Somerset and
Middlesex counties, forecasts a 40 percent population increase by
2020 in the region. Even more striking than population growth
trends, however, are land use trends. The group said that while the
region's population grew 21 percent from 1976 to 1996, the land
area developed increased by 61 percent. And most of that came
before the area's boom began in earnest.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In her 1998 inaugural address, Whitman announced a $1 billion
open space preservation bond act, to buy up 1 million acres of open
land, and declared, ``We must do more to encourage intelligent,
responsible growth for New Jersey's future, especially in our
cities.'' The bond act was passed by the voters by a wide margin.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In January, Pataki of New York created a Quality Communities
Task Force to study ways to direct growth in ways that emphasize
redevelopment and reduce sprawl. In Connecticut, Rowland has
declared a goal of tripling the amount of land protected from
sprawl in the next 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But such pledges to stem sprawl have come too late for residents
here, who failed to follow the local planning process until it was
too late, said Samuel H. Hamill, Jr. a former local planning board
president and now senior consultant to New Jersey Future, a growth
management think tank. That aloofness from the nitty-gritty of
planning issues, he said, is now ending.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only did the governor's bond act pass, but there were any
number of local elections that turned on these very questions.''
Hamill said.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch had one big factor going in its favor: the land it
company chose was zoned for a big project like the one it wanted to
develop, however incongruous it might seem to someone driving
slowly by on the rural lane that bordered the site. But if the
state had any misgivings, they were erased when Merrill Lynch made
plain that it was going to be Hopewell or another state, probably
an equally rustic corner of Pennsylvania. Whitman, concerned with
the company's threat to pull 3,500 or more jobs from the state,
gave the project political and financial support.
</P>
<P>
   The state applied for and got $38.5 million in federal money to
rebuild the interchange at Interstate 95 and Scotch Road, where the
Merrill Lynch project is being built, and it has agreed to help the
company avoid $13.5 million in sales taxes. In addition, the state
said it would give the company $6.4 million to create at least
1,100 new jobs at the site, which will eventually employ 3,500.
Finally, Merrill Lynch, the country's largest brokerage house, will
get $135 million in grants for job creation at Hopewell and at its
10 other New Jersey sites.

RUSSIA BARS INTERVIEWS WITH CHECHEN REBEL LEADERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Budgeted as Russia-Journalists)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN WHITMORE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Renewing fears that press freedoms are increasingly in
peril, the Kremlin made it illegal this week for Russian media to
quote rebel leaders in their reports on Moscow's war against
separatist guerrillas in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   The government justified the move as part of its ``fight against
terrorism.'' Journalists and free-speech advocates, however, called
it the latest step in an intensifying government crackdown on news
media.
</P>
<P>
   With Russian troops bogged down in Chechnya and presidential
elections less than two weeks away, the Kremlin has become
increasingly intolerant of dissenting voices. Some critics are
saying that under Acting President Vladimir V. Putin, who is widely
expected to win the March 26 vote, freedom of the press and other
hard-won civil liberties may be in peril.
</P>
<P>
   ``Putin and his team are doing everything possible to make sure
that the press isn't free,'' said Oleg Panfilov of the Russian
Journalists' Union. ``They have been waging a campaign to control
the media and this is the latest step in that process.''
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference, however, press minister Mikhail Lesin
said, ``The mass media have no right to give terrorists and people
suspected of terrorism an opportunity to advertise themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The announcement broadened an edict issued the day before that
barred Russian media from quoting Chechnya's president, Aslan
Maskhadov, rebel spokesman Movladi Udugov, and guerrilla commander
Shamil Basayev. Journalists who violate the ban, Lesin said, would
be given two warnings, and the ministry would then begin court
proceedings to close them down.
</P>
<P>
   Panfilov and others said the chief target of the gag order might
be US-funded Radio Liberty, which has infuriated the Kremlin with
witheringly critical coverage of the war.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Radio Liberty's Moscow bureau received a letter from
the ministry demanding that it turn over everything it had
broadcast in the past month. Radio Liberty has aired interviews
with rebel leaders and focused much of its war reporting on high
Russian troop losses and the plight of civilians.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Radio Liberty reporter Andrei Babitsky was detained
in Chechnya by Russian forces. He was released Feb. 29 after a
bizarre six-week ordeal. Russian officials claimed they had turned
Babitsky over to the Chechen rebels in exchange for Russian
prisoners of war, but Babitsky said he was in the hands of Russia's
security services the entire time.
</P>
<P>
   Officials have said Babitsky is under investigation for siding
with the guerrillas and is not allowed to leave Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Savik Shuster, Radio Liberty's Moscow bureau chief, said the
station would continue to give both the Russian military and
Chechen rebels a chance to tell their sides of the story.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not be intimidated. We work in the public interest,
and it is not for the government to decide what we should and
should not report,'' Shuster said. ``When the government starts
telling journalists what to do it means we are living in a very
unhealthy situation. It means that the government is doing
something it should not be doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia has come under intense international criticism for
alleged human-rights violations and large numbers of civilian
casualties in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   While state-run media here have been largely supportive of
Russia's conduct in the war, some privately owned newspapers, radio
and television stations have been more critical.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Clinton administration official, in Moscow for talks,
said he had raised the issue of press freedoms with the Russians.
The official, who spoke on condition he not be identified, said it
was too early to tell whether or not a crackdown on the media was
coming under Putin.
</P>
<P>
   ``The history of freedom of the press in Russia is not that
long. This is a country that has a different attitude about the
balance of order and freedom then we have, and they're struggling
with it,'' the official said.

 HOPEWELL, N.J.: Jersey sites.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Eileen McGinnis, the governor's chief policy adviser, lives in
Hopewell and defends the project, even as she has her own personal
misgivings about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I separate my personal feelings from my professional
feelings,'' McGinnis said. ``On a personal level I drive by it
every day and I do wish the project wasn't there. But on a
professional level I know that the State Plan is not about no
growth, it's about smart growth.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The State Plan, adopted in 1992 as guidelines for directing
growth to areas with transportation access and to already built-up
areas, is often invoked by preservationists for its goal that the
state should use its power to push some new development towards the
state's hollowed-out cities. But the plan's guidelines are
advisory, not mandatory and subject to economic and political
pressures.
</P>
<P>
   The Merrill Lynch site is designated for growth under the State
Plan as an area with public space such as retail and housing.
Critics point out, however, that there is no public component in
the 3.5 million square foot first phase.
</P>
<P>
   The site is designated as a growth area under the State Plan,
because it is adjacent to an interstate highway.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But Jeff Tittle, executive director of the New Jersey Sierra
Club, maintains that by helping Merrill Lynch build on a pristine
rural site, it was working against its own aim of buying land for a
public greenway trail from the Delaware River to Princeton through
Hopewell, since all land in the area will now be made much more
expensive by the immense new development.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Building deep in the country makes perfect sense from the
company's perspective, said Hamill, even though the state might
have wished that the project had gone go to a city like Trenton,
which has acres of unused industrial space, and which lies only a
few miles from Hopewell.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cities in general, and Trenton is no exception, are much
less certain than the suburbs as planning environments,'' Hamill
said. ``Things don't happen as quickly in the cities, buildings
inspections aren't on time and policy plans are much more vague, so
anyone going there has this uncertainty in the approval process.''
</P>
<P>
   When Merrill Lynch told the state that it would build in
Hopewell or leave New Jersey, state officials gingerly raised the
idea of building in Trenton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Merrill Lynch officials said very clearly that they would not
look at Trenton,'' said Tom Dalessio, an assistant in the
governor's policy office. ``They wanted a suburban style campus, so
it was either here or Pennsylvania.''
</P>
<P>
   In Hopewell, Merrill Lynch found 450 acres of open farmland that
had been owned, with development in mind, by Bristol Myers Squibb,
the pharmaceutical concern, since 1955.
</P>
<P>
   It also found a five-member all-Republican town board with
strong land-owner sympathies that welcomed the prospect of millions
of dollars in new taxes for sewers and schools. It did not hurt
that the company also bought 440 additional acres across the road
from William E. Schluter, an influential state senator who sits on
the Economic Growth, Agriculture and Tourism committee.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch has final approval to build 1.3 million square
feet of office space on the land, and has preliminary approval to
build 2.2 million more at the site. The adjacent 440 acres is zoned
for 2 million square feet of commercial development, for a total of
5.5 million square feet potential _ and probable _ construction on
both sides of the road. One World Trade Center tower contains 4
million square feet.
</P>
<P>
   Local reaction followed the now familiar arc from surprise to
anger to despair. An anti-growth coalition swept the Republicans on
the town board and replaced them with a 4-to-1 Democratic majority
that succeeded in stopping Merrill Lynch's preferred sewer option _
it has others _ but could not block the development.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Now Ferry, an office worker, has to wonder if she and her
husband Dennis, a chemist, should think of moving again, to stay
ahead of the wave. When they moved from their starter home in
Trenton to a house in Hamilton in 1978, they had fields behind.
When they left for Hopewell in 1985, she said, the fields in
Hamilton were covered with houses, and a drive that once took ten
minutes took half an hour.

 &HT;    CLINTON: U.S. WILL NOT ACCEPT NUCLEAR PROGRAMS IN INDIA,
PAKISTAN
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (w) Washington categories.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton, preparing for a high stakes
visit to India and Pakistan, warned both countries Thursday that he
would not accept their nuclear weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
   Until those programs are turned back, Clinton said, U.S.
relations with those countries would be hampered.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are those in the region who hope we will simply accept
its nuclear status quo and move on. I will not do that,'' Clinton
said in video-taped remarks he prepared to open a non-proliferation
conference here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   India declared itself a nuclear power after a series of
underground tests in May, 1998. Within weeks, Pakistan exploded its
own series of tests, and the world suddenly had two new nuclear
powers _ and a new level of tension in the Indian subcontinent.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is scheduled to leave Saturday for a week-long swing
through India, Pakistan and Bangladesh. It will be the first
presidential trip to the region since Jimmy Carter visited India in
1978.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he would carry with him a strong message that the
tit-for-tat nuclear arms race on the Indian subcontinent has
reduced security for India and Pakistan, not enhanced it.
</P>
<P>
   ``India and Pakistan have legitimate security concerns,''
Clinton said. ``But I will make clear our view that a nuclear
future is a dangerous future for them and for the world. And I'll
stress that narrowing our differences on nonproliferation is
important to moving toward a broader relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   In response to the nuclear developments, the United States
slapped India and Pakistan with sanctions restricting U.S. economic
and military cooperation. While the sanctions have been eased in
recent months, following pledges by both countries not to undertake
future nuclear tests, they won't be lifted altogether unless and
until additional steps are taken, White House National Security
Adviser Samuel Berger told reporters Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton wants both countries to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban
Treaty, for instance, codifying their pledge to halt weapons tests.
The president has signed the treaty, but the Senate has refused to
ratify it.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also wants India and Pakistan to refrain from actually
deploying nuclear weapons _ so far neither has deployed such arms _
agree not to export sensitive nuclear technology to countries
trying to acquire nuclear weapons capability; and enter into
international negotiations over a new treaty to cut off the
production of nuclear weapons fuel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither side has deployed nuclear weapons, and I think that's
an important step not taken,'' Berger said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are obviously further steps that could be taken that
would de-escalate the level of tension and put these weapons
farther out of reach,'' Berger said. ``As long as they have not met
these steps . . . we can't realize the full potential of our
relationship.''

FUN MOSTLY MISSING FROM `DESTINATION' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SEAN AXMAKER  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was only a matter of time before someone twisted the
spiritual sight of ``I see dead people'' into a teenage body count
spectacle with a metaphysical hook.
</P>
<P>
   Devon Sawa is high school student Alex Browning, a kid who
awakens from a frightful dream with the powers of foresight.
</P>
<P>
   He's on a plane waiting for takeoff when he ``sees'' the flight
explode, but his panicked plea falls on deaf ears as he and a
handful of passengers caught in his fracas are removed from the
flight. When the plane explodes, he's the FBI's top suspect, but
the deaths don't stop there. Seven would-be passengers have cheated
death, and death has a rain check.
</P>
<P>
   Director James Wong and his co-writer Glen Morgan are
``X-Files'' alumni who helped that show perfect its formula of
eerie images of other-worldy suggestion leavened with a hint of
humor. But they start the film off so grim and humorless that the
first half almost sinks into silliness.
</P>
<P>
   The first death, involving toilet bowl cleaner, is farfetched
and mean-spirited. The second is a black joke played for pure shock
effect.
</P>
<P>
   The third ``killing'' is a meticulously constructed sequence
that turns a series of random events into doomed inevitability and
presents it as devilish spectacle.
</P>
<P>
   There's no wisecracking killer, no mysterious supernatural
presence. These kids are up against a confluence of fate, chance
and an absurd skew on the laws of probability. Their only defense
is Alex's visions.
</P>
<P>
   Once the picture settles on its preferred method of execution,
Wong starts to have some fun. Tony Todd (``Candyman'' to horror
movie aficionados) plays an unsettling mortician who whispers
``death has a design.'' The scene is half tongue-in-cheek and Todd
is the only actor in the film who manages to straddle the line
between seriousness and spoof.
</P>
<P>
   When Alex and his glum art-chick girlfriend (Ali Larter)
immediately take his cockeyed philosophy as a literal explanation,
the film falls back into its seesaw tonal shifts, one minute stone
serious, the next playfully goofing.
</P>
<P>
   When it gets the tone right, as it does increasingly toward the
end, ``Final Destination'' is clever and often deviously
entertaining, but ultimately it's all about Wong's imaginative
spectacles from the amusement park of the grim reaper. If the rest
of the film was directed with as much deftness and wit, he might
have another ``Scream'' on his hands. Instead, he'll have to settle
for an appreciative giggle.
</P>
<P>
   Final Destination. Directed by James Wong. Screenplay by Wong,
Glen Morgan and Jeffrey Reddick. Cast: Devon Sawa, Ali Larter,
Seann W. Scott, Kerr Smith, Chad E. Donella. New Line Cinema. 93
minutes. Rated R for violence and language.

`RIGOLETTO' GOES HOLLYWOOD: LA DONNA E MOBILE, BABY 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By DAVID MERMELSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In a city where movies dominate culture, the Los
Angeles Opera has never attained a high profile. Yet rather than
meekly accepting second-class status, the company is forging links
with Hollywood, enticing directors and designers to apply their
skills in its service.
</P>
<P>
   Until now the results of this strategy have been decidedly
underwhelming, with the film director Herbert Ross making the only
substantial contribution to the cross-pollination when he
supervised a conventional staging of ``La Boheme'' in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   But on March 1 the Los Angeles Opera unveiled a new production
of Verdi's ``Rigoletto,'' relocating the action from 16th-century
Mantua to present-day Hollywood. The production, which runs through
Tuesday at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion (home of the opera company
and, frequently, the Academy Awards), is directed by Bruce
Beresford, whose films include ``Breaker Morant,'' ``Driving Miss
Daisy'' and ``Double Jeopardy.''
</P>
<P>
   Changing an opera's time and place is nothing new, of course.
But the Los Angeles Opera's attempt at contemporaneity, an
unapologetic embrace of the movie world, is a bold move.
</P>
<P>
   There is no mistaking the company's intent. In advertisements
for the production, the opera's name is superimposed on a Beverly
Hills street sign. And the program features a contrived plot
synopsis instead of a standard explication of the story.
</P>
<P>
   In Beresford's production the Duke of Mantua, that amoral
playboy whose third-act aria ``La donna e mobile'' rings in
everyone's head, is now Duke Mantua, ``head of a thriving
production company,'' in the words of the program. Rigoletto, the
deformed, smart-mouthed court jester whose cheek begets deadly
consequences, has been turned into a Hollywood agent. The assassin
Sparafucile has morphed into a stuntman.
</P>
<P>
   What has not been changed, purists will be relieved to know, is
Verdi's music and the libretto. Even the supertitles above the
Chandler stage remain true to Francesco Maria Piave's original
text, though opera company officials and Beresford did consider
altering them to match the action.
</P>
<P>
   Beresford, who directed his first opera in 1986, defends the
integrity of his staging. ``I don't think anything's lost,'' he
said. `` `Rigoletto' has been done since 1851, and there have been
so many God-awful conventional productions.'' With sets by John
Stoddart and costumes by Johann Stegmeir, Beresford's production
looks anything but conventional. Stoddart has made the Duke's
sumptuous palace a sparely furnished, ultramodern Hollywood Hills
mansion and has turned the dilapidated inn near which the opera
concludes into a seedy Venice Beach bar. Stegmeir has outfitted the
cast in trendy fashion statements, with the principals wearing
slightly modified Giorgio Armani designs. Hipsters are certain to
recognize the eyeglasses replacing masks in the first act's second
scene; they come courtesy of L.A. Eyeworks, an expensive optical
boutique that counts movie stars among its clients.
</P>
<P>
   On opening night a mix of reactions greeted the production. The
audience, weighted with Hollywood people, seemed delighted by
novelties like a fake swimming pool and dancers boogieing to
Verdi's faux Renaissance strains. The use of a prop cell phone to
convey the exclamation ``Gran nuovo!'' (``Great news!'') also
brought smiles, though the ringing of a real one mid-performance
caused frowns among more traditional operagoers. As the final
curtain fell, scattered boos mingled with loud cheers.
</P>
<P>
   Critical response was also mixed. Writing in Daily Variety, Alan
Rich called the production ``one of the company's few genuine
Verdian triumphs.'' But Mark Swed, chief music critic of The Los
Angeles Times, found the updating imperfect and the production
design ``annoyingly tacky,'' and he was troubled by Beresford's
turning Sparafucile into a ``black thug.''
</P>
<P>
   But the reviews have apparently had little impact on ticket
sales. The eight-performance run is selling very well, the company
said.
</P>
<P>
   More important, the production appears to have registered, at
least to some degree, on Hollywood's radar. The opening-night cast
party (at which the vegetarian buffet was flanked by klieg lights,
director's chairs and outsize film reels) included such actors as
Faye Dunaway and Kyle MacLachlan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love anything that makes something more accessible,'' said
-MacLachlan, repeating a common refrain. Dunaway said, ``It worked
for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   An arguably more discerning encomium came from the veteran
soprano and teacher Phyllis Curtin, in from the East Coast to give
a master class. ``I enjoyed it tremendously and thought it in no
way betrayed the music,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps fearful that the attention focused on this production
might cause some to question the the opera company's professional
seriousness, Peter Hemmings, its general director, is playing down
the Hollywood angle.
</P>
<P>
   ``This production wasn't intended to be a vote-catching thing,''
he said. ``It's an opportunity to shed a new light on a standard
work, and I think we've seized the opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Hemmings, however, has in the past made no secret of his desire
to involve the film world in his company's efforts, not only for
the potentially intriguing artistic results but also with the hope
that Hollywood might bring money to the collaboration, since the
Los Angeles Opera, like most nonprofit arts organizations, depends
on the support of patrons, and new productions almost always demand
underwriting.
</P>
<P>
   Next season the company will have a new artistic director,
Placido Domingo, and he is already talking about courting film
people. ``We have to be very much connected with the world of
Hollywood,'' he said recently.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to reviving Ross' ``Boheme,'' Domingo has engaged
the film director John Schlesinger (``Midnight Cowboy,'' ``The Next
Best Thing'') to direct Benjamin Britten's ``Peter Grimes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I plan on involving the studios, too,'' Domingo said. ``In a
city so connected to the movies, it will be a nice marriage.''

CRASHING BAD WEEK FOR CORDOVA

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRADENTON, Fla. _ Life in limbo was not supposed to be this
hellish.
</P>
<P>
   Marty Cordova Thursday morning was angry, vexed, and perplexed,
but he also was still a member of the Red Sox, the team that
doesn't want him. ``I don't know what's going on,'' Cordova had
said of his descent into baseball limbo.
</P>
<P>
   And then, a few hours later, Cordova was laid out on the grass
behind third base, players and coaches first signaling for a
stretcher after a three-way chase for the popup among Cordova,
shortstop Nomar Garciaparra, and third baseman John Valentin in the
fourth inning of the game with the Pirates. Cordova and Garciaparra
had collided.
</P>
<P>
   Valentin, Garciaparra and Cordova all were on the ground as the
collective breaths of the Red Sox were held. Valentin got up first,
then Garciaparra, but Cordova remained on the grass.
</P>
<P>
   In time, Cordova was able to get to his feet. The Red Sox and
Pittsburgh trainers accompanied Cordova to nearby Manatee Memorial
Hospital, where X-rays of his ribs proved negative. Cordova was
released from the hospital just in time to catch the Red Sox buses
heading back to Boston's headquarters in Fort Myers.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Garciaparra) got me in the side of the ribs,'' said Cordova
before stepping on the bus, ``but I'll be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was running for the ball, you know?'' said Garciaparra. ``I
saw (Cordova) and I looked at him and I saw his hat fly off but I
thought I maybe had a chance for the ball. I knew I'd hit him
pretty good. I looked down and it wasn't pretty. I was scared.''
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra's right knee _ the knee he'd strained earlier in
camp _ had hit Cordova ``and I got something square with me knee,''
said the shortstop, still distraught an hour after the play. ``When
I looked down, I looked at him. I wanted to see his face right
away. His head was down and I was kind of worried about that . . .
I got him right in the ribs.''
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra, who said he was unhurt, said ``You don't like to
see anybody get hurt like that. You don't like to see one of your
teammates go down like that. You don't want anybody to get hurt.
You're scared.''
</P>
<P>
   As Valentin reconstructed the play, ``The wind was blowing
pretty hard, and I really thought the popup was just a little in
back of me. But it kept going and it hung up there and I really
didn't have a shot at it. Nomar and Marty were going after it . . .
it was like no-man's land there, and both were being aggressive for
the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   So, a truly weird scenario had played out Thursday because
Cordova, officially sent into limbo by general manager Dan Duquette
Tuesday, appeared in Bradenton, put on a Red Sox uniform, and was
promptly put in the starting lineup by manager Jimy Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``C'mon on the trip,''' Williams said he told Cordova Thursday
morning in Fort Myers, as Cordova tried to regain his bearings
after the Red Sox had failed to put him on their major league
roster. ``C'mon on the trip and I'll play you in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Cordova suited up, hacked his swings in BP and took his position
in left field against the Pirates, even though the Red Sox
Wednesday had chosen not to assign him to their major league
roster. Under the contract Cordova had signed with Boston in
January, the Red Sox had until March 15 to assign him to their
major league roster or Cordova would be free to make a deal
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Which his agent energetically had been trying to do since
Wednesday morning. And a Yankees scout was busily writing notes
during Boston's game Thursday at McKechnie Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said they weren't ready to make a deal yet,'' Cordova
said before the game of his decision to once again put on a Red Sox
uniform, ``so I decided my best choice was to remain here.''
</P>
<P>
   And play the game.
</P>
<P>
   Alas.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth inning, with the gusts blowing straight out,
Pittsburgh already leading, 13-6, behind six home runs, John Vander
Wal lifted a high pop behind third base. Popups and fly balls
already had been adventuresome in the swirling wind, especially to
Red Sox center fielder Michael Coleman, but this time Cordova,
Valentin and Garciaparra had a bead on the ball, until . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``If something comes up, I've got to do the best for me,''
Cordova had said. ``They pretty much said they're going to go
day-by-day with me, so now I've got to look out for myself. I
understand that I'm still a Boston Red Sox, but also I'm a person,
too, and I've got to do what's best for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, Cordova had been asked if he might try extra
hard to make an impression on the Red Sox. His words in the morning
belied his extra effort in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's little point in trying to make an impression now, or
putting on a power display, said Cordova. ``Anybody who knows me
knows I'm going to hit 15 or 20 home runs a year, and that I'm
going to drive in runs _ I've always been good in driving in runs.
I always like to get up there with runners in scoring position and
I always hit well then.''
</P>
<P>
   Cordova was only winding up.
</P>
<P>
   ``They knew what they were getting when they talked to me in the
offseason,'' he went on. ``It wasn't as if I come out here and I
hit 15 home runs, they're getting Mark McGwire. That's not the way
it is. They know the type of player I am. They know I can play
several positions in the outfield, They know I can steal bases. I
can DH. They know I can play defense in the outfield. They know the
role.''
</P>
<P>
   And now Cordova delivered.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I went out (Thursday) and hit four home runs, I don't think
tomorrow they'd say, `Ohmygosh, we've got Mark McGwire.''' No, said
the outfielder, it'd make no difference if he went 0 for 4 or
4-for-4, ``they already know what they've got.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is a hustling, aggressive outfielder who gave his all for
a team that didn't want him a day earlier. And found himself in a
Bradenton hospital.

   NEW YORK _ The Nikko firs rose 70 feet over our heads, their
soft needles and elegant branching more suggestive of a mountain on
the coast of Japan than the rivers of traffic around their home at
the New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx. But this rare stand of
30 trees, which includes a few American and Mediterranean firs, is
in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were planted in the '20s, when precipitation and
temperature were very different,'' said Dr. Kim Tripp, the
botanical garden's vice president for horticulture. ``And we didn't
have as much pollution.''
</P>
<P>
   The trees are suffering the effects of summers of high heat and
drought, and winters with temperatures rising and falling like a
roller coaster. These shallow-rooted firs can't reach deep into the
earth for moisture during a drought. And when temperatures rise
suddenly in winter, the trees begin photosynthesizing and losing
water from their thousands of flat needles. Their roots try to draw
moisture from the soil, but the ground is frozen, so the trees dry
out. Add to that the pollutants of city life, and, well, these firs
are on shaky ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seeing this skyline of firs in New York City is just
amazing,'' said Tripp, who earned her doctorate at North Carolina
State University in Raleigh. ``But if something happened tomorrow,
we could never replace them.''
</P>
<P>
   She was referring to something like the ill wind that felled
10,000 trees in Versailles, France, last year. Even if new firs
were planted, she said, they wouldn't thrive under today's
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Tripp, who is partial to conifers, cone-bearing trees, led the
way through the 40-acre collection, noting how it fans out ``like a
skirt around the conservatory,'' ad contains specimens rare even
in Japan. Many of the trees were artfully planted over the rocky
hills 100 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they have a certain persistence and stateliness,''
Tripp said, standing by a towering Himalayan pine with long soft
needles. Conifers are ancient plants, which evolved to withstand
the wind, intense light and poor soil of high elevations. Plants
with needles conserve more moisture than those with broad leaves,
which turn their stomata toward the sun. (Stomata are microscopic
holes that allow the exchange of carbon dioxide, oxygen and
moisture.)
</P>
<P>
   Conifers also conserve energy by not replacing their canopy
every year. ``They're a mutual fund kind of tree, rather than a
Nasdaq kind of tree,'' Tripp said.
</P>
<P>
   We walked toward a grove of five tanyosho pines, their
red-orange multistem trunks and spreading branches kindled with the
fiery light of the setting sun. Then we stood among them, almost
mesmerized by their gracious spacing, 20 feet from one another. It
was like music.
</P>
<P>
   ``These trees are the most extraordinary in the country,'' Tripp
said. ``Even in Japan, a grove of this distinction would be highly
revered.''
</P>
<P>
   A single Pinus bungeana, or lacebark pine, stands at the grove's
edge, its mottled green, gray and white bark a stark contrast to
the red pines.
</P>
<P>
   ``As it gets older, it will turn completely white,'' Tripp said.
``It glows like a ghost in the moonlight.'' This tree, planted in
1909, is now threatened in the wild, so it, too, is a living
treasure.
</P>
<P>
   As winter tumbles into spring, the conifer collection will
provide a dramatic backdrop for early bloomers like the kobus
magnolia, which nestles in a protected depression in the hill just
south of the conservatory. Its great open shape shows the benefits
of years of judicious pruning, and its branches spread 35 feet
across. Right now, they are loaded with big fuzzy gray buds, which
have swelled in warm days. Let's hope that a sudden freeze doesn't
turn their velvety petals to brown rags.
</P>
<P>
   If you hurry, you may see the sprawling granddaddy of a witch
hazel, Hamamelis mollis, still blooming. Its dangling yellow
ribbons look like bursts of light against the firs' dark curtain of
green needles.
</P>
<P>
   Tripp trudged energetically up the hill across from the
conservatory to show off the fine old cherry trees, which are still
dark silhouettes of black trunks and bare limbs, surrounded by
somber black pines.
</P>
<P>
   ``They bloom before the leaves come out,'' Tripp said. ``So you
have all this floral extravagance next to the reserve of the pines.
I just want to run up and kiss them.'' The design, laid out 100
years ago, with just that achingly exquisite moment in mind, is
still working.
</P>
<P>
   Tripp fell in love with botanical gardens as a student at North
Carolina State, where her mentor, J.C. Raulston built an arboretum
on a shoestring and the labor and passion of his horticulture
students.
</P>
<P>
   They wrote a book together, ``The Year in Trees: Superb Wood
Plants for Four-Season Gardens'' (Timber Press, 1995), and Tripp is
continuing the Raulston tradition of propagating rare plants and
getting them into the trade.
</P>
<P>
   She hopes to propagate specimen trees, like the great Korean
white pine, which rises 30 feet, with branches twisting this way
and that like a dancer on a windswept hill.
</P>
<P>
   If you have ever wondered why pines twist and turn the way they
do, it has to do with the growing tips turning toward light. If
something blocks that light, like a building or growing plant, the
branch turns in another direction.
</P>
<P>
   And if you can't tell the difference between a fir and a spruce,
just try to roll a fir needle between your fingers. You can't.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's flat,'' Tripp said. ``Just remember `firs' and `flat.'''
A spruce needle, on the other hand, rolls easily between the
fingers. And its cones hang down, while a fir tree's cones stand
up. Though the firs here, alas, have no cones, which is an ominous
sign of their distress.
</P>
<P>
   Tripp is a born teacher _ she came to the Bronx from Smith
College, in Northampton, Mass., where she taught plant science and
public garden administration, and directed the college botanic
garden _ so if you bump into a beaming woman worshiping the
tanyosho pines at sunset, she will no doubt show you something.
Like how the fine needles of these red pines look like filigree
lace full of tiny cones when you stand beneath them and look
straight up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's quite a tough landscape tree,'' she said. ``And if you
plant one, you can experience some of that beauty in your own
garden.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't let these big specimens discourage you from trying them in
your own little backyard.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have a small garden and would like a paperback maple,
then you should have it, as long as you have enough light,'' Tripp
said. ``If it's no longer appropriate 15 years from now, you can
donate or sell it to a nursery.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the garden, we could see the firs rising over the tops of
all the other trees, and I wondered how long they would survive the
ravages of a hotter, drier climate and the polluted city. So go see
them now, before they are just a memory.

CLINTON SEEKS EXTENSION IN ARKANSAS ETHICS COMPLAINT
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton asked a special lawyers committee
in Arkansas Thursday to grant him an extension until after he
leaves office to respond to an ethics complaint that could cost him
his law license in his home state.
</P>
<P>
   The deadline for Clinton to respond to the complaint was
Thursday. Under state rules, Clinton was required to seek an
extension or respond to the complaint from a federal judge and a
conservative legal group asking that the bar group consider some
kind of punishment for what they asserted was his dishonesty under
oath about his relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's lawyer, David Kendall, said in a brief statement that
he had asked the Arkansas Supreme Court Committee on Professional
Conduct to extend the deadline until Feb. 19 of next year, 30 days
after the president leaves office. Kendall said the filing was made
under seal and he would have no further public comment.
</P>
<P>
   The law provides for a possible extension of up to 90 days,
making the president's request for a delay of nearly a year highly
unusual.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew J. Glavin, the president of the Southeastern Legal
Foundation, which filed one of the original complaints, said he
would challenge the request for such a long delay, both with the
lawyers committee and, if necessary, at the state Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Howard Brill of the University of Arkansas Law School
at Fayetteville, the leading authority on how lawyers are
disciplined in Arkansas, said several factors could persuade the
committee to grant the extension.
</P>
<P>
   He said lawyers have their licenses suspended or revoked mainly
to protect the public from unscrupulous lawyers with active
practices in Arkansas. Clinton has not practiced law in Arkansas
for many years.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Brill said, the case against Clinton is based entirely
on the record of his testimony and public statements, which means
there is no issue of a need to move quickly to prevent witnesses
from having their memories fade or because evidence might become
harder to obtain.
</P>
<P>
   The case involves Clinton's statements under oath on Jan. 17,
1998, when he gave a deposition in the sexual misconduct lawsuit
brought by Paula Jones. In the presence of Judge Susan Weber
Wright, who was presiding over the civil lawsuit, Clinton said he
had never engaged in a sexual relationship with Lewinsky, a
one-time White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   Although Clinton has continued to insist his answer was legally
accurate, Wright strongly disagreed and ruled that he was in civil
contempt of court. She said the president had subverted the rule of
law and violated Jones' right to information in her civil rights
lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Wright referred the matter to the Arkansas bar committee last
April but the case remained dormant until Glavin's group filed a
second complaint and asked the state Supreme Court to order the
committee to move on the complaints.
</P>
<P>
   In January, the Arkansas Supreme Court ordered the committee to
move on the complaint.
</P>
<P>
   Brill said the January ruling in which the court ordered the
committee to get on with it may make it difficult for its members
to grant the long extension that Kendall is seeking.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, a Yale Law School graduate, is still licensed to
practice law in Arkansas and still holds Arkansas Bar
identification number 78019 although he has spent most of his adult
life in politics. Whatever penalty might be imposed might be mostly
an embarrassment rather than a hindrance to his employment after he
leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Kendall's statement that the president is seeking
an extension to file a response shows that he will not easily
surrender his license as some have speculated.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In an interview, Glavin said, ``This request is outrageous and
unreasonable.''
</P>
<P>
   Glavin said Clinton was asking that the public interest be set
aside for his convenience.
</P>
<P>
   The arguments about the delay are similar to those in which
Clinton sought to have the Jones lawsuit delayed until after he
left office only to have the U.S. Supreme Court rule that he could
not do so.
</P>
<P>
   In its unanimous ruling, the court said the Jones lawsuit would
probably not take up too much of his time. As the lawsuit led to
the discovery of Clinton's relationship with Lewinsky and
ultimately to the impeachment battle, that ruling has since been
widely criticized.

TROUBLED ONLINE GROCERY PIONEER CONSIDERING PUTTING ITSELF ON
MARKET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Minn., Mass.)  (rk) 
 By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   After nine money-losing years in the online grocery business it
pioneered, Peapod Inc. Thursday appeared ready to pack it in.
</P>
<P>
   The company announced that its 46-year-old chief executive and
president, Bill Malloy, who had been hired from AT&AMP;T's wireless
division less than six months ago, would be leaving for unspecified
health reasons. Then a group of investors who had promised to put
$120 million into the company said they would not be doing so,
given the departure of Malloy.
</P>
<P>
   And the company said it had asked its investment bank,
Wasserstein Perella &AMP; Co., to explore ``strategic alternatives,''
including a sale.
</P>
<P>
   It was a dramatic shift for Peapod, whose co-founder and chief
technology officer, Thomas Parkinson, is shown in a photograph on
the company's Web site dressed in a green peapod costume. The
company, which is based in Skokie, Ill., and had $51.6 million in
sales during the first half of last year, would not elaborate on
its statement, and a spokeswoman refused to say what Malloy's
illness or symptoms were.
</P>
<P>
   Shares in Peapod, which began trading at $16 apiece when the
company went public in June 1997, fell more than 50 percent
Thursday to close at $3.72. The company said its chairman, Andrew
Parkinson, who founded the company with his brother, would step
into the role of chief executive. In addition, two board members,
Drayton McLane and Mark Van Steklenburg, will assist him, the
company said.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which invested in bright green Volkswagen Beetles
that it christened ``Pod Bugs'' to help market itself, has just $3
million in cash, it disclosed Thursday, and may seek alternative
financing to replace the $120 million that was pulled out. Apollo
Management was one of the companies that had promised Peapod an
investment, but changed its mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you lose a significant player like Bill was, there
certainly would be some nervous investors,'' said George S.
Dahlman, an analyst for US Bancorp Piper Jaffray in Minneapolis,
who called Malloy ``a sparkplug'' who fit in well at Peapod. ``This
group was about to buy half the company.''
</P>
<P>
   The company was a pioneer in what has proved to be a tricky
business. Consumers, while they say they want convenience, have
been slow to embrace the concept of buying groceries on the
Internet. Peapod and its competitors, which include Webvan,
Netgrocer and Streamline, have encountered obstacles in figuring
out how to get those groceries delivered without having them melt
or run into other unappealing developments. Solutions have ranged
from relying on Federal Express to installing refrigerators in
customers' garages.
</P>
<P>
   A few large grocery chains intend to start their own online
services, mainly as a means of prying market share away from other
bricks-and-mortar rivals, and that is expected to put further
pressure on smaller players. Recently, Peapod had reorganized
itself and switched from relying on supermarkets to fill their
customers' orders to relying on their own warehouses, said David
Cooperstein, an online retail analyst for Forrester Research in
Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Evie Black Dykema, another analyst for Forrester, said she did
not think Peapod's experience would mean the continued decline of
the online grocery business. ``As more consumers start using the
service, it will drive density, which lowers the incremental costs
to each consumer,'' she said. And once demand reaches critical
mass, online retailers will raise prices for brand-name products,
improving their own margins, and start emphasizing private-label
competitors, she added.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, many companies are working on solutions to the
problem of how to deliver groceries to customers who are away from
home all day, without anyone else around to accept the packages.
``There are a number of options emerging, like satellite-controlled
garage doors that will open for particular retailers, and
unattended delivery boxes on front lawns,'' Dykema said. ``If all
Americans had doormen, we wouldn't have this issue.''

perhaps for many months, because Nasdaq computer systems are

 &HT;    Pitino really needs a string of victories
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   They're an interesting pair, Lenny Wilkens and Rick Pitino, the
former on track for perhaps his worst record in 27 years as an NBA
coach, the latter, trying to gird a young team for an uphill run at
the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   In his seventh year as coach of the Hawks, Wilkens has been
unable to win with the assortment of players Pete Babcock gave him
in a rebuilding year.
</P>
<P>
   In his third year as coach of the Celtics, Pitino is trying to
win with the latest crop of young talent he brought in as president
of the franchise.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkins' team is 24-39, 12 defeats shy of his worst two seasons
ever and has dropped nine of 11 in a town where interest has always
been a sometime thing. The Hawks are in lottery land and every
beating brings them a small step closer to a higher draft choice.
</P>
<P>
   Pitino's bunch has won four of its last five and at 28-36 sits 2
1/2 games behind No. 8 Orlando. But the Celtics tonight take the
first step on a 19-day path that has them playing nine of 11 games
away from Fleet Center. At 6-25 on the road, a victory tonight is
mandatory if the Celtics are going to show they mean business.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have to do it on the road and we're a
tremendous home team,'' Pitino noted after the Celtics creamed
Golden State, 121-104, Tuesday in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be our key to decide whether we go to the
playoffs,'' forward Paul Pierce added. ``Starting Friday is the big
test for us and we haven't been doing it on the road all year long,
but somehow we have to pull it out. It's gut-check time for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics have not been to the playoffs since 1995 when they
were eliminated by Orlando in the first round. In his third season,
Pitino is only 83-113 in Boston, 14 games under .500 in five years
as an NBA coach after winning 74 percent of his college games at
Boston U., Providence and Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   Once, this was Pitino's time of year - ``the greatest month in
all of basketball.'' He took Providence to the NCAA semifinal in
1987, took Kentucky to the national semifinal game before losing in
overtime to Michigan in 1993, won the championship with Kentucky in
1996, lost the championship game to Arizona (with Jason Terry) in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   But recruiting in college was easier for Pitino than drafting,
trading and free agent signings. With the Celtics it's been one
step forward, two back. Yes, Antoine Walker and Paul Pierce are
gems. But he could not recruit Tim Duncan and missed him when the
Spurs scored a lottery upset and pulled No. 1 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   And look at the missteps: drafting Chauncey Billups with the
third pick overall in 1997; trading his other 1997 first-rounder
Ron Mercer (No. 6 overall) last August for Eric Williams
(previously a Pitino discard) and Danny Fortson. How about $30-plus
million for Vitaly Potapenko, $8 million to Walter McCarty, $24
million for Chris Mills before dumping him in New York?
</P>
<P>
   A lot of games, not much fun for Pitino, whose relationship with
owner Paul Gaston has deteriorated as his relationship with Celtics
fans cooled, long before he lectured the city about it's
``negativity.''
</P>
<P>
   But at a time when Atlanta is hearing the unfounded and
unwarranted rumor of Tubby Smith, Pitino is dealing with silly talk
in Beantown. Understand the Celtics still owe him $29 million over
the next seven years (three as coach, four as president), so you
know he's not going away. Know that the balance of his contract is
due in full with a few days if he's fired and you know the Celtics
aren't even thinking about running him out.
</P>
<P>
   Here's where Pitino enjoys another edge on Wilkens who has $10.4
million on his contract. That translates to a little less
protection.

 &HT;    UConn, Vols gear up for tourney
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pat Summitt of Tennessee and Connecticut's Geno Auriemma tried
to make the case this week that their respective routes to the
Final Four may not be as easy as they're perceived.
</P>
<P>
   The two programs that have won four of the last five national
championships are once again at the top of the heap as the NCAA
Tournament begins today.
</P>
<P>
   But neither team made the Final Four last year. UConn hasn't
been there since 1996, and Tennessee's bid for four straight NCAA
crowns came up short in the Elite 8.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why these are the three greatest weeks in sports,''
Auriemma said. ``You better bring your 'A' game with you just in
case the other team brings theirs.''
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies (30-1), No. 1 all season, shouldn't have to worry
about that tonight against Hampton in the East Regional.
Second-ranked Tennessee (28-3), the top seed in the Mideast, gets
underway Saturday against Furman.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a lot of competition, anything can happen,'' said
Summitt, whose team wouldn't have to go out of state to reach the
Final Four. ``Right now, our goal is just to be in Memphis (site of
the Mideast Regional).''
</P>
<P>
   UConn and Tennessee split two regular season games that
generated solid television ratings. And because the Final Four
regional pairings aren't determined until after the 64-team bracket
is drawn up, there's plenty of anticipation that they could meet
for the national championship in Philadelphia on April 2.
</P>
<P>
   So where does that leave everyone else? A Philadelphia Inquirer
columnist recently described Georgia and Louisiana Tech, the other
top seeds and in the national elite for more than 20 years, as
``lesser giants.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Georgia's a great example,'' said coach Tara VanDerveer of
Stanford, whose team could face the Lady Bulldogs in the second
round. ``Sometimes it seems like they're totally in the shadows.
They were in the Final Four last year, not UConn or Tennessee. If
there's anyone who could feel put out, it would be Andy
(Landers).''
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia coach says he doesn't care. Nor was he surprised
when Tennessee bumped the Lady Dogs out of the No. 2 ranking in the
writers' poll after edged UConn 72-71 in February, only two weeks
after Georgia crushed the Lady Vols by 27 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``It falls into that group of things you have no control over,''
Landers said. ``Sometimes you guys (the media) feed that monster.''
</P>
<P>
   And that two-headed monster that emerged when UConn toppled
Tennessee in the 1995 NCAA finals has been slow to embrace other
teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's up to the rest of us to get it done on the court,''
VanDerveer said.

 &HT;    Masters eligibilty losing its luster, players say
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Something's definitely missing from this year's Masters, and the
PGA Tour players aren't happy about it.
</P>
<P>
   Augusta National no longer invites all PGA Tour tournament
winners from the previous Masters. Instead, it takes the top 50
from the controversial and often-confusing Official World Rankings
and the top 40 from the previous PGA Tour money list.
</P>
<P>
   That's why you won't see 1999 tournament winners Brad Faxon,
Olin Browne, Rich Beem, J.L. Lewis, Tom Pernice Jr. and Brian
Henninger at Augusta National on April 6-9.
</P>
<P>
   With the conclusion of the Doral-Ryder Open on March 5, the
Masters field was set, although another invitation could come from
The Players Championship if that winner is not in the field.
</P>
<P>
   Players say the change, in its first year, has taken some of the
luster from one of golf's most prestigious events. Golf's March
Madness is gone, and with it, the dramatics. Davis Love III won the
weekend before the Masters in New Orleans in 1995 in his final
attempt to make the field; he finished second behind Ben Crenshaw
at Augusta.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Paul Stankowski won the BellSouth Classic in Atlanta;
on the next day, he drove down Magnolia Lane, walked on the course
and scooped sand from an Augusta National bunker as a souvenir.
</P>
<P>
   ``You talk to any player who's won his first tournament,'' Billy
Andrade said, ``and the first thing they say is, 'I'm going to
Augusta.' It was great for the Masters, and, in essence, it helped
build the aura of the Masters.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think,'' Love said, ``this is was one time when (the Masters
committee) followed along when they probably shouldn't have. I was
shocked when they did it.''
</P>
<P>
   Faxon recalls getting caught up in Love's 1995 run to Augusta.
</P>
<P>
   ``The saddest thing to me is, the drama of the remaining few
weeks is really gone,'' Faxon said, ``and I think it's something
that gave the Masters positive press. I'm sure that when Davis won
at New Orleans to get in the Masters, that was one of the top
stories of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   The players say that winning does not seem to matter as much as
it used to. The world rankings are such that nobody really knows
where they stand. Two weeks ago at Doral, No. 48 Paul Azinger
actually helped his Masters case by not playing. Had he made the
cut and finished in the middle of the pack, he might have dropped
out of the top 50.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the top 50 is a pretty good indication of who's played
well over the last two years,'' Nick Price said, ``but I still
think the tournament winners (from the PGA Tour) should get in. I
think they're just worried about getting too big of a field there
(at Augusta), and I'm not quite sure why.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't think it's right,'' John Daly said. ``You win on
our tour, you deserve to play in the Masters. It was always cool to
see who was going to win New Orleans, who was going to get in the
Masters. Now Atlanta's there, but now it doesn't matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the eligibility changes hit Atlanta hard. The BellSouth
Classic at Sugarloaf, which swapped its pre-Masters weekend date
with New Orleans, spent only last year as the final qualification
chance for the Masters. The BellSouth was played the week before
the Masters in 1996 because of the Atlanta Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great subplot,'' said Peachtree City's Franklin
Langham, who would not have made the Masters had he held his
back-nine lead at Doral two weeks ago. ``I don't understand why
they did it. You're really not talking about that many guys. I know
this -- they could have kept that money in New Orleans when Davis
won. He just wanted to play Augusta.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrade said he told Masters chairman Hootie Johnson last year
that he loved the course changes but hated the eligibility switch.
``I think that on our tour, which is the hardest tour in the world
to play, you should be rewarded by winning a tournament,'' Andrade
said.
</P>
<P>
   Andrade said Johnson told him the Masters Committee would look
into the possibility of revisiting the old qualification.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, they're inviting (amateur) Aaron Baddeley from
Australia for winning one tournament (the Australian Open),''
Andrade said. ``I don't know what kind of a field they had there,
but I know that when Phil Mickelson won the Tucson Open (in 1991 as
an amateur), he didn't get any special treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just seems to be they're not taking care of our players. I
think all the changes made favor the international players.''
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to understand a field that excludes winners of
PGA Tour events while accepting the U.S. Mid-Amateur and U.S.
Public Links champions and the loser of the U.S. Amateur.
</P>
<P>
   ``Am I bitter? No,'' said Faxon, who has five top-25 finishes at
Augusta in eight apperances. ``Am I disappointed? Yeah. The Masters
is my favorite tournament, and I'd love to be there.''

GORDON AND LOOMIS FEEL THE PRESSURE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By PATRICK ZIER   The Ledger, Lakeland, Fla.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The pressure to win is on Jeff Gordon this year, which means the
pressure is also on Robbie Loomis and everybody else who has
anything to do with Gordon's No. 24 Chevy.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since former crew chief Ray Evernham left late last season
to take over the Dodge program, Gordon has been in free fall. That
has added credence to Gordon's detractors, who have always
maintained it was the car _ not the driver _ that won all those
races and three Winston Cup championships before Gordon reached his
28th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Evernham has always defended Gordon, saying he is one of the
best, if not the best, drivers in NASCAR, but Gordon has done
little to prove him right since he and Evernham split.
</P>
<P>
   It can be argued that Gordon has not fallen off, but his
equipment has. He has had a host of mechanical problems since
Evernham left. The reliability once built into Gordon's cars seems
to have left along with Evernham.
</P>
<P>
   Last Sunday at Atlanta Motor Speedway, the Chevys were given a
rule concession by NASCAR which allowed them to extend the front
air dam two inches out from under the bumper. The Chevys seemed to
have better downforce and dominated the race. Gordon came in ninth
_ his best finish of the year _ and might have been able to
challenge Dale Earnhardt for the win had he not lost a lap when he
was forced to pit because of a blistered tire.
</P>
<P>
   When the race was over, Gordon said he thought he was as fast as
anybody at the end, which was a much needed boost for him and
perhaps even a bigger boost for Loomis, who has taken over as
Gordon's crew chief.
</P>
<P>
   In somewhat of a surprise move, Loomis, who had been running
Richard Petty's two-car operation, left to jump into the fire at
Hendrick Motorsports, where Evernham and Gordon had teamed to
dominate NASCAR in the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, who did not start driving in Winston Cup until 1993,
accumulated 49 victories in just seven years, tied for 10th
all-time with Rusty Wallace and won those three Winston
championships. Only two drivers in history, Petty and Earnhardt,
have won more than three championships in their career.
</P>
<P>
   When Evernham left, Loomis was brought in to continue the roll,
but it was a daunting task. Loomis understands that, having taken
over at Petty Enterprises just before Petty, the winningest and
best-known driver in NASCAR, decided to retire.
</P>
<P>
   As with Gordon now, there was immense pressure on Loomis to help
Petty Enterprises return to the domination of Petty's golden years,
and Loomis got the team headed in the right direction, although the
operation is still not where it wants to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pressure to win is always there,'' Loomis said. ``I don't
worry about what the expectations are.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that's surprised me is how similar Richard and Jeff
are in the way they treat people,'' Loomis said, referring to Petty
and Gordon. ``They both treat people right.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Another thing that surprised me is how much he knows about the
race car,'' Loomis said of Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a good feel for how the car handles. He doesn't come in
and say we need to change the springs. He'll come in and say we
need to change the spring on the right front,'' Loomis said.
</P>
<P>
   If Gordon's slump has done nothing else, it has destroyed the
image many have of him as a spoiled brat.
</P>
<P>
   For those who have been able to observe him, Gordon has handled
his situation with class. He does not blame anybody, and he has
backed Loomis and team manager Brian Whitesell, who has gone back
to focusing on improving the cars after a brief stint as crew
chief, to the hilt.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a chance to help build a team again, and I enjoy
that,'' Loomis said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like working with people. I learned how to do that working
with Petty,'' Loomis said. ``This team's used to being on top.
We'll get back up there.''

PROWLING CYBERSPACE'S USED-CAR LOTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: 2nd take consists of optional sidebar) 
(bl) 
 By ANDREW H. FIXMER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Looking for a low-mileage Trans Am driven only to church on
Sundays (by a little old lady, naturally)? Or do you have your own
cream puff to sell, like that '72 Gremlin up on blocks in the
backyard?
</P>
<P>
   You can find such unlikely machines on the Internet, of course,
but increasingly you'll also find hundreds of thousands of more
promising vehicles. And if you shop on the World Wide Web, you can
kick the tires while kicking back in your pajamas _ and without a
cigar-chomping salesman barking, ``So, how much can you afford to
pay?''
</P>
<P>
   Just as entrepreneurs are remaking the new-car landscape by
trying to reduce, or replace, the middlemen between manufacturers
and consumers, others are trying to find a magic formula for
used-car sales over the Internet. Their incentive is substantial:
the used-vehicle market amounts to $370 billion a year, according
to J.D. Power &AMP; Associates, the market research firm.
</P>
<P>
   Power says that 26 percent of used-car shoppers went to the
Internet last year before buying, up from 14 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Sites that offer free used-car classified listings include top
Internet new-car retailers like Autobytel.com, AutoWeb.com and
Cars.com. Here are some other sites that offer forums for buying or
selling used cars: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AUTOTRADER.COM _ This site says it is the largest used-car
marketplace in cyberspace with 1.5 million listings. Its size can
be attributed, in part, to the participation of thousands of
bricks-and-mortar dealers and large auction houses where dealers
buy used vehicles at wholesale.
</P>
<P>
   The site allows a shopper to restrict a search by make, model
and region. For instance, one can look for a '95 Honda Accord
within 25 miles of New Brunswick, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Sellers list their cars without charge; the site makes money by
selling enhancements like bold-face type, hyperlinks to dealerships
or ads alongside the listings.
</P>
<P>
   EBAY.COM _ This site, the Internet's premier on-line auctioneer,
recently struck an agreement with AutoTrader.com and now has
listings for most makes and models of used cars across the country.
</P>
<P>
   The cars being auctioned are coming from both dealerships and
private listings. Although it is free to buy or bid on a car, the
seller pays eBay $25 to list the car online, and another $25 after
the car is sold.
</P>
<P>
   YAHOO.COM _ As it continues to expand into new fields of
e-commerce, Yahoo now offers automobiles through its online
auction.
</P>
<P>
   Interested bidders can search for a car by make or model, but it
is difficult to restrict a search by region. A recent hunt for a
1996 Ford Mustang convertible found no available cars in the New
York City area. As with eBay, a user can search for every Mustang
convertible being auctioned and decide if the car is worth the cost
of having it shipped. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   IMOTORS.COM _ This site, which calls itself the Web's only
direct used-car seller, says it will track down any car a shopper
wants, recondition it and deliver it to the customer. The site
allows a shopper to order a car up to five years old, even
specifying mileage, trim and options. But the lower the mileage,
the higher the price, and hard-to-find trim may add to the
customer's wait _ iMotors says the average wait is about three
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Imotors.com searches for the car through auctions and private
listings _ but not through dealers _ then reconditions it to retail
condition. The customer drives off with a seven-day, 700-mile
money-back guarantee and a three-month, 3,000-mile warranty.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a true retailer, trying to build a new supply channel
for consumers,'' said Eli Halliwell, co-founder and chief strategy
officer. The company, which started in San Francisco, recently
expanded to the East. It now has reconditioning centers near
Cincinnati, Atlanta and Sacramento, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   BESTOFFER.COM _ This site, which currently operates only in
Northern California, holds the hands of buyers and sellers as they
move through a transaction in an auction-style marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   Sellers can list their cars without charge; both buyer and
seller pay fees after they reach a deal. To reassure potential
buyers, BestOffer sends mechanics out to make an 80-point
inspection of the vehicle and prepare a report on it. The Web site
makes arrangements with independent dealerships where sellers can
leave their cars and interested bidders can come to examine them or
take test drives. This frees sellers from having strangers come to
their homes. &QL;

   PRICE AUTO OUTLET _ Vehicles returned to Bank of America at the
end of their leases go to giant lots in Linden, N.J.; Bethpage,
N.Y.; and Anaheim, Calif. The ever-changing inventory of these
late-model vehicles is posted at PriceAutoOutlet.com and is updated
daily.
</P>
<P>
   Prices tend to be below Kelley Blue Book values. If you find a
car on the Price site that interests you, but you live more than 50
miles away, the company will give you $50 to come over and take a
look.
</P>
<P>
   Mechanics check each vehicle. Cars come with a 72-hour
money-back guarantee and a six-month, 6,000-mile warranty.

   &UR; ANOTHER SITE FOR PRICE INFORMATION &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By ANDREW H. FIXMER &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Playing catch-up after being left behind in the rush to the
Internet, the National Automobile Dealers Association has put its
used-car prices online.
</P>
<P>
   For 67 years, NADA, the nation's leading organization of car
dealers, has provided information on market values of cars, trucks
and motorcycles to insurance companies, lenders and government
agencies. Over the years, it added prices for other conveyances,
including motor homes, yachts and airplanes. Many consumers have
used NADA's pocket-sized yellow books to determine the current
value of a used car they are buying or selling; prices are based on
annual surveys of dealers, auctions and classified ads. Like the
book, the Web site (www.nadaguides.com) gives prices in three
categories _ low, average and high _ based on the car's condition.
</P>
<P>
   By taking so long to move online, NADA let its chief competitor
on price data, Kelley Blue Book, become entrenched. Since its
Internet debut in 1995, Kelley has expanded its site (www.kbb.com)
to offer new-car prices, buying tips and other data. It routinely
ranks among the most-used auto sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't want to put something out unless it was complete and
accurate,'' said Lenny Simms, general manager of NADA appraisal
guides. ``Should we have gone on the Internet five years ago? Sure,
but I think the wait was worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years there has been explosive growth in the number of
Web sites vying to play a role in the car-buying process, often by
providing leads on interested customers to dealerships in exchange
for commissions, flat fees or a percentage of sales.
</P>
<P>
   Many sites provide research tools and new-car price data. Kelley
has long offered such information, as has Edmunds.com, a
clearinghouse for consumer information that last week announced
ties with several leading Internet auto retailers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We definitely have a lot of catching up to do,'' Simms said.
</P>
<P>
   NADA's site has been operating for only about a month, and it
still has some bugs. For instance, during a search for the market
price of a '94 Jaguar XJS convertible, the site asked if the car
had a sunroof.
</P>
<P>
   The NADA and Kelley Blue Book sites, which are both free,
provide similar prices. In a random sampling, Kelley's retail
prices for four common cars were within $200 of NADA's average
prices.
</P>
<P>
   While Kelley's online data bank includes only cars made within
the last 20 years, NADA provides values for 50 years, making it
more useful for old-car enthusiasts. Kelley also provides new-car
prices, which NADA intends to add this month.
</P>
<P>
   Each company asserts that its pricing guide is the industry
standard, and both expect more competition. ``When you're No. 1,
everyone wants a piece of the action,'' said Stephen Henson,
director of marketing and business development for Kelley Blue
Book. &QL;

same-sex couples than any other state, although the bill stops

   NO-INSURANCE-DOCS (Undated) _ A growing number of doctors have
severed their ties to HMOs and insurance companies. In return for
cash payments, the doctors often offer a lavish level of service _
uncrowded waiting rooms, uninterrupted office visits and an office
staff that knows the patients. Nearly a decade after President
Clinton's failed effort to remake health care in America, the
health care market is remaking itself. For those with insurance or
the money to pay for health care, there is evolving a two-tiered
system. One tier is made up of doctors who have cut their prices at
the insistence of health insurers and who make up for the reduced
prices by increasing their volume. The other tier is made up of
those who offer time and attention _ but at a cost. By Lawrence K.

North Korea has gone from one of the world's most politically
reclusive states, to one of the most diplomatically active. With
little fanfare, but with a speed that has surprised many observers
of the Communist country, the government in Pyongyang has
established diplomatic relations with Italy and has resumed
diplomatic discussions with Japan and Australia for the first time
in years. It has also recently sent out discreet feelers to at
least two other major Western nations, Canada and Britain. And
according to diplomats in the Philippines, it has approached their

<TEXT>
<P>
   Here is a selective listing by critics of The New York Times of
new or noteworthy movies currently playing in theaters. Running
times and ratings of films are in parentheses.
</P>
<P>
   `ALL ABOUT MY MOTHER,' starring Cecilia Roth, Marisa Paredes,
Antonia San Juan and Penelope Cruz. Directed by Pedro Almodovar (R,
101 minutes; in Spanish with English subtitles). A whole new order
of Almodovar extravaganza. The antic fizz and theatrical
exaggeration of his earlier work have blossomed into a newly
sophisticated style, one that is far more wise and deeply felt.
Lovingly dedicated to actresses who have played actresses, this
film weaves its own soap opera around ``A Streetcar Named Desire''
and tells of splendidly resilient women; Almodovar has aptly
described his material as ``screwball drama.'' Rich and
entertaining, this story celebrates the power of artifice and
impersonation to transcend ordinary truth. The irrepressible San
Juan, a Spanish nightclub performer, plays a transsexual named
Agrado and is the film's biggest treat (Janet Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `AMERICAN BEAUTY,' starring Kevin Spacey, Annette Bening, Chris
Cooper, Wes Bentley and Thora Birch. Written by Alan Ball. Directed
by Sam Mendes (R, 116 minutes). With heavenly finesse Spacey plays
a buttoned-down 42-year-old suburbanite who flips his lid for a
teen-age cheerleader. And he never gets it back on. The midlife
crisis motif is familiar, but the stage director Sam Mendes brings
terrific visual flair and dry humor to this barbecuing of the
bourgeoisie. All the actors display coolly expert timing,
especially Bening as the antihero's grasping wife. Although the
story spreads itself thin among many characters, the film coalesces
for a devastating finale (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `BOILER ROOM,' starring Giovanni Ribisi, Vin Diesel and Ben
Affleck. Written and directed by Ben Younger (R, 110 minutes).
Ribisi portrays a young stockbroker in training at a fly-by-night
company called J.T. Marlin. Like Oliver Stone's ``Wall Street,''
``Boiler Room'' tells the story of an ambitious young man's rise,
fall and redemption. And like Charlie Sheen's Bud Fox, Ribisi's
Seth carries some heavy Oedipal baggage _ a troubled relationship
with his demanding, disapproving father _ onto the trading floor.
But at its best, which is awfully good, ``Boiler Room'' avoids the
thumping moralism that has made Stone the least misunderstood
director in Hollywood. It's less about selling your soul than about
feeling your oats (A.O. Scott).
</P>
<P>
   `THE CIDER HOUSE RULES,' starring Tobey Maguire, Charlize Theron
and Delroy Lindo. Directed by Lasse Hallstrom (PG-13, 125 minutes).
Radically downsized in scope, and its examination of the issue of
abortion greatly softened, John Irving's sixth novel (with a
Dickensian screenplay by the author) has been turned into a lovely
World War II-era fable about a young man venturing out into the
world. Maguire is Homer Wells, a doleful innocent raised in an
orphanage by Dr. Wilbur Larch (Michael Caine), who performs
abortions. Fleeing the institution with a golden young couple
(Theron and Paul Rudd), he becomes an apple picker. Sentimental but
smart, the movie has the sweetness and narrative drive of a 1940s
``David Copperfield'' (Stephen Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `GHOST DOG: THE WAY OF THE SAMURAI,' starring Forest Whitaker.
Directed by Jim Jarmusch (R, 116 minutes). In his new film Jarmusch
does for the samurai epic and the gangster movie what he did for
the western in ``Dead Man,'' his dreamy, elegiac deconstruction of
cowboys-and-Indians mythology. Here he has composed a ruminative,
bittersweet visual essay on brutality, honor and tribalism, which
may frustrate audiences expecting more visceral thrills. ``Ghost
Dog'' is worth seeing for Whitaker's witty, moving performance as a
modern-day samurai caught up in a Mafia vendetta, for Jarmusch's
offbeat sense of cinematic style, and for hip-hop artist the RZA's
brilliant musical effects (Scott).
</P>
<P>
   `THE HURRICANE,' starring Denzel Washington. Directed by Norman
Jewison (R, 120 minutes). The life story of Hurricane Carter, a
middleweight contender who spent nearly 20 years in prison for a
triple murder he didn't commit, is a big, schmaltzy ballad of a
movie redeemed by Washington's moving, bone-deep portrayal of the
boxer from Paterson, N.J. But the movie plays fast and loose with
the facts, giving far too much credit to the members of a Canadian
commune who took up Carter's cause and all but eliminating his
heroic co-defendant, John Artis, from the story. And the minor
characters are either saints or monsters. Yet the story of a man
heroically fighting his demons and winning his freedom is still
inspiring (Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `MISSION TO MARS,' starring Gary Sinise, Tim Robbins, Don
Cheadle and Connie Nielsen. Directed by Brian De Palma (PG, 113
minutes). This film's visual design is spectacular, and the scenes
on the Martian surface look so real that the picture could have
been made on location. But the movie is undermined by De Palma's
uncharacteristic wet-eyed awe. All this addled sincerity comes from
trying to create wonderment for adults, growing out of a morose
astronaut's rediscovery of his humanity on Mars. Sinise plays the
depressed astronaut, and his thoughtful patience makes him appear
to be a little sluggish, though not as sluggish as the movie:
narratively it seems to be taking place in zero gravity, where each
minute seems to last an additional 30 seconds. In space no one can
hear you snore (Elvis Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   `THE NEXT BEST THING,' starring Rupert Everett and Madonna.
Directed by John Schlesinger (PG-13, 107 minutes). A contemporary
screwball comedy about a Los Angeles yoga teacher (Madonna) and her
gay best friend (Everett) who have a baby together, ``The Next Best
Thing'' intermittently fizzes in its early scenes. But once it gets
serious, the movie turns into a stumbling, poor man's ``Kramer vs.
Kramer.'' Madonna is a curt, cool cookie whose painfully flat
performance is all but devoid of feeling. Everett has a few bright
comic moments as a man who discovers the joys of fatherhood
(Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   `THE NINTH GATE,' starring Johnny Depp and Frank Langella.
Directed by Roman Polanski (R, 133 minutes). For those with an
interest in seeing a dinner-theater version of ``Eyes Wide Shut,''
then look no further. This film, with its wizened decadence and its
tired stabs at comedy, is calling your name. Langella is Boris
Balkan, a wealthy and therefore evil collector of Devil-inspired
antiquities, who hires Dean Corso (Depp), a weedy rogue book
dealer, to locate a volume called ``The Nine Gates.'' Will Balkan
get Satan's powers in his clutches through mastery of the book?
Polanski is out to cross ``Rosemary's Baby'' with his saucy spoof
``The Fearless Vampire Killers,'' but this movie is about as scary
as a sock-puppet re-enactment of ``The Blair Witch Project,'' and
not nearly as funny (Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   `NOT ONE LESS,' starring Wei Minzhi and Zhang Huike. Directed by
Zhang Yimou (not rated, 106 minutes). Zhang Yimou's new drama
enlarges the possibilities of filmmaking even as it grounds itself
in one of cinema's oldest, most basic principles: the camera's
ability to document reality. At the center of the film is Wei (Wei
Minzhi), a 13-year-old primary school graduate who has been pressed
into service as a substitute teacher in the Shuiquan Primary
School. When one of her students is sent to the city to work off
his parents' debts, Wei, who has been promised a bonus if she can
keep her class intact (this is the source of the film's title),
sets out to bring him home. And the movie, which has so far been a
slow, touching study of village life, becomes something else: a
work of lyrical realism that has some of the shattering, redemptive
power of Vittorio De Sica's ``Bicycle Thief'' (Scott).
</P>
<P>
   `REINDEER GAMES,' starring Ben Affleck, Gary Sinise and Charlize
Theron. Directed by John Frankenheimer (R, 99 minutes). This is a
wheel-within-a-wheel thriller that's a lot of fun until, near the
end, it becomes a Xerox copy of a blueprint of a hit. Affleck, who
suggests one of the Kennedys playing Clark Kent _ he wants to keep
his light under a bushel, but he's not quite up to it _ plays Rudy,
an ex-con who gets dragged into a casino heist planned for the
Christmas season. Theron is the girl who lures him into the job.
The seamy kicks of one double cross after another keep the movie in
motion, and Frankenheimer's ruthless precision keeps it on track
(Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   `TOPSY-TURVY,' starring Allan Corduner and Jim Broadbent.
Directed by Mike Leigh (R, 161 minutes). Leigh's grandly
entertaining ``Topsy-Turvy'' is one of those films that create a
mix of erudition, pageantry and delectable acting opportunities,
much as ``Shakespeare in Love'' did. Instead of a love-struck young
playwright, it presents the curiously matched personalities of the
librettist William Schwenk Gilbert and the composer Arthur Sullivan
in the midst of a robust, knowing, frequently hilarious look at the
musical theater over which they held sway (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `WHAT PLANET ARE YOU FROM?,' starring Garry Shandling, Greg
Kinnear and Annette Bening. Directed by Mike Nichols (R, 115
minutes). There's a lot of Shandling in this movie, which isn't
surprising since he is one of its writers. He plays Harold, an
alien whose mission is to find a woman to bear him a child he can
take back to his home planet. Eventually the flakiness of
earthlings infects Harold as he spends more time among them; he
can't trust himself anymore. It's ``The Man Who Fell to Earth''
played for laughs. Unfortunately, ``Planet'' is just as cold
conceptually. Nichols drapes his dry imperiousness over the script,
which results in a romantic comedy without a romance. This movie
wants to be sweet and dark at the same time, but it is as distant
as a planet's satellite (Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   `THE WHOLE NINE YARDS,' starring Matthew Perry and Bruce Willis.
Directed by Jonathan Lynn (R, 100 minutes). Oz (Perry) is a
nice-guy dentist beaten down by his bored wife. When the confident
Jimmy (Willis) breezes into the house next door, Oz's anxieties are
ratcheted up several points on the Richter scale. It turns out that
Jimmy is a former Chicago organized-crime figure who ratted out his
associates. The movie has an intricate plot, with hit men, love
interests, large sums of money and allegiances constantly in
motion. But it is missing the verve of someone who can take a
simple idea to the extreme; it must have been directed by a
sleepwalker. Despite Perry's plucky slapstick and the treacherous
gunplay that accounts for the second half of the movie, ``Yards''
is underwhelming, amusing only in fits and starts (Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   `WONDER BOYS,' starring Michael Douglas, Frances McDormand and
Tobey Maguire. Directed by Curtis Hanson (R, 112 minutes). This
film boasts a first-rate cast, a credible literary source and a
director whose last film, ``L.A. Confidential,'' showed a
prodigious ability to capture the headlong rhythms of a complex
plot and the particularities of a motley assortment of characters.
But even with so much going for it, this adaptation of Michael
Chabon's novel about a pot-smoking middle-aged novelist burdened by
romantic and creative problems is flat and unconvincing. There's no
shortage of screwball material: a dead dog, an errant tuba and a
very tall drag queen, for starters. But Hanson, perhaps aiming for
wry understatement, has smothered whatever antic rhythm the story
might have had. Despite a brilliant supporting turn by Robert
Downey Jr. as a gay book editor, ``Wonder Boys'' is like a George
Cukor movie with a bad head cold: slow, muffled and vague (Scott).

COMMENTARY: GET REAL ON KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Karl Kraus, the famous Austrian journalist and playwright, once
observed that European wars were caused by diplomats who lied to
journalists and then believed what they read in the newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   One is reminded of that aphorism today when listening to U.S.
and NATO officials insist that they are still committed to building
a multi-ethnic Kosovo _ despite the murderous inter-ethnic violence
still going on there and the obvious desire of the Pentagon and
NATO to get out of Kosovo forever.
</P>
<P>
   It's time U.S. and NATO officials stopped fibbing to themselves
and then believing their own quotes. It's obvious that the Kosovar
Serbs and Albanians hate each other and have no intention of living
together in the idealistic multi-ethnic state that the Clintonites
once envisaged.
</P>
<P>
   Now it might be momentarily satisfying to just walk away,
telling both sides: ``You people deserve each other. Why don't you
just slug it out and call us when you're exhausted.'' But that
would only lead to another bloodbath and refugee turmoil. Like it
or not, the U.S. and NATO do have an interest in stability in the
Balkans _ if for no other reason than that it would allow them to
focus on more important problems.
</P>
<P>
   Since we can't walk away, our real choices are clear: Either we
disarm the warriors of Kosovo or we disarm the warring politics of
Kosovo. That is to say, when dealing with an unfinished civil war,
in which people hate each other but are still living side by side,
one option is to use overwhelming force to disarm the whole
population and then stand guard on every street corner until they
learn to love each other. At a time when NATO wants to reduce its
troops in Kosovo, this option is not realistic.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves the other option _ disarming the politics of Kosovo.
Right now the politics of Kosovo is always on the verge of
explosion, because neither of the big parties _ the Serbs nor the
Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army _ are content or exhausted. The KLA
is using the U.S. zone in Kosovo as a privileged sanctuary to
infiltrate southern Serbia and aid ethnic Albanians living there,
while the Serbs are infiltrating men and materiel into northern
Kosovo to protect their people there.
</P>
<P>
   The only way NATO can reduce its presence in Kosovo, without it
blowing up, is by doing what NATO did in Bosnia: disarm the
politics by tacitly partitioning the country. Bosnia is stable
today because the key factions were exhausted by four years of war
and got what they wanted: their own ethnic zones. Once the dividing
lines were stable, all NATO had to do was patrol them. And once the
parties in Bosnia were secure in their own space, they were more
willing to reach out to one another.
</P>
<P>
   To disarm the politics of Kosovo, NATO needs to convene the
parties and redraw (or impose) a new map. One idea would be to move
the Serbian border with Kosovo near Mitrovica to the south _ to
encompass the biggest pocket of Serbs still living inside Kosovo.
In return, the Serbs would be asked to give the Kosovo Albanians
the two small counties of Serbia along Kosovo's eastern border,
where a large number of Albanians still live. That would create
much cleaner dividing lines. Then NATO could make Kosovo a
self-ruling republic of Yugoslavia, with a promise to consider
independence sometime in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, NATO could tell the Serbs that if they agreed to this
land swap the sanctions on them would be lifted. The Serbs would
get out from their deep economic hole. The Albanians would have
self-rule. And NATO could patrol the fence between them.
</P>
<P>
   True, this would mean the world would effectively have two
Albanias _ the original Albania and a new Kosovo Albania. Although
the Albanians have not shown any capacity for running one state
properly, let alone two, Europe will have to live with it.
</P>
<P>
   A broken Kosovo is no place to be experimenting with
multiculturalism or affirmative action. As Stalin would say,
talking of a self-sustaining, multicultural Kosovo today is like
talking about ``hot ice or dry water.'' Our interest is that
Kosovo, like Bosnia, be a place where the different ethnic
communities can live apart, stably, until they choose to live
together again, and where the U.S. and NATO can ensure that
stability at the lowest cost. Since the Kosovo War ended before a
stable dividing line could be established there, we need to draw
that now. Without a stable dividing line we will always be
peacekeepers in a land with no peace to keep.

commentaries are advised to drop in on the exchange between Steven
Soderbergh and Lem Dobbs regarding ``The Limey,'' to be released on
Tuesday on disc and videocassette by Artisan.

<P>
   Soderbergh directed the film, and Dobbs wrote it. He also wrote
Soderbergh's ``Kafka'' (1991). The director describes a ``playfully
contentious relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   On the disc the playing is a little rough. Here's an opportunity
many screenwriters would kill for: going public with a director who
didn't exactly do it the way you intended.
</P>
<P>
   DOBBS: That scene was the glue.
</P>
<P>
   SODERBERGH: It ground the film to a halt.
</P>
<P>
   DOBBS: Your direction, then.
</P>
<P>
   SODERBERGH: No, I don't think so. It just didn't fit.
</P>
<P>
   Both of them stay in stride. Later, during a telephone
interview, Soderbergh said, ``Because of the way Lem and I relate
to each other, I knew if we got into a room and did a commentary it
wouldn't be the standard back-slapping situation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Limey'' is one of those good little films that attract a
growing audience, though not a large one, and gain a reputation far
beyond their box-office receipts, which in this case amounted to
about $3 million. Years earlier Dobbs had the most stripped-down of
concepts.
</P>
<P>
   ``A guy comes to L.A. to avenge a murder,'' Soderbergh said.
Later the two of them developed a film about an English ex-convict
named Wilson (Terence Stamp) who goes to California to investigate
the death of his daughter, Jenny. When she died, supposedly in a
car accident, Jenny was the mistress of a record mogul named
Valentine (Peter Fonda) who had his start and early successes in
the '60s.
</P>
<P>
   From there, director and writer diverged. Soderbergh sought to
keep the focus solely on Wilson, a tough, haunted character of
about 60 who is obsessed with the loss of his child. As portrayed
by Stamp, wiry and 60-ish himself, Wilson wipes out a roomful of
thugs one moment and settles into wistful memories of Jenny the
next. For the director, that was character enough for this film.
</P>
<P>
   Dobbs, though, had written several side stories about Valentine
and other characters. Soderbergh said they distracted from the
concentration on Wilson and cut them. On the disc Dobbs chides him
about not being interested in inner lives and relationships, and he
worries that people will think the film sketchy and underwritten.
</P>
<P>
   The director holds his ground. ``I err on the side of less, but
that just reflects my taste about what I want to see in a movie,''
he says.
</P>
<P>
   Points made, the two move on. Not to contradict himself, Dobbs
praises Soderbergh for making a movie about an individual and not
resorting to the ensemble approach common today.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Soderbergh, whose ``Erin Brockovich'' opens
Friday, reiterated his sympathy for Dobbs. ``He is correct in
saying that he was criticized for writing a shallow piece, because
I did cut out a lot of that other stuff,'' he said. ``I do get his
point, but there's not a lot I can do about it.'' &QL;

   Jakob the Liar &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In another ``upbeat'' Holocaust movie, a Polish restaurateur
(Robin Williams) decides he'll cheer up his fellow concentration
camp inmates by pretending he has a radio and is hearing news of
imminent liberation. That gives Williams a chance to do his Winston
Churchill imitation, but it also opens the floodgates for a rush of
strained good spirits that rob the tale of credibility.
</P>
<P>
   In this Holocaust story, an Anne Frank look-alike (Hannah Taylor
Gordon) may just live happily ever after. And, Janet Maslin wrote
in The New York Times, ``the film anticipates all laughter and
emotion in ways that make it its own worst enemy.'' &QL;

ST. PATRICK'S DAY MOOD CLOUDED BY EVENTS IN ULSTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN AND KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It was meant to be what the Irish call a
``hooley,'' a grand party, a St. Patrick's Day that President
Clinton and Irish leaders could celebrate not only as Ireland's
national day, but as the first one in decades when Northern Ireland
was at peace and under local rule.
</P>
<P>
   The St. Patrick's Day events of this week, however, have instead
taken on the quality of another peculiarly Hibernian gathering: an
Irish wake. The peace process, while hardly dead, is in dire need
of resuscitation, and leaders on both sides of the Atlantic did not
seem optimistic that a cure would be found soon.
</P>
<P>
   Continuing a 20-year tradition, Clinton, members of Congress,
and Irish leaders sat Thursday for a traditional St. Patrick's Day
lunch _ this one, a day early to accommodate the legislative
schedule. There was prime rib, potatoes, green beans, and even dark
Guinness beer, unusual for a midday event on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   The key players were there: Ulster Unionist leader David
Trimble, Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern, and Sinn Fein president
Gerry Adams. Cardinal Law delivered the invocation, and Clinton
made a speech.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of what Clinton hoped to have _ a St. Patrick's
address congratulating all parties for their success in forging a
long-fought and hard-won peace _ all the president could do was
deliver what witnesses described as a wistful thanks for the
progress that had been made, and a plea that the warring parties
not allow things to regress.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton ``spoke from the heart,'' thanking the members of
Congress for their bipartisanship on Ireland amid an otherwise
bitterly partisan seven-plus years, said Representative Martin
Meehan, Democrat of Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   The president was ``a little melancholy,'' however, expressing
his great frustration and even anger, Meehan recounted.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble sat on one side of the room; his foe, Adams, was perched
on the other. When the luncheon ended about 80 minutes later, the
men departed the Capitol through separate doors.
</P>
<P>
   Ahern and Adams set off for separate meetings with key members
of Congress. Clinton, who Thursday night received the Millennium
Peace Award from the American Ireland Fund for his work on Northern
Ireland, is expected to meet with leaders in the peace process
Friday _ also separately.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm growing impatient,'' Peter Mandelson, the British state
secretary for Northern Ireland, told reporters in Washington
Thursday. ``The coming weeks will demand more courage and more
compromise. Everyone will have to take risks. Everyone will be
asked to stretch. Nobody will get exactly what they want.''
</P>
<P>
   At this stage, those close to the process say, the best hope is
that both sides will hold tightly to the progress that has been
made and not slip back to the bloody ``Troubles'' between Catholics
and Protestants that have ravaged Northern Ireland for the last 30
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not expect any major breakthroughs'' during the Irish
leaders' visit to Washington, said Michael Hammer, a spokesman for
the National Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   The British government last month suspended the fledgling
power-sharing government in Northern Ireland just 72 days after it
had handed power back to local politicians for the first time since
1974. Mandelson, who is leading the British delegation to
Washington, said he suspended the assembly to avert a threatened
walkout by the Ulster Unionists, who represent most Protestants.
</P>
<P>
   Adams, however, whose party is close to the IRA, said a unionist
disarmament deadline was unilateral and fell outside the terms of
the 1998 Good Friday Agreement. The accord, a compromise that
created political institutions intended to transform Northern
Ireland into a peaceful, democratic society, provides that all
paramilitary groups should be disarmed by May 2000. Adams accused
the British government of caving in to a unionist veto.
</P>
<P>
   In a Catch-22 for which no one has found an exit, the IRA says
it will not discuss disarming until the power-sharing government is
restored, while unionists say they will not sit in government with
Sinn Fein until the IRA begins disarming.
</P>
<P>
   ``If David Trimble advances the mantra, `no guns, no
government,' you can be sure the IRA response will be `no
government, no guns,' '' said Representative Richard Neal, Democrat
of Springfield, who confers frequently with Clinton on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Exploiting the political vacuum, dissident Irish republican and
British loyalist paramilitary groups have stepped up their
activities in the past month. The republicans are trying to set off
bombs, hoping it would lead to a collapse of the peace process,
while loyalists are busy trying to settle some lethal internecine
scores and continue to kill ordinary Catholics occasionally in what
seems an attempt to goad the Irish Republican Army into breaking
its cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   Britain did make a conciliatory gesture Thursday, as Mandelson
announced that more troops were being pulled out of Northern
Ireland. The pullout means that for the first time since 1969,
there will be no British batallion resident in Belfast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, elsewhere the security profile is higher,''
Mandelson said. ``But that is because elsewhere the level of threat
is higher.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams downplayed the move as ``cynical,'' though welcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always glad to see British troops going home,'' he said in
an interview. ``But I have to say that I'm quite cynical about the
timing of the announcement. A little media announcement on St.
Patrick's Day in Washington isn't what's required here.''
</P>
<P>
   Mandelson, meanwhile, criticized the IRA for failing to give up
its weapons, calling it ``a stumbling block'' to peace.
</P>
<P>
   Turning in weapons ``remains an essential part of the peace
process,'' he said. ``I know that people have fears, fears that
they will be asked to move first, or make bigger sacrifices than
the other side.''
</P>
<P>
   But those who ``retreat into those fears . . . will pay a heavy
price for their insularity,'' Mandelson said.

TAIWAN VOTERS LEANING TOWARD CHANGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By INDIRA A.R. LAKSHMANAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAIPEI _ Unfazed by China's dark threats of the consequences,
backers of Taiwan's independence-minded opposition can almost taste
victory in Saturday's vote for president, victory that would end 56
years of unbreakable rule by one all-powerful party.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands skipped out of work Thursday morning to line the
streets of the capital on a grey and drizzly day, madly waving
green party flags and rhythmically chanting their man's nickname
until they went hoarse: ``A-bian! Get elected! A-bian! Get
elected!''
</P>
<P>
   His supporters set off hundreds of ear-splitting firecrackers as
an energetic Chen Shui-bian passed in a red, open-top Jeep
Wrangler, leading a miles-long motorcade through streets that he is
credited with cleansing of vice, traffic, gangsters, and potholes
when he was mayor of this capital city.
</P>
<P>
   ``Taiwan people know the future is not backward!'' technician
May Fu, 54, shouted over the din from fellow Chen supporters.
``China is always trying to harass us, act with us like a father
with a son. That just makes us feel more strongly Taiwanese.''
</P>
<P>
   In stark contrast, the headquarters of the ruling party
candidate, Vice President Lien Chan, was cloaked Thursday afternoon
in an almost palpable sense of resignation that their
once-omnipotent party might actually lose the presidency for the
first time. One glum party worker napped under a campaign banner
while several volunteers decked out in party colors gossiped idly
at a table, waiting for instructions.
</P>
<P>
   Across town, their candidate Lien _ a stiff and charmless
politician who makes Al Gore at his most wooden seem like Michael
Jackson _ delivered a speech in an unbroken monotone, never
glancing up from his text. The top brass of his ruling nationalist
party sat unsmiling and listless at a long table, looking more like
corpses in suits than enthusiastic party operatives determined to
stump their man into office.
</P>
<P>
   Even a week ago, the defeat of the Kuomintang nationalists _ the
world's richest political party and the second-longest-ruling after
Mexico's PRI _ was unimaginable for many. The last opinion polls
nine days ago showed the top three candidates _ Vice President
Lien, former mayor Chen, and James Soong, a populist former
governor _ in a dead heat, with a quarter of the electorate
undecided. But a final-week surge for Chen has many convinced the
vote could break the nationalists' five-decade stranglehold on
power.
</P>
<P>
   Still, with $6 billion at their disposal, a well-oiled political
machine, and the specter of stability versus war, the nationalists
could yet pull a victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other candidates may shout, but that doesn't mean they
have something to say,'' said Daniel Dong, a 45-year-old party
volunteer. ``Charisma doesn't count if you're going to lead the
country to war or insecurity.''
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, support from the disenchanted electorate for Soong, a
popular maverick, cannot be underestimated. Further complicating
predictions, election analysts said some voters were likely to
change their pick in the last minute, opting for their second
choice if they feel their favorite cannot win.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the outcome, the election is historic for the 22
million residents of this prosperous island that has lived 51 years
in the shadow of mainland China. These are Taiwan's first truly
contested elections for president; four years ago, incumbent
President Lee Teng-hui, who held appointed posts under Taiwan's
four-decade martial law, won an unsurprising victory in the
island's first direct vote. This time, in contrast, the field has
been wide open and the race too close to call.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever wins will set the course of relations with longtime
rival communist China, a relationship now at a nadir as Beijing
daily issues angry threats of war if Taiwan's winner declares
independence _ or even delays reunification.
</P>
<P>
   The victor will also have to answer popular demands to reform
Taiwan's notorious money-driven politics, and cut links between
gangsters and elected officials. The new president will likewise
chart the future of party politics and constitutional reform in
Taiwan's 13-year-old democracy. Likely to scrape by with less than
half the vote, however, the winner will lack the mandate and
unquestioned authority of outgoing patriarch Lee.
</P>
<P>
   The single campaign issue that has grabbed the most attention
worldwide is the China question, and how each candidate proposes to
deal with the communist rivals across the 100-mile Taiwan strait.
China considers Taiwan a breakaway province that must be reunited
with the mainland after the nationalists' retreat to the island in
1949, following their loss in China's civil war.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, however, Taiwan has functioned in practice as a
sovereign state with a robust capitalist economy and trade
relations with most of the world, but without direct economic,
political, or transport links with the mainland. Years of polls
have shown that most Taiwanese favor maintaining the status quo,
quietly operating independently without declaring it, to avoid
provoking their 800-pound gorilla of a neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, the three candidates' official positions on
China are hard to distinguish. All have peace plans and offers to
expand economic ties and communication links with the mainland,
while retaining de facto independence.
</P>
<P>
   Almost no one in Taiwan wants to reunify before China becomes
democratic, and Chen, who in the past advocated independence, has
vowed daily not to declare it. He even compared himself to
President Nixon, saying he is best suited to establish relations
with China. At least once on the trail, however, he slipped,
shouting, ``Long live Taiwan independence!''
</P>
<P>
   Surveys in recent years show that people increasingly
identifying themselves as ``Taiwanese'' rather than ``Chinese,''
revealing a growing sense of native consciousness and a widening
chasm with their mainland counterparts. Chen's Democratic
Progressive Party has proven that all politics is local, gaining
support by highlighting corruption, the economy, and quality of
life over cross-straits relations.
</P>
<P>
   With a no-nonsense, ``Mr. Clean'' image, Chen made money
politics his main issue, holding himself up as the only credible
reformer. One campaign ad portrayed the nationalist party as bank
robbers bilking the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The nationalists have honed in on the issues of security and
stability. Their ads show gas masks, helmets, and missiles whizzing
overhead if Chen is elected.
</P>
<P>
   Maverick independent James Soong has played the populist card,
milking his break from the nationalist party to paint himself as a
reformer. He has denied accusations of massive corruption and cast
himself as the best bridge between Beijing and Taipei, describing
himself as someone who was born on the mainland and has worked
tirelessly for Taiwan. Soong, who learned all the native dialects
to reach out to every constituency, was once considered the
strongest challenger to the ruling party.
</P>
<P>
   Then, last weekend, Chen's campaign got a boost with a string of
powerful endorsements, from Taiwan's only Nobel laureate _ the
hugely-respected head of the national academy, top businessmen, and
the government's national security adviser. On Sunday, his rally in
Kaohsiung city attracted an estimated 400,000 people, more than any
in Taiwan history.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone was so thrilled. Since Chen's campaign surged last
weekend and China's upped it rhetoric, Taiwan's stock market
dropped eight percent. Chen accused the nationalists of feeding the
drop as a desperate scare tactic.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ When people who say they are curious about classical
music but don't attend concerts are asked what keeps them away,
some say they are intimidated by the ritualistic aspects of
concertgoing, like when to applaud, and some say they aren't sure
where to start. But the most persistent complaint among potential
listeners _ and regular concertgoers as well _ is that ticket
prices for the best-known ensembles and soloists are so high as to
discourage experimentation.
</P>
<P>
   Even critics, who generally get their tickets free, were taken
aback when the best seats at the Metropolitan Opera topped $200 a
few seasons ago. The Philharmonic's top price this season (not
counting gala events) is $92, and seeing a visiting orchestra,
chamber group or recitalist at Carnegie Hall can range from $25 to
$150. For much less, one can sit in the upper balconies, where the
sound is often fine but the performers are distant.
</P>
<P>
   But there are venues that offer knowledgeable listeners superb
music at budget prices. One of the most notable is the Peoples'
Symphony Concerts, which for a century have been giving
knowledgeable listeners a break. Founded in 1900 by Franz X. Arens,
an immigrant conductor who found high ticket prices objectionable
even then, Peoples' Symphony started out as an orchestral series
that offered a five-concert subscription for 25 cents to $1.25 and
single seats for as little as a dime.
</P>
<P>
   These days Peoples' Symphony presents mostly recitals and
chamber music in a schedule balanced between established performers
and promising newcomers. This season, the Juilliard, Guarneri and
Colorado String Quartets and the pianists Ignat Solzehnitsyn and
Orli Shaham have already appeared in the series; Saturday evening,
Eighth Blackbird, a superb young new-music ensemble, is to perform.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets now cost dollars rather than pennies, but the prices
remain remarkably low. A subscription to six Saturday evening
concerts at Washington Irving High School costs $19, with single
tickets going for $5.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a higher-priced series at Town Hall on Sunday
afternoons: six-concert subscriptions are $19 to $52, with single
tickets from $6.50 to $10.50. The pianists Garrick Ohlsson and
Andre-Michel Schub, the violinist Cho-Liang Lin, the Orpheus
Chamber Orchestra, the Johannes Quartet and the Moscow Chamber
Orchestra have performed in that series this season; next month
brings a visit by the baritone John Shirley-Quirk and the pianist
Leon Fleisher. And to celebrate the Peoples' Symphony centenary,
there is a starry concert at Carnegie Hall on May 5, with
performances by some of the musicians who have played in the series
regularly, with tickets priced from $5 to $25 _ about a fifth of
what other concertgoers pay for an equivalent evening at Carnegie.
</P>
<P>
   Besides being one of the best bargains in New York City's
concert life, the performances are also an unusually well-kept
secret. To a degree, it has to be that way because of a delicate
series of commercial transactions. Frequently performers playing
Peoples' Symphony concerts for $5 a ticket or less _ and at
correspondingly reduced fees _ also offer similar or identical
programs in larger halls and at full price a few days later. They
don't want to become cut-rate competition for their own concerts
elsewhere. Moreover, the halls that present their full-price
concerts usually demand exclusivity, something that they often
relax for musicians playing on the Peoples' Symphony series. In
return, Peoples' Symphony does not advertise.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very sensitive to the fact that our musicians are also
performing elsewhere,'' said Frank Salomon, who has managed the
concerts since 1973.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is, Peoples' Symphony would not exist if not for the
extreme generosity of the artists. People like Andras Schiff, Radu
Lupu and the major quartets and trios play for us on a regular
basis for a fifth or a tenth of their normal fees. And I think the
halls realize that we are not a conflict, because the majority of
our subscribers are people who are not able to pay regular ticket
prices. Most are in their late 60s or 70s, and a large percentage
of our audience is made up of retired schoolteachers and artists
who are holding day jobs. Now and then I run into people from our
audience at the 92nd Street Y or at Avery Fisher Hall, but it's a
very small minority.''
</P>
<P>
   Performers have sometimes used their Peoples' Symphony concerts
as warm-ups for more prominent appearances. The flutist James
Galway, early in his career as a soloist, played an all-Bach
recital at Washington Irving the night before he played it at
Carnegie Hall. The cellist Yo-Yo Ma and the violinist Gidon Kremer
have also tested programs that they later played uptown.
</P>
<P>
   `We Fill the Seats'
</P>
<P>
   ``I think an advantage we have,'' Salomon said, ``is that we are
generally sold out on subscription, although with returned tickets,
it is always possible to get in at the last minute. We fill the
seats, so whether they're trying out a new program or just playing
a regular concert, we give them a house filled with people who are
there because they love music.''
</P>
<P>
   That audience, it turns out, is the principal reason many of the
performers pay regular visits to the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are real music lovers who are not necessarily well
heeled,'' said Arnold Steinhardt, the first violinist in the
Guarneri Quartet.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're very enthusiastic, very demanding and sometimes
unruly, but in a nice way. We can't get away, for instance, without
playing encores, and that's rarely the case elsewhere in New York.
New Yorkers are sometimes blase: when the concert ends they stand
up and put on their coats, and we think, `Were we that bad?' But
no, it's just that the attitude is, `We heard the concert, we
enjoyed the concert, now let's get out of here.' But it's different
at Peoples' Symphony concerts. They make you play encores, and if
you don't announce what it is, they call out, `What are you going
to play?' It's fun. It's different. They're the genuine article.''
</P>
<P>
   Ohlsson, who has played in the series every few years since the
mid-1970s, also said the audience was the main attraction.
</P>
<P>
   ``They bring a real love of music to the concerts,'' he said,
``and that's why I do it. It's as simple as that. When they really
like things, they respond. They get it. You know, public art is
full of uncontrollables. As an artist, you want to have an
excellent piano, a beautiful hall and an appreciative audience, and
the audience is a very important part of that equation. This
audience does the audience's job exceptionally well, which is not
always the case.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Legends and More
</P>
<P>
   Over the years an extraordinary roster of great musicians have
played at the Peoples' Symphony concerts. Early on, the now
legendary Flonzaley and Kniesel String Quartets were presented;
later the Budapest and Hungarian Quartets were regular visitors.
The pianists who performed in the series represent the history of
modern piano playing: among them are Benno Moiseiwitsch, Moriz
Rosenthal, Josef Lhevinne, Rudolf Serkin, Jorge Bolet, Claudio
Arrau, William Kapell, Mieczyhslaw Horszowski, Alicia de Larrocha
and Christoph Eschenbach. Violinists have been well-represented,
too, with performances by Georges Enesco, Nathan Milstein, Joseph
Szigeti, Michael Rabin, Isaac Stern, Itzhak Perlman and Pinchas
Zukerman.
</P>
<P>
   The organization's mission has changed little in a hundred
years, although the flourishing of freelance orchestras in New York
_ and the rising cost of rehearsing and performing with them _ led
to a shift toward chamber music and recitals in the first 15 years
of the century, and a decisive break with orchestral music when
Arens, its founding conductor, retired in 1917.
</P>
<P>
   Arens was born in Germany in 1856 and moved to the United States
with his family when he was 10. He was apparently a promising young
musician: not long after the family settled in rural Michigan, he
took a job as organist and choirmaster at a local church. But when
he returned to Europe to study music in Munich, Dresden, Berlin,
Vienna and Paris, he realized how ill-prepared he was to meet his
aspiration of becoming a conductor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up where I had no opportunity to hear great music and
was 27 years old before I heard my first symphony,'' he wrote soon
after he founded the Peoples' Symphony Concerts. ``Even then it
would have been impossible for me to have heard symphony concerts
had the rates of admission in Munich been what they are in New
York.''
</P>
<P>
   How It Started
</P>
<P>
   When Arens returned to the United States in 1898, he settled in
New York City and quickly began planning a series to make symphonic
music available at popular prices. He staked his entire savings of
$2,500 on the venture, which in its first season involved hiring a
40-to-50-player orchestra (pay was $9 for three rehearsals and a
concert) for five concerts at Cooper Union, which held 1,200
listeners. The series sold out instantly, and on the basis of its
success, Arens rounded up a board of wealthy, socially prominent
patrons to help run and underwrite the series, among them members
of the Guggenheim, Vanderbilt, Frick and Roosevelt families.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the organization was barely meeting its budget by 1921,
when it received a $50,000 bequest from Annie Louise Cary Raymond,
a contralto who had had an operatic career in the 1880s. Raymond's
gift became the basis of an endowment that has grown to $2.5
million. One of Salomon's projects for the centenary is to expand
that endowment, but financially, the series seems quite healthy,
given its ticket prices. The budget, for 18 concerts, is about
$230,000 this year. About 10 percent of that cost is covered by
audience donations of about $25,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The amount isn't huge,'' Salomon said, ``but it represents the
spirit of the organization. We get contributions from a little over
half of our subscribers. Normally only 3 to 6 percent of an
audience contributes to organizations from which they benefit, so
this is quite extraordinary.''
</P>
<P>
   A Different Atmosphere
</P>
<P>
   In its early years, the series moved back and forth between
Cooper Union and Carnegie Hall several times, sometimes offering
concerts at both to accommodate the growing audience. A chamber
music series was added in 1910, and in 1913 the chamber concerts
took up residence in the 1,500-seat auditorium at Washington Irving
High School. The school opened that year on what had been the site
of the National Conservatory of Music, which Dvorak directed
briefly in the 1890s. Except for a brief period in the 1970s, when
the concerts moved to Hunter College and Town Hall, Washington
Irving has remained the series' principal home. (The current Town
Hall series was added more recently, to address the concerns of
older concertgoers who preferred daytime concerts.)
</P>
<P>
   Possibly because of the high school environs, the Washington
Irving concerts have an atmosphere unlike most others in New York.
Concertgoers typically begin lining up outside the building at 5
p.m. to get their pick of the unreserved seats when the building
opens at 7, an hour before curtain time. And there is a certain
rambunctiousness in the house. Once when a musician who was about
to perform a new work took a few moments to talk about the composer
and his style, the audience listened raptly for a while, but when
the introduction threatened to become a lecture, a handful of
people called out, ``Play the piece already.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Mann, the founding first violinist of the Juilliard
Quartet, sees the audience as a link to a receding era, a time when
European immigrants settled in New York and attended performances
that reminded them of their roots.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the audience has changed less at Peoples' Symphony
than at a lot of other places,'' Mann said. Speaking of the
manager, he added: ``For one thing, I think Frank has adhered to
the kinds of values that have always been the basis of these
concerts. So where a lot of organizations are scrambling to create
audience interest by hiring ensembles with unusual combinations of
instruments or by presenting jokey events like Canadian Brass
concerts, Peoples' Symphony has always had a generational flow in
which people come to hear what they liked in the old days, or what
they remember their parents liked.''
</P>
<P>
   Salomon is also an artists' manager and runs the Marlboro Music
Festival, the Schneider Concerts at the New School (another
inexpensive series, with tickets for $3.75 if bought on
subscription) and the New York String Orchestra master classes and
concerts, presented annually by the New School and Carnegie Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had gone to the concerts first as an audience member,'' he
said. ``At one point Joseph Mann, my predecessor as manager of the
Peoples' Symphony, wanted to present some of the musicians I
managed _ one of the Musicians from Marlboro groups, then Peter
Serkin and Murray Perahia. We became friends, and when his health
began to fail, he asked if I would work with him and eventually
take over the series. I believed in the institution and its
mission, which was not dissimilar from what I was doing with
Alexander Schneider's concerts at the New School. So we worked
together for about a year, until his death in 1973.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Running the series is not without its frustrations. Salomon
would like younger listeners and families with children to use the
concerts as an introduction to classical music. Some do, he said,
but not enough, and since the series does not advertise, he has not
been able to find a way to reach them.
</P>
<P>
   New Music's Appeal
</P>
<P>
   One way might be by presenting new music. Salomon has
established a tradition of offering one concert devoted entirely to
new music on his series every season, and new works turn up as well
on programs otherwise devoted to standard repertory. This season's
all-contemporary concert, Saturday evening, is by Eighth Blackbird,
a young group with a varied repertory and a polished, visually
striking performance style. The new-music programs, though, have
occasionally drawn irate letters.
</P>
<P>
   ``One year,'' Salomon said, ``we presented Peter Serkin, Aki
Takahashi and two members of the Nexus Percussion Ensemble, and
people threatened to cancel their subscriptions. But the next year
subscriptions were up. And once the Meridian Arts Ensemble included
pieces by Frank Zappa and Captain Beefheart, which was a little
over the top, even for me. That time I got a letter saying, `It's
great that you introduce us to new things, but this was too much.'
Perhaps I wasn't properly vigilant. But I'm mindful of the fact
that people should be forewarned, so that they can stay home if
they want to. And I must say, most of the audience is open and
willing to listen.''

<P>
   THE SHOWS TO COME
</P>
<P>
   By ALLAN KOZINN
</P>
<P>
   The Peoples' Symphony Concerts tend to sell out on subscription,
but some tickets are usually returned and made available at the
door just before each concert. Four concerts and the centenary gala
remain this season. The regular concerts are at Washington Irving
High School, Irving Place at 16th Street, and Town Hall, 123 W.
43rd St., both in Manhattan. The gala is at Carnegie Hall.
Subscription and concert information: (212) 586-4680. Here is a
concert list:
</P>
<P>
   EIGHTH BLACKBIRD. This ensemble made its debut in 1998 with a
vibrantly played program that was all the more impressive because
part of it was done from memory, which is unusual for chamber music
and virtually unheard of with the complexities of new music. The
program includes works written for the group by David Schober,
Carlos Sanchez-Gutierrez and Thomas Albert, along with repertory
works by Donald Martino and Arturo Salinas. Saturday evening at 8,
Washington Irving High School. Tickets: $5.
</P>
<P>
   THE KANDINSKY STRING TRIO. The centerpiece of this ensemble's
concert is the Mozart Divertimento in E flat (K. 563), an
extraordinarily rich late chamber work that is only recently being
played with the frequency it deserves. Also on the program are
Beethoven's Trio in C minor (Op. 9, No. 3) and a recent work by
Guenther Wiesemann, ``Mascara del Suenos.'' March 25 at 8 p.m.,
Washington Irving High School. Tickets: $5.
</P>
<P>
   THE SKAMPA STRING QUARTET WITH CHRISTOPHEREN NOMURA. Nomura, a
highly regarded baritone, joins this Czech quartet for the New York
premiere of Sylvie Bodorova's ``Terezin Ghetto Requiem.'' The
quartet is also to play Mozart's Quartet in A (K. 464) and
Janacek's Quartet No. 2. April 1 at 8 p.m., Washington Irving High
School. Tickets: $5.
</P>
<P>
   JOHN SHIRLEY-QUIRK AND LEON FLEISHER. Fleisher, one of the great
American pianists of the 1950s and early 1960s, was forced by an
injury to his right hand to focus on the repertory for the left
hand. But various forms of therapy have helped him reclaim the use
of his right hand. He is to accompany the great English baritone
John Shirley-Quirk in a recital of Brahms and Schumann songs. April
30 at 2 p.m., Town Hall. Tickets: $6.50 to $10.50.
</P>
<P>
   THE CENTENARY CONCERT. The Ethos Percussion Ensemble, the
Juilliard, Tokyo and Guarneri String Quartets, the
Kalichstein-Laredo-Robinson Trio, Musicians From Marlboro and the
clarinetist Richard Stoltzman, accompanied by his son, Peter
Stoltzman, are helping celebrate the Peoples' Symphony Concerts
100th anniversary with a wide-ranging program that includes works
by Beethoven, Janacek, Webern, Gyorgy Kurtag and Gershwin. May 5 at
7:30 p.m., Carnegie Hall. Tickets: $5 to $25.

 &HT;    Rain or shine: It's still a great day for Irish in Savannah
 &HT;    By Dan Chapman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAVANNAH, Ga. _ The ruddy-faced rector was a picture of serenity
as the skies threatened to douse Thursday's military parade, and
hopes for a festive, record-setting St. Patrick's Day weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Father William O. O'Neill watched the white clouds scudding low
across the sky. His thoughts, though, drifted higher.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the help of God,'' said O'Neill, rector of the Cathedral
of St. John the Baptist, ``we'll survive. We're Irish. We hope for
the best of everything. If it doesn't happen, we'll go on in the
rain.''
</P>
<P>
   Fatalism has long served the Irish well. A healthy dose was also
evident Thursday afternoon among Savannah boosters and others who
expect today's St. Patrick's Day parade _ the nation's second
largest _ to shine, regardless of the weather.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers predict up to 600,000 people will fill the city's
cobblestoned streets to watch the 176th parade honoring the Irish,
their culture and American kin.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the projected three-hour parade, for many, is simply a
prelude to three days of hard revelry along River Street. An
auspicious set of circumstances _ a three-day weekend, the midst of
Spring Break, the new millennium _ could well mean more people than
ever before drink up Savannah's pleasures.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, a record 450,000 people lined Bull, Bay,
Broughton and other streets cheering the bands and beribboned
floats. St. Paddy's Day fell on Wednesday last year; maybe 300,000
chilly spectators turned out.
</P>
<P>
   City leaders make very clear the distinction between the parade
and the Festival on the River, which will roll merrily along
through Sunday. There's not much drinking o' green beer at the
former; there's too much at the latter, they say.
</P>
<P>
   Tired of young drunks and bare breasts, Savannah clamped down on
the beer-fueled bacchanal last year. Cops manned gates to control
the crowds. Wristbands were required of all drinkers to limit
underage shenanigans.
</P>
<P>
   Buoyed by a mellower festival _ and eager to make the weekend
more palatable to families _ city fathers redoubled their
anti-Dionysian efforts this year.
</P>
<P>
   Wristbands now cost $5, a buck more. Seven beer trucks will
dispense the frothy elixir; last year, there were a dozen.
Customers may buy only one beer at a time, and those mugs won't
hold more than 16 ounces, down from 32. And, in perhaps the most
conservative move of all, river festival organizers hired old-fogey
favorites Three Dog Night and The Rascals to perform.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have heard that it's not as wild and crazy as it used
to be,'' said Gordon Varnedoe, director of the Savannah Waterfront
Association. ``So we expect many, many people to come.''

   TV-AUDREY-HEPBURN (Hollywood) _ For an actress who epitomized
American cool, Audrey Hepburn is inspiring a lot of nervous sweat.
In life, her fragile beauty and elegantly pared-down fashion sense
made her one of the most distinctive, most admired stars on the
Hollywood screen. And that is precisely the problem. ``People are
very protective of Audrey Hepburn,'' said Susan Lyne, executive
vice president for movies and mini-series at ABC, which will
broadcast ``The Audrey Hepburn Story'' this month. ``They worry
that someone will come along and try to besmirch her reputation.
It's not like doing the Marilyn Monroe story where people are
salaciously interested in every misstep she took.'' The drama,
starring Jennifer Love Hewitt, will be shown on Monday, March 27.

<P>
   TV-HEWITT-HEPBURN (Undated) _ While Jennifer Love Hewitt, who
will star as Audrey Hepburn on March 27 in ``The Audrey Hepburn
Story,'' has considerable charm and her talent have been
corroborated by an astonishing number of teen-zine cover stories,
the portrayal by a popular young actress of a show business
original like a Hepburn, and Hepburn, can only result in lobsided
comparisons. It seems to me that the outcome of viewing something
like this will be to increase our longing for the genuine article
at the expense of our regard for the woman playing her. By Jeff
MacGregor. (Moved). WITH PHOTO. &QL;

   VIRGIL-THOMSON-MUSIC (New York) _ To a devoted core of admirers,
including this critic, ``The Mother of Us All'' by Virgil Thomson,
which comes to the New York City Opera this Sunday afternoon in a
new production by Christopher Alden first unveiled at the
Glimmerglass Opera in 1998, is the most original and arguably the
greatest of American operas. In a 1984 article in The New Yorker,
Andrew Porter, an infuential critic and opera scholar not known for
a casual use of superlatives, stated that every time he heard ``The
Mother of Us All'' he was ``tempted to consider it the best of all
American operas'' and, on calm reflection, would ``hardly modify
that beyond `one of the three best.''' By Anthony Tommasini.

   REGGIO-FILMS (New York) _ Godfrey Reggio is an alien who wants
to destroy the future from within. At least, that is what he says.
And the funny thing is that the reclusive 59-year-old filmmaker
makes a beguiling sort of sense as he arranges his far-reaching
abstractions about humanity's high-tech dilemmas into pleasant
conversation, much as films like ``Koyaanisqatsi'' and
``Powaqqatsi'' string together pearls of staggering imagery into
artful condemnations of Western civilization. By Ty Burr. (Moved).

   BLACKS-OSCAR (subslug) (Undated) _ It's been nearly 40 years
since the first time an African-American man won the best-actor
Oscar. And in the long, parched stretch of desert since the night
Sidney Poitier got the statuette for his 1963 starring role in
``Lilies of the Field,'' no other black male has received an Oscar
for best actor. Lately, if you were a black man looking for an
Oscar nomination, you had to go to prison. Both of this year's
nominees, Denzel Washington in the best-actor category for ``The
Hurricane'' and Michael Clarke Duncan in the best-supporting group
for ``The Green Mile,'' spend time as convicts in their films. By
Elvis Mitchell. (Moved).  &QL;

</P>
<P>
   CRUDUP-FILMS (Undated) _ So far, most of the articles about
Billy Crudup, 31, _ and there have been a bunch since his 1995
Broadway debut as the heart-piercing tutor in ``Arcadia'' _ have
noted the pronunciation of his name. CREW-dup. CRUDE-up. KROO-dup.
And they have predicted that any time now, any time at all, the
name would become as familiar as DiCaprio or Damon or Affleck: that
the bitter college ladykiller he played in ``Inventing the
Abbotts'' (1997) or the star-crossed runner he played in ``Without
Limits'' (1998) or the pining cowboy he played in ``The Hi-Lo
Country'' (1998) would make him a star. Well, here they come again.
This time, the movie is ``Waking the Dead,'' based on Scott
Spencer's novel about an up-and-coming politician haunted by
intertwined memories of lost love and abandoned ideals. By Sylviane
Gold. (Moved). WITH PHOTO. &QL;

   MAJIDI-FILMS (New York) _ On a sunny Friday afternoon last fall,
the director Majid Majidi, in town for the New York Film Festival
from his native Tehran, was in demand. Negotiations for the
American distribution of his latest film, ``The Color of
Paradise,'' which opens March 31, were under way. Earlier in the
week reporters had been talking with him about Iranian films, about
why they are so often about children and what it is like making
films under censorship. By Friday, Majidi was in Cliffside, N.J.,
at the home of a friend, Jamsheed Akrami, a professor of film and
television at William Paterson University in Wayne, who was
interviewing him for a documentary. The festival circuit is nothing
new to this soft-spoken, sad-eyed 40-year-old director. His last
film, ``Children of Heaven,'' was the first Iranian film ever
nominated for an Academy Award. By Nancy Ramsey. (Moved).  &QL;

   TIBET-FILMS (Undated) _ Considering the Hollywood versions of
Tibet and Buddhist monks, Jamyang Norbu, a Tibetan immigrant and
writer living in Tennessee, considers ``The Cup,'' which opened in
late January, to be a fresh breeze. In it young monks break the
rules, sneaking out at night and snickering over Victoria's Secret
catalogues and snapping wisecracks during kitchen duty. ``It has a
sense of fun and a sense of reality,'' Norbu said. The director of
``The Cup,'' Khyentse Norbu, a high-ranking Buddhist lama from
Bhutan (who is no relation to Jamyang Norbu), knows the foibles of
young monks well, having taught in monasteries in Bhutan and India
for years. ``The romantic idea should stop now,'' Khyentse Norbu
said. ``In the West, people have higher expectations and see
Tibetans as holy and high _ people who don't eat and sleep. Sooner
or later, they're going to be disappointed. I'm trying to demystify
Tibetans.'' By Barbara Stewart. (Moved).  &QL;

which as a rule probably saves them disappointment, but every so
often a revelation comes along. A case in point: the Ukrainian
juggler Viktor Kee, 29, currently in San Francisco through next
Sunday with Cirque du Soleil's extravaganza, ``Dralion.'' His act
involves seven solid plastic balls, hand-molded by the artist
himself, which he not only sends flying in arcs that amaze the eye
but somehow also catches _ no hands _ on a shoulder, on a knee, on
the back of his neck. By Matthew Gurewitsch. (Moved).  &QL;

   ELTON-JOHN-AIDA (New York) _ No one was selling peanuts, and
instead of metal bars there were velvet ropes, but Elton John, the
evening's prize peacock, was being ogled as surely as if he were in
a zoo. It was Dec. 9, 1999, the opening-night performance of
Disney's ``Aida'' in Chicago _ a little more than three months
before the Broadway opening this Thursday at the Palace Theater.
The gawkers lined up, and watched, as if John was on the television
screen in their own homes. That is a by-product of celebrity, of
course. It's just that some of those gawkers also happened to be in
the cast or on the staff of ``Aida'' and they wanted a look, too.

   SUBURBIA-PHOTOGS (Undated) _ Considered a groundbreaking
exemplar of documentary photography upon its publication in 1972,
``Suburbia'' later went out of print, dropping off the radar in
much the same way its creator, Bill Owens, did. By the end of that
decade _ after showing at institutions like the Museum of Modern
Art and the Smithsonian, winning major awards and producing two
more books _ he decided he could no longer raise a family on a
photographer's wages and quit the art world. Now ``Suburbia'' is
available in a new edition, with a foreword by the journalist and
social historian David Halberstam, published late last year by
Fotofolio. And Owens, today better known as an authority on brewing
beer, is suddenly in vogue again, showing in major galleries from
New York to Paris and, through April 2, in a retrospective at the
San Jose Museum of Art in San Jose, Calif. By Jeffrey Kastner.

NASDAQ'S SIGN IS GREAT, BUT DOES ITS MARKET MEASURE UP? 
</HEADLINE>
  (Norris Column) 
(lh) 
 By FLOYD NORRIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The signs of Times Square have long been amazing.
Remember the cigarette billboard that blew perfect smoke rings? In
retrospect, the tobacco companies might have been better off today
if they had found another use for their money, but there is no
doubt that the sign impressed a lot of tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Today the most awe-inspiring sign is the $37 million Nasdaq
extravaganza on the corner of Broadway and 43rd Street. It
certainly gets Nasdaq noticed. So do all those television
commercials on football and basketball games.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, you have to wonder whether Nasdaq is spending its money
wisely. This is a time of upheaval in the securities markets, when
technological change has made it possible for new competitors to
arise _ and at least conceivable that the dominant markets now will
be eclipsed if they move too slowly to keep up.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the signs are that Nasdaq has been too busy
promoting itself as the home of all those high-tech wonder
companies to bother spending enough money on its services. The move
toward decimal prices for stocks is going to be delayed, perhaps
for many months, because Nasdaq computer systems are inadequate.
And Arthur Levitt, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, said Thursday that Nasdaq's SelectNet system, which
matches orders electronically, ``continues to be plagued with
shortcomings, delays during heavy trading volume, and even
outages.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank G. Zarb, the man brought in to run Nasdaq after the
scandal of a few years ago, doesn't like the new criticism.
``You're really being unfair,'' he told me Thursday. He argued that
Nasdaq spent a lot on better systems but that volume rose faster
than anyone expected, making it dangerous to convert to decimals
until system capacity improved. ``We're just asking for a saner
schedule,'' he said. As for SelectNet, he says the problems have
been fixed.
</P>
<P>
   In any industry facing rapid change, the dominant company often
wishes things would slow down. Nasdaq, for the first time in its
history, faces real competition from growing electronic markets for
trading volumes in Nasdaq-listed stocks. If it can't get its
systems in order, it may discover that marketing is no substitute
for capacity.
</P>
<P>
   For the time being, the big headlines regarding Nasdaq relate to
its volatility, not to its systems. The Nasdaq composite index hit
a record last Friday, having tripled in less than 18 months. By
11:11 a.m. Thursday it was down 11.8 percent from that peak. Then
it made up nearly half the loss in five hours. Up or down, Nasdaq
is where the action is, and the gamblers _ er, traders _ are
flocking to it.
</P>
<P>
   But change is coming. The electronic networks, which hitherto
operated as Nasdaq members rather than competitors, are talking of
becoming full-fledged exchanges. Archipelago's new link with the
Pacific Stock Exchange, announced this week, could make it a
formidable competitor _ particularly if the SEC manages to assure
that competition between markets benefits investors rather than the
brokers who are often tempted to compete with, rather than for,
their customers.
</P>
<P>
   Nasdaq is now trying to sell stock in itself. First comes a
private offering, which it is now pitching to a variety of
investors. If all goes well, a public offering will follow.
</P>
<P>
   In the offering memorandum for the deal, Nasdaq warns
prospective investors, in bold type, that ``System limitations and
failures could harm Nasdaq's business.''
</P>
<P>
   It got that right.

ST. PATRICK'S DAY MOOD CLOUDED BY EVENTS IN ULSTER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and w coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN AND KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It was meant to be what the Irish call a
``hooley,'' a grand party, a St. Patrick's Day that President
Clinton and Irish leaders could celebrate not only as Ireland's
national day, but as the first one in decades when Northern Ireland
was at peace and under local rule.
</P>
<P>
   The St. Patrick's Day events of this week, however, have instead
taken on the quality of another peculiarly Hibernian gathering: an
Irish wake. The peace process, while hardly dead, is in dire need
of resuscitation, and leaders on both sides of the Atlantic did not
seem optimistic that a cure would be found soon.
</P>
<P>
   Continuing a 20-year tradition, Clinton, members of Congress,
and Irish leaders sat Thursday for a traditional St. Patrick's Day
lunch _ this one, a day early to accommodate the legislative
schedule. There was prime rib, potatoes, green beans, and even dark
Guinness beer, unusual for a midday event on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   The key players were there: Ulster Unionist leader David
Trimble, Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern, and Sinn Fein president
Gerry Adams. Cardinal Law delivered the invocation, and Clinton
made a speech.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of what Clinton hoped to have _ a St. Patrick's
address congratulating all parties for their success in forging a
long-fought and hard-won peace _ all the president could do was
deliver what witnesses described as a wistful thanks for the
progress that had been made, and a plea that the warring parties
not allow things to regress.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton ``spoke from the heart,'' thanking the members of
Congress for their bipartisanship on Ireland amid an otherwise
bitterly partisan seven-plus years, said Representative Martin
Meehan, Democrat of Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   The president was ``a little melancholy,'' however, expressing
his great frustration and even anger, Meehan recounted.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble sat on one side of the room; his foe, Adams, was perched
on the other. When the luncheon ended about 80 minutes later, the
men departed the Capitol through separate doors.
</P>
<P>
   Ahern and Adams set off for separate meetings with key members
of Congress. Clinton, who Thursday night received the Millennium
Peace Award from the American Ireland Fund for his work on Northern
Ireland, is expected to meet with leaders in the peace process
Friday _ also separately.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm growing impatient,'' Peter Mandelson, the British state
secretary for Northern Ireland, told reporters in Washington
Thursday. ``The coming weeks will demand more courage and more
compromise. Everyone will have to take risks. Everyone will be
asked to stretch. Nobody will get exactly what they want.''
</P>
<P>
   At this stage, those close to the process say, the best hope is
that both sides will hold tightly to the progress that has been
made and not slip back to the bloody ``Troubles'' between Catholics
and Protestants that have ravaged Northern Ireland for the last 30
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not expect any major breakthroughs'' during the Irish
leaders' visit to Washington, said Michael Hammer, a spokesman for
the National Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   The British government last month suspended the fledgling
power-sharing government in Northern Ireland just 72 days after it
had handed power back to local politicians for the first time since
1974. Mandelson, who is leading the British delegation to
Washington, said he suspended the assembly to avert a threatened
walkout by the Ulster Unionists, who represent most Protestants.
</P>
<P>
   Adams, however, whose party is close to the IRA, said a unionist
disarmament deadline was unilateral and fell outside the terms of
the 1998 Good Friday Agreement. The accord, a compromise that
created political institutions intended to transform Northern
Ireland into a peaceful, democratic society, provides that all
paramilitary groups should be disarmed by May 2000. Adams accused
the British government of caving in to a unionist veto.
</P>
<P>
   In a Catch-22 for which no one has found an exit, the IRA says
it will not discuss disarming until the power-sharing government is
restored, while unionists say they will not sit in government with
Sinn Fein until the IRA begins disarming.
</P>
<P>
   ``If David Trimble advances the mantra, `no guns, no
government,' you can be sure the IRA response will be `no
government, no guns,' '' said Representative Richard Neal, Democrat
of Springfield, who confers frequently with Clinton on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Exploiting the political vacuum, dissident Irish republican and
British loyalist paramilitary groups have stepped up their
activities in the past month. The republicans are trying to set off
bombs, hoping it would lead to a collapse of the peace process,
while loyalists are busy trying to settle some lethal internecine
scores and continue to kill ordinary Catholics occasionally in what
seems an attempt to goad the Irish Republican Army into breaking
its cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   Britain did make a conciliatory gesture Thursday, as Mandelson
announced that more troops were being pulled out of Northern
Ireland. The pullout means that for the first time since 1969,
there will be no British batallion resident in Belfast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, elsewhere the security profile is higher,''
Mandelson said. ``But that is because elsewhere the level of threat
is higher.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams downplayed the move as ``cynical,'' though welcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always glad to see British troops going home,'' he said in
an interview. ``But I have to say that I'm quite cynical about the
timing of the announcement. A little media announcement on St.
Patrick's Day in Washington isn't what's required here.''
</P>
<P>
   Mandelson, meanwhile, criticized the IRA for failing to give up
its weapons, calling it ``a stumbling block'' to peace.
</P>
<P>
   Turning in weapons ``remains an essential part of the peace
process,'' he said. ``I know that people have fears, fears that
they will be asked to move first, or make bigger sacrifices than
the other side.''
</P>
<P>
   But those who ``retreat into those fears . . . will pay a heavy
price for their insularity,'' Mandelson said.

OLYMPICS CONTINUE TO LURE CORPORATE SPONSORS

<P>
   In the end, the Olympics simply proved too attractive as a
marketing platform for major corporations to resist.
</P>
<P>
   A year after scandals wracked the International Olympic
Committee and the Salt Lake Organizing Committee, IOC officials
said Thursday that their most loyal sponsor, Eastman Kodak, has
extended its relationship with the games through 2008. They added a
few more current sponsors will renew their agreements in the next
several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really back to business as usual,'' said Robert Madrigal,
professor at the Warsaw Sports Marketing Center at the University
of Oregon. ``The Olympics are just way too valuable for companies,
and the core idea of what the Olympics are about and what the
companies are buying has not been damaged.''
</P>
<P>
   After the disclosure last year of a $1.2 million campaign to
give gifts to the Salt Lake Organizing Committee during the effort
to locate the 2002 Winter Games in Utah, 10 IOC members resigned or
were expelled. Earlier this week, a former member of the US Olympic
Committee pleaded guilty to federal tax violations in connection
with the organization of both the Salt Lake games and the 2004
Summer Games in Rome.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the major corporate sponsors headed for cover during the
scandals, refusing to comment. Others would say only that they were
monitoring the events. Only David D'Alessandro, president and chief
operating officer of John Hancock Financial Services Inc. went
public with his chagrin, eventually threatening to pull the
company's sponsorship.
</P>
<P>
   But, for the corporations, the Olympic rings never lost their
luster.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the problems were focused on the athletes _ a drug scandal,
or something that directly affected the competition _ that might
have made a difference,'' Madrigal said. ``But this was about
things financial, the business of the Olympics, not the games
themselves.''
</P>

   On Tuesday, D'Alessandro directed Hancock employees to restore
the rings to Hancock's stationary. Last month, after obtaining a
morals clause in Hancock's agreement with the IOC, allowing the
company to withdraw if more troubles occur, the company renewed its
sponsorship through 2004 for $55 million.

   Kodak has sponsored every Olympics since the first of the
corporate-backed games in 1896. Company officials said Thursday the
Olympics provide a unique medium to show off Kodak's new products
to the world. Kodak will build and operate a huge photo lab at the
summer games to support the thousands of journalists who attend,
and make available its new digital technology to supply
accreditation badges to 200,000 officials, athletes, sponsors,
volunteers and workers who will attend the games in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   Sports sponsorship specialists pegged the value of the agreement
at about $110 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the sixth TOP (The Olympic Partners) sponsorship that
we have announced, and our target is 10,'' said Michael Payne, the
IOC's marketing director, referring to the highest level of Olympic
sponsorship. ``We are confident we will meet or exceed that before
the games in Sydney.''
</P>
<P>
   Sources said negotiations are nearly complete with some of the
five current TOP sponsors, whose agreements expire this year:
McDonalds, UPS, Panasonic, Samsung and Xerox. A UPS spokeswoman
said Thursday, however, that negotiations with the IOC had not
begun.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've essentially reached agreement with several of them, in
negotiations,'' Payne said. ``As soon as we get the lawyers to
behave, we'll be executing those agreements and making the
announcments.''
</P>
<P>
   The companies which had already renewed are Coca-Cola Inc. and
SEMA Group, through 2008; and Sports Illustrated/Time Inc., Visa
International Corp. and Hancock.
</P>
<P>
   Kodak and IOC officials refused to comment Thursday on whether
their agreement includes a morals clause similar to Hancock's. But
observers said they believed several companies negotiating with the
IOC have followed Hancock's lead, and insisted on some way of
voiding their agreements if the image of the games is damaged.

AGING JAPANESE TERRORIST TRIES TO AVOID DEPORTATION FROM LEBANON 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By JOHN F. BURNS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRUT, Lebanon _ He calls himself Ahmed now, having taken a
Muslim first name two weeks ago when he converted to Islam in a
Lebanese prison, trying again to shake off the shackles of his
past.
</P>
<P>
   But not even a change of name and faith _ nor even the
widespread popular following he has developed in Lebanon, a country
with a majority Muslim population _ seems likely to bring lasting
relief to the 52-year-old man formerly known as Kozo Okamoto.
</P>
<P>
   On May 30, 1972, Okamoto was one of three Japanese Red Army
members who pulled machine guns and grenades from bags coming off
an Air France flight from Rome at Israel's international airport
near Lod. In the ensuing carnage, 26 people were killed, including
16 Puerto Rican Roman Catholics on a pilgrimage to the Holy Land,
and 74 were injured. Two of the Japanese attackers were also
killed.
</P>
<P>
   Okamoto survived and was sentenced to life in prison by an
Israeli court. He served 13 years before being released in a
prisoner exchange with Palestinians in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   The Lod massacre was one of the deadliest of its time. But as in
many other events that have strained relations between Israel and
its Arab neighbors, the prism of politics has transformed what
happened that day into legend among impassioned Arabs. For many in
Lebanon and elsewhere in the Arab world, Okamoto became a hero, so
much so that he is now at the center of a diplomatic tug of war.
Japan wants to extradite him to face trial for terrorism and acts
against the state at home, and Lebanon bowed to popular feeling
this month and rejected the Japanese request.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for Okamoto, and for four other Japanese Red Army
members who along with him have just completed three-year jail
sentences in Lebanon for living here on forged passports, the
Beirut government's finding that Japan's extradition bid ``lacked
enough evidence'' and fell outside Lebanon's statute of limitations
did not end the matter. While a parliamentary committee headed by
Interior Minister Michel Murr considers the prisoners' requests for
political asylum, Lebanon is scouring the world for any country _
Cuba has been mentioned, as have North Korea and Libya _ that might
accept them.
</P>
<P>
   It is a humiliating postscript for a group that once bestrode
the world of international terrorism. From the early 1970s until
the late 1980s, when its flame finally flickered out, the Red Army,
formed in 1971 by a group of Marxist students, made common cause
with Ilich Ramirez Sanchez, known as Carlos the Jackal, the
terrorist now imprisoned in France who is said to have been a
planner of the Lod airport attack. It also worked with other groups
that struck fear with aircraft hijackings, assassinations, embassy
takeovers and bombings, like the Popular Front for the Liberation
of Palestine-General Command, the Italian Red Brigades and the
Baader-Meinhof gang in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's eagerness to put the five on trial _ evident in the
dozens of Japanese reporters and television crews covering the case
here, more than doubling the resident Japanese population _
reflects years of frustration.
</P>
<P>
   According to Japanese officials, only five of the 40 to 50
Japanese who formed the core of the Red Army ever ended up in
Japanese jails, and only a handful of the group's activists died in
the dozens of terrorist attacks it mounted in Japan and around the
world. Apart from the five held in Lebanon, there are at least
seven others on Japan's wanted list, including the woman who is
believed to have been the Red Army's leader, Fusako Shigenobu, 54.
She is thought to have gone into hiding somewhere in the former
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   According to Lebanon's prosecutor general, Adnan Addoum, who
recommended that the government refuse Japan's extradition request
and deport the five Japanese to a third country, Okamoto is now
``only half a man,'' weakened to the point of debility by years of
harsh treatment and torture in Israeli prisons.
</P>
<P>
   His poor condition is cited as the reason he is sitting out a
hunger strike begun last week by three of his comrades, who are now
in a hospital. The fifth prisoner, Masao Adachi, a 60-year-old
former film director who is also sitting out the hunger strike, is
said to be needed to help feed and care for Okamoto.
</P>
<P>
   In their determination to avoid a forced return to Japan, the
five have shown some ingenuity. As his prison term for using a
false passport neared its end, Okamoto, shown in recent photographs
to be salt-and-pepper gray now, with a goatee, did what he could to
whip up support, sending letters to supporters in which he declared
himself, in effect, an honorary Arab.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the Lod operation,'' he said, ``I have earned the right
to be considered a citizen of all Arab countries.'' The attack, he
said in another pronouncement, was ``to support and defend the
cause of the oppressed.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, on March 2, five days before their prison terms were
officially to have ended, three of the five converted to Islam, and
summoned one of Lebanon's most eminent Sunni Muslim clerics, Sheik
Ahmed Al Kurdi, to sanction the conversion in prison. In addition
to Okamoto, they were Kazuo Tohira, 47, who now calls himself
Bassem, and Mariko Yamamoto, the only woman in the group, 59, who
took the name Maryam. A few days later, they petitioned the
Lebanese government for permission to join the pilgrimage to Mecca
in Saudi Arabia, a huge annual migration, now under way, that is
considered the greatest fulfillment for any Muslim.
</P>
<P>
   A fourth member of the group used the same tactic, but with a
different twist. Adachi, the former filmmaker, converted to the
Greek Orthodox branch of Christianity and persuaded prison
authorities to allow him to marry a 35-year-old Lebanese Christian
woman who works as an acupuncturist, Ummaya Abboud. She was living
with him in 1997 in Lebanon's Bekaa region, along the Syrian border
east of Beirut, when he and the other four Japanese were picked up
in a Lebanese police sweep in February 1997. Only one member of the
group, Haruo Wako, 51, refused to convert, telling prison officials
he would not stoop to a ``transparent ploy.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Red Army professed Marxist beliefs, all five of the
Japanese previously listed their faith with prison authorities as
Buddhist.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, the Lebanese authorities are holding the five in
prison under 15-day renewable detention orders, but a decision to
let them remain in Lebanon or to deport them is thought to be
imminent.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Libya received Okamoto as a hero when he arrived there after his
release by Israel in 1985, printing front-page photographs in its
newspapers of him being hoisted atop the shoulders of Palestinian
militants in Tripoli. But it has cooled to its onetime protege,
apparently because Col. Moammar Gadhafi, the Libyan leader, is
eager to end Libya's diplomatic isolation and attract new
investment in Libya's oil and gas fields. Libya was apparently glad
to see the back of Okamoto when he went to Lebanon sometime in the
late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The situation confronts Lebanese leaders with a vexatious
choice. After a devastating civil war that lasted 15 years _
killing at least 130,000 by its end in 1990 and turning the Bekaa
into a terrorist haventhat benefited from the total lawlessness of
wartime _ Lebanon is only now struggling to its feet again. It is
desperate to establish itself as a responsible member of the
international community, and eager for foreign investment,
especially from Japan, one of the largest investors here before the
war.
</P>
<P>
   Nor does it want to put at risk a $120 million low-interest loan
pledged by Japan, whose prime minister, Keizo Obuchi, sent a
personal emissary here in December to argue for the Red Army
group's extradition.
</P>
<P>
   Unedifying as the group's history may seem to the countries that
were its victims, its popularity in Lebanon _ or Okamoto's, at
least _ is undeniable. For the last week, a group of Beirut
University students have maintained a round-the-clock vigil outside
the Interior Ministry in the heart of the Lebanese capital,
demanding political asylum for Okamoto. Cars passing the spot in
the heavy Beirut traffic frequently honk their horns in support.
Some 20,000 people are said to have signed a petition in support of
asylum for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kozo didn't go to Lod airport just for the fun of killing, he
went there for the cause of all Arabs,'' Huda Hafez, a 23-year-old
English literature major at Lebanese University, told a reporter.
``Why do you Westerners always think only of the innocents who died
in Israel, and not of the thousands of innocent Arabs that the
Israelis have killed?''

<P>
   In the end, the Olympics simply proved too attractive as a
marketing platform for major corporations to resist.
</P>
<P>
   A year after scandals wracked the International Olympic
Committee and the Salt Lake Organizing Committee, IOC officials
said Thursday that their most loyal sponsor, Eastman Kodak, has
extended its relationship with the games through 2008. They added a
few more current sponsors will renew their agreements in the next
several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really back to business as usual,'' said Robert Madrigal,
professor at the Warsaw Sports Marketing Center at the University
of Oregon. ``The Olympics are just way too valuable for companies,
and the core idea of what the Olympics are about and what the
companies are buying has not been damaged.''
</P>
<P>
   After the disclosure last year of a $1.2 million campaign to
give gifts to the Salt Lake Organizing Committee during the effort
to locate the 2002 Winter Games in Utah, 10 IOC members resigned or
were expelled. Earlier this week, a former member of the US Olympic
Committee pleaded guilty to federal tax violations in connection
with the organization of both the Salt Lake games and the 2004
Summer Games in Rome.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the major corporate sponsors headed for cover during the
scandals, refusing to comment. Others would say only that they were
monitoring the events. Only David D'Alessandro, president and chief
operating officer of John Hancock Financial Services Inc. went
public with his chagrin, eventually threatening to pull the
company's sponsorship.
</P>
<P>
   But, for the corporations, the Olympic rings never lost their
luster.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the problems were focused on the athletes _ a drug scandal,
or something that directly affected the competition _ that might
have made a difference,'' Madrigal said. ``But this was about
things financial, the business of the Olympics, not the games
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, D'Alessandro directed Hancock employees to restore
the rings to Hancock's stationary. Last month, after obtaining a
morals clause in Hancock's agreement with the IOC, allowing the
company to withdraw if more troubles occur, the company renewed its
sponsorship through 2004 for $55 million.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ If you thought that this week's spate of off-Broadway
closings might do something to ease the theater crunch, think
again.
</P>
<P>
   The producers of both ``Wit,'' at the Union Square Theater, and
``Hedwig and the Angry Inch,'' at the Jane Street Theater,
announced they would close on April 9. But just as quickly, both
theaters had new bookings.
</P>
<P>
   At the Jane Street, as expected, ``Wake Up and Smell the
Coffee,'' a new work by Eric Bogosian, will begin previews on April
24 with a May 4 opening. His wife, Jo Bonney, will direct; Fred
Zollo and Nick Paleologos will produce. The piece, Bogosian's first
solo show since 1994, includes an array of characters and concepts
including airlines, Jesus and overpriced java. (More on this
later.)
</P>
<P>
   Late Thursday, the producer Roy Gabay said that the next tenant
at the Union Square would be ``The Laramie Project,'' a dramatic
meditation on the 1998 killing of Matthew Shepard, a gay college
student, directed by Moises Kaufman.
</P>
<P>
   The piece, written by Kaufman's ensemble, opened to strong
reviews at the Denver Theater Center on Feb. 26 and is scheduled to
run there until April 1. Immediately thereafter, the show will
transfer to the Union Square, with performances likely to begin the
last week of April. Opening night will be in mid-May.
</P>
<P>
   The question here was not if but when. The piece opened at the
Denver Theater Center on Feb. 26 and is scheduled to run there
until April 1.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to move the piece came after several days of back
and forth deliberation between Kaufman and Gabay.
</P>
<P>
   Arguments for the immediate move revolve around the play's early
momentum, including glowing reviews in Denver and advance features
in the New York press. On the other hand producers worry about the
timing of a possible opening, reasoning that the work's serious
subject matter might not play in the summer months or that a
crowded Broadway Tony season could limit its impact. in.''
</P>
<P>
   FEAR OF FLYING
</P>
<P>
   Eric Bogosian doesn't want you to think he's gotten soft.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not mellow,'' he said, ``I like being fierce, and what
makes me laugh is what I'm going to put onstage.''
</P>
<P>
   That said, he admits that there's something slightly different
about ``Wake Up and Smell the Coffee,'' most notably the structure,
which he calls ``more stream-of-consciousness.'' He has also added
several leit-motifs, including air travel, a phenomenon he sees as
summing up the American experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wait in line to hurry up,'' he said. ``And then's there's
the fear of crashing at any moment.''
</P>
<P>
   TRUE NEW?
</P>
<P>
   It's Broadway's newest hit, to be sure. But is ``True West'' a
new play?
</P>
<P>
   That's a question that may well end up before the Tony
administration committee in coming weeks. While the answer may seem
self-evident, producers of the play, a 1980 black comedy by Sam
Shepard, are mulling whether to ask Tony voters formally to
consider their production as eligible for the award for best new
play.
</P>
<P>
   How? Well, Tony rules stipulate that, regardless of age,
productions can be considered ``new'' provided that they have never
appeared on Broadway. ``True West,'' which opened to raves on March
9, never has, although a 1982 production ran for well over a year
Off Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   OK, then: Why? Well, although producers are mum on the matter,
the reasoning would seem to be that the prospective Tony
competition in the new-play category would be less formidable than
that in the revival category, where the acclaimed British import
``The Real Thing'' is considered an early favorite.
</P>
<P>
   As such, the ``True West'' move would just be the latest chapter
in a long and sometimes ludicrous history of Tony jockeying. It is
also a topic Shepard is familiar with. In 1996 his 1979 play,
``Buried Child,'' successfully lobbied the Tony committee to be
considered a new play on the grounds that it had been substantially
rewritten. It won the decision but lost the award.
</P>
<P>
   As for the immediate future of ``True West,'' its two stars are
booked through mid-June, and discussions have begun about a
possible extension.
</P>
<P>
   THE FARMER'S STRIFE
</P>
<P>
   First came ``Iceman.'' Now comes ``Moon.'' Next up is
``Desire.''
</P>
<P>
   Devotees of Eugene O'Neill will understand the shorthand. Last
year saw the return of O'Neill's ``Iceman Cometh.'' A revival of
his ``Moon for the Misbegotten'' opens on Sunday, and in October
the Roundabout Theater Company will produce ``Desire Under the
Elms,'' a tale of Oedipal angst involving a farmer and his son,
each enamored of the father's young wife, Abbie.
</P>
<P>
   The director of ``Desire'' will be David Leveaux, who made his
name at age 26 with a 1984 Broadway production of ``Moon'' and
burnished it with a production of another O'Neill drama, ``Anna
Christie,'' in 1993. No casting yet, but Leveaux said he intended
to pursue Mary Louise Parker, who played Abbie in a reading last
fall.
</P>
<P>
   He added that he intended to explore the themes of sex and
language in ``Desire.'' ``I think it works to strip it back to the
basics,'' Leveaux said. ``Once you get back to those literal
relationships, you get what flies in the theater.''
</P>
<P>
   JUST IN TIME, TOO
</P>
<P>
   Another major revival has been sighted: ``Bells are Ringing,''
is aiming for a March 2001 Broadway opening. The director is
something of a surprise: Tina Landau, the force behind experimental
works like ``Floyd Collins'' and ``Space.'' Landau has directed
``Bells'' twice before, at Yale University's annual Dramat and at
the Kennedy Center in Washington in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a constant karmic companion in my life,'' she said,
with a laugh. ``I intend to watch the old tapes and steal from
myself.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1956 musical, by Jule Styne, Betty Comden and Adolph Green,
follows the romance of an answering-service operator, originally
played by Judy Holliday, who falls for one of her clients. The
producers this time around are Mitchell Maxwell, Mark Balsam,
Victoria Maxwell and Robert Barandes.

RAYTHEON SEEKS UK MISSILE CONTRACT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Raytheon Co.'s priority target: the Royal Air Force.
</P>
<P>
   The British military is reviewing bids for a new air-to-air
missile program, and the Massachusetts defense contractor is
lobbying fiercely to snare a contract worth about $1.6 billion. Its
competitor is a mostly European consortium that also wants to arm
the UK's new Eurofighter warplane.
</P>
<P>
   An official decision by Britain's Labor government is expected
as soon as next week, and a win would help Raytheon reverse its
recent slump, showing it can still land the lucrative overseas
contracts that historically have generated much of its profits.
</P>
<P>
   Losing the contract wouldn't break Raytheon, which had revenue
of around $20 billion last year. But the company and its chief
executive, Daniel Burnham, could use some good news after a string
of earnings disappointments and technical setbacks in some of its
programs combined to depress Raytheon's share price. The company's
class B shares closed at $19.50, up 25 cents, but still are less
than one-third of their July high of $74.9375.
</P>
<P>
   The slump has tested the leadership of Burnham, who has
reorganized the company and taken criticism from employees after
ordering thousands of job cuts since he took over in 1998. A win
for Raytheon would also lighten the mood in the Pentagon, whose
shifting procurement policies, some say, are partly to blame for
the woes of the defense industry.
</P>
<P>
   But the British Ministry of Defense could still opt for a
competing missile system known as ``Meteor'' under development by a
group that includes British Aerospace and France's Aerospatiale
Matra.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever wins the British contract would probably receive
billions of dollars worth of future missile orders from other
European countries as well. Combined with potential US purchases,
the total market for the new missile could be as many as 15,000
over 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   If the European group wins the British contract, it would also
gain a foothold in the global missile market, which Raytheon has
dominated since it acquired Hughes Electronics in 1997. Since the
end of the Cold War, European governments have been under
increasing pressure to support local industries and bolster
economic cooperation across the continent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The British decision will tell us a lot about the future
course of European economic integration, and what the market will
be for American defense contractors looking forward,'' said Loren
Thompson, director of national security programs at the Lexington
Institute in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   NATO countries are still the biggest weapons buyers, he said.
``If (US) companies can't make an impact there, there's not much
left in the rest of the world,'' Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   The marketing war is proceeding on both technical and political
fronts.
</P>
<P>
   Under its proposal, Raytheon would upgrade an existing missile
design in stages through 2008, adding first an advanced rocket
motor and later, perhaps, some type of ``ramjet'' engine that would
require less fuel. ``It's clear we've got the more flexible
offering,'' said Peter McKee, director of Raytheon Systems Ltd.,
the company's British subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the Meteor team proposes to begin work on a ramjet
immediately, which it says would lead to the creation of a more
powerful and agile missile.
</P>
<P>
   Some think a Raytheon win unlikely, since the company used up
many political chits in London and Washington last year to win a
$1.3 billion UK radar contract. But Raytheon's current missile bid
is being promoted by President Clinton and Defense Secretary
William Cohen, who recently told his British counterpart that it
would be ``neither feasible nor prudent'' for the United States to
cooperate on Meteor's development.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen's statement came as a snub to Boeing Co., which is part of
the Meteor team.
</P>
<P>
   But Meteor's members have official backing from Germany and
Spain, which will be looking to arm Eurofighters of their own soon.
The European consortium isn't afraid to tweak Raytheon as an
outsider, calling the company ``a threat from Arizona'' in a trade
press advertisement last fall, a reference to the Tucson factories
where Raytheon produces many of its missiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the nastiest competition I've seen in years,'' said
Larry Dickerson, defense analyst at Forecast International in
Newtown, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   For the Europeans, the outcome could suggest whether defense
forces there will continue to use mainly American equipment, he
said. ``It's gone from being a battle about the technical
requirements to a question of whether Europe is going to remain
unified and all the emotions that come with that,'' Dickerson said.
</P>
<P>
   The Royal Air Force is set to take its first Eurofighter
deliveries in 2002 and the first contract proposal requests for
air-to-air missiles to arm the planes came several years ago. At
the time, British officials were spooked by a Russian missile
design based around an engine known as a ramjet, which burns oxygen
from the atmosphere in addition to the fuel supply it carries.
</P>
<P>
   In theory the design offers greater range and speed than an
existing Raytheon armament known as the Advanced Medium Range
Air-to-Air Missile, or AMRAAM, a mainstay of the US and NATO air
fleets today. Raytheon's bid for the $1.6 billion contract calls
for supplying an updated version of the AMRAAM.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly how close the Russian ramjet is to deployment isn't
clear. Raytheon says it has been told by American and British
intelligence officials that the Russians aren't proceeding with the
expensive design; analysts estimate it would cost several hundred
million dollars at least for France's Aerospatiale to develop such
an engine of its own.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon says it could design its missile around the French
motor by 2008 if needed. In the meantime, Raytheon proposes to
build for the British an interim missile whose range would be
midway between the Meteor ramjet's reach of around 70 miles and
AMRAAM's current 20-mile range. The interim design would make use
of a ``pulse'' rocket motor that could be switched off and on
again, producing a more agile weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon's McKee called the proposal an example of ``smart
procurement'' because it would allow the British to put off a
decision whether to pay to develop the ramjet missile, perhaps
until a superior technology emerges. ``In 10 years' time there's
likely to be a better way of doing it in any event,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   British Aerospace spokesman Charles Miller counters that work on
the ramjet should begin as soon as possible, and that the creation
of a competitor to Raytheon would mean cheaper and better weapons
in the long run.
</P>
<P>
   ``Raytheon has put forward a very strong proposal, but one of
our arguments has been that Raytheon wouldn't have put forward such
a strong bid if there hadn't been competition already,'' Miller
said.

DOW ADDS 500 POINTS IN BIGGEST ONE-DAY GAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average shot up almost 500 points
Thursday, its biggest one-day point gain ever, as investors rushed
to buy consumer, drug, and financial stocks they had shunned for
the past two months.
</P>
<P>
   The gain brought the two-day rise in the Dow to a remarkable 819
points, or more than 8 percent. It was the average's most
spectacular rally since rebounding from the stock-market crash of
1987.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow closed at 10,630.6, up 499.19 points, after an exuberant
day on Wall Street, where computer screens flashed stock prices in
a blanket of green _ for rising stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow's powerful move also pulled up technology stocks, which
had flirted with a correction in three frenzied trading days this
week. The Nasdaq Composite stock index, which is dominated by
high-flying technology firms, rose 134.77 points, or nearly 3
percent, and closed at 4717.39.
</P>
<P>
   But the Dow was the star. The 30-stock index, which has come to
symbolize the old-fashioned economy, suddenly looked appealing to
investors seeking bargains in companies with profits as an
alternative to overpriced, money-losing technology companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was high time we had a snapback in these tremendously
depressed `old economy' stocks,'' said William Lawrence, senior
vice president of Beacon Fiduciary Advisors in Boston. ``They had
been beaten down to levels that were below where they should've
been.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither a government report that wholesale prices had their
biggest monthly rise in nine years, nor prospects of an interest
rate hike next Tuesday by the Federal Reserve, could dampen
enthusiasm for stocks. Producer prices surged 1 percent in
February, driven by spiraling oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   Several companies that make up the Dow index, such as Citigroup,
Merck &AMP; Co., Home Depot Inc., and Minnesota Mining &AMP; Manufacturing
Co., posted gains of between $4 and $6 per share.
</P>
<P>
   Rising stocks outnumbered declining stocks by a 7-to-2 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street veteran Harry Laubscher said the money going into
the Dow was ``coming out of'' technology stocks. Some analysts
speculated that Nasdaq stocks may be past their heyday and face
extreme volatility and _ in certain stocks _ sharp declines as
investors see through promises and start demanding profits.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the only two stocks in the Dow index that declined were
Hewlett-Packard and Microsoft Corp. IBM Corp. squeezed out a small
gain.
</P>
<P>
   Laubscher, an analyst at the brokerage firm of Tucker Anthony
Inc. in New York, noted the Dow has now recovered half of the
losses suffered as it slid from a Jan. 14 high of 11,723 to a low
of 9796 last week. ``A two-thirds recovery would be a bull
market,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow's second-largest one-day rise occurred Sept. 8, 1998,
when the stock market rose 380 points in the midst of a
full-fledged bull market.
</P>
<P>
   Market observers said what might be happening this week is a
phenomenon known as a a bear-market rally: Investors are buying on
the dips, though it is less clear whether they are optimistic about
the market's future overall or just betting on individual stocks.
In particular, institutional investors such as mutual funds and
pension managers, which are required to be fully invested in the
stock market, see a slump in the Dow as an opportunity to make
long-term investments.
</P>
<P>
   Traders said some of the market's extreme volatility was due to
Friday's simultaneous expiration of options and futures in stocks
and stocks indexes, an event known on Wall Street as a ``triple
witching.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq Composite index ended its three-day losing streak as
investors dived back into technology stocks that had been hammered
earlier in the week. Some of the buying may be have been caused by
continued speculation by day traders and aggressive individual
investors.
</P>
<P>
   Veritas Software Corp., after being crushed earlier this week,
rose more than $18.3125 a share, to $151.75. The world's largest
chip maker, Intel Corp., gained $4.875 a share, closing at
$125.0625. Biotechnology stocks, which rebounded Wednesday, rose
again Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Rallies in both the Nasdaq and the Dow on the same day has
become unusual in a year in which the two indexes frequently move
in opposite directions. On Wednesday, the Dow's huge gain was
countered by a 124-point fall in the Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   ``For once the Dow has actually pulled the Nasdaq along with
it,'' said Ned Riley, chief investment strategist for State Street
Global Advisors, division of State Street Corp. ``That's more
balanced.''

 &HT;    Updates throughout
 &HT;    The making of an Atlanta boy band
 &HT;    By Miriam Longino and Richard L. Eldredge
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Last August, six teenage boys from rather ordinary
homes in Atlanta's ring of suburbs sat down at a conference table
in Alpharetta, Ga., and opened up a white three-ring binder that
contained a 60-page business plan. It spelled out how they were
going to become rich and famous in two years as the Next Great Boy
Band in America. Pared down to its essence, says one, the idea was
to:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Learn to sing in harmony.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Learn to dance in sync.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Perform at places such as Six Flags and the Mall of Georgia,
and make every little girl who happens to pause and watch you
believe she's special, and that you're singing to her. Just her.
(It helps to sign autographs and hand out roses.)
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Make an album, and shoot a video _ which is what brought the
group to the heart of Buckhead, Atlanta's entertainment district,
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   It's March 11 and the members of 6 Piece are standing in the
rain, emoting into the camera and lip-syncing their way into the
American pop consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   The scene is somewhat surreal. The six teens, dressed in leather
Avirex athletic jackets purchased at a local mall, stand at
bewildered attention while a makeup artist dabs their baby faces.
</P>
<P>
   One is a little worried, and asks, ``Do I look like I have 10
pounds of lipstick on?''
</P>
<P>
   A boombox begins blasting a thump-beat love song that sounds
like a cross between All-4-0ne's ``I Swear'' and Cher's electronic
vocal noodling on her recent hit ``Believe'' _ ``My first, my last,
I'm gonna love you forever.'' On cue, the guys launch into a kind
of sexy dip/bounce that seems oddly out of place in front of the
old facade of the Roxy Theatre. Bizarrely, the whole thing is
nearly drowned out by the pounding horns of the Tucker High School
marching band high-stepping its way through the Dazz Band's ``Let
It Whip,'' part of a St. Patrick's Day Parade which,
coincidentally, is weaving its way through Buckhead.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin, Alex, Brandon, Bobby, Micah and John aren't household
names yet _ but they're working on it. These six kids from
Alpharetta, Lilburn, Ga., Cumming, Ga., and Loganville, Ga., who
just a year ago were roaming the malls or pondering their scores on
the SAT, have become Atlanta's answer to the Backstreet Boys and 'N
Sync. Or at least their creator Maurice Starr _ who is also
manager/producer/songwriter _ hopes so.
</P>
<P>
   Starr, the 46-year-old Svengali who essentially invented the
formula of packaging squeaky clean white kids as hip-hop performers
in 1986, when he assembled New Kids on the Block, is back in the
game. After watching his own proteges turn acts such as Backstreet
Boys into multimillion-dollar hit machines, he emerged from his
Alpharetta recording studio (where he has been quietly producing
gospel acts for five years) and went looking for another set of
boys with potential to shape into stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like baking a cake,'' he says, watching his six young
students point and wink and move their hands like a maitre d'
inviting someone to sit down to dinner. ``New Kids on the Block
were a cake ... Everything starts from a vision, an embryo.
Everybody can fry chicken, but the man who started KFC had his own
style. This is my recipe for cooking up a boy band.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr began assembling his ingredients last spring when he
passed out fliers at area high schools to recruit teens who would
be willing to essentially turn their lives over to him for two
years. He personally screened about 200 calls, narrowing his search
by asking three questions: ``How tall are you? How much do you
weigh? And are you good-looking?''
</P>
<P>
   Next, Starr held auditions at his home studio, where he watched
the teens mimic song lyrics and dance steps. Following the boy band
recipe _ which calls for a diversity of boy types _ he knew what he
needed. First on board was 19-year-old Kevin Swan, a part-time
model with lady-killer looks who Starr decided would be the group's
``heartbreaker.''
</P>
<P>
   Kevin describes his style this way: ``I wear 10 rings.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At first my friends and my parents were real skeptical,'' the
teen says politely, his responses peppered with ``Yes ma'ams.''
``They never expected to hear us on the radio or see our CD in
stores. Now they are as mind-boggled and excited as I am _ `My
son's gonna be a superstar!'''
</P>
<P>
   Then Starr found his wisecracking rebel (John), his good buddy
(Bobby), the baby-faced innocent (Micah), the swarthy crooner with
creative facial hair (Alex) and the all-important sixth member
(Brandon), who still seems to be searching for his role in the
group. But Brandon's presence was essential to Starr in order to
make 6 Piece different from the glut of boy bands saturating the
marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody else looks the same because they've got five guys,''
he says matter-of-factly. ``We're gonna look different on TV
because we've got six.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the group was assembled, Starr began holding rehearsals
seven days a week, six hours a day. Contracts were signed, with the
boys relying on an entertainment lawyer and their parents to carve
out their end of the deal. According to Kevin, Starr gets 20
percent as manager and the guys split 10 percent between the six of
them. He says the rest goes to Starr's independent label, Starr
</P>
<P>
   -works, and for promotion and marketing.
</P>
<P>
   But there was another expectation, perhaps more important than
any conventional music business game plan. The guys had to develop
a fan base _ before their music was ever on the radio.
</P>
<P>
   How? By aiming straight for the hearts of girls.
</P>
<P>
   Going for girl buzz
</P>
<P>
   Like a pop version of Amway or Mary Kay Cosmetics, Starr's plan
relies on young girls to chat up 6 Piece to their friends. There
are hundreds of them here today, as VIP extras on the video shoot,
shivering in the rain. They are waiting to catch the eye of their
favorite 6 Piecer. Wearing tight short skirts, low-waisted
bell-bottoms, platform shoes and more halter tops than a
``Baywatch'' episode, they hang around the stairway near the
dressing area at the Celebrity Rock Cafe, swapping 6 Piece stories
like salesmen at a convention.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen-year-old Niki Sexton of Lawrenceville, Ga., and Rachel
Cook, 13, of Kennesaw, Ga., explain how it works.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're on the Promote Team,'' Rachel says.
</P>
<P>
   The Promote Team?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah. Each guy picked 10 girls to be part of the Promote
Team,'' Niki explains. ``They give us stuff to hand out. Like when
Bobby from the band gave me these black cards (forms to pre-order
the group's album) and told me to run down the mall, and I went
into stores and yelled `Come see these hot, fine guys!'''
</P>
<P>
   Over the months, Starr has trotted out 6 Piece on small stages
all over the Atlanta area. As girls stop to watch, the young
performers use the careful training Starr has gven them to work the
crowd. After the show, rather than ducking into a dressing room or
being whisked off in a limo, Kevin, Micah, Bobby, Brandon, John and
Alex hang around and talk with their fans. They exchange e-mail
addresses and collect names for a mailing list to notify the girls
where they will appear next. A slickly designed Web site
(www.6pieceonline.com) also contains direct e-mail links to each
boy in the group. Kevin says each time he sits down at his
computer, he has ``at least 100'' messages from this fan base.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think about it,'' Starr says over a bacon cheeseburger at
Johnny Rockets, on break from the video shoot. ``You do this all
across the country. You get 100,000 of them, and each buys 10
records, what's that? Platinum.''
</P>
<P>
   The entire scene here could be a documentary on the lure _ or
perhaps more accurately, the illusion _ of fame. Plop any one of
these guys down at Publix or the Gap, and it's unlikely anyone
would know who they are. But behind the velvet rope sealing them
off from fans, these young stars in the making seem special.
</P>
<P>
   Older teen girls pump their hips to loud rap lyrics _ ``move it
move it move it'' _ waiting for the members of 6 Piece to lean over
a balcony railing. Alex playfully takes off his shirt, setting off
high-pitched screams. The others wander down into the crowd and
invite girls to join them behind the velvet rope. Outside in the
rain, a girl in a black tube-top dashes for cover while trying to
protect the autographs _ she got all six! _ scrawled on her upper
body in magic marker. Everyone is caught up. Soon even casual
onlookers know Kevin from Micah from Bobby.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's exciting,'' Niki says. ``The lifestyle, the screams,
people knowing your name. Like when I went to the CD release party,
I had on this VIP pass and I felt like `Oh my gosh, I feel so
important!'''
</P>
<P>
   Niki's mom, 41-year-old Debbie Sexton, believes it's all
innocent fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are nice people. We show up at everything,'' she says.
``Right now, the guys are having as much fun as the girls. ... I
can remember when the Beatles came, it was your dream to just say
`I met them.' This is like, `I was there. I know them.'''
</P>
<P>
   Starr's strategy comes with perks and bonuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``These girls can't control themselves because we make them feel
like VIPs,'' he says. ``We give them the game plan, fill them up
with energy and send them on their way. It's not unlike that
motivational speaker, what's his name ... Tony Robbins. The ones
who do the best (i.e. high record sales in their neighborhoods) get
limo rides, dinner with their favorite guy, a concert in their
living room.''
</P>
<P>
   In the months leading up to this video shoot, some of the fans
have even become friends with the guys, hanging out with them at
Steak &AMP; Shake, riding the water slides at Whitewater, attending
youth nights at Cowboy's. But the girls, their parents and Starr
insist the relationships stay strictly platonic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a date,'' Rachel says. ``It's like a hangout.''
</P>
<P>
   Paula Youngblood of Stone Mountain, whose daughter Kimberly, 20,
appears as a fan in the video, said she had her doubts when Starr
approached her daughter at a local teen club.
</P>
<P>
   ``I work at a law firm, and I checked him out, believe me,'' she
says. ``Anytime a 40-something-year-old man is looking at my
daughter, he's going to be checked out by me. I made him take me to
lunch at Piccadilly, and we discussed things.''
</P>
<P>
   With Starr as songwriter on all 10 tracks, 6 Piece's first
album, ``Phase I,'' arrived in stores last week. The single, ``My
First, My Last,'' was picked up in Atlanta by new Top 40 station
95.5 The Beat. The video is being rushed into post-production, then
will be distributed to music channels such as the Box, an
all-request cable channel that has become a tryout forum for new
acts before they make it to MTV. That's when the Promote Team will
be put into action to start calling the 1-900 phone number over and
over again to ask that it be played.
</P>
<P>
   What will it take for 6 Piece to succeed? They seem set to be
the Next Big Thing for teen girls, at least for awhile.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they'll make it. It's a totally different type of
sound,'' says Mike Abrams, program director of 95.5 The Beat, who
thinks Starr's latest creation sound-- ``more R&AMP;B'' than Backstreet
Boys. ``They have a great stage show. They are hungry and
ambitious. Maurice Starr is still a big name in this industry, and
that will open doors.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting the right exposure
</P>
<P>
   Even with Starr's track record and clout _ beyond vocal coaches
and choreographers, Kevin says the business plan mentions an
appearance on ``Oprah Winfrey'' in the near future and someday, a
show at Philips Arena _ it seems a daunting challenge in a pop
music market teeming with cloned boy bands. In addition to the two
big moneymakers, Backstreet Boys and 'N Sync, there's Boyzone, 98
Degrees, LFO, C-Note, 5IVE and Youngstown. There's even a parody of
the genre, a fictitious group called 2+gether, now making the
rounds on MTV's ``Total Request Live.'' And ABC is creating a
reality-based show (``Making the Band'') about the birth of a boy
band, which will air Friday nights.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's always room for another boy band,'' says Ellen
Jurcsak, editor of 16 Magazine. ``Exposure is a big part of it,
getting them out there where girls can see them and listen to their
music and get to know them a little bit. With that comes the desire
to know everything about them, to meet them, collect posters,
pinups. A lot of it has to do with luck.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Starr would have to concede that birthing a boy band can be
problematic, especially if the group makes it big. His own
creations, New Edition and New Kids on the Block, went on to seek
solo careers. Two of today's hottest boy groups, Backstreet Boys
and 'N Sync, have both sued their creator _ Orlando mogul Lou
Pearlman _ for bigger shares of the pot and jumped ship to a
different set of handlers.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin says he believes he made the right decision to put art
college on hold for awhile to give 6 Piece a shot. He says he is
getting used to ``being a character onstage,'' and that working a
crowd in live performance ``is an adrenaline rush, like a feeling
I've never had before.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fans are looking for a person who can touch them and make them
excited,'' he says. ``They want to see six good-looking guys
onstage who are pretending to sing just to them.''

 &HT;    The $13.4 million question: Where's Rudolph?
 &HT;    By Marlon Manuel
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Where's bombing suspect Eric Robert Rudolph? No one
seems to know. But not finding him has cost millions in tax
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The 26-month search for the suspect in a 1998 Birmingham, Ala.,
abortion clinic bombing and three earlier Atlanta blasts has cost
at least $13.4 million in state and federal resources, according to
estimates requested by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Rudolph's pseudo-celebrity status once spawned T-shirts, bumper
stickers, cabin rentals and tall tales in the picturesque mountains
of western North Carolina. ``Rudolph eats here,'' one restaurant
marquee read.
</P>
<P>
   His Appalachian disappearing act has created a mountain of
bills, for everything from salaries to helicopter flights to long
underwear. His elusiveness also has left a trail of frustration.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we knew where Mr. Rudolph was, we'd put handcuffs on him,''
said Jack Killorin, agent in charge of the federal Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms in Atlanta. ``There's ample evidence
out there that we just don't know where Mr. Rudolph is.''
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of agencies _ including several in Georgia _ have looked
for the 33-year-old former carpenter.
</P>
<P>
   As for the public expense revealed so far, nearly one-third _
$4.6 million _ exceeds normal operating costs and has been
triggered by the search. The remaining cost, mostly salaries and
benefits, would have been paid to agents even without the search.
</P>
<P>
   However, the complete tracking cost by multiple agencies may be
millions higher.
</P>
<P>
   Neither FBI headquarters in Washington nor the FBI office in
Atlanta has released an estimate on the Rudolph search.
</P>
<P>
   One clue as to the magnitude of the FBI's potential spending
might be gleaned from the cost of a 1996 standoff with the Montana
Freemen at a remote location near Billings, Mont.
</P>
<P>
   During that 81-day operation, the FBI spent $7.5 million,
according to the General Accounting Office. The Rudolph search has
eclipsed 776 days.
</P>
<P>
   Led by the FBI, the multiagency Southeast Bomb Task Force has
hunkered down for two years in Andrews, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   FBI expenditures likely will account for most of the money spent
on the nationwide manhunt.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, FBI Director Louis J. Freeh testified before the
House Appropriations Subcommittee's panel on funding the Commerce,
Justice and State Departments about the bureau's spending plan for
the coming year. Rep. Charles Taylor (R-N.C.), whose district
includes the primary search area, questioned Freeh about the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``With respect to total expenditures, I'd have to come back with
a more exact number,'' Freeh said. ``Clearly, with the salaries and
the infrastructure, we're talking about several millions of dollars
just on the FBI's part.''
</P>
<P>
   Freeh plans to visit with investigators next week to evaluate
whether additional agents are needed and to talk with local law
enforcement officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our theory has been, one, that he is there,'' the director
said. ``Secondly, the pressure of being pursued, we believe, has
contributed to him not doing . . . what the FBI suspects he has
done in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Task force leaders vow to search for Rudolph until he's captured
or confirmed dead. The last verified sighting of the fugitive came
in July 1998 in the North Carolina mountains.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI has promised to make a millionaire out of anyone who
gives information that leads to Rudolph's arrest. But that would be
hard to do if he's dead, and the outgoing head of the ATF in
Washington said in December he thinks that is what's happened.
</P>
<P>
   That set Nantahala resident John Wagner to wondering about how
to collect the loot: ``They tell me, 'Just bring in his teeth.'''
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, millions of tax dollars have been spent to hunt
Rudolph.
</P>
<P>
   The GBI and Georgia Department of Corrections together have
contributed nearly 40 cents for every dollar so far acknowledged in
the nationwide manhunt. Overtime pay accounts for $1.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Work in a criminal case, it's going to cost money to do
that,'' said Vernon Keenan, GBI assistant director. ``It's a matter
of prioritizing your cases, and this certainly was a priority
case.''
</P>
<P>
   The largest reported share of the growing price tag belongs to
the ATF. In response to a request for public records, ATF
headquarters in Washington reported spending about $8 million
looking for Rudolph _ more than half the total cost revealed thus
far.
</P>
<P>
   The manhunt forced the ATF to spend $3 million it otherwise
might not have spent. The estimate covers activity from Jan. 29,
1998 _ the date of the fatal bombing at a Birmingham abortion
clinic _ through Oct. 1, 1999, the end of last fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not unreasonable,'' said Killorin, ATF chief in
Atlanta, a major contributor to the task force. ``We've had a large
number of people up there. And this search is not just in the
Nantahala Forest. We get leads from all over the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's one thing I don't think people understand. I didn't
understand it at first. ... It was kind of like searching and
you're told you're looking for a point somewhere in the Atlantic
Ocean. It's a raw, natural wilderness.''
</P>
<P>
   After a nail bomb detonated at the New Woman All Women Health
Care Clinic in Birmingham and killed an off-duty police officer
providing security, agents descended on the Nantahala region of
North Carolina where Rudolph grew up. Officials characterized
Rudolph as a survivalist and theorized the former carpenter was
hiding in the dense mountain woods. Federal officials later charged
Rudolph with the Birmingham blast as well as three prior Atlanta
bombings: the deadly explosion at Centennial Olympic Park during
the Atlanta Games on July 27, 1996, and the 1997 blasts at an
abortion clinic and a gay and lesbian nightclub.
</P>
<P>
   The search estimate does not include investigative work done on
the Atlanta bombings, which occurred before Rudolph was identified
as a suspect. It also omits the costs incurred by local agencies,
like police departments in Atlanta, Birmingham, Andrews and Murphy,
N.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was quite a bit of extra time,'' said Jack Thompson, former
sheriff in Murphy. ``I think the community would think it's a waste
of money, just the number of people and the work. Of course, it
helped the economy, too, especially in the winter.''
</P>
<P>
   The search created a cottage industry along the winding two-lane
roads of western North Carolina, especially after the sighting in
July 1998. Entrepreneurs sold bumper stickers. Agents rented
cabins. Reporters jammed hotels. Restaurants that never before had
lines began turning away frustrated locals.
</P>
<P>
   So it's hardly a surprise to anyone in Nantahala that the search
for Rudolph runs into the millions.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've expected it,'' said Bill Roper, who owns a boot store
on the edge of the Nantahala Gorge, an area known for whitewater
rafting and hiking.
</P>
<P>
   But no one's talking about Rudolph much anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dear God,'' Roper said. ``We had this thing for 24 hours a
day, 7 days a week. People would ask, `Do you know how much this is
costing?' But now, people just roll their eyes. After so long,
everything goes away.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the searchers. Some investigators remain in Andrews.
However, few, if any, tactical searchers are there. Neither the GBI
nor the Georgia Department of Corrections still has people
stationed in North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``You do reach a point where it's no longer appropriate to keep
putting work into a case when the work is not there,'' said the
GBI's Keenan.
</P>
<P>
   With most of the searchers gone, much of the work currently
belongs to accountants. The GBI and the state corrections
department still are waiting for FBI reimbursements of expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Together, the GBI and state corrections department have spent
$5.3 million looking for Rudolph. The corrections department
estimates spending more than $4.3 million assisting the task force
from July 1998 through Dec. 31. Prison guards joined the task force
after federal agents reached an agreement with then-commissioner
Wayne Garner.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after newly elected Gov. Roy Barnes replaced Garner with
Jim Wetherington in April 1999, the new commissioner became
concerned that the reduction of prison guards in state facilities
might create a safety hazard.
</P>
<P>
   The corrections department ended its Task Force commitment New
Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had concerns about where our money was being spent,'' said
Mike Light, Wetherington's executive assistant. ``We had to weigh
our participation against all other concerns we had.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 350 members of the department's tactical squads _
teams trained to handle prison riots _ helped the task force. They
provided security for the Andrews command post and tried tracking
Rudolph with their highly regarded bloodhound teams.
</P>
<P>
   Under agreements reached with the FBI, the state Corrections
Department has requested $1.5 million in federal reimbursements.
Nearly $982,000 is under review and remains unpaid by the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Corrections has asked for FBI reimbursements including: _
$893,000 for overtime, including $8,773 a year in overtime for each
officer who worked on the search full-time.
</P>
<P>
   _ $324,000 for food, clothing, lodging and real estate rental.
</P>
<P>
   _ $25,000 for helicopter flights.
</P>
<P>
   Before the GBI withdrew from Andrews, the bureau had 25 agents
assigned to various roles, including supervisors, analysts,
investigators, print experts and bomb squad members.
</P>
<P>
   The GBI estimates its Rudolph-related expenses at $971,000 from
January 1998 to January 2000, when just four investigators remained
on the case.
</P>
<P>
   Absent from the GBI breakdown are food and lodging
reimbursements that agents filed with the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Former task force chief Woody Enderson, who retired from the FBI
last year before leaving for a private security firm in Charlotte,
declined several times to estimate the cost of the search.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have some idea but it would be inappropriate for me to
discuss what the cost is,'' Enderson said July 20 in his last
Andrews news conference. ``That would be an appropriate question,
but not to me, because I'm an operational guy, and I'm out here to
locate and apprehend Eric Rudolph. I don't do the budget, I don't
take part in budget considerations.''
</P>
<P>
   Agents contend the fugitive they're hunting would have bombed
again if not for their intervention. Consistently at press
briefings in Andrews, task force leaders called Rudolph a coward,
not the folklore hero he's become in some circles.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you get for your money?'' asked the ATF's Killorin.
``With the search, he's been identified and charged. What's left is
for him to be apprehended. We believe our pressure on him has
helped protect against other incidents.''

DOW RISES ALMOST 500 POINTS AS INVESTORS GO ON BUYING SPREE

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Investors bought stocks furiously on Thursday,
sending the Dow Jones industrial average up nearly 500 points in
its biggest one-day point gain since October 1987. Broader indexes
also rose sharply as investors _ at least for the day _ put aside
fears that the Federal Reserve will aggressively raise interest
rates and slow the economy to a crawl.
</P>
<P>
   When trading began, buyers flocked to the old economy companies
that make up the bulk of the stock market but that have languished
much of this year. Stocks of financial companies such as J.P.
Morgan performed especially well, as did shares of airlines and
other companies whose profits will probably be strong if the U.S.
economy stays healthy.
</P>
<P>
   But by mid-afternoon, the buying had spread to technology and
Internet companies, new economy stocks that had already posted
strong gains this year. By the end of the day, all segments of the
market were sharply higher, with the Dow Jones industrials rising
499 points, or nearly 5 percent, to 10,631.
</P>
<P>
   The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index ended three days of
sharp losses with a gain of nearly 3 percent. Apparently afraid
that they would miss out on gains, investors scurried to join the
rally, setting a record for trading on the New York Stock Exchange,
with 1.5 billion shares changing hands.
</P>
<P>
   By any standard, the gains were outsized. Venerable old economy
companies like American Express and General Motors saw their stocks
dance like new technology butterflies, with American Express
gaining $10.25, to $143.125, and GM $4.9375, to $83.75.
</P>
<P>
   The performance of the broader Standard and Poor's 500 index was
equally giddy. The S&AMP;P 500, which represents about 70 percent of
the value of all U.S. stocks, rose 66 points, or 4.8 percent, to
1458. While the point gain was the biggest for the Dow in over a
decade, at 4.9 percent it was the biggest in percentage terms only
since September 1998. Combined with Wednesday's 3.3 percent
increase, Thursday's gain amounted to the best two-day performance
for the index since its rally after the crash of October 1987.
</P>
<P>
   ``A calm is settling in over the market on interest rates,''
said James Weiss, deputy chief investment officer of State Street
Research, which manages $55 billion. ``The market at the moment
seems to be comfortable that the Fed is going to raise interest
rates a couple of times but not more than that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve has raised short-term interest rates four
times since June in an effort to slow the booming economy, and Fed
Chairman Alan Greenspan has said he is worried about the potential
for inflation to accelerate. Along with higher oil prices, the
higher interest rates appear to have slowed the economy slightly,
said Jeffrey Applegate, chief investment strategist for Lehman
Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   Applegate, a longtime bull, said a moderate economic slowdown is
good news for stocks, because it means that over the next few
months, the Federal Reserve will not have to raise rates as much as
investors previously expected. So investors can begin to look well
past the expected quarter-point increase by the Fed policy makers
next week to another period of steady interest rates and strong
corporate profits. That combination almost always makes for higher
stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``If, in fact, the Fed can go on hold, because there's not a
reason to do a lot of tightening, that's good for the markets,''
Applegate said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Greenspan has expressed concern that the meteoric rise in
technology stocks is encouraging spending by consumers who feel
increasingly wealthy on paper. Their spending could in turn fuel
inflation. To lessen that risk, Greenspan has said he would like
stock prices to grow more slowly, a warning heeded by technology
investors in the previous three days but disregarded on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street traders, who were even more swamped than usual on
Thursday, said buy orders seemed to come from all directions. While
investors' appetite for stock mutual funds has abated from its
record highs in February, when it averaged $10 billion per week, it
remains strong, according AMG Data Services of Arcata, Calif. AMG,
which tracks investment in mutual funds, said $5 billion went into
stock funds in the week ended Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The day began rather quietly. A few minutes after the opening
bell on the New York Stock Exchange, the Dow was up fewer than 100
points. The Nasdaq composite, which has been extremely volatile
lately and was down more than 9 percent the previous three days,
opened up, but fell sharply toward midday. Shortly after 11 a.m.,
it was down more than 100 points.
</P>
<P>
   As the day progressed, the Dow rocketed higher, and by
mid-afternoon, it had pulled the Nasdaq into positive territory.
From there, old economy and new economy stocks sprinted, closing
the day near their highs.

COMMENTARY: THE PRODIGAL SENATOR RETURNS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By GAIL COLLINS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   John McCain arrives home from his vacation in Bora-Bora this
weekend. On Monday he returns to the Senate, and everybody is dying
to see how he is greeted. The Republican leaders are eager to
demonstrate they are uniters, not dividers, good-natured guys who
don't at all mind having been constantly referred to as the Forces
of Darkness by one of their own members.
</P>
<P>
   The senator is said to be hoping for something low-key. ``He
never was much for senatorial courtesy anyway,'' noted an aide.
</P>
<P>
   People, you should jump into this discussion. True, McCain
failed in his mission to reform the campaign finance laws, so
voters still don't have quite as much pull in Washington as, say,
the pharmaceutical industry. Still, choose one of the following:
</P>
<P>
   John McCain should return to the Senate . . .
</P>
<P>
   A) Wrapped in a rug, like Cleopatra, which when unrolled will
deposit him at Trent Lott's feet.
</P>
<P>
   B) For a great welcome-home fiesta, during which Republican
senators will take turns swinging at a giant pinata filled with
soft money and shaped like McCain's head.
</P>
<P>
   C) Under armed guard.
</P>
<P>
   The wounds of the primary campaign have, um, not exactly healed.
The McCain campaign reports that many, many emissaries have been
attempting to achieve rapprochement on behalf of the Bush camp,
possibly with an eye to delivering the senator the way Big Pussy
Bompensiero delivered the guy who tried to rub out Tony Soprano's
favored underling.
</P>
<P>
   There had been some signs during the primaries that Bush is a
sore loser _ after New Hampshire, according to the McCain camp, he
tried to concede through an aide. But lately it's been looking as
if the Texas governor is not all that charming as a winner either.
He told The New York Times that he regrets nothing, has changed his
mind about nothing, and plans to do nothing in response to all
those weeks of listening to McCain talk about reform. He did,
however, genially give his former opponent credit for having
``forced me to play to my strength better.''
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing so dispiriting, really, as presidential
candidates who absolutely insist on sticking to stereotype. But
here we have George W., back from his first two months of
hand-to-hand combat on a national stage, and you ask him what he's
learned, and he stares at the ground and moves some dirt with his
foot and mutters, ``Nuttin'.''
</P>
<P>
   The boy never did take to schooling.
</P>
<P>
   But on the other hand, gosh, did Al Gore ever learn stuff. He
took notes! Which he has already, of course, transcribed on his
Thinkpad 600 and filed in color-coordinated folders. (All
references to Bush tax proposals can be found under R for
``risky.'') Gore hardly ever gives a speech now without reverently
quoting John McCain. Some people are wondering whether the
vacationing senator has heard he's become the vice president's new
role model.
</P>
<P>
   ``That'd be hard to miss even in Bora-Bora,'' said a McCain
aide.
</P>
<P>
   The post-primary campaign is getting a little too intense for
this stage of the game, especially after Bush made those soothing
comments about the public's right to hibernate from politics for a
while. Cynics said he was actually only trying to avoid Gore's
challenge to engage in immediate wall-to-wall debates. But it's
hard to believe that a would-be Reaganite like Bush would joke
about something as important as naps.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, a lot of ordinary citizens have taken Bush at his
word and gone home to put their heads down. On Tuesday in Al Gore's
hometown, the local paper's headline was ``STATE PRIMARY LARGELY
INSIGNIFICANT.'' There were some complaints that this was not a
very good way to drum up voter turnout.
</P>
<P>
   The schoolchildren, however, dutifully showed up to watch the
vice president vote for himself. Afterward Gore invited them to ask
questions, and before you knew it he was telling the little kids
about his role in reinventing government, the Telecommunications
Reform Act, bridging the Digital Divide and shoring up Social
Security. They ran out of questions in a remarkably short time.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president needs coaching on his Talks to Youth. Perhaps
McCain could give him some tips he picked up at the MTV awards.

 &HT;    S.C. lawmakers consider two-flag proposal
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ South Carolina legislators are talking about flying
Confederate and Union battle flags together on the Statehouse
grounds, one in a flurry of possible compromises rising from
pressure to end feuding over the Rebel flag.
</P>
<P>
   Charleston Mayor Joseph Riley said Thursday he is organizing
next month's five-day march from Charleston to Columbia ``to put
pressure on the Legislature to act, and to act now'' to move the
flag, the last to fly atop a state capitol.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are halfway through the legislative session,'' Riley said.
``I think there is a real frustration among the people of our state
that this matter was not dealt with, if not last year, certainly
during the first week of the session.''
</P>
<P>
   Charleston's longtime Democratic mayor, a vocal critic of the
flag's prominent display at the capitol, said he will carry a South
Carolina flag during the march. It will start April 2 and end April
6, when Riley will present the flag to Gov. Jim Hodges, also a
Democrat, at the Statehouse.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile Thursday, flag supporters gathered in the Statehouse
lobby to denounce the South Carolina Chamber of Commerce for
pushing for removal of the banner, but they did not call for a
counter-boycott of chamber businesses, as had been threatened.
However, Heritage Coalition Executive Director Chris Sullivan did
say flag supporters should ``think twice'' about patronizing them.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Statehouse rallies by both flag supporters and
opponents drew thousands of people, as the NAACP launched a
national tourism boycott of South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Some business leaders have said the boycott is, indeed, hurting
commerce. The Columbia Metropolitan Convention and Visitors Bureau
released a survey Wednesday of seven large hotels and conference
centers indicating that the dispute has led to the cancellation of
54 large meetings and the loss of 24,100 visitors since it was
announced last July.
</P>
<P>
   Flag supporters argue that the effects of the boycott are
grossly overstated. Elijah Coleman of Southern Internet News
Publication, for instance, points to estimates that the Republican
primary in February brought $7 million in revenue into the state,
and that journalists covering the event brought another $4 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Confederate flag has flown over the capitol dome since 1962,
when the Legislature raised it as part of a Civil War centennial.
Critics say it was also hoisted in defiance of desegregation, a
charge that has placed the flag at the center of a national debate
over whether Confederate symbols represent respect for the war
dead, or hatred rooted in slavery.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to end the discord that he says threatens to tear apart
South Carolina, Hodges has proposed removing the flag from the
capitol and placing a similar Confederate banner at a Statehouse
grounds monument honoring Confederate Gen. Wade Hampton.
</P>
<P>
   But Confederate heritage groups rejected the proposal, with some
leaders saying the location is not prominent enough. The NAACP,
meanwhile, rejected the location as too prominent for a flag they
believe belongs in a museum.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, legislators have begun talking privately about
the idea of flying the Confederate flag and the Union battle flag
together at the Confederate soldiers' monument on the Statehouse
grounds.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Glenn McConnell, a Charleston Republican, has
insisted that the Rebel banner be placed at the soldiers' monument,
if it is moved. He said Thursday he ``can live with the two-flag
proposal.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the proposal ``has sparked interest on both sides. ...
The flags would salute the South Carolinians who marched to the
Confederate drum and those who marched to the Union drum.''
</P>
<P>
   McConnell, a Civil War buff and re-enactor, said two
predominantly black South Carolina regiments fighting for the Union
carried a flag that ``looks like the United States flag.''
</P>
<P>
   A replica of that flag would be appropriate to fly with the
Confederate banner, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Also generating interest among legislators, McConnell said, is a
new proposal to encase an original Confederate flag and a flag pole
in ``an airtight glass box'' at the Confederate soldiers' monument.
</P>
<P>
   The approximately 5-by-8-foot flag would hang from a 12- to
15-foot-tall flag pole, McConnell said. Glass would enclose it from
the ground to the top of the pole.
</P>
<P>
   Saying ``I've got to think it through,'' McConnell said, at
first glance, the proposal would satisfy heritage groups' demand
that the flag fly at the soliders' monument, while satisfying its
critics who insist the banner belongs in a museum.
</P>
<P>
   But hinting at likely opposition to these proposals, Mayor Riley
said putting the Confederate flag at the soldiers' monument gives
the Civil War too prominent a place in South Carolina's history.
The monument rises from the Statehouse grounds at Main and Gervasis
streets, a busy intersection.
</P>
<P>
   ``To take the event and say it is the heritage of the state and
give it a markedly prominent place at our state capitol is wrong,''
Riley said. ``I do not think that will fly.''

   RUSSIA: 6 CHARGED IN BLASTS
</P>
<P>
   Intelligence officials said six suspects had been charged with
the bombings in Moscow and other cities that killed nearly 300
people. Five were charged in absentia; the sixth is in prison.
Officials said the explosives were traced to Chechnya. Critics say
there is no proof Chechens were involved, and some say elements of
the intelligence services may have organized the blasts as a
pretext for the Chechnya military campaign.

   A proposal that it call on Italy to lift a ban on males of the

Minister Jean Chretien did not abuse his power when he asked Queen
Elizabeth II not to award a life peerage to Conrad Black, owner of
57 daily newspapers in Canada. The judge ruled, however, that Black
can proceed with a damage suit against the government for public
embarrassment he says he suffered after obtaining British

   CLEVELAND _ Sometimes, the wrong team wins.
</P>
<P>
   Kentucky, a No. 5 seed, was supposed to win and did. St.
Bonaventure, the No. 12 seed, was supposed to lose.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like we should be playing Saturday,'' said Bonnies
senior guard David Messiah Capers. ``The crowd wanted us to win
that game.''
</P>
<P>
   So did most of America.
</P>
<P>
   The fifth-seeded Wildcats needed two overtimes plus every bit of
their talent and blue-blood reputation to advance in the NCAA
Tournament. Kentucky (23-9) will play in the second round for the
ninth consecutive year because of Thursday's 85-80 first-round
victory over St. Bonaventure (22-10), an NCAA entrant for the first
time since 1978.
</P>
<P>
   St. Bonaventure _ the patron saint of near upsets. In the first
game played in this year's NCAA Tournament, with CBS sending the
game to most of the country, the Bonnies nearly produced the first
surprise story.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew it would be a great game because it was a 5-12 game
and everybody was looking for an upset,'' said Kentucky sophomore
forward Tayshaun Prince, who helped make it great. His 3-pointer at
7.1 seconds sent the game into overtime. Prince finished with a
career-high 28 and at one point scored 15 of his team's 20 points.
</P>
<P>
   Prince was Kentucky's hero. Messiah Capers was ... what? The
anti-hero? The near-hero? Heroes are supposed to play for winners.
</P>
<P>
   This game went two overtimes because of a why-did-he-do-that
foul on Kentucky's Marvin Stone. With four-tenths of a second
remaining, Messiah Capers went to the line, the Bonnies trailing
76-73.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a good free-throw shooter, I'm not Shaquille O'Neal,'' he
said. ``I just got off to a bad start this season.'' The stat sheet
has Messiah Capers as a 55.6 percent foul shooter. In six of his
past eight games, he did not have an attempt.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the situation everybody dreams about,'' St. Bonaventure
senior guard Tim Winn said. ``I was standing there thinking, `I've
had this dream and I was at the line.' But I was glad it was him
instead of me.''
</P>
<P>
   Messiah Capers swished the first. Kentucky, timeout. He swished
the second. Kentucky, timeout. He swished the third. ``Those
timeouts seemed kinda long,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That's as many free throws as Messiah Capers had made in his
past eight games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't thinking about the past, I was looking at right
then,'' he said. ``Percentages go out the window. There was no
doubt in my mind, it was just all confidence. I didn't want to wind
up on ESPN because I missed the game-tying free throw.''
</P>
<P>
   The teams traded 23-5 runs and shooting droughts. Kentucky's
came in the first half. The Wildcats led 44-31 with 15:55
remaining. Then, the Bonnies self-ignited, hitting four of five
3-pointers to produce a 23-5 game-changing spurt. For the last 18
minutes, the biggest lead for either team was five.
</P>
<P>
   Kentucky's biggest basket in the second overtime came with 11.6
seconds remaining. Freshman Keith Bogans gathered a loose ball and
laid it in for an 83-80 lead. Winn's last-chance 3-pointer kicked
in, then out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to play our hearts out,'' said Prince, who could tread
water in a test tube.
</P>
<P>
   St. Bonaventure had a handful of mighta-been, shoulda-been
moments. After taking a 52-48 lead, Caswell Cyrus was called for a
technical for hanging on the rim. Kentucky made one of two free
throws. Moments later, up 54-49, the Bonnies frittered away three
good-for-nothing possessions.
</P>
<P>
   With 1:23 remaining, senior guard Winn failed to convert a
three-point play opportunity. Then, with the chance to win the game
in regulation, he couldn't convert a contested layup. In the first
overtime, J.R. Bremer made the first two, but missed the third
after being fouled on a 3-point try.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great way to start of the NCAA Tournament,'' St.
Bonaventure coach Jim Baron said. ``We did everything we possibly
could.''
</P>
<P>
   Except win.

 &HT;    Chile's president comes full circle
 &HT;    By Don Melvin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ One Sunday evening in September 1973, Ford Foundation
official Peter Bell and his wife, Karen, sat down to dinner at a
restaurant in Santiago, Chile, with their friends Ricardo and Luisa
Lagos.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone sensed that a political coup was coming. They could
feel it. Bell and Lagos, an educator and university official,
talked about it. Salvador Allende, a socialist elected in 1970 with
a third of the vote, had overplayed his hand and abandoned the
center.
</P>
<P>
   But none of the people at that dinner, Bell said, thought the
coup would come as soon or be as virulent as turned out to be the
case.
</P>
<P>
   And there was something else they didn't foresee, Bell said.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of us would have believed in our wildest dreams that 27
years later, Ricardo would be democratically elected as the
president of Chile,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But it happened. Last weekend, Bell, now the president of CARE,
the Atlanta-based relief and development organization, traveled
with his wife to Chile as Lagos' special guests to celebrate his
inauguration.
</P>
<P>
   Just a day and a half after that Sunday dinner _ early on
Tuesday morning, Sept. 11, 1973 _ a junta led by Gen. Augusto
Pinochet ousted Allende's government. Allende was killed.
</P>
<P>
   During Pinochet's 17 years in power more than 3,000 people were
killed or ``disappeared'' in a campaign against the country's
leftists. Fear was in the air. Bell, who lived in Chile from
1970-74, found himself on a list of suspicious people. He returned
home one day to find his wife cradling their infant son and saying
that a neighbor _ a person the Bells suspected of being a
right-wing vigilante _ had dropped by to say that Bell should be
executed.
</P>
<P>
   Now, things have come full circle. Pinochet has returned to
Chile, free from international prosecution but discredited and,
said Bell, irrelevant to Chilean politics. And Lagos, a socialist,
was sworn in Saturday as president.
</P>
<P>
   Bell said he thinks Lagos has what it takes to govern well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew him as a very competent manager who is also politically
adept,'' Bell said. Furthermore, Bell said, Lagos is determined to
hold the country together and avoid the polarization of past eras.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have every reason to believe that he will be a very
successful president of all Chileans,'' Bell said.

FOR RUSSIA'S REGIONAL PRESS, MORE FREEDOM OR NEW POLITICAL
ALLEGIANCE? 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARTYOM, Russia _ The most autocratic governor on Russia's
Pacific Rim received a particularly warm birthday greeting in
February: heads of the regional press gathered to give him a cake
in the shape of his fief and offered up a specially composed ditty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dear Volodya, what a friend, your opposition is at the end,''
the editors congratulated Yevgeny Nazdratenko, the governor of the
Primorye, or Maritime, region.
</P>
<P>
   These days, that kind of press praise for the men who rule
Russia's regions is hardly unique. From Pskov on Russia's western
border to here, on its eastern frontier, Russia's regional
newspapers are increasingly under the thumb of local authorities.
</P>
<P>
   This has not escaped the attention of Acting President Vladimir
Putin, a passionate advocate of building a strong federal state in
a Russia whose vast and distant lands have slipped from the
near-ironclad authority that Moscow enjoyed in Soviet times.
</P>
<P>
   One of Putin's first decrees as acting president authorizes
federal subsidies to 2,500 local newspapers, including 19
provincial newspapers here in Primorye. More than $6 million in
subsidies are planned for this year.
</P>
<P>
   The president's men insist he is striking a blow for press
freedom. But critics say the unspoken agenda is to shift the
allegiance of the regional press from the regional overlords to
Putin, the overwhelming favorite to win the March 26 presidential
election.
</P>
<P>
   In Artyom, a downtrodden town with sporadic heat and no hot
water, a top editor of Vybor, a local weekly, is not troubled by
the moral debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're backing Putin,'' said Lyubov Vozian, the deputy editor
of the cash-poor paper, cheerfully. ``We want the money.''
</P>
<P>
   With its smattering of small-town news, paid political ads and
television listings, Vybor could never be mistaken for one of the
nation's leading newspapers. A six-month subscription to the
eight-page weekly costs 36 rubles (about $1.25).
</P>
<P>
   But provincial newspapers like this have become increasingly
important because they are the only publications that millions of
Russians read.
</P>
<P>
   Major national newspapers like Izvestia may influence the
chattering classes in Moscow, seven times zones west of Artyom.
Outside Moscow, many Russians consider such papers an unnecessary
luxury.
</P>
<P>
   Izvestia, for example, had a circulation of more than 6 million
when it was a propaganda organ for the Soviet state. These days,
Izvestia's circulation is 262,000. Fewer than 2,000 of those copies
are sold here in Primorye.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten years ago, most families read two, three or four
newspapers,'' said Vladimir G. Ostrovsky, the deputy editor of
Vladivostok, the region's most established local newspaper. ``Most
families now read one newspaper at most. It has to be cheap and it
has to have the television listings.''
</P>
<P>
   With major Moscow-based advertisers reluctant to include the
poorer provinces in their publicity campaigns, and with publication
costs rising steadily, the regional press has become increasingly
dependent on the good will and financial backing of local
politicians. These patrons expect a high degree of political
loyalty in return.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the Primorye region has been no easy place to
practice journalism. After a brief moment of freedom following the
collapse of the Soviet Union, Nazdratenko came to power in 1992.
Like many other regional leaders who slipped from the Kremlin's
grasp and reached various accommodations with Moscow in exchange
for local power, he turned the region into his political fief.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are really only two political parties here: the governor
and the opposition,'' said Marina Loboda, a Vladivostok-based
reporter for Moskovsky Komsomolets, the national tabloid. ``All the
other political parties live in Moscow.''
</P>
<P>
   Editors say the authorities have several ways to keep the press
in line. They can encourage Russian and foreign companies to
advertise in their favored newspapers. They can evict news
organizations from government-owned buildings or pressure private
landlords to evict troublesome news bureaus. They can file lawsuit
after lawsuit to keep the editors in court or force them to pay
fines.
</P>
<P>
   In Vladivostok, the region's main printing press is owned by the
federal government, but Nazdratenko has been lobbying hard to gain
control. Local editors say that the governor already has
considerable influence at the plant.
</P>
<P>
   ``According to government regulations, we have to have a month's
reserve of paper on hand,'' Ostrovsky said. ``But nobody can afford
to do that. So it is a lever that can be used at any time.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In extreme cases, rebellious editors or broadcasters have been
threatened or roughed up, although aides to Nazdratenko deny that
they had anything to do with such attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the press, however, needs no coercion, as Nazdratenko's
birthday bash made plain.
</P>
<P>
   After presenting the congratulatory ditty, the journalists gave
him small gifts, including a dartboard with a picture of Anatoly
Chubais, the self-styled reformer and one of the governor's
political nemeses.
</P>
<P>
   The private event was filmed by the governor's television
station, OTV PRIM, as a memento of the occasion, but a tape was
leaked to NTV, Russia's only independent television network. ``The
press really demonstrated what it has become,'' said Andrei
Kalachinsky, who runs the Vladivostok office of the National Press
Institute, a nongovernmental group that is trying to encourage a
free press. ``They came and bowed to the feet of the governor.''
</P>
<P>
   Sergei Manin, an executive at Artyom's municipal television
station, said the journalists' sentiments were heartfelt. ``The
media expressed its feelings quite sincerely,'' Manin said. ``And
the guy who leaked the tape was fired.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   As in many other regions across Russia, even those local
journalists less enamored of Nazdratenko are not always
independent. Also lacking resources to publish or broadcast, they
often receive financial support from the governor's political
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow, federal officials say the subservience of the
regional news media is a serious and growing problem. To combat it,
the Russian Press Ministry has already begun to carry out Putin's
decree authorizing subsidies, which officials say are intended to
defray printing and production costs and help the newspapers become
more profitable. The subsidies average $1,500 a month, a
considerable sum for a provincial newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want the newspapers to reflect reality and not the point of
view of a governor,'' said Vladimir V. Grigoryev, the deputy
minister of Russia's press ministry. ``This will help develop a
real media market where newspapers can be bought and sold. It will
probably help us have a freer press.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics assert that if the Russian government wanted a free
press, it would grant new tax breaks to all news media, not
distribute subsidies to a favored group.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an attempt to influence the content of newspapers and
make them more dependent on federal authorities,'' said Andrei G.
Richter, director of the Media Law and Policy Center at Moscow
University.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In Artyom, a city of 114,000 people, the editors of Vybor do not
even dream about total independence. The paper, as they see it,
needs the support of the governor to keep the city's mayor in check
and the backing of the president to counterbalance the governor. It
is a recipe for survival, not autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   But even survival is not easy. Vybor is formally owned by the
local administration, a legacy from Soviet times. The city
administration has not provided any money to the newspaper in more
than a year, and the relationship between the editors and the mayor
is sour.
</P>
<P>
   After Vybor reported about unheated apartment houses and a
paralyzing bus strike, the mayor's office demanded a letter laying
out the evidence. More worrisome, the mayor announced a plan to
take direct control of the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to survive and worried about the mayor's designs, Vybor's
editors turned to Nazdratenko, whose office already provides a
modest subsidy to the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Vybor, in turn, publishes the glowing accounts that the
governor's aides prepare about his activities. To facilitate the
process, the regional government gave Vybor a fax machine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We publish lots of news about the governor's good deeds,''
Vozian, the deputy editor, said brightly. ``He supports us.''
</P>
<P>
   But Vybor would embrace additional allies, particularly in the
Kremlin. The editors were pleased that their weekly is one of 19
provincial newspapers the Russian press ministry is planning to
support in Primorye.
</P>
<P>
   Vozian said that federal officials had promised the newspaper an
initial payment of 60,000 rubles (about $2,100) in exchange for
Vybor's support for Putin's election. The newspaper has not
received the money, but she remains hopeful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, we're supporting Putin,'' she said. ``We want to be
independent.''

SWITCH TO ZONE LIFTS TEXAS OVER INDIANA STATE
</HEADLINE>
 STATE-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE JONES 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ Texas was more than halfway through a tense,
basket-trading first half with Indiana State on Thursday in its
NCAA Tournament opener when coach Rick Barnes decided to shuffle
the deck.
</P>
<P>
   He went with the big lineup of Chris Mihm, Chris Owens and Gabe
Muoneke and shifted the Longhorns from their trademark man-for-man
defense into a 2-3 zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once we did that, our whole body language changed,'' Barnes
said. ``I thought we were a little jumpy to start the game. We went
to the zone and later a triangle-and-two and got a great effort by
the players. The zone slowed (Indiana State) down and helped us
save a little energy and work a little harder on the offensive end.
It kept us alert because we were playing defenses we don't normally
use. I think it surprised them a little.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes' strategy had the desired effect.
</P>
<P>
   Texas trailed 22-19 when he made his move. Seven minutes later,
the fifth-seeded Longhorns held a 39-26 halftime lead and were on
their way to a 77-61 first-round victory over the Sycamores to move
into Saturday's second-round battle in the West Region against No.
4 seed Louisiana State.
</P>
<P>
   ``A well-strategized game,'' Muoneke said. ``You do anything you
can to adjust and try to win. The 2-3 zone was good to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas' front line contributed 48 points, divided equally, and
guard Darren Kelly responded from outside with a trio of 3-point
shots that sparked the late first-half spurt on his way to a
team-high 17 points. Point guard Ivan Wagner passed out a
career-tying 10 assists and contributed seven points.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fantastic to get this win,'' said Mihm, who was limited
to 28 minutes because of foul problems, but still pulled down eight
rebounds. ``To have this team play well like we did and advance is
really special. We played all-around solid basketball at every
position.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas held ISU's leading scorer, Nate Green, to only five points
on eight shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their zone was very tough,'' Green said. ``We had a hard time
getting into it all game. They did a great job on defense.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sycamores did provide a few hairy minutes in the second half
after Texas stretched its lead to 54-37 at 14:42 when Owens laid in
a follow shot. But Mihm drew his third foul on a pushoff and went
to the bench at 11:20 after ISU crept to within 12. The Sycamores
cut the lead to 56-49 following what amounted to a five-point turn
when Muoneke incurred a technical foul for taunting after a jam.
Mihm re-entered, but drew his fourth whistle on an offensive move
and sat down again after only 13 seconds back on the court.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Menser (22 points) nailed a 3-pointer at 10:35 and ISU
was within five (56-51). But at that point, the Longhorns slammed
the door. The Sycamores left the lane with Mihm on the bench and
discovered they couldn't cover Owens one-on-one. He hit two dunks
and a layup over the next four minutes, Muoneke hit a pull-up,
10-foot jumper and then Kelly scored five consecutive points. When
Mihm came back in at 3:38, Texas was up 69-61 and the big sweat was
over.
</P>
<P>
   ``We decided to post up a lot deeper and move the ball around to
get better looks,'' Owens explained. ``That's why we were able to
score inside in the second half.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knows our offense runs through Chris Mihm,'' Kelly
said. ``But Coach always tells me to create, look for my shots and
some for my teammates and that's what I did with Mihm on the
bench.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes was pleased with the Longhorns' performance.

<P>
   ``We played very well against a team I was very impressed
with,'' he said. ``Indiana State would finish in the top six in the
Big 12. That's as good an offense as we've played against all year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hardest game in the tournament is always the first one.
Once that's over, the players settle in and get more comfortable
with the situation. Today was a good win. But we've got to forget
about it and get ready to play another tough game.'' nn

 &HT;    Wolf sinking teeth into Big Apple
 &HT;    By Renee DeGross
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Chuck Wolf is looking at opportunity in the Big Apple
through a wide-angle lens.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Atlanta-based Wolf Camera has gained a foothold in New
York, its founder says it will be only a matter of time before his
company becomes a household name there in film processing, camera
equipment and video services.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf Camera entered New York through its purchase of Westside
Camera in Manhattan in 1998. This month the company agreed to buy
four Alkit Pro Camera stores in Manhattan, and it plans to open two
more locations by May 1.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview this week at his headquarters in Alpharetta, the
57-year-old Wolf said New York offers endless potential for his
company.
</P>
<P>
   ``People line up outside of that (Westside) store,'' Wolf said.
``That's why we're excited about New York.''
</P>
<P>
   The Westside store is the chain's No. 2 in sales volume. In
2,400 square feet, Westside pulls in $5 million annually, behind
the gargantuan Midtown Atlanta store. Wolf did not release sales
figures for the Atlanta site.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say the photofinishing industry has evolved and can be
lucrative because of consumer interest in digital cameras and
imaging.
</P>
<P>
   But it's a capital-intensive proposition to keep up with the
latest digital technology. Wolf said his company invests up to
$200,000 per digital imaging machine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very competitive business that requires substantial
capital per outlet,'' said analyst Pete Enderlin with Ryan Beck &AMP;
Co. in New York. ``But that's an advantage for Wolf because the
company can develop economies of scale with its 800 or so stores.''
</P>
<P>
   Photofinishing worldwide, including digital imaging, is an
estimated $59.2 billion industry, according to the Photo Marketing
Association International of Jackson, Mich. About a third of the
business comes from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will take years before we get the percent of market in New
York that we have in Dallas, Atlanta, Houston and Chicago,'' Wolf
said. But, he added, because New York is so big, ``even if you have
a small share, it's great.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolf admits that the 1998 purchase of 450 CPI/Fox Photo stores
took time to digest. The company had to close 140 locations that
didn't fit the Wolf Camera concept.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we didn't do the Fox thing, we'd be making more money,''
Wolf said. ``It has been a big challenge and has taken two years to
change the employees to the Wolf culture.'' That culture, Wolf says
is service, service and more service.
</P>
<P>
   While Wolf Camera declined to provide financial data on its
business, it ranked No. 11 among the largest privately owned
companies in the 20-county metro Atlanta area, based on 1998
revenue of between $250 million to $499 million, according to a
survey by Arthur Andersen LLP. It was also one of the state's
fastest-growing businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf Camera began operations in 1974 with seven stores in metro
Atlanta and three in Charlotte. Now the company operates in 34
states.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf isn't divulging much about what's next for the business as
he nears 60. ``I still have a passion for the business,'' he said.
``But I am thinking of certain options.'' His son, Alex, is vice
president of real estate.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from New York and other markets, Wolf sees more potential
on the Internet. His two Web sites _ www.wolfcamera.com and
www.wolfxpress.com _ are places where customers can buy camera
equipment and download photographs.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it's the photofinishing business, not the big-ticket digital
cameras or camcorders, that pump up business in the end, Wolf said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't make money on cameras.''

CHARLESTON MAYOR PLANS MARCH AGAINST CONFEDERATE FLAG AT
STATEHOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVID FIRESTONE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   For years, Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr. of Charleston, S.C., has
done everything but beg the South Carolina Legislature to stop
embarrassing the state and lower the Confederate battle flag from
atop the state Capitol in Columbia. On Thursday, frustrated by the
lack of progress on the issue, the mayor announced his boldest
gesture yet: a 120-mile march from Charleston to Columbia in April
to increase the pressure on flag supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Riley, who has been in office since 1975, is a popular figure in
South Carolina, widely credited with revitalizing the city as a
tolerant and gracious tourist attraction. Although the mayor has
never been particularly known for dramatic gestures, he said the
flag's divisive presence called for an updated use of an old civil
rights technique.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been increasingly concerned that the lack of action by
our Legislature is presenting an inaccurate portrayal of our
state,'' Riley said in an interview. ``The broad majority of
citizens in our state want the flag removed _ every religious
group, civic group, business group. Our Legislature is simply out
of step with the people of our state, and I wanted a way to convey
that to the country, and to put pressure on the Legislature to act,
and act now.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor has invited dozens of business and civic leaders to
join him on the five-day trek, which is to begin April 2, and has
said he hopes that hundreds of people will join in. The march will
take place only in daylight hours and will follow U.S. Route 176,
which runs northwest from Charleston and parallels Interstate 26.
Riley said marchers would carry the state flag, which features a
palmetto tree and a crescent moon.
</P>
<P>
   ``People understand that it's the state flag you should fly on
your Capitol,'' he said, ``not the one that represents another
government that's been gone for 135 years.''
</P>
<P>
   The Confederate battle flag has flown from the Statehouse dome
since 1962, when it was raised as a symbol of defiance to the civil
rights movement. Although there have many campaigns to remove the
flag over the years, it became a flashpoint in this year's
presidential campaign after the NAACP, calling the flag a symbol of
slavery and intolerance, declared an economic boycott of South
Carolina until it is removed.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore has called for the flag's removal; his
Republican opponent for the presidency, Gov. George W. Bush of
Texas, has said the matter should be left to the people of South
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Despite increasing pressure from the state's business community
to remove the flag, the matter has been stalled for months by
several hard-line legislators who say they will never agree to move
the flag as long as the boycott is in place. In February, Gov. Jim
Hodges of South Carolina, a Democrat, proposed a compromise that
would move the flag near a statue of Wade Hampton, a Confederate
general from South Carolina, at the rear of the Statehouse. But
flag supporters have blocked the idea, saying the spot is not
sufficiently prominent.
</P>
<P>
   Two state senators on opposite sides of the issue _ Glenn F.
McConnell, a flag supporter who takes part in reenactments of Civil
War battles, and Darrell Jackson, an opponent _ said Wednesday that
they had been quietly negotiating for weeks on a possible
compromise, but had not yet succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   In general, however, the mood in the Statehouse has been
increasingly tense and racially divided, particularly after the
South Carolina House of Representatives recently failed to enact a
state holiday honoring the birthday of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther
King Jr. Republicans attached a provision to the bill declaring the
Confederate battle flag to be a symbol of heritage, not slavery.
When Democrats refused to accept the provision, South Carolina
remained the only state without an official King holiday.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   One leading flag supporter Thursday accused the state's business
leaders, many of whom will be joining Riley on his march, of
selling out the state's traditions because of economic concerns.
Christopher Sullivan, chairman of the South Carolina Heritage
Coalition, which has close ties to many pro-flag legislators, said
businesses were so concerned about the boycott that they had made
the South Carolina Chamber of Commerce ``nothing more than a
political shill for the NAACP.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of its status as a tourist attraction, the Charleston
area has been the hardest-hit region of the state by the boycott. A
number of conventions and sports events have been canceled, along
with a performance by the dance company of Bill T. Jones, a
prominent part of the city's Spoleto arts festival in May and June.
</P>
<P>
   But Riley said economic pressure was the least of his reasons
for organizing the march.
</P>
<P>
   ``The boycott concerns me, but I'm far more worried about the
state's reputation,'' he said. ``We've had good race relations
here. Our governors didn't stand in front of schoolhouse doors and
resist integration.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But this flag issue is creating a different impression,'' he
added, ``and I think it's time that the Legislature finally feels
the heat from the people of South Carolina.''

 &HT;    Market keeps shifting between `old' and `new' economy stocks
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The good news for investors about this week's activity
on Wall Street is that money is staying in the market and not
spilling out into cash, bonds, gold and other alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   It's flowing back and forth between ``old economy'' and ``new
economy'' stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Indeed, (this week's) powerful rally in the long-lagging Dow
Jones industrial average and S&AMP;P 500 apparently attracted funds
that had been sidelined because of worries over the earlier
divergence,'' said Standard &AMP; Poor's analyst Arnold Kaufman.
</P>
<P>
   At Prudential Securities, technical analyst Ralph Acampora
attributed this week's volatile trading to technology stocks that
had become overbought and blue-chip stocks that were oversold.
</P>
<P>
   ``These gyrations are due primarily to the depressed nature of
the old-line companies and the stretched nature of the new economy
stocks,'' said Acampora.
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts believe that tech stocks will continue to dominate
the market as long as the Federal Reserve sticks to its policy of
fighting inflation with higher interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   Rising rates, aimed at slowing the economy's torrid growth, hurt
primarily the profit outlook of companies that need bank and other
loans to operate and expand.
</P>
<P>
   Internet, dot-com and other computer-related companies
apparently are less dependent on loans, using cash flow and equity
markets to fund expansions and operations.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts say that even the high-tech stocks will eventually
be hurt by rising rates if their low-tech customers and clients
can't buy their products and services.
</P>
<P>
   This is why Wall Street is intensely interested in what the Fed
does, watching for any snippet of evidence that inflation is not a
problem, or that the economy might be slowing.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts also believe the market itself may be playing into
the Fed's hands with every selloff, such as this week's Nasdaq
plunge.
</P>
<P>
   A slower market means less of a wealth effect and less consumer
spending, in this view. The Fed has made it clear that it is
concerned about the consumer's role as an engine of economic growth
and has been accused by critics of trying to engineer a stock
selloff.
</P>
<P>
   But as big as it was, some analysts believe the Nasdaq's selloff
only put a dent in the historic valuations of many technology
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is worrisome now is not the fact the market has a
divergence, but the size of it,'' said Legacy South strategist
Phillip Larkins.
</P>
<P>
   ``The S&AMP;P 500 is trading at 24 times earnings but the Nasdaq is
at 300 times earnings. It's not that the Nasdaq has taken center
stage, but that so many stocks are trading on the long-term hope
that technology leads to earnings. And the odds are that most
Internet companies won't be profitable even in the long term,''
said Larkins.
</P>
<P>
   While most of the investors' money is staying in the stock
market, enough is moving into Treasury bonds to push bond prices
higher and yields lower. This is still another boost to stocks,
since falling yields make bonds less attractive than stock returns.
</P>
<P>
   However the stock market indexes end the year, analysts say the
one certainty is that investors can look forward to a highly
volatile market.

VERMONT LEGISLATORS BACK `CIVIL UNIONS' FOR GAY COUPLES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CAREY GOLDBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTPELIER, Vt. _ A bill to create ``civil unions'' giving gay
and lesbian couples virtually all the benefits of marriage cleared
its most critical legislative hurdle and gained final approval in
the Vermont state House of Representatives obn Thursday night,
setting the stage for the state to adopt the most sweeping set of
rights for same-sex couples in the country.
</P>
<P>
   The pivotal, 76-69 vote came after hours of emotional debate on
topics from insurance to morality, and on the heels of an equally
close and hard-fought preliminary vote Wednesday night. The bill,
which gives spousal rights and privileges to same-sex couples, is
expected to pass more easily in the state Senate, , and Gov. Howard
Dean has said he will sign it, despite the deep schism the issue
has created among Vermonters.
</P>
<P>
   Meant to respond to a state Supreme Court ruling that same-sex
couples deserved all the same rights as heterosexual spouses, the
bill stopped short of calling the same-sex unions marriage, and in
fact, specified that marriage could only be between a man and a
woman.
</P>
<P>
   Though the civil union bill, laboriously forged by the House
Judiciary Committee over recent weeks, stops short of marriage, it
lays out an elaborate parallel and extremely similar institution of
``civil union'' that provides state recognition for same-sex
couples who cannot marry.
</P>
<P>
   Couples may apply for a license from a town clerk and receive a
certificate of civil union, the bill says. They then carry all the
benefits and responsibilities that spouses do, and if they split,
their union must be dissolved in a family court.
</P>
<P>
   For members of civil unions, the bill lists two dozen areas in
which the law would consider their roles to be just like those of
spouses, from child custody law to probate law to worker's
compensation to family leave benefits to immunity from being
compelled to testify.
</P>
<P>
   Backers of the bill said they did not expect other states to
recognize the legal status of Vermont's civil unions, so it did not
appear to raise any of the questions about ``full faith and
credit'' between states that a law allowing actual marriage would.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state.'' the bill says, ``has a strong interest in
promoting stable and lasting families, including families based
upon a same-sex couple.''
</P>
<P>
   The state may, but a great many of its citizens remain opposed
to the idea of same-sex unions, and locked in hot debate with the
many citizens who support it.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Complaining that it was marriage in all but name; the opponents
of the bill even distributed small yellow plastic ducks to
lawmakers, symbols of their ads arguing that if something looks,
talks and swims like a duck, then it is a duck. Several ducks could
be seen Thursday night sitting on lawmakers' desks.
</P>
<P>
   Backers of the bill said that though it fell short of actual
marriage, it marked real progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big step in the right direction,'' said Nina Beck, a
partner in one of the three same-sex couples whose suit challenging
the state's refusal to let them marry led to the state supreme
court's decision. ``It's not what we set out to do,'' said Beck,
who stood to rock her four-month-old son beneath the chamber's
gilt-framed portrait of George Washington during the debate, ``but
it's many steps ahead of where we are now.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if she and her partner, Stacy Jolles, would go to their
town clerk to request a civil union certificate, she said, ``Sign
us up!''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In an interesting sidelight to the issue of same-sex marriage,
the bill also provides a more limited set of benefits to blood
relatives in another institution it calls ``reciprocal
beneficiaries.'' Dealing mainly with medical decisions and funeral
arrangements, it was meant to address situations in which, for
example, widowed sisters live together and are effectively life
partners, yet the state recognizes no special relationship between
them.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also provided for an oversight commission that would
follow the results of the civil union law, ``note its strengths and
shortcomings,'' and report on them.

OSCAR CONTENDERS WASHINGTON, JOLIE AT WORK IN `THE BONE COLLECTOR'
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Rob Lowman's weekly video column.) 
By ROB LOWMAN 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As a thriller, ``The Bone Collector'' is a bit above average _
creepy enough, but a bit short on logic and believability.
</P>
<P>
   But it does boast two of this year's Oscar nominees in starring
roles _ Denzel Washington, who is up in the best actor category for
his role of wrongly convicted boxer Rubin Carter in ``Hurricane,''
and Angelina Jolie, who received the best supporting actress nod
for her role as the mentally disturbed teen, Lisa, in ``Girl,
Interrupted.'' Both already picked up Golden Globe Awards earlier
in the year, and Jolie won a Screen Actors Guild statuette on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Collector'' is another serial-killer story, the twist being
that Washington's character _ forensic detective Lincoln Rhyme _ is
a quadriplegic. Rhyme had been injured while investigating a crime.
He remains on the force, however _ albeit bedridden and surrounded
by an array of high-tech gadgetry _ and continues to help solve
crimes. Jolie plays Amelia Donaghy, a smart beat cop who Rhyme
recognizes has potential to be more.
</P>
<P>
   Jolie and Washington make a compelling combination, with both
playing variations of roles that they are known for. Even in action
roles, Washington comes across as cerebral, and _ except for
flashbacks to when his character wasn't paralyzed _ that's what you
see in this film. But Washington, a former best supporting actor
Oscar winner, can do a lot with a little. And while his Rhyme
character is fairly predictably drawn, Washington imbues him with
strength and dignity without overreaching, making him far more real
than any of the events in the movie.
</P>
<P>
   The characters Jolie plays, on the other hand, always seem
dangerous _ either to themselves, others or both. Donaghy is no
exception, carrying around a lot of past baggage. It's not the
character but Jolie's edginess, an animal-on-the-prowl quality,
that keeps you watching. Jolie, the daughter of Academy
Award-winning actor Jon Voight, has already picked up a couple of
Emmys. Oscar won't be far behind.
</P>
<P>
   Washington, who is nominated along with another former winner in
the best supporting actor category, Kevin Spacey, is a favorite to
win the Oscar. But win or lose, go back and check out some of
Washington's previous work, particularly in his films with Spike
Lee _ ``Mo Better Blues (1990), ``Malcolm X'' (1992) and ``He Got
Game'' (1998) Others include ``Cry Freedom'' (1987), in which he
played South African activist Steven Biko; ``Glory,'' for which he
won his Oscar; Carl Franklin's `Devil in a Blue Dress'' (1995),
which is based on the Walter Mosley novel; and ``Courage Under
Fire'' (1996).
</P>
<P>
   Jolie has a much shorter resume, but check out last year's
``Pushing Tin'' and ``Gia,'' the HBO movie where she played
outrageous supermodel Gia Carangi, who died of AIDS. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
MAKING SENSE
</P>
<P>
   Get ready for the force _ the force that will be brewing with
the VHS release of ``Star Wars: Episode 1 _ The Phantom Menace,''
on April 4. That's right, despite all the digital elements in the
film, George Lucas' prequel to his three hit films will not be
released on DVD. Go figure. But last year's surprise hit and this
year's Oscar nominee for best picture ``The Sixth Sense'' will come
out on DVD March 28. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   ``The Bone Collector'' (Universal) is priced for rental on VHS
($107.37) and is $29.98 on DVD. &QL;

 &HT;    Less star power, but more screen punch than fests past
 &HT;    By Chris Garcia
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ On Monday night at the South by Southwest party
on the roof of Waterloo Brewing Company, Louis Black confided to me
that this is the best SXSW Film Festival in its seven-year run.
</P>
<P>
   Well, sure. What else is the fest's senior director going to say
_ it's the worst? The most OK?
</P>
<P>
   This is only my third SXSW, but I'll vouch anyway for Black's
assessment. Star power might be at a premium _ despite Janeane
Garofalo and Jerry Stiller's appearance at the Paramount for
Sunday's premiere of ``The Independent'' _ but the lineup of 200
films has aroused more curiosity in this viewer than any other SXSW
festival.
</P>
<P>
   As of this writing, I've seen about eight festival films, few of
them stinkers. By the Saturday closing, that figure should hit 15.
(Black, on the other hand, said he's seen few if any of the movies
playing at his festival. No time. He's been zigzagging theaters,
introducing shows to the lucky ones who get to stay for them.)
</P>
<P>
   John Pierson, president of Grainy Pictures, host of the
Independent Film Channel's ``Split Screen'' and gleeful movie
gadfly, did not hesitate Wednesday to call this year's schedule ``a
good batch of films.''
</P>
<P>
   Adding muscle to the nine-day movie slate is an unusually strong
backwash of titles from the Sundance Film Festival. Most of these
circuit-cruisers have landed in the top ranks of SXSW offerings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Big Kahuna,'' a Kevin Spacey drama, has drawn droves (it
shows again Saturday). Repeating its Sundance buzz, Marc Singer's
documentary about New York's homeless mole people, ``Dark Days,''
became an instant festival classic, winning the senior programmers'
pick at Tuesday's awards ceremony. The word on Paul Stekler's
Sundance award-winner ``George Wallace: Settin' the Woods on Fire''
has been roundly euphoric. ``Just, Melvin'' and ``The Ballad of
Ramblin' Jack'' are must-see docs.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there have been a few stars pulling people in. On
panels and introducing their films were directors D.A. Pennebaker,
Monte Hellman, Marc Singer, the Hughes brothers, Gregory Nava, John
Carpenter and ``Exorcist'' screenwriter William Peter Blatty.
</P>
<P>
   Attending Austin luminaries have included director/writers
Stekler, Richard Linklater, Robert Rodriguez, Tim McCanlies, Larry
Wright, L.M. Kit Carson and Guillermo Del Toro.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday at the Alamo, Linklater gave a droll, heartfelt
introduction to Hellman's 1971 classic ``Two-Lane Blacktop'' _
still my favorite screening yet. ``This is a great night in my
cinematic life,'' gushed Linklater, who helped acquire the new
print from Universal.
</P>
<P>
   He called it the ``purest road movie ever'' and singled out
James Taylor's performance with the brilliant observation that he's
``like a refugee from a Robert Bresson movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Hellman praised us right back. ``From what I've seen so far, I
love Austin,'' said the director. ``It's a great city. You're lucky
to live here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Two-Lane Blacktop'' showed many signs of age, all of them
exquisite. Its laid-back humor and underlying angst, not to mention
killer performances by Taylor, Dennis Wilson and the inimitable
Warren Oates, braced in ways movies rarely do anymore.
</P>
<P>
   My first SXSW movie this year was a bust. I groaned watching the
cheesy Abbie Hoffman biopic ``Steal This Movie!,'' which premiered
last Friday night at the Paramount. Vincent D'Onofrio was game but
unconvincing as the puckish political agitator, while comedian
Garofalo made tortured essays into dramatic acting. The film's
title, I think, is wishful thinking. I doubt they could give away
this movie.
</P>
<P>
   I like to crow about my outsized appreciation for esoteric
art-filmmaker Peter Greenaway, whose ``The Cook, the Thief, His
Wife and Her Lover'' is a personal favorite. I'm also a big fan of
``The Draughtsman's Contract,'' ``The Belly of an Architect,''
``Drowning by Numbers,'' ``A Zed and Two Noughts'' _ you get the
idea. These films strike a prepossessing balance between
Greenaway's painterly exuberance and challenging thematic
obsessions.
</P>
<P>
   But somewhere around ``Prospero's Books'' and ``The Pillow
Book'' Greenaway's films have lurched from mesmerizing to
impenetrable. So with ``8 1/2 Women,'' which got its U.S. premiere
Saturday at the Paramount. A beautiful bore, this oblique homage to
Greenaway's kindred spirit, Fellini, traffics in the filmmaker's
familiar compulsions: sex, the flesh, death, beauty, class
distinctions and the tyranny of mathematical order.
</P>
<P>
   Throngs came out to the Paramount on Monday night for the Hughes
brothers' documentary ``American Pimp,'' a SXSW main attraction.
The film's taken flak since its premiere at Sundance in 1999, so I
had low expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pimp'' proved a gritty, revelatory pleasure. The intimate tour
of urban underworlds grooved to the beat of funk and hip-hop,
shining a dim light into filthy pockets of America that exhilarated
as they repelled.
</P>
<P>
   As of this morning, there are 39 screenings left at SXSW. You
can find me tonight at the John Cusack comedy ``High Fidelity'' and
the professional wrestling documentary ``Beyond the Mat.'' On
Saturday I'll be heading to Hellman's offbeat western ``Ride in the
Whirlwind,'' ``Noriega: God's Favorite'' and ``The Big Kahuna.''
</P>
<P>
   Best one yet. Black says so. So do I.

<P>
   Two years ago, William O. Daniel's doctor adopted a new policy.
No longer would the doctor, Herbert Rubin of Beverly Hills, Calif.,
accept payments from health maintenance organizations. No longer
would he be on insurance companies' preferred provider lists. No
longer would he even accept Medicare. From then on, if you wanted
to see Rubin, you paid cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was frightening to me,'' said Daniel, a 72-year-old
retired insurance salesman who lives in Hollywood. Reluctantly, he
changed doctors. But, he said, his new doctor's waiting room was
always crowded, and the doctor seemed pressed for time. ``I had to
get out my symptoms in about 20 seconds or he would start
interrupting me,'' Daniel said. ``Then I would have to wait while
he saw more patients and then got back to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Daniel has returned to Rubin, one of a growing number of
doctors who have severed their ties to health maintenance
organizations and insurance companies. In return for cash payments,
the doctors often offer a lavish level of service _ uncrowded
waiting rooms, long, uninterrupted office visits, and an office
staff that knows the patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always get what you pay for,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly seven years after President Clinton's failed effort to
remake health care in America, the health care market is remaking
itself. For those with insurance or the money to pay for health
care, there is evolving a two-tiered system. One tier is made up of
doctors who have cut their prices at the insistence of health
insurers and who make up for the reduced prices by increasing their
volume, seeing more patients per hour. The other tier is made up of
those like Rubin who offer time and attention _ but at a price.
</P>
<P>
   While there are no national figures on how many doctors are
joining the new tier, health care experts agreed that all of a
sudden, doctors who never before dared to abandon health insurance
plans were taking the plunge.
</P>
<P>
   They are a different breed from the growing ranks of doctors who
are focusing their practices on cosmetic procedures, like laser eye
surgery or liposuction, that patients pay for out of their own
pockets. Instead, these are doctors who provide basic medical care,
like family practitioners and internists, as well as specialists,
like general surgeons, gastroenterologists, psychiatrists and
psychologists and cardiologists, who take care of serious medical
problems. These renegade doctors tend to be in urban areas, where
managed care has made the greatest inroads, the doctors said.
</P>
<P>
   Patients of these doctors can submit the doctors' bills to their
insurance companies, but it is the patient, not the doctor, who
must accept whatever the insurer provides. Some of these doctors
accept Medicare payments or payments from a few other select
insurance plans. Others, like Rubin, do not. Some doctors are
asking patients to give them yearly retainers of thousands of
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market is reasserting itself,'' said Dr. Alan Garber, an
economist and specialist in internal medicine at Stanford
University. ``In characteristic fashion in America, markets have
emerged where they didn't exist.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Health policy experts say patients who see doctors like Rubin
are not buying better health _ they are buying more of a doctor's
time and attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are buying what to them is very valuable,'' said Victor
R. Fuchs, an emeritus professor of health economics at Stanford.
``They are getting instant attention, instant service. You call the
doctor's office and one person is on the phone and he knows you.
Suppose you have a medical test. In some situations you have to
wait a week for the results. Here, it can be two hours. What some
experts don't realize is that a huge amount of the dissatisfaction
with medical care has to do with the level of service.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Doctors and health policy experts differ on whether the trend is
to be lauded, accepted or deplored. But they agree that it was
inevitable, a consequence of peoples' growing irritation with
impersonal medical care by rushed doctors and a booming economy
that allows many people to pay for the service they want. Thomas
Reardon, a general practitioner who is president of the American
Medical Association, said that his organization had no policy on
the trend, but that he understood why it was occurring.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the doctors are saying is, `We're tired of managed care,
we're tired of Medicare, we're tired of the hassle,''' Reardon
said. Patients are equally peeved by much of medical care today, he
added.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But some worry about a loss of fundamental equity and justice,
and feel that the affluent are insulating themselves. ``We are in
an incredibly entrepreneurial climate in medicine, and I think this
kind of tiering undercuts people's thinking about collective
solutions to the health care problems,'' said Norman Daniels, a
professor of philosophy at Tufts University who specializes in
ethics and health care.
</P>
<P>
   Others worry about the effects on patients when their doctors
suddenly announce that they will not accept the patients'
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a burden,'' said Bernard Katz, a family practitioner who
sees HMO patients and is co-chief executive of SMBP Health
Services, a company in Santa Monica, Calif., that manages doctors
like himself.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Michael Lockshin, a rheumatologist at the Hospital for Special
Surgery in New York, said that in his hospital it is becoming
almost impossible to find surgeons who will accept HMO insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``They basically thumb their noses at the HMOs,'' Lockshin said,
adding that he often cannot refer patients to the best surgeons.
``I have to deal with patients on a daily basis, and it sometimes
makes me want to tear my hair out.''
</P>
<P>
   The same thing is happening in west Los Angeles as more and more
specialists refuse payments from HMOs and most insurance companies,
said Dr. Richard L. Taw Jr., a cardiologist in Santa Monica. Taw
himself has stopped accepting most insurance payments, but his
patients stuck with him. ``Nobody left me, not one patient,'' he
said. ``The economy is so good now that people want to go to
doctors that don't treat them like a number.''

   Not too long ago, it was excruciatingly difficult for an
independent doctor to thrive. One who tried, Dr. Thomas W.
LaGrelius, a general practitioner in Torrance, Calif., said he
spent years watching helplessly as his patients bailed out of his
practice, refusing to go to a doctor whose fees were not covered by
their insurance. LaGrelius had decided as long ago as 1980 that he
wanted no part of HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   When his partners decided to stay with an HMO, LaGrelius quit
the group and began practicing by himself, but for years he had
trouble finding patients.
</P>
<P>
   Now, LaGrelius said, the climate has changed, and patients are
seeking him out. He is head of an organization of independent
doctors in his area, called Indoc, which has 104 members and gets
inquiries from all over the country.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Some doctors, who once belonged to every HMO in sight, said they
recently decided to drop those contracts. When HMOs came to the New
York City area in large numbers the 1990s, doctors like Andrew
Weiland, an orthopedic hand and plastic surgeon at the Hospital for
Special Surgery, were afraid that if they did not join they would
have no patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone jumped on the bandwagon and joined as many as they
could for fear of being left off when the train left the station,''
Weiland said. But, he added: ``You can only run so fast and see so
many patients and not run an assembly line.''
</P>
<P>
   So Weiland started to drop his HMO contracts, one by one, over a
period of about three years. He said he has had no trouble finding
patients. ``Patients sort of think that if you're out of the plans,
you must be good enough to drop out of the plans,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The independent doctors say they see fewer patients and offer
them better services. The doctors are easy to reach, patients are
not kept on hold, and no one has to wait weeks for an appointment.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley Fenton, a Philadelphia internist who does not accept
payments from HMOs, says he offers ``time and attention.'' He
reserves an hour for a new patient who comes in for a physical
examination and allows 15 to 20 minutes for follow-up visits.
</P>
<P>
   ``While it may cost more,'' Fenton said, ``many can afford it if
they want to. Instead of going out to dinner one night one week,
they can spend an hour with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Richard Schubert, a fee-for-service internist in Washington,
said he spends whatever time it takes with his patients _ 30
minutes for a routine office visit, an hour for a consultation.
``It costs patients more money, they have to pay for it out of
pocket, they have to decide if they think it's good value for the
service,'' he said. ``Maybe you think spending the extra money on a
doctor is not important and you'd rather get a BMW. You have to
decide how you want to spend your money.''
</P>
<P>
   Many patients say that they are willing to pay the price for a
doctor who showers them with attention. Harry Haber, the president
of Ginsey Industries, a company in Bellmawr, N.J., that
manufactures and distributes novelty bathroom accessories, said he
provides an Aetna/US Healthcare health maintenance organization for
his 150 employees and himself. But he and his wife are patients of
Fenton of Philadelphia, paying most of the cost themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not everyone can afford it,'' Haber said. But, he added, ``I
am a person who's made a choice.'' He added that when Fenton
suggests an expensive test he may go to his Aetna doctor and hope
that he will recommend the same test, so it can be paid for by
Aetna.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is not always easy,'' Haber said. In fact, he recently
was turned down for a medical test by his Aetna doctor, forcing him
into a decision on whether to pay for it himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will probably absorb the cost,'' Haber said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM
</P>
<P>
   Health care economists predict that the two-tiered system may be
here to stay and that no national health care plan is going to
obviate it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The notion that you're going to provide the same level of care
for everyone,'' Fuchs of Stanford said, ``means either that it's
going to be enormously expensive or that it's going to be a level
of care that's far below what some people are willing and able to
pay for.''
</P>
<P>
   But, said Uwe Reinhardt, a health economist at Princeton
University, doctors with fee-for-service practices may find
themselves under a new sort of competitive pressure. People who can
afford such doctors also tend to be people who are comfortable
using computers and the Internet, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will create Web sites that will rank these doctors on
quality,'' Reinhardt said. ``That will be the obvious next step.
They will put these doctors into statistical fishbowls where
everything about these doctors will be on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the physicians will find it is not quite the world of
the late 1950s and the 1960s,'' Reinhardt said. ``It will be
utterly brutal.''

 &HT;    `Exorcist' scares even its writer
 &HT;    By Chris Garcia
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Screenwriter William Peter Blatty showed up at
the Paramount Theatre for Wednesday night's world premiere
screening of the new, expanded version of ``The Exorcist.'' So did
a bat.
</P>
<P>
   Blatty, wearing a spiffy sweater, came first. He introduced an
immaculate new print of the evergreen 1973 thriller, which he
considers ``a supernatural detective story'' _ a surprise to
legions of damaged filmgoers who have always considered the film a
lethal horror movie capable of obliterating many a good night's
slumber.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the bat, which fluttered about with possessed abandon
in front of the screen just as Satan was pulling up the moving van
to take residency inside little Regan MacNeil, indelibly played by
chubby-cheeked Linda Blair. The bat furnished a redundant spooky
touch to the evening, eliciting nervous titters from the large
crowd. Batty, meet Blatty.
</P>
<P>
   Blatty, who also produced the film and wrote the novel on which
it's based, said 11 minutes were restored to ``The Exorcist,''
footage that director William Friedkin was pressured to pare for
length. This version, shown as part of the South by Southwest Film
Festival, features unseen sequences, including some crowd-pleasing
jolts (beware Blair's contortionist crab walk down the stairs),
silly semi-subliminal images and a happier ending.
</P>
<P>
   Made for $12 million, ``The Exorcist'' has made $400 million
worldwide. It was the highest-grossing horror movie in U.S. history
until ``The Sixth Sense'' surpassed it.
</P>
<P>
   Upon its release, the Catholic Church condemned the film.
Critics reviled it as trashy and misogynistic. Some filmgoers
passed out from fear.
</P>
<P>
   Blatty asked the Paramount crowd, ``How many of you have never
seen `The Exorcist' on the big screen?''
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of hands shot up.
</P>
<P>
   Blatty grinned. ``Good luck,'' he said. The house lights dimmed.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why do you think ``The Exorcist'' has stood the test of time
as potently as it has?
</P>
<P>
   A: The truthful answer is that it's been a mystery to me. We can
say all the obvious things: beautifully acted, beautifully
directed, all of that. But I think it has to do with the desire for
religious belief. I really think that's at the heart of it. It's
kind of a spiritual ``Rocky.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's amazing is how seriously the film is taken. It hasn't
grown a camp quotient that could degrade its terror. Audiences
still take it on its own terms, and it's perceived as it was 27
years ago. ...
</P>
<P>
   A: It is. It has the same power and effect it had on its
original audiences. I know when I'm forced to watch it I'm very
clinical. And then at the end, at some point during the exorcism, I
look down at my hands and they're tightly gripping the arms of the
chair. So something has gotten to me. It has a tremendous power
that's kind of mysterious. Billy Graham said there's a force in
this movie, right in the film itself. He meant a source of evil of
some kind. But at least he perceived that there is a power in it
that's extremely mysterious.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Clearly you like this version much better.
</P>
<P>
   A: Oh, yeah. I liked it the first time I saw it 26 years ago. I
know one executive told Friedkin that the end of the movie had to
be when Father Dyer (the Rev. William O'Malley) stares down the
empty steps. We had (the new scenes) in the picture originally.
This version has been my idea for years. I wanted it always.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The upbeat ending is especially noticeable. What does it add
to the film?
</P>
<P>
   A: It lets you know everything's OK and that it's not a downer.
Too many people are not watching closely enough. They think the
demon took Father Karras (Jason Miller) out the window. If you
watch closely, you know that isn't true. But if you're all sad and
gloomy at the end, you think maybe the demon did. This tells you
everything's OK.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Was the pea soup your idea?
</P>
<P>
   A: (Laughs.) The vomit was in the book and the script.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Was it described as the green gruel we see flying at faces?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, because bile would be greenish, yellow-green. Mixing in
the oatmeal was someone else's idea. (Laughs.)
</P>
<P>
   Q: Didn't Pauline Kael call itmisogynistic?
</P>
<P>
   A: You know what she called it? In her review she said, ``This
film is the biggest recruiting poster for the Catholic Church since
`Going My Way.''' She just hated it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What about those critics who did call it viciously
misogynistic?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's just ludicrous overanalysis.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've always been a little perplexed by the connection of the
opening scenes in the Iraqi desert to the rest of the film. The new
version seems to take pains to bridge a connection.
</P>
<P>
   A: We added one more bridge in there, that subliminal image of
(the demon statue) on the bedroom door. But we always had that
large superimposure of it during the exorcism.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's it mean? Did Father Merrin (Max von Sydow)
inadvertently bring the devil back with him?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. It's nothing. Nobody brought anything back. The demon, I
think, came back to Merrin for another round.

EUROPE'S CENTRAL BANK RAISES INTEREST RATE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: shorted; no byline) 
(pr) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ As if it had needed an extra two weeks to
summon up its courage, the European Central Bank followed up its
warnings of inflation Thursday and nudged up its core interest
rate.
</P>
<P>
   The increase, to 3.5 percent from 3.25 percent, did not come as
a surprise, but the way the central bank went about it left many
economists perplexed.
</P>
<P>
   Bank officials have warned for at least a month about the
``upward risks'' of inflation in Europe. That, combined with the
slumping value of the euro, led many experts to believe the bank
would tighten monetary policy when its board of governors met two
weeks ago. That did not happen. Instead, the bank held rates steady
as its president, Wim Duisenberg, strongly suggested that rates
would rise in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   Most economists had assumed the central bank would wait until
its board meeting at the end of March, because that is the next
meeting to be followed by a news conference. But instead, the bank
raised rates Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   A growing number of analysts have become frustrated with the
bank's conflicting signals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had expected a move two weeks ago, when the ECB published a
statement that basically read like an explanation for a rate
hike,'' said Stefan Bergheim, an economist with Merrill Lynch in
Frankfurt. ``Why wait two weeks? I have no explanation for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Economists say that the arguments favoring a rate increase, and
probably another one in addition to Thursday's, are compelling.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Investors bought stocks furiously on Thursday,
sending the Dow Jones industrial average up nearly 500 points in
its biggest one-day point gain ever. Broader indexes also rose
sharply as investors _ at least for the day _ put aside fears that
the Federal Reserve will aggressively raise interest rates and slow
the economy to a crawl.
</P>
<P>
   When trading began, buyers flocked to the old economy companies
that make up the bulk of the stock market but that have languished
much of this year. Stocks of financial companies such as J.P.
Morgan performed especially well, as did shares of airlines and
other companies whose profits will probably be strong if the U.S.
economy stays healthy.
</P>
<P>
   But by mid-afternoon, the buying had spread to technology and
Internet companies, new economy stocks that had already posted
strong gains this year. By the end of the day, all segments of the
market were sharply higher, with the Dow Jones industrials rising
499 points, or nearly 5 percent, to 10,631.
</P>
<P>
   The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index ended three days of
sharp losses with a gain of nearly 3 percent. Apparently afraid
that they would miss out on gains, investors scurried to join the
rally, setting a record for trading on the New York Stock Exchange,
with 1.5 billion shares changing hands.
</P>
<P>
   By any standard, the gains were outsized. Venerable old economy
companies like American Express and General Motors saw their stocks
dance like new technology butterflies, with American Express
gaining $10.25, to $143.125, and GM $4.9375, to $83.75.
</P>
<P>
   The performance of the broader Standard and Poor's 500 index was
equally giddy. The S&AMP;P 500, which represents about 70 percent of
the value of all U.S. stocks, rose 66 points, or 4.8 percent, to
1,458.74. The point gain was the biggest for the Dow ever, easily
surpassing a 380.53 point rise in September 1998. But in percentage
terms, the two gains were about the same, 4.9 percent. Combined
with Wednesday's 3.3 percent increase, Thursday's gain amounted to
the best two-day performance for the index since its rally after
the crash of October 1987.
</P>
<P>
   ``A calm is settling in over the market on interest rates,''
said James Weiss, deputy chief investment officer of State Street
Research, which manages $55 billion. ``The market at the moment
seems to be comfortable that the Fed is going to raise interest
rates a couple of times but not more than that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve has raised short-term interest rates four
times since June in an effort to slow the booming economy, and Fed
Chairman Alan Greenspan has said he is worried about the potential
for inflation to accelerate. Along with higher oil prices, the
higher interest rates appear to have slowed the economy slightly,
said Jeffrey Applegate, chief investment strategist for Lehman
Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   Applegate, a longtime bull, said a moderate economic slowdown is
good news for stocks, because it means that over the next few
months, the Federal Reserve will not have to raise rates as much as
investors previously expected. So investors can begin to look well
past the expected quarter-point increase by the Fed policy makers
next week to another period of steady interest rates and strong
corporate profits. That combination almost always makes for higher
stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``If, in fact, the Fed can go on hold, because there's not a
reason to do a lot of tightening, that's good for the markets,''
Applegate said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Greenspan has expressed concern that the meteoric rise in
technology stocks is encouraging spending by consumers who feel
increasingly wealthy on paper. Their spending could in turn fuel
inflation. To lessen that risk, Greenspan has said he would like
stock prices to grow more slowly, a warning heeded by technology
investors in the previous three days but disregarded on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street traders, who were even more swamped than usual on
Thursday, said buy orders seemed to come from all directions. While
investors' appetite for stock mutual funds has abated from its
record highs in February, when it averaged $10 billion per week, it
remains strong, according AMG Data Services of Arcata, Calif. AMG,
which tracks investment in mutual funds, said $5 billion went into
stock funds in the week ended Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The day began rather quietly. A few minutes after the opening
bell on the New York Stock Exchange, the Dow was up fewer than 100
points. The Nasdaq composite, which has been extremely volatile
lately and was down more than 9 percent the previous three days,
opened up, but fell sharply toward midday. Shortly after 11 a.m.,
it was down more than 100 points.
</P>
<P>
   As the day progressed, the Dow rocketed higher, and by
mid-afternoon, it had pulled the Nasdaq into positive territory.
From there, old economy and new economy stocks sprinted, closing
the day near their highs.

   TAIPEI, Taiwan _ ``I have heard the rumors of various rates
being paid to buy votes, and I solemnly declare that this is not an
activity of my party,'' says the man on the screen, who bears an
uncanny resemblance to President Lee Teng-hui.
</P>
<P>
   ``When my party buys votes, it pays a uniform rate,'' says the
character, working himself into an arm-waving frenzy. ``We offer
the fairest deal! No bargaining!''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not right, I didn't mean that!'' he adds a moment
later, capping a deft caricature of the real Lee's penchant for
blurting out things that require, as they say, some later
clarification.
</P>
<P>
   Exuberant elections are evidence of Taiwan's transition from
dictatorship to democracy, but an unsparing and hilarious satire of
the politicians on the air weekday nights on cable television here
may be the ultimate proof.
</P>
<P>
   Performed live and homing in on the day's news, the show also
provides welcome comic relief from the campaign for Saturday's
presidential election, which is understandably driven by weighty
issues of war and peace that have engaged the Taiwanese people in
endlessly earnest conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel that everybody is too up-tight in this election,'' the
show's originator, Bobby Hou, said the other night as his Lee
Teng-hui makeup was being applied. ``Everybody should relax!''
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to test where the breaking point of this new democracy
is,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   In their quest to skewer all the new candidates equally, Hou and
his ensemble say, they have an easy time harvesting satirical
material from the campaign's cant and mudslinging.
</P>
<P>
   The show is called ``An Appointment With the Chairman,'' the
chairman being Lee, who in actuality may derive more power from his
chairmanship of the long-governing Nationalist Party, or
Kuomintang, than from his elected office. While Lee is not himself
a candidate, the specter of his personality and policies pervades
the presidential race and, as portrayed by Hou, it also provides
the show with a comic center.
</P>
<P>
   A veteran comic actor of 35, Hou has mastered the impulsive,
messianic speech, the sometimes rustic mannerisms and the memorable
expressions on the face of Taiwan's president.
</P>
<P>
   Filling out the ensemble are equally piercing impersonators of
the three main candidates, who together with Hou perform sketches
that are only slightly battier than reality.
</P>
<P>
   The three candidate-characters are Vice President Lien Chan, who
in real life is Lee's chosen successor and is never allowed to
forget it; Chen Shui-bian of the Democratic Progressive Party, a
crusading idealist who has been accused of expedient flip-flops
including a retreat from his longtime advocacy of formal
independence for Taiwan; and James Soong, a former Lee protege and
Nationalist star who bolted to run an independent campaign as a
white knight reformer.
</P>
<P>
   Each show is hastily written by a team that draws on the latest
scandals and gaffes. The actors give the script one quick read
together, just before air time, and then they suddenly morph into
their roles.
</P>
<P>
   In Thursday night's show, the Chen Shui-bian character does his
best to dispel the fears dogging the candidate that he will provoke
a war with China, which has threatened to use force to block
Taiwan's independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guarantee that if elected I will not declare Taiwan's
independence,'' the character says, ``At least until my son has
finished his military service.''
</P>
<P>
   A sketch earlier this week captured Lee's tendency to patronize
his candidate, Lien, as well as the rumor-mongering that all sides
have used as a campaign tactic.
</P>
<P>
   Dismissing stories that the seemingly strait-laced and very
married Lien had visited a massage parlor, the Lee character said,
``The Lien Chan I know never went to a massage parlor. When he
wants to find a woman he doesn't need to go to a massage parlor!''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not right, I didn't mean that!'' he continued.
``Anyway, it was a legitimate massage parlor.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lien character, like his real-life counterpart wearing a cap
and golf jacket to counter his image as a rich and aloof man who
was handed all his high positions, sits pathetically grinning and
then says, ``I work very hard all day long _ in an air conditioned
office.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I didn't mean that!'' he adds.
</P>
<P>
   Lampooning leaders this way would land an actor in jail in
mainland China, and until quite recently it was considered over the
top in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Only two years ago, Hou said, he tried a similar political
satire at another network. It was canceled after one episode, he
said, because of objections from the supposedly liberal Democratic
Progressive Party, which partly controlled the network.
</P>
<P>
   He shopped the idea at several other channels until Gala TV, a
local network, agreed and three months ago the nightly skewering
began.
</P>
<P>
   The 45-minute show has a modest but growing number of loyal
viewers, though its ratings remain well below those of the real
nightly news. In a tacit acknowledgment of its popularity, all
three major candidates are showing commercials during the breaks _
and risking the juxtaposition of comic portrayals and the
embarrassingly similar images in their ads.
</P>
<P>
   In another mix with the real world, each night after the initial
scripted skit, Hou and his comrades take live calls from viewers. A
surprising number try to speak sincerely, only to find themselves
teased. When a woman called to say she preferred James Soong for
president, Hou as President Lee answered, ``I guarantee that you'll
get a big tax bill at the end of this month,'' a reference to the
Nationalist Party's alleged habit of abusing government powers and
its legal hounding of the renegade Soong.
</P>
<P>
   Hou said that in previous incarnations he had played Mao
Tse-tung, the founder of Communist China, and Jiang Zemin, China's
current president and Communist Party leader, but Taiwanese were
not much interested. But if China ever does reclaim Taiwan, will he
lampoon Jiang?
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course!'' he replied.
</P>
<P>
   Hou said he hopes to continue with the show after the election,
and it appears that Lee may keep on providing raw material, since
he has expressed his intention to stay on as Nationalist Party
chairman until his term runs out more than a year from now.
</P>
<P>
   That was grist for a sketch this week in which the Lee character
said: ``Ignore those rumors that I'm going to step down as party
chairman. I'm telling you, I'm going to stay forever!''
</P>
<P>
   He paused a second, then continued: ``That's not right. I didn't
mean that!''

U.S. TROOPS IN KOSOVO HOLD 9 SUSPECTED REBELS
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   STUBLINA, Yugoslavia _ U.S. peacekeeping troops were holding
nine men in detention Thursday who were suspected of involvement in
a cross-border insurgency from Kosovo against the Serbian police.
</P>
<P>
   The men were detained on Wednesday during the peacekeepers'
raids on ethnic Albanian villages and strongholds along Kosovo's
border with Serbia proper.
</P>
<P>
   Helicopters and about 350 infantry soldiers took part in the
operation, which was reported to have gone smoothly, with no
resistance by residents and no casualties. The troops discovered 22
crates of ammunition and weapons, as well as uniforms and equipment
for a sizable number of guerrillas in several locations.
</P>
<P>
   The raids followed an intensive diplomatic effort by U.S.
officials to warn Kosovo Albanians against stirring up trouble in
the border region and provoking a conflict with Serbian forces that
could spill back into Kosovo itself.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department spokesman, James Rubin, met this week with
former Kosovo guerrilla leaders and political leaders from both
Kosovo and the Presevo region in Serbia, telling them that the West
would not come to their aid if violence escalated. Last year, NATO
waged a 78-day bombing campaign to force Serbian forces out of
Kosovo to end the repression of ethnic Albanians there.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and NATO Supreme Commander
Gen. Wesley Clark have also warned Albanians not to start an
insurgency in southern Serbia, home to some 70,000 Albanians. The
raids on Wednesday were clearly intended to reinforce that message
and break up the incipient guerrilla network.
</P>
<P>
   Villagers in Stublina, one of the border villages that was
searched extensively on Wednesday, took the treatment fairly
meekly. They complained only of being made to stand out in the cold
all day while the troops went through their houses and farm
buildings. There were no complaints of rough treatment or about the
purpose of the operation itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is their duty to check for weapons,'' said Rahman Osmani,
60, whose house was searched while his family was made to stand in
the field. ``We have nothing against that.''
</P>
<P>
   Only one villager, Zeqir Zeqiri, 36, was detained when a machine
gun was found in a storeroom in the family compound. His brother
said the weapon belonged to a cousin who did not live in the
village.
</P>
<P>
   Some Albanians have vowed to fight to defend Albanian villages
in southern Serbia, and have until now been moving relatively
freely across the long porous border. Peacekeeping troops search
cars and people moving along the main roads, but insurgents can
also pass easily through the wooded hills.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, armed guerrillas appeared in the village of Dobrosin,
just 500 yards into Serbia from a U.S. checkpoint on the border and
close to Stublina. Wednesday's raids were aimed to cut off the
guerrillas' supply and staging posts.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials fear that an insurgency in the border region
would give the Serbian police reason to attack the Albanians in
Serbia, and start a conflict that could draw in NATO-led
peacekeepers. Increased instability on the border and a flood of
refugees into Kosovo would also aggravate the already volatile
situation in the province.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's haul of weapons and equipment provided evidence that
the handful of guerrillas seen in Dobrosin have a larger backup
organization. All raided sites were within a mile of the Serbian
border. U.S. military officials said that in addition to the crates
of ammunition, they had found more than 200 uniforms, mortar tubes,
hand grenades, a few rifles, mines, rucksacks, field rations,
medical supplies, sleeping bags, explosives and fuses.
</P>
<P>
   One location was on a remote hilltop, where several buildings
were protected by a minefield and appeared to be a staging post for
fighters, a U.S. military spokeswoman said. Four men were caught
while trying to get away as troops closed in on the area.
</P>
<P>
   The nine detained men are being held at Camp Bondsteel, a U.S.
base in eastern Kosovo, and will appear before a magistrate who
will decide whether they should stand trial, the spokeswoman said.

 &HT;    More data on DNA may be OK
 &HT;    By Peter Mantius
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In April 1993, a 30-year-old woman was awakened by a
knife-wielding intruder who blindfolded and raped her before
fleeing her apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Police had no leads until last year, when the Georgia Bureau of
Investigation's Crime Lab began comparing biological evidence
collected from the scenes of unsolved rapes with samples of DNA
taken from convicted sex offenders.
</P>
<P>
   They matched the Roswell crime evidence with the DNA of John
Scieszka, a former welder serving a life term for raping five
University of Georgia women in 1995 and 1996. Last June, Scieszka
pleaded guilty to the Roswell attack.
</P>
<P>
   Now the state is poised to expand its 8-year-old DNA program
from collecting about 1,000 samples a year from sex offenders to
nearly 40,000 from all felons. If legislation backed by Lt. Gov.
Mark Taylor passes as expected, Georgia will move to the forefront
of the national movement to expand state DNA databases and link
them together.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor predicts Georgia's new system will ``provide the proof to
solve literally hundreds of unsolved crimes,'' deter future crimes
and exonerate innocent prisoners who were wrongly convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta defense attorney Jack Martin said he believes it's
``just a matter of time'' before DNA evidence frees a Georgia death
row inmate.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the great revolutions in solving crimes, for
both sides,'' said Martin, legislative adviser for the Georgia
Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers. ``It helps find criminals,
but it's an opportunity to exonerate people who in the past would
have been convicted on what we thought was reliable evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   This week, state lawmakers were trying to agree on how much to
compensate a Clayton County man convicted of rape after DNA
evidence showed he didn't commit the crime. Calvin Johnson was
freed in June after 16 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's DNA database has produced relatively few spectacular
prosecutions or exonerations. Usually, its benefits are far less
dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mostly we link one unsolved crime to another,'' said George
Herrin, director of the GBI's Crime Lab. ``We get one or two of
those a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Florida, where they've been doing a lot more samples than
us for three or four years, has a rate of association 10 to 12
times ours,'' Herrin said. ``I think (Taylor's bill) will help
solve a lot of crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia is the latest state to look at increased collection of
DNA as a law-enforcement _ and criminal defense _ tool. Several
states also have increased the numbers of crimes eligible for
testing. DNA samples can be obtained from blood, saliva, hair, skin
or semen. The GBI currently collects blood samples from sex
criminals and keeps them in refrigerated storage at its
headquarters east of Atlanta. Evidence experts catalogue the DNA
characteristics of each sample and store the information on
computer files.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor's bill would expand that program so anyone convicted of a
felony after July 1, 2000, would be tested. Felons already in
prison would be tested upon release, if not sooner. The state
expects to pay about $35 per sample, excluding personnel costs. The
total cost would be about about $2.2 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   Critics believe such testing threatens constitutional privacy
protections.
</P>
<P>
   Debbie Seagraves, executive director of the American Civil
Liberties Union of Georgia, argued that the DNA database will be
too large, and too vulnerable to outsiders, such as insurance
companies snooping for genetic health tendencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you compile large databases, that information can
never be entirely secure, either due to carelessness or greed,''
Seagraves said. ``You don't even need DNA in nonviolent crimes, or
in most violent crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Herrin said rape is the crime most likely to yield useful DNA
evidence. But even in rapes, he said, semen of the attacker is not
present about 30 percent of the time. Many other violent crimes
don't provide DNA evidence either. ``If you have a drive-by
shooting, it's extremely unlikely,'' Herrin said.
</P>
<P>
   But when DNA evidence is available, it often raises questions
about the reliability of other forms of evidence, Martin said.
That's why Martin helped convince legislators to allow defendants,
prisoners and their lawyers to have carefully controlled access to
the DNA database as a means to try to establish their innocence.
</P>
<P>
   Martin said uncontaminated DNA samples from crime scenes, when
properly handled, are extremely reliable evidence. ``In fact, it's
brought home how unreliable eyewitnesses and confidential
informants and circumstantial evidence are,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Herrin said police often arrest suspects and later determine
their DNA does not match crime scene evidence. Although such
mismatches occur 20 percent to 30 percent of the time during the
GBI's DNA testing, Herrin said, failure to match doesn't prove
conclusively that the suspect is innocent.
</P>
<P>
   It does strongly suggest innocence, however, Martin said.
``That's scary, because those are cases that probably would have
been prosecuted (if not for DNA testing), and the eyewitnesses were
flat wrong.''

EX-GORE AIDES ARE FAULTED IN IRS CASE
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two aides to Vice President Al Gore improperly
called the Internal Revenue Service on the same day in early 1997
seeking information on a tax case of interest to a union whose
president was scheduled to meet with Gore the following day,
congressional investigators said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators, staff members of the bipartisan Joint
Committee on Taxation, said in a report made public Thursday that
the two aides ``appear to have attempted to obtain taxpayer return
information to which they were not entitled.'' Federal law bars
almost any release of information by the IRS about specific
taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   Lindy L. Paull, the committee's chief of staff, said many
details of the episode were fuzzy and that she was constrained by
taxpayer confidentiality from identifying the union. But Paull said
at a news conference that the calls, which were rebuffed by the
IRS, raised questions about whether the vice president's office had
created at least the ``appearance of influence'' on behalf of a
group with ties to Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush of Texas seized on the report, describing
the calls as part of a pattern, including the vice president's fund
raising at a Buddhist temple and his fund-raising calls from the
White House, that cast doubt on Gore's fitness to hold the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Gore, Laura Quinn, said the vice president's
staff had followed all White House procedures for contacting the
tax service and had done nothing improper in making what amounted
to a routine status check on the case.
</P>
<P>
   Quinn said that the information in the committee's report was
wrong in many respects, that Gore's schedule showed no meetings
with union officials in January 1997 and that the two staff members
had both left the White House and could not remember the phone
calls.
</P>
<P>
   She said that based on the information provided by the
committee, she did not know what union might have been involved.
Gore's office said it was also checking to see whether the vice
president had met with any union leaders in February 1997, but that
it did not yet have an answer.
</P>
<P>
   The report by the Joint Committee on Taxation focused on
accusations that the IRS had investigated, audited or generally
treated unfairly tax-exempt conservative groups that were at odds
politically with the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   It concluded that there was ``no credible evidence'' that the
groups had been targeted by the tax service. But in the course of
its investigation, the committee said it came across two instances
where the administration had made what it termed ``nonroutine
contacts'' with the IRS.
</P>
<P>
   The first involved an inquiry by a Treasury Department official
in 1995 to the IRS about an examination of a tax-exempt
organization. The committee concluded that the contact had not
influenced the outcome of the case.
</P>
<P>
   But most of the attention Thursday was focused on the calls
between Gore's office and the IRS, which congressional aides said
took place on Jan. 28, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Paull said a junior staff member in Gore's office had called the
Treasury and then the IRS in search of the information about the
tax case involving the union.
</P>
<P>
   After the staff member was rebuffed, Paull said, a more senior
staff member called the IRS that same day, and was told that the
tax agency could not provide any information about specific cases
and could only discuss the issue in general terms.
</P>
<P>
   Paull said the issue had to do with whether a group of people
working for a union should be classified as employees or
independent contractors for tax purposes. The report did not
identify the IRS official who spoke to Gore's aides or the
official's title.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional aides who were briefed on the report said
documents kept by the IRS quoted the Gore aides as saying they
needed the information because Gore was to meet with the union's
president the following day.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's office said the staff members referred to by Paull were
Kumiki Gibson, who in early 1997 was Gore's counsel, and Joe Eyer,
who was an assistant to Gore's deputy chief of staff. Gibson did
not return a phone call. Eyer declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Committee investigators incorrectly described Eyer as Gibson's
superior, and said Eyer had called the IRS after Gibson had no luck
getting the information she was seeking.
</P>
<P>
   White House policy requires any contacts with the IRS to be
cleared with the White House counsel's office. Quinn said that as
Gore's counsel, Gibson satisfied that requirement, and that Eyer
had told the vice president's office that his practice was to clear
such calls with the counsel.

 &HT;    Complaints about census problems beginning to add up
 &HT;    By Rhonda Cook
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Glitches with census forms and phone lines are causing
confusion for some metro Atlantans.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is weird,'' said Marlene Elkins of Marietta. ``I got two
forms. ... This is supposed to be an accurate count? They can't
even get this right.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Bureau of the Census officials in Atlanta and Washington
admit there have been some problems as the 2000 count begins.
</P>
<P>
   ``People should not lose their confidence'' in the accuracy of
the census, said Paul Wyatt, a spokesman with the bureau in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``These things should be put into perspective,'' he said.
``These are not things that are widespread as far as we know. And
they are correctable.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, the census missed 1.6 percent of the nation's people
and 2.2 percent in Georgia _ more than 142,500 people. Heavy
emphasis has been placed this year on getting an accurate count.
</P>
<P>
   Results determine where political boundaries are drawn, how many
representatives each state has in Congress, as well as how federal
money for transportation, education, social service programs and
community block grants is distributed.
</P>
<P>
   Several problems have popped up. Some residents, including
Elkins, received more than one form.
</P>
<P>
   There was an extra digit (the number 1) at the beginning of
addresses on letters sent about two weeks ago announcing that
census forms would be mailed soon.
</P>
<P>
   Those announcement letters also included a return envelope, but
no explanation for it in English. The explanation for the envelope,
to send for a form in another language, was on the back of the
letter and in Spanish, Chinese, Korean, Tagalog and Vietnamese.
</P>
<P>
   Some people have received cards thanking them for returning
their census questionnaires, even though they had yet to receive
the forms.
</P>
<P>
   Others are finding it time-consuming and cumbersome to call the
bureau's helpline (800-471-9424). Often, the line rings many times
before it is picked up and by someone who may or may not know the
answer to the question.
</P>
<P>
   Elkins said she had called the number to find out what to do
with the second census form, especially since she already had
returned the first one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went through menu after menu after menu and then it rang and
rang and then he (the operator taking the call) had to look (the
answer) up,'' she said. ``They weren't the least bit alarmed I got
two. Talk about a black hole.''
</P>
<P>
   The census is the nation's second-largest undertaking, ranking
only behind mobilization for a full-scale war. It will cost about
$6.5 billion and will employ about 500,000 workers, most of them
temporary employees, at its peak between the end of April and the
first week of July. ``The downside is, and what is very upsetting
is, it does in some way lower the faith some people have in the
process,'' Linda Meggars, director of the state's congressional and
legislative reapportionment office, said of the glitches. ``It
shouldn't. They need to keep in mind how big this process is.''

CENSUS BUREAU ROLE REPORTED IN INTERNMENT OF JAPANESE-AMERICANS 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Replace double parentheses with brackets in penultimate
graf.) 
(DW) 
 By STEVEN A. HOLMES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two scholars say in a new research paper that
despite earlier denials, the Census Bureau was deeply involved in
the roundup and internment of Japanese-Americans at the onset of
U.S. entry into World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The academics say the Census Bureau's involvement included
identifying concentrations of people of Japanese ancestry in
geographic units as small as city blocks, lending a senior Census
Bureau official to work with the War Department on the relocation
program and a willingness to disclose names and address of
Japanese-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   While it is common today for the Census Bureau to publish
reports that detail the number of people of a given race living in
an area as small as a city block, such information was generally
not available in the 1940s. But the authors of the paper contend
that the Census Bureau provided such detailed information as well
as age, sex, citizenship and country of birth to the War
Department, now the Defense Department, on only one group _
Japanese-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   In 1941 and '42, the paper says, Census Bureau officials
believed that such information was valuable to the War Department's
effort in rounding up residents of Japanese ancestry.
</P>
<P>
   The paper, ``After Pearl Harbor: The Proper Role of Population
Data Systems in Time of War,'' was written by William Seltzer, a
statistician and demographer at Fordham University, and Margo
Anderson, a history professor at the University of Wisconsin in
Milwaukee whose area of expertise is the census.
</P>
<P>
   Seltzer and Anderson plan to present the paper at the annual
meeting of the Population Association of America next week in Los
Angeles. Copies of the paper have been circulating in Washington,
and one was made available to The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   The practices described in the paper did not appear to have
violated laws governing the census, which prohibit the bureau from
disclosing census information on individuals. But the authors
indicated that despite the law, Census Bureau officials appeared to
be willing to provide such data. What is not clear is whether they
were asked to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're by law required to keep confidential information by
individuals,'' the paper quotes the director of the Census Bureau,
J.C. Capt, as saying at a meeting of the Census Advisory Committee
in January 1942. But if the defense authorities found 200
Japanese-Americans missing and they wanted the names of the
Japanese-Americans in that area, Capt said, ``I would give them
further means of checking individuals.''
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau often boasted that its conduct in the
relocation of Japanese-Americans had been its finest hour because
it resisted pressure to provide explicit data to the War and
Justice Departments.
</P>
<P>
   But Census Bureau officials do not dispute the findings of the
paper. They say, however, that the strengthening of the laws
protecting the confidentiality of data on individuals and the
environment today would make a repeat of those abuses unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese-Americans have long suspected that the Census Bureau
played a prominent role in the roundup and relocation of 120,000
residents of Japanese ancestry, most from the West Coast, to
detention camps in the interior.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always suspected this,'' said Norman Mineta, a former
California Congressman who was relocated with his family from San
Jose to a detention camp in Wyoming. ``After all, they are the
keeper of this kind of information. I was a little over 10 years
old when all this happened. I remember years later becoming aware
of the fact that this kind of information could not have come from
any other source than the Census Bureau.''
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 9, 1941, two days after the attack on Pearl Harbor, the
Census Bureau produced a report titled, ``Japanese Population of
the United States, Its Territories and Possessions.'' The next day
the bureau issued a report on the Japanese population by
citizenship and place of birth in selected cities across the
country. The next day it published another report, this one on the
Japanese population by counties in states on the West Coast. All
reports were based on data from the 1940 census.
</P>
<P>
   Capt, the Census Bureau director, justified the speed with which
the bureau produced these reports by saying at meeting of the
Census Advisory Committee in January 1942: ``We didn't want to wait
for the declaration of war. On Monday morning we put our people to
work on the Japanese thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States declared war on Japan that Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Subsequent reports became even more detailed. In 1942, Tom
Clark, a Justice Department official working with the War
Department, was quoted in the paper as saying that Census Bureau
officials would ``lay out on tables ((maps of)) various city blocks
where Japanese lived and they would tell me how many were living in
each block.''
</P>
<P>
   The paper's disclosures come at a ticklish time for the Census
Bureau because they coincide with the mailing this month of census
forms to about 120 million households. Bureau officials say they
fear that the scholars' paper may frighten people into not
returning the forms.

INDEPENDENT COUNSEL SEES NO CRIMINAL WRONGDOING OVER FBI FILES

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Nearly four years after the office of independent
counsel began investigating how the White House acquired some 900
confidential FBI files, many of them of prominent Republicans, the
current head of the office, Robert Ray, officially reported on
Thursday that no criminal wrongdoing was involved.
</P>
<P>
   The report is the first of several to be issued over the next
several months by Ray as he closes down the independent counsel's
office that has been investigating a wide range of issues involving
President and Mrs. Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement released at the same time he filed the report at
the federal courthouse here, Ray said:
</P>
<P>
   ``In the FBI files matter, the Independent Counsel determined
there was no substantial and credible evidence that any senior
White House official, or First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, was
involved in seeking confidential Federal Bureau of Investigation
background reports of former White House staff from the prior
administrations of President Bush and President Reagan.''
</P>
<P>
   The report itself was filed under seal and was not released
publicly, under procedures established under the independent
counsel law that give those named in the report a chance to
respond. Lawyers familiar with its contents said that it concluded
that the files were inadvertently collected at the White House
through a series of errors committed by mid-level officials in the
White House security office.
</P>
<P>
   The report also definitively clears Bernard Nussbaum, a former
White House counsel, of any wrongdoing in connection with a
peripheral matter involving the White House files.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition of the FBI files led to wide criticism of the
Clinton White House for its apparent carelessness in handling
sensitive personnel files. More troublesome was a broad range of
speculation that the files were collected purposely in order to
collect political intelligence on prominent Republicans. Some of
the files requested and received by the Clinton White House were
those of Brent Scowcroft, President George Bush's national security
adviser; Kenneth Duberstein, President Ronald Reagan's chief of
staff, and Marlin Fitzwater, press secretary to both Reagan and
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation included fingerprint analyses of the files
themselves to see if any senior Clinton officials or the first lady
had handled them. Those tests produced no evidence that the files
were read by senior officials or Mrs. Clinton, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   The report concluded that the files were improperly collected
because a mid-level investigator, Anthony Marceca, requisitioned
them from the FBI using an outdated list compiled by the Secret
Service of who had passes to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Some senior Clinton associates on Thursday said they were
pleased about the findings and sought to portray them as evidence
that justified their complaints that enormous time and money has
been wasted in the investigation which started with the Clinton's
investment in the Whitewater real estate venture and expanded to
many other areas. The investigation, which has lasted more than
five years, is estimated to have cost more than $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   The only public statement the White House offered on Thursday
was given by Jim Kennedy, a spokesman, who said that the Ray
statement, ``confirms what Mr. Starr said two years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ray's office is planning to file other reports in the coming
months. The next report due about July will deal with how White
House officials fired seven longtime employees of the White House
travel office and planned to replace them with longtime associates
of the Clintons. That report may be more problematic for the
Clintons as it will likely explore Mrs. Clinton's role in the
dismissals. She has insisted to investigators she was only slightly
aware of what was happening while others have testified that she
was at the center of it.
</P>
<P>
   In his statement on Thursday, Ray struck a different tone than
his predecessor, Kenneth W. Starr who had deeply strained relations
with the White House. Ray made a point of thanking the White House
for its cooperation in the investigation of the FBI files.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Under the independent counsel law, the reports are filed with a
special three-judge panel that administers the law. Although the
law expired in June, its provisions still govern Ray's operation.
</P>
<P>
   The three-judge panel is supposed to allow persons named in the
report to see it to allow them to rebut or respond to it. After
that, a process that could take as long as three months, the
reports may then be released publicly.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   More than a third of the 100-page report that was filed today is
devoted to the Nussbaum investigation which had come to symbolize
for many in the Clinton White House, the quickness with which
Attorney General Janet Reno had once sought to turn minor
allegations into full-blown independent counsel investigations.
</P>
<P>
   Reno had asked the independent counsel's office, then under the
direction of Starr, to investigate whether Nussbaum had testified
untruthfully before Congress. A House committee investigating the
acquisition of the files wanted to determine who had hired Craig
Livingstone, who was in charge of the office when the files were
collected.
</P>
<P>
   In testimony before the committee, Nussbaum denied that he had
ever told an FBI agent that Livingstone was hired because either he
or his mother were friends with Mrs. Clinton. The agent, Dennis
Sculimbrene, had produced handwritten notes of his interview saying
that Nussbaum attributed Livingstone's hiring to an association
with Mrs. Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials were angered that Reno sought an
independent counsel to investigate Nussbaum as many argued that the
case was always flimsy as it involved two different accounts of a
meeting, Nussbaum's and Sculimbrene's. In the end, the report is
unequivocal in its conclusions that there is no case against
Nussbaum, lawyers familiar with it said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ray said in his statement that, ``The independent counsel found
no substantial evidence that Nussbaum lied to the House Committee
on Government Reform and Oversight about his discussions with Mrs.
Clinton regarding the hiring of former Office of Personnel Security
Director Craig Livingstone or about his knowledge regarding the
circumstances of Mr. Livingstone's appointment.'' Ray added that
there was no evidence that Mrs. Clinton was involved in the
Livingstone hiring in any way.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ARTYOM, Russia _ The most autocratic governor on Russia's
Pacific Rim received a particularly warm birthday greeting in
February: heads of the regional press gathered to give him a cake
in the shape of his fief and offered up a specially composed ditty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dear Volodya, what a friend, your opposition is at the end,''
the editors congratulated Yevgeny Nazdratenko, the governor of the
Primorye, or Maritime, region.
</P>
<P>
   These days, that kind of press praise for the men who rule
Russia's regions is hardly unique. From Pskov on Russia's western
border to here, on its eastern frontier, Russia's regional
newspapers are increasingly under the thumb of local authorities.
</P>
<P>
   This has not escaped the attention of Acting President Vladimir
Putin, a passionate advocate of building a strong federal state in
a Russia whose vast and distant lands have slipped from the
near-ironclad authority that Moscow enjoyed in Soviet times.
</P>
<P>
   One of Putin's first decrees as acting president authorizes
federal subsidies to 2,500 local newspapers, including 19
provincial newspapers here in Primorye. More than $6 million in
subsidies are planned for this year.
</P>
<P>
   The president's men insist he is striking a blow for press
freedom. But critics say the unspoken agenda is to shift the
allegiance of the regional press from the regional overlords to
Putin, the overwhelming favorite to win the March 26 presidential
election.
</P>
<P>
   In Artyom, a downtrodden town with sporadic heat and no hot
water, a top editor of Vybor, a local weekly, is not troubled by
the moral debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're backing Putin,'' said Lyubov Vozian, the deputy editor
of the cash-poor paper, cheerfully. ``We want the money.''
</P>
<P>
   With its smattering of small-town news, paid political ads and
television listings, Vybor could never be mistaken for one of the
nation's leading newspapers. A six-month subscription to the
eight-page weekly costs 36 rubles (about $1.25).
</P>
<P>
   But provincial newspapers like this have become increasingly
important because they are the only publications that millions of
Russians read.
</P>
<P>
   Major national newspapers like Izvestia may influence the
chattering classes in Moscow, seven times zones west of Artyom.
Outside Moscow, many Russians consider such papers an unnecessary
luxury.
</P>
<P>
   Izvestia, for example, had a circulation of more than 6 million
when it was a propaganda organ for the Soviet state. These days,
Izvestia's circulation is 262,000. Fewer than 2,000 of those copies
are sold here in Primorye.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten years ago, most families read two, three or four
newspapers,'' said Vladimir G. Ostrovsky, the deputy editor of
Vladivostok, the region's most established local newspaper. ``Most
families now read one newspaper at most. It has to be cheap and it
has to have the television listings.''
</P>
<P>
   With major Moscow-based advertisers reluctant to include the
poorer provinces in their publicity campaigns, and with publication
costs rising steadily, the regional press has become increasingly
dependent on the good will and financial backing of local
politicians. These patrons expect a high degree of political
loyalty in return.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the Primorye region has been no easy place to
practice journalism. After a brief moment of freedom following the
collapse of the Soviet Union, Nazdratenko came to power in 1992.
Like many other regional leaders who slipped from the Kremlin's
grasp and reached various accommodations with Moscow in exchange
for local power, he turned the region into his political fief.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are really only two political parties here: the governor
and the opposition,'' said Marina Loboda, a Vladivostok-based
reporter for Moskovsky Komsomolets, the national tabloid. ``All the
other political parties live in Moscow.''
</P>
<P>
   Editors say the authorities have several ways to keep the press
in line. They can encourage Russian and foreign companies to
advertise in their favored newspapers. They can evict news
organizations from government-owned buildings or pressure private
landlords to evict troublesome news bureaus. They can file lawsuit
after lawsuit to keep the editors in court or force them to pay
fines.
</P>
<P>
   In Vladivostok, the region's main printing press is owned by the
federal government, but Nazdratenko has been lobbying hard to gain
control. Local editors say that the governor already has
considerable influence at the plant.
</P>
<P>
   ``According to government regulations, we have to have a month's
reserve of paper on hand,'' Ostrovsky said. ``But nobody can afford
to do that. So it is a lever that can be used at any time.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In extreme cases, rebellious editors or broadcasters have been
threatened or roughed up, although aides to Nazdratenko deny that
they had anything to do with such attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the press, however, needs no coercion, as Nazdratenko's
birthday bash made plain.
</P>
<P>
   After presenting the congratulatory ditty, the journalists gave
him small gifts, including a dartboard with a picture of Anatoly
Chubais, the self-styled reformer and one of the governor's
political nemeses.
</P>
<P>
   The private event was filmed by the governor's television
station, OTV PRIM, as a memento of the occasion, but a tape was
leaked to NTV, Russia's only independent television network. ``The
press really demonstrated what it has become,'' said Andrei
Kalachinsky, who runs the Vladivostok office of the National Press
Institute, a nongovernmental group that is trying to encourage a
free press. ``They came and bowed to the feet of the governor.''
</P>
<P>
   Sergei Manin, an executive at Artyom's municipal television
station, said the journalists' sentiments were heartfelt. ``The
media expressed its feelings quite sincerely,'' Manin said. ``And
the guy who leaked the tape was fired.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   As in many other regions across Russia, even those local
journalists less enamored of Nazdratenko are not always
independent. Also lacking resources to publish or broadcast, they
often receive financial support from the governor's political
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow, federal officials say the subservience of the
regional news media is a serious and growing problem. To combat it,
the Russian Press Ministry has already begun to carry out Putin's
decree authorizing subsidies, which officials say are intended to
defray printing and production costs and help the newspapers become
more profitable. The subsidies average $1,500 a month, a
considerable sum for a provincial newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want the newspapers to reflect reality and not the point of
view of a governor,'' said Vladimir V. Grigoryev, the deputy
minister of Russia's press ministry. ``This will help develop a
real media market where newspapers can be bought and sold. It will
probably help us have a freer press.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics assert that if the Russian government wanted a free
press, it would grant new tax breaks to all news media, not
distribute subsidies to a favored group.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an attempt to influence the content of newspapers and
make them more dependent on federal authorities,'' said Andrei G.
Richter, director of the Media Law and Policy Center at Moscow
University.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In Artyom, a city of 114,000 people, the editors of Vybor do not
even dream about total independence. The paper, as they see it,
needs the support of the governor to keep the city's mayor in check
and the backing of the president to counterbalance the governor. It
is a recipe for survival, not autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   But even survival is not easy. Vybor is formally owned by the
local administration, a legacy from Soviet times. The city
administration has not provided any money to the newspaper in more
than a year, and the relationship between the editors and the mayor
is sour.
</P>
<P>
   After Vybor reported about unheated apartment houses and a
paralyzing bus strike, the mayor's office demanded a letter laying
out the evidence. More worrisome, the mayor announced a plan to
take direct control of the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to survive and worried about the mayor's designs, Vybor's
editors turned to Nazdratenko, whose office already provides a
modest subsidy to the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Vybor, in turn, publishes the glowing accounts that the
governor's aides prepare about his activities. To facilitate the
process, the regional government gave Vybor a fax machine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We publish lots of news about the governor's good deeds,''
Vozian, the deputy editor, said brightly. ``He supports us.''
</P>
<P>
   But Vybor would embrace additional allies, particularly in the
Kremlin. The editors were pleased that their weekly is one of 19
provincial newspapers the Russian press ministry is planning to
support in Primorye.
</P>
<P>
   Vozian said that federal officials had promised the newspaper an
initial payment of 60,000 rubles (about $2,100) in exchange for
Vybor's support for Putin's election. The newspaper has not
received the money, but she remains hopeful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, we're supporting Putin,'' she said. ``We want to be
independent.''

   NEW DELHI, India _ Manorama Patra is worried about the
canary-yellow blooms lining the entrance to the Maurya Sheraton
hotel. The annuals are at the end of their season and she is hoping
they will hold on until Sunday when President Clinton arrives in
New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see, these flowers are at the end of their life. They are
already seeding,'' said Patra, the environmental chairwoman for the
Maurya, one of Delhi's best luxury hotels.
</P>
<P>
   Patra also has been given the task of supplying flowers for
Clinton's Maurya suite, named after a powerful fourth century Hindu
king. ``We've been told not to place flowers with a lot of
pollen,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   While Patra instructs her staff of 22 gardeners on how to spruce
up the front lawns, an even bigger staff is working around the
clock to get ready for the visit by the U.S. president, the first
since Jimmy Carter's trip in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Work crews are polishing thousands of square feet of marble
floors and cleaning wall-to-wall windows.
</P>
<P>
   When an unexpected afternoon storm descends, managers start to
panic. ``Don't just stand there. Cover the glass outside,'' one
shouts to his staff.
</P>
<P>
   The Maurya is accustomed to high-powered clientele, but the
White House has booked the entire hotel for Clinton and his
traveling staff. ``Yes, that is very unusual,'' Patra said.
</P>
<P>
   One week before the president's arrival, Secret Service
personnel and U.S. Embassy staff members were milling around the
vast halls of the Maurya and meeting with hotel managers every day.
</P>
<P>
   But security is the last thing on the minds of the Maurya's many
shopkeepers, who are eager to do a lot of business next week.
</P>
<P>
   Lucrative Commercial Private Ltd. has doubled its stock of
Indian jewelry and curios and is busy installing new track lighting
so the president and his staff can see the goods better. ``We're
expecting a big business boom,'' manager Shailesh Jain said.
</P>
<P>
   But no one is more excited about Clinton's visit than Saboor
Wangnoo and his staff at National Cottage Emporium, a Kashmiri
crafts shop. It was from Wangnoo's store that Hillary Rodham
Clinton purchased a chain-stitched rug for the White House and a
gift for the president when the first lady and daughter Chelsea
visited India in 1995. Manager Abdul Majid pulls out an album
filled with pictures of that visit that he received from the White
House. He points to framed letters written by Bill and Hillary
Clinton thanking him for the purchases. The letters are Wangnoo's
pride and joy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am really looking forward to saying hello to Mr. Clinton.
Mrs. Clinton had promised he would come into my store,'' said
Wangnoo, adding that he has saved a special rug to show the
president. The chain-stitched carpet has 1290 knots per inch and
took 2 1/2 years to make, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In between talking about the lucrative business possibilities
that are ahead for his shop, Majid is asked whether all this effort
to please the American president will help bring peace to his
war-torn homeland. The territorial dispute with rival nuclear power
Pakistan over Kashmir and other tensions are high on the Clinton
agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Majid, surrounded by his pashmina shawls and hand-woven carpets,
thinks for a moment and quietly says, ``God willing.''

<P>
   Most investors are probably unaware of one of the great unsolved
mysteries of the last decade: the breakdown of many technical
approaches to stock-picking _ strategies that had been successful
for decades.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, not all such systems stopped working in the early
'90s. After all, there are an incredibly large number of them,
since technical analysis encompasses any approach that focuses
exclusively on the price histories of stocks. But some of the
simplest, most popular varieties did fall apart.
</P>
<P>
   Among the best known is a strategy based on moving averages _
one that advises buying stocks whenever the market is trading above
its average level over the previous few weeks or months, then turns
bearish if the market starts trading below that average.
</P>
<P>
   There are many variations, depending on the period on which the
average is based. But researchers found that almost any period
between two months and a year proved equally profitable over the
long term.
</P>
<P>
   Consider how well one such strategy _ using a 150-day moving
average _ performed when applied to the Dow Jones industrials over
a very long stretch, from 1897 to 1986. According to three
professors _ William Brock of the University of Wisconsin at
Madison, Blake LeBaron of Brandeis University and Josef Lakonishok
of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign _ the system beat
a simple investment in the Dow Jones industrials by an average of 7
percentage points a year. That difference is especially striking in
that an investor using the system would have been invested in
stocks only 60 percent of the time.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1990s, by contrast, this strategy's performance was,
well, awful. For the 11 years from January 1988 through February
1999, according to recent follow-up research conducted by LeBaron,
the system lagged behind the Dow by an average of 2.3 percentage
points a year.
</P>
<P>
   Newsletters that use moving average systems have seen similar
reversals. From 1980 to 1989, for example, the market-timing advice
of the Fabian Premium Investment Resource _ which uses a 39-week
moving average and is probably the best known of the lot _ beat the
Wilshire 5000 index by 2.1 percentage points annually, on average.
From 1990 to 1999, it lagged behind the market by 3.7 percentage
points.
</P>
<P>
   But the plot thickens. Beginning in the early 1990s, the use of
technical trading systems in other kinds of markets also began to
fail. Simple moving-average strategies had also been profitable,
for example, when applied to foreign-exchange markets for the two
decades through the late 1980s. If the dollar was trading above,
say, its 30-day moving average compared with the Japanese yen, that
amounted to a buy signal. But according to LeBaron, such systems
also stopped working in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Or consider a strategy called pairs trading, which focuses on
divergences in pairs of stocks that typically move in tandem. For
at least two decades through the late 1980s, such divergences soon
reversed themselves, making it profitable to buy the stock that
underperformed its partner while shorting the other, according to
William N. Goetzmann, a finance professor at the Yale School of
Management. Starting in the early 1990s, however, the strategy
declined in profitability and then began posting frequent losses.
</P>
<P>
   A large part of the failure of such approaches likely has to do
with increasing market efficiency. Investors in the 1990s witnessed
the growth of two important forces: personal computers and discount
brokerage commissions. The PC lets individual investors learn about
and act quickly upon statistical patterns in price and volume data
_ information that previously could have been known only by large
firms with supercomputers. Cheap trading, particularly online, has
let investors exploit technical strategies far more easily.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, as more and more investors try their hands at
technical analysis, trying to take advantage of pricing anomalies,
the anomalies evaporate and the strategy loses its advantage. That
is market efficiency at work. Think about that the next time you
read about such an approach in your favorite chat room. &QL;

 BUSH TRIES TO ALLAY NEW CRITICISMS BY McCAIN SUPPORTERS  
 (bl)  
 By FRANK BRUNI and ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPRINGFIELD, Ill. _ Gov. George W. Bush went out of his way
Thursday to demonstrate respect for Sen. John McCain, pointing to
areas of agreement between him and his vanquished rival for the
Republican presidential nomination and saying, ``I'm confident we
can work together.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush made his comments during two speeches Thursday and at a
news conference here Thursday afternoon, as aides and supporters of
McCain criticized Bush for remarks in an interview with The New
York Times on Wednesday. They said the Texas governor had made it
more difficult to work out a reconciliation between the two men.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Bush said McCain had made him a better
candidate, but he also said he had no intention of making
concessions to McCain and passed up several opportunities to
embrace his signature proposal to overhaul the campaign finance
laws. Bush also challenged the notion that McCain had been
responsible for the huge surge in voter turnout during the
Republican primaries, saying, ``Well, then, how come he didn't
win?''
</P>
<P>
   Todd Harris, a spokesman for McCain said, ``Obviously we're
disappointed with the governor's tone, but it doesn't change any of
our plans. Senator McCain is committed to campaigning for
reform-minded Republicans across the country.'' He sidestepped the
question of whether McCain would ultimately endorse Bush.
</P>
<P>
   But another aide to McCain said that the interview had made an
endorsement less likely. And Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., who was a
national co-chairman of the McCain campaign, said, ``I don't think
it enhances the bridge-building that needs to be done here. That
was a pretty arrogant interview and it doesn't help what we're all
trying to do here.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, Bush's Democratic opponent in the
general election, who is trying to win over some McCain supporters,
also jumped into the fray. He chided Bush for saying that McCain
had not changed his views on reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he should have been taking notes from John McCain,''
Gore said Thursday to a gathering in Washington of about 50 members
of the Amalgamated Transit Union.
</P>
<P>
   Taking advantage of the Republican divisions, Gore cited
McCain's criticisms of Bush's proposal to cut taxes by $483 billion
over five years. Had Bush taken notes, Gore said, ``he could have
written down the statistics that John McCain pointed out _ that his
risky tax scheme gives 60 percent of all of the benefits to the
wealthiest 10 percent of the people.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In his interview, Bush called the tax cut ``a well-thought-out
plan backed by numbers backed by credible sources.'' He said he
believed voters are interested in tax relief.
</P>
<P>
   In the governor's public appearances and in a series of
telephone calls, the Bush camp made a concerted effort to try to
smooth relations with the McCain camp.
</P>
<P>
   The presumptive Republican presidential nominee brought up
McCain in a luncheon speech, saying: ``I appreciate the hard
campaign that John McCain waged. He ran a good race. He highlighted
the need for reform, and I appreciate the ideas that he brought
forth in the campaign. Of course, he and I agree on a lot, and it
starts with this: the best reform for America is to end the
Clinton-Gore era in Washington, D.C.''
</P>
<P>
   Later at a news conference Bush referred to The New York Times
article indirectly, saying, ``There's a story out today that
doesn't characterize how I feel.''
</P>
<P>
   He directed attention instead to a interview on the front page
of The Dallas Morning News quoting him as saying he wants to mend
fences with McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how I feel,'' he said holding up the Texas newspaper.
``I look forward to working with Senator McCain.'' He added that
the senator ``ran a good campaign. He brought forth some issues
that are important and I'm confident that we can work together.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted that both men, for instance, want to change the Social
Security system to allow younger workers to have personal
investment accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's aides also contacted McCain's aides and supporters. Staff
members for both men said that Joe Allbaugh, the governor's
campaign manager, called John Weaver, McCain's political director.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as we saw The New York Times story, we immediately
reached out to Senator McCain's staff and advisers to tell them
that The New York Times story was not a full and fair reflection of
what the governor has said about Senator McCain,'' said Ari
Fleischer, a spokesman for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   He said, ``We provided them with the quotes that were excluded
from the story, that were put at the bottom of the page of the
transcript, off the front page and out of the headlines.'' He said
Bush aides also told the McCain campaign about The Dallas Morning
News interview.
</P>
<P>
   The question of how to handle McCain has been a sensitive one
for Bush because even while the Arizona senator lost popularity
among Republicans, he attracted to his side many independent and
swing voters who could well determine which party wins the November
election.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Both Bush and Gore are already casting themselves as reformers
and vying for the allegiance of McCain;'s followers.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the two men's agendas are difficult to reconcile. McCain is
particularly focused on winning a ban on the unlimited, unregulated
donations to political parties known as soft money. Yet Bush has
stopped short of endorsing such a ban and many of his staunchest
allies adamantly oppose such legislation, arguing that it would
hamper the ability of Republicans and conservatives to fight for
their causes.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who is on vacation in the South Pacific, pulled out of
the Republican race last week but stopped short of endorsing Bush
after their bitter primary struggle. He vowed to keep up a battle
for his issue agenda, ranging from overhauling the campaign finance
law to mixing moderate tax cuts with debt reduction.
</P>
<P>
   McCain made no statement himself on Bush's remarks, but Hagel
said, ``I can guarantee that he knows about it. Right next to that
grass hut, he's got his fax machine winging along.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., who supported McCain, also was critical
of Bush on Thursday, saying, ``either he's arrogant or he's
politically tone deaf.''
</P>
<P>
   Aides to the Arizona senator revealed this week that he is
creating his own political action committee to help him keep up a
national political presence and keep his supporters mobilized. They
said McCain planned to campaign in November for candidates who
share his views and that he also planned to stump for a ban on
unlimited unregulated donations to political parties.
</P>
<P>
   Among the activities tentatively in the planning stages, aides,
said, is a a tour of college campuses where McCain would hold the
kind of town hall meetings he popularized in New Hampshire.

GORE RIDICULES BUSH'S ECONOMIC PLAN AS `ECONOMIC SNAKE OIL' 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also BUSH-MCCAIN and GUNS-LAPIERRE) 
(sw) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Wasting no time in sharpening his knives against
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, Vice President Al Gore on Thursday
ridiculed Bush for proposing an economic plan laced with ``economic
snake oil,'' a plan with a tax cut that Gore said was so reckless
even the Republicans in Congress had better sense than consider it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush's tax scheme is so risky, so reckless, that just
yesterday the Republican-controlled House of Representatives, given
an opportunity to vote for it, turned it down, turned the other
way, said we don't want to even cast a vote on that thing,'' Gore
said. ``They came up with some gyrations to avoid having to vote on
it.''
</P>
<P>
   In a day of campaigning around Washington, Gore also escalated
the administration's battle with the National Rifle Association and
what he described as the Republican ``lackeys'' in Congress who do
its bidding. In a speech to the Consumer Federation of America _ an
event that his office billed as official rather than political
because Gore had been invited in his capacity as vice president _
Gore raised the issue of gun control.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to earlier comments by Wayne LaPierre, the executive
director of the association, that President Clinton and Gore were
willing to accept a certain level of killing to further their
political agenda, Gore said, ``Those kind of comments are shameful
and they're wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Noting that the Republican leadership had refused for eight
months to allow a conference committee between the House and Senate
to meet to discuss the gun-control measures in the two chambers'
separate juvenile crime bills, Gore added: ``What we don't need is
more violent rhetoric from those whose policies do nothing to stop
gun violence and indeed are designed to paralyze efforts such as
those as would take place in this conference committee if the NRA
would allow its legislative lackeys to meet, to permit the
conference to meet.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore also leaped at the opportunity on Tuesday to ridicule Bush
for failing to heed any lessons from Sen. John McCain, who has
suspended his presidential campaign against Bush.
</P>
<P>
   In an appearance before about 50 members of the Amalgamated
Transit Union, Gore cited a Bush interview and said of him, ``he
even said in this morning's New York Times that he didn't learn a
thing from John McCain in the Republican primaries and wasn't going
to change anything whatsoever in an effort to reach out to McCain
or to accommodate whatever he could have learned from John
McCain.''

 By JAMES DAO and MARC LACEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A growing number of prominent Republican officials
say they feel deeply uncomfortable with the harsh battle of words
pitting President Clinton against the National Rifle Association,
and, as a result, have begun urging passage of long-stalled
gun-control legislation in Congress this year.
</P>
<P>
   A number of Republicans who have strongly opposed strict
gun-control efforts in the past _ including Rep. J.C. Watts of
Oklahoma, who has appeared in ads for the National Rifle
Association, and Rep. Sue Kelly of New York _ have joined the call
for Congress to move on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   But there were no signs Thursday that either those efforts or
the statements this week by two leading Republican governors,
George W. Bush of Texas and George Pataki of New York, supporting
some gun-control measures were having any effect on Republicans who
control the fate of the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, aides to Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, chairman of the
Judiciary Committee, and Rep. Tom DeLay of Texas, the House
majority whip, accused Democrats of playing politics with the
issue, adding that they saw no reason at present to move the
bottled-up bill.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the rifle association also said Thursday that they
had no plans to tone down their attacks on Clinton. They said the
fierce back-and-forth has resulted in a surge in the organization's
membership.
</P>
<P>
   ``Folks have been saying outrageous things about NRA members for
years,'' said a spokesman, Bill Powers. ``People say we're an evil
empire, and they don't bat an eye. We view this as an opportunity
to point out what we truly believe. If it requires some degree of
provocativeness, the issue is important enough for that.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the association's executive vice president, Wayne
LaPierre, said that Clinton had blood ``on his hands'' for
advocating new gun restrictions instead of enforcing existing laws.
</P>
<P>
   He suggested that the president bore responsibility for the
shooting death of the former basketball coach of Northwestern
University, Ricky Byrdsong, who was killed last year with an gun
purchased from an unlicensed gun dealer.
</P>
<P>
   A White House spokesman, Joe Lockhart, called LaPierre's
comments ``sick rhetoric.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Just when you think a human being couldn't go any lower, Wayne
LaPierre and the NRA found a way yesterday by saying that the blood
of Ricky Byrdsong is on the president's hands,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, a number of Republican officials who have been
allies with the rifle association distanced themselves from
LaPierre's remarks, including Bush, the Republican's presumptive
nominee for president.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a way to debate the issue without casting aspersions
on the president like this,'' Bush said at a news conference
Thursday in Springfield, Ill. ``I think they've gone too far with
that statement.''
</P>
<P>
   Several leading Republicans in Congress also expressed dismay
with the intensity of the attacks between Clinton and the NRA. But
while they stopped short of condemning LaPierre, those Republicans
said they have begun urging their leadership to move forward with
negotiations on the stalled gun-control bill, which includes
provision requiring trigger locks on new guns and background checks
for people who buy firearms at gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   A Democratic version of the gun-show bill passed in the Senate
last year as part of a broader juvenile justice bill. But the House
passed its juvenile justice bill without any gun-control
provisions. The differences must now be resolved by a joint
House-Senate conference committee, which has met only once since
last summer.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has called on Congress to pass gun-control
legislation before April 20, the one-year anniversary of the
shootings at Columbine High School outside Denver.
</P>
<P>
   ``The clock is ticking, and America is waiting to see whether
Congress can really produce a bill that responds to the interests
of our children and not the intimidation of the NRA,'' he said
Thursday at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Watts, the House conference chairman, the No. 4 post in the
Republican leadership, said through a spokesman that he opposed the
gun measures backed by Clinton but agreed with him that the
conference committee should convene.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like for the viciousness to stop on both sides,'' said
Watts spokesman Bill Shapard. ``We want to talk about issues. We
think we will win the battle in conference.''
</P>
<P>
   Watts was one of more than 40 Republicans who voted for a
non-binding resolution on Wednesday urging the House-Senator
negotiators to meet.

</P>
<P>
   Kelly, who has voted with the House Republican leadership
against gun-control bills in the past, also voted for the
resolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's safe to say that there is a lot of rhetoric on both sides
that we can do without,'' said Rob Ostrander, Kelly's spokesman.
``But the bottom line is, she feels that that should be set aside,
and that a middle ground can be found.''
</P>
<P>
   Although it will take considerable movement for legislation to
emerge from a conference committee, some lawmakers said they
believed a compromise could be reached.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a former judge that used to bring parties together in
settlement conferences, I'd say we're kind of close on this, and we
ought to be able to resolve it,'' said Rep. James Rogan, R-Calif.
``Why is there the vitriolic name-calling and bloody shirt-waving
on both sides?''
</P>
<P>
   The advisory resolution that passed the House on Wednesday took
no position on gun control. It merely urged conferees to meet
within the next two weeks to discuss the gun legislation. But the
NRA opposed the measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no reason to force a deadline other than to allow
political grandstanding on issues that members are already trying
to resolve in good faith,'' the gun association said in a memo
circulated among lawmakers before the vote.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations have stalled over details of the measure. The House
Democratic leadership supports a version giving law enforcement
officials three business days to complete a background check; many
House Republicans support a 24-hour limit on such checks.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic officials asserted that Wednesday's non-binding vote
showed that Republicans are feeling pressure to enact some gun
legislation this year, whether to answer concerns from their own
constituencies or to help insulate Bush from charges that he is
beholden to the rifle association.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that that at least some Republicans feel that allowing
the gun lobby to determine the congressional schedule is too great
a burden for them to carry,'' said Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont,
the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans said the vote was meaningless, and they accused
the House Democratic leader, Rep. Dick Gephardt of Missouri, of
playing politics with the gun-show bill. They asserted that
Gephardt does not want any bill to pass so that the Democrats can
hammer Republicans with the issue in the fall elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gephardt has laid down the gauntlet,'' said Tony Rudy, a
spokesman for Rep. Tom Delay, the Republican whip. ``He's saying
there's no room for compromise. What he wants us to do is come out
with a bill that won't pass.''

</P>
<P>
   Investors bought stocks furiously, sending the Dow Jones
industrial average up nearly 500 points in its biggest one-day
point gain ever. Broader indexes also rose sharply as investors _
at least for the day _ put aside fears that the Federal Reserve
will aggressively raise interest rates and slow the economy to a
crawl. The Dow gained 499.19 points, or nearly 5 percent, to
10,630.60. The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index ended three
days of sharp losses with a gain of 134.77 points, or nearly 3
percent, to 4,717.39. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index rose
66.32 points, or 4.8 percent, to 1,458.47.

 BUCHANAN WRAPS HIMSELF IN McCAIN'S FLAG OF REFORM  
(sw) 
 By FRANCIS X. CLINES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ Grafting onto the lesson of the presidential
primary contests, Pat Buchanan on Thursday unveiled a retooled
stump speech for his lagging third-party candidacy, packing this
year's politically magic phrase ``campaign reform'' into its every
jot and tittle.
</P>
<P>
   Conceding the losing insurgent effort of Sen. John McCain had
made campaign reform ``the only real issue'' in this presidential
year, Buchanan tailored his remarks to that cause as he took his
quest for the Reform Party nomination to Harvard University and
accused the two major parties of huge fund-raising abuses in ``an
incumbents protection racket.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Both Beltway parties are chemically dependent on soft money,''
Buchanan told an overflow crowd of more than 300 at the John F.
Kennedy School of Government in a speech starkly different from the
``pitchfork brigade'' orations of past campaigns. ``We get no soft
money and we take no PAC money.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither Beltway party is going to drain this swamp: it's a
protected wetland; they breed in it, they spawn in it,'' Buchanan
added, sparking general laughter and applause. He even updated his
stump graphics with a giant mock check at his side made out for
hundreds of millions of dollars to the major parties and endorsed
by ``Influence Peddlers.''
</P>
<P>
   With his candidacy in the doldrums for months, Buchanan, a
turncoat Republican, clearly sought to tap into the public appetite
for the campaign reform issue that McCain galvanized in his losing
challenge to Gov. George W. Bush for the Republican nomination.
</P>
<P>
   But during Buchanan's one-hour appearance, students accused him
of exploiting some controversial racial and political views in his
chronic presidential candidacy. One student accused him of
``selling out'' his one political virtue, consistency, in jumping
to the Reform line. Another, identifying himself as a rare
conservative Republican at the Kennedy school, caustically
declared, ``Thank you for leaving the party.''
</P>
<P>
   But Buchanan gave as good as he got, at one point defending his
controversial accusation that Harvard employs elitist quotas
favoring groups like Jewish- and Asian-American students at the
expense of the nation's white Christian majority.
</P>
<P>
   ``Simply because you're at Harvard does not exempt you from the
same kind of rules and regulations that Harvard lovingly imposes
upon the rest of America,'' he shot back at one critic. ``Pat
Buchanan is not a beloved figure in America, but neither is
Harvard.''
</P>
<P>
   To another questioner, Buchanan conceded the ``risk'' that he
might ultimately succeed only in playing the spoiler's role and
drain enough votes from the Republican line to help Vice President
Al Gore be elected. In the view of some political specialists,
Buchanan's current standing of about 6 percent in the polls might
be enough in a close race to foil Bush. The Reform line created by
Ross Perot drew 19 percent of the vote in 1992 and saw President
George Bush defeated by Bill Clinton by a plurality.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his remarks, Buchanan made clear his determination to
stay in the race and fight for an equal spotlight in this fall's
televised presidential debates. He said he expected the major
parties to try to block this and that he was preparing a lawsuit to
challenge for debating time if, as he expects, he wins the Reform
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have ruined the conservative cause,'' he declared in
criticizing current Republican leaders and rebutting a questioner
who called him ``a reactionary in reformer's clothing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For the last seven years they conflated the conservative cause
with Clinton bashing,'' Buchanan said.
</P>
<P>
   Framing his speech as a detailed cry for reform, Buchanan called
for a ban on soft money and the creation of a national initiative
and referendum process to let voters directly change the system. He
also urged the imposition of term limits on Congress, a body he
described as so beholden to big-money donors that it has become the
nation's ``bellhop stand for the business roundtable.''
</P>
<P>
   In sum, Buchanan packed the Kennedy school forum with the same
heady mix of political iconoclasm and personal controversy that was
his stump signature in 1992 and 1996, when he drew early primary
support but failed to win the Republican nomination. His quest this
time, in which he has said he will fight Perot if the Texas
billionaire runs again, is complicated by the need to build
political organizations in most of the 29 states where the Reform
party does not exist.
</P>
<P>
   Students questioned how the Reform party, which in the past
shied from social and cultural issues, might ever embrace Buchanan,
whose opposition to abortion has been his political keystone. The
candidate replied that he had not altered his views but, rather
than feature them in the Reform platform, he would ``append'' them
to the platform as a personal statement.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan drew strong applause at the close of a performance in
which he handled even a lampoon touch when a young man beamed and
asked him out on a date.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shelly, would it be okay?'' Buchanan asked, turning to his
wife with a big grin. Then the candidate guffawed as he told the
audience, ``She said it would be okay!''

A NEW ACTIVIST FUND WILL TEST WEB'S CLOUT

<TEXT>
<P>
   Could this be the face of 21st-century shareholder activism?
</P>
<P>
   A new small-cap mutual fund, Allied Owners Action Fund,
introduced on March 10, together with a companion Web site, will
soon be making their pitch to rally shareholders and other
investors against what they believe to be corporate greed and
ineptitude.
</P>
<P>
   Allied Owners is your standard small-cap stock mutual fund with
a twist _ it will invest in companies that it asserts will benefit
from activist input. The Web site, eRaider.com, will solicit
discussion from investors, and perhaps drum up a target company or
two. Though distinct entities, both are run by Privateer Asset
Management, a New York money management firm.
</P>
<P>
   Privateer's plan goes like this: the fund will seek out and
invest in target companies and the Web site will alert independent
investors and shareholders, so that they can invest in the same
companies independently. If all goes well, these allies will
pressure corporate boards accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   Privateer plans to post its first list of target companies on
eRaider in the next eight weeks.
</P>
<P>
   If the whole swashbuckling project seems ``outre'', consider the
co-founder: Martin Stoller, 44, a professor at Northwestern
University's Kellogg School of Management, who is credited by
activists with igniting the first Web-based shareholder revolt last
year.
</P>
<P>
   His target then was United Companies Financial, a subprime
lender based in Baton Rouge, La. Stoller posted messages on a Yahoo
bulletin board and forged an Internet shareholder alliance against
United Companies' management.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance he formed won unheard of clout in United Companies'
bankruptcy proceedings and Stoller has led the shareholder's equity
committee, which is now formulating a reorganization plan for the
company.
</P>
<P>
   He said the experience gave him the idea of organizing small
shareholders on a grander scale to target badly-run companies _ and
doing so early enough to avoid what happened with United Companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I was trying to do was figure out how to harness the
special qualities of the Internet to address the very special
problems of shareholders,'' Stoller said.
</P>
<P>
   The fund and eRaider.com will be run as separate companies.
Allied Owners has just $1.1 million in seed money _ most of it from
Stoller himself. It plans to focus on companies with lax management
and underperforming assets.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, the fund will search out companies that tend to
escape Wall Street attention _ those with no analyst coverage,
little institutional ownership and market capitalizations under
$500 million. At least for now, the fund will take less than a 5
percent stake in target companies.
</P>
<P>
   For investors who want to participate in this kind of risky
shareholder activism, the minimum investment is $2,500. The fund
expects an expense ratio of about 1 percent. Privateer will absorb
any legal expenses from lawsuits filed by target companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking for companies that could use a little extra
push, a little outside help,'' said Aaron Brown, 43, a finance
professor at Yeshiva University in Manhattan, the other co-founder
of Allied Owners and president of Privateer. He is upfront in
describing an investment in Allied Owners as a gamble, and said
people who were not ready to risk their money should hold off
several years before buying into the fund.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the flamboyant rhetoric about pirates and raids, both
professors said the fund was not targeting companies for takeover.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, their aim will be to organize a large block of a
company's shareholders _ 25 percent to 40 percent _ and to fill
Internet message boards with criticisms that supporters hope will
eventually nudge management to do whatever is needed to increase
shareholder value. A proxy fight is always an option.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will have a shadow board of directors on the Internet,''
said Brown, who manages $24 million in assets for private
individuals, including Stoller. Brown's wife, Deborah Pastor, 42,
is the fund's trader and portfolio manager. Brown said he would be
responsible for picking the companies the fund invests in.
</P>
<P>
   The eRaider Web site, emblazoned with cannon and sabres, is
something else. There's none of the legal-speak of the securities
industry. And 36 paid bulletin-board moderators will soon be
encouraging input from the public about the companies the fund is
invested in.
</P>
<P>
   At least initially Privateer will count on word of mouth and the
array of stock chatrooms on the Web to recruit shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Stoller made his fortune in a software and dating service
business, Plextel Telecommunications, which was later sold to
Cendant for $60 million. He says the fund and Web site will both
strive for transparency in their dealings with corporations,
allowing individuals to directly monitor developments.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he revels in eRaider's buccaneering, revolutionary image.
``We are as close to the Weathermen as you're going to get in the
financial world,'' he said, referring to the radical underground
organization.
</P>
<P>
   Other activists are starting to use the Internet. Nell Minnow, a
veteran shareholder activist with Lens Asset Management of
Washington, is taking her well-known corporate governance campaign
online with TheCorporateLibrary.com.
</P>
<P>
   She called the start of the eRaider venture a ``seismic
development.''
</P>
<P>
   Others are a bit more cautious. ``There's no way to tell right
now how many shareholder eyeballs they're going to get,'' said
Stephen Davis, president of Davis Global Advisors, a money
management firm. ``But the more shareholders they get, the more
influence they'll be able to wield at companies.''

IT'S THAT TIME OF YEAR FOR BAFFLING UCONN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BIRMINGHAM, Ala. _ The Connecticut Huskies suffer from an
identity crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The defending national champions began this season as the
country's consensus No. 1. The Huskies won 10 of their first 11
games and sent Duke and Arizona to the canvas in the process, but
``we were a team still trying to find itself,'' coach Jim Calhoun
said.
</P>
<P>
   That search continues, four months later.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really hasn't been a difficult team to coach,'' said
Calhoun, whose fifth-seeded Huskies (24-9) will oppose 12th-seeded
Utah State (28-5) at 1:50 p.m. Friday at Birmingham-Jefferson Civic
Center in the NCAA South Region.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just been difficult to convince them that what you are is
really good. Accept that. Don't fight to be something you were. Try
to be what you are. That's been our biggest fight all year.''
</P>
<P>
   That conflict could be near an end.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have the type of all-star season that everyone
thought we were going to have or the type of season that we had
last year,'' point guard Khalid El-Amin said. ``We didn't have one
of those seasons this year. We've at times had to grind out wins,
and sometimes we've gotten beaten in games that we shouldn't have
gotten beaten.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the thing about this team now is it really knows
about this tournament, knows what to do and knows how to win. So, I
feel very good about this team and its chances.''
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies built much-needed momentum for their title defense
with victories in six of their final seven games. St. John's
supplied the lone blemish with an 80-70 victory Saturday during the
Big East Conference championship game, but it appears Connecticut
now realizes that it is the ``defending'' national champion and not
``the'' national champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we could be and maybe will be as good as last year's
team if we play to our strengths as opposed to try to be something
we were,'' Calhoun said. ``Please don't think I don't believe we're
a good team. I think we're a very good team.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1998-99 Huskies went beyond being very good with 34
victories and a national title with Richard Hamilton, Ricky Moore
and Rashamel Jones supplying the firepower and will.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, those Huskies struggled, too, Calhoun said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just didn't notice last year when we struggled a little
bit in February because we were so good,'' Calhoun said. ``This
year when we didn't play quite as well or those (other) teams
played well, we didn't quite get it done.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is why the Huskies lost nine times this season and is
``very underrated,'' El-Amin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to get beat in order for us not to be the defending
national champions, and I feel like this team really knows how to
win _ especially at this time of year,'' El-Amin said. ``This is
the time of year that really counts the most. So, I do feel like
we're the defending national champions. We just have to go out and
play like it.'' nn

BMW WILL SHED ROVER, SELLING SPORT UTILITY VEHICLE LINE TO FORD 
</HEADLINE>
  (with ROVER-OUTLOOK) 
(bl) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS with ROBYN MEREDITH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ Six years and nearly $6 billion after
buying the Rover Group, BMW of Germany abandoned the British
automaker Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   BMW essentially gave Rover's money-losing car business to a
little-known group of British investors. And it negotiated a deal
to sell the Land Rover line of sport utility vehicles to Ford Motor
Co. for just under $3 billion, an executive involved in the
transaction said.
</P>
<P>
   The giveaway of Rover's car business was stunning enough. But
the Land Rover deal with Ford, which BMW is expected to announce
Friday, raised speculation about BMW's future strategy. Friday's
moves by BMW represented a retreat from a strategy of getting
bigger and broader, at a time when worldwide rivals are merging and
forming alliances.
</P>
<P>
   The ownership upheavals came as a shock to Rover's 30,000
workers in Britain as well as to the British government, which has
been hoping to salvage one of Rover's main factories with a
taxpayer subsidy around $220 million.
</P>
<P>
   BMW of Munich bought Rover in 1994 in hopes of expanding beyond
its market for luxury vehicles and of keeping up with larger
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's action represented a reversal for BMW and it
generated more uncertainty for Rover's workers, whose new boss will
be Alchemy Partners, an investor group that includes a former Rover
executive, Kevin Morley.
</P>
<P>
   Because nearly half of BMW's shares are controlled by the Quandt
family of Germany, which has so far rejected all overtures, BMW's
independence seems assured for now. But analysts say the pressures
are increasing. Volvo of Sweden sold its car business last year to
Ford. Earlier this week, the Agnelli family of Italy agreed to sell
20 percent of Fiat to General Motors.
</P>
<P>
   Though BMW did not disclose the terms, Alchemy Partners is
expected to pay little, if any, money up front and BMW will assume
many of Rover's debts.
</P>
<P>
   BMW said the expense of shedding the Rover car business would
cost about 3.15 billion euros, or $3.06 billion. As a result, it
will report an annual loss of about $2.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   BMW was officially silent Thursday on the future of Land Rover,
the profitable and growing sport utility business. An agreement to
sell Land Rover to Ford was expected to be announced Friday at the
Munich corporate headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   The jettisoning of Rover came as a relief to BMW investors, who
have viewed the British car line as a black hole for money. Rover
lost more than $1 billion in 1998 and $1.2 billion in 1999. Its car
sales plunged 24.9 percent last year, to 251,000 vehicles from
334,000 in 1998.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In further fallout from the Rover developments, BMW dismissed
three top executives, the second big boardroom shake-up in 13
months. The three executives, responsible respectively for
marketing, production, and research and development, had been named
to the board in February 1999 and were supposed to oversee the
integration of Rover and BMW.
</P>
<P>
   Joachim Millberg, who became chief executive after the ouster
last year of Bernd Pischetsrieder, appears to have been the main
architect of Thursday's moves and will remain.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Reitman, an automobile analyst in London with Merrill
Lynch, said Thursday that BMW's future would be brighter now that
it had freed itself from Rover. ``It has a massive effect on BMW,
in the sense that it removes a significant problem,'' Reitman said.
But he added, ``What it doesn't answer is the issue they themselves
have been talking about _ the need for scale.''
</P>
<P>
   Excluding Rover, BMW's profit margins are the highest of any car
manufacturer in the world except for Porsche. Reitman estimated
BMW's profit margin at 12 or 13 percent, when calculated on
American rather than German accounting standards. By contrast, he
said, the Mercedes business of DaimlerChrysler has a margin around
8.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But BMW faces assaults in the luxury market from the likes of
the Audi unit of Volkswagen AG, Volvo and the Jaguar division of
Ford, and of course, its principal German rival, DaimlerChrysler.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts are skeptical that sheer size is the basis of
success. But large size can make it easier to distribute research
and development costs over more vehicles and achieve economies of
scale.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal announced Thursday, Alchemy Partners will take
over Rover's money-losing line of midpriced sedans, including the
more expensive Rover 75, and it will acquire Rover's big factory at
Longbridge, near Birmingham, which has been in danger of closing
for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of trying to build smaller cars through Rover, BMW will
revive a strategy it discarded years ago and design a new line of
cheaper cars under the BMW brand. That is a reversal: BMW
executives had argued strenuously that they did not want ``to
stretch'' their prized brand with cars that sold too cheap.
</P>
<P>
   In an odd twist, BMW indicated that it would also give Alchemy
Partners the line of Mini subcompacts produced by Rover. Yet it
said it would retain the redesigned ``new Mini'' that is due out
later this year.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear exactly what will happen to Rover, but there were
signs Thursday that it would disappear as a brand name. In a
statement Thursday, Alchemy Partners said it would reintroduce
Rover as the MG Car Co. _ adopting the MG marque acquired years ago
by British Leyland, which owned Rover then.
</P>
<P>
   Under BMW's previous chief executive, Pischetsrieder, the
company committed itself to becoming bigger and capable of
competing in the largest and fastest-growing segment of the market
_ medium-priced mass-market cars.
</P>
<P>
   But the plan turned disastrous. The rising value of the British
pound, in relation to the falling euro, made British cars expensive
in Continental Europe and open to competition from companies like
Volkswagen and General Motors' Opel subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   Rover also failed to reduce its costs and the size of its labor
force. On top of all that, its midsize car models, the R-25 and
R-45, suffered declining popularity.
</P>
<P>
   Though many experts said the sale of Rover was overdue, some
analysts contend that BMW and the Quandt family were so concerned
with protecting their independence that they missed opportunities.
``It is the Quandts' biggest mistake,'' said Markus Pluemer, an
analyst with WestLB Research in Duesseldorf. Pluemer argued that
BMW could have rescued Rover by teaming up with a bigger
manufacturer like Volkswagen or General Motors.
</P>
<P>
   ``GM or Ford would have been willing to pay an enormous premium
for Rover,'' he said. Had BMW been willing to trade off 20 percent
of its shares, he continued, it could have preserved its
independence, raised billions in extra capital and tapped the
expertise of companies already making mass-market cars.
</P>
<P>
   Georg Stuerzer, an analyst at Hypovereinsbank in Munich, said
BMW could navigate on its own. Noting that shares of
DaimlerChrysler have plunged in the last year, Stuerzer argued that
BMW might have been well advised to focus on luxury cars. ``The
experience of Porsche gives us an indication,'' he said. ``If size
were indicative of operating margins, then Porsche should have the
lowest margins in the industry. But it has the highest.''

DEVILS SOLD FOR $175 MILLION TO YANKEENETS' UNIT
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   John McMullen's reign as the owner of the New Jersey Devils
ended Thursday with the sale of his team to a YankeeNets' affiliate
for $175 million, a nearly sixfold gain on the $30 million he paid
for the erstwhile Colorado Rockies 18 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, which is set to close in July, includes a $1 million
bonus if the Devils win the Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition of the Devils was a crucial component in the
YankeeNets' plan to build a $295 million arena in downtown Newark
and provides additional programming for the company's proposed
regional cable sports and entertainment channel.
</P>
<P>
   The sale of the Devils leaves the Islanders and Mets as the only
local professional teams that are the subject of sales
negotiations. The Yankees and Nets merged late last year. Robert
Wood Johnson IV paid $635 million for the Jets in January.
</P>
<P>
   Cablevision remains interested in adding the Mets to its
portfolio, with the Knicks and Rangers, but talks have slowed to a
crawl. And the proposed $180 million sale of the Islanders is
stalled.
</P>
<P>
   The push to buy the Devils began soon after the Yankees-Nets
merger. The new entity, known as the YankeeNets, offered $175
million, and McMullen did not argue with its generosity.
</P>
<P>
   The definitive agreement signed Thursday was technically with
Puck Holdings, whose principal investors are Raymond Chambers and
Lewis Katz of Nets Holdings. The Nets paid $225 million to become
equal partners in YankeeNets. Chambers and Katz sit on the
YankeeNets board.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're fronting the purchase and starting the process of
bringing in other investors,'' Harvey Schiller, chairman of the
YankeeNets, said. ``Then the intent is to bring the YankeeNets in
as general partner. But right now there is no liability on the
YankeeNets' side.''
</P>
<P>
   Chambers and Katz are making the initial payments because of the
Devils' important role in building the Newark arena _ and because
the YankeeNets raised their debt load by $200 million last week
with a sale of junk bonds.
</P>
<P>
   With two teams, the Nets and Devils, playing at least 82 dates
per season, bank financing for a new arena would be easier and the
chances of profitability would increase.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Christie Whitman has said that state aid of about $75
million for infrastructure needed to build a new arena hinged on
the presence of two teams.
</P>
<P>
   Pete McDonough, a spokesman for Whitman, said that ``now that
the Devils and Nets are joined at the hip,'' any threat of either
team leaving New Jersey is gone and that the location they choose
for a new arena would carry a lot of weight. But he cautioned that
any state assistance would go toward bricks and mortar, ``not to
underwrite the purchase price of the two franchises.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Sharpe James of Newark said, ``We owe it to these two
teams to give them the financial support they need.''
</P>
<P>
   Meeting Whitman's mandate for two teams in a new arena doomed
McMullen's dream of building an arena for the Devils in Hoboken.
Last month, Whitman told McMullen that she would not grant him and
his partner, Cablevision Systems, the air rights to build a
proposed arena over New Jersey Transit tracks in Hoboken.
</P>
<P>
   McMullen said Whitman's lack of support for his plan made
selling the Devils unavoidable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's terrible,'' he said. ``This is the 19th season. We built
an outstanding franchise for the state of New Jersey and it's so
disappointing not to be appreciated. I was offering to build an
arena without using any taxpayer money. The governor disappointed
me.''
</P>
<P>
   McMullen signed a 12-year lease in 1995 to keep the Devils at
Continental Airlines Arena, rather than move to Nashville. But he
said, ``Under the lease, there's no future. Our costs aren't going
down.''
</P>
<P>
   Schiller said one of his short-term goals is to negotiate better
terms on the Devils' and Nets' leases in the Meadowlands. The
Devils' lease expires after the 2006-07 season. The Nets' lease
ends in 2008, but they can move without penalty after the 2003-04
season.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Dan Emmer, a spokesman for the New Jersey Sports and Exposition
Authority, would not discuss a possible renegotiation. But he said
he hoped the YankeeNets would be persuaded to stay in the
Meadowlands at a proposed new arena south of Giants Stadium,
instead of moving to Newark.
</P>
<P>
   The purchase puts in doubt the future of Lou Lamoriello, the
Devils' president and general manager. One of the most respected
general managers in hockey, he has fashioned successful teams
without bankrupting McMullen.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a free agent,'' McMullen said. ``He's never had a
contract.''
</P>
<P>
   Schiller said there had not been any discussions with
Lamoriello. But he added, ``Our interest is to do what we can to
keep him on board.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``Lou's done a great job. He's sitting there with
salaries that are 50 percent lower than other teams. He's got a
great scouting staff and he's done it very efficiently.'' The
Devils' player payroll is $37.6 million, compared to the Rangers'
$61.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   McMullen said Lamoriello owns less than the 20 percent of the
team he has been reported to hold. ``He's in the same category with
my children, so he shares equally with them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lamoriello did not want to discuss his plans. ``I will sit down
and talk with the new owners at their discretion,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he would consider running the Rangers, he said,
``That's the first time I heard that. I have no comments on
anything of that nature right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The amassing of three teams is part of the YankeeNets' plan to
build a regional cable network with Cablevision, Time Warner or
other possible partners. The cable broadcasts of all three teams'
games are on Cablevision-run affiliates: the Yankees on the MSG
Network, the Devils and the Nets on Fox Sports New York.
</P>
<P>
   If the YankeeNets create a network with Cablevision, all three
teams could be on the outlet before their existing deals expire.
</P>
<P>
   But if the YankeeNets form a network with another partner, a
three-team channel would take longer to assemble. The Yankees'
cable deal ends after this season, the Nets' in 2002 and the
Devils' in 2007.
</P>
<P>
   McMullen has a history with the Yankees, one that produced a
memorable and frequently quoted line. He was once a small investor
in the Yankees, but the 81-year-old former Navy commander and
shipping magnate became frustrated in a supporting role to George
Steinbrenner, the principal owner. ``There's nothing more
limited,'' he said, ``than a limited partner of the Yankees.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, when he signed a lease with an escape clause if the
Yankees moved to New Jersey, he said, ``I'll do everything I
possibly can, within the agreement, to keep the Yankees from coming
to New Jersey.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees did not come to New Jersey. But the YankeeNets did.
And McMullen's team will soon belong, in part, to George
Steinbrenner.

BUCHANAN SAYS HE'LL BE ON THE BALLOT IN NOVEMBER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By YVONNE ABRAHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The smoke from the Democratic and Republican
nominations battles is clearing. The presumptive nominees, Vice
President Al Gore and Texas Governor George W. Bush, are loading
their canons and training them on each other.
</P>
<P>
   Not so fast, says Pat Buchanan, the erstwhile GOP stalwart who
jumped to the Reform Party last fall, and is seeking the party's
presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to students at Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of
Government Thursday, Buchanan made it clear that he intends to turn
the two-man race for the presidency into a three-way fight. He
attacked both nominees, and both parties, in a speech entitled ``A
Plague on Both Your Houses.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither candidate is committed to cleaning up the current system
of campaign financing, Buchanan said, a system that was ``pretty
much the only real issue'' in this year's presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Friends, neither Beltway party is going to drain this swamp,
because to them it is not a swamp at all, but a protected wetland,
and their natural habitat'' he said, to laughter. ``They swim in
it, feed in it, spawn in it.''
</P>
<P>
   But few students were interested in talking about Buchanan's
ideas for campaign finance reform. Instead, questioner after
questioner took issue with his socially conservative stances, his
statements on Adolf Hitler, the innate unsuitability of women to
the trading floor, and his contention that Harvard seems to
discriminate against Catholics and fundamentalists.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan returned the acrimony, at one point admonishing the
college for using double standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Simply because you're at Harvard does not exempt you from the
same kinds of rules and regulations Harvard lovingly imposes upon
the rest of America,'' he said. ``And maybe you ought to examine
your own consciences, instead of constantly telling the rest of
America what they ought to do. Pat Buchanan may not be a beloved
figure in America, but neither is Harvard.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan, a former aide to Presidents Richard Nixon and Ronald
Reagan, has twice before run for president. Last fall, lost in a
crowded Republican field, he switched to the Reform Party which,
led by Ross Perot, garnered 19 percent of the vote in the 1992
general election.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Perot's credibility has dropped, and the party has
fallen into disarray, a status intensified by the recent departure
of Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura.
</P>
<P>
   The party is not yet on the ballot in 29 states, and Buchanan is
trying to gather petitions to change that. But he has shown the
ability to surmount tough odds in the past: In 1996, he won the
Republican contest in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   According to Buchanan, Senator John McCain owed this year's
great success in the Granite State partly to Buchanan's supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``McCain got 40 percent of the Buchanan vote in New Hampshire,
based on the fact that he was standing up and defying the
Washington establishment,'' said Buchanan. ``A lot of Americans
looked up to and supported McCain because he represented a
challenge to the two-party system in Washington, he was something
different.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan is hoping that revulsion at what he called the
``Republicrat collusion'' will draw voters to him in November.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP, he said, ``is dead, and its successor on Capitol Hill
has become little more than the bellhop stand of the Business
Roundtable.''
</P>
<P>
   He proposed an end to campaign contributions by unions and
corporations, and full disclosure of contributions within 48 hours
of receipt. He proposed that half of all contributions to members
of the House and Senate should come from their home states or
districts. He called for term limits and increased contribution
limits, to be set at $3,000 instead of $1,000 and indexed to
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan would not, however, put an end to advertising by
special-interest groups like the National Right to Life Association
or the Sierra Club, as long as their affiliations are disclosed.
Such advocacy advertisements are free speech, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan did allow that leaving the Republican Party had been a
difficult decision for him, and he worried that he might be doing
harm to the principles he holds dear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I prayed over it,'' he said. ``And I know that there is a
possibility that my campaign might damage and set back the causes
I've fought for my whole life.''
</P>
<P>
   But, in the end, Buchanan said he had obligations to his
supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason I ran against (Bush) is this,'' he said. ``I came
to the conclusion that Al Gore is going to beat him, and we are
going to go down in defeat a third time. And people who believe in
me as a leader, and who believe in all the causes I believe in,
(were) going to go unrepresented in the general election.''

AFTER VICTORIES, BUSH MUST WIN OVER THOSE WHO SEE HIM AS WEAKENED 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also BUSH-MCCAIN) 
(sw) 
 By ADAM CLYMER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, far from being
weakened by a tough primary season, was fortunate to have some
inevitable problems disclosed sooner rather than later, in the view
of Republicans who wish him well.
</P>
<P>
   But the issue now is whether Bush will be able to profit from
the opportunity to prove he is ready for the fall campaign. Some
governors before him, including Jimmy Carter and Michael Dukakis
overcame both real difficulties and Washington mockery, and then
behaved as though that proved they knew everything they needed to
know about politics.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's intermittently dismissive tone toward Sen. John McCain in
an interview on Wednesday suggested he has at least a mild dose of
that nomination hubris. But the actions of aides reaching out to
various Washington Republicans suggest a far more unifying
approach.
</P>
<P>
   Winning over McCain, and especially his followers, is only one
of the issues that Bush faces after his victories on Tuesday, when
he came well within range of having the delegates to be nominated.
</P>
<P>
   But many in the capital who once assumed his nomination and
election to be foreordained seem to see Bush's experiences in the
primaries only as problems and to conclude that the primaries
weakened Bush and strengthened Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   On one dimension, it is obviously true. Polls that showed Bush
with leads of up to 20 percentage points over Gore last fall now
show them more or less even. Some have Gore slightly ahead.
</P>
<P>
   And Gore is plainly stronger, having slimmed his campaign,
stayed on message with mind-numbing persistence and worked hard to
win every primary and caucus, defeating both Bill Bradley and
Washington's image of him as a loser.
</P>
<P>
   But the part about Bush's being weaker depends, beyond the
numbers, on some pretty facile arguments. They go this way: that
the primaries hurt Bush by opening up divisions in the Republican
Party, tying him to its right wing, denting his shiny image and
exposing him, in the word of one Gore enthusiast, as an uninformed
and inarticulate ``stumblebum.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe.
</P>
<P>
   But maybe not.
</P>
<P>
   For example, it is clear that Bush does not have a glass jaw.
John McCain knocked him down in New Hampshire, he battered McCain
in South Carolina, then McCain slammed him in Michigan. Then Bush
won the nomination, coast to coast, on the first two Tuesdays of
March.
</P>
<P>
   If Bush had won as easily as many had expected, he would still
have been vulnerable as a candidate who was anointed by
fellow-governors and members of Congress, and then, after winning
last summer's checkbook primary, was handed the nomination. In
reality, Bush fought hard, perhaps even dirty, but got nothing on a
silver platter.
</P>
<P>
   One serious problem the primaries revealed was Bush's need, in
the words of Stuart Spencer, a veteran Republican consultant, to
``get a little more savvy on some of the issues.'' Publicly, some
Bush aides dismiss this problem as one that only reporters care
about, citing a recent Gallup Poll in which 70 percent of the
public (compared with 77 percent for Gore) said he had enough
knowledge to be president.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to imagine that the problem would have cured itself,
and the jokes from Jay Leno and David Letterman would have
disappeared if only John McCain had not been around. And the first
debate with Gore would be a poor occasion for Bush to reveal that
he did not know the name of the prime minister of Canada, or that
he wanted to ``use our technologies to enhance uncertainties
abroad.'' Or, as an advocate of improved education, to observe,
``Rarely is the question asked: Is our children learning?''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever Bush and his handlers say, they now have several months
to train their candidate to avoid seeming ignorant or stupid.
</P>
<P>
   Two developments in the primaries that are widely described as
Bush setbacks were his visit to Bob Jones University and his
reliance on the help of Pat Robertson. Gore partisans chortle that
it will now be easy for them to portray Bush as a tool of the
religious right. (Not that they weren't planning to do so anyway.)
</P>
<P>
   It is an opening, to be sure. But its effectiveness will depend
on what Bush seems like in the fall; in short, on whether he can
recapture the compassionate image that was his initial emphasis in
the race. Ralph Reed, a major Bush backer, argues that polls show
that Bush is still ``viewed as a new and different kind of
Republican.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, when Bush defended Robertson and Jerry Falwell against
McCain's attacks, he gave the Christian conservatives a reason to
vote for him. He had their leaders' endorsements early on, but
there had been serious doubts about whether he could get the rank
and file. He got them.
</P>
<P>
   As Reed said, ``In what you expect to be a very close election,
the first thing you want is to unify your party and insure that
your base is intact.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, of course, the task is to reach out _ as Bush promised when
he started his campaign. He and his staff know it, and know they
have been diverted by the necessities of winning primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, identifying problems is not solving them. Bush's
verbal difficulties may be incurable.
</P>
<P>
   And on reaching out, there will probably be some heavy-handed,
unconvincing ``Democrats for Bush'' events. On other issues, it is
not clear that the Bush campaign has avoided that pride that has
often infected primary winners.
</P>
<P>
   But some of his perceived wounds are not real, and none are
mortal, whatever the latest public opinion surveys say. It is a
mistake, after all, to lean too much on the world of polls whose
basic question begins with a condition contrary to fact: ``If the
election were held today.''
</P>
<P>
   Those polls, nearly eight months ahead of reality, imply that if
one candidate, like Gore, gets better, Bush must be getting worse.
Both candidates can improve, or get worse, at the same time. Or one
can improve, or get worse, more than the other.
</P>
<P>
   Not until Election Day will the campaign be a zero-sum game.

MCCAIN PROMISES FIGHT OVER CONVENTION DELEGATES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn.: Mich.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TINA CASSIDY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   John McCain may have lost the war, but he doesn't want to lose
this battle.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign sources say the Arizona senator may decide to withhold
an endorsement of George W. Bush if the Texas governor tries to
replace McCain delegates with his own supporters at the Republican
National Convention this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Although it may seem like little more than a parliamentary
issue, having loyal delegates at the Philadelphia convention is a
matter of necessity and pride for McCain, who is still reeling from
the string of primary losses that ended his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   By having supporters fill the 239 delegate slots he won, McCain
could use his convention soldiers for one last stand: To influence
platform issues such as campaign finance reform, which would
require holding one-fourth of the 110 delegates on the resolutions
committee, or to suspend convention rules, for which he needs only
a majority of delegates from five states.
</P>
<P>
   The delegate issue is greatest for McCain in Massachusetts and
Michigan, where Republican Party leaders are moving to have Bush
backers fill the delegate seats, jeopardizing whatever
insurrections the senator wants to stage on the convention floor.
</P>
<P>
   Both states choose delegates to the convention from an open pool
of Republicans, which would make it easy for Bush supporters to
become McCain delegates.
</P>
<P>
   ``If George Bush is going to let the governors continue to put a
further strain on an already difficult relationship, then they're
making a major mistake,'' said McCain's Northeast campaign
director, Michael Dennehy.
</P>
<P>
   One campaign source stressed that the flap over delegates could
push McCain toward withholding an endorsement or other public
support for Bush, who could need his former rival's moderate base
of support to win the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has racked up 1,093 delegates, enough to clinch the GOP
nomination. McCain won primaries in Arizona, Michigan, New
Hampshire, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Vermont,
for a total of 239 delegates, all of whom would be required to vote
for the senator during the convention's first ballot, even if they
personally support Bush.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not the point, the McCain campaign contends.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Bush people want to continue trying to steal our state
delegates, then certainly, we're going to fight for them,'' Dennehy
said. ``It would not help with any type of support at all . . . And
in many of these states, there's been a mandate for John McCain.
And to simply ignore that mandate and try and use the establishment
to push through Bush supporters is an insult to the people of
Massachusetts, the rest of New England, and Michigan.''
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire chose their delegates, loyal to McCain, right
after the Feb. 1 primary. Delegate selection rules in Rhode Island
and Connecticut are more favorable toward McCain, who can submit a
slate he desires in those states. Also, the McCain campaign does
not believe there will be trouble with delegate selection in his
home state of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   However, in Vermont, delegates rely on the support of the party
establishment to win the seats, making it easier for Bush loyalists
to go to the convention.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's Massachusetts, where McCain won all of the
state's 37 delegates. McCain's campaign says only his backers
should fill those seats at the convention.
</P>
<P>
   But the state GOP party executive director, John Brockelman,
says Governor Paul Cellucci, an ardent Bush supporter, deserves to
be in one of the seven at-large delegate seats handed out by the
Republican State Committee. The other 30 seats will be filled
during local caucuses next month.
</P>
<P>
   Although state party rules say the winner of the primary
receives all of the 37 delegates, that's not necessarily the case
here.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have caucuses you seek to get your people elected,''
Brockelman has said, suggesting that Bush supporters could be
selected throughout the state, not just for the handpicked at-large
delegate seats.
</P>
<P>
   Brockelman scoffed at the remarks from the McCain campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is stealing any delegates,'' he said. ``The delegate
rules are very clear. Any Republican in the state can run for a
delegate slot.''
</P>
<P>
   In Michigan, which has 58 delegates, some of McCain's slots
``may be up for grabs,'' said John Truscott, a spokesman for
Governor John Engler.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say once again John McCain is complaining about rules
that were in place and is trying to get them changed to suit his
own purpose,'' he added.

ROVER DEAL REFLECTS DWINDLING BRITISH BRANDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (with BMW-ROVER)  
(bl) 
 By ALAN COWELL with ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   LONDON _ For decades now, the British automotive industry has
been a story of British ownership dwindling as foreigners snapped
up the marques from the proudest Jaguars and Bentleys to the
humblest Mini. Thursday, there were a few extra twists, most
remarkably that a British venture capital company might be paid to
take over this country's most troubled auto plant.
</P>
<P>
   BMW AG, the German automaker that bought Rover Group for $1.2
billion six years ago and has plowed billions more into it since,
moved Thursday to end a disastrous investment that has turned into
a sinkhole.
</P>
<P>
   Rover's money-losing Longbridge plant outside Birmingham in
central England is to be acquired by a British venture capital
company, Alchemy Partners. Rover's sport utility vehicle division
is expected to be purchased by Ford Motor Co.
</P>
<P>
   The twist in the interlocked deal, according to an executive who
knows its broad outlines, was that BMW was ready to ``gift-wrap''
the disposal of the Longbridge plant. Alchemy Partners is pressing
for BMW to pay it up to $1 billion in net assets and a cash
sweetener to take the plant, free of debt.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Alchemy Partners, founded only three years ago by
the British venture capitalist Jon Moulton, has $1.6 billion in
assets under management on behalf of 35 institutional investors
including Goldman, Sachs and Bank of America, a spokesman for the
company said.
</P>
<P>
   Those funds will be directed in part at reducing Longbridge's
work force and possibly disposing of part of the sprawling plant
that German newspapers call ``The English Patient'' because of its
losses and low productivity.
</P>
<P>
   At present, the plant manufactures small and medium-size Rover
25 and 45 models along with a version of the Mini that was set for
replacement. But, within the next few years, Longbridge's run of
mass-market autos bearing the Rover name will end, to be replaced
by what the new owners Thursday called ``a more focused'' plant
manufacturing sporty MG compacts intended to appeal to young
families, as MG itself produced in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to reduce the cost base to a level where the
company generates cash rather than eats it,'' Moulton said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   If that turns a profit, Alchemy will look for the exits,
according to Moulton, who told reporters his investment would span
three to six years. Those exits could include a merger with another
company, a sale or a stock flotation.
</P>
<P>
   The Alchemy spokesman indicated, however, that the new owners of
Longbridge had no plans to spend the kind of money usually
associated with new car models, saying the MG successors to Rovers
would need only ``tens of millions of dollars'' to develop. That
suggested that the staff reductions at Longbridge, which employs
9,000 of Rover's 30,000 people, could be even more severe than
analysts had anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   The looming cuts have angered the government, which stands to be
accused by the opposition Conservatives and by its own supporters
of failing to secure the long-term viability of Longbridge as a
provider of jobs both at the plantt and throughout the West
Midlands region, which is dependent on the automaking industry.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Byers, the trade and industry minister, assailed BMW on
Thursday night, accusing the German company of reneging on a
commitment to maintain its investment in Longbridge in return for
more flexible working hours from auto workers and in return for the
British government's pledge to support the plant with an aid
package.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a real body blow for the people who work at Longbridge
and the people of the West Midlands,'' Byers said. Graffiti sprayed
on the plant tonight accused the German company of betrayal.
</P>
<P>
   Rover will join a tally of names like Morris, Austin, Sunbeam
and Riley winnowed over the years from Britain's showrooms. It is
the end of a long story. Once the chariot of choice for
middle-class Britons eager for leather seats and walnut dashboards
_ but not quite able to afford a Jaguar _ Rover has more recently
been the underdog of the British car market and a sinkhole for BMW
investments totaling $3.4 billion since it bought the group for
$1.2 billion six years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Its owners and partners have included the British government,
British Aerospace and Honda prior to BMW. Its cars have
consistently failed to overcome the twin burdens of a strong pound,
which made Rover's exports too expensive for foreign buyers while
permitting its European rivals to import their cars into Britain
more cheaply. And BMW's $1.2 billion of losses at Rover last year
finally annulled a partnership that had once been described as the
biggest and most promising of foreign investments in British
industry.
</P>
<P>
   In extricating itself from a mess that drew in British
politicians and European regulators, BMW could barely have brought
together two more unlikely entities. Alchemy is regarded as a
fast-moving, aggressive firm that sees its niche as taking losers
and turning them into winners. It took its name to make the point.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now it's a case of proving the meaning of their name,'' said
Stephen Reitman, an auto industry analyst with Merrill Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   Moulton, 49, established the company after a long career in
venture capital with firms that included Citicorp and Schroder
Venture. He has been involved in many deals, such as one that
rescued the Parker Pen company and made millions. Since its
founding, Alchemy has been linked to deals on Scottish hotels and
Britain's largest cattle-breeding concern. But it has never been
directly involved in the car business or in a deal of this
magnitude with so much capital and jobs at stake.
</P>
<P>
   Alchemy, said a spokesman for the company, plans to bring in a
management team with automotive expertise to replace the current
top management dominated by BMW executives.
</P>
<P>
   For all that, Longbridge's stubborn labor unions and political
sensitivities, its age as one of Britain's oldest auto plants
dating to 1906, and its persistent productivity problems may be
difficult to turn around. Additionally, with the pound still
strong, the new managers will face some of the same problems as BMW
did.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the day,'' said Reitman at Merrill Lynch, ``the
thing that strikes me is that the things that conspired against BMW
aren't going to go away.''

JOHNSON TRIES TO REASSURE MILLS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VERO BEACH, Fla. - In an attempt to ease Alan Mills' mind,
manager Davey Johnson told the right-handed relief pitcher that the
Dodgers weren't going to trade him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him, `First of all I enjoyed having you pitch for me
the last few years. I love you, man, but you're not going
anywhere,' '' Johnson said. ``And I didn't mean `Yet.'''
</P>
<P>
   It's Johnson's way of settling down a potential distraction.
Since the end of last season Mills has been mentioned in trade
speculation for the past six months, and that figured to intensify
after right-hander Mike Fetters pitched later in the day against
the Mets. The Dodgers' bullpen is already crowded with right-handed
set-up men, and Fetters' return further complicates the issue.
</P>
<P>
   But Johnson elected to talk to Mills after he threw only a
bullpen after making Wednesday's road trip.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson explained that he wanted Mills to get his work in, and
that Mills would pitch two or three innings today. Mills admitted
the talk with Johnson eased his mind, but he didn't want to speak
in depth about it.
</P>
<P>
   Several Dodgers officials said they thought the consistent trade
talk bothered Mills, though minimally. He is 0-1 with a 7.20 ERA
this spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``My job is to make (the available players) fit into 25 men to
give me coverage in any area I need,'' Johnson said. ``That is my
job, to have them play to the best of my ability. I don't trade
them. I may recommend, but I don't trade them.''
</P>
<P>
   That job belongs to general manager Kevin Malone, who figures to
do something before the Dodgers break camp. The Dodgers plan to
carry 11 pitchers, though that can change quickly.
</P>
<P>
   After the starting five, it leaves Jeff Shaw, Terry Adams, Gregg
Olson, Mills, Onan Masaoka and Fetters. Orel Hershiser could be the
fifth starter if Carlos Perez continues to falter. Otherwise, he'll
be in the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   But there's also the issue of adding a left-hander to the
bullpen. The Dodgers have Masaoka, but Johnson prefers two, so Jeff
Williams is also getting a look.
</P>
<P>
   Fetters feels fine: The answer as to whether Fetters could cover
first base unfolded on his first pitch of spring training. David
Lamb grounded to F.P. Santangelo at second and Fetters had to cover
first. He did it with no problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he's right, he's filthy,'' Johnson said. ``When he's
throwing the ball with that sink, he gets a lot of ground balls and
doesn't get in much trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Fetters threw 10 pitches in a perfect inning, and afterward said
it's the best he's felt in years.
</P>
<P>
   ``My location was good, arm felt strong, and now it's all about
the leg,'' Fetters said. ``I think I've proven to the guys upstairs
my arm is sound and I'm ready to pitch again. I feel about as good
as I've felt in my career.''
</P>
<P>
   Perez's preference: The Dodgers rotation could take a decided
shape today. Perez and Hershiser are scheduled to pitch, and
Johnson said he will continue with five starters (rather than the
six he's been using) for the rest of the Grapefruit League. That
could spell trouble for Perez, who has a 14.40 ERA in his first two
outings. Johnson said he wants to see progress from Perez.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what they have in mind, but I want to be there,''
Perez said. ``No matter if they use me as fourth, fifth in the
rotation, I want to be there ... I'm not going to be happy if they
make me go (to Triple-A Albuquerque). Maybe we can do something
else. I'm not going to be happy, and I don't want to go back.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Nicole Menz, assistant state attorney of Indian River
County (Fla.), said she will decide today whether to file charges
against Perez, who was arrested on suspicion of driving under the
influence of alcohol late Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will talk to the arresting officers (today) and then make a
decision,'' Menz said. ``He'll probably be charged.''
</P>
<P>
   Perez's arraignment is set for April 18 in Indian River County
Court.
</P>
<P>
   Odds and ends: Right-hander Antonio Osuna, coming off elbow
surgery, threw breaking pitches on the side for the first time and
said he experienced no pain. However, Osuna said it's doubtful
he'll pitch in a spring training game ... right-hander Gregg Olson,
bothered by a sore elbow, pitched for the first time since March 7.
He allowed one run in one inning ... Rick DeHart, one of three
left- handed relievers still in camp, is out indefinitely with a
sprained ligament in his elbow.
</P>
<P>
   DODGERS vs. ST. LOUIS
</P>
<P>
   When/Where: 10:05 a.m., Holman Stadium, Vero Beach, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Radio: XTRA 1150 AM (tape delayed at 5:30 p.m.)
</P>
<P>
   Today's game: It's a huge day for Dodgers left-hander Carlos
Perez as he tries to remain in the hunt for a starting spot. Perez,
who has a 14.40 ERA after two spring outings, will be followed by
right-hander Orel Hershiser against the Cardinals. Hershiser is the
Dodgers' next option if Perez doesn't make the staff. Right-hander
Darryl Kile pitches for St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's result: The Dodgers hit five homers, including the
first of the spring by Shawn Green, in a 9-3 win against the Mets.
Devon White, F. P. Santangelo, Paul LoDuca and Angel Pena also
homered. The Dodgers are 3-12-1.

PENTAGON BALKS AT ADDING KOSOVO BATTALION 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also KOSOVO) 
(js) 
 By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The top NATO commander, Gen. Wesley Clark, wants
the United States to commit an additional battalion of 700 to 800
soldiers for Kosovo to prevent Albanians from raiding across the
border into Serbia, but the Pentagon has balked at the idea, NATO
and U.S. officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing an erosion of security in Kosovo, Clark has pressed the
NATO allies to increase forces. This week, France and Italy pledged
to add 1,100 soldiers to their forces. Thursday, the NATO secretary
general, George Robertson, said the allies would add troops, if
necessary, to deal with eruptions of violence.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials, however, remain wary of committing more U.S.
troops to the 5,300 there, the officials said. Senior commanders
have asked Clark to provide a more detailed analysis to justify the
need for the added battalion, a process that could take days, a
NATO official said.
</P>
<P>
   Clark's request reflects his continuing differences with senior
Pentagon officials over running an operation that has increasingly
struggled to contain clashes between the Serbs and Albanians in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   As violence has flared in the ethnically divided town of
Kosovska-Mitrovica and along Kosovo's southeastern border with
Serbia, Clark has argued for a stronger response from the 33,000
troops on the ground there. On Wednesday, U.S. soldiers raided
villages in southeastern Kosovo, seizing weapons and ammunition
that were evidently being used by Albanian fighters to strike at
Serbs across the border.
</P>
<P>
   Clark requested the added troops this week, the officials said.
One Pentagon official said Clark had not made a formal request.
</P>
<P>
   Clark wants the battalion to increase patrols along the
Kosovo-Serbia border, according to the other officials. He also
requested _ and received approval for _ 50 Army troops to operate a
Hunter unmanned aerial surveillance drone, presumably from
neighboring Macedonia, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Clark's demands for more aggressive action, however, have met
resistance in Washington. When he first asked for up to 1,800
additional NATO troops last month, Pentagon officials said the
European allies should contribute more first.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon announced Thursday that it was sending 1,100
marines to Kosovo for a two-week exercise that will involve 2,000
allied troops. The marines, now on landing ships in the
Mediterranean, are to land in Greece this weekend before moving
overland through Macedonia and into Kosovo. They are widely
expected to stay until the first week of April.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials insisted that the exercise had been planned
months ago and was not related to the Kosovo tensions. But the
aides acknowledged that the rapid deployment of 2,000 troops, part
of the reserve for NATO operations in Kosovo, could demonstrate a
resolve to maintain a secure environment and improve the ability
for rapid reinforcements.

MINE SAFETY CHIEF VOWS ACTION OVER ASBESTOS DISCLOSURES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANDREW SCHNEIDER  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Davitt McAteer agonizes over how the federal
government's mine-safety agency failed to prevent hundreds of slow,
painful asbestos-related deaths.
</P>
<P>
   McAteer is not an outside critic. He is the boss of the Mine
Safety and Health Administration, and he backs up his anguish with
a vow: ``I will make damn sure that it doesn't happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   He has launched an aggressive examination of all the mines
across the nation that may be contaminated with asbestos.
</P>
<P>
   An investigation by the Seattle Post-Intelligencer into the
lethal legacy of a vermiculite mine owned by W.R. Grace &AMP; Co. in
Libby, Mont., moved McAteer to search his agency's archives.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper documented that almost 200 miners and members of
their families had died from diseases caused by exposure to
tremolite asbestos fibers, and hundreds more got fatal diseases _
asbestosis, lung cancer and mesothelioma _ from the mine's
asbestos-tainted ore.
</P>
<P>
   The P-I also reported that for decades, government agencies knew
the workers and their families were at risk, but did nothing to
stop it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a hard time believing what I was reading,'' McAteer
says. ``So I had all the reports pulled on Libby and found out it
was true. What I found bothered me a great deal. We could have done
more. We should have done more and we didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   His agency, a branch of the Department of Labor, ``failed to
detect, failed to alert, and failed to remedy the situation,'' he
says. ``We can't bring those people back, but we can make changes
in how we operate so we don't have any revelation of preventable
deaths 20 years from now. I want to ensure that this is not still
happening today in any of the mines we're responsible for.''
</P>
<P>
   A remarkable admission
</P>
<P>
   It's extraordinary when a boss of a federal agency admits that
lives could have been saved if the government had done a better
job. There's a lot that's extraordinary about McAteer.
</P>
<P>
   He came into government from the coal fields of West Virginia,
after founding and directing the Occupational Safety and Health Law
Center and working as the Solicitor for Safety for the United Mine
Workers. Before taking over as its chief, he was one of MSHA's
fiercest critics.
</P>
<P>
   Union leaders and newspapers in mining country cheered President
Clinton's appointment of McAteer in 1994 as mine-safety boss, but
the industry cringed, lamenting that putting the safety zealot in
charge of keeping miners safe would be like naming Ralph Nader to
head the Department of Transportation.
</P>
<P>
   McAteer, who eagerly accepts responsibility for the well-being
of the nation's 365,000 miners, admits that it's a challenge to
determine how big a health hazard workers face in asbestos-tainted
mines.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a hard sell with miners where the asbestos is
a contaminant to their ore,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   For years, many mine operators have told their workers that the
problem existed only at the now-closed Libby mine, that there is no
asbestos in the ore they're mining. But government and
mining-company documents _ some going back 30 years _ indicate that
this may not be true.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until the real story of Libby was made public last fall, no
one understood how widespread the potential risks may be,'' McAteer
says. ``It's a difficult message to pass to miners who think
they're healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got get them to understand that just like silica and
coal dust, if asbestos is contaminating the dust that they're
breathing today, it may shorten their lives, may kill them before
they reach the age when they can play with their grandchildren,''
McAteer says.
</P>
<P>
   A career forged by tragedy
</P>
<P>
   A rumbling explosion at Consolidated Coal Company's Number 9
mine, eight miles from his home in Farmington, W. Va., in 1968
shoved McAteer into the world of mine safety.
</P>
<P>
   McAteer, then a law student at West Virginia University, stood a
somber vigil for days with the rest of the small town, watching the
rescue effort, hoping that boys he went to school with, their
fathers and grandfathers would somehow survive. Twenty-one miners
escaped, but 78 were entombed in the deep shafts as the mine was
sealed to halt continuing explosions.
</P>
<P>
   Almost immediately, McAteer hunted down Ralph Nader, whose
reputation as a consumer advocate was spreading, and offered to run
a team of other law students to investigate mine safety in the
state. When McAteer's report was published five years later, West
Virginia passed laws that changed the way mines were regulated.
</P>
<P>
   Now, McAteer is wasting no time getting the asbestos message out
to the mining industry.
</P>
<P>
   Last week,the agency sent out a five-page bulletin to all mine
operators, miners' unions and associations in the country. It
discussed what happened at Libby, explained the hazards of asbestos
and explained how mine operators can protect workers from the
lethal fiber.
</P>
<P>
   Individual pocket safety cards are being printed now to be
distributed to every miner in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Education is vital in a situation like this, but so is
identifying precisely what the hazards are,'' McAteer says.
</P>
<P>
   Inspectors dispatched to mines
</P>
<P>
   MSHA has ordered special inspections of all mines where asbestos
may be present in the ore. Testing is being done at vermiculite
mines in Enoree, S.C., Woodruff, S.C., Louisa, Va., and Dillon,
Mont.; at the nation's only two operating asbestos mines near King
City, Calif.; at rock quarries in Sparta, N.J., North Branford,
Conn., and near San Jose, Calif.; at talc mines in Ludlow, Vt., and
Governeur, N.Y.; and at taconite mines in Hoyt Lakes and Silver
Bay, Minn., and two sites in northern Michigan. Several other
operations are on the list to be inspected.
</P>
<P>
   At each mine, the inspectors attached small, portable air pumps
to the workers while they did their normal jobs. Samples of the air
they were working in was drawn through fine filters. The filters
from the vacuum pumps were examined under a microscope at OHSA's
laboratory in Salt Lake City and the fibers of asbestos were
counted.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the initial testing showed levels below MSHA's
permissible exposure limit.
</P>
<P>
   That's not a clean bill of health, as some of the mine operators
boast, McAteer says.
</P>
<P>
   ``These say that the air testing came back below our limit,''
the safety boss says, waving a stack of test results. ``But MSHA's
limit is 20 times higher than OSHA's limit. There could be 20 times
more asbestos fibers in the sample than OSHA's limit and it could
be legal under our regulations. How can we say that's safe?''
</P>
<P>
   A try for safer limits
</P>
<P>
   The exposure standard that MSHA is working under was promulgated
27 years ago. Twelve years later, in 1989, the agency tried to
bring the asbestos exposure limits down to OSHA's safer standards.
</P>
<P>
   As it does every time the government proposes to reduce exposure
to any asbestos fiber, the industry flooded MSHA with opposition to
the agency's proposal. W.R. Grace said there was no need to lower
the permissible exposure limits for vermiculite mines, because it
claimed there was no asbestos in its South Carolina mines.
</P>
<P>
   The Asbestos Information Association, an industry-funded
lobbying group, cited medical studies which they claimed showed the
risk of asbestos exposure from the mines was minimal. But almost
all the studies the association cited were done by physicians and
researchers working on industry-funded projects.
</P>
<P>
   `Our asbestos isn't bad'
</P>
<P>
   ``The efforts to prevent the new standard were pretty much made
by the same people making the same statements they made in
defending Libby,'' McAteer says. ``They said `Our asbestos isn't
bad asbestos.' And, `these fibers are too short or the wrong shape
to be harmful' and `our mining process doesn't result in the kind
of asbestos problems exposure that would cause the disease.'''
</P>
<P>
   Agency files don't show why the effort was dropped in 1989. Now,
MSHA is again developing a proposal for a health standard for
asbestos that would lower the permissible exposure to OHSA's level.
There is little doubt that the opposition will quickly muster
against it once again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure we'll being hearing from the industry as soon as the
word gets out,'' says Dr. Carol Jones, director of MSHA's Office of
Standards, who helped OSHA implement its exposure level.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt that the miners will be safer if we can
reduce the exposure,'' Jones says. ``When you have a carcinogen
like asbestos, you want to have no exposure at all.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Jones, McAteer and other government experts who fight
to reduce the exposure level do a delicate balancing act _ lower
the standard as far as possible, but keep it high enough so the
mines can still operate.
</P>
<P>
   OSHA's .1 fiber per cubic centimeter of air still permits
exposure that is estimated to cause three or four cases of cancer
for each 1,000 workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to go to a level which won't close the mines,'' she
says. ``So that's the reason that .1 fiber still has significant
risk, because we couldn't go any lower, because we couldn't drive
everyone out of business.''
</P>
<P>
   New samples sought
</P>
<P>
   OSHA's level of ``.1'' sounds like a minute amount, but Jones
says that's not the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's 100,000 fibers per cubic meter. We breathe 10 cubic
meters of air in a work day if we're working hard, so that's a
million fibers. And with asbestos, research shows that, in some
cases, just one fiber could get into one cell and cause it to
become a tumor cell. It multiplies and you've got cancer,'' Jones
explains.
</P>
<P>
   McAteer says that last week his inspection teams went back to
the mines to take more air samples as well as samples of ore.
</P>
<P>
   The South Carolina and Virginia vermiculite mines are owned by
Grace and Robert Sansom, a former associate EPA administrator.
Neither take kindly to government prodding too hard into their
operations.
</P>
<P>
   But McAteer says he doesn't expect any problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have authority to take samples when and where we believe
dangerous exposures might exist and that is precisely what our
inspectors will do,'' the administrator says.
</P>
<P>
   `That's why he got the job'
</P>
<P>
   This isn't the first time that McAteer stood up to powerful
interests.
</P>
<P>
   The 56-year-old father of five hadn't had time to hang his
mementos of the walls of his new office in 1994 before Republicans
in Congress began clamoring for MSHA to be gutted, its staff cut by
60 percent, if not completely dismantled. But McAteer hung in, and,
in fact, strengthened the agency's watchdog actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why he got the job,'' says former Labor Secretary
Robert Reich, who brought McAteer into the agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Davitt comes from a mining family and he cares deeply and
passionately about what happens in those mines,'' Reich says. ``He
knows more about mining, the technology and the dangers than almost
anyone I've ever encountered.
</P>
<P>
   Reich, who was never shy about expressing his views when he was
labor secretary, cheers McAteer's candor.
</P>
<P>
   ``He says what he believes. It's not easy in Washington to tell
it like it is, but if you are telling the truth, giving an accurate
portrayal of reality and you have technical competence on your
side, then you're unassailable. That's the way he operates and he
thrives on challenges.''
</P>
<P>
   McAteer has made the health of miners a prime focus for his
agency, something, he says, that's no easy task.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had an epidemic of safety problems the magnitude of
Libby, with hundreds of miners dying, we'd take some action and do
so immediately,'' McAteer says. ``But with health problems, it
doesn't happen right away and it gets pushed back and pushed back
and pushed back until something forces it to the front again.
Meanwhile, lives that could have been saved have been lost. We
can't let this happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Safety problems, he says, can typically be corrected with a
mechanical fix.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a conveyor belt with a guard missing, you can put the
guard back on. A broken piece of equipment causes an accident, you
can repair it, but solving health problems is nowhere as simple,''
McAteer says. ``In health problems there's a latency period where
you don't see the impact for 15 years, typically. So it's a lot
harder to get people involved, be they the miners, be they the mine
operators, be they my own agency people.''
</P>
<P>
   `A public health matter'
</P>
<P>
   He's also not shy about asking other federal agencies to get
involved in solving problems, which is what he's proposing to do
with ore tainted with asbestos.
</P>
<P>
   ``A product like asbestos has potential for injury to workers at
a mine location, to workers at milling processors, and in other
manufacturing plants. This problem is a public health matter that
needs to be seriously addressed beyond the limits of our
authority,'' McAteer says, and adds, that a team effort is needed
to see how much of a problem the asbestos in the different ore may
be causing.
</P>
<P>
   ``MSHA will take the mines, OSHA will take the milling
operations and processing plants and the EPA the production plants
that use the ore,'' he says, drawing a triangle and pointing to the
corners.
</P>
<P>
   While McAteer plans for the future, he still worries about what
happened at Libby. His examination of the old reports showed that
the field inspectors did their job.
</P>
<P>
   ``The information about the dangers the workers faced at Libby
was passed on to Grace officials,'' he says. ``It should have been
passed up the chain to the head of this agency and it was not.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What worries me is that I can't tell you that that failure to
get the word to those of us who can make things happen isn't
happening today.''
</P>
<P>
   McAteer has done what he can to make sure that's not the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've spoken to all of our management and met with all of our
people up and down the line to say, `If you see a problem, you'd
better tell us.'
</P>
<P>
   `` We owe it to the miner.''

SPORTS COLUMN: THE SHADOW THAT HAUNTS THE TOURNEY
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. _ Two thousand school children were squealing
during practice, so Shaheen Holloway, the ebullient point guard for
Seton Hall, raised his arms, encouraging them to scream even
louder.
</P>
<P>
   ``They like me because I'm the same size,'' said Holloway, all
of 5 feet 10 inches tall.
</P>
<P>
   The first round of the national basketball tournament has all
the excitement of those grade school children on a field trip. This
first round belongs to poised college stars like Speedy Claxton of
Hofstra and Shaheen Holloway of Seton Hall and _ look up there at
the tube! _ to Messiah Capers of St. Bonaventure, who made three
foul shots to extend Kentucky into double overtime.
</P>
<P>
   The Bonnies eventually lost, but all his life Messiah Capers
will remember how Tubby Smith called two separate timeouts to ice
him but could not make him miss.
</P>
<P>
   There is so much joy and anticipation in the first round. And
then there is Bobby Knight. Glowering or smiling, cursing or
praising, he is impossible to ignore.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana University has been to the national tournament 15
straight years, and he is the only active coach to have won three
championships, and here he is again, playing Pepperdine Friday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Knight has not thrown anybody in a garbage can or acted
boorishly on a trip to Puerto Rico or flailed at his son on the
Indiana bench in over a decade. But as anger sinks deeper into his
self-indulgent face, he is still a presence.
</P>
<P>
   This week the forces of CNN and Sports Illustrated came up with
testimony that Knight belittles his players, acts in disgusting
fashion, and once wrapped his hands around the throat of a player
during practice. Nothing against investigative journalism, but this
unsurprising view sadly served to make Bobby Knight the center of
attention here.
</P>
<P>
   Two days ago, Knight admitted he might have put his hands on a
player's neck to guide him to his proper spot on the floor.
Thursday night he declined to discuss the specifics.
</P>
<P>
   First, his two best players, A.J. Guyton and Michael Lewis,
attended the mandatory news conference and said that Neil Reed, the
player who claimed he had been choked, had been voted off the team
by an 8-0 count, and that Richard Mandeville lacked the proper work
ethics.
</P>
<P>
   Then Knight came out for his obligatory appearance and gave a
monologue of controlled fury. He talked about his admirable
graduation rate, talked about the money his team had raised for
good causes, talked about the good deeds his players did. He made
jokes about his foul language and laughed at reports that he had
ordered a president out of practice, but he never discussed the
specifics about waving used toilet paper at players or putting his
hands on his players.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not reaching kids to play canasta,'' Knight said.
``We're playing a sport where kids get bloody noses and broken
legs. I can't say I'm proud of everything I did to motivate them.''
</P>
<P>
   He claimed that Isaiah Thomas had recently told him to never
change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't think I will,'' Knight added.
</P>
<P>
   School officials then passed out a remarkably indiscreet release
that said Reed had flatly denied the choking incident three years
ago, and that Mandeville had an ``alcohol-related incident'' in
school and ``pleaded'' to stay in school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ask Buckner, ask May, ask Chaney, ask Woodson,'' Knight said,
referring to former players.
</P>
<P>
   However, there was no discussion of his public tantrums, his
private rages at players. Timid college officials have created this
monster by continually overlooking anti-social behavior that would
get an English professor fired, tenure or not. Knight is Indiana's
problem, but he is also our problem, sucking the air out of a
regional.
</P>
<P>
   Not everybody sees it this way, of course. John Chaney, age 68,
is the sentimental favorite to reach the Final Four for the first
time. Chaney goads his Temple players but does not exude the
meanness Knight does, although Thursday Chaney asserted: ``You ask
my kids. I do worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Chaney was standing up for his bud. But enough of Bobby Knight.
Let's talk about Speedy Claxton who honored his commitment to
Hofstra, and Friday night gets to play in the national tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Let's talk about Shaheen Holloway, whose mother and grandmother
sent him from their neighborhood in Jamaica, Queens, to a private
school in New Jersey, not only for the basketball but for the life.
They were flying up for Friday's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why it's so great they had this tournament up here in
Buffalo,'' Holloway said.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, the snow was sticking. Inside, the children cheered and
asked for autographs from these college players. From here on, this
weekend belongs to the young and the joyous, not the seething bully
from Indiana.  &QL;

GERMAN CLEARED TO HEAD IMF AS RIVALS BOW OUT
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The contentious five-month-long scramble to find a
new leader for the International Monetary Fund came to a de facto
conclusion Thursday, as the Japanese and American rivals for the
job formally withdrew their nominations and cleared the path for a
German to take the post for the first time in the fund's history.
</P>
<P>
   Fund officials said the election of Horst Koehler, who heads the
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, was now a
foregone conclusion. An overwhelming majority of its 182 nations
have already signaled that they will back him.
</P>
<P>
   A coalition of African and Arab countries that had backed
Stanley Fischer, the American who serves as deputy managing
director of the monetary fund, withdrew his candidacy Thursday. And
Japan said it would vote for Koehler and was no longer pushing the
candidacy of Eisuke Sakakibara, former vice finance minister for
international affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Koehler, on a visit to Washington with Germany's finance
minister, Hans Eichel, had breakfast with Fischer Thursday and
lunch with Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers. The Clinton
administration tipped the scales in favor of Koehler this week when
it agreed to support him. He also won the backing of the 15-nation
European Union.
</P>
<P>
   Fischer, a former Massachusetts Institute of Technology
professor who is well regarded by fund members for his day-to-day
stewardship, reaffirmed his intention of remaining in the No. 2
post.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had an excellent meeting this morning with Koehler, during
which we discussed the challenges the fund faces,'' Fischer said in
a statement. ``I am confident that under his leadership the fund
will become an even more effective institution. I look forward to
working closely with him.''
</P>
<P>
   The development ends the leadership struggle at the fund, which
has been under intense pressure to streamline even with its
increasing prominence as a sort of world central bank. The United
States rejected Germany's first choice, arguing that the candidate,
Caio Koch-Weser, a state secretary in the Finance Ministry, did not
have the financial skills or leadership experience.
</P>
<P>
   The rejection set off a feud of sorts with Germany, which had
championed Koch-Weser and lined up grudging acceptance from the
European Union. After failing to win broad support for him in a
round of voting at the fund, the Germans backed Koehler.
</P>
<P>
   Neither man tops the lists of European financial officials. But
Koehler gained relatively quick endorsement, at least in part
because the European Union and the United States had no desire to
pick another fight with Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, who had
vested prestige in winning the job for a German.
</P>
<P>
   Koehler, 57, served as a top economic aide to Schroeder's
predecessor as chancellor, Helmut Kohl. Now, as head of the
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, he helps finance
development projects and back businesses in the former Soviet bloc.

<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ Six years and nearly $6 billion after
buying the Rover Group, BMW of Germany abandoned the British
automaker Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   BMW essentially gave Rover's money-losing car business to a
little-known group of British investors. And it negotiated a deal
to sell the Land Rover line of sport utility vehicles to Ford Motor
Co. for just under $3 billion, an executive involved in the
transaction said.
</P>
<P>
   The giveaway of Rover's car business was stunning enough. But
the Land Rover deal with Ford, which BMW is expected to announce
Friday, raised speculation about BMW's future strategy. Friday's
moves by BMW represented a retreat from a strategy of getting
bigger and broader, at a time when worldwide rivals are merging and
forming alliances.
</P>
<P>
   The ownership upheavals came as a shock to Rover's 30,000
workers in Britain as well as to the British government, which has
been hoping to salvage one of Rover's main factories with a
taxpayer subsidy around $220 million.
</P>
<P>
   BMW of Munich bought Rover in 1994 in hopes of expanding beyond
its market for luxury vehicles and of keeping up with larger
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's action represented a reversal for BMW and it
generated more uncertainty for Rover's workers, whose new boss will
be Alchemy Partners, an investor group that includes a former Rover
executive, Kevin Morley.
</P>
<P>
   Because nearly half of BMW's shares are controlled by the Quandt
family of Germany, which has so far rejected all overtures, BMW's
independence seems assured for now. But analysts say the pressures
are increasing. Volvo of Sweden sold its car business last year to
Ford. Earlier this week, the Agnelli family of Italy agreed to sell
20 percent of Fiat to General Motors.
</P>
<P>
   Though BMW did not disclose the terms, Alchemy Partners is
expected to pay little, if any, money up front and BMW will assume
many of Rover's debts.
</P>
<P>
   BMW said the expense of shedding the Rover car business would
cost about 3.15 billion euros, or $3.06 billion. As a result, it
will report an annual loss of about $2.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   BMW was officially silent Thursday on the future of Land Rover,
the profitable and growing sport utility business. An agreement to
sell Land Rover to Ford was expected to be announced Friday at the
Munich corporate headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   The jettisoning of Rover came as a relief to BMW investors, who
have viewed the British car line as a black hole for money. Rover
lost more than $1 billion in 1998 and $1.2 billion in 1999. Its car
sales plunged 24.9 percent last year, to 251,000 vehicles from
334,000 in 1998.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In further fallout from the Rover developments, BMW dismissed
three top executives, the second big boardroom shake-up in 13
months. The three executives, responsible respectively for
marketing, production, and research and development, had been named
to the board in February 1999 and were supposed to oversee the
integration of Rover and BMW.
</P>
<P>
   Joachim Millberg, who became chief executive after the ouster
last year of Bernd Pischetsrieder, appears to have been the main
architect of Thursday's moves and will remain.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Reitman, an automobile analyst in London with Merrill
Lynch, said Thursday that BMW's future would be brighter now that
it had freed itself from Rover. ``It has a massive effect on BMW,
in the sense that it removes a significant problem,'' Reitman said.
But he added, ``What it doesn't answer is the issue they themselves
have been talking about _ the need for scale.''
</P>
<P>
   Excluding Rover, BMW's profit margins are the highest of any car
manufacturer in the world except for Porsche. Reitman estimated
BMW's profit margin at 12 or 13 percent, when calculated on
American rather than German accounting standards. By contrast, he
said, the Mercedes business of DaimlerChrysler has a margin around
8.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But BMW faces assaults in the luxury market from the likes of
the Audi unit of Volkswagen AG, Volvo and the Jaguar division of
Ford, and of course, its principal German rival, DaimlerChrysler.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts are skeptical that sheer size is the basis of
success. But large size can make it easier to distribute research
and development costs over more vehicles and achieve economies of
scale.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal announced Thursday, Alchemy Partners will take
over Rover's money-losing line of midpriced sedans, including the
more expensive Rover 75, and it will acquire Rover's big factory at
Longbridge, near Birmingham, which has been in danger of closing
for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of trying to build smaller cars through Rover, BMW will
revive a strategy it discarded years ago and design a new line of
cheaper cars under the BMW brand. That is a reversal: BMW
executives had argued strenuously that they did not want ``to
stretch'' their prized brand with cars that sold too cheap.
</P>
<P>
   In an odd twist, BMW indicated that it would also give Alchemy
Partners the line of Mini subcompacts produced by Rover. Yet it
said it would retain the redesigned ``new Mini'' that is due out
later this year.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear exactly what will happen to Rover, but there were
signs Thursday that it would disappear as a brand name. In a
statement Thursday, Alchemy Partners said it would reintroduce
Rover as the MG Car Co. _ adopting the MG marque acquired years ago
by British Leyland, which owned Rover then.
</P>
<P>
   Under BMW's previous chief executive, Pischetsrieder, the
company committed itself to becoming bigger and capable of
competing in the largest and fastest-growing segment of the market
_ medium-priced mass-market cars.
</P>
<P>
   But the plan turned disastrous. The rising value of the British
pound, in relation to the falling euro, made British cars expensive
in Continental Europe and open to competition from companies like
Volkswagen and General Motors' Opel subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   Rover also failed to reduce its costs and the size of its labor
force. On top of all that, its midsize car models, the R-25 and
R-45, suffered declining popularity.
</P>
<P>
   Though many experts said the sale of Rover was overdue, some
analysts contend that BMW and the Quandt family were so concerned
with protecting their independence that they missed opportunities.
``It is the Quandts' biggest mistake,'' said Markus Pluemer, an
analyst with WestLB Research in Duesseldorf. Pluemer argued that
BMW could have rescued Rover by teaming up with a bigger
manufacturer like Volkswagen or General Motors.
</P>
<P>
   ``GM or Ford would have been willing to pay an enormous premium
for Rover,'' he said. Had BMW been willing to trade off 20 percent
of its shares, he continued, it could have preserved its
independence, raised billions in extra capital and tapped the
expertise of companies already making mass-market cars.
</P>
<P>
   Georg Stuerzer, an analyst at Hypovereinsbank in Munich, said
BMW could navigate on its own. Noting that shares of
DaimlerChrysler have plunged in the last year, Stuerzer argued that
BMW might have been well advised to focus on luxury cars. ``The
experience of Porsche gives us an indication,'' he said. ``If size
were indicative of operating margins, then Porsche should have the
lowest margins in the industry. But it has the highest.''

MORRIS ABRAM, 81, RIGHTS ADVOCATE WHO LED BRANDEIS UNIVERSITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By WILLIAM HONAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Morris B. Abram, a small-town boy from Georgia who went on to
play a role in the civil rights movement, become a leader of the
American Jewish community, serve as president of Brandeis
University and fill posts on a variety of commissions and panels
under five presidents, died Thursday at a hospital in Geneva. He
was 81.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a sudden viral infection, said Pranay Gupte, a
family friend.
</P>
<P>
   At his death Abram, who lived in Geneva, was chairman of U.N.
Watch, an organization affiliated with the World Jewish Congress
that he founded in 1993 with Edgar M. Bronfman, the businessman and
philanthropist. Abram was also counsel to the New York law firm of
Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &AMP; Garrison, where he had been a
partner for many years.
</P>
<P>
   In 1973, Abram was told he had acute myelocytic leukemia. His
fight against the disease impelled him to write an autobiography,
``The Day Is Short,'' in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   Abram was a young lawyer in Atlanta specializing in railroad
cases in 1949 when he began a 14-year struggle to overturn a
Georgia electoral rule that gave disproportionate weight in primary
elections to ballots cast in rural areas at the expense of those
cast in urban areas. The rule perpetuated segregation in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Abram felt the sting of the rule in 1953 when he sought the
Democratic nomination for Congress from the 5th District. He ran on
a platform that urged the desegregation of schools and carried
populous Fulton County, which includes Atlanta. But he lost two
smaller rural counties that had disproportionate weight under the
rule and lost the election.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years Abram helped bring cases against the rule to the
U.S. Supreme Court. On March 18, 1963, Attorney General Robert F.
Kennedy, who had been briefed by Abram, argued the case before the
Supreme Court. In a historic ruling, the court declared the rule
unconstitutional because ``within a given constituency there can be
room for but one constitutional rule _ one voter, one vote.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the most notable of Abram's victories in the civil rights
struggle. He also helped to start the first large, middle-income
housing project open to black families in Atlanta. And defending
civil rights workers in Georgia in 1963, he won decisions that
helped overturn the state's insurrection and illegal assembly laws,
which had been used against civil rights demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
   Abram's career in public service began when President John F.
Kennedy named him the first general counsel to the Peace Corps in
1961. President Lyndon B. Johnson made him U.S. representative to
the U.N. Commission on Human Rights, co-chairman of the Planning
Committee of the White House Conference on Civil Rights and a
member of the Committee on the Office of Economic Opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   President Jimmy Carter appointed him chairman of the President's
Commission for the Study of the Ethical Problems of Medicine. He
also served President Ronald Reagan as vice-chairman of the U.S.
Commission on Civil Rights. President George Bush designated him
U.S. permanent representative to the United Nations in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
   Morris Berthold Abram was born on June 19, 1918, in Fitzgerald,
Ga., a small railroad town founded by Northern veterans of the
Civil War. He was one of four children born to Sam Abram, a harness
maker and storekeeper born in Romania, and the former Irene Cohen,
the daughter of a doctor and a granddaughter of Rabbi Elias
Eppstein, one of the first Reform rabbis in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating summa cum laude from the University of Georgia
in 1938, Abram was chosen as a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford, but
Britain entered World War II before he could attend. Instead, Abram
entered the University of Chicago Law School, graduating in 1940.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, in which he served as an Army Air Corps public
relations officer, he attended Oxford, receiving a bachelor's
degree in 1948 and a master's degree in 1953. In a summer recess at
Oxford, a professor arranged for Abram to join the staff of
prosecutors at the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg.
</P>
<P>
   Horrified by what he learned about the Holocaust, he regarded
the experience as a turning point. He was national president of the
American Jewish Committee from 1963 to 1968; chairman of the
National Conference on Soviet Jewry from 1983 to 1988; and chairman
of the Conference of Presidents of Major Jewish Organizations from
1986 to 1989. He also helped to organize a demonstration of 200,000
people on the Mall in Washington protesting the refusal of the
Soviet Union to permit Jews to emigrate to Israel and the West.
</P>
<P>
   In 1963, he and his family moved to New York, where he joined
the law firm of Paul, Weiss. Five years later he was named
president of Brandeis, the nonsectarian university founded in 1948
under Jewish auspices in Waltham, Mass. He later wrote, ``Part of
me, it seemed, had done nothing for years except compile the right
sort of resume for the job.''
</P>
<P>
   But two years later he resigned the post amid turmoil and
bitterness.
</P>
<P>
   His inauguration was attended by Coretta Scott King, Bayard
Rustin and other figures from the civil rights movement. But soon
after, many students and faculty members demanded that the
university oppose the war in Vietnam and create housing for the
poor, among other demands.
</P>
<P>
   Abram would have none of it, insisting that ``the university as
an institution should stay out of politics.''
</P>
<P>
   He later acknowledged having made mistakes, like dismissing what
he considered an insubstantial proposal for a black studies program
with the insensitive remark, ``I do not wish to preside over a
university of superficialities.''
</P>
<P>
   On another occasion, when a group of students asked to be shown
the university's investment portfolio to see whether it was
``tainted,'' he said, jokingly, that Brandeis' endowment, compared
with those of other major American universities, ``taint enough.''
</P>
<P>
   The students were not amused. Soon, Abram recalled, they began
to ignore his greetings, and many on campus would go out of their
way to avoid him.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1969, 65 African-American students occupied Ford
Hall. Unlike the administrators of Harvard and Columbia when faced
with similar takeovers, Abram would not call in the police. After
11 days, the students drifted away and Abram earned praise in some
quarters for his restraint. But Abram lost whatever credit he
earned among many on campus when he tried to punish those
responsible for the takeover. This effort was thwarted by the
Brandeis board, faculty and disciplinary committees.
</P>
<P>
   Abram's presidency was fatally wounded. He resigned in 1970 and
returned to Paul, Weiss. For the next nine years, he also was
chairman of the United Negro College Fund, which raises money for
predominantly black colleges and universities.
</P>
<P>
   Abram's experience at Brandeis hardened his views, and he became
a vigorous opponent of affirmative action. This came to the
attention of President Reagan, and Abram was nominated to the U.S.
Commission on Civil Rights in 1983. The nomination was opposed by
some prominent blacks who considered him ``not committed to equal
opportunity,'' which pained Abram.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   He wrote about it in his autobiography: ``Liberalism for me
means that, while men differ in their natural endowments, they must
be treated as equal citizens in the eyes of the law; that they
should possess equality of opportunity and be afforded some minimum
of social benefits. These principles, which united American
liberals for generations, now divide me from some who seek equality
of result and who sanction the preferences imposed by government to
attain it.''
</P>
<P>
   Abram, who once considered himself a liberal Democrat, said he
never voted for a Democrat for president after Jimmy Carter.
</P>
<P>
   Abram's marriage to the former Jane Isabella Maguire ended in
divorce in 1974 and a second marriage, to Carlyn Feldman Fisher,
ended in divorce in 1987. He is survived by his wife, the former
Bruna Molina, whom he married in 1990; two daughters, Ann Abram of
Westport, Conn., and Ruth J. Abram of New York City, who is
president of the Lower East Side Tenement Museum.
</P>
<P>
   Also surviving are three sons, Morris Berthold Jr., of Los
Angeles, J. Adam, of Chapel Hill, N.C. and Joshua A., of New York
City; a stepson, Martin Molina of Zurich, Switzerland; a
stepdaughter, Gabriela Molina of Cambridge, England; a sister,
Ruthann Reis of Washington; a brother, Dr. Lewis Abram of Boca
Raton, Fla., and nine grandchildren.

 &HT;    Bush reaches out to McCain in speech
 &HT;    By Jena Heath
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHEATON, ILL. _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush extended an olive
branch to his former Republican primary rival Thursday,
complimenting Arizona Sen. John McCain and urging their party to
unite.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud to stand before you as the nominee of our party and
I'm honored and humbled by that,'' Bush told the $1,000-a-person
crowd at the Cantigny War Museum in kicking off a series of
fund-raising events.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I appreciate the competition. John McCain waged a good
fight. He ran a good campaign. He brought some good ideas to the
surface,'' Bush said. ``We had a good debate and I think it's very
important for all of us to recognize the contribution that John
made. ... It's important for us to unite and move forward. After
all, the biggest reform of all starts with getting rid of
Clinton-Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush camp was stung by controversy over an interview
published Thursday in The New York Times in which Bush made no move
to strike a conciliatory tone toward McCain. Reminded that McCain's
candidacy motivated record turnout in the primaries, Bush told The
Times: ``Well, then, how come he didn't win?'' Bush also said he
did not feel he needs to make concessions toward McCain.
</P>
<P>
   The remarks came as intermediaries between the two camps have
been working to find a path toward a McCain endorsement of Bush.
Both Bush and Vice President Al Gore will need the independents and
Democrats who supported McCain as they battle for victory in the
Nov. 7 general election.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech Thursday before 150 people, Bush pledged to hold
fast to his $483 billion, five-year tax cut proposal. The House
Budget Committee voted this week to approve a budget plan that
calls for $150 billion and possibly $250 billion in tax cuts over
five years starting in 2001, leaving Republicans in the odd
position of backing a tax plan smaller than the one their nominee
has advanced.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was undaunted by that vote, and by polls showing that
voters are not clamoring for a big tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``The press said, `No, the polls don't say people want their
money back,''' he told the crowd. ``Well, you know, I really don't
care what the polls say. ... I come from the school of thought that
says when you reduce marginal rates on people who pay the bills in
America, it encourages growth and more growth is what our party
ought to stand for and more growth is what this campaign
represents.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush spoke at the war museum, located on 500 acres in DuPage
County that once formed the estate of Col. Robert R. McCormick,
former editor and publisher of The Chicago Tribune. Wheaton, the
county seat, is 25 miles west of Chicago, but DuPage County
couldn't be farther from that Democratic stronghold when it comes
to political philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   Lyn Kennelly, DuPage GOP executive director, said she can't
remember the last time a Democrat held elected office there. She
sold about 1,400 tickets at $90 apiece to the county GOP's 39th
annual Lincoln Day dinner where Bush spoke after the museum event.
</P>
<P>
   Bush will need to visit more such Republican bastions to shore
up his campaign coffers. He is reportedly down to $6 million from
his $70 million in campaign contributions and is hoping to raise $5
million to $10 million by the end of April. He has at least a dozen
fund-raising events coming up and his ``Pioneers'' _ the campaign's
name for people who have raised at least $100,000 _ are revving
their engines.
</P>
<P>
   David Miner, a North Carolina state representative and Pioneer,
said supporters are rescheduling a fund-raiser originally set for
Feb. 10 that was canceled by Austin campaign officials after Bush
lost the New Hampshire primary to McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``After having come up short in New Hampshire, some people who
had not contributed yet felt a little uneasy about the whole McCain
prospect,'' Miner said. ``Now that the die has been set, now that
it's a Bush-Gore race ... I am extremely optimistic.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTPELIER, Vt. _ A bill to create ``civil unions'' giving gay
and lesbian couples virtually all the benefits of marriage cleared
its most critical legislative hurdle and gained final approval in
the Vermont state House of Representatives obn Thursday night,
setting the stage for the state to adopt the most sweeping set of
rights for same-sex couples in the country.
</P>
<P>
   The pivotal 76-69 vote came after hours of emotional debate on
topics from insurance to morality, and on the heels of an equally
close and hard-fought preliminary vote Wednesday night. The bill,
which gives spousal rights and privileges to same-sex couples, is
expected to pass more easily in the state Senate in April, , and
Gov. Howard Dean has said he will sign it, despite the deep schism
the issue has created among Vermonters.
</P>
<P>
   Meant to respond to a state Supreme Court ruling that same-sex
couples deserved all the same rights as heterosexual spouses, the
bill stopped short of calling the same-sex unions marriage, and in
fact, specified that marriage could only be between a man and a
woman.
</P>
<P>
   Though the bill, laboriously forged by the House Judiciary
Committee over recent weeks, makes a distinction between same-sex
unions and marriage, the benefits are virtually the same, in
providing state recognition for same-sex couples who cannot marry.
</P>
<P>
   Couples may apply for a license from a town clerk and receive a
certificate of civil union, the bill says. They then carry all the
benefits and responsibilities that spouses do, and if they split,
their union must be dissolved in a family court.
</P>
<P>
   For members of civil unions, the bill lists two dozen areas in
which the law would consider their roles to be just like those of
spouses, from child custody law to probate law to worker's
compensation to family leave benefits to immunity from being
compelled to testify.
</P>
<P>
   Backers of the bill said they did not expect other states to
recognize the legal status of Vermont's civil unions, so it did not
appear to raise any of the questions about ``full faith and
credit'' between states that a law allowing actual marriage would.
Legal experts have also testified that the civil unions would not
be portable.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state,'' the bill says, ``has a strong interest in
promoting stable and lasting families, including families based
upon a same-sex couple.''
</P>
<P>
   The state may, but a great many of its citizens remain opposed
to the idea of same-sex unions, and locked in hot debate with the
many citizens who support it.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Complaining that it was marriage in all but name; the opponents
of the bill even distributed small yellow plastic ducks to
lawmakers, symbols of their ads arguing that if something looks,
talks and swims like a duck, then it is a duck. Several ducks could
be seen Thursday night sitting on lawmakers' desks.
</P>
<P>
   Backers of the bill said that though it fell short of actual
marriage, it marked real progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big step in the right direction,'' said Nina Beck, a
partner in one of the three same-sex couples whose suit challenging
the state's refusal to let them marry led to the state supreme
court's decision. ``It's not what we set out to do,'' said Beck,
who stood to rock her four-month-old son beneath the chamber's
gilt-framed portrait of George Washington during the debate, ``but
it's many steps ahead of where we are now.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if she and her partner, Stacy Jolles, would go to their
town clerk to request a civil union certificate, she said, ``Sign
us up!''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In an interesting sidelight to the issue of same-sex marriage,
the bill also provides a more limited set of benefits to blood
relatives in another institution it calls ``reciprocal
beneficiaries.'' Dealing mainly with medical decisions and funeral
arrangements, it was meant to address situations in which, for
example, widowed sisters live together and are effectively life
partners, yet the state recognizes no special relationship between
them.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also provided for an oversight commission that would
follow the results of the civil union law, ``note its strengths and
shortcomings,'' and report on them.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The campaign to legalize gay marriage has aroused controversy
across the nation. California and Hawaii have statewide domestic
partnership systems, but these pale in their scope next to the new
Vermont law. Nearly 30 states have passed laws against gay
marriage, and California voters this month approved a proposition
declaring that marriage could legally exist only between a man and
a woman.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In Thursday night's debate, state Rep. Frank M. Mazur of South
Burlington warned that Vermont's moves toward recognizing same-sex
couples left him worried about whether it might hurt the state's
business climate. He said he was concerned ``about whether there'll
be a boycott against the state.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Vermont is not an island,'' Mazur said. ``We depend upon other
states,'' and many of those states have made their views clear by
passing Defense of Marriage Acts that specify that they would not
recognize same-sex marriages if another state ever approved them.
</P>
<P>
   A diametrically opposed argument came from state Rep. Marion C.
Milne, a Republican, who contended that the Legislature must
respect the state Supreme Court's finding that same-sex couples had
been enduring unconstitutional discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will vote for this bill because I believe it is
constitutionally mandated, but more importantly, because I believe
it is the right thing to do,'' Ms. Milne said. She invoked the
future, noting that the results of the vote would linger long after
she and her fellow lawmakers were gone.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, state Rep. Nancy Sheltra, R-Derby, invoked the
future differently: ``It's going to be very hard for me to explain
to the next generation why the State Legislature decided to define
marriage in a different manner and take away the moral standards we
have stood for in this state,'' Ms. Sheltra said.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Lippert, the only openly gay member of the Legislature,
offered a vision of a different future: ``Those of you who vote
`no' on this bill for a variety of reasons, I'm sorry for your
fear,'' Lippert said. ``I'm sorry, because we gay and lesbian
couples are not a threat,'' as opponents will discover with time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look forward to living together and to living in growing
fairness in the state of Vermont,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the more immediate future, the bill now goes to the
Democrat-dominated state Senate, where leaders have said they
believe they have the votes to get it passed. The Legislature is
hoping to finish its current session by mid- or late April, and its
leaders have said they wanted to respond to the Supreme Court
ruling by session's end.
</P>
<P>
   A lobbyist for opponents of the bill, Bill Shouldice, said
Wednesday night that he expected the bill to undergo more changes
in its time in the Senate, and that, in fact, his side had been
saving some of its fire until then.
</P>
<P>
   There is another reason for the bill to cruise ahead in the
Legislature: The same-sex issue is likely to have repercussions on
this fall's elections in Vermont, and some politicians have said
they would like to get it behind them well in advance.

VERMONT LEGISLATORS BACK `CIVIL UNIONS' FOR GAY COUPLES 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTPELIER, Vt. _ A bill to create ``civil unions'' giving gay
and lesbian couples virtually all the benefits of marriage cleared
its most critical legislative hurdle and gained final approval in
the Vermont state House of Representatives on Thursday night,
setting the stage for the state to adopt the most sweeping set of
rights for same-sex couples in the country.
</P>
<P>
   The pivotal 76-69 vote came after hours of emotional debate on
topics from insurance to morality, and on the heels of an equally
close and hard-fought preliminary vote Wednesday night. The bill,
which gives spousal rights and privileges to same-sex couples, is
expected to pass more easily in the state Senate in April, , and
Gov. Howard Dean has said he will sign it, despite the deep schism
the issue has created among Vermonters.
</P>
<P>
   Meant to respond to a state Supreme Court ruling that same-sex
couples deserved all the same rights as heterosexual spouses, the
bill stopped short of calling the same-sex unions marriage, and in
fact, specified that marriage could only be between a man and a
woman.
</P>
<P>
   Though the bill, laboriously forged by the House Judiciary
Committee over recent weeks, makes a distinction between same-sex
unions and marriage, the benefits are virtually the same, in
providing state recognition for same-sex couples who cannot marry.
</P>
<P>
   Couples may apply for a license from a town clerk and receive a
certificate of civil union, the bill says. They then carry all the
benefits and responsibilities that spouses do, and if they split,
their union must be dissolved in a family court.
</P>
<P>
   For members of civil unions, the bill lists two dozen areas in
which the law would consider their roles to be just like those of
spouses, from child custody law to probate law to worker's
compensation to family leave benefits to immunity from being
compelled to testify.
</P>
<P>
   Backers of the bill said they did not expect other states to
recognize the legal status of Vermont's civil unions, so it did not
appear to raise any of the questions about ``full faith and
credit'' between states that a law allowing actual marriage would.
Legal experts have also testified that the civil unions would not
be portable.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state,'' the bill says, ``has a strong interest in
promoting stable and lasting families, including families based
upon a same-sex couple.''
</P>
<P>
   The state may, but a great many of its citizens remain opposed
to the idea of same-sex unions, and locked in hot debate with the
many citizens who support it.

<P>
   Complaining that it was marriage in all but name; the opponents
of the bill even distributed small yellow plastic ducks to
lawmakers, symbols of their ads arguing that if something looks,
talks and swims like a duck, then it is a duck. Several ducks could
be seen Thursday night sitting on lawmakers' desks.
</P>
<P>
   Backers of the bill said that though it fell short of actual
marriage, it marked real progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big step in the right direction,'' said Nina Beck, a
partner in one of the three same-sex couples whose suit challenging
the state's refusal to let them marry led to the state supreme
court's decision. ``It's not what we set out to do,'' said Beck,
who stood to rock her four-month-old son beneath the chamber's
gilt-framed portrait of George Washington during the debate, ``but
it's many steps ahead of where we are now.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if she and her partner, Stacy Jolles, would go to their
town clerk to request a civil union certificate, she said, ``Sign
us up!''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In an interesting sidelight to the issue of same-sex marriage,
the bill also provides a more limited set of benefits to blood
relatives in another institution it calls ``reciprocal
beneficiaries.'' Dealing mainly with medical decisions and funeral
arrangements, it was meant to address situations in which, for
example, widowed sisters live together and are effectively life
partners, yet the state recognizes no special relationship between
them.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also provided for an oversight commission that would
follow the results of the civil union law, ``note its strengths and
shortcomings,'' and report on them.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   The campaign to legalize gay marriage has aroused controversy
across the nation. California and Hawaii have statewide domestic
partnership systems, but these pale in their scope next to the new
Vermont law. Nearly 30 states have passed laws against gay
marriage, and California voters this month approved a proposition
declaring that marriage could legally exist only between a man and
a woman.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In Thursday night's debate, state Rep. Frank M. Mazur of South
Burlington warned that Vermont's moves toward recognizing same-sex
couples left him worried about whether it might hurt the state's
business climate. He said he was concerned ``about whether there'll
be a boycott against the state.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Vermont is not an island,'' Mazur said. ``We depend upon other
states,'' and many of those states have made their views clear by
passing Defense of Marriage Acts that specify that they would not
recognize same-sex marriages if another state ever approved them.
</P>
<P>
   A diametrically opposed argument came from state Rep. Marion C.
Milne, a Republican, who contended that the Legislature must
respect the state Supreme Court's finding that same-sex couples had
been enduring unconstitutional discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will vote for this bill because I believe it is
constitutionally mandated, but more importantly, because I believe
it is the right thing to do,'' Ms. Milne said. She invoked the
future, noting that the results of the vote would linger long after
she and her fellow lawmakers were gone.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, state Rep. Nancy Sheltra, R-Derby, invoked the
future differently: ``It's going to be very hard for me to explain
to the next generation why the State Legislature decided to define
marriage in a different manner and take away the moral standards we
have stood for in this state,'' Ms. Sheltra said.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Lippert, the only openly gay member of the Legislature,
offered a vision of a different future: ``Those of you who vote
`no' on this bill for a variety of reasons, I'm sorry for your
fear,'' Lippert said. ``I'm sorry, because we gay and lesbian
couples are not a threat,'' as opponents will discover with time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look forward to living together and to living in growing
fairness in the state of Vermont,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the more immediate future, the bill now goes to the
Democrat-dominated state Senate, where leaders have said they
believe they have the votes to get it passed. The Legislature is
hoping to finish its current session by mid- or late April, and its
leaders have said they wanted to respond to the Supreme Court
ruling by session's end.
</P>
<P>
   A lobbyist for opponents of the bill, Bill Shouldice, said
Wednesday night that he expected the bill to undergo more changes
in its time in the Senate, and that, in fact, his side had been
saving some of its fire until then.
</P>
<P>
   There is another reason for the bill to cruise ahead in the
Legislature: The same-sex issue is likely to have repercussions on
this fall's elections in Vermont, and some politicians have said
they would like to get it behind them well in advance.

 BUSH TRIES TO ALLAY NEW CRITICISMS BY McCAIN SUPPORTERS

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHEATON, Ill. _ Gov. George W. Bush went out of his way Thursday
to demonstrate respect for Sen. John McCain, pointing to areas of
agreement between him and his vanquished rival for the Republican
presidential nomination and saying, ``I'm confident we can work
together.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush made his comments in two speeches Thursday and at a news
conference this afternoon, as aides and supporters of McCain
criticized Bush for remarks in an interview with The New York Times
on Wednesday. They said the Texas governor had made it more
difficult to work out a reconciliation between the two men.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Bush said McCain had made him a better
candidate, but he also said he had no intention of making
concessions to McCain and passed up several opportunities to
embrace his signature proposal to overhaul the campaign finance
laws. Bush also challenged the notion that McCain had been
responsible for the huge surge in voter turnout during the
Republican primaries, saying, ``Well, then, how come he didn't
win?''
</P>
<P>
   Todd Harris, a spokesman for McCain said, ``Obviously we're
disappointed with the governor's tone, but it doesn't change any of
our plans. Senator McCain is committed to campaigning for
reform-minded Republicans across the country.'' He sidestepped the
question of whether McCain would ultimately endorse Bush.
</P>
<P>
   But another aide to McCain said that the interview had made an
endorsement less likely. And Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., who was a
national co-chairman of the McCain campaign, said, ``I don't think
it enhances the bridge-building that needs to be done here. That
was a pretty arrogant interview and it doesn't help what we're all
trying to do here.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, Bush's probable Democratic opponent in
the general election, who is trying to win over some McCain
supporters, also jumped into the fray. He chided Bush for saying
that McCain had not changed his views on reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he should have been taking notes from John McCain,''
Gore said Thursday to a gathering in Washington of about 50 members
of the Amalgamated Transit Union.
</P>
<P>
   Taking advantage of the Republican divisions, Gore cited
McCain's criticisms of Bush's proposal to cut taxes by $483 billion
over five years. Had Bush taken notes, Gore said, ``he could have
written down the statistics that John McCain pointed out _ that his
risky tax scheme gives 60 percent of all of the benefits to the
wealthiest 10 percent of the people.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In his interview, Bush called the tax cut ``a well-thought-out
plan backed by numbers backed by credible sources.'' He said he
believed voters are interested in tax relief.
</P>
<P>
   In the governor's public appearances and in a series of
telephone calls, the Bush camp made a concerted effort to try to
smooth relations with the McCain camp.
</P>
<P>
   The presumptive Republican presidential nominee brought up
McCain in a luncheon speech in Springfield, saying: ``I appreciate
the hard campaign that John McCain waged. He ran a good race. He
highlighted the need for reform, and I appreciate the ideas that he
brought forth in the campaign. Of course, he and I agree on a lot,
and it starts with this: the best reform for America is to end the
Clinton-Gore era in Washington, D.C.''
</P>
<P>
   Later at a news conference in Springfield, Bush referred to The
New York Times article indirectly, saying, ``There's a story out
today that doesn't characterize how I feel.''
</P>
<P>
   He directed attention instead to a interview on the front page
of The Dallas Morning News quoting him as saying he wanted to mend
fences with McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how I feel,'' he said holding up the Texas newspaper.
``I look forward to working with Senator McCain.'' He added that
the senator ``ran a good campaign. He brought forth some issues
that are important and I'm confident that we can work together.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted that both men, for instance, want to change the Social
Security system to allow younger workers to have personal
investment accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's aides also contacted McCain's aides and supporters. Staff
members for both men said that Joe Allbaugh, the governor's
campaign manager, called John Weaver, McCain's political director.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as we saw The New York Times story, we immediately
reached out to Senator McCain's staff and advisers to tell them
that The New York Times story was not a full and fair reflection of
what the governor has said about Senator McCain,'' said Ari
Fleischer, a spokesman for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   He said, ``We provided them with the quotes that were excluded
from the story, that were put at the bottom of the page of the
transcript, off the front page and out of the headlines.'' He said
Bush aides also told the McCain campaign about The Dallas Morning
News interview.
</P>
<P>
   The question of how to handle McCain has been a sensitive one
for Bush because even while the Arizona senator lost popularity
among Republicans, he attracted to his side many independent and
swing voters who could well determine which party wins the November
election.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Both Bush and Gore are already casting themselves as reformers
and vying for the allegiance of McCain;'s followers.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the two men's agendas are difficult to reconcile. McCain is
particularly focused on winning a ban on the unlimited, unregulated
donations to political parties known as soft money. Yet Bush has
stopped short of endorsing such a ban and many of his staunchest
allies adamantly oppose such legislation, arguing that it would
hamper the ability of Republicans and conservatives to fight for
their causes.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who is on vacation in the South Pacific, suspended his
presidential campaign last week but stopped short of endorsing Bush
after their bitter primary struggle. He vowed to keep up a battle
for his issue agenda, ranging from overhauling the campaign finance
law to mixing moderate tax cuts with debt reduction.
</P>
<P>
   McCain made no statement himself on Bush's remarks, but Hagel
said, ``I can guarantee that he knows about it. Right next to that
grass hut, he's got his fax machine winging along.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., who supported McCain, also was critical
of Bush on Thursday, saying, ``either he's arrogant or he's
politically tone deaf.''
</P>
<P>
   Aides to the Arizona senator revealed this week that he was
creating his own political action committee to help him keep up a
national political presence and keep his supporters mobilized. They
said McCain planned to campaign in November for candidates who
share his views and that he also planned to stump for a ban on
unlimited unregulated donations to political parties.
</P>
<P>
   Among the activities tentatively in the planning stages, aides,
said, is a a tour of college campuses where McCain would hold the
kind of town hall meetings he popularized in New Hampshire.

 SPORTS COLUMN: GUESS WHAT AL McGUIRE MISSES THE MOST THESE DAYS?  
(rk) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Al McGuire's voice sounded as sturdy as it ever had when it was
crackling with laughter on television.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm getting a lot of sympathy,'' he was saying. ``I go to this
Manhattan bagel place down here and the guy who owns it, I guess he
read where I'm not working the NCAA this year and when I went in
there the other morning, he buys me my bagel and coffee.''
</P>
<P>
   Al McGuire laughed and said, ``If I knew the guy was reaching,
I'd have had an egg on it.'' Weakened by anemia, basketball's old
philosopher was on the telephone from his condo in Singer Island,
Fla., Thursday instead of perching where he usually has for more
than two decades when the college tournament is on: at courtside as
a television analyst.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm all right,'' he was saying, ``but the arenas, the hotels,
the airports are big places. It makes it hard to get around.''
</P>
<P>
   Now 71, he talked about how he will miss the tournament but when
he was asked what he will miss the most, he didn't laugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds phony, but I'll miss the national anthem,'' he said.
``I thought about this the other day sitting on the beach. When
they play the anthem, it's the only silence you're going to have.
The players, the coaches, the students, the neurosurgeons in their
beanies. Then after the anthem, it's an explosion.''
</P>
<P>
   What he did not miss was having to learn to identify the players
when eight teams, some of which he had never seen before, practice
the day before a subregional began.
</P>
<P>
   ``One year one team came out with no names, no numbers on their
shirts,'' he said, laughing. ``You had to find out which guys were
wearing low socks or high socks.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that Al McGuire needed names or numbers. All he ever needed
was his outlook on basketball and on life, an outlook developed
growing up in his family's bar in Rockaway Beach, playing for St.
John's and the Knicks, coaching at Belmont Abbey and then at
Marquette, where his 1977 team won the N CAA championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no training for analysts,'' he often said. ``You can't
prepare for it because if you prepare for it, it comes over flat.
It comes over like a charade, like watching paint dry.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years at both the CBS and NBC networks, McGuire worked
with nearly a dozen different announcers, notably Billy Packer and
Dick Enberg, but the game was always the thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the game is good, the announcers should let it be,'' he
once explained. ``An announcer should never cut into a game if the
game is in the 12-point or 18-point area. But if it goes over 18
points, you have to be more creative or do more talking to the
future and the past, or get into the hobbies and who eats Jell-O
and who doesn't eat Jell-O.''
</P>
<P>
   His words on basketball and life have endured as if chiseled in
stone, or at least in playground blacktop:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``If you haven't broken your nose in basketball, you haven't
really played. You've just tokened it.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``They call me eccentric; they used to call me nuts. I haven't
changed. The only difference between being eccentric and being nuts
is the number of security boxes you have.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Sports is a coffee break. Winning is only important in war
and surgery.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``I think everyone should go to college and get a degree, then
spend six months as a bartender and six months as a cab driver.
Then they'd really be educated.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Anyone who offers to double your money, walk away. If he
offers to make you 20 percent, hear him out.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``If you're at a flea market and see something you want but
don't buy it, when you go back, it'll be gone.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Postseason tournaments'' meaning conference tournaments,
``are a waste of time. I think they should knock them all out and
put 256 teams in the NCAA tournament. It would just take one more
week. You open up at 32 sites, then the next week you're down to 64
teams, then 16, then four and out.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Pre-game meals? Give me kids who'll win on a pizza and a
Coke.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``If a guy takes off his watch before he fights, he means
business.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``If you want to determine if a guy's hanging on the rim,
electrify the rim. If a guy's hand touches it, you leave the juice
on until he turns blue.''
</P>
<P>
   As an analyst, he was different but he didn't remember ever
being critiqued by his television bosses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don Ohlmeyer,'' he was saying now, referring to his former NBC
boss, ``told me, `You're so bad, you're good.'''
</P>
<P>
   But what he called his ``finest compliment'' came after he left
Marquette with the 1977 NCAA title.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother told me, `I'm glad you left clean,''' he said, ``She
meant without having had any trouble with minorities, without being
sued, without any expense-account scheme.''
</P>
<P>
   As a television analyst, Al McGuire has left clean, too.

3 CENSUS MANAGERS DISMISSED  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By TESSIE BORDEN  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   With less than three weeks left before Census Day, officials
have fired three top managers of south Phoenix's Census 2000 office
for recruiting the fewest census workers in a 10-state region.
</P>
<P>
   The office, which serves some of the hardest-to-count groups in
all of Maricopa County, needs 5,080 people by the end of the month.
So far, it has hired 3,001. Nationwide, it is in the bottom 10
percent in recruiting efforts among local offices.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've stressed that for a month now, and the numbers have not
come up,'' said Sam Martinez, who manages census efforts in most of
Arizona. ``That's why they were relieved of their duties.''
</P>
<P>
   Those fired this week were Al Jauregui, local census office
manager; Jim Shee, assistant manager for recruiting; and Frank
Cano, assistant manager for administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said that they weren't happy with the job we'd done,''
Shee said.
</P>
<P>
   But the move to replace the office managers could further harm
an effort that community members say has been disorganized and
slow-starting in an area often undercounted because residents are
transient, little educated or undocumented.
</P>
<P>
   The seasonal workers are needed to personally survey census
stragglers who don't fill out forms mailed out this week. That push
begins April 27.
</P>
<P>
   Luis Enriquez, director of adult education at Friendly House,
said census officials should have started recruiting weeks ago,
given the expected problems _ and the fact that prospective workers
have to take a test, go through a background check and be trained.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they knew this was a hard-to-count area, why didn't they
start earlier?'' Enriquez asked. ``It's tough to recruit in this
area, especially 2,000 people.''
</P>
<P>
   Rudolfo Perez, who had been working with census officials in
behalf of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education fund,
agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand that they were concerned with the low numbers of
people that have been hired so far,'' he said. ``(But) it's pretty
shocking to make this kind of a decision so late in the ball
game.''
</P>
<P>
   If the south Phoenix office lacks workers, officials will have
to bring in workers from other areas in the Phoenix area or the
state, which Martinez said would defeat their goal of hiring local
workers with whom residents felt more comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona missed 2.4 percent of its population during the 1990
census, according to regional Census Bureau figures. Among the
invisible ones were 32,223 Hispanics and 21,570 Native Americans.
Martinez said the state is the second fastest-growing in the Union,
so the potential for an undercount becomes an even bigger problem.
</P>
<P>
   COUNTERS FACE HURDLES
</P>
<P>
   He said counters face four hurdles in Arizona: skyrocketing
growth, rivers of undocumented workers, the annual pilgrimage of
snowbirds who spend winters here, and far-flung, hard-to-find
Native Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Enriquez said his agency, which trains poor people to join the
workforce, could get stretched by an undercount because it would
get less federal grant money to serve more people.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always a need,'' he said. ``This is always an
invisible population, and their needs come to us. For us, an
accurate count is vital because then we can get some proper funding
for services this community vitally needs.''
</P>
<P>
   Enriquez and other community organizers believe the Census
Bureau's efforts to get the word out in their neighborhoods has
been adequate. But that may not matter much if it doesn't have
enough people to do the counting, they say.
</P>
<P>
   MANY TO IGNORE FORMS
</P>
<P>
   A recent survey by Behavior Research Center, a Phoenix polling
firm, said 16 percent of Arizona Hispanics plan to ignore the
census forms they get in the mail and 32 percent aren't sure if
they will fill them out. Census counters could play a crucial role
in convincing them, Martinez said.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez replaced the fired managers with employees from the
Mesa census office, including Manuel Trujillo, who was in charge of
recruiting in Mesa.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to get more workers, Census 2000 will hold a
recruiting fair Saturday beginning at 10 a.m. in 12 Phoenix area
locations, said Doug Wayland, regional Census 2000 spokesman. &QL;

   HOPEWELL, N.J. _ Leslie Kramer and her husband moved into a big

would protect open space and direct growth back to urban areas.

   But like forest creatures who are too slow to outrun a wildfire,
the Kramers and the Ferrys have found that the crowded old
neighborhoods they tried to flee are on their way to them, led by a
giant new development that could produce more office space than a
tower of the World Trade Center. And when new census figures this
month showed formerly rural parts of New Jersey growing faster than
anyplace in the region, it was a reminder that stopping sprawl and
talking about it are two very different things.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you what I believe _ you can't stop it,'' said
Kramer, the leader of a failed effort to stop Merrill Lynch from
building a project starting at 3.5 million square feet and could
grow to 5.5 million in an old cornfield here. ``My husband hit me
over the head with that fact all along and I didn't believe him. I
kept saying, `No, this is so wrong on so many levels _ look what
it's doing to our community, look how it violates the State Plan,
look how it goes against everything the governor said she was going
to do!' But you know, he was right. You can't stop it, not if the
people with the money want it.''
</P>
<P>
   If anything, the existence of anti-sprawl measures like New
Jersey's state plan and the governor's fervent calls for protecting
open space may only deepen residents' sense of betrayal when a
project like the one being built by Merrill Lynch here starts
rising in a neck of the state that looks more like Vermont than New
Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   The Hopewell project, which began construction about two years
ago, also demonstrates anew how money and jobs _ in this case the
company's threat to move 3,500 jobs to Pennsylvania _ can trump
public land preservation policy.
</P>
<P>
   So whether it is the project here, or the 1 million square feet
of laboratories that AT&AMP;T recently opened in Middletown, Monmouth
County, or the plans to develop 2,000 acres of woods near Stewart
Airport in Orange County, N.Y., sprawl continues to march on across
the region.

   Some figures from New Jersey: of the 9.9 million square feet of
office space authorized by local officials through November last
year, nearly two thirds is being built in an outer ring of largely
rural counties of Morris, Somerset, Hunterdon, Monmouth, Mercer and
Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Somerset, the fastest growing county in the New York
metropolitan region, added more than half a million square feet
alone, while Mercer County, home of Princeton and Hopewell and two
hours from Manhattan, leads the state with 2.1 million square feet
of office space authorized last year, much of it from the Merrill
Lynch project.
</P>
<P>
   The Regional Planning Partnership, a non-profit land-use
planning group that studies growth in Mercer, Somerset and
Middlesex counties, forecasts a 40 percent population increase by
2020 in the region. Even more striking than population growth
trends, however, are land use trends. The group said that while the
region's population grew 21 percent from 1976 to 1996, the land
area developed increased by 61 percent. And most of that came
before the area's boom began in earnest.

   In her 1998 inaugural address, Whitman announced a $1 billion
open space preservation bond act, to buy up 1 million acres of open
land, and declared, ``We must do more to encourage intelligent,

cities.'' The bond act was passed by the voters by a wide margin.

sprawl in the next 25 years.

   But such pledges to stem sprawl have come too late for residents
here, who failed to follow the local planning process until it was
too late, said Samuel H. Hamill, Jr. a former local planning board
president and now senior consultant to New Jersey Future, a growth
management think tank. That aloofness from the nitty-gritty of
planning issues, he said, is now ending.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only did the governor's bond act pass, but there were any
number of local elections that turned on these very questions.''
Hamill said.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch had one big factor going in its favor: the land it
company chose was zoned for a big project like the one it wanted to
develop, however incongruous it might seem to someone driving
slowly by on the rural lane that bordered the site. But if the
state had any misgivings, they were erased when Merrill Lynch made
plain that it was going to be Hopewell or another state, probably
an equally rustic corner of Pennsylvania. Whitman, concerned with
the company's threat to pull 3,500 or more jobs from the state,
gave the project political and financial support.
</P>
<P>
   The state applied for and got $38.5 million in federal money to
rebuild the interchange at Interstate 95 and Scotch Road, where the
Merrill Lynch project is being built, and it has agreed to help the
company avoid $13.5 million in sales taxes. In addition, the state
said it would give the company $6.4 million to create at least
1,100 new jobs at the site, which will eventually employ 3,500.
Finally, Merrill Lynch, the country's largest brokerage house, will
get $135 million in grants for job creation at Hopewell and at its
10 other New Jersey sites.

   Eileen McGinnis, the governor's chief policy adviser, lives in
Hopewell and defends the project, even as she has her own personal
misgivings about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I separate my personal feelings from my professional
feelings,'' McGinnis said. ``On a personal level I drive by it
every day and I do wish the project wasn't there. But on a
professional level I know that the State Plan is not about no
growth, it's about smart growth.''

</P>
<P>
   The State Plan, adopted in 1992 as guidelines for directing
growth to areas with transportation access and to already built-up
areas, is often invoked by preservationists for its goal that the
state should use its power to push some new development towards the
state's hollowed-out cities. But the plan's guidelines are
advisory, not mandatory and subject to economic and political
pressures.
</P>
<P>
   The Merrill Lynch site is designated for growth under the State
Plan as an area with public space such as retail and housing.
Critics point out, however, that there is no public component in
the 3.5 million square foot first phase.
</P>
<P>
   The site is designated as a growth area under the State Plan,
because it is adjacent to an interstate highway.

   But Jeff Tittle, executive director of the New Jersey Sierra
Club, maintains that by helping Merrill Lynch build on a pristine
rural site, it was working against its own aim of buying land for a
public greenway trail from the Delaware River to Princeton through
Hopewell, since all land in the area will now be made much more
expensive by the immense new development.

<P>

<P>
   Building deep in the country makes perfect sense from the
company's perspective, said Hamill, even though the state might
have wished that the project had gone go to a city like Trenton,
which has acres of unused industrial space, and which lies only a
few miles from Hopewell.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cities in general, and Trenton is no exception, are much
less certain than the suburbs as planning environments,'' Hamill
said. ``Things don't happen as quickly in the cities, buildings
inspections aren't on time and policy plans are much more vague, so
anyone going there has this uncertainty in the approval process.''
</P>
<P>
   When Merrill Lynch told the state that it would build in
Hopewell or leave New Jersey, state officials gingerly raised the
idea of building in Trenton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Merrill Lynch officials said very clearly that they would not
look at Trenton,'' said Tom Dalessio, an assistant in the
governor's policy office. ``They wanted a suburban style campus, so
it was either here or Pennsylvania.''
</P>
<P>
   In Hopewell, Merrill Lynch found 450 acres of open farmland that
had been owned, with development in mind, by Bristol Myers Squibb,
the pharmaceutical concern, since 1955.
</P>
<P>
   It also found a five-member all-Republican town board with
strong land-owner sympathies that welcomed the prospect of millions
of dollars in new taxes for sewers and schools. It did not hurt
that the company also bought 440 additional acres across the road
from William E. Schluter, an influential state senator who sits on
the Economic Growth, Agriculture and Tourism committee.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch has final approval to build 1.3 million square
feet of office space on the land, and has preliminary approval to
build 2.2 million more at the site. The adjacent 440 acres is zoned
for 2 million square feet of commercial development, for a total of
5.5 million square feet potential _ and probable _ construction on
both sides of the road. One World Trade Center tower contains 4
million square feet.
</P>
<P>
   Local reaction followed the now familiar arc from surprise to
anger to despair. An anti-growth coalition swept the Republicans on
the town board and replaced them with a 4-to-1 Democratic majority
that succeeded in stopping Merrill Lynch's preferred sewer option _
it has others _ but could not block the development.

When they left for Hopewell in 1985, she said, the fields in
Hamilton were covered with houses, and a drive that once took ten

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SIOUX CITY, Iowa _ David Howe, a big corn and soybean farmer
near this town nestling the Nebraska border, says he is tired of
people treating his genetically engineered crops as freaks of
nature.
</P>
<P>
   To him, genetically modified seeds and the foods they produce
are entirely safe. He has been planting such seeds for three years
and expects to do so for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm extremely bothered by what they're saying in Europe,''
Howe said, referring to the loud and growing opposition to
genetically modified food in places like France and Britain. ``I
hear it called `Frankenstein foods,' but what damage has it done?''
</P>
<P>
   Genetically modified seeds have been biologically altered to
release their own insecticide or to immunize themselves against
weed killers and other chemicals or against pests. Despite the
rancorous debate overseas and a smattering of protests in the
United States over the safety of gene-altered foods, Howe and many
other American farmers now expect to plant the crops again this
year because they are easier and cheaper to grow, and because there
is still a big market for them in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   More important, the nation's largest agricultural companies have
formed a line of defense against the opposition by promising
farmers that they will buy their gene-altered grains. Cargill Inc.
and Archer-Daniels-Midland _ two of the largest grain-handling
companies _ say they will welcome the crops at most of their grain
elevators, where they buy and store crops before shipping them to
food companies.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Major seed companies _ Monsanto, DuPont's Pioneer Hi-Bred
International unit and Novartis of Switzerland _ have held forums
around the country this winter in a bid to assure farmers that the
big grain companies will buy what they grow.
</P>
<P>
   That is comforting to farmers like Gary Dreckman in Le Mars,
Iowa, who says he was on the fence about planting gene-altered
seeds. ``Through last harvest I was very concerned,'' said
Dreckman, who now expects to plant genetically modified corn and
soybeans on 80 percent of his 1,200 acres. ``But what's changed my
mind is the elevators; if they weren't going to accept it, I
wouldn't plant it.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Scientifically altered seeds already account for huge parts of
the U.S. cotton, soybean and corn crops. But throughout the grain
belt, this year is shaping up as a test of the seed makers' resolve
to defend their products in the face of protests in Europe, where
imports of U.S. corn and soybeans have plummeted. If farmers
abandoned biotechnology seeds because of the protests, the
companies could lose billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the world's largest food producers have already shaken
things up by saying they will not use biotechnology crops this
year. McCain Foods Ltd. of Canada, a huge potato producer and a
leading supplier of French fries to Burger King, says it will steer
clear of gene-altered potatoes. The Frito-Lay unit of PepsiCo has
announced that it will not buy modified corn. And the Gerber
Products Co., going somewhat against the stance of its parent,
Novartis, has said that it will not use biotechnology crops in its
baby food.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't eliminate them out of safety concerns,'' said
Sheldon Jones, a spokesman at Gerber in Summit, N.J. ``We just
wanted to take baby food out of the debate; baby food is a very
sensitive area.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynn Markley, a Frito-Lay spokeswoman, added: ``It's all about
standing on the sidelines and waiting to see how consumers and the
FDA respond. Frito-Lay is not saying they are unsafe, and we are
not ruling out genetically modified products in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Farmers worry, however, that an increasing number of companies
will move away from genetically altered crops if fears spread among
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very concerned because the consumer is who we rely on,''
said Todd Gibson, 37, in Norborne, Mo., who was an early
biotechnology convert and says he will keep planting modified seed
as long as he can.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the technology say the regulatory approval process
is inadequate. They also question the safety of the food produced
and wonder about the effects to the environment in future
generations. The seeds are now used throughout North and South
America, China and Australia.
</P>
<P>
   No definitive studies have been done on the safety of
gene-altered foods, and protesters argue that more research is
needed.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, when American farms began shipping biotechnology crops
to Europe, exports of corn and soybeans, both genetically modified
and conventional, amounted to nearly $3 billion. But these
shipments have declined markedly, to about $1 billion last year.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, the trade in genetically altered seeds or foods has
virtually stopped: farmers won't plant biotechnology crops,
consumers won't buy the foods, and stores are declining to stock
them. Regulators have approved no new seed strains for nearly two
years.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, by contrast, the growth of gene-altered
corn and soybeans has exploded; almost a third of the corn crop and
about half the soybeans are produced from genetically altered
seeds.
</P>
<P>
   Biotechnology plantings in the United States increased to 62
million acres last year, from 16 million acres in 1997. This year,
the amount is expected to stay nearly flat, with more than 60
million acres of genetically engineered corn and soybeans planted,
according to the world's largest seed companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing a very stable market,'' said Carl Casale, a
spokesman at Monsanto, which is based in St. Louis. ``There's no
major step backward; it's now a matter of how much we'll grow.''
</P>
<P>
   Planting statistics are hard to come by so early in the farming
year, and some farm groups suspect the giant seed companies of
painting a overly rosy picture because they have so much riding on
this growing season. But interviews with more than two dozen
American farmers suggest that they are not drastically retreating
from biotechnology crops, partly because their share of the
European market is relatively small.
</P>
<P>
   About 80 percent of the corn and 60 percent of the soybeans
harvested in this country are used for domestic consumption and
animal feed, according to the Agriculture Department.
</P>
<P>
   At some of the nation's largest agriculture companies,
executives say it may be too late to turn back the clock on
genetically modified, or GM, crops; agriculture in the United
States is already geared toward producing large quantities of
biotechnology crops. Providing crops that are biotechnology-free
entails creating a more costly and cumbersome system to separate
the two kinds of produce, the executives say.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, ``the likelihood of commingling, we think, is very
high,'' said Lori Johnson, a spokeswoman at Cargill in Minneapolis.
``We tell customers we cannot guarantee 100 percent GM-free.''
</P>
<P>
   Some European food companies have asked for nonbiotechnology
crops this year, and the American grain handlers say they will try
their best.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you stopped right now, it'd take two years to get purity in
the system,'' said Gerald E. Smith, who farms about 2,200 acres in
Holstein, Iowa. ``There's an elevator in Nebraska looking for
non-GM. They want 98 percent purity, and they won't get it,'' he
said, because biotechnology crops are everywhere.

   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Smith says he is planting half his fields with gene-altered
seeds this year, down from 60 percent last year, just in case the
food companies change their minds. But he predicts that opposition
to biotechnology crops will eventually disappear.
</P>
<P>
   Curt Mowery, a farmer in Rosharon, Texas, agrees. ``I think a
lot of the fears are exaggerated,'' he said. ``In my mind, it's not
that much different from someone who gets a flu shot. They're using
a germ to immunize the corn.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Major farm organizations disagree over the future of
biotechnology plantings. Some say the seed companies _ which are
closely guarding preliminary planting statistics _ are playing down
farmer resistance and misrepresenting planting decisions farmers
have made.
</P>
<P>
   ``The companies are deceiving farmers into thinking their
neighbors are planting GM,'' said Gary Goldberg, the president of
the American Corn Growers Association, which predicts that
biotechnology corn plantings in the United States will decline as
much as 16 percent from last year.
</P>
<P>
   The National Corn Growers Association, a much larger trade
group, disputes those figures, saying that biotechnology corn
planting has slipped, but not drastically. They say the decline is
largely because of the reduced threat of the European corn borer, a
major pest of corn in the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of what farmers decide now, they still have a little
time to change their mind. If those who ordered biotechnology seed
get a sense that grain handlers are wavering, or major food
companies won't accept the crops, they can cancel their seed
orders.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole situation is in turmoil,'' said Kent Boyer, 51, a
farmer in North Platte, Neb., who says that some livestock
producers in his area are cutting back on the amounts of
gene-altered grain in what they feed their animals and that some
grain farmers are considering abandoning biotechnology seeds.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the Europeans continue to express their concern, that could
flow into the U.S.,'' he said. ``Ultimately, the consumer is going
to decide whether they're going to accept the technology.''

AUCTION FIRMS SAID TO SHARE CLIENT LISTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By RALPH BLUMENTHAL and CAROL VOGEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sotheby's and Christie's, the world's two most
powerful auction houses, swapped confidential lists of superrich
clients who were spared from paying fees charged to other sellers,
people close to the companies and to a federal antitrust
investigation of them said.
</P>
<P>
   The shared and overlapping lists of about 50 names, which
include some of the world's wealthiest families, were described as
a crucial tool for the auction houses to use in enforcing a form of
price control in which certain customers were charged lower
commissions, down to zero, that both houses honored. At the same
time, both houses charged identical rates, up to 20 percent, to
other sellers who had little chance of negotiation.
</P>
<P>
   The unusual collaboration by the two longtime archrivals,
lawyers said, could figure into a prosecution for possible
price-fixing and other collusive practices under study by the
Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called grandfathered lists, as they were known at
Christie's and Sotheby's, were compiled separately by the two
companies and closely held by top executives. But in 1995, with the
art market in the doldrums, the two hard-pressed houses set new
sellers' commissions, which were higher and identical, generating
more income and leaving customers little room for bargaining.
According to closely matching accounts, they then shared the lists
of preferred customers so that they would each respect the other's
special deals and not cut new ones with people who were not named.
Because well-heeled sellers often converse with both houses and
many dealers, a low rate that was not recorded on the list could
easily be tracked through art world gossip, providing the houses
with a check on each other. Yet the two still sometimes breached
their agreements and betrayed each other, people close to the
companies said.
</P>
<P>
   At least five people with different links to both auction houses
and the investigation confirmed the list-sharing arrangement but,
citing the investigation, spoke only on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The identities of those on the lists were not disclosed, but
generally, those familiar with the lists said, the bigger the
seller, the lower the commission, down in many cases to zero.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   One former auction house official said that just before the
higher new sellers' commission went into effect, the company asked
top experts to compile a list of preferred clients to be
``grandfathered'' with lower fees.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, the same former executive said, the beneficiaries
were then pressed to sell their goods through that auction house,
as a way of guaranteeing their presence on the preferred list.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the lists were physically traded or just the names
exchanged was not spelled out.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   One person involved in a civil lawsuit against Christie's and
Sotheby's cited the account of a seller who told of approaching one
house or the other seeking, in vain, to negotiate a lower fee.
</P>
<P>
   The customer then threatened to go to the rival house, only to
be told, ``You can go but you won't get anything better.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the lists, spokesmen for Christie's and Sotheby's
said Thursday that they would have no comment during the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The existence and sharing of customer lists was not mentioned in
an expanded complaint filed late Wednesday in Federal District
Court in Manhattan on behalf of a large group of buyers and sellers
who are suing Sotheby's and Christie's claiming that collusive
practices going back to at least 1993 cheated customers of untold
sums.
</P>
<P>
   The companies have not yet responded in court but are expected
to do so in coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The amended complaint, adding new details to previous
allegations, contended that in 1995, after both companies had
already fixed buyers' premiums, Sotheby's chairman and major
stockholder, A. Alfred Taubman, sought to extend the collusion to
sellers' fees in secret meetings with Christie's chairman, Sir
Anthony Tennant, and its chief executive, Christopher M. Davidge.
The complaint also contended that Sotheby's president, Diana D.
Brooks, held secret meetings in New York with a Christie's
counterpart, whom others have identified as Davidge. Brooks, others
have said, also traveled to London to meet with Christie's
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Linklater, a Chicago lawyer representing Davidge, and
Stephen E. Kaufman, a Manhattan lawyer retained by Brooks, said
they would have no comment.
</P>
<P>
   For three years Federal antitrust prosecutors have been
questioning a wide array of art world figures about possible
price-fixing and collusion in the famously secretive multibillion
dollar art world.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   People close to the investigation said the Justice Department
has been given notes of phone conversations between Taubman of
Sotheby's and Tennant of Christie's.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the prosecutors' questions, those who have been
contacted also say, involve regular meetings that took place
between the two auction giants and whether any matters discussed
raise antitrust issues.
</P>
<P>
   At least once, sometimes twice a year, employees from Sotheby's
and Christie's met to coordinate their sales schedules. Top-level
officials also met to discuss the possibility of holding auctions
in Paris, a market that has been closed to non-French auctioneers
for hundreds of years.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The preferred customer lists were compiled in 1995 when
Christie's announced it was changing the fee it charged sellers
from a flat commission of 10 percent to a more complex,
nonnegotiable sliding scale ranging from 2 percent to 20 percent
depending on the size of the sale. Weeks later Sotheby's did the
same.
</P>
<P>
   Three years before the seller's fees were changed, Sotheby's
announced an increase in the buyer's commission, up from a flat fee
of 10 percent. Seven weeks later Christie's followed suit.
</P>
<P>
   Collusion in setting either or both of these commissions would
constitute an illegal restraint of trade under the Sherman
Antitrust Act. Penalties for violations can include substantial
fines and imprisonment of up to three years.

   The companies, which control about 95 percent of the $4 billion
worldwide auction market, are facing more than 40 class-action law
suits filed against them by disgruntled buyers and sellers who
charge that they were victimized by collusion. And because
Sotheby's is a public company, unlike Christie's, it has been hit
with several shareholder lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 24, Davidge abruptly resigned from Christie's, and
Taubman resigned as chairman and Brooks as president of Sotheby's
on Feb. 21. All three have turned away repeated requests for

RANGERS SEND STEVENS TO EXPOS IN THREE-WAY DEAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUNEDIN, Fla. _ Willing to trade power for fewer strikeouts and
a higher on-base percentage, the Rangers sent Lee Stevens to the
Montreal Expos on Thursday and acquired David Segui from the
Toronto Blue Jays.
</P>
<P>
   To complete the three-team deal of first basemen/designated
hitters, the Expos sent Brad Fullmer to the Blue Jays.
</P>
<P>
   ``David Segui is a better fit for our lineup,'' Rangers general
manager Doug Melvin said. ``That's what this trade comes down to.
We just felt David's able to put the ball in play a little more and
have a little better on-base percentage.''
</P>
<P>
   Melvin said the trade had nothing to do with Stevens' salary
arbitration case last month, and the financial considerations of
the deal support that. Stevens is signed for $3.5 million, while
Segui is signed for $4,325,000. To make up the difference, the Blue
Jays are paying the Rangers $825,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very tough,'' said Stevens, who was told of the trade
during the Rangers' 6-2 exhibition loss to the Blue Jays on
Thursday. ``I've been with this team a long time, more than any
other place. It feels like home. I've made a lot of friends here.
It's going to be tough.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers liked Stevens' power but were concerned about his
high number of strikeouts. Stevens struck out 132 times in 517
at-bats last season. Segui's career high is 80 strikeouts in 522
at-bats in 1998 while with the Seattle Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   Segui, a switch hitter, has a career on-base percentage of .352
compared with .319 for Stevens. But Stevens, who hit 24 home runs
and had 81 runs batted in last year, has a .453 career slugging
percentage compared with .436 for Segui.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Johnny Oates said he plans to bat Segui fifth in the
lineup behind Rafael Palmeiro and ahead of Ruben Mateo and Gabe
Kapler.
</P>
<P>
   ``Batting behind Raffy, he could drive in a lot of runs,'' Oates
said. ``When Lee's in one of his streaks, he can drive in a lot of
runs. But we wanted to get away from the strikeouts and make sure
we got someone who would put the ball in play.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Oates said, ``When you trade someone like Lee Stevens,
you don't get overly excited. He was always ready to play. The way
he went about his business, it was a pleasure for a manager.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason was that Stevens accepted his role as a designated
hitter even though he wanted to play first base. Segui, 33, found
himself in a similar position when he was acquired by the Blue Jays
on July 28 last year and wasn't happy about having to DH while
Carlos Delgado played first.
</P>
<P>
   Segui, who is expected to report to the Rangers on Saturday,
could not be reached for comment Thursday. Because he was a free
agent in the off-season and free agents can't be traded until after
June 1, Segui had to give his permission to be traded to the
Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Rafael Palmeiro is the Rangers' regular first baseman but is
still having occasional trouble with his right knee. Palmeiro
underwent two operations on the knee last year and was forced to
play all but 28 games at designated hitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``David will play some first base for us,'' Oates said. ``How
much, I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   But Oates insisted Palmeiro's health had nothing to do with the
trade, pointing out that both Stevens and Segui are excellent
defensive players.
</P>
<P>
   From that standpoint, Stevens comes out ahead because he'll get
a chance to be the Expos' regular first baseman. But he'll be going
from a division champion to a team that was 68-94 last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough when you go from a club like this,'' Stevens said.
``Hopefully, I can help (the Expos) win a few more ballgames.
Nobody likes to finish last. They're trying to do something about
it; maybe I can be part of something special.''
DAVID SEGUI BIO Age: 33 Height: 6-1. Weight: 202 Bats: Both Throws:
Left
</P>
<P>
   CONTRACT: Makes $4,325,000 this season and is eligible for free
agency. Was eligible after last season but, after the New York Mets
signed Todd Zeile, found that nobody needed a first baseman.
Instead he accepted the Blue Jays' offer of salary arbitration.
</P>
<P>
   PERSONAL: Son of former major-league pitcher Diego Segui.
Drafted by the Baltimore Orioles in the 18th round of the 1987 June
amateur draft. Played for manager Johnny Oates from 1991-93 while
with the Orioles. This is his 11th major-league season and the
Rangers will be his sixth team.
</P>
<P>
   STATISTICS: Segui, a switch hitter, has a career batting average
of .285, including .282 against left-handers and .286 against
right-handers. He has 102 career homers, including a high of 21
with Montreal in 1997. He has hit .300 or better in three of his
past five seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ANALYTICAL: The Rangers like Segui because he puts the ball in
play and doesn't strike out nearly as often as Stevens. He had a
career high 80 strikeouts in 522 at-bats in 1998, a relatively low
total for a first baseman. But his career-high slugging percentage
is .505, which is low for a first baseman. Segui also prefers to
play first base but will have to adjust to being a regular
designated hitter behind Rafael Palmeiro. nn

TEXAS TECH GETS EARLY EDGE WITH TOP-SEED SPOILS
</HEADLINE>
 TECH-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF CAPLAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Think of the advantage if Duke played the first two rounds of
the men's NCAA Tournament inside the crazed confines of Cameron
Indoor Stadium. North Carolina in the Dean Dome. Arizona in the
McKale Center. Syracuse in the Carrier Dome.
</P>
<P>
   Pass Go, advance to Sweet 16 Parkway, collect $200.
</P>
<P>
   That's the advantage awarded to Texas Tech and the 15 other
top-seeded teams in the women's NCAA Tournament, which starts
Friday. Devised years ago to ensure larger crowds in the early
rounds, the top 16 seeds play host to four-team subregional
tournaments. In Lubbock, same as in Knoxville, Tenn., Storrs,
Conn., and other women's basketball havens, it's similar to feeding
the visitors to the lions.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Tech will get to show off its new United Spirit Arena. Its
24 luxury skyboxes are a nice touch, but the real charm of the
place is it packs in 15,000 frenzied fans. The Lady Raiders average
nearly 13,000 fans a game for the regular season, and the school
estimates it'll have close to capacity crowds for each of the three
tournament games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever you have 12,000 people rooting for you and only for
you, of course, that's going to get your adrenaline pumping,''
senior forward Aleah Johnson said. ``We just love playing at home,
we love it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mideast Region's No. 14-seed Tennessee Tech (24-8) will be
the first to find out how much at 8:30 p.m. tomorrow when it faces
the 25-4 Lady Raiders, the No. 3 seed. No. 6 Tulane will face No.
11 Vermont in the early game at 6 p.m. The winners will meet at
8:05 p.m. on Monday with the victor advancing to the Mideast
Regional _ the Sweet 16 _ at The Pyramid in Memphis, Tenn., a
neutral site.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're real excited to put that kind of crowd in here and share
the first two rounds of the tournament with our fans,'' Tech coach
Marsha Sharp said. ``We're undefeated here, so we hope it can stay
that way two more games.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1992, Texas Tech is 11-1 in tournament games played in
Lubbock, until this year at the old Municipal Stadium. This is the
third consecutive year, and eight of nine, that Tech will have
played host to early-round tournament games.
</P>
<P>
   The Lady Raiders are 14-0 at home this season, winning by an
average of 23.2 points.
</P>
<P>
   So, should the strongest teams receive home-court advantage in a
64-team tournament? The NCAA is tinkering with changes. Sharp said
a proposal has been made to have early-round games at
``predetermined sites'' with schools bidding to get the game by
guaranteeing ticket sales.
</P>
<P>
   Vermont coach Mike Cieplicki, whose team will travel more than
2,000 miles and will stretch its athletic department's budget by
spending $1,943 per person for a round-trip ticket to play in
Lubbock, said he'd rather make the logistic nightmare of a trip
than have revenue potential become an influential factor in
determining host sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, there is a significant advantage for the host, but
if part of that is earned, which it is in the NCAA Tournament, then
that's a little more fair,'' he said. ``If it just comes down to
which city happens to get the cheapest hotels so they can get a
better bid, then that's where I struggle more in the fairness.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharp and Cieplicki believe eventually tournament games will be
played at neutral sites as women's basketball continues to grow.
Until then, Sharp will have her team ready to play and have fun
showing off their new arena _ and likely use it as a springboard to
the Sweet 16. nn

SINGH IS HOPING RIVALS BRING OUT HIS BEST
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ More than a year has passed since Vijay Singh's
last victory. And for a player of Singh's caliber, a year between
victories seems like a very long time.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I don't win, then it's a disappointing season for me,''
said Singh, whose last victory was at the Honda Classic in March
1999. ``I'm eager to win again. That's my next goal, to win a golf
tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   Singh may reach that goal this weekend if he continues to play
like he did Thursday. Overcoming bogeys on his first two holes,
Singh finished with a 4-under 68 to tie Duffy Waldorf for first
place after the opening round of the Bay Hill Invitational. Tiger
Woods was one stroke off the lead at 69, tied for third place with
Brent Geiberger, Paul Goydos, Dudley Hart, Jonathan Kaye, Mike
Nicolette and David Toms. Hart won the Honda Classic last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   For Singh, a victory this week would be the best way to prepare
for The Players Championship next week and the Masters next month.
Like all of the world's top players, Singh has reached the point
where he no longer worries about making money or finishing in the
top 10. He is ranked No. 6 in the world, he finished fourth on the
PGA Tour's money list last year and he has finished no lower than
17th on the money list in every year since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   At age 37, winning is what really matters to Singh, and he hopes
to capitalize on this week's opportunity. Singh had an excellent
chance to win last month at Pebble Beach, when he entered the final
round one stroke off the lead. But after falling five strokes
behind on the back nine, Singh lost his concentration, figuring he
had no chance to win. Instead, Matt Gogel stumbled on the back nine
and Woods made a miraculous comeback, overcoming a seven-stroke
deficit with seven holes to play to win his sixth consecutive tour
start. Singh settled for a second-place tie, and he admitted that
he learned a lesson.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had played all the hard holes, I didn't think he was going
to mess up,'' Singh said of Gogel. ``But he came back to the field,
I made one or two bogeys and Tiger made a bunch of birdies going
in. I had a good chance if I kept playing. I gave up a little bit
when I bogeyed No. 14, but I shouldn't have stopped.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who stops making birdies this weekend may be overtaken by
Woods again. Woods looked fresh and sharp after his two-week break,
in a round that included five birdies and two bogeys. Singh would
love to triumph over a field that includes 12 of the top 16 players
in the world rankings. With Arnold Palmer as the host, Bay Hill
always attracts a strong field. Singh hopes the competition brings
out his best. ``Before the tournament starts, you kind of look at
the list and see who's playing and who's not,'' Singh said. ``The
field is strong. But once we tee it up, we don't' worry about who's
playing. We worry about our own game.''  &QL;

   In a Look at Low Taxes, High Marks for Wyoming &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you want to hold onto as much of your money as possible, move
to Wyoming, advises Bloomberg Personal Finance magazine, which
recently measured the tax bite of each state and the District of
Columbia for four hypothetical families.
</P>
<P>
   Wyoming took the daintiest of nibbles, and was given an A(plus)
in the survey, to be published in the April issue. The state was
ranked first, both over all and in the area of retirement taxation.
Rhode Island chowed down on taxpayers, ranking 51st in both
categories, according to the survey; its grade was F. But the state
had company in the Northeast. New York was 49th over all, Vermont
46th, Maine 45th and Washington, D.C., 42nd.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Wyoming, states in the wealth-friendly top 10 were
Nevada, Washington, Tennessee, Alaska, Florida, Louisiana, South
Dakota, Texas and Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he was heading for Laramie, Steve Gittelson, the
magazine's editor, laughed. ``My sister moved out there,'' he said,
``and I think she made a smart move, but she didn't do it for that
reason.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's more to life than taxes,'' added Gittelson, whose
office is in Princeton, N.J. Still, wealth-friendliness could be a
factor in deciding where to live, he said, especially as
telecommuting lets more people work wherever they choose.
</P>
<P>
   Montanans, for example, might want to move to Wyoming. Their
state ranked 50th in both categories. Other states in the bottom 10
over all were Nebraska, 43rd; Oregon, 44th; Wisconsin, 47th; and
Minnesota, 48th.
</P>
<P>
   A surprise in the survey was Massachusetts, which may be
shedding its ``Taxachusetts'' moniker. It ranked 35th overall and
41st for retirement. Its grade was C(minus). &QL;

UNARMED MAN IS SHOT TO DEATH IN SCUFFLE WITH 3 UNDERCOVER
DETECTIVES 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By WILLIAM K. RASHBAUM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ An unarmed Brooklyn man was shot and killed outside a
bar on Eighth Avenue in Midtown Manhattan early Thursday in a
scuffle with three undercover narcotics detectives, the authorities
said.
</P>
<P>
   The details of the shooting were sketchy Thursday night, and
there were conflicting accounts of the episode, but a senior
investigator and a man who saw the scuffle said the dead man,
Patrick M. Dorismond, 26, who worked as a security guard for the
34th Street Partnership, was angered when one of the undercover
detectives approached him and asked to buy drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The witness, Kevin Kaiser, a co-worker of Dorismond's, said he
and Dorismond had not known that the detectives _ all in plain
clothes _ who approached them were the police. Deputy Chief Thomas
Fahey, a police spokesman, acknowledged that the police ``have no
indication'' whether Dorismond knew.
</P>
<P>
   But a lawyer for the detective who fired the fatal shot, Anthony
Vasquez, 29, said his client yelled ``Police!'' after the scuffle
began and before the shot was fired.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear whether Vasquez fired intentionally or by
accident. The shooting is being investigated by the department's
Internal Affairs Bureau and by the Manhattan district attorney,
Robert Morgenthau.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting was the third in 13 months in which plainclothes
officers shot and killed an unarmed man. It came just as tensions
that rose with the acquittal of four officers in the shooting of
Amadou Diallo and another fatal shooting by police a week later had
begun to ebb.
</P>
<P>
   Like the earlier two incidents, this shooting involved a black
victim.
</P>
<P>
   Police Commissioner Howard Safir provided few details Thursday
afternoon about the shooting or the events that led up to it, and
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, speaking with reporters, urged the news
media not to judge the officers before all the evidence is
available.
</P>
<P>
   The confrontation began about 12:30 a.m. outside the Wakamba
Cocktail Lounge at 543 Eighth Ave., near 37th Street. Since his
shift had ended at 11 p.m., Dorismond had been drinking beer there
with Kaiser and six tourists from Chile, according to a senior
investigator and Kaiser.
</P>
<P>
   The two security guards, who had changed into street clothes
after work, were waiting for a taxi when the undercover detective
approached and asked if they knew where he could buy marijuana,
according to a senior police official, who said that the detective
thought he could buy some from Dorismond.
</P>
<P>
   Angry words were exchanged, a scuffle erupted and the two backup
detectives came to the aide of the undercover detective.
</P>
<P>
   Vasquez, who was one of the backup officers, known as ghosts in
police parlance because they shadow the undercover officer to
protect him, shot Dorismond once in the chest from close range. The
detectives, who had made eight marijuana arrests earlier in the
evening, were all assigned to the Gang Investigation Division's
narcotics unit.
</P>
<P>
   The confrontation itself was quick and chaotic, according to
investigators and police officials, and early reports of the
shooting that indicated that the officer had shot a man who had
tried to rob him were inaccurate, officials and investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   While Kaiser's account and that of the police are similar up
until the scuffle, Kaiser said the officer first took a swing at
Dorismond and the senior police official said Dorismond struck
first.
</P>
<P>
   The senior investigator said that several other people witnessed
the shooting and the events that preceded it, including an employee
inside the Wakamba. The investigator said that their accounts were
all similar to Kaiser's.
</P>
<P>
   The undercover detective and the second backup detective, whose
names were not released by the Police Department, told
investigators that they believed the scuffling was over when the
shot rang out, but they did not see the shot fired and did not know
whether Vasquez fired intentionally or accidentally.
</P>
<P>
   The detectives were in the area because the police believe it is
frequented by Bloods gang members.
</P>
<P>
   Morganthau's office will present the shooting to a grand jury, a
practice that is standard in such police shootings.

NASA'S RELIANCE ON RUSSIA QUESTIONED 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By PATTY REINERT 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House budget writers, who have long criticized the
Clinton administration's reliance on Russia to complete the
International Space Station, questioned Thursday whether NASA
officials have compromised the station's safety by accepting
Russia's faulty work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is NASA lowering safety standards in order for Russia to
participate?'' asked Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calif., chairman of
the House Space and Aeronautics Subcommittee. ``I am very concerned
that the administration has been bending over so far backward to
keep Russia involved that they may have jeopardized safety.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Rothenberg, associate administrator for NASA's human
spaceflight program, assured committee members that Russia has met
all the major safety standards and is working to fix any remaining
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not treating the Russians any differently than our own
civil servants and contractors,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The questions came during a subcommittee hearing on the human
spaceflight program's $5.5 billion budget request for fiscal year
2001.
</P>
<P>
   Also testifying was Allen Li, associate director of the General
Accounting Office's National Security and International Affairs
Division, who was asked to review Russia's compliance with safety
requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Li, whose final report on the issue is expected next month,
agreed that Russia has done a good job for the most part, but he
outlined some safety concerns:
</P>
<P>
   _ The station's Russian-built service module, also known as the
crew module _ which is critical to life-support, propulsion and
power generation _ does not have adequate shielding to protect it
from orbiting debris.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Zarya, a Russian component launched in 1998, and the
service module, which is to be launched this summer, will not be
able to operate if cabin pressure is lost.
</P>
<P>
   _ The service module's window design has not been approved.
</P>
<P>
   _ Excessive noise levels in Zarya and the service module could
result in permanent hearing damage to the crew.
</P>
<P>
   Li and Rothenberg said the problems can be resolved, even after
the components have been launched. For example, plans are already
under way to improve the service module's shielding in orbit
because if additional shielding were added before launch, the
module would be too heavy for lift-off.
</P>
<P>
   The most cumbersome problem, it seems, may be that the first
crew aboard the space station may have to wear some type of ear
muff to protect their hearing until they can install additional
insulation.
</P>
<P>
   NASA officials are concerned that crew members won't wear the
uncomfortable ear protection and that if they do wear them, they
might not be able to hear caution and warning signals in the event
of an emergency.
</P>
<P>
   When completed in 2005, the space station will provide research
facilities for a permanent crew of seven. The station, which
involves 16 nations, is a crucial first step in launching an
eventual human mission to Mars, and also is expected to aid medical
and scientific research on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the National Research Council urged NASA to
consider paying financially ailing Russia for equipment and
services the country had once promised to donate to the U.S.-led
international space station.

<P>
   ATLANTA _ If only Lt. Columbo were here, investigating the
murder of JonBenet Ramsey.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, we are a nation of armchair Columbos, always turning
and asking just one more question, but with the truth as elusive as
ever.
</P>
<P>
   The maw of television opens wide again, the Internet
hyperventilates with invective, the whodunit rattles our national
cage.
</P>
<P>
   ``This story has moved beyond something that is merely
newsworthy to become a communal event, an experience,'' says
Matthew R. Kerbel, author of ``If It Bleeds, It Leads,'' a new book
that presents a scorching analysis of television news.
</P>
<P>
   Today marks a peak, if not in actual news, then in the communal
event that is our fascination with the Ramsey case. John and Patsy
Ramsey's book, ``The Death of Innocence'' (Thomas Nelson Inc.,
$24.99) goes on sale today, with a first printing of 300,000 copies
(several bookstores around the country jumped the gun, claiming to
be unaware of the publisher's embargo). At 10 tonight, ABC airs a
Barbara Walters interview with the Ramseys on ``20/20.''
</P>
<P>
   The publicity drumbeat continues next week with a live Internet
chat with the Ramseys at 10 p.m. Monday on the Web site ABC.com; a
five-part interview with Katie Couric on NBC's ``Today'' show; and
then a March 27 appearance on ``Larry King Live.'' The true
newsworthiness of any of these interviews is debatable; the Ramseys
say exactly what they said on CNN on Jan. 1, 1997, and on a British
documentary that ran on A&AMP;E in 1998: that they are innocent, that
they did not kill their 6-year-old daughter on Dec. 26, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``The audience loves it, and I'm curious to a point, but there's
got to be something new,'' CNN's King said in January. ``I don't
think there's been any real development in the last 12 shows we've
done.''
</P>
<P>
   The book publication and media blitz are new, but that's not
necessarily the same as being news.
</P>
<P>
   The very notion of ``news'' in the Ramsey case has been
slippery, as the level of journalism has been a shocking mixture of
laziness and aggressiveness resulting in a blur of misinformation
and misleading leaks that surpasses even Clinton-Lewinsky, along
with the usual speculation, blind alleys and ax-grinding.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm amazed that the whole world doesn't think we're guilty,
given what they've been told,'' John Ramsey tells Walters in
tonight's interview. And, indeed, many do think that he, his wife
or both are guilty and see their book and the well-orchestrated TV
appearances as a cynical manipulation. But many others see the
Ramseys as innocent, unjustly persecuted by a Boulder, Colo.,
police force that rushed to judgment and by a ravenous media in
which distinctions between tabloid and mainstream journalism no
longer hold.
</P>
<P>
   The book itself, ``The Death of Innocence'' _ the 10th book
about the case _ is 396 grueling pages in which the Ramseys
describe the last three years and three months in detail, outline
the case that an intruder killed JonBenet and wreak extended
vengeance on the Boulder police and the national media. Although
the supermarket tabloid The Globe draws their strongest criticism
(Geraldo Rivera is second), they also jab at CNN, citing their
devastation when they heard former talk show host Mary Tillotson
say that JonBenet looked like ``a hooker'' when she dressed for
child beauty pageants. They refer to MSNBC (the cable venture of
NBC and Microsoft) as ``the video tabloid brought to us by Bill
Gates and GE.'' (General Electric owns NBC.)
</P>
<P>
   But frequently in ``The Death of Innocence,'' the media are just
an undifferentiated mob, a perpetual stalking machine both in
Colorado and in Atlanta, where the Ramseys now live.
</P>
<P>
   They turned down nearly all interview requests; ``we did not
feel obligated to fill their time slots with macabre
entertainment,'' they write.
</P>
<P>
   TOUGH BUT NOT VICIOUS
</P>
<P>
   Now, of course, there is no other way to publicize their book
than to present themselves as ``macabre entertainment'' in the
media they despise. Thomas Nelson, a Nashville, Tenn., Christian
publishing house, set up the carefully calibrated appearances on
the couple's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted these interviews to air when the book is in
bookstores,'' says Jeff Zucker, executive producer of ``Today.''
``If we hadn't agreed, they wouldn't have taped it.'' So Couric
interviewed the Ramseys in late February, as did Walters, and their
news organizations agreed in advance not to air the interviews
until the book's release.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not unique,'' says Zucker. ``We've seen this on other
books of major interest; Colin Powell's book comes to mind.''
</P>
<P>
   If this extended dance is indeed about news, it's just as much
about promotion. But as author Kerbel notes, ``The public creates
the demand; the media feeds the demand.''
</P>
<P>
   On ``20/20'' tonight, Walters is tough but not vicious,
definitely not in her supersympathetic mode. She tells the couple
that to many people, the videos of JonBenet in beauty pageants look
``perverted.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That didn't come from JonBenet; that came from the viewer,''
Patsy responds.
</P>
<P>
   Walters also reviews the evidence that an intruder killed
JonBenet (as does the current Newsweek), but the show is aimed more
at casual followers of the case than the hard-core obsessives.
</P>
<P>
   For the latter, the Internet is the medium of choice. The Ramsey
case is unmeasurably huge in cyberspace. One popular Web page lists
118 links to the case, and each link leads to countless more. Susan
Bennett, a North Carolina homemaker whose Internet site led to her
becoming friends with the Ramseys, being questioned by police and
being threatened by Internet crazies, has a time line of the case
that runs more than 3,000 printed pages. She also runs one of the
many Internet forums, where thousands of people speculate endlessly
(and sometimes mindlessly) about the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a hobby for some,'' says Bennett. ``Some are there
because they really care about JonBenet; some are there because
their lives are lacking something.'' She agrees with the notion
that many, but not all, Ramsey case fanatics are armchair
detectives, sifting through the clues in an effort to solve the
case.
</P>
<P>
   A REAL-LIFE WHODUNIT NOVEL
</P>
<P>
   While Bennett's site is independent but pro-Ramsey, other sites
argue so strongly for the guilt of one or both parents that an
Internet acronym was coined, based on a ``Star Trek'' alien race:
BORG, for ``Bent On Ramsey Guilt.'' Even the sleaziest print and
broadcast media outposts have at least some standards _ fear of
libel, if nothing else _ but the Ramsey obsessives on the Net, many
of whom post using anonymous names, are completely unfettered. They
attack the Ramseys, the police, the district attorney and one
another.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Patsy and I have lived through might go down in history
as the first cyberspace lynching,'' John Ramsey declares in
``Innocence.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What you have here is the blurring of the line between reality
and fiction,'' says Kerbel. ``A real murder happened. People then
latched onto the mystery of it, the celebrity, and became
captivated by it, as if it was a whodunit novel.'' This one,
though, had more clues than any self-respecting ``Columbo'' would
ever allow: the bizarre ransom note, the stun gun, the DNA, the
garotte, the duct tape, the shoeprint, the snow outside the house
(or lack of it).
</P>
<P>
   ``So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back
ceaselessly into the past.'' F. Scott Fitzgerald closed his novel
``The Great Gatsby'' with that line 75 years ago. Now it describes
us all: the media talking heads, the cybersleuths, even the Ramseys
themselves. The nature of modern news, with every day a new cycle,
makes it seem as if we're moving forward. But we really just keep
going back, and going back, trying to figure it out.

   A CHALLENGER FOR KENNEDY
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts has accumulated a hefty
$3.6 million in his re-election fund. And that money, along with
the Kennedy name and 36 years of incumbency, were enough Thursday
to scare off one potential Republican foe, District Attorney
Michael Sullivan of Plymouth County.
</P>
<P>
   But no sooner had Sullivan said that he would not run than
another Republican, Jack E. Robinson III, announced that he would
take on the senator. In fact, Robinson, a 39-year-old cell phone
entrepreneur, said he planned to use up to $1 million of his own
money to run.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's absolutely a long shot,'' he conceded. ``We're the
underdog. But at the end of the day, ideas are going to win out.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, a Boston-born African-American whose father once
headed the city's NAACP chapter, is seeking to be the third
popularly elected African-American senator since the Civil War. He
has never held political office. But state Republican leaders see
him as the party's last best hope as a Kennedy challenger, in part
because the state has a strong civil rights record but also because
they believe his fiscally conservative, socially moderate approach
to politics, including support for abortion rights, will appeal to
a broad spectrum of Massachusetts voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to be reaching out not only to Republicans, but to
Democrats and independents as well,'' said John Brockelman,
executive director of the Massachusetts Republican Party. ``He's
going to run under the Republican reform banner.''
</P>
<P>
   PUSH FOR UNION CANDIDATES
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ John J. Sweeney, the AFL-CIO president, came to New
York Thursday to promote an ambitious effort by big labor to have
at least 2,000 union members run for office nationwide this year,
from campaigns for school boards to campaigns for Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Too many of the nation's elected officials, he said, come from
big wealth, with at least 1 of every 4 members of Congress being a
millionaire. But, he declared at a news conference, big labor's
``2,000 in 2000'' program would help rectify that by ensuring that
the voices of the less well off were represented in the halls of
power.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our program,'' Sweeney said, ``aims to change the face of
elected America and make sure working families' voices are heard by
running union members for office.''
</P>
<P>
   BUSH APPOINTEES AND MESSAGE WIN
</P>
<P>
   Two of Gov. George W. Bush's minority appointees won Republican
primaries in Texas on Tuesday, giving a boost to his effort to make
his party more inclusive in the Lone Star state and also providing
some underpinning to his assertion that as president he would be an
inclusive leader.
</P>
<P>
   Neither faces Democratic opposition in the fall, so both are
assured final victory.
</P>
<P>
   They are Michael Williams, who won election to the Texas
Railroad Commission in his own right, having earlier been given an
interim appointment by the governor, and Al Gonzales, who won a
seat on the state Supreme Court in his own right after an interim
appointment by the governor.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who served earlier as Bush's secretary of state, is an
African-American, the first ever to win a nonjudicial statewide
election in Texas. Gonzales is Latino.
</P>
<P>
   During the campaign, Bush appeared in television commercials
supporting both.

MONEY, MONEY, MONEY. GUILT, GUILT, GUILT.  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 19) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Colo., Calif.)   (af)  
 By ABBY ELLIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every day, I thank God that I'm not an Internet billionaire,
that my last name isn't Kennedy or Rockefeller and that no one is
paying me $20 million to star in a movie. After all, if I were
worth an outrageous amount of money, who knows the trauma that
would await?
</P>
<P>
   At a minimum, I'd be paralyzed by choices, smothered by
possibilities. According to the Forum for Investor Advice, only 42
percent of people who come into large sums initially react with
happiness or excitement; one in four express anxiety or numbness,
even guilt. Emile Durkheim, the French sociologist, thought
unexpected wealth could lead to suicide.
</P>
<P>
   With luck, before I ever reached that point I'd find a fiscal
therapist, someone well-versed in the malaise that practitioners
call ``affluenza'' or ``sudden wealth syndrome.''
</P>
<P>
   Trust-fund children and lottery or game-show winners have the
hardest time; they didn't work for their money, ``so there's a
disparity between their net worth and self-worth,'' said Myra
Salzer, president of the Wealth Conservancy, a financial planning
firm in Boulder, Colo., dedicated to helping heirs ``integrate with
and take control over'' their wealth. Her fee is a percentage of
the client's assets, with a minimum of $5,000 a quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``My clients tend to be young, and they feel guilty and
undeserving,'' she said. ``They've almost been denied an
opportunity to see what they can do for themselves. So their goal
in life is not to screw up their money, as opposed to seeing what
they can build for themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   To help, she conducts a four-day seminar called ``Inherited
Wealth and You'' twice a year in Aspen. Scions gather to lament
their riches in a ``safe place where it's OK to talk about money
and put it into perspective.'' Salzer is not advocating that anyone
feel sorry for young heirs, but she does think that they need an
arena where they can be who they are. For $1,475 (plus hotel and
air fare), she provides it.
</P>
<P>
   Things are a little different in Silicon Valley where more than
60 new millionaires are said to be minted each day. Because
Internet millionaires, like celebrities, tend to have worked in
some manner for their money, most feel more entitled to it than do
those who inherited their wealth. Still, many can't handle it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Money used to be called the root of evil; now it's the root of
stress and confusion,'' said Dr. Stephen Goldbart, a
psychotherapist and co-founder of the Money, Meaning and Choices
Institute in San Francisco. ``Many of the dot-commers had no idea
that at such a young age they'd have enough money they'd no longer
have to work. They buy two or three houses, a car, spend money on
stuff. And when that hasn't done it for them, they become
depressed, empty and uncertain about what to do with their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldbart and his co-director, Joan DiFuria, came up with the
term ``sudden wealth syndrome'' to describe a condition in which
people with quick riches isolate themselves, become obsessed with
the stock market and feel embarrassed, scared and unable to accept
that the money is really theirs.
</P>
<P>
   ``SWS triggers a massive identity crisis, an early midlife
crisis,'' Goldbart said.
</P>
<P>
   The recovery process has three stages: recognizing the impact of
the wealth on one's life, regaining control of one's life and
coming up with a new set of priorities and goals.
</P>
<P>
   Like Salzer, Goldbart doesn't believe that we should feel sorry
for the very rich, but that we do need to acknowledge their issues.
``Think about it,'' he said. ``What would you do if you suddenly
had $35 million?''
</P>
<P>
   I didn't have an immediate answer. But after some pondering, I
decided I would dedicate the rest of my life to helping others in
similar situations. I'd open a soup kitchen for those so
immobilized by their riches that they were unable to order in. I'd
hold bake sales and give the proceeds to the ``Money Doesn't Buy
Happiness'' Foundation. It would be tough, but I'd take it one day
at a time and, somehow, find the inner strength and power to cope. &QL;

RARE METEORITE COULD TELL HOW SUN, PLANETS FORMED 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK CARREAU 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Fragments of a rare form of meteorite that made a
spectacular landfall in the frozen wilderness of Canada's northern
Rocky Mountains earlier this year may hold important new clues
about the materials that formed the sun and the planets, scientists
at NASA's Johnson Space Center said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   There is a high likelihood the secrets locked within space rocks
have been preserved by uninterrupted cold since well before the
solar system was formed an estimated 4.5 billion years ago, said
Michael Zolensky, a NASA cosmic mineralogist.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my career this will be the only time this happens,'' said
an elated Zolensky, as he displayed a sample at the Lunar and
Planetary Science Conference under way at Johnson Space Center this
week.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers are hopeful that as the fragments are cut into
sections and examined with electron microscopes and other high-tech
instruments, they will reveal the presence of amino acids, some of
the most critical building blocks of life, and other complex
chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   The findings could help scientists determine whether the water
on the Earth and the chemical precursors for life arrived within
the meteorites and comets that theorists believe bombarded the
Earth and the other planets for hundreds of millions of years after
the formation of the solar system.
</P>
<P>
   The fragments were recovered from the snow and ice without
contamination from human touch, thanks to the efforts of alert
Canadian authorities and the scientifically minded citizen of
British Columbia who found the first charred pieces of the
meteorite.
</P>
<P>
   Carefully preserved in a freezer, a dozen small pieces of the
find were flown to the contamination-free laboratories of the Earth
Sciences and Solar System Exploration Division at JSC.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian and U.S. authorities are working out arrangements with
the unidentified owner of the meteorite. When the arrangements are
completed, they plan to slice into the meteorite and study its
contents in Houston. So far, NASA scientists have been allowed only
a cursory examination.
</P>
<P>
   However, they were able to quickly determine it is a
carbonaceous chondrite, a class of very primitive meteorite filled
with many kinds of carbon-based elements and other organic
material, some containing water bound into the molecular structure.
Carbonaceous chondrites comprise about 2 percent of the meteorites
recovered from the Earth. The most recent similar find occurred 30
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Critics will find it tough to dispute whatever scientists find
in the meteorite because of the care that was taken to prevent
terrestrial contamination. That was not the case with previous
carbonaceous chondrites found in the Antarctic and the African
desert.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might have been washed first in someone's home or passed
hand to hand before you ever saw it,'' said Zolensky. ``Here, for
the first time, we have an organically rich material which has been
kept very, very clean, about as clean as you can do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The fragments at Johnson Space Center appear charred and pitted
and porous. They are light to lift and smell of sulphur, said those
who have examined them.
</P>
<P>
   The meteorite fell to Earth in northern British Columbia in the
pre-dawn hours of Jan. 18, said Richard Herd, curator of Canada's
national meteorite collection.
</P>
<P>
   Traveling at more than(60,000 mph on a south-southeasterly
trajectory, the high-velocity meteorite exploded at least twice in
spectacular fireballs as it soared above the towns of Whitehorse
and Carcross. No injuries were reported.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was observed by thousands of people,'' Herd said. ``It left
a very large contrail in the sky, which was seen for the better
part of an hour.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on readings from seismic instruments that detected shock
waves from the explosions and infrared images that were detected by
U. S. military missile-warning satellites and other analyses,
experts estimate the meteorite was 50 feet across and weighed more
than 50 tons, or about the size of a bus.
</P>
<P>
   The searing heat of the high-speed entry into the Earth's
atmosphere formed a black crust on the exterior of the fragments
without heating the interior, Zolensky said.
</P>
<P>
   According to Herd, the spectacular fireball coincided with a
well-publicized test of American ballistic missile weaponry,
alarming many residents of northern British Columbia and the
southern Yukon who witnessed the contrail.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Canadian authorities issued public assurances that
there was no danger. Then they began asking the residents of the
sparsely populated region to look for signs of the fallen
meteorite.
</P>
<P>
   Zolensky mobilized a high-altitude NASA aircraft to fly along
the meteorite's path. It had special airborne collectors designed
to gather meteorite debris still in the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   By late January, Canadian authorities urged anyone who found
fragments from a meteorite not to handle the rocks. They included
instructions on how to collect the fragments with plastic bags and
to keep them in ice.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy paid off. On Feb. 3, authorities were alerted by a
Canadian citizen that he had found fragments on or near his land.
His request to remain anonymous was granted by the Canadian
government.
</P>
<P>
   By Feb. 7, a dozen fragments, the largest about the size of a
lump of charcoal and the smallest the size of a fingernail, began
arriving at Johnson Space Center, the same NASA facility that keeps
the moon rocks gathered by the Apollo astronauts in the late 1960s
and early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian authorities did not have the laboratories, equipment or
personnel with experience to analyze the rocks, Herd said.

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 19)  
 (af)  
 By SANA SIWOLOP   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Jacqueline Buford, 45, a real estate relocation manager,
decided late last year that her home in White Plains, N.Y., needed
some repairs, she was tempted to dip into her portfolio of taxable
mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   But selling fund shares at the time would have meant a large tax
bite this April. So Buford now plans to sell a portion of her funds
this spring, delaying the tax consequences for a year. She and her
husband, meanwhile, are also planning to make regular contributions
this year to their church's building fund, and they expect the
resulting charitable deduction to offset the capital gains tax she
expects to incur from the mutual fund sale.
</P>
<P>
   That's smart. But from a tax standpoint, an even better approach
would be to donate appreciated securities to the church or another
charity and let it sell them. The donor gets a deduction for the
full market value without having to pay capital gains tax; the
charity, of course, pays no tax, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hadn't thought of doing this, but it is something that I
would consider,'' said Buford, who is also president of the
Hudson-Housatonic chapter of the National Association of Investors
Corp., an educational group. ``Whenever we take distributions, we
try to take them earlier in the year, so that we can balance them
against charitable contributions, as well as against our entire
income picture. We're always, always contemplating tax issues.''
</P>
<P>
   As more Americans become active market traders, investors like
Buford should be the rule, rather than the exception, financial
planners say. But many planners report that the opposite seems to
be true: Too many investors ignore the tax consequences of their
market moves, thus generating unexpected tax bills. That is
especially the case for investors who are playing the markets in a
fast and furious way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see investors paying attention to taxes at all _
they're more interested in chasing profits,'' said Valerie
Lasher-Adelman, a certified financial planner and the founder of
Chestnut Financial in Bronx, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Lasher-Adelman said many of her clients had begun to ask about
buying individual stocks; two years ago, they were happy with
mutual funds. If they buy stocks and hold onto them, that could
have the happy consequence of lowering their taxes; mutual funds,
after all, pay out taxable capital gains even if you don't sell
shares. Still, she added, ``if investors these days are paying
attention to taxes, they're not doing it in a focused way.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosilyn Overton, a certified financial planner at Mid-Atlantic
Investments in Queens, N.Y., is more blunt. ``Investors are simply
not paying attention to tax consequences whatsoever,'' she said,
adding that many even seemed unaware of the sizable tax bite that
comes from selling appreciated stocks or other securities too soon.
</P>
<P>
   When a security is held less than a year, the capital gain is
taxable at the same rate as ordinary income _ 15 percent to 39.6
percent. But there is a break for longer-term gains. Taxpayers in
the 15 percent bracket pay just 10 percent on such gains, while
investors in the 28 percent to 39.6 percent brackets pay 20
percent.
</P>
<P>
   For an investor in the 28 percent bracket who has a capital gain
of $5,000, that would amount to a tax bill of $1,000, versus $1,400
on a short-term gain. Overton, however, said that many investors
persisted in ``looking at the tax difference as an 8 percent,
rather than a 40 percent difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, she said, frequent traders also seem unaware of
so-called wash sale rules. Usually, if a stock is sold at a loss,
that loss will offset gains on other sales. If net losses exceed
net gains, up to $3,000 can be used to offset earned income, with
any excess carried forward to future years.
</P>
<P>
   But under the wash sale rules, those tax breaks are not
available to traders who buy more of the same shares during the 30
days before or after the sale that yielded the loss.
</P>
<P>
   For certain investors, active trading may pose even greater tax
risks. Consider a resident of Rockland County in New York, a widow
in her late 60s who recently entered the stock market for the first
time, enticed by its outsized returns in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The widow, who spoke on condition of anonymity because she lives
alone, said she wanted to increase the small income she had been
receiving from her late husband's sizable investment portfolio,
which had been entirely in tax-free municipal bond funds. She sold
the bond fund shares in January and put the proceeds into taxable
mutual funds, hoping that she would be able to supplement her
income by making monthly withdrawals from the funds as they grew in
value.
</P>
<P>
   ``My accountant told me not to worry, but I'm still nervous,''
she said. ``For one, I want to hold on to my principal. But I'm
also concerned about how much I have to set aside for taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   Be prepared for a triple tax whammy, Lasher-Adelman advised. She
said the widow could expect to pay taxes on any dividends that were
paid by her funds, capital gains taxes on any stocks that the funds
sold at a profit and at least a 28 percent capital gains tax on any
portion of her funds that she held for less than a year before
selling.
</P>
<P>
   To play it safe, Lasher-Adelman suggested that the widow set
aside 40 percent of her capital gains for tax purposes. Longer
term, however, Lasher-Adelman is worried that if the market turns
bearish, the widow may have to dip into her principal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have preferred it if this investor had kept perhaps a
third to a half of her money in the municipal bond funds, to give
her a sense of security and to reduce the bite of what is now a
very taxable situation,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Overton's advice was even more conservative. She said she would
have liked to see the widow keep at least two-thirds of her
portfolio in bonds. ``I spend a good part of my day talking retired
people out of buying the stock du jour,'' she said. ``People are
becoming more aggressive than what is appropriate for their
circumstances, and that is certainly not helping their taxes.''

SHOPPING FOR TERM LIFE INSURANCE AS RATES RISE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y.)   (ART ADV: Graphic of best rates for term life insurance is being
sent to NYT graphic clients. Nonsubscribers can make individual
purchase by calling 888 603-1036 or 888 346-9867.)  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 19)  
 (af)  
 By JOSEPH B. TREASTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The life insurance industry is battening down its hatches _ and
consumers, it turns out, will pay the price.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, prices for term life, the most popular kind of
life insurance, had been declining for more than a decade. But new
regulations requiring insurers to set aside more money to cover
their potential payouts have caused rates for many policies to jump
20 percent to 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Before the new rules started taking effect on Jan. 1, a
45-year-old Pennsylvania man in excellent health, to pick a typical
example, could get $500,000 of coverage at a guaranteed annual
premium of $690 for 20 years from Transamerica Occidental Life
Insurance, a leading seller of term life, according to
AccuQuote.com, an online insurance agency. Now, that coverage is
selling for $850, an increase of about 23 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The regulations, which do not affect whole life policies, are
being adopted state by state. They bring prices elsewhere in the
country closer to levels in New York, where reserve requirements _
and hence prices _ have long been the highest in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Later this year, New York is expected to ease reserve
requirements, putting its insurers on an equal footing with the
rest of the country.
</P>
<P>
   What's a consumer to do? It is more important than ever to shop
around. Rates now range more widely, and there is greater variety
in the policies being offered, most intended to save a customer
money in the short run but with the risk that costs will rise
considerably in the long run.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts advise consumers to just bite the bullet by locking
in a policy for the typical 20 years at the higher rates. There are
options, but they involve extra risk.
</P>
<P>
   If you are thinking about life insurance, of course, you must
first decide whether you need it. Most experts say that comes down
to whether your death would leave your dependents in a financial
lurch. But you may not need the typical 20-year policy; a 10-year
policy might suffice, for example, to protect a child who is now
12.
</P>
<P>
   If you decide to get life insurance, remember that postponing
the purchase is risky. Insurance costs more the older you get, and
insurers love to tell tales of customers who died while mulling
things over.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, you might qualify for a policy from a company that has
not yet raised its prices. It is also possible, experts say, that
some companies will not set higher premiums but will instead absorb
the higher expense to gain market share.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a 20-year policy essentially identical to the one
for which Transamerica is now charging $850 can be purchased for
$690 a year from John Hancock Financial Services, which has not
raised its rates.
</P>
<P>
   Other options are riskier. You could buy a less expensive
10-year policy with a guaranteed annual flat rate, betting that
premiums will drop after that period and that you can buy a new
policy at a lower rate.
</P>
<P>
   After all, many experts say the price rise may be reversed in
two or three years as the insurance industry updates the tables on
which reserves are based. If you think prices may drop sooner
rather than later, you could buy coverage year to year, with costs
rising each year. That would cost less to start, but annual
premiums would exceed those for a 10-year policy after the third
year.
</P>
<P>
   But all of that is a gamble. Even if overall rates are lower
after 10 years, you will almost certainly have to pay higher
premiums when you are a decade older. There is also the risk that
your health will have deteriorated and that you will either have to
pay much more for a new policy or even be unable to get coverage at
any price.
</P>
<P>
   Another strategy to keep initial costs down is to get a policy
in which coverage is guaranteed for 20 years, but the premium is
fixed for only a portion of that time _ and, indeed, can later rise
considerably.
</P>
<P>
   Many companies are offering such plans. The Banner Life
Insurance Co., for instance, has a 20-year policy for a healthy,
45-year-old man that costs $655 a year. But that rate is guaranteed
for only five years; afterwards, the company advises, the annual
premium could shoot up to $3,720, and it could keep rising to a
peak of $16,200 in the final year of coverage.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Insurers have never charged those worst-case premiums, but
quoting them lets the company set aside smaller reserves and shift
to customers the risk of paying more if its claims and other
expenses increase.
</P>
<P>
   The Ohio National Life Insurance Co. is selling a 20-year policy
with the same initial premium _ $655 a year _ and with a similar
proviso about rates rising, but after just three years instead of
five.
</P>
<P>
   Many experts say such drastic increases would never occur.
Steven A. Smith, chief actuary of the First Colony Life Insurance
Co., another leader in term life sales, says they would be
suicidal. ``People would just stop buying your insurance,'' he
said, noting that policyholders can cancel term life coverage at
anytime without additional charges.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the risk of a price increase _ whether small or large _
falls on the customer's shoulders. Glenn S. Daily, an insurance
consultant in New York, said, ``People have no idea what risk they
are taking when they sign up for a nonguaranteed product.''
</P>
<P>
   Daily, who thinks that prices will head down in a few years,
suggests going the 10-year, fully guaranteed route. Or even
insuring year to year. If you choose a 10-year policy, he advises,
buy one that lets you convert coverage to whole life should your
health fail. Your premiums could be up to 10 times higher for the
whole life policy _ but at least you could not be denied coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet has made shopping for insurance much easier than in
the old days, when consumers had to deal with company agents one at
a time or find a broker who represented at least a few companies.
Some Internet insurers, including AccuQuote and Quotesmith.com,
offer comparisons of more than 100 companies with just a few key
strokes.
</P>
<P>
   Some sell policies online; others direct customers to an agent
for a consultation by phone. Once a choice is made, documents are
mailed out for signature. Often, a blood sample is taken and a
physical given to make sure the buyer really is in excellent health
and qualifies for the best rates.
</P>
<P>
   While price is important, there are other factors. Agents can
give guidance on considerations like insurers' financial strength
and whether a person's health permits him or her to qualify for the
best prices.
</P>
<P>
   Fooling yourself that your health is good enough to qualify you
for the most favorable rates can prove expensive. Often, companies
that offer the best prices for customers in excellent health charge
more than their competitors for coverage of those whose health is
only average.
</P>
<P>
   If you indicate that you are in excellent health, hoping to get
the preferred rate, and the insurer determines that your health is
only average, a new price will be proposed. And if you just sign up
for the coverage without shopping further, as many customers do,
you will very likely wind up paying more than you might otherwise,
perhaps now more than ever.
</P>
<P>
   The turmoil in term life insurance has not caused a stampede
toward whole life, which includes an investment component with a
low rate of return. Annual premiums on term life still tend to be
one-tenth of those for whole life, or even less.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buying term life is a little more complex now,'' said J.
Robert Hunter, the director of insurance for the Consumer
Federation of America. ``But if you shop around you can still get a
pretty good price.''

CREDIT SUISSE UNDER SCRUTINY FOR UKRAINIAN IMF LOANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN with JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Credit Suisse Group, the European banking giant, has long plied
the unpredictable waters of overseas financial markets with elan,
earning a reputation as a swashbuckler in corners of the globe as
far afield as the former Soviet Union and East Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The bank has made lush profits in many of those markets but has
also suffered bruising losses when speculative fervor overseas
turned against it in recent years. Still, Credit Suisse remains an
important player in emerging markets, particularly in the former
Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Credit Suisse is on the hot seat. Allegations of
improprieties in the way the Ukrainian central bank managed
International Monetary Fund loans are raising serious questions
about the bank's role in the matter.
</P>
<P>
   The bank's chairman, Rainer E. Gut, has been asked to testify
before the House Banking Committee next week at a hearing examining
money laundering and the possible misuse or theft of IMF money.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF disclosed this week that the Ukrainian central bank
engineered a series of financial transactions _ some through Cyprus
_ to inflate artificially its foreign currency reserves so that the
country could obtain hundreds of millions of dollars in IMF loans
that otherwise might have been denied. Some of the transactions
were conducted with the help of Credit Suisse's investment banking
arm, Credit Suisse First Boston, according to government
investigators in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF has retained the accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers
to audit the transactions for any evidence of wrongdoing and a
report is expected by the end of March. The Ukrainian government
and Credit Suisse have repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've examined all the transactions in question and we've
found nothing to cause us to believe that any of those transactions
were inappropriate or illegal,'' a Credit Suisse spokesman said in
an interview. Credit Suisse, citing bank secrecy laws in Cyprus,
declined to comment about whether it knew that transactions it
conducted for the Ukrainian central bank artificially increased
reserve levels.
</P>
<P>
   Credit Suisse was one of the first foreign companies to receive
a commercial banking license from the Ukrainian government and the
bank has conducted a wide variety of financial services for the
government. Just this week, Credit Suisse was one of several banks
that helped Ukraine repackage almost $3 billion in foreign debt to
avoid a default.
</P>
<P>
   Western financiers said that Alexander Bazarov, who runs Credit
Suisse First Boston's Kiev office, has played a key role in winning
business for Credit Suisse with the Ukrainian government. And the
authorities in the United States said that Bazarov was the banker
responsible for channeling the central bank funds in question
through Cyprus. Bazarov could not be reached for comment, and
Credit Suisse declined to comment on questions about him.
</P>
<P>
   Bazarov, a Ukrainian citizen who once worked in the Ukrainian
central bank, is said to be close to Viktor Yushchenko, Ukraine's
prime minister. Yushchenko was formerly the head of Ukraine's
central bank. Earlier this week, Yushchenko canceled a visit to the
United States after the Clinton administration told him he should
come only after ``cleaning up his government.'' Ukrainian officials
said the trip was canceled because of a mining disaster at home.
</P>
<P>
   Yushchenko's visit was discouraged soon before the Treasury
Department and the IMF disclosed the Ukrainian central bank's
financial maneuvers late Wednesday.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The IMF, a public agency financed by several Western
governments, has been widely criticized for lax lending and
oversight in the former Soviet Union. But it is the private and
very profitable Western commercial and investment banks that have
provided the financial plumbing underlying many of the transactions
under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Interest in the role played by Western financial institutions in
possibly aiding financial misdeeds in the former Soviet Union was
heightened by last year's disclosure that $7 billion in suspect
Russian money was funneled through the Bank of New York. The Bank
of New York has not been charged with wrongdoing and is cooperating
with the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The Financial Times was the first publication to report on
Credit Suisse's involvement with the Ukrainian central bank. One of
those cited by the paper as providing information about Credit
Suisse was Joel Bartow, a former FBI agent who once worked as a
member of the legal defense team for Pavlo Lazarenko, a former
Ukrainian prime minister. Bartow has been out of the country and
did not return phone calls seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Lazarenko is being detained by the federal authorities in
California while they consider extradition requests from
Switzerland and Ukraine on charges of embezzling state funds and
money laundering. As prime minister, Lazarenko may have pocketed
millions of dollars from state programs, according to Ukrainian,
Swiss and United States authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Lazarenko has a personal interest in any stories that impugn the
integrity of Ukraine's government.
</P>
<P>
   His wealth and power were growing so briskly during 1996 and
1997, his two years as prime minister, that the situation led to a
rift with Ukraine's president, Leonid Kuchma, who dismissed
Lazarenko from his influential post. Lazarenko subsequently formed
an opposition party and planned to run for the presidency until he
fled Ukraine in late 1998, just days before prosecutors there
charged him with embezzling millions of dollars in government
funds. Lazarenko has not been charged with any crime in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Handwerker, a New York lawyer representing Lazarenko,
said that charges against his client were politically motivated and
noted that some of Lazarenko's reputed co-conspirators are now
members of Kuchma's administration.
</P>
<P>
   Handwerker would not comment on any of the issues involving the
Ukrainian central bank and the IMF, other than to point out that
Bartow is no longer a member of Lazarenko's legal team.
</P>
<P>
   Problems with the management of central bank funds in Ukraine
bear striking similarities to questions that were raised last year
about the management of Russian central bank reserves.
IMF-sponsored audits of its lending to the Russian central bank,
also conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers, found no evidence of any
misappropriation, although the IMF said that the central bank had
misled it about the level of its foreign currency reserves.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, questions still linger about how Russian central
bank funds were managed through an offshore entity known as Fimaco.
Hefty interest payments earned on billions of dollars invested by
Fimaco in high-yielding Russian debt still have not been entirely
accounted for _ an issue also under scrutiny in the Ukrainian
central bank matter.

WALL STREET IS URGED TO DISCLOSE ALL UNFILLED ORDERS FOR SHARES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill.) (rk) 
 By FLOYD NORRIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission called on
Wall Street Thursday to voluntarily put together a system that
would disclose all stock orders that have not yet been filled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now is the time for all market participants to move towards
open books on all markets,'' said Arthur Levitt, the SEC chairman,
in remarks prepared for a speech at Northwestern University. ``Now
is the time for a voluntary private sector initiative in this
important area _ one that does not require major systems
engineering.''
</P>
<P>
   All markets are now required to disclose any limit orders _
orders to buy or sell a stock at a particular price _ if that order
represents the best available price in the market. Levitt proposed
going further than that, but he also said that he was ``deeply
troubled'' by evidence that even the disclosures required now are
often not being made.
</P>
<P>
   ``In far too many cases,'' he said, ``limit orders are being
mishandled by market intermediaries'' and not being exposed to the
market as required. He said that an SEC examination of one regional
stock exchange, which he did not identify, showed ``at least one
out of six limit orders was not properly displayed.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the SEC staff would prepare a report on the extent of
that problem in the next 45 days. But he added that just showing
the best orders, as is now required, was not enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ability of all investors to see the depth of supply and
demand in any stock would be a giant step toward a true national
market system,'' he said. ``And it is a step that our markets
should take now, before the uncertainty of decimalization is upon
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Stock prices are now usually quoted in increments of
one-sixteenth of a dollar, or 6.25 cents. But when markets switch
to decimals, or cents, the increments could decline to a penny.
``In many respects, price transparency today is like seeing the tip
of an iceberg, and having no idea how much rests below,'' he said.
``Without more transparency, ascertaining supply and demand below
the top of the book could become more difficult in a world of
pennies.''
</P>
<P>
   Levitt said he would convene a meeting with many people from the
industry to try to encourage such disclosures, which would then be
disseminated by the companies, like Reuters and Bloomberg, that now
disseminate price quotes.

ADVERTISING COLUMN: TWO PRODUCTS, TWO AGENCIES, IDENTICAL ADS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two beverage marketers are running television
commercials that no doubt have many viewers wondering whether they
are seeing double.
</P>
<P>
   The commercials, for Michelob Light beer and Colombian coffee,
have similar premises and resemble each other closely. The spots
also began running nationally about the same time, with Michelob
Light appearing first, in December.
</P>
<P>
   The dueling commercials are indicative of a problem that has
been vexing Madison Avenue for many years, centered on the
origination of ideas and how to properly credit the creators. That
is made difficult by the fact that advertising is a business that
borrows liberally from the popular culture, producing work meant to
capitalize on the success of the intellectual property of others
from movies to TV series to songs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's seldom plagiarism,'' said Bob Garfield, ad critic for the
trade publication Advertising Age, ``especially if they are
appearing simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some cases, it really does seem as if two people are
plucking the same radio signals from the zeitgeist,'' he added.
``Or it's the same fairly obvious idea occurring to two people at
the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   Garfield gave several examples of the phenomenon: a brewer and a
battery maker running commercials that parody other commercials; an
automaker and an auto-parts maker running spots that compare cars
rebuilt using parts not factory authorized to Frankenstein's
monster; and ``three commercials all on at the same time with
Morocco as their settings, all essentially ending with the same
joke.''
</P>
<P>
   There are numerous other examples. Two brands of athletic shoes
once proclaimed, ``The only competition is yourself.'' And ads for
an imported beer presented the imaginary complaints of a
make-believe protest group about a year after a campaign for a
Scotch whiskey used the same tongue-in-cheek tactic.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, duels between dual ideas are not confined to
advertising. In recent years, Hollywood studios have released pairs
of movies about volcanoes, Wyatt Earp, asteroids and missions to
Mars.
</P>
<P>
   In this instance, both the Michelob Light and Colombian coffee
commercials are set in supermarkets. They share the same plot:
store employees manhandle groceries until the product being
advertised comes down the conveyor belt.
</P>
<P>
   In the Michelob Light spot, by the Leap Partnership in Chicago,
a unit of Leapnet, a bored bag boy carelessly tosses groceries into
a bag. He jams in a plant upside down and even breaks a loaf of
bread in half.
</P>
<P>
   But when the cashier rings up a six-pack of Michelob Light, the
bag boy radically alters his routine. He enrobes the package in
bubble wrap, tapes it closed and writes ``Fragile'' on the bag. He
even says ``Have a nice day'' as the shoppers leave.
</P>
<P>
   The other commercial, for the National Federation of Coffee
Growers of Colombia, was created by DDB Worldwide Marketing in New
York, part of the DDB Worldwide Communications Group unit of the
Omnicom Group. This time, the cashier and the bag boy are both
miscreants; the cashier haphazardly tosses the groceries to the bag
boy, who then mistreats them.
</P>
<P>
   Again, the impulse to reform is generated by the product being
pitched. When the cashier and bag boy see a can of Colombian
coffee, they handle it lovingly. As he encases it in bubble wrap,
an announcer proclaims, ``The reaction when you buy 100 percent
Colombian coffee can be quite surprising.'' Only when he is done do
the employees resume their mayhem.
</P>
<P>
   Anheuser-Busch, which makes Michelob Light, had a terse response
to a question about the similarity of the two spots. Here is the
text of the brewer's statement: ``We are aware of the Colombian
coffee federation commercial in question. We are pleased with the
response our ad has received.''

   Peter le Comte, president of DDB Worldwide Marketing, was more
expansive in his reply.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very much aware'' of the Michelob Light spot, he said,
adding: ``We've been bombarded with e-mails from people asking us
what happened. That's good for us, because it means our commercial
provokes a reaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have written it off as an incident of coincidence. They
will run their commercial and we will run ours.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, he added, chuckling, ``I don't think we share the same
consumers, unless they drink too much beer and need to drink coffee
before they drive.''

ESPN SERIES GOES DEEP INTO THE PAST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It's the middle of February in Las Vegas, so the
brisk wind whipping out and the smell of rain in the air might mean
snow isn't far away. Even so, more than 8,500 folks who paid $15 a
ticket are packed into Triple-A ballpark Cashman Field just to see
a bunch of guys smack the bejesus out of batting-practice baseballs
in a made-for-TV event.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark McGwire told me he thought it was great so many fans came
out,'' said ESPN baseball executive producer Tim Scanlan, ``but he
said, `If you really wanted to do it like the old show, you'd have
an empty stadium.'''
</P>
<P>
   Now that would just be sacrilegious.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, ESPN's production of the ``Big League Challenge''
(starting Monday at 2:30 p.m. on ESPN2) can't duplicate the simple
hokeyness of ``Home Run Derby'' from 1959. To watch that series
now, it's like an eerie episode of ``The Twilight Zone'' but a
priceless piece of baseball history as well.
</P>
<P>
   Filmed in black and white at a barren Wrigley Field in Los
Angeles that no longer exists, the host might as well have been Rod
Serling instead of the star-struck Mark Scott, who sat at a little
table and, for whatever reason, kept a thick baseball record book
by his microphone.
</P>
<P>
   But the way he brought out these young versions of Mickey
Mantle, Willie Mays and Hank Aaron, new L.A. Dodgers Duke Snider
and Gil Hodges at the end of their careers, plus all the other
sluggers of the day such as Frankie Robinson, Harmon Killebrew and
Rocky Colavito competing in a head-to-head home run-hitting
contest. That can't be duplicated.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN's intent for this updated version of powerball is to
maintain the spirit of that show but inject modern technology to
make the competition seem more alive - which includes adding the
``studio audience'' of fans whose oohs and aahs are as significant
as the computerized graphics that measure the distance of these
rocket shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to show that in 2000, this is how far that series has
come,'' said Scanlan, who oversees ESPN's baseball coverage. ``That
was our mandate. It was a competition and people wanted to see Mays
vs. Aaron. But they didn't have things like aerial coverage. We
brought all of the ESPN toys to this production and you'll see all
of them.''
</P>
<P>
   That means instead of a couple of stagnant cameras, there will
be 17, including one in front of the pitching mound and in the
opposite batters' box. There's also ESPN standards such as MaskCam,
Bat Track and wireless mikes for each participant.
</P>
<P>
   Over Valentine's Day weekend last month, it was McGwire, Barry
Bonds, Shawn Green, Mike Piazza, Jose Canseco, Rafael Palmeiro,
Nomar Garciaparra, Manny Ramirez, Chipper Jones, Alex Rodriguez,
Jason Giambi and Andruw Jones, who volunteered to crank it up for a
tournament, which raised money for the MLBPA's Players Trust for
Children charitable foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Sammy Sosa also came but couldn't compete because of an illness
that put him in the hospital on the morning of the event. Ken
Griffey Jr. was scheduled, too, but his trade from Seattle to
Cincinnati went down two days before the taping and he backed out.
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1959, the winner of each nine-inning match was given a
$2,000 prize and advanced to the next show. The loser got $1,000,
and if anyone hit three homers in a row, there was a $500 bonus.
Aaron ended up making the most appearances, six, on the 26-episode
series and had $13,500 to show for it. The Milwaukee Braves star
used it to buy his dad a grocery store back home in Mobile, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   In this go-around, there's no individual financial reward for
winning, but it is a tournament. All preliminary matches were five
innings so that they didn't have to be edited down too much. The
nine-inning finale on March 31 is an hour show.
</P>
<P>
   The players were seeded based on last season's home-run
production. The top four - McGwire, Sosa (replaced by Andruw
Jones), Chipper Jones and Palmeiro - had first-round byes.
</P>
<P>
   The original series ended after one year because Scott, who was
also the executive producer, died of a heart attack at age 45. The
shows sat in an MGM/UA vault in Culver City until someone offered
them to ESPN, and they were aired at midnight in November of 1988
to fill in programming holes. The public reaction, in part, helped
push the series to be replayed and sparked the creation of the
Classic Sports Network, which was eventually bought by ESPN's
parent company, Cap Cities, in 1996 and renamed ESPN Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the now popular All-Star game exhibitions, there have
been several attempts since the late '80s to bring back a home run
derby TV show. ABC once put McGwire and Canseco, then teammates in
Oakland, in an empty Dodger Stadium to tape a competition. McGwire
and Bonds also did one for a regional cable TV show in Arizona
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But because of the red tape of possible appearance fees and
player availability, this is the first time a series this large has
been regenerated. It's due mostly to the efforts of the MLBPA and
its relationship with ESPN over the last few years of covering the
``Players Choice Awards'' show in November.
</P>
<P>
   For ``Big League Challenge'' host Gary Thorne, the challenge was
to recreate the relaxed atmosphere of the original series without
looking so stiff on camera.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to see the players relate to each other, like a
pickup basketball game with that `aw shucks' feeling,'' said
Thorne. ``The guys really enjoyed themselves. It amazed me that it
came through. They were having a great time just seeing how far
they could hit one after watching the other guy do it. I don't
think you saw that in the original show.''
</P>
<P>
   So since it's all been taped and people actually saw it, how
does the 2000 version of ``Home Run Derby'' turn out? For those who
don't know, we won't tell too much.
</P>
<P>
   Canseco provides most of the highlights, including a reunion
against McGwire that goes extra innings (airing March 24) and
hitting a memorable shot in the final that goes well beyond the
474-foot scoreboard, over a building and bounces onto a highway 650
feet away, where it hits a van that's moving and causes the driver
to stop.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the first sighting of Green, the new Dodger who
brought along childhood friend Ben Strack to be his personal
pitcher. Green smacks one over a video screen and off an 185-foot
light tower in right field.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you get in a groove, it's OK,'' Green said on how difficult
it is to produce home runs on demand for a TV show. ``And there's
always pressure when there's people watching.''
</P>
<P>
   That kind of pressure wasn't there for Ernie Banks, who had just
come off back-to-back MVP seasons with the Chicago Cubs, when he
competed in the original show.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no one in the stands and I liked that. It was so
quiet,'' said Banks, who ESPN brought back to be an analyst for
Monday's first show (with subsequent shows using Piazza as the
analyst).
</P>
<P>
   ``You may not believe it, but it's true - I didn't even realize
they were filming the show. You didn't notice cameras like you do
today. But we did get the feeling at that time that somehow, TV was
going to play a part of baseball's future.''
</P>

KINGS LOSE PALFFY TO INJURY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As the Kings' best player, Ziggy Palffy is a
target. Now, he is a casualty.
</P>
<P>
   Palffy, whose scoring and playmaking have helped put the Kings
on the verge of qualifying for the Stanley Cup playoffs, is
expected to miss at least the final three weeks of the regular
season with a sprained right shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Palffy, tied with teammate Luc Robitaille for 14th in the NHL in
scoring, was injured early in the third period of Wednesday's 2-2
tie with the Mighty Ducks on a vicious hit by defenseman Vitaly
Vishnevski.
</P>
<P>
   Kings coach Andy Murray said the hit was clean, but that didn't
make it any easier watching Palffy helped from the ice.
</P>
<P>
   And though the Kings (34-27-9) are fifth in the Western
Conference race with 80 points, Palffy's absence during the final
12 games could impact playoff pairings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime you lose a player of that caliber, you lose a lot,''
Murray said on the eve of tonight's game against St. Louis, the
league's top team this season. ``But we've been through it before
this season and we have survived. I didn't even bring it up in the
dressing room today. We lost Luc and (Jozef Stumpel) for long
periods earlier in the year. You just have to keep moving
forward.''
</P>
<P>
   When Robitaille (six weeks), Stumpel (10 weeks) and goaltender
Stephane Fiset (six weeks) were sidelined with injuries in November
and December, the team buckled. The Kings lost six straight at one
point and had just two victories in 13 games.
</P>
<P>
   Palffy also missed six games this season with a strained lower
back.
</P>
<P>
   Before this season, he had missed just three games during his
six-year career. But through a rigorous off-ice rehabilitation
program, Palffy recovered.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Palffy was examined by team physician Ronald Kvitne
and underwent an MRI exam. In Palffy's absence, the Kings will use
rookie Jason Blake at right wing on the first unit.
</P>
<P>
   Blake, who has played every line this season, was a healthy
scratch for the Kings game in Anaheim. He has four goals and 16
assists in 54 games.
</P>
<P>
   Murray elected not to break up his second line, which added
Nelson Emerson at Tuesday's trade deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Second-unit center Bryan Smolinski scored both goals in
Wednesday's tie with Anaheim. Glen Murray had two assists and
Emerson had one.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the group that carried us when other players were
injured,'' said Andy Murray. ``They've struggled a bit lately, but
they picked it up against the Ducks and we'll need that.''
</P>
<P>
   Palffy, acquired with Smolinski last summer from the New York
Islanders, is no longer just the pure scorer that produced three
consecutive 40-goal seasons.
</P>
<P>
   In 64 games, Palffy has 27 goals and 39 assists for 66 points.
Those are hardly career numbers. He had 48 goals three seasons ago.
But he also never has been to the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   However, protecting him has been difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this season, the Kings tried to retaliate when opposing
teams took a run at Palffy and often wound up in the penalty box.
</P>
<P>
   Murray has worked to break that habit.
</P>
<P>
   A turning point was Feb. 18 in Detroit when Palffy was flattened
by Red Wings strong man Darren McCarty. They did not retaliate and
won the game 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to see your top scorer down on the ice,'' said
enforcer Ian Laperriere.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the game is still going on and you have to be careful. You
want to take the other guy on, but you don't want to wind up in the
penalty box.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kings added grit at Tuesday's trade deadline by acquiring
Kelly Buchberger, whose fights with former Kings tough guy Marty
McSorley were legendary.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the third period on Wednesday, Buchberger also was hit
by Vishnevski.
</P>
<P>
   Many thought that hit was illegal, but Buchberger kept his
distance.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Kings must keep the rest of the West at a distance
without Palffy. They are eight points ahead of Edmonton for the
eighth and final playoff spot and 10 ahead of No. 9 Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two ways to go with this,'' Murray said. ``You can
worry and complain and cry about it, but where is that going to get
you? Or you can buckle down. and do the job. We were in a battle
before we lost Ziggy and we're still in a battle.''
</P>
<P>
   KINGS vs. ST. LOUIS
</P>
<P>
   Time: 5:30 p.m., Staples Center
</P>
<P>
   TV/Radio: ESPN, KRLA-AM (1110)
</P>
<P>
   Matchup: The Blues have been a big help to the Kings, beating
Phoenix twice this week and helping the Kings move into second in
the Pacific Division. St. Louis had seen their seven-point lead in
the West trimmed to two before their 5-3 victory over the Coyotes.
The Kings had other injuries to report other than Ziggy Palffy, who
could miss a month with sprained right shoulder. Backup goaltender
Marcel Cousineau was teased in Thursday's practice for complaining
of a stomachache. An hour later he was being prepped for surgery to
remove his appendix. Doesn't sound like much, but with top
goaltender Stephane Fiset still out with a groin, the Kings have
had to call up goaltender Mike O'Neill from minor-league Lowell,
Mass. Aki Berg (concussion) is still out.

INVESTIGATION CLEARS FIRST LADY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A four-year investigation into possible misuse of
FBI files has found no criminal wrongdoing by first lady Hillary
Rodham Clinton or senior White House officials, independent counsel
Robert Ray reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The special prosecutor also said no credible evidence indicates
that former White House counsel Bernard Nussbaum lied to Congress
about the hiring of a staff member who sought the confidential
background files on Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Ray, who was named in October to replace former independent
counsel Kenneth Starr, issued a statement saying the two
investigations were ending and that ``no prosecutions were
warranted.''
</P>
<P>
   Two reports outlining Ray's conclusions were submitted under
seal to a panel of three federal appellate judges who named Starr,
then Ray, to oversee what has evolved into a $50 million
investigation of President Clinton and his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Yet to come are final reports on inquiries into the firings of
the White House travel staff, the Monica Lewinsky scandal and
Whitewater, an Arkansas land deal that triggered the investigation
in mid-1994.
</P>
<P>
   The reports are being kept confidential by the three-judge
panel, at least until people named in the documents have a chance
to respond. Even then, the court can decide not to release the
reports to the public.
</P>
<P>
   The sprawling investigation led to Clinton's impeachment by the
House of Representatives on charges stemming from his effort to
conceal his sexual affair with Lewinsky, a former White House
intern. Clinton was acquitted by the Senate in February 1999.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about Ray's statement, which was issued to the news
media, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart bristled. ``Well, that's
really good, since that report hasn't been provided to the White
House, and it involves the White House,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   The summary of Ray's findings echoed testimony by Starr in
November 1998, when he acknowledged to the House Judiciary
Committee that his investigation had yielded no criminal wrongdoing
by the president or first lady in either the FBI files case or the
travel office firings.
</P>
<P>
   Saying ``there shouldn't be much news in this,'' Lockhart
dismissed Ray's reports and questioned why his findings had not
been issued sooner. ``I don't know why we've continued on this
subject for another couple years and why the report's coming out
now,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI files inquiry grew out of what Clinton at the time
called ``an honest bureaucratic mess-up'' in which Anthony Marceca,
an Army detailee at the White House, in 1993 and 1994 gathered
hundreds of FBI files on Republicans, mostly workers in the Reagan
and Bush administrations.
</P>
<P>
   Marceca's boss, former White House security office chief Craig
Livingstone, resigned after a congressional committee investigation
in 1996 turned up the possible misuse of the files. Livingstone
maintained he didn't know that Marceca had collected the files.
</P>
<P>
   White House aides blamed the Secret Service for providing
Livingstone and Marceca with outdated lists of White House
passholders. Marceca used the lists to order the background files
from the FBI, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   An FBI agent reported that Nussbaum said in a 1993 interview
that Hillary Clinton had ``highly'' recommended Livingstone to run
the security office. When Nussbaum testified before the House
Government Reform Committee in 1996, he denied knowing who hired
Livingstone and specifically denied discussing the former nightclub
bouncer with the first lady.
</P>
<P>
   Ray on Thursday said his office ``determined there was no
substantial and credible evidence that Mr. Nussbaum lied'' about
his discussions with Hillary Clinton regarding Livingstone.
</P>
<P>
   The independent counsel also said ``there was no substantial and
credible evidence that any senior White House official, or first
lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, was involved in seeking confidential
Federal Bureau of Investigation background reports'' on Republicans
hired during the Reagan and Bush administrations.
</P>
<P>
   Ray's announcement drew criticism from at least one Republican
appointee, a former Bush speechwriter who is a figure in a lawsuit
accusing the Clinton administration of violating a federal privacy
law.
</P>
<P>
   Closing out the probe without any prosecutions is ``a
travesty,'' said Joseph Duggan, adding that he would ask the
Justice Department to investigate possible violations of the
Privacy Act of 1974.
</P>
<P>
   ``These raw investigative files invariably contain material that
is not necessarily true, but almost certainly is negative and
embarrassing,'' said Duggan, who is participating in a lawsuit
filed against Clinton by Judicial Watch. ``The FBI improperly gave
our files to unauthorized and politically hostile individuals.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray explained that his investigation did not include possible
Privacy Act abuses, which would amount to misdemeanors and would
fall outside the independent counsel's jurisdiction.

UTAH STATE UNHAPPY WITH SEED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL, WENDELL BARNHOUSE AND MIKE JONES 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The NCAA selection committee placed Utah State in the South
Region and awarded the Aggies a No. 12 seed, ``which has stirred up
a lot of conversation,'' coach Stu Morrill said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is not something we can focus on, but it is something our
conference needs to address,'' Morrill said.
</P>
<P>
   The Aggies enter the NCAA Tournament with the nation's longest
winning streak at 19 and were ranked 27th nationally in RPI.
Connecticut coach Jim Calhoun expected the Aggies to be seeded
ninth or 10th, but ``they're not, and we're playing them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach Calhoun was nice enough to say that he was not happy to
have to play us,'' Morrill said. ``I can turn that around and say,
`How do you think I feel?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the Big West Conference's regular-season and tournament
champions can find solace in the fact that at least one No. 12 seed
has won its first-round game during the past 11 NCAA Tournaments.
STRANGE YEAR FOR 'HEELS
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina (18-13) finished the season unranked in The
Associated Press Poll.
</P>
<P>
   It marked the eighth consecutive week that the Tar Heels were
not ranked after spending 172 consecutive weeks in the AP poll, the
second-longest streak in NCAA history. ``I think we were a little
overrated in preseason, but it's the head coach's job to get the
most out of the team,'' Tar Heels coach Bill Guthridge said, ``and
we have not been clicking on all cylinders this season.'' DO YOU
KNOW US?
</P>
<P>
   The University of Louisiana at Lafayette appears to be suffering
from an identity crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Formerly known as the University of Southwestern Louisiana, it
became the University of Louisiana at Lafayette on Sept. 10. Their
postseason media guide makes that rather clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the new name change, please refer to us as
Louisiana-Lafayette, UL Lafayette, Louisiana's Ragin' Cajuns,
Ragin' Cajuns or Cajuns,'' the media guide requests. ``Please do
not use `ULL' or abbreviate Lafayette in any references.''
</P>
<P>
   Duly noted. BENCH STRENGTH
</P>
<P>
   The Ragin' Cajuns' Orlando Butler leads Louisiana-Lafayette in
scoring at 13.1 points per game, but the junior guard has not
started a game this season for coach Jessie Evans.

<P>
   ``My role on this team is to feed off the starting five,''
Butler said. ``(Not) starting doesn't bother me,'' Butler said.
``Starting is just another thing I don't have to worry about.''
DELAYED START
</P>
<P>
   The Kentucky-St. Bonaventure double-overtime game was the first
game of the afternoon session at the Midwest Region site in
Cleveland. That meant the second game between Syracuse and Stamford
started nearly 45 minutes later than expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were very anxious, we wanted to get out there and play,''
Syracuse senior guard Jason Hart said of the wait in the locker
room. ``The more I sat there, the more butterflies I accumulated in
my stomach.''
</P>
<P>
   Syracuse coach Jim Boeheim said he thinks his team lost a little
bit of its edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I actually left the locker room and watched some of the
(Kentucky-St. Bonaventure) game,'' he said. ``The toughest thing in
coaching is having to wait for the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Samford fell behind 24-13 in the game's first 10 minutes, but
Bulldogs coach Jimmy Tillette did not blame the game's delayed
start for his team's 79-65 loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I did not have these guys prepared well enough and
the late start had nothing to do with the result,'' he said. QUE
SERA
</P>
<P>
   Indiana State players were philosophical about their
opening-round loss to Texas in the program's first tournament
experience in 21 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we had a great season,'' forward Matt Renn said.
``Getting 20 wins and making it to the NCAA Tournament was our goal
and we accomplished that. Hopefully, this will become a standard at
Indiana State.'' nn

YANKEES DISCUSS EDMONDS DEAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX, Ariz. -- Yankees owner George Steinbrenner called a
``summit'' meeting Thursday night in Tampa involving his top front
office executives, the scouting staff, manager Joe Torre and his
coaches to discuss the possibility of trading for Angels center
fielder Jim Edmonds.
</P>
<P>
   The restaurant in Tampa -- Malio's -- is where Steinbrenner has
conducted several top-level meetings, including one last year that
led to the trade for Roger Clemens. According to reports,
Steinbrenner has grown impatient with the Yankees poor play this
spring (5-12) and particularly their lack of production in left
field.
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner is known to love action and this is the first year
since the Yankees World Series run began in 1996 that the club has
not made a major acquisition going into the season.
</P>
<P>
   Top Yankees scout Gene Michael is spearheading the effort to
acquire Edmonds. Michael believes in having two left-handed slugger
outfielders signed long-term playing in Yankee Stadium, and with
37-year-old Paul O'Neill in the final year of his contract, the
Yankees need that second lefty to complement Bernie Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all in the Yankees organization believe Edmonds will make
them a better team. Where there is debate has to do with who the
Yankees are willing to give up in return. And that's what
Thursday's meeting was about.
</P>
<P>
   Some in the organization -- including Torre -- do not want to
part with pitcher Ramiro Mendoza and would be more willing to trade
shortstop/second baseman Alfonso Soriano. Others are not as high on
Mendoza and would include him in a trade, but want to use Soriano
to acquire pitching help. No one seems to have reservations about
including outfielder Ricky Ledee in a deal.
</P>
<P>
   Another issue is Edmonds' contract status. Edmonds is a free
agent at the end of the season and the Yankees are reluctant to
trade for him unless they are given a ``window'' -- typically 72
hours -- to sign Edmonds to a contract extension.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams would first have to agree on the players involved,
but if and when that happens, the Angels are not philosophically
opposed to granting that window to another team.
</P>
<P>
   ``You examine the circumstances and make a decision, just like
you do in any business situation,'' Angels general manager Bill
Stoneman said when asked if he would grant a signing window.
``There's no one answer for all circumstances. That would be
silly.''
</P>
<P>
   Edmonds would agree to negotiating with the Yankees under such
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   There are other teams still interested in Edmonds, including the
A's, Mariners and Rockies. Stoneman and A's general manager Billy
Beane sat in the seats behind homeplate of Thursday's game between
the Angels and A's and chatted for an inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels' biggest need is starting pitching, and with Ramon
Ortiz's status uncertain (slight tear in labrum of right shoulder)
there is even more reason to make a deal for pitching help.
</P>
<P>
   Stoneman, though, has not buckled under the pressure and given
Edmonds or any of his other outfielders away for less than their
value. A healthy Edmonds will have a big season this year, whatever
uniform he's wearing, and Stoneman knows it.
</P>
<P>
   The question now seems to be, are the Yankees willing to pay the
price.
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz will play catch today but will not throw off the mound
again until Monday. Angels manager Mike Scioscia said Ortiz will
probably throw two bullpens before pitching in a game again.
``We're very content to take a step backwards with him so it will
push us forward in the long run,'' Sciosica said.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Schoeneweis took a big step towards winning a spot in the
starting rotation with his performance Thursday against the A's.
Schoeneweis went five innings -- most by an Angels pitcher this
spring -- and allowed two runs and five hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying I can't do better, but I'm doing what I expect
to at this time of the year,'' said Schoeneweis, who has a 2.25
spring ERA. ``It's only going to get better. Every spring training
I've gotten better and I will continue that going into the regular
season.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Scotty's coming on,'' Scioscia said. ``He located his pitches
and had pretty good movement. And that's a good lineup. He has the
arm and he has the stuff. Now, he has the opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Left-handed veteran Greg Cadaret, vying for a spot in the
bullpen, was released after Thursday's game. Cadaret had been
battling Juan Alvarez and Mike Holtz for the left-handed reliever
spot, but Cadaret, 38, sealed his own fate in Thursday's game
against the A's. Facing four left-handed hitters, Cadaret gave up
three consecutive singles, then a hard-hit sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   The two runs off Cadaret in the eighth inning cost the Angels
the game, 4-3. But the Angels did get a home run from Mo Vaughn and
two from Scott Spiezio, a former Athletic who is the favorite to
win the starting job at second base.

NASAL STRIPS, AND RACING BRASS, HARD TO FIGURE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TIM PRICE 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I've never taken exception to the use of nasal strips on
racehorses. As long as horse racing commissions are allowing the
use of Lasix _ which produces a measurable chemical change in a
horse _ I can't see much reason to bellyache when anyone wants to
take a strip of tape and adorn a horse's snout with it.
</P>
<P>
   There are people who aren't hip on nasal strips because they fly
in the face of tradition. But that's not the reason nasal strips
have become another sad episode in horse racing.
</P>
<P>
   Nasal strips, like the ones athletes or snorers wear across
their noses, are designed to hold a horse's upper breathing passage
open and make it easier _ or less noisy _ to breath.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison to the medication Lasix, a nasal strip is a
physical change. So are blinkers, front wraps, tongue ties, mud
caulks, D bits and body clipping.
</P>
<P>
   We know that the addition or removal of blinkers can change the
way a horse races. We know that front wraps can indicate soreness.
So we take notice when they are reported in the ``Daily Racing
Form'' or track program.
</P>
<P>
   The jury's still out on how nasal strips affect, or don't
affect, the way a horse races. There has been no independent report
from any institution of higher learning. So the horse racing
industry struggles over the question of whether to report the use
of nasal strips or whether to ignore them like tongue ties and
bits.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know whether nasal strips make much difference or not.
Personally, I don't pay much attention to them when I handicap a
race.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Cat Thief won the Breeders' Cup Classic was more
because of a speed-favoring track than the fact he wore a nasal
strip. He has won with and without them.
</P>
<P>
   Nasal strips have not proven that a horse like Cat Thief can run
better with one than he can without. The only thing nasal strips
have proven _ like this hasn't been proven before _ is that horse
racing botches anything new.
</P>
<P>
   First, state racing commissions can't agree if nasal strips
should be allowed or not. Then a place like Texas has a commission
that decides to allow them, but doesn't require that their use be
reported.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Equibase and the ``Daily Racing Form'' are reporting
nasal-strip use. They're both partners in gathering and reporting
past performance information, yet Equibase denotes nasal-strip use
with an ``s'' in the equipment column of a past performance when it
sends the information for publication in track programs. In the
editions of its publication, the ``Daily Racing Form'' changes it
to ``n.''
</P>
<P>
   From the start, this has been a goofy, sad episode _ the
quintessence of horse racing administration.
</P>
<P>
   Because horse racing can't get it right, maybe nasal strips
should be banned.
</P>
<P>
   A TROUBLED RATE
</P>
<P>
   When Exchange Rate hung and finished fourth in last weekend's
Louisiana Derby, jockey Corey Nakatani said the colt couldn't
handle the track. He didn't seem to have trouble with it when he
won the Risen Star Stakes at Fair Grounds last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``They tightened down the track this time,'' Nakatani said,
``and he was bobbling on it every time he tried to pick it up and
run.''
</P>
<P>
   Exchange Rate, whose next race is expected in the Wood Memorial
on April 15 in New York, was shipped to Churchill Downs this week
and showed up with a lung infection.
</P>
<P>
   RUNNING THE MERCEDES
</P>
<P>
   Elite Mercedes flipped the palate in his upper breathing passage
while finishing eighth in the Florida Derby last weekend,
part-owner Bill Casner of Southlake said. The colt is expected to
race in the $600,000 Spiral Stakes (formerly the Jim Beam Stakes)
on March 25 at Turfway Park.
</P>
<P>
   If that doesn't go well, Casner indicated Elite Mercedes could
race in the Lone Star Derby on April 22. But that might make the
Kentucky Derby unlikely because the races are two weeks apart.
</P>
<P>
   The $1 million bonus Lone Star is offering is available to the
horse that wins the Lone Star Derby and any Triple Crown race. But
if Elite Mercedes skips the Kentucky Derby and races in the
Preakness, he'll try to break a long-standing trend. A horse hasn't
won the Preakness without running in the Derby since Deputed
Testimony beat a field that included Sunny's Halo in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   WRONA'S DEAL
</P>
<P>
   Michael Wrona, who has been the toast of sports talk-radio shows
since he was named track announcer at Lone Star Park at Grand
Prairie last week, has been signed to a three-year contract. The
Australian will call the races for both the thoroughbred and
quarter-horse seasons.
</P>
<P>
   A three-year stint would be his longest with one track since
Wrona arrived in North America in 1990. He has worked at two tracks
that have experienced financial problems (Retama Park in 1995 and
Arlington International in 1997) and another that has been
controlled by volatile management (Hollywood Park and Bay Meadows).
</P>
<P>
   When he departed from his second gig at Hollywood to come to
Lone Star, new management at that track had not secured Wrona to a
contract.
</P>
<P>
   SPOTLIGHT ON ...
HEAVENS NEED TO OPEN FOR MIGHTY TO RACE HERE
</P>
<P>
   It would take an act of God The Almighty to get a horse like
Mighty to show up for the $300,000 Lone Star Derby in April. It
would sort of be like lightning striking twice, but at least
trainer Frank Brothers is willing to consider it.
</P>
<P>
   Mighty, who won the Louisiana Derby with much authority last
weekend, is scheduled to make his next race in the Blue Grass
Stakes on April 15 at Keeneland. But Brothers won't let him run if
the track comes up muddy.
</P>
<P>
   Mighty wears ``rundown'' pads to protect the backs of his front
ankles from abrasions. He ran down when he raced on the mud last
year at Keeneland. He lost that race by more than 20 lengths.
</P>
<P>
   Brothers would put Mighty in the Lexington Stakes a week later
if he misses the Blue Grass. But if _ by an unlikely circumstance _
the forecast in the days leading up to the Lexington predict rain,
Brothers said he might make arrangements to come to Lone Star. It
would have to be horrendous weather, because the Lone Star Derby
and the Lexington are on the same day (April 22) and Brothers has
Mighty stabled in Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, I'd consider it,'' he said. ``He is nominated to the
race, and you have to keep all your options open.''
</P>
<P>
   Lone Star director of racing Larry Craft will be at the Tampa
Bay Derby on Saturday recruiting 3-year-olds for the Lone Star
Derby. Craft indicated that the only possibles for the Derby are
Oro Negra and Ifitstobeitsuptome (seventh and eighth, respectively,
in the Louisiana Derby). nn

IBM ACHIEVES ADVANCE IN MEMORY FOR COMPUTERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Calif.)  (js) 
 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A group of IBM scientists said Thursday that they had achieved a
technological breakthrough that could result in disk drives capable
of holding more than 1 trillion bytes of data _ more than 100 times
the capacity of today's most typical hard drives.
</P>
<P>
   In an article to be published Friday in the journal Science, the
researchers say they discovered chemical reactions that cause tiny
magnetic particles, each no larger than a few thousand atoms, to
assemble themselves at precise intervals like a company of soldiers
coming to attention on a parade ground.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery was made in a cross-country collaboration of
researchers working in IBM laboratories in New York state and
California. Beyond product applications, the breakthrough is
significant for the emerging scientific field of nanotechnology,
the effort to build microscopic circuitry and even machines only a
few molecules in size.
</P>
<P>
   One obstacle has been the difficulty of manufacturing such
precise magnetic surfaces, but IBM researchers are exploring
self-assembly _ chemical or mechanical processes that can be
programmed to build these minuscule technologies without human
intervention.
</P>
<P>
   Self-replication, the holy grail of nanotechnology, is widely
viewed as the key to an entirely new industrial era that may one
day replace modern microelectronic systems.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in the past year a variety of U.S. corporate and
academic laboratories have made progress in an area of research
known as molecular electronics, using a similar chemical approach
to build simple computing components no larger than a single
molecule.
</P>
<P>
   And academic researchers have made progress with the fabrication
of nanotubes, man-made carbon molecules capable of being assembled
into exotic materials that could contain their own processing power
_ a wall that becomes an entertainment center, for example, or
clothing that changes its thermal properties to compensate for
shifts in temperature or humidity.
</P>
<P>
   The IBM scientists said they had been able to assemble arrays of
particles so tiny that it would take 20,000 to span the width of a
human hair.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is exciting because it potentially applies to many
different types of small storage structures, not just rotating
memory,'' said Currie Munce, IBM Research's director of storage
systems and technology.
</P>
<P>
   IBM researchers in Zurich, for example, have been working on a
storage device that can read and write information to particles
that are only a few atoms wide.
</P>
<P>
   The current research was conducted by Shouheng Sun and
Christopher Murray at IBM's Thomas J. Watson Research Center in
Yorktown Heights, N.Y. and Dieter Weller, Liesl Folks and Andreas
Moser at the company's Almaden Research Center in San Jose, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   To create the new material the researchers combined iron- and
platinum-containing molecules in a heated solution.
</P>
<P>
   IBM executives cautioned that while the breakthrough is cause
for scientific excitement, it would not immediately translate into
the next generation of disk drives. It took almost a decade for IBM
to take its gigantic magneto resistive head technology from the
laboratory to the market, Munce said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   IBM has demonstrated storage densities up to 35.3 billion bits,
or gigabits, per square inch, and it is now shipping disks with
densities of 14.3 gigabits per square inch.
</P>
<P>
   The new magnetic nanoparticles could boost storage densities to
as high as 150 gigabits per square inch, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, IBM scientists have said they could continue to
improve disk densities until sometime this decade when they will
encounter a physical limit known as the ``superparamagnetic
effect'' _ a point at which the magnetic particles on the surface
of a disk will be so small that their magnetic orientation will
become unstable at room temperature. Munce said the new technology
would push disks closer to that limit.

SMALL FIRMS EXPRESS DISMAY AT PLAN FOR NASDAQ SPINOFF 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After months of breezy talk about a plan by the
National Association of Securities Dealers to issue stock and spin
off the Nasdaq stock market later this year, the fine print finally
became public Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   And though NASD executives predict that the deal will pass a
membership vote easily, a handful of small brokerage firms
expressed hostility to the offering in a conference call Thursday.
Another group may file a class-action suit to stop the deal.
</P>
<P>
   The voluminous offering statement explaining the two-part deal,
which is expected to raise $1.13 billion if it is fully subscribed,
was mailed earlier this week to the 5,509 brokerage firms that
belong to the membership organization. Phase 1 of the deal will
involve selling shares in the Nasdaq stock market. The second phase
will involve the sale of shares in NASD, the stock market's parent.
The offering will be put to a vote April 14.
</P>
<P>
   The prospectus outlined how the shares in the Nasdaq market
would be divided, with the largest share _ 32 percent _ going to
130 large brokerage firms that trade and underwrite Nasdaq stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Next in line are all other NASD member firms, with 25 percent,
followed by 130 companies whose shares trade on Nasdaq, which will
receive 16 percent of the deal. An undisclosed number of
institutional investors who own large stakes in Nasdaq-traded
companies will receive less than 5 percent. The NASD will own 51
percent of Nasdaq after the first phase of the deal and 22 percent
when the second phase is completed.
</P>
<P>
   The association said it would earmark up to $500 million from
the deal to be used by its regulatory arm and $215 million for the
benefit of the American Stock Exchange, which the NASD acquired in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   In the first conference call to discuss the deal with members
Thursday, the mood was contentious. According to several people who
took part in the 45-minute call, NASD executives allowed few
questions and were vague in their answers. ``Substantive questions
weren't answered,'' said an executive at one small firm who
insisted on anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Frank G. Zarb, chairman of the association, disagreed. ``It's
been generally a good response,'' he said. ``We're going to have
numerous more calls. Getting answers to questions really is
important to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Alan Davidson, president of the Independent Broker-Dealer
Association and a member of the association board, has recommended
that small brokerage firms vote against the deal. ``If approved,
this could be the end of one-firm, one-vote as we now know it in
the NASD,'' he said. ``As a result, large firms will be empowered,
and it will force a consolidation of small firms, which will give
investors fewer options and will create a severe imbalance in the
capital formation process for small business in the U.S.''
</P>
<P>
   A class-action suit against the NASD could come within a week,
said Howard Sirota, partner at Sirota &AMP; Sirota in New York. The
action would be brought by the Independent Broker-Dealer
Association on behalf of its 200-plus members, Sirota said.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The show is over and Marlo Thomas is ravenous: this
two-week stint co-starring in ``The Vagina Monologues'' tends to
whet the appetite, mental and physical. Lucky the pasta palace next
door keeps late hours. What with all the postperformance kudos,
feminist commiseration and air kissing (``Barry Diller came
tonight, and he loved it,'' Thomas informs her producer), supper
becomes synonymous with midnight snack.
</P>
<P>
   Finally she's back in her street clothes, a streamlined black
leather jacket atop leotard and pants, flashing her incandescent
crescent moon of a smile (none of that Mona Lisa stuff for her) at
the waitress, at the autograph-hunters, even at the photographer on
hand to snap an apres-show candid. ``But don't zoom in too close
with that thing,'' she implores. ``I've still got so much makeup
on, I probably look like a transvestite.''
</P>
<P>
   While Thomas, a Gloria Steinem pal whose history of
gender-equity activism put her on the A-list of the threesomes of
actresses recruited to replace ``Monologues'' creator Eve Ensler
onstage, is eager to talk about everything from virginity to the
impact her parents' marriage had on her _ ``My father was the boss
and she wasn't, and I didn't want that'' _ what she wants to do
first is order.
</P>
<P>
   What, no penne tonight, just farfalle? Only spaghetti and penne
were served in the Lebanese-Italian kitchen of her childhood in
Beverly Hills, where daddy, Danny Thomas (he died in 1991 but
continues to occupy prime psychic space in Thomas' conscience and
consciousness) made all the decisions and her mother handled the
details.
</P>
<P>
   As farfalle is all there is in this kitchen, she's game to pick
through a plate of that: there will be no pasta tantrums here.
Though show-biz lore has it that Thomas can be a bear, she
maintains she concentrates her tirades on things that matter. Like
battling the producers (male, of course) who insisted her signature
television show, ``That Girl,'' would never be a hit, that the
public couldn't care less about a career woman trying to make it on
her own.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas was starring in Mike Nichols' production of ``Barefoot in
the Park'' in London, and deep into a romance with her leading man,
Daniel Massey, when she learned her pilot had been bought; if it
hadn't, she suspects she might have lived a different life. No
stardom on American television. No high-profile Equal Rights
Amendment campaigning. No marriage (this May marks their 20th
anniversary) to the archetype of male feminists, the talk show host
Phil Donahue.
</P>
<P>
   ``If my show hadn't sold, I probably would have stayed in
London, married Danny Massey and become an English actress,'' she
reflects. ``I had said, `Why not do a show about a girl like me,
who wants to be an actress, moves to the big city and has a father
who doesn't want her to move to the big city because he's terrified
she'll lose her virginity,' as mine was,'' says Thomas with a
smile. ``It was too late, but he still worried.'' As did the
producers: Thomas' character remained single, but the scripts made
sure her beau was back in his own digs by bedtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``That Girl'' lasted five seasons, 1966-71, and has resurfaced
as a best-selling boxed set in the home video market. Four Emmys, a
Peabody and a Golden Globe later, Thomas, who has also collected
the ACLU's Thomas Paine Award and the Helen Caldicott Award for her
efforts for nuclear disarmament, is back in her favorite place: the
stage.
</P>
<P>
   For the last two weeks, Thomas has put her crimson pedicure on
display and, with two other barefoot divas, Rita Moreno and Cynthia
Nixon, clambered aboard a bar stool inside the appropriately
womb-like Westside Theater to share a 90-minute reverie about a
body part that would have made her blush back in her ``That Girl''
heyday. Not anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not anything you look through other glasses to
understand,'' says Thomas. ``Every woman in the place is laughing,
crying, gasping.'' And, oh yes, it's timely: ``Had Eve Ensler come
along 20 or 30 years ago and asked me what my vagina would wear if
it had a choice, I'd have thought she was some kind of weirdo.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas grew up in a privileged, patriarchal household where
women's sexual thoughts, much less their vaginas, were not
discussed. Her mother gave up a singing career to marry her father.
Her godmother, Loretta Young, never found a happy medium between
career and marriage, and of the 15 marriages she observed among
aunts and uncles, none gave the wife equal footing. Thomas, who got
an English degree at USC ``because my father insisted his kids get
a degree in something besides drama,'' was determined to put her
career first, and did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have always said, laughingly, that I'm my mother's
revenge,'' she says. ``I took the baton from my mother and ran with
it.'' She had her father's full support, but she ignored his career
advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd say, `I don't want you kids in show business, it's too
tough,' like it was the most suffering thing,'' she mimics. ``And
then I'd see him up on stage with his eyes twinkling and think,
`I've never seen my father so happy as when he's working.'''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas is happy when she's working, too. After this show, it's
on to play a witch in Disney's ``Bedknobs and Broomsticks,'' then a
CBS drama. And now it's time to hurry home to Donahue, ``the dream
guy to take home to your parents.'' And the considerate kind of guy
who always waits up.

SPITZER TRIES TO ORGANIZE GOVERNMENT GUN BUYERS TO PRESS FOR SAFETY
FEATURES 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ERIC LIPTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Saying that gun-control legislation and lawsuits against gun
manufacturers are taking too long, New York state's attorney
general, Eliot L. Spitzer, proposed Thursday that federal, state
and local governments across the country band together to try to
force gun makers to add safety devices to all weapons sold to
civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Gun manufacturers that did not agree to the coalition's demands
would lose their ability to sell guns to the local and state police
departments that sign on to the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer said that the mayors of Buffalo, Rochester, Albany and
East Aurora, as well as the Westchester County executive, had
already signed on to the campaign. He said he had sent letters to
attorneys general and governors across the United States and to the
mayors of the nation's 100 largest cities to ask for their support.
</P>
<P>
   ``A company that will be driven into bankruptcy because we will
deny it access to its primary market will respond in ways that
nobody thought of,'' Spitzer said, noting that federal, state and
local governments bought at least 25 percent of all handguns sold.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the details in the proposal, which Spitzer said he had
been working on for several months, overlap a plan announced two
days ago by Gov. George Pataki. Both proposals, for example, would
require that guns be sold with safety locks to prevent use or
accidental firing by a child. Spitzer, a Democrat, praised the
Republican governor for the gun-control legislation, which he said
he supports.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer said he was confident that within the next several
months he would have enough cities and states signed up for his
campaign to force gun manufacturers to agree to the terms. Until
then, he said, the attorney general's office would continue to buy
guns without regard to the proposed new code.
</P>
<P>
   But an industry representative said Thursday that he expected
the strategy to fail. Gun manufacturers ``absolutely will not be
forced or blackmailed into designing and marketing unsafe or
unproven firearms,'' said Bob Delfay, president of the National
Shooting Sports Foundation, a Connecticut-based organization that
represents 1,800 gun manufacturers, distributors and retailers
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Even the New York State Association of Chiefs of Police
expressed some reservations Thursday, given that the plan might
limit the ability of police departments to buy the guns they wanted
if a certain manufacturer did not agree to comply with the
requirements.
</P>
<P>
   ``Safety of officers and the public comes first,'' said John J.
Poklemba, a lawyer for the state association and the former New
York state director of criminal justice. ``Police departments need
the flexibility to buy the equipment that is appropriate for
them.''
</P>
<P>
   The so-called code of conduct that Spitzer has proposed is far
reaching. All handguns sold to civilians in the United States would
be required to have external and internal locking devices to
prevent accidental firing, as well as a device to alert a user if
there is a round in the chamber.
</P>
<P>
   Gun manufacturers would have to agree to refit old guns at no
cost to the owner, adding any new safety devices as they become
available. Handguns would have to be made in a way that allowed the
ammunition magazine to be removed.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers would also have to spend an amount equal to 1
percent of their annual sales to develop technology that prevented
a gun from being fired by anyone but the owner or another
authorized user.
</P>
<P>
   The code would also prohibit manufacturers from producing guns
that resisted fingerprints or that could easily be converted to
illegal firearms. The manufacturers would have to take steps to
ensure that the gun dealers it sold to did not distribute the guns
to groups that would resell them to convicted felons. Finally, the
gun manufacturers would have to agree to open their records to an
independent monitor who, with a staff of 50 to 70 people
nationwide, would be charged with ensuring that the manufacturers
complied with the rules.

 EXCERPTS FROM BUSH'S COMMENTS ABOUT McCAIN OVER THE COURSE OF TWO (Eds: please replace double parentheses (( )) with single
brackets)  
 (bl)  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Following are excerpts from an interview with Gov. George W.
Bush of Texas on Wednesday and from his comments at two separate
campaign events in Illinois on Thursday, as recorded by The New
York Times:
</P>
<P>
   Comments on Wednesday
</P>
<P>
   Q. Wasn't your message lost in fighting over tactics during
primaries? Can't that happen again if Gore acts as McCain did?
</P>
<P>
   BUSH: First of all, Al Gore is no John McCain. Please don't lump
John into that category. Secondly, I think John McCain is a person
that basically wanted to elevate the discourse and had a reason for
running, other than trying to tear somebody down.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Has John McCain elevated your consciousness about reform? Has
he changed your views?
</P>
<P>
   BUSH: No, he didn't change my views. He made me a better
candidate. Competition made me better. It forced me to play to my
strengths better. I didn't do that good a job early on. I needed to
make it more clear that I not only believe in reform, I've got the
record as a chief executive of getting reform done. There's nothing
like the humbling experience of getting whipped pretty bad in New
Hampshire to cause a man to re-evaluate. And I re-evaluated my
message and I re-evaluated how I was conducting myself as a
candidate. I wasn't doing as good a job as I could have explaining
where my strength is. And my strength is as somebody when, giving
the chance to reform, like education, I brought both Republicans
and Democrats together. That's what this country needs, when it
comes to Social Security, for example. When it's all said and done,
I think America's going to turn to me. I've got a record of doing
it. The Vice President is extremely partisan. He's extremely
partisan.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Is there anything McCain brought to light for you or changed
your opinion on in any way?
</P>
<P>
   BUSH: No, not really. We agreed more than we disagreed. That's
the great irony. You know, primaries are struggles; I used to say
primaries are arguments over shades of gray. And that's what makes
primaries difficult. In my case, I've known John a long time. And
battling with John wasn't all that pleasant, because I like him.
You know the competition got tough, and there were things said
during the course of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do you see the possibility of healing?
</P>
<P>
   BUSH: Yes, I do.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What do you need to do to make sure that happens?
</P>
<P>
   BUSH: Just remind him there's a lot of agreement. We agree on a
lot of things, starting with neither of us wants Al Gore to be the
president.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What about Al Gore's public life do you dislike so much?
</P>
<P>
   BUSH: I don't like the acrimony in Washington. I don't like the
zero-sum politics. I don't like pitting one group of people against
another. I don't like the way they've handled whether or not he
knew about raising money from the White House - you know, iced tea
and all these kinds of excuses. I think they ought to be more
forthcoming
</P>
<P>
   Q. You won the primaries and you don't have to make concessions
to McCain, but there are people out there urging it and calling for
it. . . .
</P>
<P>
   BUSH: Who's saying that?
</P>
<P>
   Q. His people are saying it, talking about intermediaries and
all that.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH: Well I've talked with Fred Thompson and John Kyl for
example and they said whatever I can do to help you become the
president, I want to help you.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Is there anything you need to do to win him over? Any
concessions you need to offer?
</P>
<P>
   BUSH: No. I think what I need to do is explain to John that we
agree a lot more than we disagree. There's a lot of room for reform
in Washington, D.C. I look forward to working with him to achieve
the reforms. Just to remind him that we can work together to get a
lot of reform done.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Any change in your positions, though?
</P>
<P>
   BUSH: No, I campaign on what I believe.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How critical to your future is it to patch things up?
</P>
<P>
   BUSH: Well, I think it's important for there to be some time. I
think it's important for all of us to get some rest. I think it's
important for us to realize that there's far more we agree on than
disagree on, and I'm confident we can work things out, confident
that we will be on the same team.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What do you think John McCain's role should be in the party?
</P>
<P>
   BUSH: I think that John McCain has earned the respect of a lot
of people, and it's going to be up to him to determine what course
he wants to take.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How important is it to win his enthusiastic support?
</P>
<P>
   BUSH: I'm confident we'll be able to find common ground and work
together.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How important?
</P>
<P>
   BUSH It's important, and I'm confident we can work together.
</P>
<P>
   ((Later he discussed the primary turnout thus far.))
</P>
<P>
   BUSH: I'm going to repeat: I'm very optimistic. I think if you
take an honest look at where this campaign is and where the party
is, we're pretty far down the road, consider that the turnout has
been huge. And the thing about the turnout that's important, there
are people who've been lying dormant as Republicans for a while and
there hasn't been much to cheer about, there's hasn't been much to
be excited about. And they're coming out.
</P>
<P>
   Q. But weren't they coming out for John McCain?
</P>
<P>
   BUSH Well then, how come he didn't win? Let me say this: I
remember the wisdom, you remember the wisdom in South Carolina, if
the turnout is bigger than 300,000. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Comments on Thursday:
</P>
<P>
   BUSH: I appreciate the hard campaign that John McCain waged. He
ran a good race. He highlighted the need for reform, and I
appreciate the ideas that he brought forth in the campaign. Of
course, he and I agree on a lot, and it starts with this: the best
reform for America is to end the Clinton/Gore in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   ((At a subsequent news conference he elaborated on his
comments.))
</P>
<P>
   Q. : Would you consider the possibility of compromise with
Senator McCain?
</P>
<P>
   BUSH: It's interesting. There's a story out today that doesn't
characterize how I feel. I want to show you a different newspaper
that says `Bush says he wants to work with McCain.' ((He holds up
front page of The Dallas Morning News.)) That's how I feel. I look
forward to working with Senator McCain. As I said in my speech, he
ran a good campaign. He brought forth some issues that are
important and I'm confident we can work together.
</P>
<P>
   Let me say where. For example, Social Security reform. John and
I both agree that there needs to be personal savings accounts
available for younger workers. . . . There's a lot of areas of
agreement; I know we can work together. . . .
</P>
<P>
   People want to focus on areas where we disagree, I'm going to
focus on areas where we agree . . . There's a lot of areas where we
can work together. In terms of budget reform, for example, I know
that John wants to reform the budget. I've laid out some plans. I
want to have biennial budgeting in the United States. I have a
two-year budget, so the budget bite doesn't go on every single
year. And that's going to require a lot of work together to get
that done.

CONNECTICUT LAWMAKERS ACT TO END CAMPFIRE BAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By PAUL ZIELBAUER   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ Hold your marshmallows. Put the lid on the
lighter fluid. Connecticut, perhaps the only state where lighting a
campfire is illegal, has become a land of unhappy campers and
downright dyspeptic campground owners.
</P>
<P>
   Because of an inadvertent change in a state statute last year,
campfires have been illegal since October. And though no campfire
police are sweeping the state's backwoods, the ban has thousands of
outdoor types wondering what kind of state they live in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of the advancement program of the Boy Scouts of America
is to build a fire,'' said Harry Pokorny, executive director of the
Scouts' Connecticut Rivers Council in Hartford. ``Without campfire
programs it will change the fellowship and team building of
scouting. They're going to have to use charcoal grills.''
</P>
<P>
   The good news for the Boy Scouts and others is that the ban is a
mistake, one that officials at the state's highest levels have
vowed to fix by the time guests begin to fill most campgrounds this
spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you think the governor is out to stop Boy Scouts from
having campfires?'' asked state Sen. Eileen Daily, a Democrat and
co-chairman of the legislature's Environment Committee, on
Thursday. ``I don't think so.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Daily's committee approved a bill that would make
campfires legal again. The legislature is expected to send it to
Gov. John G. Rowland as early as the end of the month, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The sooner the better. Asked how many complaints she has
received since the local news media have begun reporting the
glitch, Daily said, ``It would be in the hundreds.''
</P>
<P>
   Before last year, campfires, along with barbecues and other
recreational fires, were exempt from regulations requiring permits
for open fires, said Dennis Demchak, a director in the state
Department of Environmental Protection. But a change in a statute
regulating open fires eliminated the exemption, he said,
effectively removing campfires from the list of fires residents
could legally start.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because they were not mentioned, they were prohibited,''
Demchak said. And, he stressed, officials ``didn't intend to do
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with the Boy Scouts, the ban has inflamed some campground
owners, many of whom count on firewood sales as a revenue source.
</P>
<P>
   ``A campfire is a part of camping,'' said John Kelsey, a manager
of the Niantic by the Atlantic campground, in Niantic. ``You can't
have one without the other.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelsey said the imbroglio would be a popular topic at this
year's convention of Northeastern campground owners, which he was
attending Thursday in Stockbridge, Mass. ``This is going to be a
huge topic tonight at dinner,'' he said.

EUGENE ROBIN, 80, EDUCATOR DEDICATED TO TEACHING PATIENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich., Calif.)   (bl)  
 By NICK RAVO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Eugene D. Robin, a medical professor, researcher and
advocate of patient rights and education, died March 8 in a
hospital in Eureka, Calif. He was 80 and lived in Trinidad, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death was complications from cancer, said his wife,
Jane.
</P>
<P>
   Robin was the author of ``Matters of Life and Death'' (Stanford
University Press, 1984), a widely used guide for patients weighing
the risks and benefits of treatments. He also wrote a medical
column for The Riverside Press Enterprise and The San Francisco
Examiner from 1986 to 1990.
</P>
<P>
   From 1971 to 1974, Robin was chairman of the pulmonary advisory
committee of the National Heart and Lung Institute, part of the
National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md. From 1970 to 1971,
he also served as president of the American Thoracic Society.
</P>
<P>
   Robin was acting chairman of the Stanford University School of
Medicine from 1976 to 1977 and acting chairman of the department of
physiology at Stanford from 1977 to 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Eugene Debs Robin was born on Aug. 23, 1919, in Detroit. He
received bachelor's, masters and medical degrees from George
Washington University and worked at Walter Reed General Hospital in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, he is survived by a son, Donald, of San
Diego; a daughter, Anna R. Lundstrom of Philadelphia; a sister,
Ruth Boothby of St. Louis; three step-sons: Scott Heaslet of
Spencer, Ind., Richard Heaslet of Petaluma, Calif. and Barry
Heaslet of Kneeland, Calif.; a stepdaughter, Debra Jorgensen of Los
Altos, Calif., and three grandchildren.

SPORTS COLUMN: THORNTON KEEPS PEACE ON THE COURT FOR ST. JOHN'S
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md., Fla.)   (rk) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON, Ariz. _ Late Wednesday evening Darlene Grimes was
talking about the hectic week she had already had. While her son,
Bootsy Thornton, is in Tucson with St. John's in the NCAA
basketball tournament, Grimes was back in Baltimore, where she is a
medical assistance specialist.
</P>
<P>
   Grimes goes from hospital to hospital helping patients fill out
insurance paperwork. The hardest part this week has been carrying
around the heavy silver trophy her son won last week as the Big
East tournament's most valuable player.
</P>
<P>
   The trophy has become a great conversation piece. On Monday she
took it to Johns Hopkins University Hospital, where doctors, nurses
and patients admired it and offered their congratulations. Then
Tuesday it was off to Liberty Medical Center. Thursday she was
taking it to Union Memorial Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took it with me when I got my shoes repaired,'' she said,
laughing.
</P>
<P>
   In each place, faces lighted up because Darlene Grimes' face was
glowing. This was a happy story. Thornton was born in East
Baltimore, where he attended Dunbar High School and played for the
school's famed basketball program. He played at Tallahassee
Community College for two seasons before coming to St. John's. His
success is the story of a Baltimore youngster's thriving.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means a lot to me that he's made it this far,'' his mother
said by telephone. ``Since he was 8 years old this has been his
dream. He wanted to play college basketball, wanted to play in the
NBA. I wanted him to get a good education and be an artist. I never
thought he'd get this close.''
</P>
<P>
   What she is most proud of, she said, is her son's independent
mind. Earlier in the season, when teammates wore Band-Aids on their
cheeks to commemorate Erick Barkley's NCAA suspension, Thornton
went Band-Aid-less. With so many athletes sporting diamond studs in
their ears, Thornton refuses.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for Thornton, a remarkable senior season _ one
that included a dramatic basket to beat Duke _ has been
overshadowed by NCAA investigations and daily disclosures
surrounding Barkley, his backcourt mate. For all his on-court
accomplishments, Thornton achieved national attention last weekend
for a locker-room altercation. He and Barkley exchanged heated
words at halftime of a Big East tournament semifinal game. Pushes
nearly came to shoves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made the paper that day,'' Thornton said with a hint of
humor. ``No matter how many good games I had, I never seemed to
make the back page; but one little negative thing happened and I
get headlines, `Erick and Bootsy Fight.' That bothered me a
little.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he and Barkley are friends, not just teammates. ``If
it's just on court and not off the court, it carries over on the
court,'' he said. ``So you have to have a great off-the-court
relationship as well as on-court.''
</P>
<P>
   Thornton's real first name is Marvis. His mother, who separated
from Bootsy's father and was married several years ago, said when
she was pregnant she and Bootsy's father had debates over how they
would name the baby. ``At first he said he wanted the name Marvis,
because his name is Marvis and his father's name is Marvis; then he
said he didn't care,'' she said. ``I was thinking about naming him
Teon Terrell Thornton.''
</P>
<P>
   His father changed his mind again. ``So we named him Marvis
Thornton III,'' Grimes said. ``But I just couldn't call him Marvis.
So I tried to come up with different nicknames.''
</P>
<P>
   She settled on one inspired by Bootsy Collins, the trendsetting
bass player for Parliament-Funkadelic, the band that laid the
foundation for generations of rappers. ``I really liked him,'' she
said. ``I remembered songs he made that I liked, like
``Flashlight.'''
</P>
<P>
   Thornton is familiar with his namesake. ``I know he was back in
the day with George Clinton and everybody; people going to
concerts, wearing shiny suits,'' he said. ``Bootsy Collins wearing
those big star glasses _ that's what caught my attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Two decades later the nickname is fitting. Thornton has assumed
the bass player's role for St. John's. He moves without the ball,
deftly uses space, and has an economy of movement that keeps the
offense going. When nerves begin to fray, the understated Thornton,
standing in the back of the rhythm section, exhorts teammates to
keep a cool head, to channel the anger and frustration into the
game.

<P>
   ``I've always been the quiet, behind-the-scenes guy _ a calm guy
who gets the job done,'' he said. So far it has worked. The tempest
continues, the investigation continues. Bootsy Thornton is still
keeping steady time.

HUSBAND WILL BEHAVE IF FREED ON BAIL, GOTTI DAUGHTER SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ALAN FEUER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Telling a federal judge that she runs ``an extremely
tight ship at home,'' Victoria Gotti promised Thursday to keep her
husband, Carmine Agnello, in line if he is released from custody on
charges of racketeering in the scrap metal industry.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing at Agnello's bail hearing in U.S. District Court in
Brooklyn, Gotti, the daughter of John J. Gotti, the former boss of
the Gambino crime family, told the court that as an author of
popular mystery novels, she works at home and would be around to
make sure Agnello abided by the terms of any bail agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many ways, you would be on hand to act as a sort of
policeman, would you not?'' Agnello's lawyer, Jay Goldberg, asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I run an extremely tight ship at home,'' Gotti replied. ``So,
yes, I guess I would.''
</P>
<P>
   Agnello, whom prosecutors describe as a ``made member'' of the
Gambino family, was arrested in January on state charges of using
mob intimidation to attract customers to his scrap metal empire
around Shea Stadium in Queens.
</P>
<P>
   On March 6, he was accused of similar charges in a federal
indictment. He has been in jail since then.
</P>
<P>
   Bridget M. Rohde, an assistant U.S. attorney, argued that
Agnello should not be freed on bail because after his release on
the state indictment, he threatened a government witness by making
``an Italian gesture of death'' _ a hand held sideways with the
index finger and pinky extended like horns.
</P>
<P>
   Agnello took the witness stand and, in rapid, mumbling tones,
denied having made threats of any kind.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg told Magistrate Robert M. Levy that Gotti would follow
the most stringent terms of a bail agreement, saying she would
agree to an extremely narrow list of people who could visit the
couple's home because she is an author who cherishes her solitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a writer, you understand that the less people who come
to visit, the better off you are, correct?'' Goldberg asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I agree,'' Gotti said.
</P>
<P>
   Levy is expected to decide Friday whether to release Agnello. &QL;

FRED KELLY, 83, A DANCER IN A SHADOW 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., N.J., N.Y., Calif., Ala., Ariz.)  (lh) 
 By DOUGLAS MARTIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fred Kelly, a producer, director, choreographer and dance
instructor who taught his brother Gene to tap-dance _ not to
mention polishing young John Travolta's early moves _ died of
cancer on Wednesday in Tucson, Ariz. He was 83.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly, who appeared on Broadway and in movies and was one of the
first directors and performers in the new medium of television, had
a major advantage and a major disadvantage: Gene Kelly, a legend of
dance and his older brother. Gene, to put it mildly, cast a big
shadow.
</P>
<P>
   Gene's earthy, graceful masculinity was the perfect counterpoint
to Fred Astaire's studied elegance in lavish Hollywood musicals.
Fred Kelly's style and personal presence were remarkably similar to
his brother's, and the effect was exhilarating the one time they
danced together in a movie, the ``I Love to Go Swimmin' With
Wimmen'' scene in the 1954 film ``Deep in My Heart.''
</P>
<P>
   But Fred resisted Gene's entreaties to follow him to Hollywood,
preferring the stage, whether on Broadway or in a high school
auditorium, and family life in suburban Closter, N.J., where he
could be active in groups like the Knights of Columbus and serve on
the First Aid Squad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody knew who Gene was, but everybody knew Fred,''
Michael Kelly, Fred's son, said.
</P>
<P>
   The two brothers were always close, with Gene often calling Fred
to consult on dance problems. But Fred never tired of teasing Gene
about the special screening of ``An American in Paris'' in London
in 1951. Queen Elizabeth II jumped the receiving line and rushed up
to Gene, the film's star.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, Mr. Kelly, is it true you are the brother of Fred Kelly?''
she asked breathlessly.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out that Fred, as an Army sergeant assigned to a
traveling dance unit, had given Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret
ballroom dancing lessons. At their insistence, he also sneaked in
some cancan instruction. When the princesses later performed in
costumes deemed too revealing, Kelly was almost busted to private.
</P>
<P>
   The story suggests the level of celebrity with which Kelly was
comfortable, as well as his record of accomplishment. He had been
referred to the royal family by Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower, who
considered taking tap-dance lessons from him. Then the general
decided painting would be a better activity, in part because it
would be easier to disguise that he was taking time off from
running the war to relax.
</P>
<P>
   No matter. Kelly's dance shoes hung on the Wall of Fame at New
York City's Roseland Ballroom, which gave him credit for
introducing the cha-cha to America and popularizing the mambo here.
His imprint as a young instructor in Pittsburgh, and in his later
life in New Jersey, is still visible in the rhythms of thousands,
including Travolta, who studied at Kelly's dance studio in Oradell,
N.J., as a child. The studio operated for 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   Fredric N. Kelly was born in Pittsburgh on June 29, 1916, the
youngest of five children: Joan, James, Eugene, Louise and Fred.
His father, James Patrick Kelly, was a sales executive with
Columbia Phonograph Co. According to Fred's reminiscences, his
father, as the personal representative of Thomas Edison, sent
hundreds of rail cars to the Midwest with the first phonographs and
records to reach that part of the country.
</P>
<P>
   His mother, Harriet, performed as a hobby with a local stock
company and insisted that all her children take music and dance
lessons. Fred began performing at the age of 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played Baby New Year,'' he said. ``When everybody started
hollering and throwing confetti, I thought it was for me.''
</P>
<P>
   The children began performing around 1921 as the Five Dancing
Kellys In a signature routine, each Kelly child said a letter of
the family name. ``I remember the orchestra cracked up, laughing
even at rehearsals,'' Fred recalled. ``My big sister had the K, my
brother James had the E, Gene had the L, my other sister had the
other L and then I came in with the Y whenever I felt like it. It
wasn't at all with the music; I just took a big breath and yelled
Y.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only was Fred perceived as the family ``cutie pie,'' but he
was also the family's natural tap dancer. By the time he was 8 he
was earning as much as $50 a month as a performer, good money even
for an adult in 1924. It was Fred who taught Gene tap, so Gene
could earn extra money for college.
</P>
<P>
   When a dance school where the Kelly children were enrolled
failed, their mother scraped together money to pay its bills and
took it over. Soon Gene and Fred were the main teachers, pushing
hundreds of students through 20-minute assembly-line lessons.
Shirley Temple's popularity fueled the business.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to performing in Pittsburgh, Fred performed every
summer from the 8th through 12th grades on a showboat that played
Mississippi and Ohio River ports from Pittsburgh to New Orleans.
Corny comedy was a specialty.
</P>
<P>
   Fred graduated from the University of Pittsburgh, where he
became the first member of the family to appear in films, as the
panther mascot to Pitt's football team. He then joined Gene in New
York. When Gene had to give up his part in the Theater Guild's
production of ``The Time of Your Life'' to take the title role in
the Broadway stage production of ``Pal Joey,'' he recommended that
Fred replace him.
</P>
<P>
   With the permission of the play's author, William Saroyan, Fred
increased his character's dance scenes to 11 from 6. His
performance earned three Donaldson Awards, precursors of the Tony.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II he performed in Irving Berlin's ``This Is
the Army,'' which began on Broadway with a cast of 300 American
servicemen and toured the world.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Kelly married Dorothy Greenwalt during rehearsals for the
Broadway opening of the Army show. He took her around the corner
and introduced her to the company of ``Best Foot Forward.'' The
writers, Hugh Martin and Ralph Blaine, quizzed her on how the
couple met.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just adored the boy next door,'' she said, explaining that
they were neighbors on Kensington Street in Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   The conversation was immortalized in the Martin and Blaine song
``The Boy Next Door,'' which Judy Garland sang in ``Meet Me in St.
Louis.'' The lyrics include their actual addresses, 7514 and 7520
Kensington Street, but each has the other's in the song, for the
purposes of rhyme.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The woman everyone called Dottie died in 1995, a year before
Gene. In addition to his son, Michael, of Valencia, Calif., Kelly
is survived by two sisters, Harriet Joan Radvansky of Pittsburgh
and Louise Bailey of Dothan, Ala.; a daughter, Colleen Beaman of
Tucson; and eight grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   After the war Kelly was hired by NBC to direct television shows,
including ``The Steve Allen Show'' and ``The Colgate Comedy Hour.''
He choreographed and directed the Ice Capades for three years and
choreographed at the Latin Quarter nightclub for star acts.
</P>
<P>
   While still working for the Latin Quarter, he choreographed a
show for a competing club, Havana Madrid. Working with the great
Latin band leader Tito Puente, or so the very plausible story goes,
he put together a Latin number based on the Lindy, except that the
dancers moved sideways. They threw in a cry for the orchestra:
``cha cha cha!''
</P>
<P>
   Thus, it is said, on Aug. 2, 1948, the cha-cha was introduced to
America. But its prophet was identified as Frederico Calais
(allegedly Gaelic for Kelly), to disguise Kelly's moonlighting.
Years later, as McGowan tells it, the Smithsonian Institution
called Kelly asking for help in finding Calais to record the
achievement properly.

BEHOLD, THE FRAGRANT JAPANESE MAN! 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: This story was sent and then held March 3; it is now
released for publication. Note that this version is a rewrite and
has been updated.)

<P>
   OSAKA, Japan _ Daijiro Karasawa, a 49-year-old auditor, never
gave the matter much thought until he witnessed a small drama on
the bullet train.
</P>
<P>
   Karasawa saw two college women laughing and holding their noses
as a businessman, about his age, walked down the aisle looking for
a seat.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, a defensive Karasawa bought a designer cologne
that he now rubs on his wrists and behind his ears before his
frequent trips between Osaka and Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a very clean person, and in my mind I know that I don't
smell,'' Karasawa said. ``But I'm wearing fragrance for the first
time in my life, to eliminate any chance that I might offend
someone.''
</P>
<P>
   Karasawa volunteered the information after a reporter asked him
to translate a newspaper ad for a line of cosmetics boasting a
secret ingredient that supposedly reduces a body odor that afflicts
older people.
</P>
<P>
   The experience of Karasawa is like that of many other men in
this hyper-hygienic nation.
</P>
<P>
   The trend started after Japan's largest cosmetics maker,
Shiseido, discovered a substance that causes body odor in people
over 40, and particularly middle-aged men. That discovery has led
to a whole range of lucrative products. For Shiseido, the product
introduction, which it says is not limited in appeal to men over
40, was one of the most successful in its history.
</P>
<P>
   Shoji Nakamura, the Shiseido perfumer who discovered the
offending agent, called noneal, said, ``Our data shows that older
women and men produce the same amount but that we smell more odor
coming from men, because they tend to be less hygienic.''
</P>
<P>
   In September, Shiseido introduced a line of shampoos, lotions
and deodorants to curb the breakdown of the fatty acid in skin that
causes noneal.
</P>
<P>
   Noneal, described as having a ``greasy, grassy odor,'' is rarely
found in the body odor of people in their 20s and 30s, the
researchers say, but increases in volume and strength with aging.
</P>
<P>
   Shiseido said that sales of the new product line, called Care
Garden, had been more than five times its initial target.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's mainly salary men in their 50s who are buying it,'' said
Kyoko Asakura, manager for Matsumoto Kiyoshi, a discount drugstore
in the Ginza, Tokyo's premier shopping district. ``Many of them
come into the store and shyly ask for the product that takes away
old man's smell.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Gunze Ltd. _ known for its line of sweat-free men's underwear _
conducted a survey in which 90 percent of the women responding
wanted men to ``do something'' about their smell.
</P>
<P>
   Miki Ishimoto, a 21-year-old student, said she disliked touching
a subway strap after an older man, or ojisan, had handled it. And
if an ojisan should brush up against her, ``I feel so contaminated
that I immediately go to wash myself,'' Ishimoto said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Like Americans, Japanese are happy to make consumer products
companies rich by spending money on every sort of nostrum to
bolster one's social appeal. Everywhere one looks in Japan, for
instance, in magazines, newspapers and store windows and on
billboards and television, there are advertisements for products
that rid the body of odor.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Arden is marketing the Lip Lip Hooray line of
lipsticks that contains citric acid, which the company says
neutralizes the sulfuric compounds that can cause halitosis.
</P>
<P>
   The SSK Corp. has a line of T-shirts that contain deodorant
fibers that it says eliminates odors when exposed to the sun's
ultraviolet rays.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone thinks Japan's preoccupation is healthy. Koichiro
Fujita, a professor of immunology at Tokyo Medical and Dental
University, said that while the Japanese have long been attentive
to personal hygiene, they have become ``slaves to smell,'' snarled
by the barrage of advertising by deodorant producers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The marketers have brainwashed people to be afraid of their
own smell, which is supposed to be something natural, something
that as a living creature is a way of asserting I am here,'' Fujita
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our country is suffering from super cleanliness syndrome, and
it's so extreme that even elementary school children are afraid
they will be teased or bullied.''
</P>
<P>
   Fujita said that too much cleanliness actually reduced the
body's ability to fight infections and that some bacteria was
valuable. His book, ``Cleanliness Is a Sickness,'' has sold 30,000
copies.
</P>
<P>
   But Harueko Kato, a sociologist at Tokyo Women's Christian
University, sees nothing to complain about.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before these products were created, the norm for Japanese men
was to wear that awful smelling hair tonic,'' and that was the
extent of their grooming, she said. ``Today, whether it's in the
office, subway trains, or at home, Japanese men want to be liked,
so they are trying to improve their image, and I think it's
great.''

CENTRAL CONNECTICUT TESTS IOWA STATE
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ They stared up at the giant scoreboard hanging
from the ceiling, still hoping. One, two, three heads popped up
from Central Connecticut State's huddle wanting to believe that
they still had a chance to shock Iowa State and the college
basketball world.
</P>
<P>
   But the chance that had been very real five and a half minutes
earlier when the score was tied had evaporated. The Blue Devils
were 30 seconds from losing to Iowa State, 88-78, in the first
round of the NCA A tournament's Midwest Regional at the Metrodome,
so looking at the scoreboard provided no hope, regardless of how
many heads popped up from the huddle.
</P>
<P>
   No one expected this game between the second-seeded Cyclones and
the 15th-seeded Blue Devils to be competitive. Central Connecticut
was behind by 19 points in the first half, and coach Howie
Dickenman warned his players that they were looking at the
possibility of a 50-point blowout. No one expected a comeback, but
it came. The comeback came because the Blue Devils (25-6) played
harder and smarter and the Cyclones (30-4), who play Auburn next,
on Saturday, relaxed too early.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had to play this game again, I wouldn't want to play
them again,'' Iowa State's Marcus Fizer said. ``They were really
anxious to beat us.''
</P>
<P>
   Iona felt the same way about Maryland. Like Central Connecticut,
the 14th-seeded Gaels were trying pull off an upset. But they were
pummeled, 74-59, to finish their season in a frustrating manner.
</P>
<P>
   When the Iowa State game was over, Fizer, the All-American who
had muscled his way to 27 points against a 2-3 matchup zone,
located the Central Connecticut starters, shook their hands and
patted them on their heads. Fizer looked exhausted with sweat
pouring off his bald head and his arms dangling by his sides. More
than exhausted, Fizer looked relieved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Great game,'' Fizer told the Blue Devils. ``Great game.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Central Connecticut wanted more. When Dickenman and three
players trudged into the interview area, Rick Mickens (19 points)
and Victor Payne had moist eyes and John Tice (21 points) answered
questions as if he were undergoing root canal work.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Devils wondered what might have happened if they had
not fallen behind by 18 points only eight minutes into the game in
their first NCAA tournament appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tied the score, 69-69, and that's all fine and dandy, but
we lost the basketball game,'' Dickenman said. ``That was a
winnable basketball game for us.''
</P>
<P>
   After Mickens streaked in for a layup to even the score, 69-69,
with 6 minutes 13 seconds left, the 50 fans who had trekked from
New Britain, Conn., to see the Blue Devils hugged and high-fived in
their seats. The Blue Devils' mascot, who was in his third game
ever because the school did not have a costume until this month,
clapped. Iowa State, not wanting to become just the fourth No.
2-seeded team to falter in the first round, frowned.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next five possessions, the Cyclones uncorked a 12-0
burst.
</P>
<P>
   Jamaal Tinsley, the Brooklyn native who did not play high school
basketball, was the reason the Cyclones prevailed, not Fizer.
</P>
<P>
   Tinsley, who slithered inside for 26 points and six assists and
also had six rebounds and four steals, started the run with a
driving layup and finished it by swishing a 3-pointer. The Cyclones
were 5 for 7 in those fateful four minutes, while the Blue Devils
were 0 for 3 with a turnover. Fizer was 0 for 0.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won the game and they kept the ball out of my hands,''
Fizer said. ``It proves it's not just me making the shots.''
</P>
<P>
   After Tomas Brookins' running 3-pointer at the buzzer sliced
Central Connecticut's deficit to nine points at halftime, Dickenman
gave an impassioned speech. He challenged his players to dive for
loose balls, to prevent transition baskets and to play defense for
35 seconds of every possession. But his team did not do enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no moral victories,'' Dickenman said. ``We came here
to win this basketball game. We didn't come to play close.''
</P>
<P>
   In the first game, Auburn built an 18-point bulge over Creighton
in the second half but then needed Mamadou N'Diaye to block Ben
Walker's 3-point attempt with 2 seconds remaining to win. The
seventh-seeded Tigers (24-9) gave the 10th-seeded Blue Jays (23-10)
a chance to even the score when Daymeon Fishback inexplicably
tossed a full-court pass to N'Diaye that sailed over the 7-footer's
head. The Blue Jays got the ball back under their basket with 3.8
seconds left. They inbounded the ball to Walker, who had to turn
and hoist up a shot that N'Diaye's long arm swatted away.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game should have been over,'' Auburn coach Cliff Ellis
said. ``I'm glad that we survived.''
</P>
<P>
   Auburn played without Chris Porter, its best player, who was
suspended by the NCAA for accepting $2,500 from an agent. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Before the game was nine minutes old, Maryland led by 23-4. At
one point in the first half, Iona went more than nine minutes in
which the Gaels scored just one field goal. Iona shot 33.3 percent
from the field for the game, including 4 of 19 from beyond the
3-point arc. It is obvious why Maryland (25-9) romped.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's disappointing the way we started,'' said coach Jeff
Ruland. ``The way we started, instead of like Cinderella, it was
more like Tinkerbell.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Gaels (20-11) chopped the deficit to nine on Tariq
Kirksay's layup with six and a half minutes remaining in the first
half, the Terrapins were never in danger of relinquishing the lead.
Maryland was bigger, quicker and more confident, which is why the
Terrapins cruised on a night when they made 21 turnovers. Terence
Morris had 22 points for Maryland, which will play the winner of
UCLA-Ball State on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   After Ruland called a timeout in the second half, he was so
disappointed that he shouted ``that's embarrassing.'' But Ruland
complimented his team after the loss for rebounding from a 6-9
start this season and praised Kirksay, who scored 24 in his final
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never gave up, we turned it around,'' said Kirksay, whose
voice choked up as he bowed his head and wept.

   A CHALLENGER FOR KENNEDY
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts has accumulated a hefty
$3.6 million in his re-election fund. And that money, along with
the Kennedy name and 38 years of incumbency, were enough Thursday
to scare off one potential Republican foe, District Attorney
Michael Sullivan of Plymouth County.
</P>
<P>
   But no sooner had Sullivan said that he would not run than
another Republican, Jack E. Robinson III, announced that he would
take on the senator. In fact, Robinson, a 39-year-old cell phone
entrepreneur, said he planned to use up to $1 million of his own
money to run.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's absolutely a long shot,'' he conceded. ``We're the
underdog. But at the end of the day, ideas are going to win out.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, a Boston-born African-American whose father once
headed the city's NAACP chapter, is seeking to be the third
popularly elected African-American U.S. senator. He has never held
political office. But state Republican leaders see him as the
party's last best hope as a Kennedy challenger, in part because the
state has a strong civil rights record but also because they
believe his fiscally conservative, socially moderate approach to
politics, including support for abortion rights, will appeal to a
broad spectrum of Massachusetts voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to be reaching out not only to Republicans, but to
Democrats and independents as well,'' said John Brockelman,
executive director of the Massachusetts Republican Party. ``He's
going to run under the Republican reform banner.''
</P>
<P>
   If elected, Robinson would be the second black Republican to
represent Massachusetts in the Senate; Edward Brooke served two
terms, 1967 to 1979.
</P>
<P>
   PUSH FOR UNION CANDIDATES
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ John J. Sweeney, the AFL-CIO president, came to New
York Thursday to promote an ambitious effort by big labor to have
at least 2,000 union members run for office nationwide this year,
from campaigns for school boards to campaigns for Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Too many of the nation's elected officials, he said, come from
big wealth, with at least 1 of every 4 members of Congress being a
millionaire. But, he declared at a news conference, big labor's
``2,000 in 2000'' program would help rectify that by ensuring that
the voices of the less well off were represented in the halls of
power.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our program,'' Sweeney said, ``aims to change the face of
elected America and make sure working families' voices are heard by
running union members for office.''
</P>
<P>
   BUSH APPOINTEES AND MESSAGE WIN
</P>
<P>
   Two of Gov. George W. Bush's minority appointees won Republican
primaries in Texas on Tuesday, giving a boost to his effort to make
his party more inclusive in the Lone Star state and also providing
some underpinning to his assertion that as president he would be an
inclusive leader.
</P>
<P>
   Neither faces Democratic opposition in the fall, so both are
assured final victory.
</P>
<P>
   They are Michael Williams, who won election to the Texas
Railroad Commission in his own right, having earlier been given an
interim appointment by the governor, and Al Gonzales, who won a
seat on the state Supreme Court in his own right after an interim
appointment by the governor.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who served earlier as Bush's secretary of state, is an
African-American, the first ever to win a nonjudicial statewide
election in Texas. Gonzales is Latino.
</P>
<P>
   During the campaign, Bush appeared in television commercials
supporting both.

DOROTHY DAY IN FIRST STEP TO SAINTHOOD 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Vatican has approved starting the process by
which Dorothy Day, a 20th-century American pacifist and advocate
for the poor, might be canonized as a saint of the Roman Catholic
Church.
</P>
<P>
   Day, a Brooklyn native who died 20 years ago at 83, was a
founder of the Catholic Worker movement, which aided the poor and
the homeless. She lived in voluntary poverty and described herself
as a conservative in matters of the church and a radical on issues
like equal rights for blacks and opposition to war.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to begin the process toward sainthood followed a
request by Cardinal John O'Connor, archbishop of New York. It was
announced Thursday in the cardinal's column on the archdiocese's
Internet site (www.ny-archdiocese.org).
</P>
<P>
   ``With this approval comes the title Servant of God'' for Day,
he wrote. ``What a gift to the church in New York and to the church
universal this is!''
</P>
<P>
   The cardinal wrote to the Vatican on Feb. 7 to begin the lengthy
process of investigating the person's life and reviewing the
findings at the local level and in Rome.
</P>
<P>
   Day converted to Catholicism in 1927, after the birth of her
daughter. Before that, in her 20s, she wrote for a Socialist
newspaper and lived a Bohemian life in New York. After her
conversion, she rejected the idea of class struggle and emphasized
the dignity of the individual.
</P>
<P>
   In 1933, with Peter Maurin, a French philosopher of peasant
background, she founded the Catholic Worker movement to aid the
poor and homeless. They opened a shelter and food distribution
center on the Lower East Side of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   In his letter, O'Connor wrote that he believed Day to have been
a saint, ``a modern-day, devoted daughter of the church,'' who
wanted attention not for herself but for the work of helping the
poor. ``Much of what she spoke of in terms of social justice
anticipated the teachings of Pope John Paul II and lends support to
her cause,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The cardinal said he considered her a model for everyone, ``but
especially for women who have had or are considering abortion.''
Day had an abortion before her conversion, he wrote, adding, ``She
regretted it every day of her life.'' The conversion, he said,
demonstrated God's mercy and how one might turn from what he
described as ``the ultimate act of violence against innocent life
in the womb to a position of total holiness and pacifism.''

LAKERS BENCH WILL BE A BOOM TOWN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON - Phil Jackson is relieved not to face a $100,000
fine for defying a league order to wear a microphone, but he's not
thrilled with the league's compromise solution - the placement of a
boom mike near the bench during timeouts.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers will have to contend with that policy Sunday, when
they play for an NBC audience against the New York Knicks at
Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have gone willingly to slaughter like the rest of
these guys,'' Jackson said of refusing to wear a mike and taking
the fine, ``because it was something we had to stand up for.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson had indicated all along that he wouldn't wear a
microphone, but he hadn't faced the prospect yet. Then the league -
after heavy criticism from coaches, fans and even media - backed
off after Toronto coach Butch Carter and Seattle coach Paul
Westphal refused to wear mikes earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson is wary of the boom mike but said it won't be as
effective with his team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always have a mobile huddle. That's one of the things that
I've been known for,'' he said, ``so it (won't be) as intrusive in
my huddles as it has been in others, because my huddles are very
unexciting, and perhaps have the worst in the league as far as
huddles go.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson always huddles separately with his coaches - on the
floor - while the players meet near the bench, where the boom mike
would be. Then they all come together at the end of the timeout.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can sit with boom mikes on these players and the cameras
in their faces while they're venting or whatever's going on (among)
the teammates,'' Jackson said, ``and that's a really, pretty
private situation too, because our players are very animated to
each other, very encouraging and sometimes they're jostling with
each other or chiding each other. So I think that it still is
invasive as far as I'm concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan rules: Wizards president Michael Jordan watched his team
beat his former coach from an MCI Center luxury suite, ending a
three-week span in which he didn't attend a single game. Jordan has
endured some criticism for the absence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I agree entirely with his position of not being here after the
(Feb. 24) trading deadline,'' Jackson said. ``He wants to see how
these players do on their own. I think him being here might
motivate them; he wants to see who's self-motivated. I can
understand that very easily.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Jordan: ``They all knew I was coming. If I'm here or not
here, you still got to go out and do your jobs. That's the thing
they really have to understand. If they have to wait and have me
look over their shoulders, they're not the players that I think
should represent this organization.''

   Lakers (53-11) update: They've beaten the Pistons three times in
a row and have a six-game winning streak at Detroit. The Lakers are
17-1 on the second night of back-to-backs, winning the last 11 in a

CHRIS-CRAFT LOSES UPN RULING, BOOSTING VIACOM IN CBS BID 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A state Supreme Court justice has upheld an ultimatum
that Chris-Craft Industries has to buy or sell its interest in the
fledgling UPN network by Monday, giving Viacom Inc. a big victory
in its quest to complete its merger with CBS Corp.
</P>
<P>
   UPN, which was started five years ago, is a 50-50 partnership
between Viacom and Chris-Craft.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Herman Cahn ruled Thursday against all of Chris-Craft's
motions to thwart a buy-sell provision initiated by Viacom and CBS.
</P>
<P>
   The provision would force Chris-Craft to sell its interest in
UPN for $5 million, meaning it would gain no value for the asset it
has tried to build up for the last five years or else buy the
network for the same figure, and assume all future losses by the
network. To date UPN has lost about $800 million.
</P>
<P>
   Though Chris-Craft does have the right to appeal to the state
appellate division, one executive involved in the legal action said
that even an appeal would be unlikely to delay the execution of the
buy-sell provision by more than a few days. A lawyer for
Chris-Craft, Peter Fishbein, did not return phone calls Thursday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Chris-Craft had argued that Viacom violated a noncompete
provision of the companies' joint venture agreement when it moved
to acquire CBS, a network competitor of UPN. The judge disagreed
and refused to grant an injunction blocking the Viacom-CBS merger
or the enactment of the buy-sell agreement.
</P>
<P>
   After talks about a possible acquisition of Chris-Craft proved
fruitless, Viacom and CBS invoked the buy-sell provision in
February, setting in motion a 45-day deadline for Chris-Craft to
either buy or sell its interest in UPN. Unless the appeals court
grants a delay, Chris-Craft will have to make its decision about
UPN by the close of business on Monday.  &QL;

LAKERS STUNNED BY WIZARDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON - With a few semantic twists and a Washington-style
spin job, the Lakers could say only Michael Jordan stood between
them and another historic victory.
</P>
<P>
   But even Dick Morris would have a tough time selling that pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's team ended the Lakers' 19-game winning streak Thursday
night, denying them the chance to tie the second longest streak in
NBA history. But the Bald One watched these events from the comfort
of an MCI Center luxury box, while his Washington Wizards did the
dirty work, handing the Lakers a stunning 109-102 defeat before
20,674.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Lakers' first loss since Feb. 1, a span of 44 days.
In that time, they won almost as many games as the Wizards (21-45)
have all season.
</P>
<P>
   But Washington shocked the Lakers (53-12) with an early 21-point
advantage, and even the NBA's winningest team found that deficit
too much to recover from.
</P>
<P>
   So The Streak died in the most unlikely of places, just shy of
equaling Milwaukee's 20-game streak of 1970-71.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was building, and it had taken a life of its own
there for a point,'' said Rick Fox. ``Twenty would have been a
magical number in itself, and so losing anytime is disappointing,
but to lose a streak that would have given us sole possession of
second place all-time is disappointing. It's disappointing.''
</P>
<P>
   Surprising, too. Though Jordan is now president of the Wizards,
he's had little impact in suit and tie, and in fact hadn't even
attended a game in three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But the Wizards played an inspired game, shooting 50 percent
against the NBA's top defensive team. Mitch Richmond scored 32
points, and at the other end, disrupted Kobe Bryant into a
2-for-10, 7-point effort -- easily his worst game this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did a pretty good job as far as closing down lanes, stuff
like that,'' said Bryant, who battled foul trouble as well. ``But I
was just trying to get a rhythm, trying to find my rhythm. It was
tough. Richmond did a good job. He's very deceiving. He did a good
job forcing me down the middle and closing it off, closing of
passing lanes, stuff like that. ''
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal, shaking off right-hamstring problems, started
slow but made 15 of 25 shots for a game-high 40 points and 12
rebounds. Glen Rice added 22 points on 9-of-17 shooting and nearly
saved the game with a nine-point fourth-quarter burst.
</P>
<P>
   It proved too big a task, though the Lakers briefly tied the
game at 85, on a Rice 3-pointer with 7:52 to go. More amazing, they
got there on a 15-6 run that came with O'Neal on the bench, with
five fouls.
</P>
<P>
   But Richmond answered with a pair of 3s, and the Lakers couldn't
climb back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just too far to recover for a basketball club without runing
out of gas,'' coach Phil Jackson said, ``especially when your two
top scorers get into foul trouble in the second half. We made a
game out of it, we had a chance and they came back and won it. And
more power to them.''
</P>
<P>
   The final blow came in the last minute. The Wizards held a
101-98 lead after O'Neal hit two free throws with 49.1 second left.
But when Richmond missed a jumper at the other end, Juwan Howard
pulled down the rebound to save the possession, and the Lakers were
forced to foul intentionally. Richmond hit six of six free throws
in the last 17.4 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just made a lot of silly mistakes, and we beat ourselves,''
O'Neal said. ``They got a win tonight, but they didn't really beat
us. ... (The streak) was a fun ride, we're part of history now. We
just have to start all over, get back on track.''
</P>
<P>
   With the New York Knicks and Miami Heat on the schedule in a few
days, the general consensus was this loss was preferable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably good we got this one out of our system,'' Bryant
said. ``It's better that it came against the Wizards than a team
like New York or Miami or something like that. Because you don't
want to give those guys any confidence.''

UNARMED MAN IS SHOT TO DEATH IN SCUFFLE WITH 3 UNDERCOVER

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ An unarmed Brooklyn man was shot and killed outside a
bar on Eighth Avenue in Midtown Manhattan early Thursday in a
scuffle with three undercover narcotics detectives, the authorities
said.
</P>
<P>
   The details of the shooting were sketchy Thursday night, and
there were conflicting accounts of the episode, but a senior
investigator and a man who saw the scuffle said the dead man,
Patrick M. Dorismond, 26, who worked as a security guard for the
34th Street Partnership, was angered when one of the undercover
detectives approached him and asked to buy drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The witness, Kevin Kaiser, a co-worker of Dorismond's, said he
and Dorismond had not known that the detectives _ all in plain
clothes _ who approached them were the police. Deputy Chief Thomas
Fahey, a police spokesman, acknowledged that the police ``have no
indication'' whether Dorismond knew.
</P>
<P>
   But a lawyer for the detective who fired the fatal shot, Anthony
Vasquez, 29, said his client yelled ``Police!'' after the scuffle
began and before the shot was fired.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear whether Vasquez fired intentionally or by
accident. The shooting is being investigated by the department's
Internal Affairs Bureau and by the Manhattan district attorney,
Robert Morgenthau.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting was the third in 13 months in which plainclothes
officers shot and killed an unarmed man. It came just as tensions
that rose with the acquittal of four officers in the shooting of
Amadou Diallo and another fatal shooting by police a week later had
begun to ebb.
</P>
<P>
   Like the earlier two incidents, this shooting involved a black
victim. Vasquez and his two partners are Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   Police Commissioner Howard Safir provided few details Thursday
afternoon about the shooting or the events that led up to it, and
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, speaking with reporters, urged the news
media not to judge the officers before all the evidence is
available.
</P>
<P>
   Dorismond, who has daughters ages 5 and 1, was raised in
Flatbush and had worked for the 34th Street Partnership for two
years. A security guard, he wore a police-like blue uniform bearing
the business improvement district's patch on his shoulder while on
duty.
</P>
<P>
   Although friends described him as easygoing, polite and honest,
Safir said that Dorismond had a criminal record and cited three
arrests, the most recent in 1996. In two cases, Dorismond pleaded
guilty to disorderly conduct, a low-level offense. The disposition
of the third was sealed because it occurred when he was 13.
</P>
<P>
   The confrontation began about 12:30 a.m. outside the Wakamba
Cocktail Lounge at 543 Eighth Ave., near 37th Street. Since his
shift had ended at 11 p.m., Dorismond had been drinking beer there
with Kaiser and six tourists from Chile, according to a senior
investigator and Kaiser.
</P>
<P>
   The two security guards, who had changed into street clothes
after work, were waiting for a taxi when the undercover detective
approached and asked if they knew where he could buy marijuana,
according to a senior police official, who said that the detective
thought he could buy some from Dorismond.
</P>
<P>
   Angry words were exchanged, a scuffle erupted and the two backup
detectives came to the aide of the undercover detective.
</P>
<P>
   Vasquez, who was one of the backup officers, known as ghosts in
police parlance because they shadow the undercover officer to
protect him, shot Dorismond once in the chest from close range. The
detectives, who had made eight marijuana arrests earlier in the
evening, were all assigned to the Gang Investigation Division's
narcotics unit.
</P>
<P>
   The confrontation itself was quick and chaotic, according to
investigators and police officials, and early reports of the
shooting that indicated that the officer had shot a man who had
tried to rob him were inaccurate, officials and investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   While Kaiser's account and that of the police are similar up
until the scuffle, Kaiser said the officer first took a swing at
Dorismond and the senior police official said Dorismond struck
first.
</P>
<P>
   The senior investigator said that several other people witnessed
the shooting and the events that preceded it, including an employee
inside the Wakamba. The investigator said that their accounts were
all similar to Kaiser's.
</P>
<P>
   The undercover detective and the second backup detective, whose
names were not released by the Police Department, told
investigators that they believed the scuffling was over when the
shot rang out, but they did not see the shot fired and did not know
whether Vasquez fired intentionally or accidentally.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for Vasquez, Philip Karasyk, said the officer fired his
weapon by mistake, calling the incident ``a straight accidental
shooting'' and adding of his client, ``When he pulls his own gun,
the guy lunges for it and the gun goes off.''
</P>
<P>
   But a senior police official said that either Kaiser or
Dorismond yelled, ``Get the gun!'' when they saw Vasquez's drawn
gun. The official said that statement might have led Vasquez to
wrongfully believe that either Kaiser or Dorisman had a gun. The
senior investigator said that even after the shooting, when
detectives were questioning Kaiser at the Midtown South station
house, Kaiser still thought that the three men who had confronted
him and his friend were not the police. Kaiser was held for more
than 12 hours but not charged with any crime.
</P>
<P>
   Vasquez has not been interviewed by prosecutors, nor has an
interview been requested, Karasyk said. At least four assistant
district attorneys from Morgenthau's office were interviewing other
witnesses Thursday, including the undercover detective and the
other backup officer who was involved in the scuffle, a senior law
enforcement official said.
</P>
<P>
   The detectives were in the area because the police believe it is
frequented by Bloods gang members.
</P>
<P>
   Morganthau's office will present the shooting to a grand jury, a
practice that is standard in such police shootings.

A DEPLETED KENTUCKY TEAM GETS A BIG SCARE 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By LIZ ROBBINS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ With four-tenths of a second remaining in an already
improbable game stretched into one overtime, David Messiah Capers
of St. Bonaventure created an epic from that sliver of time.
</P>
<P>
   He stood alone at the line, his team trailing by three points.
Capers, a 55.6 percent free-throw shooter, had three free throws.
His Kentucky opponents threw out insults to rattle him and coach
Tubby Smith of the Wildcats called a timeout after each of his
first two shots in an attempt to ice him. But Capers calmly swished
all three to send the first-round game into double overtime. In
turn, he sent the crowd in the Cleveland State Convocation Center
into pandemonium and Kentucky's weary players searching for oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   The fifth-seeded Wildcats, making a record 41st appearance in
the N CAA men's basketball tournament, and the 12th-seeded Bonnies,
making their first trip here in 22 years, double-dared each other
all afternoon. Yet Kentucky survived the second overtime and a near
upset when the sophomore guard Tayshaun Prince, who made a
game-tying 3-pointer with eight seconds left in regulation, closed
the exhaustive contest with two free throws for an 85-80 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did not want to get out of the tournament; we did not
want to get out of the tournament,'' said Prince, who scored a
career-high 28 points. ``We just had to dig down deep and pull out
a victory.''
</P>
<P>
   Kentucky, which began the game with nine players and started the
second overtime with six players whose legs had turned to stone
pillars, leaned on its NCAA tradition to advance to the second
round against fourth-seeded Syracuse, which scored a convincing
79-65 victory over 13th-seeded Samford.
</P>
<P>
   But the day belonged to St. Bonaventure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a heck of a way to start an NCAA tournament,'' St.
Bonaventure coach Jim Baron said. ``We fought hard, we fought long
and really persevered. We're one basket away, but Kentucky made
some big, big shots.''
</P>
<P>
   In the second overtime, Jamaal Magloire hit a turnaround jumper,
Keith Bogans made a free throw and a put-back, and Prince swished
his free throws to push Kentucky past St. Bonaventure. Meanwhile,
point guard Tim Winn and his teammates came up short on their
long-range shots and J.R. Bremer missed a pair of free throws.
</P>
<P>
   But the earlier free throws from Capers captured the frantic
call and response nature of this game. ``On the foul line, we were
talking to him, saying all kinds of stuff like: `You're going to
miss this one. You don't want to win,''' Prince recalled, shaking
his head. ``We were just saying stuff to make him miss, but he
stepped up and made them all.''
</P>
<P>
   Kentucky could have prevented overtime. Five minutes into the
second half, the Wildcats held a 13-point lead before the Bonnies
launched a 23-5 run. With 1 minute 20 seconds remaining, Winn
converted a layup on a fast break following a block by his teammate
Caswell Cyrus to give the Bonnies a 63-60 lead.
</P>
<P>
   But after a missed Bonnies shot, Kentucky got the ball back and
set a double-screen for Prince. He took advantage of his wide-open
look to drain a 3-pointer with 7.1 seconds left. It was only
Kentucky's second 3-pointer of the half.
</P>
<P>
   Winn then brought the ball downcourt and drove to the basket,
but his layup just nudged off the glass, setting up the first
overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Kentucky started to tire, especially when point guard Saul Smith
fouled out with less than 90 seconds remaining. Down the stretch,
the Wildcats converted just 5 of 10 free throws and allowed Winn to
convert a nifty reverse layup to bring the Bonnies within 74-73.
With eight seconds left, Magloire sank both free throws to give
Kentucky a 76-73 lead.
</P>
<P>
   St. Bonaventure inbounded the ball and got it to Capers on the
wing; with the clock running out, he launched a desperation
3-pointer as the Kentucky freshman Marvin Stone fouled him. Capers,
who had not been to the free-throw line in nine games, made the
first shot. Smith called a timeout and St. Bonaventure's players
linked arms in the huddle. Capers made the second shot and Smith
called another timeout. St. Bonaventure's players held one another
closer. ``We talked about family,'' Bonnies coach Jim Baron said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's crazy,'' Winn said. ``You dream about situations like
that. I had that dream, only I was the one on the line. I'm glad it
was him. I was just trying to enjoy the moment, no matter what
happens, I was going to hug him the same way.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of last season, two Kentucky players transferred,
seeking more playing time at potentially better programs. Another
player quit. Then one of Kentucky's recruits died of a heart attack
while playing in a high school game. This season, a partial
qualifier did not qualify academically, another transferred in
January, and Desmond Allison was arrested on charges of drunken
driving and possession of marijuana on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Depleted, but not defeated. ``That's been the profile of this
team,'' said Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Kentucky (23-9) now gets a rematch of the 1996 national
championship game with Syracuse. The Orangemen jumped to an early
24-13 lead. After extending a seven-point halftime lead to 10
points, Samford surged back to within four. As Syracuse center Etan
Thomas sat with three quick fouls in the second half, guard Jason
Hart made up the difference.
</P>
<P>
   He gathered a steal at half court, converted the layup and
followed with a pull-up jumper that put the Orangemen up by six,
changing the momentum of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Hart sees no advantage in meeting a very tired Kentucky squad on
Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only advantage that we had is that we got a victory after
a two-game losing streak,'' he said. ``I feel that everybody is
going to be emotionally high. When you're playing basketball, I
think your momentum carries you over the tiredness.''
</P>
<P>
   Michigan State 65, Valparaiso 38
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen minutes into its first-round game, No. 16-seeded
Valparaiso had scored just three points. Michigan State, the Big
Ten champion and a Final Four team last year, stifled the Crusaders
early with man-to-man defense and then teased them with banked-in
3-pointers and thundering alley-oop dunks. Valparaiso scored on
consecutive possessions twice all game and shot 25 percent. At
least Valparaiso beat the tournament's low scoring record by six
points.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Journalists whose work chronicled fatal medical
mistakes, pension abuse, slashed welfare rolls and death sentences
against innocent inmates were among those singled out Thursday as
recipients of the annual George Polk Awards.
</P>
<P>
   Long Island University, which administers the prize, announced
13 categories for the 1999 awards, including a career award to
Studs Terkel, 87, for his ongoing radio program and his books on
topics from the Depression to race relations.
</P>
<P>
   The National Security Archive, a private library of documents
that helps researchers in international affairs, also received a
special award for its work in obtaining documents on important
topics like Oliver North's diaries during the Iran-contra scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Among reporters, Jason DeParle of The New York Times won the
Polk Award for national reporting for his analysis of the changed
lives of welfare recipients in Wisconsin, where the rolls were
reduced 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A Polk Award for international reporting went to four
journalists at The Associated Press _ Charles J. Hanley, Martha
Mendoza, Sang-hun Choe and Randy Herschaft _ for their extensive
work unearthing a U.S. military cover-up during the Korean War.
U.S. soldiers machine-gunned hundreds of civilians under a bridge
at No Gun Ri in the war's first weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Daily News won the award for editorial writing in a
series about the grueling conditions experienced by farm laborers
cut off from the minimum wage and other benefits, and WWOR-TV in
Secaucus, N.J., better known as UPN-9 News, won the local
television reporting award for a decade of reports on racial
profiling by the police in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   The Polk Awards were established in 1949 in the memory of George
W. Polk, a CBS News correspondent murdered in Greece while covering
its civil war. The formal presentation of the awards will be on
April 18 in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Winners in seven other categories were announced.
</P>
<P>
   Criminal Justice Reporting: Ken Armstrong and Steve Mills of The
Chicago Tribune, inspired by the work of Northwestern University
journalism students, reviewed every death penalty case in Illinois
and found that 12 men had been wrongly convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Medical Reporting: Andrea Gerlin of The Philadelphia Inquirer
wrote a four-part series on the thousands of deaths every year in
U.S. hospitals due to medical mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   Financial Reporting: Ellen E. Schultz of The Wall Street Journal
exposed how large U.S. companies cut retirement benefits of
unsuspecting employees by altering their pension plans.
</P>
<P>
   Local Reporting: Kevin Carmody of The Daily Southtown in Tinley
Park, Ill., wrote about hundreds of people involved in developing
the A-bomb through the Manhattan Project who were exposed to a
toxic element and not alerted to its consequences for 45 years.
</P>
<P>
   Regional Reporting: Todd Richissin and Andre Chung, a
photographer, of The Baltimore Sun produced a series on the
brutality of Maryland's boot camps for juveniles convicted of
crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Reporting: Paul Watson of The Los Angeles Times stayed
in Kosovo throughout the nearly three-month war there. This is the
second consecutive year The Los Angeles Times has won a foreign
reporting award for its Kosovo coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Television Foreign Reporting: A team from the British
Broadcasting Corp. in London _ Olenka Frenkiel, a reporter, Giselle
Portenier, a producer and Fiona Murch, the executive producer _
made a documentary about conservative Muslim men in rural Pakistan
who maim or kill women family members suspected of infidelity. ABC
broadcast the program in the United States.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It's not your imagination. Hailing a yellow cab
really has become a lot harder.
</P>
<P>
   According to an analysis of a decade of taxi meter and odometer
readings, obtained recently from New York City by a transportation
consultant, the availability of cabs over the last seven years has
fallen sharply, by 13 percent _ even with an expansion of taxi
medallions, two fare increases and the introduction of subway and
bus fare discounts.
</P>
<P>
   The analysis confirms what anyone who relies on cabs almost
anywhere in Manhattan already knows: the city's surging economy is
increasing the demand for a taxi supply that has not increased in
several years. And the imbalance is beginning to show.
</P>
<P>
   Taxi experts add that the effect on minorities and people
seeking to travel outside Manhattan is probably much worse, because
as competition for cabs increases so do refusals _ cabdrivers
ignoring some hailing passengers or refusing to take them to
certain destinations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line here is that the anecdotal stories about how
it's much harder to catch a cab are more than borne out by the
objective data,'' said Bruce Schaller, a former policy analyst for
the city's Taxi and Limousine Commission and now a private
consultant, who obtained the cab data through Freedom of
Information laws.
</P>
<P>
   Schaller said he thought the cab shortage had become so
pronounced that the city ``really needs to start looking at how to
make cab service more readily available.''
</P>
<P>
   The analysis, conducted on data that is collected three times a
year by the taxi commission during cab inspections, found that the
number of passengers in yellow cabs, the most frequently used means
of traveling within Manhattan after the subway, had increased 17
percent over the decade. Ridership rose from 206 million a year in
1990 to 240 million last year, the 1999 figure equivalent to more
than three-quarters of the population of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers last year paid an average metered fare of $6.85, or
$8.07 with the night surcharge and a 15 percent tip. The length of
the average trip _ three miles _ was also greater than in years
past, partly because of more airport trips.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue for the taxi industry rose 46 percent in the 1990s, to
$1.39 billion in 1999 from $949 million in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   But the statistic that means the most to taxi riders is the
number of ``dead miles,'' an estimate of how much time cabbies
spent cruising for passengers and the best indicator of how readily
a cab can be hailed. As cruising miles increase, a person standing
on a street corner is more likely to encounter an available cab.
When the miles decrease, finding a cab becomes harder.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, when cab availability was at a high during the
recession, the number of cruising miles was 310 million. The figure
decreased to 271 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   The records also show that last year, 65 percent of the average
cabby's time was spent with a passenger, up from 57 percent in
1992. Because these numbers are skewed by graveyard-shift drivers,
who can cruise for long periods without a fare, the percentage of
time cabs are occupied during business hours is probably much
higher, Schaller said.
</P>
<P>
   The analysis found that a 1990 fare increase of 11.5 percent was
one of several factors that helped taxi availability rise during
the first three years of the decade. As the economy heated up, more
people were willing to pay the higher fares, and availability began
to drop rapidly, hitting a low in 1996.

EDITORIAL: AMERICA'S NATURAL ABUNDANCE
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, March 17:
</P>
<P>
   At just about every level of government, Americans are showing
great interest in conserving open space, to enhance not only their
own lives but those of the plants and animals that depend on
healthy ecosystems for survival. This interest could not be more
timely. According to a new and comprehensive survey of U.S.
biological diversity conducted by the Nature Conservancy, the
United States provides habitat for more than 200,000 native species
of plants and animals _ more than double the previous estimate.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, commercial and residential development are
placing those species under continuing pressure. For that reason,
the conservancy announced that it would earmark $1 billion over the
next five years to preserve large tracts of the American
wilderness. This is an extraordinary pledge from a private group.
But an equally important gift may be the conservancy's contribution
to the way Americans think about diversity.
</P>
<P>
   To most Americans, the word biodiversity conjures up tropical
nations and threatened rain forests in places like the Amazon. Most
of the world's plant and animal species are indeed found in the
tropics, but fully 10 percent, a much higher figure than previously
estimated, are found in the 50 states. Moreover, the United States
ranks at or near the top in its variety of mammals and freshwater
fish. It also has a wider array of distinct ecological regions _
deserts, grasslands and different kinds of forests _ than any other
nation in the world.
</P>
<P>
   The study says that new species are being discovered all the
time, and that the United States may actually contain double the
number documented so far. But as new species appear, so old ones
disappear. The study found that 500 native U.S. species had gone
extinct or are missing, and that one-third of the remainder are at
risk, 7 percent of them ``critically imperiled.''
</P>
<P>
   These figures should lend fresh urgency to the cause of
conservation. On the state and local level, voters in 1998 approved
more than $5 billion worth of initiatives aimed at conserving open
space, a record figure. But this enthusiasm has not been
reciprocated in Congress. The conservancy's $1 billion pledge, for
example, is roughly three times what Congress has appropriated for
the normal operations of the Land and Water Conservation Fund, the
main federal program for acquiring open space.
</P>
<P>
   However, there is an unusual and exciting bipartisan movement
afoot in Congress to provide a guaranteed financing stream of well
over $1 billion annually for protecting America's natural
resources. President Clinton, meanwhile, is trying to place 40
million acres of national forests permanently beyond the reach of
the timber industry and other commercial interests. As the Nature
Conservancy's report makes clear, these efforts are coming not a
moment too soon.

MAJOR OVERTURE TOWARD IRAN EXPECTED IN SPEECH BY ALBRIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Secretary of State Madeleine Albright will make a
major overture to Iran on Friday by announcing that the Clinton
administration will lift several sanctions on Tehran,
administration officials said Thursday night. She will also
acknowledge that the United States was shortsighted in its support
for Iraq during the Iran-Iraq war and in its involvement in a 1953
coup in Iran, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech here before a private group that seeks to promote
better ties with Iran, Albright will also announce that the United
States is ready to reach a quick agreement to unfreeze billions of
dollars in Iranian assets that have been held in the United States
since the 1979 Iranian revolution, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The speech, they said, was an effort by the administration to
promote ties with Iran after the victory last month in
parliamentary elections by moderate politicians loyal to Iran's
reformist president, Mohammad Khatami. Several of the details of
the speech were first published in The Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has sought to improve relations with
Iran, which were broken off as a result of the 1979 seizure of the
U.S. Embassy in Tehran, but has been rebuffed by Khatami.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials say they hope that the recent election of so many
of Khatami's allies will offer him a new power base to stand up to
his fiercely anti-U.S. foes elsewhere in the Iranian government and
to move toward closer ties with Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a substantial speech designed to strengthen the hand of
the reformers by giving them something concrete in the form of
sanctions modification,'' said a senior administration official who
has read Albright's speech. ``I don't think we expect a quick
reaction from them. I think they'll be cautious, mild, at the
beginning. But they won't be dismissive.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials confirmed several days ago that the United States
would leave oil sanctions in place on Iran but intended to lift an
embargo on Iranian caviar, rugs, pistachio nuts and other goods.
</P>
<P>
   They said Albright's speech, which she will deliver to the
American-Iranian Council, offers a vehicle to make the announcement
and to reveal other steps intended to end two decades of hostility
between the United States and Iran.
</P>
<P>
   The Iranians may be most intrigued, they said, by Albright's
disclosure that the United States is ready to move quickly to
resolve the issue of the frozen Iranian assets, which include bank
accounts and precious metals. The United States has refused to
return the assets until there is a resolution of U.S. legal claims
made against Tehran as a result of the revolution.
</P>
<P>
   The speech is expected to review decades of U.S. involvement in
Iran. Officials said Albright would express regrets over the
involvement of the Central Intelligence Agency in the 1953 coup
that restored the monarchy.
</P>
<P>
   She will also describe U.S. support for the Iraqi government of
Saddam Hussein during the Iran-Iran war of the 1980s as
shortsighted, they said.

EDITORIAL: THE ALBANIAN CHALLENGE IN KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   U.S. troops took firm action Thursday against one of the most
dangerous problems now confronting NATO in Kosovo. In a series of
raids, they seized weapons and ammunition that ethnic Albanian
guerrillas in the U.S.-patrolled eastern part of the province have
been using to launch cross-border raids into Serbia. Unless the
guerrillas are forcibly disarmed and turned away from the border,
their actions could embroil NATO in an unwanted new war with
Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic tensions have been building in Kosovo. In the city of
Kosovska Mitrovica, Serbian militants supported by Yugoslavia's
president, Slobodan Milosevic, have been blockading bridges and
streets to keep Albanians away from their homes on the north side
of the Ibar River and have been trying to partition the province
along ethnic lines. Thursday, after French and Italian
reinforcements arrived in Mitrovica, NATO troops began pushing back
against the blockades. Gen. Wesley Clark, NATO's military
commander, would like to see U.S. reinforcements sent to eastern
Kosovo as well.
</P>
<P>
   Most citizens of Kosovo would like to focus on re-establishing
personal and economic security. But those who try to cooperate with
their neighbors across ethnic lines face threats and intimidation
from extremists in both communities. Militant leaders do not really
want to see the United Nations succeed in building a civil society
in Kosovo. Neither the Albanian guerrillas of the Kosovo Liberation
Army nor the Serbian nationalists favor the compromise political
arrangement that followed last year's war. Under this formula,
Kosovo enjoys autonomy under continuing Serbian sovereignty. Both
sides must understand that they cannot impose new goals on the
international community by returning to armed conflict.
</P>
<P>
   The most acute problem these days comes from the ethnic Albanian
guerrillas. U.S. entreaties to stop the violence seem to have had
little effect. It is disheartening that the United States, which
went to war in Kosovo to protect Albanians, now must use its
military forces to confront the Kosovo Liberation Army and its
armed offshoots.
