<HEADLINE> 3 Presidents Saluted at Convention  </HEADLINE>
By JANELLE CARTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Up in front of another Republican
convention, but only on video this time, Ronald Reagan was saying
anew in Berlin, ''Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall.'' It was part
of Tuesday night's tribute to former GOP presidents Reagan, Bush
and Ford.
</P>
<P>
   Ford, Bush and their wives took the kudos in person. Former
first lady Nancy Reagan came on behalf of her husband, who is
suffering from Alzheimer's disease.
</P>
<P>
   On a night billed as full of patriotism and ''a lot of
emotion,'' the presidential video tributes affirmed Reagan's
ability to move a crowd, even in his absence, even with words that
are old.
</P>
<P>
   Tears rolled down the cheeks of Bill Campbell, 65, a former
state Senate Republican leader in California who was elected the
same year Reagan was elected governor in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was fantastic,'' Campbell said, apologizing for the catch
in his voice. ''He's a fantastic man and it's a great tragedy, the
Alzheimer's getting him.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fine memories are still there.''
</P>
<P>
   The Reagan video began with the 1981 assassination attempt and a
narrator intoning ''We almost lost him.'' It continued with clips
of Reagan speaking after the explosion of the space shuttle
Challenger and the famed quote at the Berlin Wall.
</P>
<P>
   Lusty cheers rose from the crowd. Indeed, they cheered and
applauded repeatedly during the six-minute Reagan video.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Reagan, in a pale green dress and large pearls, stood to
acknowledge the ovation.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's video began with a narration of America's war with Iraq
and included the former president talking about his son, Gov.
George W. Bush, who will accept the party's presidential nomination
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think George's record can stand all the scrutiny in the
world. I think it will show a man of honor, a man of integrity,''
the former president says in the tape.
</P>
<P>
   As the band played ''Devil with a Blue Dress,'' Barbara Bush
took the stage with a very blue dress indeed, with polka dots, and
introduced her son, appearing by satellite from nearby Gettysburg,
Pa.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope I am the first person to welcome you to Philadelphia,
the city of motherly love,'' she said, a twist on the ''brotherly''
love for which the city likes to be known.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush tribute ended with the father reading an August 1998
letter written to sons George W. and Jeb, the governors of Texas
and Florida. In the letter he talks about how instances may arise
where the sons may have to disagree with some of his policies.
</P>
<P>
   ''Don't worry about it,'' the former president says in the
letter. ''Nothing can ever be written that will drive a wedge
between us, nothing at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford was praised as the president who ''put America back
together in his quiet, steady way'' after Watergate. The video also
told of the Ford family's personal struggles and included clips
from Betty Ford's surgery for breast cancer. It ended with Ford
talking about what George W. Bush can do for America.
</P>
<P>
   Seized with emotion, Ford's eyes welled with tears during his
tribute.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Ford, told C-SPAN that this would be his and his wife
Betty's last political convention and described it as a
''concluding appearance to indicate our support.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We are going to be there because we feel so strongly about the
Republican philosophy, the record of the Republican party over the
years, and our two candidates George W. and Dick Cheney,'' said
Ford, who is 87.
</P>
<P>
   Ford, in an interview with CNN's Larry King, said Bush was
''running this campaign better than the one run by his father a
couple of years ago. George has learned from the mistakes that were
made in the last Bush campaign and so far I think they're producing
good results.''
</P>
<P>
   Reagan is 89, former President Bush, 76.

<HEADLINE> WHO To Release Tobacco Ind. Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The World Health Organization is accusing the
tobacco industry of secretly trying to undermine its campaign to
reduce smoking around the world, according to The Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
   A WHO report to be released Wednesday details a sophisticated
effort to pit other U.N.-affiliated agencies against WHO
initiatives, as well as using statements from scientists who have
financial ties to the tobacco industry, the Post reported on its
Web site Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper said former Food and Drug Administration
Commissioner David Kessler was one of the report's authors and much
of the information is culled from tobacco company documents that
came to light through court proceedings against the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ''The tobacco companies' own documents show that they viewed
WHO, an international public health agency, as one of the foremost
enemies,'' the Post quoted the report as saying. ''The documents
show further that the tobacco companies instigated global
strategies to discredit and impede WHO's ability to carry out its
mission.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the Post, the report explains the ways the industry
created and used ''ostensibly independent quasi-academic, public
policy and business organizations.''
</P>
<P>
   David Davies, a vice president with Philip Morris International,
did not deny to the Post that the industry used these tactics, but
said that it no longer used them.
</P>
<P>
   The company documents are ''the product of a polarized and
unproductive environment in which few solutions were sought, and
conflict prevailed over consensus,'' Davies told the Post. ''Phlip
Morris regrets this.''
</P>
<P>
   The report highlights a 1988 meeting in Boca Raton, Fla., where
tobacco executives allegedly planned their attack.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called Boca Raton plan, the report says, ''is a master
plan for, among many goals, attacking WHO's tobacco control
programs, influencing the priorities of WHO Regional Offices, and
targeting the structure, management and resources of the WHO.'' The
plan ''identified 26 global threats to the tobacco industry and
multiple strategies for countering each,'' the report says.

<HEADLINE> TV Pundits Left Hanging in Philly  </HEADLINE>
By FRAZIER MOORE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Wipe that smile off your face!
</P>
<P>
   This remained the hope and even advice of many TV pundits
Tuesday, as the sweetness-and-light of the Republican National
Convention shined on.
</P>
<P>
   CNN political analyst William Schneider spoke for many restless
commentators, watching the GOP gathering in Philadelphia, when he
said, ''How long can this convention go on with its happy face?
Sooner or later, the delegates are going to want some red meat.
Where's the beef?''
</P>
<P>
   At his side, analyst Jeff Greenfield chimed in, ''Forget the
media's indignation over image-making.'' The real problem, he
posed, may be that making ''audiences feel warm and gooey isn't
smart politics.''
</P>
<P>
   It seemed the Republicans weren't listening as they propelled
George W. Bush toward his nomination Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Even reporters' attempts to escalate the feud between former
President Bush and President Clinton went nowhere. Bush declined to
enlarge on his outburst on NBC Monday night that if Clinton didn't
stop attacking his son, he would say what he felt about Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been very good about not criticizing the president for
eight years,'' Bush said Tuesday, refusing to be goaded into
breaking his silence.
</P>
<P>
   Clutching at straws? Fox News Channel panelists couldn't help
chuckling at news that members of the Texas delegation planned to
bow their heads in silent protest during the speech of Arizona
congressman Jim Kolbe, the only openly gay GOP member of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ''That is probably the most controversial thing that will happen
all week,'' said correspondent Mara Liasson, smiling. ''As a
journalist, I am grateful.''
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday's made-for-TV program had its moments:
</P>
<P>
   -- Ret. Army Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf addressing the convention by
satellite from the deck of the USS New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   -- Nancy Reagan stoically watching the video tribute to her
husband, former President Reagan, now stricken with Alzheimer's
disease.
</P>
<P>
   -- Soon-to-be candidate Bush making another ''reminder''
appearance by satellite, this time from Gettysburg, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   For a second day, broadcast's PBS and cable's CNN, Fox News
Channel, MSNBC and C-SPAN stayed with the Philadelphia story.
Broadcast networks ABC, CBS and NBC joined the action only at 10
p.m. EDT -- for the latter two networks, within their newsmagazines.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps NBC's decision to skip the convention altogether Monday
night was justified. Its rerun of the drama ''Third Watch'' drew 10
million viewers, while the CBS newsmagazine ''48 Hours,'' which
devoted roughly half the broadcast to the Republicans, attracted
6.4 million viewers. ABC, which stayed with the convention for the
full hour, was watched by 5.9 million viewers.
</P>
<P>
   National ratings for the cable networks put CNN predictably in
first place, with 1.2 million viewers between 8 and 11 p.m. EDT.
During the same period, Fox News Channel averaged 676,000 viewers.
MSNBC brought up the rear with 516,000 viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Why, in a three-way face-off, would MSNBC come in third? After
all, its coverage was staffed by NBC News' first string (including
Tom Brokaw and Tim Russert) and heavily promoted on its broadcast
sister, NBC.
</P>
<P>
   In response to the question, MSNBC spokesman Mark O'Connor said,
''We are very happy with this number.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is double what we normally do on an average week in July,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   But maybe MSNBC would have fared better without its
heat-and-no-light analysts James Carville and Bill Bennett.
Democratic strategist Carville, as usual, was a hopped-up
rattletrap while conservative activist Bennett mostly sat by
looking dyspeptic.
</P>
<P>
   Their segments alone were good reason to switch channels.

<HEADLINE> Former penny stock mogul Brennan arrested on bankruptcy fraud charges </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY GOLD
<TEXT>
<P>
   FREEHOLD, N.J. (AP) - For disgraced financier Robert E. Brennan,
the knock on the door came while he was showering, his lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Federal and state agents arrived with warrants about 6:30 a.m.
Tuesday at his apartment on the Colts Neck property where he once
had his archly named Due Process Stables.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in two decades of continuing clashes with
stock regulators, Brennan faced criminal charges and was placed in
handcuffs.
</P>
<P>
   Two indictments unsealed with his arrest charge that Brennan
attempted to hide from creditors over $500,000 he got from cashing
casino chips less than a month after he filed for bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the one-time penny stock mogul made two court
appearances dressed in a blue Oxford shirt and blue jeans - and
wrist shackles - instead of the dark suits he favors for courthouse
garb.
</P>
<P>
   Brennan, 56, became publicly known in the 1980s through his
television commercials for his former flagship brokerage, First
Jersey Securities Inc., stepping off a helicopter and urging
viewers to ''come grow with us.''
</P>
<P>
   After sitting through a state court bail hearing in Freehold in
the morning, silent except to answer a few routine questions,
Brennan spoke at length during his bail hearing in Newark on the
federal charges.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to defend this case,'' Brennan told U.S.
Magistrate Stanley R. Chesler. ''I don't intend to go anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Chesler found that Brennan posed ''some risk of
flight'' and ordered him to remain under house arrest in Colts Neck
until he could post $500,000 cash or secured bail. He allowed
Brennan to travel to Florida and New York, but not by private
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Brennan had posted $250,000 cash bail set by state
Superior Court Judge Theodore J. Labrecque Jr., but was kept in
federal custody and taken to the hearing before Chesler.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyer Michael Critchley said Brennan's friends were
helping him, but declined to say who posted his bail.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy State Attorney General Thomas R. Clark had argued in the
state proceeding that Brennan posed a flight risk and sought $1
million bail. He noted that Brennan has regularly flown overseas on
private aircraft and still has access to $6 million in an overseas
trust fund that he has not surrendered.
</P>
<P>
   Similar arguments were made at the federal hearing by Assistant
U.S. Attorney Henry E. Klingeman, who sought $1 million bail and
house arrest in the Colts Neck apartment, in a gated community at
the Due Process golf course, now to be auctioned to satisfy
creditors.
</P>
<P>
   Brennan rose and broke his silence, asserting he has no control
over the trust and is not a beneficiary.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was created when I was enormously solvent for the benefit
of others,'' said Brennan, a native New Jerseyan who said his
official residence is in Juno Beach, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   The five-count state indictment charged that Brennan failed to
declare money from the casino chips and a $5,900 wagering account
he maintained with the New York Racing Association.
</P>
<P>
   The six-count federal indictment accused him of making false
statements in his bankruptcy case regarding the chips.
</P>
<P>
   He is to enter a plea on the federal charges Thursday, and to
the state charges on Sept. 11. His lawyer, Michael Critchley, said
he would plead innocent.
</P>
<P>
   Brennan has been barred from the securities industry for years,
but now faces the possibility of prison for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   The state indictment includes second-degree charges that carry a
penalty of up to 10 years in prison. Each of the six federal
charges carries a penalty of up to five years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   However, Critchley estimated that the likely state term, if
convicted, would be about seven years, making Brennan eligible for
parole in 14 months. Klingeman said the likely federal term would
be 27-30 months, with no parole.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors did not indicate which case would be tried first,
but Critchley said that since the cases stem from the same facts,
double jeopardy protection barred more than one trial.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of the chips was raised earlier this year by state
prosecutors in a civil proceeding. Brennan responded then that the
matter had been ''examined in minutia'' four years ago and was only
raised ''to smear and embarrass me.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, authorities revealed more about the transaction,
charging that Brennan cashed $504,794 in chips at 2:40 a.m. Sept.
4, 1995, less than a month after declaring bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   ''He then walked off with a duffel bag full of cash,'' First
Assistant Attorney General Paul Zoubek said at a Trenton news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   Outside federal court, Critchley did not dispute that the
transaction occurred.
</P>
<P>
   ''All I'm saying was that those chips were not assembled on
prior trips,'' as prosecutors charge, Critchley said.
</P>
<P>
   The state raised the issue of whether Brennan was improperly
shielding assets to keep them from being used to satisfy the $45
million he agreed to pay to aggrieved investors.
</P>
<P>
   Brennan has paid very little of the $45 million, which was set
in a June 1999 deal with New Jersey regulators to settle their
stock fraud lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Brennan denied wrongdoing, but consented to a finding that he
used ''substantial influence'' at two brokerages to make
''unreasonably excessive profits'' in stocks in which he held an
undisclosed interest from 1988-95.
</P>
<P>
   The state had charged that after closing First Jersey in the
late 1980s, Brennan secretly controlled two other brokerages to
push low-cost, high-risk stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The federal Securities and Exchange Commission maintains that
First Jersey engaged in similar behavior by subjecting potential
investors to high-pressure sales tactics.
</P>
<P>
   Brennan avoided serious sanctions until 1995, when a federal
judge in Manhattan ruled that Brennan had cheated investors and
ordered him to pay what is now more than $78 million for the agency
to give back to investors.
</P>
<P>
   Brennan filed for bankruptcy protection in Trenton federal court
on Aug. 7, 1995, just before the money was due.
</P>
<P>
   He has suffered a series of legal setbacks since then, but court
records indicate he managed to maintain a lavish lifestyle. He flew
around the world and dined graciously as part of his job to attract
members to the golf club.
</P>
<P>
   However, he did have to relinquish his control of two race
tracks and leave the governing board of his alma mater, Seton Hall
University, on which he served as chairman.

<HEADLINE> White Sox 4, Rangers 3  </HEADLINE>
By MATT CURRY
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Charles Johnson made quite a first
impression on his new teammates.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson hit a tiebreaking solo homer in the ninth inning of his
first game with the White Sox, propelling Chicago to a 4-3 victory
over the Texas Rangers on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, acquired Saturday along with Harold Baines from
Baltimore, hit a 400-foot blast to left off John Wetteland (4-4)
with one out in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers considered trading Wetteland before Monday's
deadline, but chose to hold onto their closer instead.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Howry (2-2), who allowed a game-tying, two-run single to
Gabe Kapler in the eighth, pitched 1 1-3 innings for the win.
</P>
<P>
   Kapler extended his hitting streak to 15 games with the tying
hit. Rafael Palmeiro was thrown out at third base on the play to
end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago had gone ahead in the top half with two runs. Magglio
Ordonez hit a two-out RBI double to break a 1-1 tie, and Baines --
in his third stint with the White Sox -- followed with an RBI
single.
</P>
<P>
   James Baldwin allowed three runs and six hits in 7 1-3 innings
for his third straight no-decision for Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Glynn threw seven strong innings for the Rangers, but left
with a no-decision for the fourth time in his last six starts.
Glynn allowed just one run and six hits.
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox took the lead in the third after Chris Singleton
led off with a double and eventually scored on Jose Valentin's
single.
</P>
<P>
   Texas tied it in the fifth when Bill Haselman doubled and scored
on Mike Lamb's single.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The teams hit into two double plays apiece in the first
four innings. ... Chicago is on a stretch in which it plays 26 of
39 games against AL West opponents. ... Being down only 1-0 after
three innings Tuesday was a welcome change for Texas. The Rangers
fell behind by at least 3-0 in all four games of their prior series
with the Detroit Tigers, including 6-0 in the first inning of the
last two games.

<HEADLINE> Ravens, Taylor Agree On Contract  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GINSBURG
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) -- Wide receiver Travis Taylor, the 10th pick in
the NFL draft, agreed in principle to a five-year, $10.9 million
contract with the Baltimore Ravens on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, the second of the Ravens' two first-round picks, is
expected to report to training camp Thursday morning. His holdout
began last Monday.
</P>
<P>
   A standout at the University of Florida, Taylor will sign a
contract that includes a guaranteed $5 million signing bonus.
According to Taylor's agent, Steve Weinberg, the bonus is 33
percent higher than that received by Baltimore cornerback Chris
McAlister, last year's No. 10 overall pick.
</P>
<P>
   ''Travis is very happy to put this behind him,'' Weinberg said
in a telephone interview. ''This is a huge deal for Travis. He can
provide for his family for a lifetime.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal came after an intense round of negotiations that began
Sunday night. According to a source familiar with the talks, the
contract will pay Taylor $1 million more than the Ravens offered a
week ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Ravens insisted that their initial offer was slotted between
the ninth and 11th picks, but Weinberg said otherwise. After
further negotiations, an agreement was finally reached.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously we're pleased and relieved to have it done,'' coach
Brian Billick said.
</P>
<P>
   Billick said Taylor would not play in the Ravens' first
preseason game Saturday against the Philadelphia Eagles at PSINet
Stadium. He also wasn't sure if Taylor would play the following
preseason game, Aug. 12, against the New York Jets at PSINet
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Billick said Taylor would probably be held out of both games not
as a punishment, but as a precaution.
</P>
<P>
   ''You need two weeks to prepare a team, individually and
collectively, to play a preseason game in order for them to stay
healthy and be able to handle themselves properly so that you can
get anything out of it,'' Billick said.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, who caught 34 passes for 463 yards and six touchdowns at
Florida last season before declaring for the draft as a junior, was
projected to be the Ravens' third receiver. But Billick said that
scenario would be ''very ambitious'' for the early part of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   The Ravens are thin at receiver due to injuries to starter
Patrick Johnson (broken right clavicle) and reserve Kendrick Nord
(broken right fibula).

<HEADLINE> Dodgers, Pirates Split Doubleheader  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN ROBINSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Alex Cora hit a go-ahead two-run triple in Los
Angeles' three-run eighth inning and the Dodgers avoided losing a
doubleheader to Pittsburgh rookie pitchers, beating the Pirates 5-3
in the second game Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Adrian Beltre homered and drove in three runs as the Dodgers
stopped a three-game losing streak against sub-.500 teams. They
dropped the final two games of a three-game weekend series in
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Left-hander Jimmy Anderson, dominating since returning from the
minors, pitched five-hit ball over eight shutout innings as the
Pirates won the opener 6-0.
</P>
<P>
   Pirates rookie Bronson Arroyo left leading 3-2 after six innings
of the second game, but his bullpen couldn't hold the lead.
</P>
<P>
   After Josias Manzanillo struck out Gary Sheffield looking with
the bases loaded in the eighth, Marc Wilkins (2-2) came in to walk
Shawn Green ahead of Todd Hundley's single in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Pirates closer Mike Williams, who rarely pitches before the
ninth inning, then gave up Beltre's tying RBI double before Cora
tripled to right field.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Herges (8-0), who said after the first game that the
Pirates were the kind of team the Dodgers have to ''beat up on,''
pitched a scoreless seventh inning for his eighth consecutive
victory.
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates led 2-0 on John Vander Wal's two-run homer off
Ismael Valdes in the first inning and Enrique Wilson's solo shot
off Antonio Osuna in the fifth. Wilson played his first game since
being traded by Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Valdes, traded back to the Dodgers by the Cubs in a trading
deadline deal, struck out eight in a four-inning outing abbreviated
because he warmed up and pitched to three batters before Monday's
game was rained out.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Adams pitched a scorelesss eighth before Jeff Shaw
finished up for his 17th save in 24 opportunities. He has pitched 8
2-3 scoreless innings in his last nine appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Ramirez, also included in the Cordero deal, hit a two-run
double in the first game as Anderson (4-5), who won once in 11
starts in the first three months of the season, improved to 2-0 in
four starts since a short stay in the minors. He has allowed three
earned runs in 30 2-3 innings in the four starts.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson has not allowed an earned run in three of the four
starts, two against Los Angeles, and has an 0.88 ERA since
returning from Triple-A Nashville on July 16.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez's double came in a three-run fourth inning aided by two
wild pitches by Carlos Perez (4-6).
</P>
<P>
   Perez, winless in 13 starts, was roughed up for the second
successive start, giving up five runs and nine hits in four innings
as the Pirates took a 5-0 lead after four. The left-hander lasted
three-plus innings in his previous start, giving up eight earned
runs in an 11-4 loss to Colorado on July 26.
</P>

   PHOENIX (AP) -- Jennifer Gillom scored 28 points on 10-of-12
shooting and grabbed six rebounds to lead the Phoenix Mercury to an
84-77 victory over the Orlando Miracle on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Mercury set a franchise record for field goal percentage,
going 29-of-51 (56.9 percent). The previous record was 55 percent
in an 80-62 victory at Houston on June 3.
</P>
<P>
   Tonya Edwards scored 12 points and Brandy Reed added 11 for
Phoenix (18-10), which has won four of its last five games.
</P>
<P>
   Adrienne Johnson led Orlando with 24 points and Shannon Johnson
added 15.
</P>
<P>
   The loss was the sixth straight for the Miracle (14-14) and
eighth in their last nine games. It is the first time since June 22
that Orlando has been at the .500 mark.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando cut a 10-point deficit to 66-64 with 4:10 left. Gillom
then made a basket and a 3-pointer as the Mercury went on a 7-0 run
and pulled away.
</P>
<P>
   The Mercury also set a team record for field goal percentage in
a first half, going 17-of-25 (68 percent) in taking a 41-34 lead.
The old record of 63.3 percent was also set June 3.

<HEADLINE> Giants 13, Brewers 8  </HEADLINE>
By GREG BEACHAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Bobby Estalella's bases-loaded walk in the
eighth inning scored the go-ahead run as the San Francisco Giants
stayed in first place with a 13-8 victory over the Milwaukee
Brewers on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Estalella drew a five-pitch walk from Ray King (0-1) that scored
J.T. Snow, who had four hits and doubled to start the Giants'
five-run eighth. The rally was extended by two Milwaukee errors
which led to three unearned runs.
</P>
<P>
   After Estalella's walk, San Francisco added two more runs on
Calvin Murray's infield single and Ron Belliard's poor throw to
first. One pitch later, Jose Hernandez dropped Bill Mueller's fly
ball in left field to bring in two more.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Bonds and Jeff Kent homered for the Giants, who shook
their offensive slump by pounding out 17 hits. San Francisco hit
just .180 in the first 10 games of its 12-game road trip, but the
Giants had few problems against Milwaukee starter John Snyder and
the Brewers' bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Henry (2-3), acquired Sunday in a trade from Houston,
pitched one inning for the win.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants, who moved one percentage point in front of Arizona
into first place in the NL West on Monday, won their second
straight and improved to 6-5 on the road trip, their longest of the
season. San Francisco got at least one RBI from every spot in the
lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Richie Sexson, who hit a three-run homer in the first inning,
tied it at 7 with a sacrifice fly in the seventh. He added an RBI
single in the ninth, tying his career high in RBIs. The homer and
RBIs were Sexson's first since being traded from Cleveland to
Milwaukee on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Bonds' solo homer in the first inning -- a 405-footer to
dead-center -- was his 33rd of the year, putting him one behind Gary
Sheffield for the NL lead. Bonds had just four hits in his previous
31 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee shook up its lineup, benching slumping center fielder
Marquis Grissom and bumping Jeromy Burnitz down to sixth in the
order. James Mouton went 2-for-4 in the leadoff spot, while Burnitz
went 1-for-3.
</P>
<P>
Notes: A sprinting Kent got his glove on Mouton's foul pop in the
second inning in foul territory. The ball then bounced out of his
glove, but Kent caught it with his bare hand. ... Geoff Jenkins
left the game in the fifth inning with what the team called
''allergic symptoms.'' The Milwaukee left fielder was spotted
sneezing uncontrollably -- and humorously, at least to his teammates
-- in the Brewers' clubhouse before the game. Jenkins singled and
struck out before leaving. ... Right-hander Kyle Peterson, a member
of the Brewers' rotation for three months last season, allowed an
unearned run in 3 2-3 innings of a rehabilitation start at Class-A
Beloit. It was Peterson's first action since undergoing
arthroscopic shoulder surgery in February. The Brewers don't expect
him back for at least a month.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Scott Elarton came within two outs of his first
career shutout and the Houston Astros held on to beat the Florida
Marlins 4-3 Tuesday night despite losing Craig Biggio for the
season.
</P>
<P>
   Elarton (11-4) allowed three runs, five hits, struck out seven
and walked two in 8 1-3 innings to win his seventh game in eight
starts, and his eighth since June 5.
</P>
<P>
   Biggio tore the anterior cruciate and medial collateral
ligaments in his left knee during a collision with Florida's
Preston Wilson in the seventh inning.
</P>
<P>
   With Wilson on first base, Mike Lowell hit a grounder to third.
On Chris Truby's throw to second base, Wilson slid into Biggio, who
was covering the base and landed hard.
</P>
<P>
   Biggio will return to Houston for an MRI on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Florida's Chuck Smith (1-4) took a no-hitter into the sixth
inning before giving up four unearned runs, including a two-run
single by Moises Alou.
</P>
<P>
   After Mark Smith walked and Wilson singled in the ninth, Derrek
Lee hit a two-run triple off Elarton with one out to make it 4-2.
Dave Berg drove in another run with a sacrifice fly off Octavio
Dotel, who got two outs for his fourth save in as many
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who earned his first major league victory in his last
start against Greg Maddux and the Atlanta Braves, allowed two hits
and struck out seven in seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   Smith started the sixth by striking out Truby before Raul Chavez
broke up the no-hitter by lining a single to right. Smith struck
out Elarton for the second out.
</P>
<P>
   Julio Lugo then walked and Biggio extended the inning by hitting
a chopper in front of the plate that drew a wild throw from catcher
Ramon Castro that hit Biggio in the back.
</P>
<P>
   With the bases loaded, Smith walked Jeff Bagwell and Lance
Berkman to make it 2-0. Alou's single drove in Biggio and Bagwell
to give the Astros a 4-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Smith was going for his second win in as many starts after going
winless in his first seven outings.
</P>
<P>
   Smith retired the first nine batters, three by strikeout, and 13
of the first 14. He allowed a one-out walk to Alou in the fifth,
but got out of the inning when Richard Hidalgo hit into a double
play.
</P>
<P>
   Elarton breezed through the first six innings by not allowing a
runner to reach second.
</P>
<P>
   Elarton allowed an infield single to Mark Smith in the first, a
single to Berg in the fifth and a single to Wilson in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   The Marlins put up a mild threat in the seventh, with Mike
Lowell reaching on a fielder's choice following Wilson's single,
and Berg's walk. But Castro flied to center to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Astros will start Brian Powell on Thursday against the
Marlins in place of Shane Reynolds, who is recovering from
tightness in his lower back. Powell will be called up from
Triple-A. ... The Astros, the NL Central winners last year, didn't
win three in a row this year until their 98th game. ... After their
current road trip, the Astros will return home and play 16 of 19
games at Enron Field. ... The Marlins have had four rain delays
this year, plus one rainout. Last year, the team had eight rain
delays and two rainouts by Aug. 1. ... Newly-acquired OF Henry
Rodriguez is expected to join the team before Wednesday's game.

<HEADLINE> McCain Salutes Bush at Convention  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID ESPO
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- On an evening honoring sacrifice and
service, John McCain smartly saluted George W. Bush on Tuesday at
the Republican National Convention, beckoning independents and
Democrats to support the Texas governor as a man of ''courage and
character.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I support him. I am grateful to him. And I am proud of him,''
said McCain, deferring to his one-time rival from the very podium
where Bush will accept the presidential nomination on Thursday
night.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you believe that patriotism is more than a soundbite and
public service should be more than a photo-op, then vote for
Governor Bush,'' said McCain, who spent more than five years in a
North Vietnamese prison camp. The Arizonan won seven primaries last
winter on a message of political reform, and showed strong appeal
among independent voters who could be pivotal in the campaign for
the White House this fall.
</P>
<P>
   That made him a strategic choice as closing speaker of the
second night of the convention -- a program designed to broaden
Bush's political appeal as well as stress his support for a
muscular military and to stir memories of Republican presidents of
the recent past.
</P>
<P>
   For the second straight night, Bush addressed the delegates from
the campaign trail. They cheered when his image appeared on huge
screens scattered throughout the hall, and again when he pledged to
''rebuild our military and strengthen our alliances.''
</P>
<P>
   But they sent up the loudest cheers of the convention thus far
for a video tribute to Ronald Reagan, the conservative icon who
twice led the party to victory and is suffering from Alzheimer's
Disease at 89.
</P>
<P>
   The pace of the campaign quickened on Day 2 of the Bush-Cheney
convention. So, too, the pace outside. Four miles from the
convention hall, police arrested at least 280 protesters in the
first serious demonstrations of the convention week.
</P>
<P>
   Police Commissioner John Timoney said his bicycle was used as a
weapon against him, adding, ''I've got a few bumps and bruises but
I'm OK.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We have taken the streets,'' said Sue Kelly, 54, of Richmond,
Va., protesting the death penalty. ''We just don't like Republicans
and what the ruling class stands for.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush spoke from Gettysburg, Pa., near the famous Civil War
battlefield, where he returned McCain's compliments, saying his
'straight talk and strong convictions are admired across America.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also introduced Condoleezza Rice, his national security
adviser who served his father in the White House. ''It all begins
with integrity in the Oval Office,'' said Rice. ''George W. Bush is
a man of his word. Friend and foe will know that he tells the
truth.''
</P>
<P>
   A black woman, Ms. Rice was a bridge between Monday night's
convention program that stressed diversity, and the Tuesday script
that underscored the need for a strong defense.
</P>
<P>
   Retired Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf also was on the program, giving
a stern partisan speech from the USS New Jersey, docked in Camden,
N.J., where it will become a floating museum.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Dole, the party's 1996 nominee, stirred the GOP delegates
with a tribute to fellow World War II veterans as ordinary
Americans who became heroes of liberty. He asked all veterans in
the convention hall to stand to the cadence of their military
anthems.
</P>
<P>
   There were video tributes to the three living former Republican
presidents: Gerald R. Ford; Reagan and George Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Ford and Bush had VIP seats in the hall and in a poignant
appearance, Nancy Reagan left her husband's side to represent him
among the former presidents.
</P>
<P>
   George Bush, the nation's 41st president, delivered a father's
proud endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think George's record can stand all the scrutiny in the
world,'' the former president said of his son in one video. ''I
think it will show a man of honor, a man of integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's running mate, Dick Cheney, visited the convention hall
during the day to check the podium where he will deliver his
acceptance speech Wednesday evening. So, too McCain, accompanied by
his wife Cindy, who recorded the scene on a hand-held videocamera.
</P>
<P>
   Dwight Stowell Jr., doctor from Royalston, Mass., voted for
McCain in the nominating roll call, to send a message on campaign
finance reform. ''I hope my little thing sends a message to
Governor Bush that he should be talking about this. We want him to
be elected but we want him to be elected talking about campaign
finance reform.''
</P>
<P>
   In a pre-speech interview with reporters, McCain said he was
dismayed by all the perks that wealthy donors are heaping on
delegates and GOP officeholders in connection with the convention.
</P>
<P>
   ''The system's broken; we are addicted to soft money,'' McCain
said. He quickly noted that the problem is not just Republican.
''The fact is it's a bipartisan issue,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He made no overt mention of his signature campaign issue in his
prepared speech.
</P>
<P>
   He touched on themes he raised in his campaign last winter, then
said the same concerns drew him to Bush's side.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you believe America deserves leaders with a purpose more
than expediency and opportunity, then vote for Governor Bush,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is easy to forget in politics where principle ends and
selfishness begins. It takes leaders of courage and character to
remember the difference,'' he said. ''Tomorrow, our party will
nominate such a leader.'''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ''I say to all Americans, Republican, Democrat or
independent, if you believe America deserves leaders with a purpose
more ennobling than expediency and opportunism, then vote for Gov.
Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, the son and grandson of admirals and a prisoner of war
in Vietnam, noted that many years ago Bush's father had served
under McCain's grandfather in World War II. ''Now it is my turn to
serve under the son of my grandfather's brave subordinate,'' he
said. ''I am proud to do so for I know that by supporting George W.
Bush I serve my country well.''
</P>
<P>
   John Pappageorge, an alternate from Michigan, set the political
context for the appearance by McCain, who attracted votes from
independents and some Democrats in his bid for the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we have to do is find out who all those people were who
crossed over and get them to cross over again,'' said Pappageorge,
who said he voted for the Arizona senator in last winter's primary.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday evening's program was a more conventional one for
Republicans, who scripted an opening night show on Monday that was
devoted to diversity and the desirability of racial inclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats dispatched two black members of the House -- Reps.
Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas and Harold Ford of Tennessee -- to
ridicule GOP claims on those issues.
</P>
<P>
   They said GOP rhetoric is not matched by the party's record on
issues ranging from civil rights to display of the Confederate
flag. ''You can't overlook their record,'' Ford said.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters, Bush said, ''I agree with Colin Powell
that Republicans need to do more to reach out to minorities. And I
agree with him that I'm the man to do it for the Republican
Party.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has generally refrained from mentioning either President
Clinton or Vice President Al Gore by name, but he did so twice
during the day. Once came at a rally in Charleston, W.Va., the
other aboard his campaign plane.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's father stepped in, as well, irritated because Clinton
suggested the governor was in the running because his ''daddy was
president.''
</P>
<P>
   If the criticism persists, the former president said, he'll tell
Americans what he really thinks about Clinton ''as a human being
and as a person.''

   PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Sophia Witherspoon scored 24 points and
Tully Bevilaqua hit a go-ahead pair of free throws in the final
minute, lifting the Portland Fire to a 54-50 win over the expansion
Miami Sol on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Bevilaqua was fouled by Michelle Black on a fast break with 43
seconds left and hit both shots to give Portland a 51-50 lead.
Miami did not score on its next three possessions.
</P>
<P>
   Sheri Sam scored 23 to lead the Sol, who outrebounded the Fire
34-17 led by Marlies Askamp's 10, but shot just 33 percent from the
field.
</P>
<P>
   Miami (10-18) went on a 10-5 run to start the second half,
taking a 39-31 lead as the Fire went 4:37 without scoring.
</P>
<P>
   The Fire (10-18) cut into the lead as Witherspoon hit a pair of
3-pointers to bring Portland within 42-39. Sylvia Crawley then
banked a layup in with 7:18 left, and Witherspoon's pair of free
throws a minute later gave Portland its first lead since the first
minute of the half.
</P>
<P>
   Sam countered with a short jumper to beat the shot clock, and
Black rebounded Sam's miss and hit a layup with 4:10 left to give
Miami a 46-44 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Crawley then hit one of two free throws and DeMya Walker added a
pair to give Portland a 49-48 lead.

   After Black hit a pair from the free-throw line with 1:19 left,
Michelle Marciniak forced a Miami turnover, setting up Bevilaqua's

<HEADLINE> Orioles 10, Twins 0  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GINSBURG
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) -- Mike Mussina held the Minnesota Twins hitless
through six innings and settled for his third career one-hitter,
striking out a club-record 15, as the Baltimore Orioles cruised to
a 10-0 victory Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Coomer ended Mussina's no-hit bid with a solid
opposite-field single with two outs in the seventh. Mussina walked
two batters, and two Twins reached on errors in the ninth inning.
</P>
<P>
   It was a rare gem in an otherwise unpleasant season for Mussina
(7-10), whose lackluster record can be attributed heavily to a lack
of run support. He came in receiving just 3.29 runs per nine
innings, lowest in the AL.
</P>
<P>
   On this night, Mussina got plenty of offensive backing while
lowering his ERA to 3.65. Baltimore built a 7-0 lead after five
innings, the only suspense was whether Mussina would complete the
first no-hitter in the majors this season.
</P>
<P>
   Mussina had 10 strikeouts through five innings and fanned six
straight at one point. He also struck out 15 in the 1997 playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Albert Belle hit a three-run homer and a two-run double, and
Brook Fordyce, playing in his third game with the Orioles after
being obtained in a trade with the White Sox, hit two solo homers.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first two-homer game of Fordyce's career.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore, which unloaded six veterans in a trading spree that
ended Monday, has won four straight. Newcomer Melvin Mora went
3-for-4 with a walk.
</P>
<P>
   Twins rookie Mark Redman, who had won four straight starts,
allowed seven runs and seven hits in four-plus innings. Redman
(9-5) gave up a career-high three homers, and the seven runs
equaled the amount he yielded during his four-game winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles went up 1-0 in the first without a hit when Redman
walked three batters before Chris Casimiro, playing in his second
game in the majors, hit a run-scoring grounder.
</P>
<P>
   Fordyce hit a 1-2 pitch over the wall in center leading off the
second, then connected with one out in the fourth to make it 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   Delino DeShields singled in a run in the fifth before Belle hit
a towering fly that hit the foul pole. It was his 20th homer, the
second in two nights after a career-high string of 27 games without
a home run.
</P>
<P>
   A throwing error by Twins shortstop Denny Hocking produced an
unearned run in the eighth before Belle doubled in two runs.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The start of the game was delayed by rain for 1 hour, 58
minutes. ... Belle has hit 20 homers in 10 straight seasons. ...
David Ortiz, who came in on a 24-for-45 tear, went 0-for-3 with two
strikeouts. ... Minnesota's Chad Moeller struck out in all three
at-bats.

<HEADLINE> Biggio Out for Season With Torn ACL  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Houston Astros second baseman Craig Biggio is out
for the season after tearing ligaments in his left knee Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Biggio, 34, tore the anterior cruciate and medial collateral
ligaments in the knee during a collision with Florida's Preston
Wilson in the seventh inning of Houston's 4-3 victory.
</P>
<P>
   With Wilson on first base, Mike Lowell hit a grounder to third.
Chris Truby threw to second base and Wilson slid into Biggio, who
was covering the base and landed hard.
</P>
<P>
   ''As soon as I saw him go down, I knew it wasn't going to be
good,'' said pitcher Scott Elarton, who got the win Tuesday night.
''This is a tough loss for us. We don't have many vocal leaders in
our clubhouse, but he's a guy who leads by what he does on the
field.''
</P>
<P>
   Biggio will remain with the team through the Marlins series and
return to Houston for an MRI on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's going to be tough to look over at second and not see him
there,'' Elarton said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's the emotional centerpiece of our team,'' Astros manager
Larry Dierker said. ''He plays with such energy, and with a rage to
win. It rubs off on the others. He makes every pitch and every
at-bat seem so important because of how he plays the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Biggio, a seven-time All-Star and four-time Gold Glove winner,
had never been on the disabled list in 13 major league seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's unlikely to see players do that,'' Dierker said.
''Obviously, Cal Ripken and Lou Gehrig went much longer, but you
just don't see anybody playing as long as he has without going on
the injured list.''
</P>
<P>
   Astros GM Gerry Hunsicker said no date had been set for surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Biggio struggled through a subpar season with a .268 batting
average, his lowest since 1989. He had eight home runs and 35 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Biggio led the National League in doubles the past two seasons,
including a career-high 56 last season, but had just 13 this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Biggio's struggles have coincided with the team's. A year after
winning the NL Central, the Astros are 40-66 -- the worst record in
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been that kind of year for us,'' Hunsicker said. ''It
seems like there has been one thing after another. It has been a
year to forget, and this just adds to it.''

<HEADLINE> Braves 4, Diamondbacks 2  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- Andruw Jones hit a two-run homer into the glove
of a fan reaching over the left-field fence and Brian Jordan also
homered as the Atlanta Braves rallied to beat the Arizona
Diamondbacks 4-2 on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's seventh loss in 10 games dropped the Diamondbacks out
of at least a share of the NL West lead for the first time since
the April 5. San Francisco beat Milwaukee 13-8 to take a one-game
lead.
</P>
<P>
   With one out in the eighth and the Braves down 2-0, Jones lifted
a fly ball to left field off Armando Reynoso. Luis Gonzalez tracked
the ball to the wall and leaped to make the catch. But the ball
landed in the glove of a fan reaching just over the fence, giving
Jones his 26th homer and allowing the Braves to tie it.
</P>
<P>
   The man who caught Jones' homer was eventually moved to another
section of the stadium by security guards because he was being
hassled by other fans.
</P>
<P>
   Chipper Jones then singled off reliever Greg Swindell (2-4) and
Jordan hit a more conventional homer, his 14th, six rows into the
left-field stands off Johnny Ruffin to give the Braves a 4-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Millwood (7-8), who retired the first 13 batters he faced
and faced the minimum through six innings, allowed two runs and two
hits in seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   John Rocker walked two batters in the ninth before being
replaced by Mike Remlinger with one out. Remlinger got two outs for
his 10th save in 12 chances.
</P>
<P>
   Reynoso was nearly as sharp as Millwood, allowing two runs and
six hits in 7 1-3 innings. He retired 12 straight hitters between
the fourth and seventh innings.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Finley ended Millwood's no-hit bid with a bloop single in
the fifth, but was retired on a double play.
</P>
<P>
   Millwood walked Jay Bell with one out in the seventh. Gonzalez
followed with a double to the wall in left-center field, scoring
Bell, and advanced to third on B.J. Surhoff's throw home. Gonzalez
scored on Matt Williams' sacrifice fly to give Arizona a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Reynoso, who was 0-8 in 14 appearances against Atlanta entering
the game, pitched out of trouble in the second inning.
</P>
<P>
   Surhoff, acquired by the Braves from Baltimore on Monday, hit a
one-out double in his first NL at-bat and Reynoso hit Javy Lopez on
the hands. But Reynoso came back to strike out Keith Lockhart and
Millwood on called third strikes to end the threat.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Surhoff extended his major league-leading consecutive games
streak to 428, with the help of Atlanta's off-day Monday. He
finished 1-for-3. ... Ruffin was making his first major league
appearance since Sept. 15, 1996. ... There were nearly 14,000 empty
seats for the first meeting between the division leaders. ... Wally
Joyner had a pinch single in the eighth for his 2,000th career hit.
... Arizona optioned 1B Erubiel Durazo to Triple-A Tucson of the
Pacific Coast League and recalled OF Jason Conti, who started in
right field. Durazo was 4-for-25 on the Diamondbacks' just
completed nine-game road trip. ... Conti took a probably double
away from Lopez in the seventh when he ranged into center field and
backhanded a drive to the warning track on the dead run.

<HEADLINE> Freedom Sought For Colombia Police  </HEADLINE>
By JARED KOTLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- The transformation of Ana Maria
Hernandez from cosmetics saleswoman to peace activist began a year
ago, the day her son was captured during a firefight with
Colombia's leftist rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Marched into the jungles on July 12, 1999, Heiver Hernandez
joined the ranks of the more than 500 police and soldiers taken
captive by the rebel Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or
FARC, in their long war with the government.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels say they will release their captives only in a
prisoner exchange with some 450 guerrillas held in government
jails. President Andres Pastrana has ruled out such a deal.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly the 15,000-strong FARC has taken to attacking rural
hamlets without warning, pitting hundreds of rebels against usually
no more than a dozen or two officers, who are killed in the fight
or executed afterward. FARC is, apparently, no longer taking
prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   With a military rescue operation deemed too risky, frustration
mounts daily for the captives and their families. Escape is on
their minds, but a failed attempt can mean death. Last year, rebels
tracked down and executed five policemen and a soldier who tried to
escape.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the men have spent more than three years in captivity.
Marriages have unraveled. Babies are growing up fatherless.
</P>
<P>
   But now, a protest movement led by wives and mothers of the
captured servicemen is putting pressure on both sides in the
conflict. Taking a page from mothers' movements that challenged
dictatorships in Chile and Argentina, the women appear in white
T-shirts emblazoned with photos of their missing loved ones.
</P>
<P>
   They've picketed the presidency, occupied a Catholic church in
Bogota and traveled into the jungles to meet with the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent round of peace talks, one woman stood for hours
before a stage crowded with government and rebel envoys. A strip of
masking tape across her mouth read simply: ''Freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez's odyssey began last year, when hundreds of FARC
fighters overran a small police post in the southern ranching town
of Puerto Rico. The garrison was one of dozens hit during a weekend
rebel offensive in which as many as 300 people died.
</P>
<P>
   When Hernandez heard of the attack, she rushed to a police
station that was in radio contact with her son's besieged unit.
</P>
<P>
   ''It sounded horrible, as if it were the end of the world,'' she
recalled. ''There was a huge explosion and the signal went dead.''
</P>
<P>
   A list of government fatalities was circulated days later, but
her son's name did not appear. One month later, at the FARC's
invitation and expense, Hernandez and 600 other family members of
rebel captives traveled in buses to the FARC-held town of San
Vicente Caguan, where they received letters from their loved ones
in captivity.
</P>
<P>
   It was then that Hernandez learned her son was alive.
</P>
<P>
   The event -- complete with a barbecue lunch and rebel speeches
demanding the prisoner exchange -- was televised, triggering
accusations that the rebels were cruelly manipulating the families'
feelings, and that the women were getting too close the FARC.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, many of the mothers have lashed out at the government.
They say military commanders are incompetent and that an uncaring
political elite has sent men into battle without proper training,
equipment or support.
</P>
<P>
   ''The police and soldiers are sons of peasants, humble people,''
Hernandez says. ''Pastrana doesn't care about them.''
</P>
<P>
   Having quit her cosmetics job, the 40-year-old Hernandez is now
living off her son's paycheck and loans from her sister, and has
dedicated herself to the liberation of her son and other captured
government security forces. She has made two more trips to San
Vicente del Caguan and spoken personally with the FARC commander
holding Heiver somewhere in northern Colombia
</P>
<P>
   But in an unusual step, she is also writing heartfelt letters to
Manuel ''Sureshot'' Marulanda, the FARC's 70-year-old founder and
leader.
</P>
<P>
   She tells Marulanda that her son is a good person who joined the
police only because he had no better opportunities. Violence is not
the way, Hernandez writes, but adds that Marulanda is correct to
challenge Colombia's rampant poverty and corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez clings to hope that Marulanda will be moved by her
words -- although it is not clear if he has even read them -- and
free the FARC captives as a grand gesture that could catapult the
peace process forward.
</P>
<P>
   ''If he reads my writings, I'm convinced he'll do something to
show the world he doesn't just destroy -- that he can do good
things, too,'' Hernandez says hopefully.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Invasion Left Mark on Kuwait  </HEADLINE>
By DIANA ELIAS
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUWAIT (AP) -- It took Iraqi tanks just a few hours to invade
this small, oil-rich country 10 years ago. Since then,
determination by Kuwait and its neighbors to never again be so
vulnerable has changed the political landscape in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after a U.S.-led coalition liberated Kuwait in the 1991
Gulf War, the country signed a 10-year defense pact with
Washington. Similar agreements followed with Britain, France, and
Russia as well as a defense agreement with other Gulf states.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel that Kuwait is one of the safest countries in the
world,'' lawmaker Abdul-Mohsen Jamal said a decade after the day
Kuwaitis call ''Black Thursday'' -- Aug. 2, 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to billions of dollars that Kuwait had stashed away from
oil earnings, physical scars of the invasion have been removed.
Blazes in oil wells that were set afire by retreating Iraqis were
extinguished. Equipment looted from government offices, the
university, and hospitals has been replaced.
</P>
<P>
   However, people in this state of 2.3 million people, the
majority of whom are guest workers, are still shocked that an Arab
country would take over another overnight.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our wounds have not healed,'' said the editorial of a special
issue of Al-Anba daily to mark the anniversary. ''On the contrary
they hurt with every new dawn and whenever we close our eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Kuwait and other members of the Gulf Cooperation Council -- Saudi
Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Oman, Bahrain and Qatar --
established a nucleus of a common army in a mutual defense pact.
But it's clear they believe their real defense lies in their
relationship with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq's aggression led neighboring Saudi Arabia to allow into the
country some 500,000 foreign troops, most of them American. The
legacy of that decision is still felt politically and economically
in the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   Western pressure helped edge King Fahd to decree some limited
political reforms, the $60 billion bill helped drain the Saudi
kingdom's reserves, and the presence of foreign troops gave birth
to a fundamentalist Saudi opposition.
</P>
<P>
   In Kuwait, political scientist Abdullah al-Shayeji said his
government is spending 25 percent of its annual budget on security,
in addition to some $12 billion earmarked for defense after
Kuwait's liberation. Lawmaker and former union leader Muslam
al-Barrak counted additional costs: He expected his country would
remain under U.S. political pressure to support the Mideast peace
process.
</P>
<P>
   But ''at the end of the day, we will never forget what America
did for us, regardless of how much it benefitted,'' al-Barrak said.
</P>
<P>
   As for Iraq, Kuwaitis say enmity between neighbors cannot go on
forever. Some predict a day when the two nations will reconcile and
perhaps join economic forces.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein is still in power, and Iraq
has not accounted for 605 Kuwaitis and citizens of other countries
who disappeared during the occupation.
</P>
<P>
   Baghdad says it has released all war prisoners, and in recent
years has accused Kuwait of withholding information on the fate of
1,150 of its citizens who disappeared during the crisis. Kuwait
says it cannot be held responsible for them at the time when Iraqi
authorities ran the country.
</P>
<P>
   Mariam al-Jassem, her husband and two sons were jailed in Iraq
for five months until the Iraqi opposition stormed their prison
right after the Gulf War. They were imprisoned after going to Iraq
in search of a third son who was caught distributing food and money
to fellow Kuwaitis during the occupation -- an act the Iraqis
apparently saw as insubordinate.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Jassem never saw that son again.
</P>
<P>
   She said, however, she would always remember the hospitality
Iraqi opposition extended to the freed prisoners, putting them up
in their homes for three days before they drove them to the safety
of the border.
</P>
<P>
   ''The people of Iraq are innocent victims,'' she said. ''It's
their government that is to blame.''

In the latest violence, the attackers raided a village late Tuesday in the
Anantnag area of central Kashmir, lining up and shooting to death 18 men, the
Press Trust of India reported. Those killed were workers at a brick factory who
had migrated from other Indian states for work, the agency said. That bloodshed
came hours after 30 unarmed Hindu pilgrims and Muslims porters were killed by
the suspected rebels as the group made its way to a religious shrine in the
disputed state.

<HEADLINE> Soldiers Help Fight Western Fires  </HEADLINE>
By BILL MARTINEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIDGECREST, Calif. (AP) -- Thunderstorms dropping more lightning
bolts than rain ignited new fires across the West Tuesday as the
military began deploying soldiers to bolster firefighters battling
infernos reducing forests, brush and grasslands to ash.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-five large fires were burning on more than 638,000 acres
of parched wildlands in Arizona, California, Idaho, Montana,
Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Utah and Wyoming, according to the
National Interagency Fire Center in Boise, Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   Six hundred soldiers from Fort Hood, Texas, arrived in Boise,
Idaho, for training to fight a 15,000-acre blaze in west-central
Idaho's Payette National Forest.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think anybody believes it will be enjoyable, but it's
something to help the country,'' said Spec. Keith Weiss, his
camouflage pants topped by a yellow fire shirt.
</P>
<P>
   At Camp Pendleton, 500 Marines were receiving firefighting
training to join crews on the lines of a blaze near the
Idaho-Montana line by the end of the week. In all, some 20,000
firefighters were working fires in the Western states.
</P>
<P>
   Weather prevailing over much of the West offered only prospects
for lengthening the siege: high temperatures, wind and dry
thunderstorms with lots of lightning.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not getting any rain at all. If it's raining it's not
hitting the ground,'' said Ed Waldapfel, information officer for
the fire center in Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   One exception was California's southern Sierra Nevada, where
rain helped firefighters get a handle on a 67,000-acre brush fire
that destroyed several homes earlier in the week.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, conditions were expected to remain unchanged for the
next three or four days and possibly more than a week, Waldapfel
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're at the end of a La Nina weather event this year and
everything is critically dry,'' he said. ''We've had virtually no
moisture this spring and summer. ... It's just a very combustible
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   In California, geography had been the enemy of firefighters
battling the 67,000-acre inferno burning in Sequoia National Forest
at altitudes around 6,000 feet in the southern Sierra Nevada.
Constructing fire lines was a slow, literally uphill battle.
</P>
<P>
   ''A person can get on the hill and outcrawl us,'' said bulldozer
operator Bob O'Keefe, describing the terrain with a near-vertical
sweep of his hand.
</P>
<P>
   Then finally on Tuesday firefighters began to make some headway
against the blaze that began July 22, raising their containment
level of it from 15 percent to 40 percent. They said that was
partly because the area was one of the few in the West to get some
rain out of the thunderstorms.
</P>
<P>
   Fire crews have gone days without sleep or showers since the
start of the blaze, which officials estimate will be fully
contained by Aug. 10.
</P>
<P>
   ''It got to the point where the bugs didn't come near us,''
O'Keefe said.
</P>
<P>
   The fire destroyed seven homes in the isolated community of
Kennedy Meadows, a usually cool retreat for fishing and camping
enthusiasts high above the deserts of southeastern California,
about 35 miles northwest of Ridgecrest.
</P>
<P>
   The intensity of the blaze as well as the determination of
firefighters was evident at the end of a bumpy, four-mile drive
into a canyon, where Roy Harmon's home survived amid blackened
skeletons of pinon pines and charcoal shadows of sagebrush.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I got 100 yards into the canyon I thought, 'There's no
way in hell anything can still be standing,''' said Harmon. But it
was. Scorched earth revealed how the fire burned up to the front of
the house before it was stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Sam and Joyce Taggart's home also was left standing, but only a
row of unscathed poplar trees relieved the view of a devastated
landscape.
</P>
<P>
   ''Looking at it just knocks me out,'' Sam Taggart said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Liked Ritter Better First Time  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Once one of President Saddam Hussein's chief
tormentors, Scott Ritter is now a changed man.
</P>
<P>
   The former U.N. weapons inspector is spending the week in Iraq,
convinced that Saddam no longer poses a military threat to his
neighbors. The Clinton administration believes Ritter is wasting
his time.
</P>
<P>
   Ritter turned up in Baghdad last weekend with a camera crew to
videotape weapons sites so he can assess first hand what the Iraqis
have been up to since Saddam shut down the U.N. operation in
December 1998. Ritter plans to make a documentary in hopes of
dispelling what he believes are rumors about Iraq's weapons
activities.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration wants to replace the shuttered U.N.
operation with a new one that has been authorized by the U.N.
Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   National Security Council spokesman P.J. Crowley believes the
replacement agency will be better positioned than Ritter to make
judgments about Iraqi military might.
</P>
<P>
   ''Having Iraq host Scott Ritter for a 'thanks for the memories'
documentary is lovely but it doesn't substitute for full
cooperation with the U.N. inspection regime,'' Crowley says.
</P>
<P>
   ''They had the opportunity to cooperate with Ritter when he was
actually an inspector but didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Says State Department spokesman Philip Reeker, ''I think it's
fairly obvious we don't agree with some of the assertions made by
Mr. Ritter.''
</P>
<P>
   Ritter resigned in a huff two years ago as a top U.N. weapons
inspector in Iraq, accusing the administration ago of not
supporting that effort aggressively enough. Now he is portraying
Iraq as the victim of misguided U.N. Security Council disarmament
resolutions with which, he says, it will be impossible for Baghdad
to comply. In addition, he believes U.N. sanctions should be
lifted.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. government disagrees, its opinion of Saddam unchanged
since he invaded Kuwait and tried to annex it. The State Department
is using the occasion of the Wednesday's 10th anniversary of the
invasion to call attention at a news conference to Saddam's
perceived misdeeds. Not long ago, the State Department called him a
''mad dictator.''
</P>
<P>
   Ritter's apostasy has alienated Richard Butler, the former
chairman of UNSCOM, the shorthand term for the now-defunct U.N.
inspection agency.
</P>
<P>
   In response to Ritter's contention in the magazine Arms Control
Today that UNSCOM left Iraq ''qualitatively disarmed,'' Butler said
the ''facts are clear and alarming, and they do not support this
assertion.''
</P>
<P>
   Butler used to be one of Ritter's biggest boosters, once calling
him ''a professional officer of the highest quality.''
</P>
<P>
   Saddam also has changed his mind about Ritter, inviting him to
Iraq this week after accusing him during his UNSCOM days of being a
spy and demanding that he be removed from the inspection team.
</P>
<P>
   After arriving in Iraq last Saturday, Ritter told Iraqi
reporters that there has been a lot of ''irresponsible
speculation'' about alleged Iraqi efforts to rebuild weapons of
mass destruction since Saddam cut off cooperation with UNSCOM in
December 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In his June 2000 magazine piece, Ritter said UNSCOM's seven-year
inspection effort accomplished a lot.
</P>
<P>
   ''Because of the work carried out by UNSCOM, it can be fairly
stated that Iraq was qualitatively disarmed at the time inspectors
were withdrawn,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ''By the end of 1998, Iraq had, in fact, been disarmed to a
level unprecedented in modern history, but UNSCOM and the Security
Council were unable and in some instances unwilling to acknowledge
this accomplishment.''
</P>
<P>
   Butler, his one-time admirer, disagrees. Saddam is
''manufacturing the weapons of mass destruction with which he
threatens the Iraqi people, his neighbors and, by extension, the
safety of the world,'' Butler said recently.

<HEADLINE> Kansans Electing Board of Education  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID MILES
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) -- Kansas Board of Education candidates who
supported science standards that de-emphasize evolution were
defeated in three GOP primaries Tuesday. The board member who
helped write the standards staved off a challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Holloway, who supported the new standards as board
chairwoman last year and spent thousands in her re-election
campaign, lost to Sue Gamble 60 percent to 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Holloway said she was surprised by her loss, which she
attributed to criticism of the board's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''Unfortunately, I guess propaganda still works,'' she said.
Gamble saw her nomination as a rejection of the standards.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's a validation of parents and other community
people speaking for their schools and quality education,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Incumbent Mary Douglass Brown, who supported the standards, was
defeated by Carol Rupe, who opposed the board's decision, by 52
percent to 48 percent. And moderate Bruce Wyatt led Brad Angell 58
percent to 42 percent with 99 percent of the vote counted. Angell
supports the standards, while Wyatt wants to change them. They are
seeking the seat vacated by a member who voted for the standards.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Abrams, who helped write the standards, defeated Roger
Rankin, who campaigned against the standards, 62 percent to 38
percent.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time voters got a chance to decide whether the
standards approved last year should cost board members their jobs.
Holloway, Abrams and Brown, conservatives who voted for the
standards, were challenged by moderates who opposed the decision.
</P>
<P>
   Not all 10 seats on the board are up for re-election this year,
but Tuesday's votes could help tip the balance on the board, which
voted 6-4 last year to approve the standards.
</P>
<P>
   In the Nov. 7 general election, the primary winners will face
Democrats who oppose the standards.
</P>
<P>
   The standards, which school districts do not have to follow,
play down the importance of evolution and omit the big-bang theory
of the universe's origin. They also provide the basis for statewide
student assessment tests to be introduced next spring.
</P>
<P>
   Critics argue that the move makes the state look backward, but
proponents say it lets local school districts decide what to teach.
Some of those who have attacked the teaching of evolution believe
in creationism.
</P>
<P>
   The issue drew international attention and generated
unprecedented campaign contributions.
</P>
<P>
   It also created rifts in the Kansas Republican Party by becoming
the new litmus test of whether someone is conservative or moderate.
</P>
<P>
   In one Republican congressional primary, moderate Greg Musil
criticized the board's decision in radio and TV ads. His
conservative opponents, including state Rep. Phill Kline, did not
discuss evolution.
</P>
<P>
   Musil's strategy didn't work against Kline's promises to fight
for tax cuts, however. Kline defeated Musil 50 percent to 37
percent, with all but two precincts reporting. Gary Morsch, a
political newcomer, had 13 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Kline will face first-term Rep. Dennis Moore, the state's only
Democratic congressman, in November. There were no primary races in
the state's other three congressional districts.
</P>
<P>
   In past years, Board of Education candidates could spend less
than $500 on a primary race and stand a chance of getting elected.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the most hotly contested races this year, Holloway
raised more than $74,000 in cash contributions, loaned herself
$15,000 and then spent $35,000 on TV ads to defend her vote for the
standards.
</P>
<P>
   Gamble, her opponent in the suburban Kansas City district,
pledged to vote to reverse the board's decision if elected. She
raised about $35,000.
</P>
<P>
   The theory of evolution, developed by Charles Darwin and other
thinkers, holds that the Earth is billions of years old and that
life forms developed over hundreds of millions of years.
</P>
<P>
   Creationism maintains that evolution cannot be proven and that
the Earth and most life forms came into existence suddenly about
6,000 years ago, largely as described in the Bible.

<HEADLINE> Nearly 50 Killed in Kashmir Attacks  </HEADLINE>
By QAISER MIRZA
<TEXT>
<P>
   PAHALGAM, India (AP) -- Four massacres by suspected Islamic
guerrillas opposed to a cease-fire have killed 67 people within a
few hours in the disputed territory of Kashmir, police said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The separate attacks came as the Indian federal government
prepared to talk to the main guerrilla group in Kashmir, which has
been wracked by an Islamic insurgency for 11 years.
</P>
<P>
   Gunmen killed 11 people in the Hindu-dominated village of Pogal
in southern Kashmir Wednesday morning, said Police
Inspector-General S.P. Vaid of the Jammu district. The village is
108 miles south of Jammu, the winter capital of Jammu-Kashmir
state.
</P>
<P>
   There were three separate attacks Tuesday evening.

<HEADLINE> US Ship Holds Canada Military Gear  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   OTTAWA (AP) -- A cargo ship has anchored off Newfoundland and its
American owners have refused to deliver its load of Canadian
military gear until they are paid the money they say they are owed.
</P>
<P>
   Two Canadian warships, the destroyer HMCS Athabaskan and the
frigate HMCS Montreal were close by the cargo boat, the GTS Katie,
and the Defense Ministry said Tuesday it was weighing its options.
</P>
<P>
   The American owner of the Katie has decided ''he's not going to
move,'' Defense Department spokesman Alastair Mullin said. The ship
dropped anchor about 80 miles off the southeast tip of Newfoundland
island.
</P>
<P>
   ''Because of the situation of unresolved contractual obligations
we have no intention of raising the anchor until we have some kind
of resolution,'' Peter Margan, president of ship owner Third Ocean
Marine Navigation of Maryland, told CTV news.
</P>
<P>
   The ship was carrying 500 military vehicles -- including tanks
and armored personnel carriers -- and tons of other equipment. It
was contracted to bring the equipment back from Kosovo, where it
was deployed with Canadian peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   Three Canadian soldiers assigned to guard the cargo have spent
the last two weeks on board the ship watching videos and waiting
for settlement of the contract dispute between the shipowner and
Andromeda Navigation of Montreal, which chartered the ship.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer from Andromeda, which was contracted by the government
to get the equipment back to Canada, said the company was trying to
resolve the dispute.
</P>
<P>
   But so far it ''has spent over $850,000 of its own money to
bring the cargo to Canada and it hasn't received a cent yet from
the government,'' George Pollack told CTV news. Third Ocean says it
is still awaiting payment from Andromeda.
</P>
<P>
   The amount of money in dispute was not immediately available.
</P>
<P>
   The Katie was due in Montreal in mid-July, but it has been
circling in the Atlantic for two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The Defense Department routinely charters foreign-flag ships and
aircraft to haul equipment overseas. The navy has no transports
equipped to carry heavy armor and the air force's C-130 Hercules
transports are limited to about 20 tons of cargo.

<HEADLINE> Step Into Philly's Crowd and Listen  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT TANNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Pictures tell part of the story: a parade
across the podium; cheering crowds; red, white and blue everywhere.
Each person has another tale to tell. This week, the Republican
convention city is swarming with people, ideas, arguments. Step
into the downtown crush. Here's what some delegates, protesters and
workers have to say:
</P>
<P>
THE FAITHFUL
</P>
<P>
   ''People are looking for answers,'' says Debe McGuire. She's in
Philadelphia to offer a few. Here's her husband, Jim: ''Go back to
some of the things our fathers and mothers taught us about honesty
and sincerity.'' The two accountants are from northeast Texas -- as
if the straw cowboy hats didn't tell you -- and their political
views are in plain sight. ''Dubya'' buttons. The message ''The LIFE
of the party'' splashed across their backs. She's an alternate
delegate who helped start a local Christian Coalition chapter. The
McGuires are here to speak their minds and make sure the party
listens. ''Washington needs to hear from the people back home,''
she says.
</P>
<P>
THE FUND-RAISER
</P>
<P>
   When other children got dragged to museums, Jim Cox was off to
election rallies. His mom had the bug. Turned out it was
hereditary. ''I was hooked from an early age,'' says the
31-year-old Internet fund-raiser from Virginia. ''To me, the
neatest thing is to see people debate an issue.'' He's here
working, helping candidates raise money. But he's also here because
he loves it -- and as founder of a political action committee for
young Republicans. ''Regardless of where you fall on the
ideological spectrum, one of the most important things you need to
do as an American citizen is vote.''
</P>
<P>
THE SHORT-ORDER COOK
</P>
<P>
   Ronnie Fearon serves up home-cooked meals at the Down Home
Diner, not political insights. The convention? ''So far, I think
it's OK for the city, it's doing a lot of business for the city,''
says the 39-year-old cook who adopted Philadelphia as his hometown
after emigrating from Jamaica. He's registered to vote, and will be
back at the polls again this year, though none of the candidates
have him very excited. George W. Bush? ''I believe he's a nice
guy.'' Still, he'd prefer to just stick with the status quo. ''I
just feel comfortable with Bill Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
THE PACIFISTS
</P>
<P>
   Ruth and Ralph Johnson can teach these young protesters a few
things. She remembers marching against the Vietnam War, though the
exact year escapes her. ''Nixon was in the White House,'' she says.
The two are Quakers, both retired in their early 70s, but nowhere
near taking it easy. ''We are very upset,'' she says, and here's
why: military spending, the failed drug war, health care problems
and too many guns. And neither the Republicans or the Democrats do
anything substantial to fix it, they say. ''That's why (the voters)
stay home,'' says Ruth. ''They say 'ho-hum,''' says Ralph,
finishing the thought. The two came from Delaware to march and have
their say. But they made sure to stop for the Sunday meeting of
Friends in Philadelphia. Their prayer? ''A new millennium of
peace.''
</P>
<P>
THE CHAIRWOMAN
</P>
<P>
   ''People are getting turned off by politics. It might be the age
of specialization. They're so busy out doing their thing,'' says
Barbara Marumoto, one of Hawaii's few Republican legislators and
her delegation's chairwoman. A pen behind her ear, an armful of
books in her hand and a pocket full of surfboard logos (her son
sells them), she also balances political hopes with reality. Her
state tends to go Democratic, but Marumoto, a 22-year veteran of
the state House, says this year might be different. As the
granddaughter of Japanese immigrants, here's her reason: ''Bush's
message of welcoming legal immigrants in the country will resonate
very well in Hawaii,'' she says. ''He realizes the value and the
contributions of different ethnic groups.''
</P>
<P>
   This threesome of 20-year-olds from Haverford College doesn't
feel too welcome here. Carrying a poster calling for the release of
a convicted cop-killer doesn't go over too well at a gathering of
the GOP faithful. But Jared Tankel, Neal Kronley and Brady
McCartney are committed. ''It really shines a lot of light on what
we're doing -- which is the state murdering people,'' says Kronley.
The three take the bus in each day to protest. They also hoped to
see the sights, but their poster got them thrown out of a public
exhibition hall downtown, they said. ''A lot of these people don't
really want to listen,'' Tankel says. ''We're kind of putting it in
their faces so that they're forced to look at it and at least read
it.''
</P>
<P>
THE ACTRESS
</P>
<P>
   Lala Babin is 12 and dreams of Broadway. But politics is fun,
too: ''I like history, so I was excited when my mom told me that I
could come here.'' She's in the spirit -- sporting plastic beads
that blink red, white and blue; a towering hat of red, white and
blue a la Cat-in-the-Hat; glittering glasses that read ''2000.''
Her mom's an alternate from Texas (they live in ''a weed'' of a
town just over the line from Louisiana) and her friends were a bit
jealous of her trip -- though not all of them get the point. ''Some
of my friends don't even know what Republicans and Democrats are.''
Though acting calls her, she's already dabbled in politics. Last
summer she was elected chief of one of the two tribes at her summer
camp.

<HEADLINE> Charles Thone a Convention Veteran  </HEADLINE>
By TED ANTHONY
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- They bunked together, five to a room. They
came and went as they pleased -- no metal detectors, no roped-off
city blocks, no black-clad guys with pants tucked into
don't-mess-with-me boots. And then there's this: Back then, the
outcome was actually in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   That was Chicago in July 1952. Dwight D. Eisenhower and Robert
Taft both wanted the GOP presidential nomination. Intrigue was
everywhere. And Charles Thone, fresh from Hartington, Neb., was an
ambitious young Republican driving up to his very first national
convention.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was exhilarating. It was meaningful. Everybody's vote
counted. It was billed as the battle for the soul of the Republican
Party,'' says Thone, 76, a lawyer and former Nebraska governor and
four-term congressman who began attending GOP conventions in 1952.
''That's gone now.''
</P>
<P>
   His hair is white now, his forehead wrinkled. But Thone, here
for his 10th convention, can summon the memories and make himself
28 again, the farm boy turned lawyer. He knows how long he's been
around; he knows what he's seen.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wasn't born in a log cabin like Abraham Lincoln. But I came
from a rusty, dusty farm,'' he says. ''Sometimes I would stand back
and wonder how I got there.''
</P>
<P>
   Thone, a World War II veteran, remembers the excitement of his
first convention. Television was new; all its big names were there
-- Murrow, Cronkite, Sevareid. Nebraska's delegation was seated
behind New York's, where political powerhouse Thomas Dewey held
court.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was in the major leagues of politics,'' he marvels.
</P>
<P>
   He and other younger delegates were aggressively ''wooed'' by
both Eisenhower's and Taft's people. Back-room posturing abounded --
something many say is missing from today's scripted affairs. ''You
could cut the intrigue with a knife,'' Thone says.
</P>
<P>
   He went on to attend all the conventions he could. He missed
1956's because he had too much work, 1964's because he was running
for lieutenant governor and 1976's because he was preparing to run
for governor (he won).
</P>
<P>
   His presence in Philadelphia -- an imposing figure in slate-blue
suit and yellow floor pass -- represents the institutional memory of
a man who has wound through public life in his state and Washington
since the 1940s. You name 'em, he's probably been in their White
House.
</P>
<P>
   ''They all had strengths and weaknesses,'' he says. ''Maybe it
gives me a qualitative appreciation of this whole nominating and
electing process.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a weird time for a GOP party veteran. The old Republican
guard is fading: Nixon is dead, Reagan hobbled by Alzheimer's, Ford
87 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Even Sen. Strom Thurmond, 97, who's been attending conventions
since 1932, is absent this week. An Associated Press survey of most
of the 2,066 delegates indicates that without Thurmond here, Thone
is the most experienced hand in attendance.
</P>
<P>
   Yet younger Republicans are seeking new icons. On Monday, Kevin
McCarthy, the Young Republicans chairman, insisted that the GOP is
''not your grandfather's Republican Party.'' Note to Kevin
McCarthy: Your grandfather's people -- people like Thone -- still
have wisdom to impart.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, it may be cool to have The Rock -- wrestler, provoker of
large men, violent deployer of furniture -- join House Speaker
Dennis Hastert on the convention stage. But Thone prefers to
remember an age when partisanship and showmanship didn't trump
respect.
</P>
<P>
   ''You've kind of lost that,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere on the convention floor this week are four
19-year-olds, the convention's youngest delegates. They're feeling
what Thone felt during that week in Chicago so long ago. And he has
a thought for them.
</P>
<P>
   ''I guess I'd sermonize just a little and tell them that most
politicians, most officeholders -- Republican, Democrat, Independent
-- are decent, hard-working people, contrary to the public
perception,'' he says. ''Most of them do care.''
</P>
<P>
   He smiles.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's the sermon from an old gray head. There's so much good
about it all.''

<HEADLINE> Bush Fires Back at the White House  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE KELLMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   GETTYSBURG, Pa. (AP) -- Firing back at the White House, George W.
Bush says the nation is ''tired of the politics of personal
destruction'' and that he would uphold the same high standards set
by former Presidents Reagan, Ford and Bush.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of his nomination as the Republican presidential
candidate, Bush said he was ''riled up'' by President Clinton's
increasingly personal attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's amazing to me that the president of the United States
would spend time trying to be a political pundit,'' Bush told
reporters aboard his plane. ''He's so desperate to have his legacy
intact by getting Al Gore elected, he'll say anything, just like
Gore will.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, in a satellite address to the convention, Bush praised
three former presidents, including his father. ''They served with
honor and set high standards that I will work hard to uphold.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's father and Gerald Ford, who was later taken to a hospital
reportedly suffering from bronchitis, sat in the convention hall.
Ronald Reagan, who is suffering from Alzheimer's disease, was
represented by his wife, Nancy.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton belittled the Texas governor's campaign Monday, saying
one reason he was in the running was because his ''daddy was
president.'' The elder Bush, who was defeated by Clinton in 1992,
quickly stepped in, threatening to go public with his true feelings
about the president ''as a human being and as a person.'' If
Clinton doesn't back off, he said, the family might unleash former
first lady Barbara Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign jumped in.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has to send his father out to defend him,'' spokesman Chris
Lehane told reporters. ''People are starting to wonder, does he
have what it takes?''
</P>
<P>
   Entering the fray, Bush broke a self-imposed ban on attacking
his opponent by name.
</P>
<P>
   ''This nation is sick and tired of the politics of personal
destruction; they want are uniter, not a divider,'' Bush said at a
rally in front of West Virginia's Veterans Memorial. ''This nation
does not want four more years of Clinton-Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   During a rally Tuesday at the Pennsylvania Statehouse in
Harrisburg, Bush told about 3,000 supporters that he would bring to
Washington ''an administration that will raise this country's
sights, an administration that will have big goals for the nation,
an administration that sets a positive, optimistic tone.''
</P>
<P>
   Before heading to Philadelphia and the GOP convention, Bush
stopped in Gettysburg to pay homage to two of the party's most
enduring heroes, Abraham Lincoln and Dwight Eisenhower.
</P>
<P>
   In his satellite address to the convention, Bush saluted
Eisenhower's comments that there was ''no such thing'' as a
Democratic or a Republican president.
</P>
<P>
   ''I seek to become president of all the people,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   He also praised two former rivals, John McCain for his
''straight talk and strong convictions,'' and Elizabeth Dole, ''a
pioneer who is a role model for so many of our daughters.''
</P>
<P>
   Spokeswoman Karen Hughes said Bush took time out from
campaigning to practice his acceptance speech before TelePrompTers
in the living room of the governor's mansion while his senior aides
and Gov. Tom Ridge watched.

<HEADLINE> Odd Couple Joins in Holocaust Issue  </HEADLINE>
By FREDERIC J. FROMMER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Beyond their work together on the historic
effort to compensate Holocaust victims for unpaid insurance
policies, Lawrence Eagleburger and Glenn Pomeroy have little in
common.
</P>
<P>
   Pomeroy, a cheery 44-year-old, is the Democratic insurance
commissioner for North Dakota. Eagleburger, a gruff 69-year-old who
chain-smokes between puffs of his asthma inhaler, is a Republican
former secretary of state who has traveled the globe on behalf of
the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
   Possibly the only thing they have in common is that neither is
Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   They teamed up in 1998 when Pomeroy, president of the National
Association of Insurance Commissioners, helped tap Eagleburger as
the first chairman of the International Commission on Holocaust Era
Insurance Claims. Pomeroy is a member.
</P>
<P>
   ''We felt we needed somebody from the outside, someone with
clout and leadership and world presence,'' Pomeroy said.
</P>
<P>
   ''And they couldn't find him, so they took me,'' Eagleburger
joked.
</P>
<P>
   The commission, established two years ago by five European
insurers, U.S. and European regulators and Jewish groups, settles
unpaid insurance policies issued between 1920 and 1945.
</P>
<P>
   Many Holocaust victims or survivors were denied payment of
claims after World War II because insurance companies demanded
policies or death certificates as proof.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you went to Auschwitz, you didn't take your insurance
policy with you,'' Eagleburger said, referring to the infamous Nazi
concentration camp in Poland.
</P>
<P>
   The insurance companies now have agreed to assess claims based
on relaxed standards of proof, such as receipts and anecdotal
evidence. Two companies -- Assicurazioni Generali of Italy and
Allianz AG of Germany -- already have agreed to pay roughly $150
million each in Holocaust claims.
</P>
<P>
   The commission has received 30,000 claims since it began
accepting them in February. It forwards them to insurance
companies. If they refuse to pay, or if the claimant finds a
counteroffer too small, appeals can be made to special panels
established by the commission.
</P>
<P>
   Successful claimants receive 10 times the value of the original
policy roughly to approximate its purchasing power of a
half-century ago.
</P>
<P>
   Eagleburger doesn't get involved in individual claims. He plays
judge and mediator on larger issues involving Jewish groups
representing claimants and the insurance companies -- Generali,
Allianz, AXA of France and Winterthur Leben and Zurich Financial
Services, both from Switzerland. Recently, a group of Dutch
insurance companies joined as well.
</P>
<P>
   As representative of U.S. insurance regulators, Pomeroy provides
leverage against the companies, all of which have subsidiaries in
the United States. Aiding him are laws in Minnesota, California,
New York, Florida, Washington and Maryland authorizing insurance
commissioners to forbid companies from doing business in the state
if they refuse to cooperate with the commission.
</P>
<P>
   Eagleburger said that on several occasions he has brought
Pomeroy into private meetings with insurance company officials ''so
I could be in a position of saying, 'If you guys aren't careful, I
can always unleash the regulators on you.'''
</P>
<P>
   Pomeroy's involvement came almost by accident. He was president
of the commissioners' association when some members spoke of
tackling the Holocaust compensation problem.
</P>
<P>
   ''States were not of one mind in how to deal with it,'' Pomeroy
said.
</P>
<P>
   It helped that Pomeroy came from North Dakota, a state with a
tiny Jewish population, said Elan Steinberg, the World Jewish
Congress representative to the commission.
</P>
<P>
   ''Politically and geographically, he's a commissioner from a
state where there is no political benefit for him in engaging in
this kind of activity,'' Steinberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg likens Pomeroy to a Jimmy Stewart character -- gentle,
''almost timid'' on the outside, but with a steely interior.
</P>
<P>
   Eagleburger, on the other hand, is ''blustery. He is tough
inside and out,'' Steinberg said. ''He's like a missile -- he's
dogged and he knows where he wants to end up, and he takes you
there.
</P>
<P>
   ''And it's these different personalities that have brought us
most of the accomplishments we have in the commission.''
</P>
<P>
   William Webster, a former FBI and CIA director who represents
the French company AXA, said Eagleburger's job is like ''herding
cats,'' with five insurance commissioners, five insurance companies
and five Jewish organizations on the commission.

<HEADLINE> Search teams look for canoeist missing on the Delaware River  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   UPPER BLACK EDDY, Pa. (AP) - Rescue boats and divers searched
without success Tuesday for a missing canoeist whose dog and
equipment were found on the boat Monday, floating on the Delaware
River without him.
</P>
<P>
   The effort Tuesday turned up no sign of the victim after the
initial search Monday night was cut short by a thunderstorm, said a
spokesman for the Upper Black Eddy Fire Co. The search will likely
resume this morning, he said.
</P>
<P>
   A witness reported seeing a man without a shirt in a motorized
canoe on the river north of Milford in the afternoon, said Mike
Sciss, deputy chief of the Upper Black Eddy Fire Co. By the time it
reached the Milford Bridge to Hunderdon County, N.J., the man was
gone, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another witness reported seeing a man getting out of a canoe
less than a half-mile above the bridge, but no sign of him was
found on land.
</P>
<P>
   A fishing license with a man's name was recovered from the boat,
along with two coolers, several changes of clothes, maps, a
lifejacket and some empty beer cans, Schiss said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It looks like he started up north,'' Sciss said. ''There's a
lot of gear; he may have been out for a couple of days.''
</P>
<P>
   The dog, part German shepherd, was so agitated that firfighters
could not get it out of the canoe, until officials from the
Hunterdon County SPCA came to restrain it.

<HEADLINE> Gay Congressman Talks About Trade  </HEADLINE>
By MATT KELLEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Arizona Rep. Jim Kolbe never strayed from
his free-trade theme in a three-minute speech to the Republican
National Convention and conservative GOP delegates, bowing to the
greater theme of party harmony, offered only mild, silent protest
to the GOP's only openly gay member of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Gay Republicans hailed the speech as an important sign of a thaw
in their party's relations with homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   But several members of the Texas delegation took off their
cowboy hats and bowed their heads in prayer as a silent protest
during Kolbe's speech. One held up a sign proclaiming, ''There is a
way out.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe there are moral rights and wrongs and we also
believe that if any one of us did wrong, we would want others to
pray for us,'' said Butch Davis of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the audience listened politely and gave Kolbe mild
applause.
</P>
<P>
   The current Republican platform opposes gay marriages, declares
''homosexuality is incompatible with military service'' and says
''we do not believe sexual preference should be given special legal
protection or standing in law.'' What's important, gay Republicans
say, is that Bush has not been so unfriendly.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's not perfect, but he's someone I respect and he's not a
mean-spirited bigot,'' said Washington, D.C., delegate David
Catania, a gay city councilman.
</P>
<P>
   Kolbe, 58, acknowledged being gay in 1996, but has not been a
vocal advocate for gay rights in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   This year 18 delegates and alternates to the convention are
openly gay, compared to five in 1996, said Kevin Ivers, a spokesman
for the Log Cabin Republicans.

<HEADLINE> In Market for a Steam Locomotive?  </HEADLINE>
By WAYNE PARRY
<TEXT>
<P>
   KEARNY, N.J. (AP) -- Fancy a locomotive?
</P>
<P>
   If so, you can snap up the one-of-a-kind Chesapeake &AMP; Ohio No.
614 for at least $1 million. The owner will even throw in two
auxiliary cars for free.
</P>
<P>
   But rail buffs and model train lovers take note: This little
beauty isn't going to fit under your kid's Christmas tree.
</P>
<P>
   It's an 890,000-pound, 112-foot long, fully functional steam
locomotive that can reach speeds of 125 mph. It's got enough muscle
to pull an Amtrak train.
</P>
<P>
   The train, one of the last steam passenger locomotives built in
the United States, is being sold because its owner plans a new
tourist railroad in Canada with bridges that can't support the
weight of old No. 614.
</P>
<P>
   An auction last month at the NJ Transit's Meadows Maintenance
Facility drew a high bid of only $200,000. But owner Ross Rowland
Jr. rejected the offer, saying his train is worth between $1
million to $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   With such a hefty price tag, the average rail buff won't be able
to afford it. It's been offered to Microsoft founder Bill Gates,
Wall Street whiz Warren Buffett, and actor Kevin Costner -- all
acknowledged train fanciers -- but they haven't bitten.
</P>
<P>
   So bids from anyone interested will be considered, auctioneer
David Barnhardt said Tuesday. If a suitable deal can't be struck at
a future auction, Barnhardt said, Rowland will donate the engine to
a rail museum.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was the last mainline steam engine built in North America
in 1948, as railroads were transitioning from steam to diesel,''
said Rowland, who has owned No. 614 since 1979, when he bought it
from the CSX railroad.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been thoroughly refurbished and updated, and it's the
only steam locomotive in North America that has all the equipment
and appliances you'd need to pull an Amtrak train.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it is the only steam engine ever leased by Amtrak,
having pulled ''The Cardinal'' through West Virginia at speeds
approaching 80 miles an hour.
</P>
<P>
   When Rowland bought it, he oversaw a crew of 15 mechanics and
more than 100 volunteers who completely rebuilt the locomotive. It
took 18 months and $1.5 million to bring No. 614 up to snuff; it
can now pull a 25-car passenger train all day without having to
stop for service.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland has been a train nut ever since he was a kid. Yes, he
said, he had a set of Lionel toy trains when he was 4 years old.
</P>
<P>
   ''But I quickly grew tired of those, and wanted the big ones,
the real ones,'' he said. ''I've been in love with trains ever
since I was a kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Ron Anderson, who maintains trains for the New York City Transit
Authority, stopped by the July 15 auction to take a peek at some
living history.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the last of its type,'' he said. ''I've seen it go on a
lot of excursions, and I just wanted to see it one last time.''
</P>
<P>
   Rowland appreciates the thought -- he loves the romance of the
rails.
</P>
<P>
   ''Without the steam engine, there would have been no westward
expansion,'' he said. ''It enabled the industrial revolution and
the population of the western two-thirds of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ''Combine that with the sights and sounds of a steam engine as
it passes by you -- the hiss of the steam, the sound of the whistle,
the way the ground shakes underneath you -- and it's almost an alive
machine.''

<HEADLINE> McCain Has His Moment at Convention  </HEADLINE>
By SCOTT THOMSEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- John McCain was where he hoped to be, on
stage at the Republican National Convention, but in the role of
vanquished challenger instead of the conquering hero.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it was a moment for his supporters to look back at
McCain's surprising campaign, during which he won primaries in New
Hampshire, Arizona, Michigan, Rhode Island, Connecticut,
Massachusetts and Vermont. And a moment to think of what might have
been as McCain told an appreciative crowd, ''We need to get riled
up a bit, and stand up for the values that made America great.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who joked with reporters earlier in the week that he is
in ''step eight of the 12-step program for former presidential
candidates,'' said he is proud his candidacy drew millions of new
voters to Republican primaries.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a good fight. We should be very proud,'' he said.
''That's good for our party and it's good for America.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain carried some of the trappings of that campaign to
Philadelphia. He rode into town on ''Straight Talk Express'' and
basked in media attention wherever he made an appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Now, McCain's efforts are directed toward helping elect George
W. Bush president. But that didn't stop some of his supporters from
reminiscing.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's bittersweet,'' said Arizona delegate Bettina Nava, who
worked on McCain's campaign staff. ''Certainly, we'd like to see
John up there. But he didn't win so you move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Delegate Jan Lynch of Phoenix stuffed envelopes for McCain's
presidential bid. Following McCain's lead, she's now backing Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a long way from that night when we won Arizona and
Michigan,'' she said. ''We're all still fiercely loyal to our
senator, John McCain, but very excited to elect George W. Bush as
president.''

<HEADLINE> Agents Dismantle Trafficking Ring  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal agents have arrested 140 people and
searched scores of sites from coast to coast as they dismantled a
nationwide ring allegedly supplying pseudoephedrine to clandestine
labs that turned it into methamphetamine.
</P>
<P>
   The distribution ring was headed by a group of 10 people, who
called themselves ''the Commission'' and shipped their profits to
the Middle East, Drug Enforcement Administration officials said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Agents arrested eight of those 10, including Hassan Zaghmot of
Denver. They found $650,000 in cash in Zaghmot's safe deposit box,
which he intended to use to finance a quick escape, according to
DEA officials, who requested anonymity. They said one of the 10 was
out of the country and the other may have fled after the latest
round of arrests began last Friday with Zaghmot's arrest after a
federal grand juror allegedly tipped him off about the sealed
indictment against him.
</P>
<P>
   The federal grand juror, Mark J. Hinckley, 37, of Evergreen,
Colo., was arrested Monday night in Denver night on charges that he
told Zaghmot last Thursday that the grand jury had returned a
sealed indictment against him. He was released Tuesday after making
bail. Federal agents watching Zaghmot on a court-approved concealed
camera saw and heard Hinckley ask for $50,000 for details of the
indictment, the government said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was the first time that U.S. law enforcement has been
able to connect a major group of pseudoephedrine distributors
directly to U.S.-based, Mexican-controlled methamphetamine
laboratory operators,'' said Joe Keefe, chief of DEA's special
operations division. These traffickers were charged with intent to
manufacturer methamphetamine; previously pseudoephedrine
traffickers had largely faced only civil penalties for diversion of
regulated substances, Keefe said.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno told a news conference, ''This
operation should send a message to anyone involved in
methamphetamine production and distribution that we are continuing
the fight in every way we know how so that this problem won't be
treating communities of America as crack did in the 1980s.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno and DEA Administrator Donnie Marshall announced that
Operation Mountain Express, begun in December 1999, had seized $8
million in cash, 10 metric tons of pseudoephedrine, capable of
producing 18,000 pounds of methamphetamine, 83 pounds of finished
methamphetamine, two pseudoephedrine extraction laboratories, one
methamphetamine laboratory and 136 pounds of processing chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   Some 100 of the arrests came over the course of the
investigation; another 40 were made since last Friday. Agents
searched 66 locations and used civil and administrative enforcement
actions to close down 18 pseudoephedrine companies, most controlled
by the commission.
</P>
<P>
   In April, agents seized 1,200 pounds of pseudoephedrine and
several million dollars in cash and arrested 14 couriers, which
officials said sent a shock wave through the organization. Using
informants, electronic surveillance and undercover agents, the
investigators learned that the commission called an emergency
meeting May 18 in Kissimmee, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   From informants at the meeting, agents learned that the
commissioners had decided to use only white Americans as couriers
to avoid law enforcement suspicions, to shift their use of
unwitting commercial courier companies regularly for fear some
would develop links with law enforcement and to assemble money and
devise plans for quick escapes from this country if there were
further raids.
</P>
<P>
   DEA officials said the commission set prices, determined the
methods of transportation, sent profits to Israel, Jordan, Syria
and Saudi Arabia and set up front companies to buy and ship
pseudoephedrine tablets to methamphetamine laboratories in southern
California.
</P>
<P>
   Pseudoephedrine tablets are imported for legal use in
over-the-counter cold and allergy remedies.
</P>
<P>
   DEA officials it costs $450 to make a pound of tablets for
legitimate use, but the traffickers would buy the tablets from
legitimate importers for $1,500 a pound, then ship them through a
series of front companies to the West Coast and sell them to
clandestine methamphetamine labs for $4,000 a pound. One pound of
tablets produces roughly a pound of methamphetamine, which is sold
for $14,000 to $15,000 a pound in the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, agents closed down Avance Pharmaceuticals in
Ronconkoma, N.Y., for its alleged involvement in this trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said that over the course of the investigation there
were arrests, searches or civil or administrative enforcement
actions in: Buffalo, N.Y.; New York; Ronconkoma, N.Y.; Camden and
Newark, N.J.; Philadelphia; Washington; Richmond, Va.; Greensboro,
N.C.; Detroit; Pittsburgh; Chicago; Cleveland; Kansas City, Mo.;
St. Louis; Columbus, Ohio; Nashville; Atlanta; Tampa, Orlando, Fort
Lauderdale and Miami, Fla.; New Orleans; Baton Rouge, La.; Oklahoma
City and Tulsa, Okla.; Denver; Las Vegas and Reno, Nev.; Seattle;
Portland, Ore.; Sacramento, San Francisco, San Jose, Fresno,
Riverside and Los Angeles, Calif.

<HEADLINE> New Voice, Lower Ratings for MNF  </HEADLINE>
By HOWARD FENDRICH
<TEXT>
<P>
   When ABC decided to put an irreverent comedian on ''Monday Night
Football,'' the thinking was it would freshen a stale show and
improve ratings that have been slipping for five seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The early returns are in, and while Dennis Miller added flavor
to the program, the national rating for his preseason debut
plummeted 28 percent from what the network drew for last year's
Hall of Fame Game.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's game between San Francisco and New England earned a 7.3
rating with a 13 share, well shy of the 10.1/18 for last year's
matchup between Dallas and Cleveland, which was also on a Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Bringing aboard a love-him-or-hate-him lightning rod didn't
electrify viewers in the largest markets, either. New York produced
a 5.9 both years, while Los Angeles dropped 23 percent from an 8.2
to a 6.3.
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 game had the advantages of starting an hour later, at 8
p.m. EDT, and of featuring ''America's Team'' and the return of the
Browns.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the big difference in ratings can't be comforting to
ABC.
</P>
<P>
   Miller's 7-10 p.m. EDT broadcast peaked with a 7.8 rating from
9-9:30, indicating people tuned in even when no-names were playing
and the outcome wasn't in doubt. But that was clobbered by CBS'
''Everybody Loves Raymond,'' which drew a 9.0 in that time slot.
</P>
<P>
   Each rating point represents 1 percent of the nation's estimated
100.8 million TV homes. Share is the percentage of in-use TVs tuned
to a given show.
</P>
<P>
   While Miller was laugh-out-loud funny at times, and by the end
of the show was working smoothly with boothmates Al Michaels and
Dan Fouts, he has improvements to make.
</P>
<P>
   His timing was often wrong. His one-liners sounded scripted, if
wonderfully esoteric. His forays into statistical analysis were
cloudy, poorly stated or just trailed off.
</P>
<P>
   At least once he got going -- he didn't utter a sound during the
49ers' opening drive -- Miller was rarely drab. He kept viewers on
their toes with references to everything from the Vatican to
Mesopotamia to Socrates to the Rosetta stone.
</P>
<P>
   The comedian's next test comes Aug. 14, when the Titans and Rams
play a preseason rematch of the Super Bowl. And the good news for
ABC is that there are still five weeks until the regular season
starts.
</P>
<P>
   By then, Miller, Michaels and Fouts will have had more time to
work out some kinks, as will new sideline reporters Eric Dickerson
and Melissa Stark.

<HEADLINE> NFL Camps Roundup  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Mike Shanahan walked off the practice field looking
like a
father whose children cleaned their room by sweeping the toys under
the bed.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ''We basically went through the motions,'' the coach said after
the Denver Broncos' only full-squad practice Tuesday. ''There were
a few good shots by a couple of different people, but overall I was
disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos, who play their first preseason game Saturday at
Arizona, botched pass protection and fumbled the ball on running
plays. They jumped offsides, dropped passes and missed assignments
in the secondary.
</P>
<P>
   Shanahan called the session the worst in the team's 12 days of
training camp.
</P>
<P>
   ''You're going to hit a wall,'' fullback Howard Griffith said.
''What day? It just happened to be today, I guess. We just have to
try to push through it. Everybody's tired. Nobody really likes
camp. That's just a fact, but we have to be here, so we might as
well get better.''
</P>
<P>
   Shanahan called on Griffith and other veterans to step forward
and act as leaders for younger players such as rookie cornerback
Deltha O'Neal and wide receiver Chris Cole.
</P>
<P>
   ''The vets can't let a poor practice happen,'' Shanahan said.
''You've got to have vets stand up and demand that people practice
at a certain level. It can't always be coaches because we aren't
always going to be out there on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Cole drew Shanahan's ire after running a route down the right
sideline. The ball sailed out of Cole's reach, and Shanahan
chastised him for failing to help quarterback Gus Frerotte.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've been explaining outside leverage for two weeks,'' the
coach yelled. ''Step out, step back inside. (Frerotte) doesn't have
all day.''
</P>
<P>
   John Avery later fumbled as he appeared to slow down during a
running drill, and Brian Griese and Frerotte each threw passes that
were either tipped at the line of scrimmage or intercepted.
</P>
<P>
   ''I really don't have much comment on it, to be honest with
you,'' Griese said of the quality of practice. ''We'll take care of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his disappointment, Shanahan did not punish his players
by altering the practice schedule. Several Broncos received the
afternoon off while others took part in a 45-minute special-teams
practice.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a challenge out here,'' cornerback Terrell Buckley said.
''The toughest thing for anybody is to beat a guy every day, day in
and day out. As a vet, you try to find ways to combat that.''
Ravens:
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver Travis Taylor, the 10th pick in the NFL draft,
agreed in principle to a five-year, $10.9 million contract.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, the second of the Ravens' two first-round picks, is
expected to report to training camp Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   A standout at the University of Florida, Taylor will sign a
contract that includes a guaranteed $5 million signing bonus.
According to Taylor's agent, Steve Weinberg, the bonus is 33
percent higher than that received by Baltimore cornerback Chris
McAlister, last year's No. 10 overall pick.
Chargers:
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Ryan Leaf had a setback with his surgically repaired
throwing shoulder Tuesday and is questionable for Saturday's
preseason opener at San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Leaf, who said his right shoulder was sore when he woke up in
the morning, threw briefly during Tuesday's practice, but spent
much of the session with an icebag draped around it.
</P>
<P>
   If Leaf can't throw Wednesday, his chances of playing Saturday
drop considerably.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can't count on him playing in the game because we don't
know even if he's going to practice every day,'' Chargers coach
Mike Riley said. ''We're up in the air at best on that right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaf hasn't played in a competitive NFL game in 19 months. He
tore the labrum in the shoulder a year ago and was looking forward
to getting back on the field.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's frustrating -- that's probably the best word to put it as
-- but there's nothing I can do about it,'' Leaf said. ''It's
something I can't control. When it's ready, it's going to be ready.
Two surgeries within a year takes its toll, especially on something
you make your livelihood at.''
Giants:
</P>
<P>
   Pro Bowl defensive end Michael Strahan continued to miss
practice because of a back problem, and it seems unlikely that he
will play in the exhibition opener Saturday against the Chicago
Bears.
</P>
<P>
   Strahan went to a local chiropractor Tuesday for treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Starting defensive tackle Keith Hamilton slightly pulled his
left hamstring in the afternoon workout.
</P>
<P>
   Guard Scott Kiernan continues to have problems with his ankle.
He sprained it last week and returned to practice Monday, but was
on the sidelines again Tuesday.
Patriots:
</P>
<P>
   Rookie free agents Tony Ortiz and Noel Scarlett were waived on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Scarlett, 26, 6-foot-3 and 320 pounds, was claimed off waivers
from the Minnesota Vikings in December. The defensive tackle then
played in NFL Europe for the Scottish Claymores.
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz, 23, a 6-foot, 225-pound linebacker and special-teams
performer, was claimed off waivers from the Dallas Cowboys on July
14.

<HEADLINE> NBA Roundup  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS SHERIDAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some day of player movement, huh? Everyone was expecting Grant
Hill, Tracy McGrady and Tim Duncan, and all they got was Ron
Mercer, Tony Delk and Bobby Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   While some teams took their time finalizing their free-agent
acquisitions, the Bulls, Suns and Kings got right down to business.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago found a player willing to take its money, signing
Mercer. Phoenix signed a player away from Sacramento, getting Delk
with a six-year, $19 million contract, while the Kings immediately
replenished their backcourt by agreeing to terms with Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami Heat and Charlotte Hornets finalized their nine-player
trade, and several teams re-signed their own free agents.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Thomas stays with Milwaukee, Kurt Thomas re-signed with New
York, Anthony Carter re-signed with the Heat, Sam Perkins re-signed
with Indiana, Scot Pollard stayed with the Kings, Dallas re-signed
Hubert Davis and Gary Trent, Denver kept Tariq Abdul-Wahad and John
Starks said he was ready to sign with Utah for two years.
</P>
<P>
   The pace of activity on the trade and free-agent fronts is
expected to stay steady over the next couple of days. The team
making the biggest splash, the Orlando Magic, is expected to
formally announce the signings of Hill and McGrady on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami-Charlotte trade sends All-Star guard Eddie Jones and
forward Anthony Mason to Miami for forward P.J. Brown and guard
Jamal Mashburn. Also traded were Otis Thorpe, Tim James and Rodney
Buford to Charlotte, and Ricky Davis and Dale Ellis to Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte avoided losing Jones without compensation by signing
him to a seven-year deal worth at least $86 million, then trading
him. He considered a free-agent offer from Chicago, but preferred
to play in South Florida, where he grew up and has a home.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Pat Riley kept his backup point guard, Carter, by
re-signing him to a one-year, $1.2 million exception. But Riley
decided to dismantle the core of a Heat team that has won four
consecutive Atlantic Division titles, only to flop each year in the
postseason.
</P>
<P>
   The Indiana Pacers have apparently managed to keep their team
intact, reportedly agreeing with free-agent forward Austin Croshere
on a seven-year, $51 million deal. Croshere was being pursued by
the Toronto Raptors, whose best offer was in the range of six years
and $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   ''We really want Austin to stay here. And Austin's been truly
fantastic in making it clear that he prefers to stay here because
of the franchise and the city.'' said David Morway, Pacers vice
president for basketball administration.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Perkins, Indiana is also expected to re-sign fellow free
agents Jalen Rose, Reggie Miller and Mark Jackson. If center Rik
Smits decides against retiring, he also is expected back with
Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-7 Mercer, who agreed to terms with Chicago, will be
with his fourth NBA team in four seasons. He played his first two
years with the Boston Celtics, was traded to Denver and then dealt
to Orlando last season, averaging 16.9 points.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls also met Tuesday with free-agent center Brad Miller,
but general manager Jerry Krause was unable to obtain any of the
big names he hoped to lure with nearly $20 million of salary cap
room.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas' new contract will pay him just under $67 million for six
years.
</P>
<P>
   That's a slightly bigger offer than the seven-year, $63 million
contract Milwaukee proposed in June -- and a significantly bigger
deal than the four-year, $24 million contract Thomas turned down
last October in order to test the free-agent waters this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Starks, an 11-year veteran who played eight seasons with the
Knicks, recently visited Utah and was wooed by Karl Malone, coach
Jerry Sloan and owner Larry Miller.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were very sincere that they wanted me, and I'm their guy
to fill the role that Jeff Hornacek played over the years,'' Starks
said. ''They were the first team that came at me with that type of
scenario.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson joins the Kings after averaging 5.1 points and 2.4
assists in 73 games last season as the primary backup to Terrell
Brandon. He reportedly gets a five-year deal with $13.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Delk, a four-year veteran who has also played for Charlotte and
Golden State, agreed to a six-year deal with Phoenix worth almost
$19 million.

<HEADLINE> NBA Approves Hornets-Heat Deal  </HEADLINE>
By STEVEN WINE
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- As four new players join the Miami Heat, coach Pat
Riley's biggest challenge might be keeping forward Anthony Mason
out of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   A nine-player deal with the Charlotte Hornets sent Mason to
Miami, where trendy South Beach and his penchant for problems are a
dangerous combination.
</P>
<P>
   ''It has occurred to me,'' admitted Mason's agent, Don Cronson.
''It's not like I'm worrying, 'Oh my gosh, South Beach.' But it's
there like a beacon, and I think he's going to be on his guard.''
</P>
<P>
   Mason was one of four starters involved in the largest trade in
Heat history. He and three-time All-Star guard Eddie Jones are
going to Miami for forward P.J. Brown and guard Jamal Mashburn.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is one of the most difficult things I have ever had to
do,'' Riley said. ''Trading P.J. Brown and Jamal Mashburn, two guys
who have been crucial to our success, was very unappealing and is
the tough part of this business. However, change was in order.''
</P>
<P>
   Confirmation of the trade was delayed until late Tuesday
afternoon, the first day of the free-agent signing period, while
the NBA made sure the deal met salary cap requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Also traded were Otis Thorpe, Tim James and Rodney Buford to
Charlotte, and Ricky Davis and 16-year veteran Dale Ellis to Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Riley and Mason had a turbulent relationship when both were with
the New York Knicks from 1991-95.
</P>
<P>
   Mason, 33, was suspended twice while he played for Riley and has
been arrested four times while with the Hornets, most recently when
he was charged with battery on a police officer, inciting a riot
and resisting arrest in New Orleans' French Quarter last month.
</P>
<P>
   ''Anthony over the course of time has learned a lot about
himself,'' Cronson said.
</P>
<P>
   The same is true of the Heat, who have won four consecutive
Atlantic Division titles. But in the past three seasons, they've
won only one playoff series and been eliminated by the archrival
New York Knicks each time.
</P>
<P>
   ''We began this process four years ago and are now ready to take
off to another level,'' Riley said. ''Sometimes change has to take
place in order to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   There has long been talk of the Heat's need to upgrade at
shooting guard. In past offseasons, Riley courted Latrell Sprewell,
Mitch Richmond and Larry Hughes, with Brown and Mashburn often
mentioned as trade bait. But until this week, Riley was unwilling
to pull the trigger.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who averaged a career-high 20.1 points and started in the
NBA All-Star Game last season, got the team and the contract he
wanted -- a seven-year deal for at least $86 million. He considered
a free-agent offer from the Chicago Bulls, but preferred to play in
South Florida, where he grew up and has a home.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's feeling great. It's a dream realized,'' said his agent,
Leon Rose. ''He's just excited about the chance to win a
championship.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones, 28, joins two other established stars, center Alonzo
Mourning and point guard Tim Hardaway. His new teammates also
include backup point guard Anthony Carter, who accepted a one-year,
$1.2 million exception Tuesday to re-sign with the Heat.
</P>
<P>
   ''I always knew I wanted to be here, and whatever it took for me
to sign, that's what I was going to do,'' said Carter, a rookie
last season. ''I'm going to do all I can to win a championship
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte avoided losing Jones without compensation by signing
him to the seven-year contract, then trading him. They acquired
five players, including the hardworking Brown, 30, whom Riley
traded reluctantly.
</P>
<P>
   ''I coached P.J. for three seasons in New Jersey, and I love his
unselfish, defensive style of play,'' Hornets coach Paul Silas
said. ''Jamal will give us a consistent scorer, with a
long-distance threat, that will complement our front-line
players.''

<HEADLINE> FDA Approves ADHD Drug  </HEADLINE>
By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Waiting at the school nurse's office or
interrupting soccer practice to take their medicine may soon be a
thing of the past for youngsters with attention deficit disorder.
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday approved Concerta, a
form of the most common drug used for the at disorder that can be
taken in the morning and lasts 12 hours.
</P>
<P>
   The National Attention Deficit Disorder Association says 4
percent to 6 percent of Americans have the condition clinically
known as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. They include
adults; the association estimates that at least half the ADHD
children show symptoms into adulthood.
</P>
<P>
   Currently between 4 percent and 12 percent of school-age
children -- an average of about 2.5 million, mostly boys -- are
thought to have ADHD. Symptoms include short attention span,
impulsive behavior and difficulty focusing and sitting still.
</P>
<P>
   Methylphenidate -- best known under the name Ritalin -- often is
prescribed to increase a child's alertness.
</P>
<P>
   But current forms of the drug require two or three doses daily,
often requiring youngsters to break up their schooldays with visits
to the nurse's office.
</P>
<P>
   The new drug lasts 12 hours, which will avoid in-school and
after-school dosing.
</P>
<P>
   Concerta was developed by Crescendo Pharmaceuticals Corp. and
will be manufactured and marketed by ALZA Corp. of Mountain View,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The new form of the drug will eliminate the stigma of taking a
drug in school and the problems of getting it to the school nurse
or interrupting after-school programs or practice, said Dan
Swisher, vice president of ALZA.
</P>
<P>
   ''It makes the condition private. It eliminates the
embarrassment for children,'' he said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   Swisher said McNeill Consumer Healthcare is assisting in the
marketing of Concerta, which should be available in two weeks. He
said the price has not been determined but will be comparable to
other ADHD treatments.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, people suffering from ADHD have problems following
instructions and paying attention. They may seem not to listen; be
disorganized; miss details; have trouble starting tasks, or
performing tasks that require planning or long-term effort; appear
to be easily distracted or forgetful. In many cases they seem
''hyper,'' being fidgety, impulsive and unable to wait their turn.
</P>
<P>
   Not all people with the disorder exhibit all the symptoms all
the time.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the symptoms also are associated with youthful
rambunctiousness, which has raised questions whether today's
youngsters are being overdiagnosed and overdrugged.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the American Academy of Pediatrics issued in May
its first guidelines for ADHD, hoping to eliminate incorrect
diagnoses and ensure untreated children get the help they need.
</P>
<P>
   The guidelines are for children 6 through 12. Most ADHD research
has involved that age group.
</P>
<P>
   Concerta is an extended-release formula in tablet form designed
to be taken in the morning before a child leaves for school.
</P>
<P>
   In clinical trials the most common side effects were headaches,
reported by 14 percent of patients. Less common were upper
respiratory tract infection and stomachache.

<HEADLINE> Tax Cuts Sharing Convention Stage  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- ''Render unto Caesar, but let the people
keep their own.''
</P>
<P>
   These words, on page five of the Republican national platform,
reflect how central tax cuts have always been to the party's
agenda. But in the GOP's drive to broaden its appeal, tax relief's
place in the spotlight at the Republican National Convention is
being crowded out by other priorities such as improving education
and attracting minority voters.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a different pitch now,'' said former Rep. Bob Livingston
of Louisiana. ''The same principles, but a different pitch. It's
not as shrill.''
</P>
<P>
   Little was said from the podium about tax cuts during the
convention's first two days, despite the rush by Republicans in
Congress to pass bills beforehand to eliminate the tax penalty on
marriage, repeal inheritance taxes and cut taxes on Social Security
benefits. All these have drawn veto threats from President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats say the relative silence is part of a GOP effort to
avoid frightening people concerned that deep tax cuts could eat up
a projected budget surplus before it even arrives in Washington,
siphoning off money for crucial government programs while mainly
helping the wealthiest Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ''They don't want to say anything at all,'' said Joe Andrews,
chairman of the Democratic National Committee. ''America rightly
sees the Democrats as the party of fiscal discipline.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Republicans will continue to deliver a tax-cutting
message, but in a soft-focus way: Wednesday night, a single mom, a
computer company president and a family farmer will join Virginia
Gov. Jim Gilmore in helping describe the GOP's tax relief vision.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have to pair education and taxes. It's important to
recognize that education is the key,'' Gilmore said in an
interview. ''But it is important to make the point that tax cuts
really relate to people.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilmore said the Democratic charges of draining the surplus is
''the old way of the old Democrats. They try to set one priority
against the other and force you to make decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, nominee-in-waiting George W. Bush has proposed major tax
cuts that would total roughly $1 trillion over the next decade and
they are a staple of most Republican congressional campaigns.
Although cutting taxes may not play as well for a national
election, the issue still energizes the GOP base and could be a
deciding factor in some districts.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've been overtaxed for two or three years,'' said Mike
Weber, a delegate from Reno, Nev. ''There are whole piles of money
and the first thing the Democrats want to do with it is spend it.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the only GOP political figures to dwell at length on tax
cuts during the first two days of the convention were the 29
congressional candidates who spoke during Monday's little-noticed
afternoon session.
</P>
<P>
   ''When George W. Bush is in the White House the American people
will have the tax relief they deserve,'' said Sen. Rod Grams of
Minnesota, who is seeking re-election.
</P>
<P>
   With the budget surplus so large, Vice President Al Gore is also
proposing tax cuts, but they would apply only to people with middle
incomes and are intended to help with specific things such as child
care and the costs of caring for elderly parents.
</P>
<P>
   To Republicans, this tack is a Democratic attempt to use the tax
code to redistribute income from the rich to the poor without
advocating creation of costly new government programs.
</P>
<P>
   ''They want to use if for social engineering. They want to
cajole you,'' said House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas. ''We
don't pick winners and losers in the tax code. ''
</P>
<P>
   Armey and Rep. Billy Tauzin, R-La., have been traveling the
country holding mock ''debates'' to push for scrapping the tax code
and replacing it with either a flat income or sales tax. They held
the 38th of these debates Tuesday night in an auditorium outside
the convention hall, with an audience of young GOP volunteers and
little media attention.

<HEADLINE> Going Upbeat Has a Price  </HEADLINE>
By CALVIN WOODWARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- They didn't ask. He didn't tell. And hardly
anyone listened.
</P>
<P>
   Pity the second-tier speakers at the Republican National
Convention. Even openly gay Republican Arizona Rep. Jim Kolbe,
speaking to a party with an anti-gay rights platform and some
delegates who didn't want him there, couldn't keep the crowd's
attention with his talk about trade.
</P>
<P>
   In a convention thin by design on attacks against Democrat Al
Gore, firing up the troops is proving a challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Headliners Tuesday night such as Sen. John McCain and Bob and
Elizabeth Dole went over moderately well, but the audience only
really came to life for the music and when a video was shown of
Ronald Reagan, one of three ex-presidents honored.
</P>
<P>
   Others gamely plugged along.
</P>
<P>
   Theodore Roosevelt IV, great-grandson of one of the party's
favorite presidents, a leader regarded as father of the national
parks, spoke about conservation and the ''senseless killing of
pelicans.''
</P>
<P>
   He told a long story in his few minutes about a Florida farmer
who persuaded President Roosevelt to help protect his pelican
breeding ground.
</P>
<P>
   ''The cry went out: 'Are you for pelicans or progress?''' the
great grandson said. ''As it turned out, the American people were
for pelicans.''
</P>
<P>
   There was much chattering and schmoozing and even a bit of
newspaper reading on the convention floor.
</P>
<P>
   Another speaker, Ave Marie Bie, head of the Wisconsin Public
Service Commission, complained about the lack of national energy
policy and won some applause when she said motorists are being
''Gored'' at the pump.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton is largely a target untouched in the
convention's main events so far, and Gore has been getting off
lightly, too. George W. Bush's campaign wants an upbeat tone.
</P>
<P>
   The party also wants to look inclusive, and by no accident made
Kolbe one of the few members of Congress who got to speak. He stuck
to trade, a signature issue for him.
</P>
<P>
   Several conservative delegates took off their cowboy hats and
bowed their heads in a silent prayer in the only visible sign of
protest. Instead, a Louisiana delegate buried his nose in a
tabloid, and the crowd offered the same inattention given to
others, too.

<HEADLINE> Albright Appeals to Yugo Opposition  </HEADLINE>
By ALEKSANDAR VASOVIC
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Despite an appeal by Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright, opponents of President Slobodan Milosevic
in Serbia and Montenegro are showing little sign that they will
challenge the Yugoslav strongman in September's national elections.
</P>
<P>
   Albright appealed to the opposition Tuesday not to go through
with their threatened boycott of the vote. She urged the democratic
opposition in Serbia and the pro-Western administration in sister
state Montenegro to unite behind a single candidate to oppose
Milosevic in the Sept. 24 election.
</P>
<P>
   Montenegrin and Serbian opposition groups meet Wednesday in
Montenegro's capital of Podgorica. But Miodrag Vukovic, a senior
adviser to Montenegro's president, said the talks were a ''pure
formality'' and would have ''no influence on our previously
publicly stated positions'' to boycott the balloting.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will not respect anything that derives from illegal and
unconstitutional acts,'' Vukovic told the private Montenegrin news
agency Montena-Fax. He said Montenegro would act ''as if there are
no elections at all.''
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear whether the largest Serbian opposition party, the
Serbian Renewal Movement of Vuk Draskovic, would take part in the
Podgorica meeting. On Tuesday, Draskovic's party repeated its
opposition to taking part in an election which critics claim will
not be free and fair.
</P>
<P>
   Without the Serbian Renewal Movement, the opposition front
stands little chance at the ballot box. Under Yugoslav law, winners
need on a plurality of votes cast without regard for the turnout.
</P>
<P>
   ''With such a regime, there should be no discussion about the
elections,'' said Ivan Kovacevic, Serbian Renewal Movement
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The party's leaders are to meet Sunday to determine their
strategy for the Sept. 24 elections, which includes balloting for
parliamentary and municipal posts, as well as for the president.
</P>
<P>
   The failure of the opposition to unite and rally behind a single
candidate has frustrated the Clinton administration, which had
hoped that Yugoslavia's defeat in last year's 78-day air war would
signal the end of the Milosevic regime.
</P>
<P>
   However, Milosevic has consistently outmaneuvered his domestic
opponents. He recently pushed through constitutional changes
enabling him to run again and reducing Montenegro's influence in
the union of two republics that make up Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   In Rome, Albright met with Montenegrin President Milo
Djukanovic, whose administration has received considerable U.S. and
Western European economic and political support. She said the
elections offer an opportunity to challenge Milosevic and his
opponents ''need to unite on a single candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   ''These elections clearly are important and will provide some
kind of a meaningful test,'' Albright said.
</P>
<P>
   Djukanovic declined to say if he had changed his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ''What I can say at this moment is that we will not put up with
the constitutional violence that Milosevic is trying to use against
Montenegro,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon: Kuwait a Free Country  </HEADLINE>
By PAULINE JELINEK
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Ten years after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait,
international efforts have kept Kuwait a free country and kept
Saddam Hussein from threatening other neighbors, according to the
Defense Department.
</P>
<P>
   But Pentagon officials say Iraq is still not living up to the
cease-fire agreement it signed at the end of the war to oust it
from Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago Wednesday, Iraqi President Saddam sent his troops
to conquer neighboring Kuwait and set in motion the events that led
to the 1991 Gulf War, won by a U.S.-led coalition, and to the
deployment of U.S. troops that continues today.
</P>
<P>
   ''Kuwait is free. It's rebuilt. It has a thriving economy,''
Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said Tuesday when asked what has
been accomplished by the decade-long effort. ''Iraq is contained.
It has a broken economy. It is an isolated state.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that's the fundamental ... accomplishment over the
last 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, State Department spokesman Philip Reeker again called
on Saddam to allow U.N. weapons inspectors to resume the monitoring
work they've been prevented from doing since 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our concerns about Saddam Hussein's desire to pursue a program
developing weapons of mass destruction, those concerns remain,''
Reeker said. ''We need to have inspectors on the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeker said Iraq must fulfill the disarmament conditions of the
cease-fire that ended the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   ''Iraq has failed to comply with its obligations under U.N.
Security Council resolutions, including failing to destroy, remove
or render harmless, under international supervision, its weapons of
mass destruction and long-range ballistic missiles,'' Reeker said.
</P>
<P>
   In response to reporters' questions at the regular Pentagon
briefing, Bacon admitted that Saddam remains in power and probably
has enriched himself while his people suffered under U.N.
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, ''I would question what joy one can derive from
being a strongman in a weak country, as Saddam Hussein is.'' He
later called the Iraqi leader ''an emperor in a ... weak,
dispirited country.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He's in a sense a captive in his country. He can't leave,''
said Bacon. ''He seems to move around regularly, in order to avoid
assassination or other attacks from forces that wish him ill.''
</P>
<P>
   Bacon said Saddam has been unable to rebuild his military partly
because the United States has helped contain him but largely
because the United Nations with its embargo has kept him from
buying more military equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is no longer a threat to his neighbors and is not seen as a
threat to his neighbors,'' Bacon said. ''That's largely because of
the containment that we have carried out.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to confirm that the cost of maintaining the no-fly zones
has been about $2 billion a year, Bacon said it is ''slightly less
than that, but it is certainly over a billion dollars a year.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States has a major deployment of about 24,000 troops
in the Gulf, including Army troops exercising in Kuwait, the Navy
in Bahrain and Air Force members stationed around the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon said warplanes have flown more than 200,000 sorties in a
southern Iraq no-fly zone since flights started in August 1992 and
16,000 in the North since a no-fly zone was established there in
1997. The flights are meant to prevent the use of Iraqi aircraft
against the country's minorities.

<HEADLINE> Toms River class action lawsuit names chemical, water companies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TOMS RIVER, N.J. (AP) - A second class-action lawsuit filed
against a chemical company many residents say exposed them to
polluted water and contaminated air also blames a local water
company for failing to protect the public water supply.
</P>
<P>
   Four attorneys who filed a class-action lawsuit earlier this
year claiming the former Ciba-Geigy Corp. contaminated Dover
Township's water filed the second lawsuit on behalf of more than
200 people.
</P>
<P>
   The latest lawsuit claims 201 people lost loved ones, suffered
emotional distress, or live in fear of contracting cancer because
Ciba was negligent in disposing of hazardous wastes from its dye
manufacturing operations.
</P>
<P>
   It also claims United Water Toms River, formerly known as Toms
River Water Co., failed to protect the purity of the public water
supply.
</P>
<P>
   The earlier class-action lawsuit, filed in May, did not name the
water company.
</P>
<P>
   Both lawsuits cite a Feb. 29 public health report that concluded
that residents may have been exposed to traces of dye and
nitrobenzene from Ciba-Geigy that seeped into three wells used by
the Toms River Water Co.
</P>
<P>
   Organic dyes, epoxy resins and specialty chemicals were
manufactured for nearly 40 years on the site, which was formerly
known as Toms River Chemical Co. Solid and liquid waste from the
manufacturing was dumped in 20 different places at the site,
contaminating soil and ground water.
</P>
<P>
   Declared a federal Superfund site in 1982, the land has come
under increased scrutiny since 1996, when the state revealed an
unusually high rate of some childhood cancers in the town.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1979 and 1995, 90 Dover Township children were diagnosed
with cancer, or about 23 more than researchers would have expected.
</P>
<P>
   The May lawsuit seeks payment from the company for medical
monitoring to detect potential health problems in people exposed to
polluted water.
</P>
<P>
   The second lawsuit also seeks the monitoring fund, adds the
water utility as a defendant, and seeks compensatory and punitive
damages for the 201 people, who include those who have lost family
members to cancer and other illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Spokespeople for both companies said officials there had not yet
seen the newest lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   United Water spokesman Richard Henning told the Asbury Park
Press of Neptune for Wednesday's editions that the company's water
''has met and continues to meet all the standards for safe drinking
water set by the state and federal governments.''
</P>
<P>
   Donna M. Jakubowski, a spokeswoman for Ciba Specialty Chemical
Corp., the successor to Ciba-Geigy, said the company intends to
defend its position that the company is not responsible for
people's illnesses.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Chief: Sierra Leone Dangerous  </HEADLINE>
By EDITH M. LEDERER
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan is
pressing for the peacekeeping force in Sierra Leone to be beefed
up, saying the war-torn nation, where the peacekeepers have tried
to take a more assertive role, remains ''dangerous and volatile.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States is balking at approving any extra troops to
strengthen the beleaguered U.N. mission in the West African nation,
which is nearing its ceiling of 13,000 troops.
</P>
<P>
   Annan in May recommended the addition of 3,500 more soldiers to
help the Sierra Leone government regain authority over territory
under control of the rebel Revolutionary United Front.
</P>
<P>
   In a report to the Security Council on Tuesday, the
secretary-general said he still believes the force needs to be
increased and plans to submit a new proposal in the near future. He
also recommended a six-month extension of the force's mandate,
which expires Aug. 7.
</P>
<P>
   He pointed to weaknesses that led to the force's biggest
embarrassment in Sierra Leone: Nearly 500 U.N. troops were taken
hostages by RUF rebels in May after they restarted the country's
9-year civil war.
</P>
<P>
   The peacekeepers lacked cohesion and a common understanding of
the force's purpose and rules of engagement, and some contingents
were not prepared to deal with the difficult environment and
logistical challenges, Annan said.
</P>
<P>
   There was also a lack of coordination between the military and
civilian sides of the U.N. mission and a lack of planning with U.N.
agencies and voluntary organizations operating in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   ''An important cause of these shortcoming was the fast growth of
the mission from a small team of military observers to a large
multidisciplinary peacekeeping operation,'' Annan said in the
report.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these problems have been addressed, and the U.N. force
launched a successful operation last month to free 222 Indian
peacekeepers and 11 military observers surrounded in their compound
by RUF rebels, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, ''durable peace'' remains a distant goal, he said.
A political solution must be ''based on a robust and credible
international military presence.''
</P>
<P>
   He painted a grim picture of the situation in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   RUF rebels shows ''no credible sign'' of resuming the peace
process, and civilians continue to suffer from the ongoing fighting
and human rights abuses including abductions, rape, looting and
forced recruitment of children, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Despite some improvements, the situation in Sierra Leone has
remained dangerous and volatile,'' Annan said.
</P>
<P>
   A two-day session the United Nations that ended Tuesday
addressed ways to put an end to the flow of illegal diamond sales
that have helped the RUF fund its war.
</P>
<P>
   The world body already has slapped an embargo on rebel diamonds.
But the United States and Britain said Monday that the presidents
of Liberia and Burkina Faso were helping the RUF sell diamonds to
buy weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The two West African countries demanded proof of the
allegations, but promised Tuesday to cooperate with investigations
and asked for aid to end the illegal trade in diamonds and arms in
their countries.
</P>
<P>
   Annan announced a five-member panel established by the Security
Council to investigate possible violations of the arms embargo.

<HEADLINE> Bullock, Bush Had Deep Friendship  </HEADLINE>
By CONNIE CASS
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Shortly before he was elected governor,
George W. Bush paid a courtesy call on Texas' most powerful -- and
ornery -- politician, Democratic Lt. Gov. Bob Bullock.
</P>
<P>
   As they sat around the kitchen table for three or four hours,
swapping stories and ideas, the untested candidate and the 40-year
political veteran began forging a remarkable, bipartisan
friendship.
</P>
<P>
   It was a bond so strong that, after Bullock's death, his widow
feels compelled to step into her husband's place and carry his
message about Bush to the Republican National Convention on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''If my husband was still alive, I feel quite certain he would
be here addressing this crowd,'' Mrs. Bullock said on her way into
the hall to watch Tuesday night's speeches. ''I've sort of felt him
in the last couple of weeks, guiding me.''
</P>
<P>
   Bullock died just over a year ago, at age 69, after battling
lung and heart disease for years. He had left the lieutenant
governor's job in January 1999 after eight years in office. At his
funeral, Bush remembered him as a man who ''embodied the Texas of
our myths and of our hearts.''
</P>
<P>
   And a few weeks ago, Bush asked Mrs. Bullock to speak in a place
of honor, a little over an hour before he accepts the GOP
presidential nomination. Her appearance will help Bush showcase his
theme of being above partisan politics.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Bullock, who owns an Austin dress shop, has served on state
boards and traveled with Texas first lady Laura Bush. Her speaking
experience is limited to local groups. She plans to tell the
national TV audience about a friendship that ''surprised a lot of
people.''
</P>
<P>
   ''My husband was very picky, and a perfectionist. He wasn't
impressed by anybody or anything,'' she said. ''He could always see
through people -- he called them counterfeits -- five miles away.''
</P>
<P>
   But he felt Bush was genuine, ''his heart in the right place.''
And he would note admiringly that the governor ''worked like a
dog,'' Mrs. Bullock said.
</P>
<P>
   Bullock's trust and cooperation were crucial to Bush. In Texas,
the lieutenant governor commands the Senate and wields great power
to block bills pushed by the constitutionally weak governor.
</P>
<P>
   The two worked closely on education, limiting lawsuits, the
juvenile justice system and other issues they held in common.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bob was so fond of him, he really loved him,'' said Mrs.
Bullock, 51, who considers herself a political independent.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Bullock endorsed Bush's re-election over fellow
Democrat Garry Mauro -- even though Bullock was godfather to one of
Mauro's daughters.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was pretty shocking. ... He definitely did get some
flack,'' Mrs. Bullock said. ''But I think Texans knew that Bob had
always been extremely independent and had done pretty much what he
wanted to do.''
</P>
<P>
   And Bullock was one of the first to publicly mention Bush's name
for the nation's highest office, saying in 1998: ''I would be proud
to call him president.''

<HEADLINE> Sculpture Squirt Gun Set To Vanish  </HEADLINE>
By DEBORAH BAKER
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) -- The boy and girl, slightly crouched, take
aim at one another. She has a hose. He brandishes a water pistol.
</P>
<P>
   For Linda Strong, it was an image that captured all the joy of
being young.
</P>
<P>
   When the sculptor was asked to create a fountain for a city
park, it was a natural: Using her children as models, she caught in
bronze their many water fights.
</P>
<P>
   That was 21 years ago. Today -- to some observers who have
watched gun violence escalate and children bleeding on school yards
-- the piece evokes something more sinister.
</P>
<P>
   So Strong is about to alter her sculpture in this art-savvy
city. She plans to chisel off the boy's hand Thursday and give him
a new one, holding a garden hose rather than a gun.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's the right thing to do,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, following the deaths of 14 students and a teacher at
Columbine High School in Colorado, there were letters to a local
newspaper and calls to City Hall objecting to the fountain.
</P>
<P>
   ''At first I didn't consider doing anything about it,'' said
Strong, sitting in her studio south of Santa Fe. ''I just went,
'Oh, listen to these people.'''
</P>
<P>
   But then her fountain was vandalized. The boy was smeared with
green paint, and someone wrote ''no gun'' on his legs. The artist
became intent on protecting her work.
</P>
<P>
   ''And so I capitulated. I thought, the times have changed,'' she
said. ''I am open-minded enough to change with the times.''
</P>
<P>
   Strong went to the city, and the Santa Fe Arts Commission
recommended the change.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't like revisionism in art, but I think art in public
places has another responsibility,'' said commission chairwoman
Letitia Frank.
</P>
<P>
   Strong, 58, is the first to admit that when no water is running
through the fountain -- frequently, during this summer's drought --
the boy's pistol doesn't look like a squirt gun.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want people to look at it and enjoy it. It's not being
enjoyed,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone agrees with the revision.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think there's anything wrong with it,'' said Diana
Beilman, 15, glancing over at the sculpture from a nearby
skateboard park. ''Little boys hold guns all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   A gift to the city from Strong's late mother, the fountain was
dedicated in October 1979, the International Year of the Child.
</P>
<P>
   There were objections even then. In a yellowed
letter-to-the-editor in one of Strong's scrapbooks, Charlene Neel
refers to a recent shooting over a traffic dispute, and writes that
there is ''quite enough (violence) on television and on the streets
of Santa Fe.''
</P>
<P>
   The writer -- now Charlene Neel Dye of Oxford, Miss. -- recalls
that at the time, she wouldn't allow her young son to play with
guns or war toys.
</P>
<P>
   When she saw the fountain, ''I was shocked. The little boy was
in such an aggressive stance, and he had a gun.'' She remembers
other friends sharing her concern.
</P>
<P>
   But Jack Samson, who moved to Santa Fe in 1930, blames
''self-appointed guardians of our morality'' for the planned
alteration.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is an effort to be politically correct, and I think it goes
over the bounds of common sense,'' said Samson, a former editor of
Field &AMP; Stream.
</P>
<P>
   The estimated cost of the alteration is about $1,700.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you look at public sentiment now in terms of guns and
youth, even though it's a squirt gun, most people in favor of
(altering) it feel that ... the message it's providing in its
imagery, is not appropriate in this day and age,'' said city
spokesman Juan Rios.
</P>
<P>
   Locals enjoying the park on a summer afternoon appeared to
agree.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the artist and her family are willing to change it, and it
will calm people, why not? We need more calm,'' Kerry Featheringill
said.

<HEADLINE> Former President Ford Hospitalized  </HEADLINE>
By JEN LIN-LIU
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Former President Gerald Ford was treated for
a sinus infection at a Philadelphia hospital after being honored
Tuesday night at the Republican National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   ''He felt uncomfortable,'' said Calvin McDowell, a Ford aide.
''That's what prompted him to come to the hospital.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford spent a little more than a half-hour at Hahnemann
University Hospital, according to Secret Service spokesman Mike
Connoly.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel good,'' the former president told reporters as he left
the hospital, accompanied by his wife.
</P>
<P>
   After getting into a waiting car, he rolled down the window,
pointed to his nose and said, ''It's a bad sinus infection.''
</P>
<P>
   Penny Circle, Ford's chief of staff, called it an acute sinus
attack. A doctor prescribed an antibiotic before he was released.
</P>
<P>
   ''It happened during the convention, during the time he was in
the presidential box,'' she said, adding that he did not have to
leave the convention hall early Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is flying home tomorrow so he wanted to have it checked
out,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ford, 87, was among three former presidents honored during the
second night of the convention.
</P>
<P>
   John Van Fossen, a legislative aide for U.S. Rep. Pete Hoekstra,
said the Michigan delegation was told that Ford was suffering from
bronchitis.
</P>
<P>
   Ford told CNN's Larry King, in an interview broadcast Tuesday
night, that he's ''looking forward'' to living longer.
</P>
<P>
   I couldn't be healthier,'' he said. ''Betty and I are having a
magnificent life: 52 years of married life, four great children, 15
grandchildren. Everything is breaking just right and I am delighted
to be here at this convention after going to so many for so many
years.''
</P>
<P>
   At Tuesday night's convention session, Ford was honored along
with former Republican Presidents George Bush and Ronald Reagan for
his role in the country's, and the GOP's, success.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, appearing on C-SPAN, he answered questions
from a variety of callers on everything from the U.S. policy on
Iran to whether President Clinton should be pardoned for any
charges he might face.
</P>
<P>
   Ford, frail but congenial, answered virtually all of the
questions with detail and acuity.
</P>
<P>
   Ford, the 38th and only unelected president in America's
history, took office minutes after Richard Nixon flew off into
exile and declared ''our long national nightmare is over.''
</P>
<P>
   But he revived the debate a month later by granting Nixon a
pardon for all crimes he committed as president. That single act,
it was widely believed, cost Ford election to a term of his own in
1976. He was in the White House only 895 days.
</P>
<P>
   Ford also earned a place in the history books as the first
unelected vice president, chosen by Nixon to replace Spiro Agnew
who also was forced from office by scandal.
</P>
<P>
   In a long congressional career in which he rose to be House
Republican leader, Ford lit few fires. In the words of
Congressional Quarterly, he ''built a reputation for being solid,
dependable and loyal - a man more comfortable carrying out the
programs of others than in initiating things on his own.''
</P>
<P>
   When Agnew resigned in a bribery scandal in October 1973, Ford
was one of four finalists to succeed him. Nixon picked Ford ,
saying he had known the congressman ''longer and better than any of
the rest.'' On Aug. 9, 1974, after seeing Nixon off to exile, Ford
assumed the office.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving the White House, he took up residence in the plush
resort area of Palm Springs, Calif., picked up $1 million for his
memoir and another $1 million in a five-year NBC television
contract, and served on a number of corporate boards. By 1987, he
was on eight such boards, at fees up to $30,000 a year, and was
consulting for others, at fees up to $100,000. After criticism, he
cut back on such activity.

<HEADLINE> Cheney Begins New Chapter in Life  </HEADLINE>
By JEANNINE AVERSA
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- A main architect of the U.S. military
victory over Iraq. A 10-year member of the House. A globe-trotting
executive for a giant oil-services company. Dick Cheney has led
many lives.
</P>
<P>
   His latest challenge: helping George W. Bush win the White House
and then serving as vice president, a voice of experience and top
adviser, just like he was as secretary of defense for Bush's father
when the nation went to war.
</P>
<P>
   GOP party watchers say Bush's choice of Cheney as his running
mate complements the Texas governor's energy and exuberance with
the quiet wisdom of a seasoned behind-the-scenes player in
business, foreign policy and national politics.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney will accept the Republican Party's nomination for vice
president Wednesday night and speak to a nationwide television
audience about his and Bush's vision for America's future.
</P>
<P>
   ''Cheney was a fairly public character during the Gulf War, but
Americans have a short memory. I think he'll be using part of the
speech to reintroduce himself to the public,'' said Richard Katula,
professor of communications at Northeastern University in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney wrote the speech himself. Aides were mum on the themes.
</P>
<P>
   Communications experts, however, said there will be as much
riding on how he says it as what he says.
</P>
<P>
   ''There has been a lot of talk that Cheney is dull and not
charismatic, raising questions about how good of a campaigner he is
going to be ... A rousing speech could change that perception,''
said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, dean of the Annenberg School for
Communication at the University of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Michel, former House minority leader, acknowledged that his
good friend is ''not one of the firebrand speakers. He is calm,
rational, deliberate.'' But, ''I think that would be very
reassuring to people.''
</P>
<P>
   Since being named to the GOP ticket last week, Democrats have
focused on his conservative voting record as a Wyoming congressman
in the late 1970s and '80s.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, 59, has spent the past week addressing some of those
votes: against bans on ''cop-killer'' bullets and plastic handguns,
and an embargo against South Africa aimed at freeing Nelson Mandela
and ending apartheid.
</P>
<P>
   ''I might find a couple (votes) I would do differently'' today,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Former President Gerald Ford, who plucked Cheney from relative
obscurity in 1975 by making him history's youngest White House
chief of staff at age 34, explained his former aide's congressional
record.
</P>
<P>
   ''I served 25 years in the House so I know that a member of the
House, to get re-elected, has to reflect the views of his
constituents,'' Ford said this week on CNN. ''And, Wyoming is a
conservative state ... Dick Cheney was following the mandates of
his own constituents and that is a very legitimate role for a
member of the House to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney offers no apologies for his virtually 100 percent voting
record against abortion rights -- a party principle that Republican
delegates here reaffirmed this week and an issue that solidifies
Cheney's and Bush's support from the party's conservative base.
</P>
<P>
   After flunking out of Yale in 1962, Cheney returned to Wyoming
and got his bachelor's and master's degrees while picking up four
Vietnam War-era student deferments, which Democrats also have
criticized.
</P>
<P>
   He renewed a relationship with high school sweetheart Lynne Anne
Vincent and they married in 1964. Four years later, politics lured
them to Washington, where Cheney became a protege of Illinois
Republican Rep. Donald Rumsfeld, a close friend of Ford.
</P>
<P>
   From there, his rise was meteoric. After Ford was defeated for
re-election, Cheney was elected to Congress in 1978 despite having
a heart attack in the middle of the campaign. It was the first of
three he would suffer; he had a quadruple bypass in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney earned a seat on the House Intelligence Committee and in
just six years rose through the ranks to become the GOP's whip, the
party's No. 2 position in the House.
</P>
<P>
   When George Bush became president in 1989, he persuaded Cheney
to become his defense secretary. Two years later, Cheney and Gen.
Colin Powell, the first black chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, masterminded a quick military defeat of Iraq's Saddam
Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   ''He gave the American public confidence that he knew what he
was doing,'' said Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss.
</P>
<P>
   Following Bill Clinton's defeat of the elder Bush in 1992,
Cheney left government for the world of business. He served on
several corporate boards and became chief executive of Halliburton
Corp., a leading oil-services company based in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   In April, the younger Bush put Cheney in charge of his vice
presidential search team. Three months later, Bush decided Cheney
was the man he was searching for all along.

<HEADLINE> Padres 10 Phillies 9, 10 Innings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Kevin Nicholson hit an RBI single with two outs
in the 10th inning as the San Diego Padres beat the Philadelphia
Phillies 10-9 Tuesday night after blowing an eight-run lead.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego led 9-1 after six innings before Philadelphia rallied.
The Phillies tied it in the ninth on two-out homers by Scott Rolen
and Pat Burrell off closer Trevor Hoffman, who blew his fifth save
since June 23.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres came back to win it in the 10th. Mike Darr led off
with a single off Jeff Brantley (1-5) and was forced out at second
on Ryan Klesko's grounder. Klesko stole second when Phil Nevin
struck out and then came home on Nicholson's single to right field.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Almanzar (2-3) pitched one perfect inning for the win.
also let a 5-0 lead in the first slip away.
</P>
<P>
   John Mabry, acquired Monday in the trade that sent Al Martin to
Seattle, hit a three-run homer in his first at-bat for San Diego to
cap a five-run first inning off Robert Person.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Darr hit a two-run shot earlier in the inning in his first
game since being recalled Monday from Triple-A Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Eaton allowed five runs -- four earned -- and seven hits with
seven strikeouts in 6 2-3 innings in his first start against his
former team. The Phillies dealt Eaton to San Diego last Nov. 10
with two other pitchers in exchange for Andy Ashby.
</P>
<P>
   Darr, who went 1-for-13 previously with the Padres this season,
followed a leadoff single by Eric Owens in the first with his first
homer of the season. Person then walked two batters before Mabry
hit a 409-foot drive just over the center-field fence.
</P>
<P>
   Mabry had one homer and seven RBIs with a .243 batting average
in 48 games for Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Owens went 3-for-6 and scored twice with a double and one RBI
for his third straight multihit game. Klesko went 3-for-5 with two
runs scored and an RBI.
</P>
<P>
   The Phillies rallied with five runs to close within 9-6 in the
seventh, including a two-run double by Bobby Abreu and a two-run
fielding error by Nicholson.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Hunter added a solo homer, his seventh of the season, in
the eighth off Donne Wall.
</P>
<P>
   Person gave up eight runs and eight hits in 5 2-3 innings in his
third start since recovering from a right shoulder strain.
</P>
<P>
   The Phillies scored in the second, when Travis Lee doubled and
eventually came home on Desi Relaford's sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres, who won their third straight, matched their best
winning streak since June 16-18.
</P>
<P>
Notes: With the addition of Mabry and pitcher Heathcliff Slocumb,
the Padres have had 48 players in the lineup this season, tying the
club record set in 1991. ... RHP Paul Byrd of the Phillies will
undergo surgery on his right shoulder to repair a labral tear on
Wednesday. ... Of his 12 starts, Eaton has left the game just twice
with the Padres trailing.

<HEADLINE> 67 Killed in Kashmir Attacks  </HEADLINE>
By QAISER MIRZA
<TEXT>
<P>
   PAHALGAM, India (AP) -- Six massacres by suspected Islamic
guerrillas opposed to a cease-fire have killed 76 people within a
few hours in the disputed territory of Kashmir, police said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The attacks came as the Indian federal government prepared to
talk to the main guerrilla group in Kashmir, where more than 25,000
people have died during an 11-year Islamic insurgency.
</P>
<P>
   Gunmen killed 12 people in the Hindu-dominated village of Pogal
on Wednesday morning, said Police Inspector-General S.P. Vaid in
Jammu, the state's winter capital 108 miles to the north. He said
the militants first killed two Hindus in the adjoining village of
Danvata
</P>
<P>
   In Kalaroos, 60 miles north of Srinagar, the summer capital,
armed men killed five family members in the home of a member of a
civilian unit which the state armed and trained to fight militants.
</P>
<P>
   There were three attacks Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Attackers swooped on the Mir Bazar village near Anantnag,
forcing people out of their homes, then lining up men and shooting
them dead, said police in Srinagar, 25 miles to the north. Eighteen
people were killed, the Press Trust of India reported. Those killed
were workers at a brick factory who had migrated from other Indian
states, police said.
</P>
<P>
   In Achchabal, about nine miles from Anantnag, militants stormed
into houses and killed seven migrant laborers, said Vaid.
</P>
<P>
   Hours earlier, 32 unarmed Hindu pilgrims and Muslims porters
were killed as the group made its way to a religious shrine in the
Muslim-majority state. Forty-one people were injured, police and
hospital officials said. Soldiers fired back, killing the
militants, police said.
</P>
<P>
   No one immediately claimed responsibility for the first attack
in Pahalgam, 55 miles south of Srinagar, or the others. But police
suspected Islamic guerrillas who oppose a Kashmir cease-fire and
seek the region's independence. It also wasn't known if the
violence was the work of a single group as more than a dozen rebel
bands are waging insurgencies.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's an attempt to sabotage the peace process,'' Chief
Minister Farooq Abdullah, the highest elected official in Kashmir,
said following the earlier attack. He said the militants were
trying to create confusion at a time when ''a silver lining has
started to appear in the dark clouds of violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Abdullah and the federal government have been trying to
negotiate with guerrilla groups, notably the Hezb-ul-Mujahedeen
outfit, which announced a unilateral cease-fire Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds of Kashmir is controlled by India and the rest by
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   The Indian state's chief minister, Farooq Abdullah, said 11
pilgrims were killed in the Pahalgam attack. The others were
security force troops, porters and businessmen, Press Trust quoted
him as saying.
</P>
<P>
   At least eight gunmen attacked a makeshift shack near the Ardoo
Bridge on the outskirts of the town when the pilgrims were eating
dinner. Two militants stormed into the kitchen and opened fire, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
   Police suspected Islamic guerrillas fighting for Kashmir's
independence from India. But some witnesses said that many were
killed in the 20-minute crossfire by the soldiers. Others alleged
the attackers were not militants, but Kashmiri police trying to
blame militants.
</P>
<P>
   Bus driver Balbir Singh, who had brought pilgrims to Pahalgam,
told The Associated Press. ''I saw two men in a Kashmir police
uniform who started firing from a bridge and on the bus. I saw two
Hindu priests killed before me, and two other men.''
</P>
<P>
   Shops were looted in the aftermath and people wandered around
wailing as they searched for relatives and friends.
</P>
<P>
   The pilgrims had been walking to Amarnath Cave, a religious site
for Hindus in the mountains that takes two days to reach. Some
20,000 pilgrims are camping in tents and hotels in Pahalgam, where
they begin a 30-mile trek into the mountains.

<HEADLINE> Fox Seeks End of U.S. Certification  </HEADLINE>
By ELOY O. AGUILAR
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Mexico's president-elect will ask for an end
to the unilateral U.S. certification of Latin American countries'
anti-drug efforts when he meets with President Clinton, aides said.
</P>
<P>
   The certification program has long been criticized as a symbol
of U.S. domination. Countries that refuse to participate risk
losing trade benefits and possible access to international loans.
</P>
<P>
   Aguilar Zinser, a foreign relations adviser to President-elect
Vicente Fox, said the United States should join an ''international
process'' that would allow the formation of a regional
anti-narcotics group made up of countries fighting the drug trade.
</P>
<P>
   Another proposal Fox planned to bring to Clinton during their
Aug. 24 meeting at the White House was creating a ''border czar''
who would direct a Mexican agency coordinating federal and state
forces and who would work with the United States on border issues.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, who will be formally certified as Mexico's president-elect
on Wednesday, also plans to meet with Democratic presidential
candidate Al Gore and Republican George W. Bush during meetings in
Washington and Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   He will present his ''future vision for a profound relationship
with the partners in the North American Free Trade Agreement,''
said Jorge Castaneda, a Fox foreign relations adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Fox has said he would like to expand the trade bloc into a
common market allowing the free movement of workers between borders
-- an idea likely to meet opposition in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   On July 2, Fox became the first opposition presidential
candidate to defeat a member of Mexico's ruling Institutional
Revolutionary Party, or PRI, which has been in power since 1929.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's pro-business stance, and the close ties between the PRI
and Mexico's largest unions, had led to concerns about possible
labor unrest when he takes office Dec. 1. Fox met Tuesday with
labor leaders in an attempt to head off any such disputes.
</P>
<P>
   Leonardo Rodriguez Alcaine of the pro-government Mexican Workers
Confederation said afterward that Fox promised to respect unions
and work rules, and the two had found ''some common ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez Alcaine had said before the elections that he would
call a general strike if Fox won; he later backed off that threat
and claimed he had been misinterpreted.
</P>
<P>
   Fox held a somewhat warmer meeting with leaders of the smaller,
independent National Workers Union, despite their opposition to his
proposal to apply sales taxes to food and medicines.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, dissident PRI members called Tuesday for President
Ernesto Zedillo to be expelled after he presided over the party's
first presidential loss in 71 years. Zedillo's grip weakened
further Tuesday when the man he had reportedly supported to take
over the PRI's top post -- Jesus Murillo Karam -- announced he would
leave the party leadership.

<HEADLINE> Convention Protesters Disrupt City  </HEADLINE>
By CHRISTOPHER NEWTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- After a day marked by angry brawls with
police, protesters licked their wounds and began drawing up plans
to disrupt traffic for the remaining two days of the Republican
National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   Police Commissioner John Timoney was slightly injured Tuesday in
clashes between police and protesters.
</P>
<P>
   Some protesters acknowledged that they baited police into
fighting and will continue to do so. Police said 280 people were
arrested throughout the city Tuesday, most for misdemeanors, but 10
were charged for assaulting police.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will continue to put our bodies on the line to show how
police resort to violence even when they do not need to,'' said
17-year-old activist Jesse Wilson, as hundreds of protesters
regrouped Tuesday night after being chased through the streets by
dozens of police. ''They could arrest people peacefully for
painting on cop cars, but this is an authoritarian state, so they
feel the need to beat us. This is what we want to show the American
people.''
</P>
<P>
   The clashes came after three days of mostly peaceful protests.
Protesters had promised a day of disruptions Tuesday over such
causes as opposition to the death penalty and police brutality.
</P>
<P>
   Fights broke out and the commissioner was slightly injured when
nearly 100 protesters dressed in black clothes and wearing masks
began defacing police vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Timoney noted that many of the troublemakers matched the
appearance of masked anarchists who wear black and were blamed for
extensive property damage in Seattle during the World Trade
Organization meeting last fall. Several of Tuesday's protesters
identified themselves as ''black bloc'' anarchists, who have had a
large presence in Internet discussion groups planning for the
convention.
</P>
<P>
   ''These people were here to cause problems, not protest or talk
about issues,'' Timoney said, referring to a group of
self-proclaimed anarchists. ''We will be watching for them the rest
of the week. They are here to endanger property and assault
officers and that is what they did.''
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, a bus full of thousands of caged lizards and small
animals was pulled over in what police say may have been part of an
elaborate plan to release animals during a protest. Two men were
arrested and are to be charged with cruelty to animals.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia Zoo officials accepted the animals, which included
about 2,000 iguanas, a dead skunk, white mice, about 20 exotic
snakes, crickets, desert toads and lizards.
</P>
<P>
   Some protesters were upset about the masked group's behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ''If it gets like this again, I'm going home,'' said Patricia
Maxey, a 16-year-old member of New Yorkers Against the Death
Penalty. ''I don't want to be beaten up because some idiot in a
mask wants to get on television. I came here to talk about
injustice.''
</P>
<P>
   The protests seemed to cause only minor problems for
convention-goers. A number of state delegations were late, but the
program began as scheduled. Most protests were far from the First
Union Center arena where the gathering is being held.
</P>
<P>
   At least six officers were treated and released from area
hospitals, medical and police officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters slashed tires on police vehicles, dumped orange paint
on some and spray-painted obscenities on others. Graffiti
denouncing the death penalty and police also was sprayed on City
Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Police responded with batons after being hit by protesters.
</P>
<P>
   Several protesters were left bleeding after being struck in the
head and chest with batons. Police could not immediately confirm
whether any of those in custody were injured.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, about 100 police officers on bicycles stormed into
the area with the most violent activity and herded protesters back
into a small grassy area.
</P>
<P>
   The violence prompted police to re-evaluate their tactics.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wonder if our trying to be patient and calm may have been
interpreted as a sign of weakness,'' said Robert Mitchell, the
deputy police commissioner. ''We didn't intend it to be taken that
way, we honestly thought violence could be avoided. But apparently
that was never the intention of some people out here today.''

<HEADLINE> Dow Gains 27 As Nasdaq Slips 17  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks opened mixed Wednesday as benign economic
indicators were offset by concerns for second-quarter earnings,
leaving investors with no clear direction.
</P>
<P>
   In early trading, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 27.20
at 10,634.15.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index fell 17.24 to 3,668.28. The Standard
&AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 0.27 at 1,438.37.
</P>
<P>
   There was little news on which to trade Wednesday. Consequently
investors resorted to Tuesday's pattern, in which blue-chip stocks
moved higher on encouraging economic news and the technology heavy
Nasdaq stock market fell on concerns that earnings will slump in
the second half of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, three reports indicated that the economy is slowing
down and that the Federal Reserve Board's strategy of raising
interest rates may be working. If so, the Fed may leave rates
stable at their next meeting Aug. 22, which would benefit the
interest rate sensitive Dow Jones industrial average.
</P>
<P>
   In the first report, the National Association of Purchasing
Management said activity in the nation's industrial sector was
unchanged in July. Analysts had expected a small increase.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Commerce Department reported construction
spending fell 1.7 percent in June. Again, analysts had forecast a
small increase in that figure.
</P>
<P>
   A third report found stronger-than-expected consumer spending
during June, and that the gain outstripped American workers' income
gains. But investors looked past that sign of economic strength
because the Commerce Department report also found that the prices
Americans pay for goods overall were unchanged.

<HEADLINE> Dow Up 72 in Early Trading  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks moved higher Wednesday as more
encouraging economic news sent blue-chip stocks higher.
</P>
<P>
   In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones
industrial average was up 72.53 at 10,679.48.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index was up 6.15 at 1,444.25 and the Nasdaq composite index
was up 39.40 at 3,724.92.
</P>
<P>
   Blue-chip stock prices surged early in the session after the
U.S. Conference Board reported that its leading economic indicators
were unchanged in June.
</P>
<P>
   Investors took that as a sign that the economy may be slowing
down in response to the Federal Reserve Board's strategy of raising
interest rates during the past year.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, three other reports indicated that the economy is
slowing down. If so, the Fed may leave rates stable at their next
meeting Aug. 22, which would benefit the interest rate sensitive
Dow Jones industrial stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues were about even with decliners on the New York
Stock Exchange, where volume came to 126.72 million shares.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was down 1.11 at 496.68.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.66 percent. In
afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was down 0.43 percent,
Britain's FT-SE 100 was up 0.23 percent, and France's CAC-40 was
down 0.29 percent.

<HEADLINE> Blair Agrees to Vacation Photo-Op  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Prime Minister Tony Blair has agreed to line up
his family for photos when they start their vacation in Tuscany on
Saturday, backing down from a ''no cameras'' policy declared after
a fuss over his baby son's baptism.
</P>
<P>
   Blair's office said Wednesday that the time and the place for
the photo had not yet been set.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently annoyed that newspapers had published pictures of
Blair and baby son Leo despite the prime minister's appeal for
photographers to stay away from last weekend's baptism, Blair's
office said the family would not pose for photographs in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Blair and his wife Cherie relented after Lord Wakeham, chairman
of the Press Complaints Commission, suggested it might be best for
both sides to agree on a single photo opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Wakeham said he hoped that after the photo session, ''the family
will be able to complete its holiday in private.''
</P>
<P>
   Blair's chief spokesman, Alastair Campbell, said the prime
minister and his wife accept that there is a public interest in the
family.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a difficult area, in that the prime minister and Mrs.
Blair wish their children to enjoy as normal an upbringing as
possible and to be able to grow up without the constant glare of
the media spotlight,'' Campbell said.

<HEADLINE> Montenegro Stands By Voting Boycott  </HEADLINE>
By ALEN MLATISUMA
<TEXT>
<P>
   PODGORICA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Montenegro, Serbia's junior partner
in the Yugoslav federation, refused pleas Wednesday to reconsider
its decision to boycott next month's Yugoslav national elections.
</P>
<P>
   Serbian opposition leaders pleaded with Montenegrin officials at
a meeting here to drop the boycott idea and join the opposition at
the polls to confront President Slobodan Milosevic in a united
bloc.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting came a day after Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright met Montenegrin President Milo Djukanovic in Rome to try
to convince him to participate. Otherwise, U.S. officials fear,
Milosevic will win easily.
</P>
<P>
   But officials from Montenegro reiterated their stand Wednesday,
saying they will not take part in the Sept. 24 balloting for a
Yugoslav president, parliament and local officials.
</P>
<P>
   ''We told our Serb colleagues our principled stand not to take
part in the elections,'' said Miodrag Vukovic, a top Djukanovic
adviser. He added that ''in the coming period, we'll do everything
to help the Serbian opposition unseat the Belgrade dictator,'' but
he gave no details.
</P>
<P>
   The representatives of 15 Serbian opposition parties flew to
Montenegro's capital for the meeting Wednesday. But in a sign of
the disunity plaguing Milosevic's opponents, the delegation
contained no one from Serbia's largest opposition party, the
Serbian Renewal Movement, which is also boycotting the election.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, many leading opposition figures believe this
election offers the best hope for bringing down the Milosevic
government.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think the only right option is taking part in the
elections,'' said Zoran Djindjic, the head of Serbian Democratic
Party. ''No analysis we've done so far showed a boycott would bring
a positive result either for us in Serbia, or for Montenegro.''
</P>
<P>
   The main topic during Wednesday's meeting here was the
parliamentary contest, in which 50 seats reserved for Montenegro
are at stake. If the Montenegrin government boycotts, the seats
would go to Milosevic's supporters in Montenegro, the smaller
Yugoslav republic.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will be pointless to take part in the elections for the
federal parliament without Montenegrins,'' said Mile Isakov, a
member of the Serbian opposition delegation.
</P>
<P>
   Under Djukanovic, Montenegro has distanced itself so far from
Milosevic's government that it enjoys virtual independence.
Agreeing to take part in the election would be seen in this
conservative Balkan society as a loss of prestige because it would
acknowledge the authority of Serbia over Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   Isakov said Serbia's opposition understands Montenegro's
misgivings and that as a possible compromise, the Montenegrin
government could continue to say it is boycotting the election
while allowing those who want to to vote anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Djukanovic's position is not at stake in the September election.

<HEADLINE> Levy Engineered Countless Crises  </HEADLINE>
By MARK LAVIE
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- David Levy, serving under five Israeli prime
ministers in 23 years, has set off countless coalition crises with
thundering threats to resign.
</P>
<P>
   In what has long been a staple of Israeli politics, Levy would
withdraw to his working class hometown of Beit Shean in a huff,
refuse to answer the phone and wait for the prime minister to beg
him to rejoin the Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   Levy went as far as actually submitting a letter of resignation
only three times, once in the 1980s, once in 1998 and again on
Wednesday, when he quit as Prime Minister Ehud Barak's foreign
minister. The resignation takes effect Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Triggers for crises ranged from perceived ethnic slurs,
complaints about being shut out of decision-making to differences
over domestic and foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Morocco, Levy immigrated to Israel as a teen-ager. He
parlayed a job in the building trades in Bet Shean into a career in
politics, representing Israelis of Middle East origin, who suffered
from discrimination at the hands of the European-dominated
establishment.
</P>
<P>
   Useful as a symbol of national unity, Levy climbed quickly
through the ranks of the Herut party, now part of the opposition
Likud. He first entered the parliament in 1969, and since 1977
served in successive Likud governments as housing minister, deputy
prime minister and foreign minister, handing in a letter of
resignation to Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir over an ethnic slight,
but retracting it at the last minute.
</P>
<P>
   Insults, perceived or real, led Levy to eloquent denunciations
of prime ministers and threats of resignation. Levy's exaggerated,
flowery style of speech and his carefully coifed crown of white
hair made him an easy target for comedians.
</P>
<P>
   After denouncing Netanyahu and quitting his Cabinet in 1998,
Levy accepted an offer to join Barak, who won the May 1999 by a
landslide.
</P>
<P>
   Though Levy came from the other side of the political fence, he
gamely defended Barak's efforts to make peace with the Palestinians
through concessions, but drew the line when it came to Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Echoing the views of his old comrades in Likud, Levy said
Wednesday that Barak's offer to let Palestinians control parts of
Jerusalem was unacceptable. He said he could not be expected to
''try to explain policies I do not agree with.''
</P>
<P>
   If Levy, now 63, does not withdraw his resignation at the last
moment, his political future will be cloudy. He might return to
Likud, but some say he no longer has electoral appeal, and might
not be assured a place in the next parliament.

<HEADLINE> Maureen O'Hara Remembered  </HEADLINE>
By BOB THOMAS
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) -- She came from Ireland, a
flame-haired colleen with extraordinary beauty and fire in her
hazel eyes. Maureen O'Hara became the Queen of Technicolor and John
Wayne's favorite leading lady.
</P>
<P>
   Her stardom was guaranteed from her first American film, ''The
Hunchback of Notre Dame'' (1939), in which she played Esmeralda to
the Quasimodo of her mentor Charles Laughton. When the studios
adopted the Technicolor process, she appeared in one spectacle
after another, often in pirate adventures including ''The Black
Swan'' (opposite Tyrone Power), ''The Spanish Main'' (Paul Henreid)
and ''Sinbad the Sailor'' (Douglas Fairbanks Jr.).
</P>
<P>
   Director John Ford chose her to appear in several of his films,
often opposite Wayne. The most memorable: ''The Quiet Man,'' in
which she and the Duke matched blow for blow in a classic
donnybrook.
</P>
<P>
   O'Hara, who has made her home in the Virgin Islands since 1968,
was in California recently for a CBS telefilm, her third for the
network in the past few years. The first was based on the best
seller ''The Christmas Box,'' which has become a perennial show for
CBS. A road movie, ''Cab to Canada,'' followed, and now ''The Last
Dance,'' which will appear in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have been No. 1 in our time period for all the shows,'' she
says proudly, ''and I hope we can do it again.''
</P>
<P>
   She had been doing bits and pieces for the camera one spring
morning on Santa Monica beach. The ocean horizon was invisible, the
sky and the Pacific Ocean the same dull shade of gray. The film
company's array of trucks and trailers had encamped in the huge
parking lot next to the Santa Monica pier. The star's trailer
matched all the others, nothing fancy.
</P>
<P>
   ''I like the urgency of television, but I don't like the long,
long hours,'' she admits. ''In the studios we quit at 6 o'clock. I
used to keep an alarm clock on top of the camera. When it went
brrrrr! I said, 'Good night, boys, see you all tomorrow.'''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout her long film career, O'Hara came across on screen as
a beauty with warmth and intelligence, a self-sufficient woman.
</P>
<P>
   At 79, her beauty remains unblemished. She doesn't dwell on the
rough spots in her life: two failed marriages, the unexpected death
of her greatest love. The only time during the interview when she
came close to weeping happened when she contemplated that tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   She was born Maureen FitzSimons (pronounced Fitz-SIME-ons) near
Dublin on Aug. 17, 1920, one of six children. Her earliest
ambition: to be the No. 1 actress in the world -- ''and when the
whole world bowed at my feet, I would retire in glory and never do
anything again.''
</P>
<P>
   Her mother was a noted operatic soprano, and her father owned
most of the top soccer teams in Ireland. He took young Maureen to
the games and to boxing matches, which she adored.
</P>
<P>
   Because of their mother's singing, the FitzSimons children were
raised in the theater. At 14, Maureen was accepted for training at
the legendary Abbey Theater, where she won all the competitions.
When American entertainer Harry Richman was singing in Dublin, he
met the FitzSimons parents and Maureen. In London, Richman spread
the news about the teen beauty.
</P>
<P>
   A film company asked if the girl could come to London for a
screen test. At first the parents said no, but an Abbey actress
convinced them it was the chance of a lifetime. For the test, the
17-year-old was plastered with heavy makeup and dressed in a slinky
gown ''that made me look like Mata Hari.'' Laughton and his
producing partner Erich Pommer had been looking for an actress to
appear with Laughton in ''Jamaica Inn,'' to be directed by Alfred
Hitchcock. They considered the test awful, but both were fascinated
by the girl's hazel eyes. She was hired.
</P>
<P>
   With the war starting in Europe, filming in England shut down,
and Laughton and Pommer moved their operation to Hollywood. O'Hara
went along to star in ''The Hunchback of Notre Dame.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I came on the Queen Mary, and the first stop in America was
New York City,'' she recalled. ''My first impression was bald heads
and billboards. I had never seen so many of either.
</P>
<P>
   ''My first impression of Hollywood: too much sunshine and too
hot. I didn't like the sun because I burn. I loved seeing the
oranges growing on the trees. The studio took us to a place where
there were orange trees and snow on the mountains behind. That was
the big photograph then. Now with the smog you can't see the snow
on the mountains.''
</P>
<P>
   With the 1941 Oscar-winning ''How Green Was My Valley,'' her
first film with Ford, O'Hara became a much in-demand star. For the
next 25 years she demonstrated her versatility in tear-jerkers,
Westerns, pirate movies, comedies and dramas, often before the
Technicolor camera, which seemed to have a love affair with her
lovely face and vivid coloring. Her biggest hits: ''Miracle on 34th
Street'' and ''The Parent Trap.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Rio Grande'' in 1950 marked the first of her five co-starring
roles with Wayne. She cherishes that relationship, and she proudly
talks about an interview he gave: ''He said he preferred to work
with men, and he had just men as friends. Except for one person:
Maureen O'Hara. 'She's a great guy.'''
</P>
<P>
   She also won over the predominantly male film crews, especially
the stuntmen.
</P>
<P>
   ''In 'McLintock!' I had to fall off a ladder three stories tall,
backwards into a water trough,'' she recalls. ''During the day, the
stuntmen would come to me and give me hints on how to hold the
ladder, how to plan the fall. They were wonderful to me.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Hara's first marriage, to director George Hanley Brown, was
annulled; her second, to director Will Price, ended in divorce but
produced a daughter, Bronwyn, named after a character in ''How
Green Was My Valley.'' In 1968 she fell in love with Brig. Gen.
Charles Blair, as much of an adventurer as any of her swashbuckling
co-stars.
</P>
<P>
   Blair had been an Air Force pilot who had set many records,
including the first man to fly solo over the North Pole. He had
been a senior pilot for Pan American Airlines and had founded his
own airline, Antilles Air, in the Caribbean. He and O'Hara had been
friends since he flew her on the first flight to Ireland after the
war.
</P>
<P>
   The actress gave up her career after their marriage and made
their home in St. Croix, Virgin Islands. ''It was time I married a
wonderful man, and boy, I didn't want to waste a minute,'' she
says. ''It was the best thing that ever happened to me in my
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Blair was killed in a crash off St. Thomas in 1978. O'Hara was
asked how she heard the news.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was in Ireland, and I had just had cancer surgery, and ...''
</P>
<P>
   She hesitates and stops, holding back tears. When she regains
her composure, her only comment is: ''a dirty deal.''
</P>
<P>
   She had little time for sorrow after Blair was killed. She
assumed the presidency of Antilles Air with its 22 planes, 26
pilots, huge expenses and dealings with government agencies. She
finally sold the airline, as she and Blair had planned. In 1991,
she returned to films after an absence of 20 years to star with
John Candy and Anthony Quinn in ''Only the Lonely.''
</P>
<P>
   She has continued to live in a large house at St. Croix, which
has been rebuilt twice because of hurricanes. She plans to move
into a condominium since her many grandchildren (Blair had four
children in an earlier marriage) are grown and seldom visit. She
spends summers in Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm always busy; at least I can never be called a couch
potato,'' she says. ''I work a lot for the aviation museums and my
golf tournament in Ireland. It all takes time. But it's good, it
keeps you moving, keeps you busy. It's healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking back over the studio years, O'Hara laments that all of
her leading men are gone now: ''Laughton ... Tyrone Power, John
Payne, Cornel Wilde, Henry Fonda, Jimmy Stewart, Brian Keith,
Walter Pidgeon, and, of course, the old Duke himself.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were wonderful to work with. Every one of them became
personal friends of mine. I was very proud that I made two, three
and up to six movies with them. And never at any time when they
heard it was me did they say, 'Oh, God, not that dame again!'''

<HEADLINE> The Appeal of Invisibility  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GERMAIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Invisible Man has never looked so good.
</P>
<P>
   The notion of a man pulling the ultimate disappearing act has
fascinated people since ancient times. Now the special effects of
''Hollow Man'' add a grisly realism to the concept, which has come
a long way from the bandages and goggles that enshroud Claude Rains
in the 1933 classic ''The Invisible Man,'' based on H.G. Wells'
novel.
</P>
<P>
   Invisibility's appeal has always been part personal fantasy,
part bogeyman terror. Matt Greenberg, who created the new Sci-Fi
Channel series ''The Invisible Man,'' said it's a universal
fantasy.
</P>
<P>
   ''Growing up, I had dreams about being invisible, but not for
the usual reasons about eavesdropping or peaking in at people,''
said Greenberg, whose show deals with an ex-burglar implanted with
a gland that makes him invisible. ''For me, it was about escape. I
was a shy child, so I'd imagine being invisible and going to school
and nobody would be able to see me.''
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Bacon, who stars in ''Hollow Man,'' also dreamed as a boy
about what he might do if no one could see him.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I was a kid, I used to fantasize about it all the time.
Girls' locker rooms, girls' showers. It's the best way to take a
peek,'' Bacon said. ''I've since had the luxury of seeing naked
girls, so I don't really fantasize about being invisible anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   For many early civilizations, legions of supernatural forces
acted unseen on people's lives. In ''The Aeneid,'' Venus pulls the
shades from Aeneas' eyes so he can see invisible gods fighting on
behalf of the Greeks at Troy.
</P>
<P>
   Mythology and folklore are rife with devices that confer
invisibility, including Jack the Giant Killer's cloak, the helmet
of Perseus, the Arthurian legend of Luned's ring -- right up to
Harry Potter's Invisibility Cloak.
</P>
<P>
   Shakespeare, Dante and Ben Jonson wrote about fern seed or the
quartz heliotrope and their supposed power to make people
invisible.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Stewart's best buddy in ''Harvey'' was a 6-foot rabbit
invisible to everyone else. Abbott and Costello met the Invisible
Man in a 1951 comedy. Mia Farrow had invisible escapades in Woody
Allen's ''Alice.'' And ''Memoirs of an Invisible Man,'' starring
Chevy Chase, turned the concept into a comic spy caper.
</P>
<P>
   In ''Hollow Man,'' audiences see Bacon vanish from skin to
organs and blood vessels to bone, all while his character,
Sebastian Caine, writhes in agony on a lab table.
</P>
<P>
   After he's gone, his presence is marked with crafty, creepy
computer effects showing Caine as a wispy ghost in mist, a
crystalline figure in water, a predator splattered with blood.
</P>
<P>
   When he first signed on, Bacon thought he could practically
phone in his role, since Caine is invisible for most of the movie.
For realism in interactions with the other actors, though, director
Paul Verhoeven had Bacon on set the whole time, painted blue, green
or black so he could be blotted out later and a digitized invisible
Caine substituted by computer.
</P>
<P>
   In some scenes, Caine is visible as a skinless monster of organs
and sinew.
</P>
<P>
   ''The complexity of what we did here surpasses anything we did
in 'Starship Troopers,' where you're making things that don't exist
and trying to make them fully alive,'' Verhoeven said of his 1997
sci-fi war story that featured armies of giant bugs.
</P>
<P>
   ''To digitally recreate a complete, muscular man went way beyond
the amount of detail even that's necessary to build something like
a digital dinosaur.''
</P>
<P>
   The appeal of invisible man horror flicks is fear of what can't
be seen, said Ken Graffeo, a home-video marketing executive at
Universal, which is issuing the DVD debut of Rains' ''The Invisible
Man'' on Aug. 29. ''With a monster, you can see it. But the real
horror is when you can't see it, but you know it's there.''
</P>
<P>
   The ring of invisibility pops up repeatedly, from ancient
philosophy in Plato's ''Republic'' to modern fantasy in J.R.R.
Tolkien's ''Lord of the Rings.'' Plato used the idea of
invisibility to examine morality, saying anyone with such power
would be like a god and could not resist the temptation to do evil.
</P>
<P>
   It was that theme that attracted Verhoeven to ''Hollow Man.''
</P>
<P>
   ''How far would you go into evil if you knew you could get away
with it? If the restraints of society were not around you, what
would you do?'' Verhoeven said. ''To see how the shadow takes over
the whole personality, so ultimately, only evil is left. That
process of deterioration is what I thought was fascinating.''
</P>
<P>
   Wells' 1897 novel brought a sense of science to invisibility.
The book delved into such practical matters as how to climb stairs
when you cannot see your feet, and how an invisible man can eat and
remain unseen when the food inside him remains visible until it's
digested.
</P>
<P>
   But like ''Hollow Man,'' ''The Invisible Man'' novel and movie
also examined the megalomania that might accompany invisibility.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a sense of power that comes with invisibility,'' said
Bill Warren, a science-fiction expert whose books include ''Keep
Watching the Skies!: American Science Fiction Movies of the '50s.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's almost like being a ghost without being dead. This sense
of phantom power. You can have an effect on the world with no one
knowing who's causing it. It's like billionaires you never hear
about but who can make things happen the world over. They're
invisible men, in a way.''
</P>
<P>
   While Verhoeven subscribes to Plato's dark speculation that an
invisible man would lapse into wickedness, Bacon is more
optimistic, saying he has faith ''in the basic goodness of people.
I think if people could become invisible, they might have some fun
with it, test the boundaries. I don't think most people would
become Sebastian, and rape and kill.''
</P>
<P>
   What would an invisible Kevin Bacon do?
</P>
<P>
   ''I would skip all these interviews so I could avoid that
question,'' Bacon said.

<HEADLINE> Eritrea Plight Pulls Keneally Back  </HEADLINE>
By ANDREW ENGLAND
<TEXT>
<P>
   AFABET, Eritrea (AP) -- A group of elderly men and women look up
from their makeshift shelters and wave to the man with an elfin
beard and a floppy blue sun hat. Thomas Keneally, prize-winning
author of ''Schindler's List,'' is an old friend who has returned
to help.
</P>
<P>
   He wanders through the dust and thorn bushes of Afabet camp
where 44,000 of the roughly 1 million Eritreans who were forced to
flee a border war have found temporary shelter. Trailed by a small
army of curious children, Keneally stops at cramped tents to chat
with the refugees who huddle inside.
</P>
<P>
   In one such tent, he sits on a scruffy mat and listens to men
too old to be in battle tell their tales of woe, while young
mothers breast feed their babies and shy children peep from
darkened corners. He leaves the tent shaking his head, his face
torn in a grimace.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, he hears war stories from a grandmother who brews thick
Eritrean coffee over a charcoal burner in a terra-cotta beaker.
</P>
<P>
   Keneally is on his fourth visit to Africa's newest nation, one
he first came to know in 1987 when it was in the throes of a
26-year rebellion against Ethiopia. Another war, this time over the
border that was never properly defined once Eritrea won
independence from Ethiopia in 1993, has brought him back.
</P>
<P>
   He returns to the region again in his latest novel, ''Bettany's
Book.'' Set partly in the world of an AIDS worker in southern Sudan
in the 1980s and '90s as well as in Australia of the 1840s, it is
to be released later this year by Doubleday in the United States
and Random House in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Africa and the Holocaust, Keneally has written about the
famine in 19th-century Ireland and British convicts deported to
Australia.
</P>
<P>
   ''Schindler's List'' was published in Britain in 1982 as
''Schindler's Ark,'' before Keneally ever visited Eritrea. The
book, considered by some to be more a work of journalistic
reporting than a fictional account, was awarded the Booker Prize, a
top literary honor in Britain. And it captured the souls of
movie-goers with Stephen Spielberg's Academy Award-winning movie in
1993.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Sydney, Australia, in 1935, Keneally completed his
schooling then began theological studies for the Catholic
priesthood. But he abandoned his pursuit in 1960 and turned to
teaching before publishing his first novel, ''The Place at
Whitton,'' in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   He has had a celebrated writing career, and has been
short-listed for the Booker Prize four times: ''The Chant of Jimmie
Blacksmith'' in 1972; ''Gossip From the Forest,'' in 1975; and
''Confederates'' in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Keneally's journey to the Afabet refugee camp began one evening
in mid-June as he watched television at his home in Australia. He
saw footage of the Eritrean towns of Teseney and Barentu, captured
and allegedly looted by Ethiopian forces who launched an offensive
deep into Eritrea on May 12 in an all-out bid to end the two-year
war.
</P>
<P>
   ''The wreckage ... this was too far into Eritrea. I was quite
angry,'' he recalls.
</P>
<P>
   Ten days later, the 64-year-old Keneally was on a plane from
Sydney to Eritrea's leafy, temperate capital, Asmara, 68 miles
south of Afabet.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's more or less a friend I feel a duty towards,'' he says of
the small country in northeastern Africa that takes its name from
the ancient Greek Erythree, for the Red Sea that laps at its coast.
</P>
<P>
   A cessation of hostilities signed June 18 brought a halt to the
war that broke out in May 1998 and has cost the two impoverished
countries up to $1 billion in arms as well as the lives of tens of
thousands of their citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Though ostensibly about the disputed 620-mile border, the
conflict has deep roots in the complexities of the Horn of Africa.
Each country accuses the other of starting the fight.
</P>
<P>
   With its proud people and beautiful, sleepy towns nestled
between dusty plains and rocky mountains, Eritrea has enthralled
many visitors, and Keneally is no exception.
</P>
<P>
   The romance began in 1987 when he ventured deep into the harsh,
beautiful country with the rebels who had dug bunkers into
mountains, and he fell in love with the people and their struggle.
</P>
<P>
   ''It might have been a little bit of the Stockholm syndrome -- we
were all stuck together, and the conditions were pretty harsh,''
Keneally says, trying to explain how the affair began.
</P>
<P>
   So under the spell was he after his first three-week trip that
Keneally wrote what he called ''the only book I have written with
such direct political purposes,'' in support of the independence
struggle of Eritrea, a country he said that ''refused to be the
typical African victim.''
</P>
<P>
   His initial plan, inspired by the efforts of rock star Bob
Geldof in launching Live Aid to raise funds for the millions of
starving Ethiopians (and Eritreans) in 1984, was to write about the
politics of famine.
</P>
<P>
   But that idea was pushed aside as he walked ''like a
five-year-old holding my uncle's hand'' through the lives of the
Eritrean freedom fighters in their underground existence.
</P>
<P>
   ''Towards Asmara,'' published in 1989, became a work about
ending the war with Ethiopia and creating international awareness
about the Eritrean struggle for independence.
</P>
<P>
   Narrated through the eyes of an Australian journalist traveling
with the guerrilla fighters and who marvels at their commitment and
organization, the novel espouses the cause of Eritrean independence
and is punctuated by exclamation marks as if to tell the reader,
''Believe this, it's incredible!''
</P>
<P>
   Keneally's experiences led him to believe that Eritrea could
become a rational society -- a model for the rest of Africa.
</P>
<P>
   He still rhapsodizes over its social cohesion, independence of
spirit and dignity, and recalls the exhilaration he felt with the
guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   Facing a much larger, better-equipped enemy, the Eritreans, he
says, fought with a combination of cunning and a never-say-die
courage and passion for their cause, supported by civilians who
lived equally covert lives operating in hospitals, schools and
workshops hidden in caves and bunkers.
</P>
<P>
   To many, the struggle was a classic one that pitted David
against Goliath -- the oppressed, romantic, minority against the
tyrannical oppressor, first in the guise of Emperor Haile Selassie,
then against Col. Mengistu Haile Mariam, the Marxist dictator who
overthrew him in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   The war ended in 1991 when Ethiopian rebels -- who had fought
alongside the Eritreans -- entered the capital, Addis Ababa, and
Mengistu fled. Following a referendum, Eritrea became independent
in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   But although relations with Ethiopia were good for the first few
years, they began to sour, and tensions soared in November 1997
when Eritrea introduced its own currency and abandoned the
Ethiopian birr.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Eritrean troops were the first to cross the
disputed border in May 1998, as far as Keneally is concerned,
Eritrea is again the victim, again the unlawfully attacked, again
ignored by the international community.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are kicking from our 20-meter line, and they are in our
half,'' he says, using a rugby metaphor to illustrate the
territorial advantage Ethiopia now holds.
</P>
<P>
   The Eritreans offered him citizenship in 1993, and he would have
accepted, were it not for Australian law that prohibits dual
nationality.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to assess Eritrea's progress in the past seven years,
Keneally says there have been positive gains in education, health
care and infrastructure. But he regrets that the one-party state
has yet to embrace democracy.
</P>
<P>
   If they did, ''it would be one less stick for the world and
Ethiopia to beat Eritrea with,'' he says, insisting he is not an
apologist for the regime of former guerrilla leader-turned
President Isaias Afwerki but a novelist who has also written about
the persecution of Jews, the famine in 19th-century Ireland and
British convicts deported to Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Novelists, he says, write about fraternity and love across
borders, race and culture and about characters who have everything
against them ''because the best stories are there.''

<HEADLINE> Portuguese Discover Artistic Wealth  </HEADLINE>
By EMMA GILBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRAGA, Portugal (AP) -- Most Saturdays, hundreds of local people
gather at the hilltop church here for weddings and baptisms,
lingering afterward outside the 18th-century monument to take
family photos.
</P>
<P>
   The backdrop is staggeringly beautiful: leading downhill from
the Bom Jesus church's majestic twin-tower facade is a giant,
330-foot-long baroque staircase in granite, studded with remarkably
ornate fountains and striking statues.
</P>
<P>
   Portugal has some of the richest examples of such baroque art in
the world, but its historical value and importance went largely
unnoticed -- even for many Portuguese -- until an American visitor
brought it to a wider audience.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Chester Smith, a Harvard University graduate who became
an internationally renowned art historian, arrived in Lisbon in
1934 at the age of 22 and was enthralled by Portugal's artistic
wealth.
</P>
<P>
   ''Of all the nations of Western Europe, none has a more glorious
history or a richer artistic patrimony than tiny Portugal, a
country occupying less than one-fifth of the Iberian peninsula
along the Atlantic coast,'' Smith wrote in the introduction of his
1968 book, ''The Art of Portugal 1500-1800.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith devoted a large part of his working life to studying and
cataloging Portuguese art and architecture, especially from the
baroque period. This style, prevalent from 1550-1750, is
characterized by detailed ornamentation and curved rather than
straight lines.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the country's finest baroque buildings date from the
so-called golden age of Portuguese discoveries, when navigators set
sail to discover the New World. Though then a small country of only
about 2 million people -- compared with 9.9 million now -- Portugal
gained huge wealth from trade in spices with the East and gold and
sugar from plantations in Brazil, which was then a colony.
</P>
<P>
   That wealth paid for the many monuments which still stand.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the baroque buildings are in the north of Portugal. At
Tomar, about 70 miles north of Lisbon, the Church of Nossa Senhora
de Conceicao is unremarkable from the outside and attracts little
attention. But inside, the detail on the delicately carved
Corinthian columns is astounding.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, in his usual sober tone, remarked that ''the serene and
graceful architecture of the interior is unsurpassed.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1940s, Smith's studies also led him to Brazil, which was
granted independence in 1822. There, he traveled widely,
documenting Portuguese colonial architecture.
</P>
<P>
   When he died in 1975, Smith bequeathed some 12,000 photographs
of Portuguese and Brazilian art and architecture to the
Lisbon-based Gulbenkian Foundation, a charitable body that promotes
arts internationally.
</P>
<P>
   Those photos and excerpts from Smith's extensive handwritten
notes form the backbone of a recent exhibition in Lisbon
celebrating Smith's work. It was part of a series of events to mark
this year's 500th anniversary of Portugal's presence in Brazil. The
organizers now plan to take the exhibition, entitled ''Robert C.
Smith: the Investigation Into Art History,'' to Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   ''Smith was the right man in the right place, with the right
background and with the right convictions,'' said Dalton Sala, a
Brazilian who was the exhibition commissioner. ''He opened the
minds and eyes of Portuguese and Brazilians to their art and its
background.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith at first was drawn to Portugal to study the work of
18th-century Italian architect Luigi Vanvitelli (1700-1773), who
designed a chapel at the Sao Roque church in Lisbon. The chapel,
commissioned by King John V of Portugal and now a pool of calm amid
the capital's grinding traffic jams, is viewed as the epitome of
classical baroque.
</P>
<P>
   Smith was staggered by the beauty of its decoration in lapis
lazuli, rare marble, gold and silver and decided to explore
Portugal more widely. The chapel ''suddenly opened a door for me to
Portugal,'' he later said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith went on to Brazil in 1946, traveling widely as he studied
examples of Portuguese colonial architecture from Rio de Janeiro to
Sao Paulo and then to Minas Gerais province and finally the
Brazilian northeast.
</P>
<P>
   He documented the architectural styles employed in Brazilian
forts built by Portuguese military engineers in the 17th and 18th
centuries, many of them located along the coast to protect shipping
and key ports.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the Principe da Beira fort in the Amazon near the
Bolivian border is an example of the ''prefab'' system the
Portuguese used. The stone was cut in Portugal and numbered and
sent as ballast in the Portuguese sailing ships.
</P>
<P>
   Following detailed architectural plans, the buildings --
including churches, forts, municipal buildings and jails -- were
erected quickly and efficiently. Slabs for pavements were also used
in fast-growing Brazilian cities. The ships' empty holds were then
used to bring back gold and sugar.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the most notable Portuguese stonemasons, woodcarvers and
engineers who went to Brazil were from the region of Braga, a city
180 miles north of Lisbon.
</P>
<P>
   Eduardo Oliveira, an art historian and curator of the Braga
public library, says the demand for these skilled men in Brazil
created unprecedented administrative procedures as the local
authorities struggled to keep the artisans at home against the
allure of highly paid work in Brazil -- a kind of ''brain drain.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The exodus of Portuguese artisans to Brazil was so great,
especially from northern Portugal, that the government issued what
were the first passports, obliging Portuguese citizens wishing to
leave the country to obtain a special travel document,'' Oliveira
said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, too, was a kind of builder: Oliveira credits Smith as
being ''the architect'' of Portuguese art history, bequeathing
knowledge and approaches on which others have expanded.
</P>
<P>
   ''He built the foundations, the main walls and much of the
decoration'' of the way of researching and writing about art
history in Portugal, Oliveira says.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was as if he had a computer in his brain, his memory was so
good. He was the first to delve into the Portuguese archives and to
top it all he had enough money to hire staff to do research for him
and to own a car -- few in Portugal had such tools in those days.''
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition ''reflects the way Smith went about things,''
said Helmut Wohl, Professor of Art History Emeritus and Fellow of
the University Professors, Boston University. ''Smith was
passionate about what he did and had a great capacity for work.''
</P>
<P>
   Wohl said he and Smith became friends, though Smith was ''very
difficult to know. I don't think he ever said a personal thing to
me. You never exactly knew what was behind the facade.''
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, at the University of Pennsylvania, Smith
obtained outstanding honors for his work. He became a full
professor there in 1956, a position he held until his death. He
also was keeper of the Archive of Hispanic Culture at the Hispanic
Foundation at the Library of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Wohl said Smith ''was the foremost authority on European and
American decorative arts'' during his lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   Smith published 14 books and contributed many articles to
journals in the United States, France, Portugal, Brazil and
Argentina on a wide variety of topics related to
Portuguese-Brazilian, Spanish-American and U.S. art. He was fluent
in French, German, Italian, Spanish and Portuguese.
</P>
<P>
   In recognition of his landmark research, the Portuguese and
Brazilian governments awarded Smith four of their highest national
decorations.
</P>
<P>
   Leading Portuguese architect Nuno Teotonio Pereira says Smith
took advantage of his outsider's viewpoint.
</P>
<P>
   ''People from abroad have a greater capacity of observation than
those living in the country. They possess a greater distance, a
better capacity to observe -- especially people like Robert C. Smith
who had the knowledge and wisdom to be able to appreciate what a
country has to offer,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Royal Academy Promotes Drawing  </HEADLINE>
By GRAHAM HEATHCOTE
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Attention-getting young British artists like
Tracey Emin, who exhibited her unmade bed, and Damien Hirst, who
pickles dead animals, may have done fine without studying how to
draw the human figure.
</P>
<P>
   But members of an older generation of artists, such as David
Hockney, Maggie Hambling and Peter Blake, insist the centuries-old
life drawing tradition is crucial for any artist.
</P>
<P>
   The Royal Academy of Arts, which has taught drawing since its
founding in 1768, contends the exercise can play a powerful part in
the development of young people's creativity.
</P>
<P>
   For the past 11 years, the academy's Outreach Program has taught
drawing by taking live models to some 40,000 children in British
schools, from Shetland in the north to the Channel Islands in the
south.
</P>
<P>
   ''I love children's drawings and I have many in my hall at
home,'' said Phillip King, a sculptor recently elected the
academy's president. ''Outreach is an opportunity for the young to
enrich the quality of their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   The program sends men and women models to schools for a day to
pose nude. As many as 30 students form a circle around the models
in a large open space and work on the floor with charcoal and large
sheets of paper, drawing what they see.
</P>
<P>
   The workshops are led by artist-graduates from the Royal Academy
schools and the models have been through dance and drama training
to be able to give their poses a forceful quality. The models don't
remain in one position for hours, but take up several poses to
communicate the dynamics of the human form.
</P>
<P>
   ''Big spaces and large sheets encourage children to be more
aggressive in drawing. Charcoal is more physical than pencil. It
gets the hands dirty and makes an immediate impression. It's very
flexible and very forgiving,'' said Jo Butler, an artist who works
in the program.
</P>
<P>
   The academy recently displayed at its Piccadilly building in
central London more than 150 children's drawings from Outreach in a
show called ''Alive.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the exhibitors, 11-year-old James Zhao from Dagenham in
east London, said life drawing isn't easy.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've drawn my father at home, but drawing the woman model was
a bit difficult -- especially the arm and the leg, the fingers and
the shape of the hand. I liked discovering how to do it. I like
drawing as a hobby,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The show took its title from a remark by a child at a workshop:
''I felt challenged to produce an 'alive' drawing rather than a
life drawing.''
</P>
<P>
   ''That expressed what Outreach is fundamentally about,'' said
Peter Feroze, a former student at the academy schools and a
founder-member of the program.
</P>
<P>
   Lorna Smith, the model drawn by Zhao and his classmates, said a
key objective of the program is to encourage youngsters to think
about what they see and how they draw it, asking questions like,
'Is this what I see?' and 'Are there different ways of seeing?'
</P>
<P>
   ''The development of curiosity is an essential part of
education, since it benefits all areas of human activity and helps
prepare the young for an independent life,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The mind has to invent, take risks, consider alternatives and
be prepared to learn from failure along the way. Life drawing is a
learning experience.
</P>
<P>
   ''Children are shocked at first to see a nude model but the
embarrassing giggles soon die down -- in seconds -- and the accepting
nature of a group is quite astonishingly quick. By lunchtime you
would think they had been drawing the nude for most of their
lives,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Recognition of the program's value of the program is indicated
in the variety of its sponsors -- in turn, an oil company, a bank
and a Japanese health food company.
</P>
<P>
   It was John Ruskin, the most influential art critic of Victorian
times and himself highly skilled in drawing, who said that when
once we see keenly enough, there's very little difference in
drawing what we see.
</P>
<P>
   This year is the centennial of Ruskin's death and he is very
much back in fashion, with exhibitions and lectures about him in
Britain and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The academy show coincided with the launch of ''Drawing Power,''
a national campaign for drawing by the Guild of St. George, founded
by Ruskin to promote his ideas. It seeks to get everyone interested
in learning how to draw -- not just children.
</P>
<P>
   ''We know from ancient art in caves that man has been drawing
ever since he came to Europe and we want to see drawing more valued
in education. We want to see everyone leaving school being able to
draw and knowing the basics,'' said Julian Spalding, the guild's
master.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 21, more than 500 galleries and museums in Britain will
sponsor drop-in sessions for adults and children to draw with
artists, designers, mathematicians and campaign patrons. The
sessions will be supported with displays of fine art, and technical
and scientific drawings from local collections.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the multicolored digital age, drawing with pencil, chalk or
ink is easily neglected,'' says a campaign statement. ''Artists,
architects, scientists, designers and teachers recognize that the
most original ideas are often generated through the direct action
of the hand, from thumbnail sketches to final visions.''

<HEADLINE> Cindy Margolis Coming to Your TV  </HEADLINE>
By MILDRADE CHERFILS
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- The romp on the sands of trendy South
Beach attracted hundreds of celebrity hopefuls, strutting their
stuff for the TV cameras, hoping to catch somebody's (anybody's!)
attention.
</P>
<P>
   And why wouldn't they get noticed? They were partying into the
wee hours of the morning with Internet pin-up queen Cindy Margolis,
whose uncanny ability to attract attention has earned her the title
of world's ''Most Downloaded Woman'' from the Guinness Book of
World Records.
</P>
<P>
   Margolis was on South Beach recently, taping segments of her
weekly, late-night show, which is due to premiere in syndication
later this month.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Cindy Margolis Show'' is billed as a sexy, interactive,
late-night party, complete with games, celebrity guest appearances
and ''webkini'' contests -- bikini competition to be judged online
by TV viewers.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no place like Miami to have a good time,'' Margolis
said from a blue-and-white tent adjacent to the art deco club/diner
set she retreated to during commercial breaks.
</P>
<P>
   A half-dozen costume changes into the show, Margolis hardly
looked like she broke a sweat (she did carry her own personal
portable fan). She made all the work that goes into having fun look
easy.
</P>
<P>
   The 31-year-old California native started turning heads after
turning a college assignment to start her own business into a
successful greeting-card venture. The home-grown cards with her
pictures on them turned into posters, and the posters helped launch
her career in modeling.
</P>
<P>
   When she created a Web site in 1997 to promote her modeling
career, she attracted a base of loyal fans -- her cyberbuds. The
site, filled with her swimsuit pictorials and other promotional
information, averages more than 500,000 visitors each month.
</P>
<P>
   Network executives started noticing that wherever Margolis went,
her fans followed.
</P>
<P>
   ''It took me a long time knocking on everyone's door, 'Hello, I
have these millions of cyberbuddies, maybe you'd want them to watch
your show,''' she said. Somebody apparently was listening.
</P>
<P>
   Margolis parlayed her business sense into television appearances
on ''The Howard Stern Show'' and magazine covers. She even hosted
her own segment on E! Entertainment. Margolis also spent a year on
the TV game show ''The New Price is Right'' starring Bob Barker.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, ''The Cindy Margolis Show'' was created with the idea
that if she could attract hundreds of thousands to the Internet,
maybe she could do the same on television.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, she attracted a crowd to be on TV with her.
</P>
<P>
   The mostly 20-somethings who flocked to the set ranged from
those hand-picked on the street to curious thrill-seekers. The only
requirement was to keep the energy level up and move nonstop to
spinmaster DJ Skribble's beats, especially when the cameras were
nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Performer Zamien Aki suspected that his nipple rings had
something to do with why he was chosen to be part of the show.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was just standing out there and minding my own business and
someone grabbed me,'' said Aki, 22. The Detroit native danced the
entire night without ever putting on a shirt.
</P>
<P>
   Tracy Lee, 26, didn't need an audition since he had ''the
look.'' The chiseled model just called the show's producers and
ended up taking part in the night's male webkini contest.
</P>
<P>
   ''I decided to do it just for the notoriety,'' Lee said. ''I
asked if they were going to show my face.'' He smiled broadly for
the cameras when Margolis introduced him.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's good to have on your resume'' said Hattie Williams, 19, a
dancer on break from the Alvin Ailey dance school in New York City.
She and her partner had just won a dance contest.
</P>
<P>
   The show also featured a celebrity guest appearance by
television's favorite alien, ALF. The furry creature from the 1980s
TV series was invited by the show's executive producer, Burt
Dubrow.
</P>
<P>
   Dubrow, whose credits include ''Sally Jessy Raphael'' and
''Jerry Springer,'' looked around at the end of the night and
marveled at the show that took him almost two years to bring to
life.
</P>
<P>
   He was especially impressed with Margolis.
</P>
<P>
   ''I knew within 20 minutes it was her,'' Dubrow said. ''She's so
damn likable. She's sweet. She's bright. She's charming.''
</P>
<P>
   Accolades aside, Margolis said she aspires to eventually become
a name brand, ''like Martha Stewart.'' But she warned, ''I don't
cook or clean.''

<HEADLINE> Five Questions With Tony Bennett  </HEADLINE>
By MARY CAMPBELL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Veteran performer Tony Bennett and jazz
singer-pianist Diana Krall might seem an unlikely duo, but they
have been touring together this summer. They each do half the
evening, with a duet at the end.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've been sold out everywhere in Europe. I count my
blessings. I can't believe it. I'm 74 and it's bigger than ever,''
Bennett said in a telephone interview from Hamburg, Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ''Last night I was having dinner at a Chinese restaurant in
Copenhagen and met two teachers who had brought over 163 kids from
Waco, Texas. I sang last night outdoors for 35,000 people at the
Tivoli Gardens. I said to the teachers, 'Have the kids come in.'
</P>
<P>
   ''Count Basie told me when kids visited Fats Waller backstage,
he'd say, 'Got any friends? Bring them.' He'd let them in free and
sit them down front and they'd cheer him. I had 163 kids from Waco
cheering me on last night, someplace in the park.''
</P>
<P>
   Bennett, who has been performing for more than 50 years, won a
Grammy award this year for ''Bennett Sings Ellington: Hot and
Cool.''
</P>
<P>
   He and Krall will perform in 16 American cities from Aug. 4
through Sept. 16.
</P>
<P>
   1. How did you get together with Diana Krall?
</P>
<P>
   Bennett: I heard her at a jazz festival in Perugia (Italy). She
was wonderful. We did Tanglewood a couple of years ago and hit it
off. She gets better every single night. She plays beautiful piano,
right in the groove. She is swinging. She won a Grammy this year
for best jazz vocal album for 'When I Look in Your Eyes.'
</P>
<P>
   2. When you meet young performers, what do they ask you?
</P>
<P>
   Bennett: They all want to know, 'How do you sustain a career?'
They say they want to stay in this business. I tell them to have
fun.
</P>
<P>
   3. Do you still paint often?
</P>
<P>
   Bennett: I paint every day. Tomorrow I'll be painting,
watercolors. I usually paint in the field. I don't know about
tomorrow. I'll take a look. If it feels good, we'll do it, go to
some quiet park or by a riverside. From here, I go to the North Sea
Jazz Festival in Holland and then on vacation for two weeks in
Tuscany and Venice. I'll paint there. A gallery in Hampstead,
London, just had a show of my watercolors and they flew off the
walls. Four galleries in the last two years have shown my paintings
-- in San Francisco, Boston, Naples, Fla. -- and now this one, and
they really sold. Finally, it starts to happen.
</P>
<P>
   4. Do you still often go to museums?
</P>
<P>
   Bennett: Yes. I'm especially interested because I try to paint
academically. I recently saw the Guggenheim collection of paintings
from 1900 until now. I thought the best were John Singer Sargent
and Joaquin Sorolla y Bestida, who's from Valencia, Spain. One of
the fortunate things about traveling is being able to go to
museums. Coming in from the airport, I saw there's a big collection
of Klee here. I'll go to that tomorrow. And paint, and sing at
night. It's a good life, I tell you. I can sing whatever I want.
I'm doing the two things I love to do and I'm getting away with it.
</P>
<P>
   5. Is there a line in any song you sing that sums up your
philosophy of life?
</P>
<P>
   Bennett: There is, in a song I don't sing very often, 'Nature
Boy,' which Nat Cole sang. It's, 'The greatest thing is to love and
be loved in return.' To me, that's the best line of philosophy in
any song.

<HEADLINE> Nashville Sound: Craig Morgan  </HEADLINE>
By JIM PATTERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Once you've survived war, how hard can
it be to make it as a country music singer?
</P>
<P>
   Craig Morgan, a former Army paratrooper, is finding out.
</P>
<P>
   He's approaching his new career with the gung-ho attitude of a
boot camp trainee, asking questions, working hard and staying
dedicated to the mission.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm very much a hands-on artist,'' said Morgan, restless and
full of energy during an interview in an Atlantic Records
conference room.
</P>
<P>
   Appropriately, Morgan is making his mark with the single
''Paradise,'' a song about his 10&AMP;frac12;-year military career. It kicks
off with Morgan calling cadence.
</P>
<P>
   Many days, the 35-year-old singer-songwriter energetically
patrols the offices at Atlantic, prodding employees with questions.
Staffers have heard it a hundred times: ''What are you doing? What
can I do? How can I help?''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes he gives impromptu pep talks.
</P>
<P>
   ''He doesn't do it in a confrontational way,'' said Jon Loba,
who promotes records to radio stations. ''He asks educated
questions, and there's nothing that I ask him to do that he will
not do.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, Morgan does work without being asked.
</P>
<P>
   ''The other day I was in Chicago and I got laid over for an
hour,'' he said. ''So I used the time to call (radio) stations all
over the United States that have been playing my record, and talked
to them and said 'hi' and let them know I appreciate their
support.''
</P>
<P>
   The tenacity wouldn't matter if Morgan didn't have worthwhile
music to offer. Get past the pedestrian first single ''Something to
Write Home About'' and you'll discover that his album ''Craig
Morgan'' is an uncommonly assured hard-country effort, especially
for a first album.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly noteworthy is the witty -- and somewhat funky --
''Ev'rything's a Thing'' and the desperate ''When a Man Can't Get a
Woman Off His Mind.''
</P>
<P>
   But for now, most fans will associate Morgan with ''Paradise''
and its autobiographical video filmed at Fort Campbell, Ky., where
the singer was twice stationed.
</P>
<P>
   From the song: ''Christmas of '89 was a lonely time for
me/Panama was probably fine but it was nothing like Tennessee/I
never thought the day would come when I might have to kill a man/I
did not sleep a wink that night but we won for Uncle Sam.''
</P>
<P>
   Morgan was in Panama as part of the effort to oust Manuel
Noriega. He has seen plenty of combat, some on secret missions.
</P>
<P>
   The Army is still the defining experience of his life.
</P>
<P>
   ''Anybody that's been in the military I think would agree,'' he
said. ''You learn so much and you experience so much that it helps
chisel or define who you are. It made me rely on myself a lot
more.''
</P>
<P>
   But his interest in country music also runs deep, to his boyhood
in Kingston Springs, a small town west of Nashville. His father
Jack Greer played bass in a local band called The CML's (for
country music lovers), and Morgan has played guitar and written
songs since boyhood.
</P>
<P>
   He continued to pursue music in the service. While he was
stationed in Korea, he opened for a performance by Sawyer Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, he decided to leave the military. He was more
than halfway to the 20 years of service for a lifetime pension.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan has a wife and family to support.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was a big chance we took, a big chance,'' he said. But
Morgan and his wife Karen ''spent a lot of time educating ourselves
on this, and trying to see if we really had a shot.''
</P>
<P>
   He decided that he could succeed in music, by giving it his all.
</P>
<P>
   ''Craig showed me his calendar back in March,'' Loba said. ''It
went all the way through 2000. ''He said, 'If you don't have me
busy every day from now to Dec. 31, then someone's not doing their
job.'
</P>
<P>
   ''His energy is just infectious. It makes you more excited about
your job.''

<HEADLINE> Ruben Blades Gets Film and TV Roles  </HEADLINE>
By FRANCISCO PEREZ RIVERA
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Many composers of Latin love songs are basically
heirs to the legacy of the romantic troubadours. Ruben Blades'
lyrics are mainly inspired by facts of contemporary life, and
sometimes can be as shocking as reality itself.
</P>
<P>
   In 1978, his ''Pedro Navaja,'' a sinister song about a Harlem
hood and a murder he commits, hit the top of the charts. It was the
first single from his second LP, ''Siembra,'' which broke all sales
records for salsa.
</P>
<P>
   Blades sees himself as a descendant of the itinerant poets of
the Middle Ages, the minstrels who took the news from one European
town to another in their verses.
</P>
<P>
   ''The minstrels were the ones who told the stories of what
happened in a community. The main difference is that in the Middle
Ages, the itinerant poets walked from one town to another to tell
their stories, and we do it through records and concerts in
different places,'' he said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   ''In more modern terms, I could say that I am a kind of musical
newsman, because I write my lyrics about things that happen in our
reality, things that could be nice or not. Because I think that
music, beyond being entertaining, also should be able to confront
things. ... I think that music should not only aim for our feet or
hips, but also for our head.''
</P>
<P>
   Blades was born in Panama in 1948 to a Cuban mother and a
Panamanian father. He finished school there and in the mid-'60s
enrolled in the Law and Political Sciences Faculty of the
Panamanian National University. At the same time, though, he
started his musical career by singing with several local bands.
</P>
<P>
   In 1968, he traveled to New York, contacted some of the big
names of the salsa scene, and cut a record with the Pete Rodriguez
Orchestra. In the years that followed, he shuttled between the
United States and Panama while recording albums and appearing in
Hollywood films.
</P>
<P>
   At the close of the '80s, he earned his master's degree in
international law at Harvard University. He was defeated in the
1994 presidential elections in Panama, where he ran as a candidate
for Papa Egoro, the party he founded.
</P>
<P>
   He debuted on Broadway in 1997 in Paul Simon's ''The Capeman.''
Blades won a Grammy this year for his Latin-pop album ''Tiempos.''
</P>
<P>
   His recent films include ''The Cradle Will Rock,'' directed by
Tim Robbins and starring Susan Sarandon, Vanessa Redgrave and Emily
Watson, and ''All the Pretty Horses,'' starring Matt Damon and
Penelope Cruz, to be released later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Blades will play the role of a hospital manager in ''Giddeon's
Crossing,'' a new ABC-TV series starring Andre Braugher that is
scheduled to debut this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wasn't thinking of working in TV, because nowadays I'm
concentrating on my music,'' Blades said. ''But we Latins are so
badly represented in the movies and on television that -- because
the character was well-written -- I decided to participate in the
series.''
</P>
<P>
   He is also preparing his new record, a combination of music from
Ireland, Scotland and India, as well as Cuban and Latin American
rhythms.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a very interesting mixture, and we have invited the likes
of Elvis Costello, Phil Collins and other artists to join in the
project,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The album, on the Sony label, is scheduled for release in March.

<HEADLINE> Vivienne Tam Defines 'China Chic'  </HEADLINE>
By FRANCINE PARNES
For The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Asian invasion of fashion by designers around the globe
typically translates into sexy Chinese sheaths, mandarin collars
and kimonos. But what sets Vivienne Tam apart is a different
approach to Asian aesthetics -- her ability to tweak Chinese prints
with a Western twist.
</P>
<P>
   Having made a splash in seasons past with her zany prints of Mao
Tse-tung -- with a bee perched on his nose or pigtails adorning the
Chairman's coif -- the New York designer is no stranger to what
makes China chic.
</P>
<P>
   ''China Chic'' is, in fact, the name of her book to be published
this fall (ReganBooks, HarperCollins), for which she polled people
in the streets of her native China to discover how they define
style.
</P>
<P>
   Style is spiritual to Tam. Worn from Hollywood to Hong Kong, her
stretchy mesh prints come alive with Buddhas, fierce dragons and
peony patterns.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Buddha image has always been in the temple, and I wanted
to make it more accessible to the people,'' says Tam. ''On
clothing, it's like a walking image, not just for the person
wearing it, but for the people looking at it. It's a reminder of
ourselves, that we have Buddha in our heart.''
</P>
<P>
   As for making light of Mao? ''He is such a serious icon,'' says
Tam. ''Everyone is so afraid of him.''
</P>
<P>
   Tam credited Mao in her essay on Chinese style in Newsweek:
''China, for me, has always been a very fashion-driven country.
Where else could one man tell more than 1 billion people what to
wear? From the beginning of his political career, Mao Zedong was a
fashion czar -- but as always, through contradictions. For Mao was
anti-fashion: he tried to equalize people through what they wore.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Tam, with sleek, black shoulder-length hair, managed to
stand out. In 1995 she was named as one of People magazine's ''50
Most Beautiful People.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in Canton, Tam was only a year old when her landowner
parents fled Communist China with their firstborn son. She remained
at home with her grandparents but joined her family in Hong Kong
one year later, after escaping with a couple who pretended to be
her parents.
</P>
<P>
   Fashion came early to Tam, who learned to sew when she was 8
while watching her parents tailor garments. Her bicultural
upbringing fueled her fascination with East-meets-West, which
became her signature style. She spoke Chinese at home and English
at school -- when she wasn't speaking ''Chinglish,'' a language she
concocted with friends.
</P>
<P>
   ''I grew up in Hong Kong where I went to Catholic school, but my
family would go to temples,'' she says. ''It's a hybrid way of
life, where I learned to be more open and accept other people and
other cultures. Therefore my clothing has always combined the two
together. Having this perspective gives me a new way of looking at
things.''
</P>
<P>
   Tam was transformed by cross-cultural childhood experiences,
such as seeing a bride change from her Western white tulle gown
into a traditional red Chinese silk wedding suit, so heavily
embroidered with dragons and phoenixes that it was almost
three-dimensional. ''When I look back, I know these weddings and
banquets were my first fashion shows,'' says Tam, who declined to
give her age.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from Hong Kong Polytechnic University, she
headed to New York with a duffel bag filled with promising designs.
She created her first collection in 1982 under the label East Wind
Code, which refers to an old Chinese saying for good luck.
</P>
<P>
   The good luck paid off.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Tam launched her first collection under her namesake
label. Three years later, she opened her New York store. Last
April, she opened in Tokyo. She also has boutiques in Hong Kong and
Kobe.
</P>
<P>
   High-end stores in the United States, including Neiman Marcus
and Saks Fifth Avenue, sell Tam's styles, ranging from $98 for a
cotton T-shirt to $1,315 for a hand-beaded gown. The company had
1999 sales of $40 million.
</P>
<P>
   Among Tam's greatest hits is her print of Kuan Yin, the Buddhist
Goddess of Mercy. It hangs in the permanent archives of the Museum
of the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York. Former ''Law &AMP;
Order'' star Benjamin Bratt bought a dress with the print for
girlfriend Julia Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   ''Her clothes are the perfect balance of being simple but also
unique,'' Roberts told People magazine. ''You can be comfortable
and still look better than everyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Tam's chic chinoiserie has also shown up on Britney Spears,
Madonna, Goldie Hawn, Lauren Holly and Leelee Sobieski.
</P>
<P>
   Her interest in Asian history and pop culture inspired Tam's
upcoming book about Chinese lifestyle, incorporating fashion and
food as well as architecture and art. Cheongsams and noodle bowls,
Zen gardens and Ming chairs, all figure into the book.
</P>
<P>
   She traveled through Shanghai and Beijing for nearly a month in
1998, asking celebrities and locals to define ''China chic.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I talked to so many different people, from taxi drivers to
artists,'' says Tam. ''For a taxi driver who doesn't have much
money, it's hard for him to understand what's chic. Money or
friendship or family -- that's what's chic to him.''

<HEADLINE> LeAnn Rimes Gets Cameo in Movie  </HEADLINE>
By TOM GARDNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   LeAnn Rimes is the singing voice of actress Piper Perabo in
Jerry Bruckheimer's new film ''Coyote Ugly.'' The filmmakers added
a cameo for the 17-year-old country singer, which marks her movie
debut.
</P>
<P>
   She recorded four songs for the film, which opens Friday,
against her doctor's orders to rest her voice.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's just been one crazy wild ride this year,'' said Rimes,
who was forced to cancel her summer concert tour, scheduled to
begin in mid-July. A strained right vocal cord was the reason
given. She now concedes her ailments are more serious.
</P>
<P>
   Rimes wanted to include Diane Warren's ''Please Remember'' on
her next album. But Warren told her that Bruckheimer was using it
for ''Coyote Ugly.''
</P>
<P>
   ''So when I went over to Jerry and they didn't have anybody for
the soundtrack yet, I'm like, 'I really, really would like to do
this song,' and he said, 'OK,''' she said in a telephone interview
from her Los Angeles home.
</P>
<P>
   Warren's string of hits includes ''How Do I Live.'' Trisha
Yearwood sang it in 1997's ''Con Air'' after Bruckheimer, the
film's producer, scrapped Rimes' version.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was all sort of interesting. Things come back full circle.
It's business,'' Rimes said.
</P>
<P>
   Yearwood got the Grammy; Rimes got the sales. Her version of
''How Do I Live'' sold 3 million copies and was on Billboard's Hot
100 chart for 69 consecutive weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Rimes also recorded Warren's ''Right Kind of Wrong,'' ''But I Do
Love You'' and ''Can't Fight the Moonlight,'' which will be the
movie's first single.
</P>
<P>
   The recording sessions and the filming of her scenes were
completed about three weeks ago. Rimes went ahead with the
recordings, although her doctor had ordered 60 to 90 days of vocal
rest and therapy.
</P>
<P>
   ''We did it in three weeks, which is unheard of to do four
songs. We do like maybe a song in a week and a half, two weeks, so
it was pretty insane and pretty crammed,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There were certain days when I'd say, 'I have to stop,' and
we'd have to do it tomorrow. I started feeling better around the
middle of it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the film directed by David McNally, Perabo is an aspiring
songwriter who works as a barmaid at Coyote Ugly. Rimes' voice is
dubbed when Perabo sings.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's me, but it doesn't sound like me. I softened it. I kinda
sang more nasally.'' she said. ''It was kind of interesting because
they got me back in the studio. They said I sounded too much like
LeAnn. I said, ''Well, I'm sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   However, she gets to sound like herself on the soundtrack album
(Curb Records).
</P>
<P>
   As for her health, ''I've had four cases of tonsillitis in the
past three or four months,'' she now admits. ''I also had a case of
mono, which I'm now coming out of. I think I've had mono for a
little over a year now. It kept on going and then it went into my
vocal cord.
</P>
<P>
   ''It wasn't a polyp or anything. I wanted to keep the polyp off
of it, so that's why I had to cancel the tour. I'd rather be able
to sing 20 years from now than blow it and not be able to.''
</P>
<P>
   She hopes to be well enough to do a short tour of eight to 10
concerts this fall, starting in Reno, Nev., Sept. 29-30.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's getting better, so I should be working again soon,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Rimes said her tour schedule of some 400 concerts in three years
likely contributed to her health problems. The tour followed her
debut hit ''Blue'' in 1996, when she was 13. She won Grammy awards
in 1997 for best new artist and best female country vocal.
</P>
<P>
   ''I really had no rest. I was doing interviews and touring. I
would never do it again,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Her current single, ''I Need You'' (Sparrow/Capitol/Curb), is
from the CBS miniseries, ''Jesus.'' It is in the top five on
Billboard's adult contemporary chart.
</P>
<P>
   Her sixth album -- most of which she wrote or co-wrote -- is due
out early next year.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just picked up writing recently and I love it,'' she said.
''It's going in the direction that I want to head. I don't think
I'm giving anybody anything to yell about, 'Oh, she's going
completely away from country,' but it's definitely got an R&AMP;B feel,
a lot of the '70s kind of rock 'n' roll feel. Stevie Wonder, Bonnie
Raitt, Janis Joplin.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's more of a raw feel. The country part is more of a folk
feel. It's kind of mixed up.''
</P>
<P>
   She said it's the blend that her father Wilbur Rimes listened to
when she was growing up in Mississippi and Texas; mostly country,
but with dashes of rock and rhythm and blues.
</P>
<P>
   Rimes doesn't hesitate to credit her father for her musical
upbringing, despite her lawsuit against him and former co-manager
Lyle Walker. The suit accuses them of siphoning off more than $7
million from her earnings.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've learned a big lesson in life. I've learned not to mix
family and business anymore. I really love my father and I love my
mother and it's really a tough situation right now, but
everything's going to work out for the best and what's supposed to
happen will happen.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been so fortunate to have fans that really stick by me.
Even people that work with me and not being able to go on tour.
Everybody's been so wonderful.
</P>
<P>
   ''Next year I'll be back with a new album and a new tour and
kind of a new LeAnn. I won't be a 13 (year old) LeAnn with 'Blue'
anymore.''

<HEADLINE> Protests Over Navy Bombing Planned  </HEADLINE>
By JAMES ANDERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- The U.S. Navy has deployed a second
aircraft carrier battle group for Caribbean exercises that likely
will involve shelling and bombing on Vieques island -- and another
round of anti-American protests.
</P>
<P>
   Weeks after protests over Navy war games on Vieques produced
more than 200 arrests and injuries to nine sailors, the USS Harry
S. Truman Battle Group could start training as soon as Thursday,
according to a Navy notice published in local newspapers. It said
the exercises could run until Aug. 24.
</P>
<P>
   Navy officials refused comment on any possible exercises on
Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters planned a mass rally on Sunday outside the U.S.
Army's Fort Buchanan in San Juan. Most of those arrested for
trespassing on Vieques during the June exercises by the USS George
Washington Battle Group were barred from returning as a condition
of their release.
</P>
<P>
   ''These military exercises are a provocation to the people of
Puerto Rico,'' declared Fernando Martin, vice president of the
Puerto Rico Independence Party. In all, there have been more than
400 arrests or detentions on Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   The Truman exercises could include live bombing in open seas,
but would be restricted to non-explosive bombs on Vieques, as
required by a directive by President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy used its Vieques Atlantic Fleet Weapons Training
Facility for live-fire practice from World War II until April 1999,
when an accidental bombing killed a Puerto Rican civilian security
guard on the range. Angry activists occupied the range, and the
Navy suspended exercises.
</P>
<P>
   To resolve the standoff, Clinton in January ordered the Navy to
use dummy bombs on Vieques until its residents vote in a
referendum, expected next year, on whether to expel the Navy. Live
bombing can resume if the Navy wins.
</P>
<P>
   Federal agents peacefully removed the protesters in May. But the
George Washington exercises were marred by violent confrontations
between guards and protesters infiltrating the range.
</P>
<P>
   Several Puerto Rican protesters remain in jail. They have
refused to post bail, saying they don't recognize the jurisdiction
of federal courts in this U.S. commonwealth.
</P>
<P>
   To convince Vieques that it can be a good neighbor, the Navy
recently launched an Internet site to answer criticisms about the
impact bombing has had on the island's 9,400 civilians, who live in
the middle third of the 21-mile-long island.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy is transferring the island's western third, a former
ammunition dump, to Puerto Rico, and is drafting plans to promote
economic development on Vieques with $40 million allocated by
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   It also is paying fishermen who are barred from their fishing
grounds during exercises, hopes to improve medical care on Vieques
and is refurbishing a pier for better ferry service to Puerto Rico,
about 7 miles to the west, said Lt. Jeff Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   Critics claim decades of bombing -- which occurs eight to 10
miles from civilian areas -- have stunted development and tourism,
harmed the environment and caused health problems.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon acknowledged the upcoming exercises might overshadow the
Navy's public relations offensive. ''Training our forces is
paramount,'' he said. ''It's a delicate balance.''
</P>
<P>
   He also claimed that more than 90 percent of arrested protesters
don't live on Vieques and that demonstrations are becoming
increasingly violent. Last Friday, militants threw rocks at sailors
on the range, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not a grass-roots movement. This is a band of thugs,''
Gordon said.

<HEADLINE> NASA: Relax on Clint's Movie  </HEADLINE>
By MARCIA DUNN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPACE CENTER, Houston (AP) -- They're everything NASA wouldn't
want in space shuttle astronauts: sharp-tongued, hardheaded,
hot-dogging cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   Even worse, they've been out of the pipeline for decades and
they're over the hill.
</P>
<P>
   These old-timers are bound for orbit, nonetheless, in ''Space
Cowboys,'' a movie that opens Friday and was produced and directed
by its star, 70-year-old Clint Eastwood.
</P>
<P>
   That's just one of many incongruities in the film, but NASA
doesn't mind this blending of fiction and fact, even if it is
mostly fiction.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a movie. It's not a documentary. Don't worry about
that,'' says Kathryn Clark, senior scientist for the space station
program and a consultant on the film. ''Have fun with the movie.
Enjoy it for what it is.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Space Cowboys'' is about four Air Force aces who get knocked
out of the space race by a chimpanzee in 1958, but who make a
comeback as wrinkled rocket-riders. Eastwood is the leader of the
geriatric pack, the only one who knows anything about the guidance
system on an outdated, out-of-control Russian satellite. Like it or
not, NASA needs him. But he won't go up to fix ''the bird'' unless
his old cronies go, too.
</P>
<P>
   The film also stars Tommy Lee Jones, Donald Sutherland and James
Garner. Jones is the youngest at 53, Garner the oldest at 72. One
newspaper headline in the movie teases, ''The Ripe Stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   NASA has one month to get the four guys ready to fly on the
space shuttle. They're not being launched in the back seat a la
John Glenn, mind you, but up front in the cockpit -- in control of
liftoff, landing and everything in between.
</P>
<P>
   ''Clearly fantasy,'' says Clark. ''If he had to fix the
satellite, you'd put him in back of the ship. Launch him and then
take care of the satellite, right?''
</P>
<P>
   Besides bringing Clint and Co. out of retirement, the film
resurrects NASA's Manned Maneuvering Units, throne-like jet packs
last used in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Three spacewalkers go out en masse in the movie, another NASA
no-no. Only once has NASA broken its two-at-a-time shuttle
spacewalking rule. What's more, the movie spacewalkers zoom every
which way, including down into the bowels of the Russian satellite.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's Hollywood,'' observes Marine Col. Terrence Wilcutt,
commander of NASA's next shuttle flight, a September space station
mission. He cringes at the thought of his spacewalking crew
venturing out into the black void without tethers.
</P>
<P>
   NASA gave Warner Bros. permission to film at the Johnson Space
Center in Houston and the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral,
Fla., and the authenticity shows, especially in the training and
countdown scenes. Launch commentator Lisa Malone, in fact, makes a
cameo appearance as herself. Her words accompanied Glenn back into
orbit, at age 77, in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Eastwood's attention to detail, ''Space Cowboys'' has
some very un-NASA-like moments.
</P>
<P>
   Flight controllers applauding and cheering at liftoff; no one
breathes easy until the shuttle is safe in orbit eight minutes
later. Mission managers clutching their hands and staring
transfixed at the video beaming down from space; normally, they're
consulting with one another or peering at computers. Astronauts
making the talk-show rounds before liftoff; that's saved for when
they get back, if then.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest leap of faith is the premise of sending four old
guys into space, all at once, on such a treacherous mission.
</P>
<P>
   NASA doesn't discriminate on the basis of age, so there's no
reason why older people couldn't fly as long as they're physically
fit, says Dr. Julie Swain, one of the space agency's top doctors.
</P>
<P>
   But never mind the advanced age of Eastwood's character; it's
the lack of space shuttle training that would worry Vance Brand.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years after commanding a shuttle flight at age 59, Brand
still holds the title of oldest space skipper.
</P>
<P>
   ''You could get in the shuttle and do a nominal mission if
nothing went wrong in less time than six months,'' says Brand, who
still works for NASA but in a desk job. ''It's just that if
anything went wrong, you wouldn't be as well prepared to take care
of it.''
</P>
<P>
   In ''Space Cowboys,'' just about everything goes wrong. Nothing
is ''nominal,'' NASA-speak for something going well.
</P>
<P>
   Thank goodness Clint's there to save the day.
</P>
<P>
   ''He'll pull it off, I know,'' Brand says with a laugh.

<HEADLINE> Additions To UK's Pet Passports  </HEADLINE>
By ERICA MICHELSTEIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Fifteen rabies-free islands -- including Australia,
Japan and Hawaii -- will be added to the ''pet passport'' program
that allows cats and dogs to enter Britain without being
quarantined for six months.
</P>
<P>
   The program was implemented in February, beginning with 22
rabies-free European countries. Each passport certifies the pet has
a microchip implant verifying its identity and that it has been
vaccinated against rabies and tested by a government-approved
laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   The 15 islands, which will be added at the end of January, were
included as part of an ongoing expansion process, Agriculture
Minister Baroness Hayman said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Other countries will be considered for inclusion in the pet
passport program in the near future, including the continental
United States, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We obviously have to do this step by step,'' the minister
said. ''In reforming quarantine, we shouldn't be reducing
protection against rabies.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the program's implementation, more than 5,000 pets have
bypassed the six-month quarantine.
</P>
<P>
   The other islands or island groups added to the program are New
Zealand, Singapore, Cyprus, Malta, the Falkland Islands, Vanuatu,
New Caledonia, St. Helena, Ascension Island, Barbados, Montserrat
and Bermuda.

<HEADLINE> Secret of Skin Cancer's Spread ID'd  </HEADLINE>
By JEFF DONN
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two research teams have identified genes that appear to make
skin cancer spread, raising the prospect of quicker diagnosis and
better treatments for the most dangerous tumors.
</P>
<P>
   The two groups separately analyzed a type of cancer known as
melanoma. Each study identified a set of genes that are active in
highly invasive growths. Some genes were common to both studies.
</P>
<P>
   ''For 100 years we've looked at melanomas through the lens of a
microscope and wondered how tumors that looked so similar can act
so different. Now we've used the lens of genetics,'' said Jeffrey
Trent, a senior researcher at the National Human Genome Research
Institute in Bethesda, Md.
</P>
<P>
   Both groups used a technique called gene expression profiling.
Glass slides holding thousands of bits of DNA are exposed to
genetic material from tumor cells. Byproducts of the cells' genes
stick to the DNA on the slide. The technique tells which genes are
switched on in the tumor cells and how active they are.
</P>
<P>
   Trent's team found up to 200 genes associated with highly
invasive melanoma cells.
</P>
<P>
   The second study group, led by scientists at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, narrowed down their invasive set of genes
to just 32.
</P>
<P>
   They went on to test one of them, known as RhoC, in mice to
check if it can make melanomas more invasive. They found that the
most benign melanomas became 50 times more invasive with the active
gene, MIT cell biologist Richard Hynes said. Highly invasive
growths became 80 percent less so when the gene was blocked.
</P>
<P>
   The findings were being published Thursday in the journal
Nature.
</P>
<P>
   Hynes said such work will help lead to genetic tests that could
identify which patients are most at risk, and help researchers
identify new targets for therapies focusing on the most malignant
tumors.

<HEADLINE> Barak Pledges Peace Efforts  </HEADLINE>
By MARK LAVIE
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- A defiant Prime Minister Ehud Barak pledged
Wednesday to press ahead with peace efforts, despite the latest
one-two punch to his political midsection -- the resignation of his
foreign minister and a decision by parliament to call early
elections.
</P>
<P>
   Barak got a breather when the Knesset adjourned for a
three-month recess after giving preliminary approval to the early
elections bill. That gives Barak until late October to finish an
agreement with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister can also use the interval to patch together a
new coalition and stop the unraveling of his government, which
began after most of his coalition partners quit last month over his
decision to go to Camp David for talks with Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians said Barak must act quickly now. ''I think the
road toward a solution is open for both of us,'' said Palestinian
negotiator Nabil Shaath.
</P>
<P>
   ''If Mr. Barak decided ... to be tied down with his desires to
have a majority around him, or to start thinking of elections more
than the peace process, he will probably lose both,'' Shaath said.
</P>
<P>
   In quick developments Wednesday, David Levy announced his
resignation as foreign minister at a crowded news conference in
Barak's own office in the parliament building.
</P>
<P>
   Levy said Barak broke the agreements under which his government
was established last year by offering the Palestinians control of
parts of Jerusalem. Levy said he could not ''try to explain things
that I do not agree with.''
</P>
<P>
   Levy warned that now, an accord would require even deeper
concessions, and the people would not accept them.
</P>
<P>
   Then parliament passed a preliminary reading of a bill to call
early elections for both the prime minister and parliament,
achieving the 61 votes that constitute an absolute majority of the
120 members and that are required for future votes on the bill.
Only 51 members voted against and six abstained.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, disputing Levy, said no concessions have actually been
made because nothing was agreed at the two-week Camp David talks
outside Washington last month.
</P>
<P>
   He told The Associated Press that he would continue his efforts,
but ''we are still quite far apart and we need certain flexibility
from the other side.''
</P>
<P>
   Smiling calmly, Barak said he expected Levy's exit and regretted
it, but ''I am committed, first of all, to moving the state of
Israel forward and averting the danger of war, strengthening the
country through peace agreements.''
</P>
<P>
   Most experts discounted Barak's optimism and gave especially
long odds against his remaining in power. Asked what options Barak
has for reconstituting his government, political analyst Hanan
Kristal replied, ''None.''

<P>
   Hard-line opposition lawmakers said the countdown toward Barak's
downfall was well under way. ''One cannot have a majority around a
plan to divide Jerusalem,'' said opposition Likud leader Ariel
Sharon.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmaker Uri Savir, who took part in the Israel-Palestinian
contacts toward their first agreement in 1993, agreed that Barak's
government cannot survive past the end of the parliamentary recess.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, Savir said, a peace agreement with the Palestinians
must be completed by then. ''I know the issues,'' he said. ''It's
doable and it's necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis and Palestinians failed to agree on a framework for
a peace treaty at the Camp David summit despite extensive personal
involvement by President Clinton.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Decipher Cholera Microbe  </HEADLINE>
By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Scientists have developed the genetic
blueprint of cholera, a step that may point the way to better
vaccines or treatments for the ancient terror that has claimed
millions of lives around the world and remains a hazard in many
nations.
</P>
<P>
   Once widely feared, epidemics of the diarrhea-causing disease
occurred regularly in the United States and other western nations
before modern water- and sewage-treatment processes were developed
in the late 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   It remains ''a living terror for people in the developing world,
not a historical one,'' said Richard Gallagher, biological sciences
editor of the journal Nature, which is publishing the findings
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Cholera is one of nature's most efficient killers, sometimes
claiming lives within hours of onset. The bacterium attacks the
intestine of humans and can cause death by severe dehydration
resulting from diarrhea.
</P>
<P>
   Most lives can be saved with modern rehydration therapy, but
that often is not widely available in developing nations.
</P>
<P>
   A half-million cases have been reported to the World Health
Organization in the last two years with 20,000 deaths, said Claire
Fraser of The Institute for Genomic Research in Rockville, Md.,
whose researchers analyzed the genetic structure of the bacteria.
World Health Organization figures show just under 37,000 cases in
the first half of this year with 2,033 deaths, all but two in
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ''Knowing the (cholera) genome gives us a tremendous opportunity
to better understand its role in the environment and ... also its
effect on humans,'' Rita Colwell, director of the National Science
Foundation, said at a news conference to discuss the report.
</P>
<P>
   The development is especially important in the potential
production of vaccines, added John J. Mekalanos of Harvard Medical
School. He said it provides an ''open book'' of the bacteria's
structure, which will allow researchers to find and delete
dangerous genes before using the bacteria to make vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   ''This will be the starting point for most future studies,''
said microbiologist Matthew Waldor of Tufts Medical School in
Boston. He co-wrote an accompanying commentary on the research,
which also was being published in Nature.
</P>
<P>
   Fraser, director of the group that developed the genome
blueprint, cautioned that, despite the new knowledge of the genetic
makeup, the idea of eradicating cholera ''is probably not
practical.''
</P>
<P>
   The research team found the germ, known as ''Vibrio cholerae,''
has two round chromosomes with 3,885 genes. They are formed from
about 4 million chemical building blocks known as base pairs, about
3 million in the larger chromosome and about 1 million in the
smaller.
</P>
<P>
   The project cost $793,712, Fraser said, or about 20 cents per
base pair.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers identified the genes by chemically breaking up
strands of the cholera DNA. They analyzed the fragments separately
and later determined how to reassemble them in order. Similar
techniques have been used to identify the genes of other disease
microbes and of humans.
</P>
<P>
   Cholera has afflicted humans for more than 2,000 years. The
symptoms were mentioned as long ago as Hippocrates and even earlier
in Sanskrit writings.
</P>
<P>
   It is largely eradicated from the United States and other
industrial nations. The few cases occasionally reported come in
with travelers from infected areas.
</P>
<P>
   Most cases, Colwell said, result from people eating undercooked
shellfish or raw shellfish ''bootlegged'' from beds where fishing
is banned because of pollution.
</P>
<P>
   The bacteria is common in fecal contaminated food and water and
can thrive in brackish coastal waters and bays, Colwell said,
including the Bay of Bengal and even Chesapeake Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Epidemics still plague parts of Asia, Africa and Latin America,
where water supplies often are contaminated.
</P>
<P>
   Colwell said that because the bacteria attach to a tiny
plankton, it can be removed by filtering water. She said
experiments in Bangladesh have had some success filtering water
through layers of cloth used for women's saris.
</P>
<P>
   Cholera epidemics devastated parts of the United States during
the Civil War era and later in the 19th century. The disease led to
development in England of early epidemiological research.
</P>
<P>
   In a case famous in medical history, a cholera epidemic was
ravaging London in 1849, and Dr. John Snow prepared a map marking
the homes of people struck by the disease. Noticing that the cases
centered on a public water pump, Snow persuaded authorities to
remove the pump handle, which forced residents to go elsewhere for
drinking water. As soon as water from the well was no longer being
used, new cases of cholera declined dramatically.

<HEADLINE> Speaker: Clinton Must Compromise  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID ESPO
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- House Speaker Dennis Hastert predicted
Wednesday the final stretch of the congressional session would be
''overshadowed by the elections,'' but urged President Clinton to
compromise in hopes of ringing up year-end accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would think the president really wants to get things done''
before leaving office, Hastert said in an Associated Press
interview at the hotel where he's staying for the Republican
National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from routine spending bills, Congress will be considering
several key pieces of legislation this fall. They include GOP tax
cuts as well as measures that would provide prescription drug
coverage to Medicare recipients, make HMOs more responsive to
patients, and raise the minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, Hastert said, Clinton has not responded to his
overtures for compromise. When it comes to year-end budget issues,
he said, ''there's always a thousand excuses'' from the White House
for why they can't talk.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding presidential politics, Hastert likened Clinton's
recent criticism of GOP presidential candidate George W. Bush to
''trash talk in sports,'' and said Republicans won't rise to the
bait by responding during their upbeat convention week.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you react to a gibe then you're not laying our your own
agenda. You're responding to somebody else,'' said the Illinois
Republican. There will be plenty of time in the fall campaign to
respond to Democratic charges, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton provoked expressions of anger from Bush and his father,
the former president, with comments he made Friday: ''Nearest I can
tell, the message of the Bush campaign is just that, 'How bad can I
be? I've been governor of Texas. My daddy was president, I own a
baseball team.'''
</P>
<P>
   Hastert cushioned his comments somewhat by saying he found
Clinton's remarks a ''little out of character.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Maybe it's the remorse of not wanting to get out of politics
or whatever,'' he speculated, while adding, ''I think most
Americans think that's ill-mannered what they're doing anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Hastert also took a poke at Vice President Al Gore, the
Democratic presidential candidate. Gore, he said, has switched his
position over the years on abortion, guns and tobacco. ''You're
changing your whole philosophy of life. I think people look at that
askance.''
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans are defending a narrow majority in this fall's
elections, and Hastert said he would campaign in as many as 40
districts in the coming month. At one point, he said he thought the
Missouri House district represented by Democratic leader Dick
Gephardt was ''in play,'' but then said he has no plans to go there
to help the GOP challenger.
</P>
<P>
   Congress returns from its summer break on Sept. 5, and Hastert
said he hoped the session could be wrapped up during the first week
of October.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do better when we're back home talking to our
constituents,'' he said, and polls consistently show GOP approval
ratings rise when Congress is not in session.
</P>
<P>
   He said, ''I've gone more than halfway'' toward Clinton to help
with several bills this year, singling out aid to Colombia, trade
bills affecting China, Africa and the Caribbean region and help for
economically distressed regions of the country. ''I had to push
hard to get it out of the House,'' he said of the final measure.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert also said he had called Clinton personally before
Congress completed work on its marriage penalty tax cut to discuss
possible changes designed to gain a presidential signature. Clinton
has vowed to veto the measure, which has been on his desk for
several days.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wish he'd sign the bill.... It's not tilted to the richest
people in the country,'' he said, rebutting a consistent Democratic
charge.

<HEADLINE> Germans Debate Ban of Party  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL GEITNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- Germans need to ''get down from their spectator
stands'' and become involved in combatting neo-Nazi violence if it
is to be eradicated, a government spokesman said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But Uwe-Karsten Heye, spokesman for Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder, rejected calls from some quarters to go after neo-Nazi
''logistics'' by banning the extreme-right National Democratic
Party, saying such steps have been unsuccessful in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's always been new groupings again and again,'' he said.
''Bans clear away neither the subject nor the organizations.''
</P>
<P>
   Debating a ban can be beneficial, but shouldn't distract from
the ''real task'' of organizing societal resistance to extreme
right-wing ideas, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Success is possible only if people make it their business and
come down from their spectator stands,'' Heye said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was afraid that a ''right-wing mainstream'' was
forming in some parts of Germany that tolerates anti-foreigner
activity.
</P>
<P>
   The leader of Germany's Jewish community, Paul Spiegel, echoed
the government's call in an interview in the weekly Die Zeit,
released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   A ''jolt must go through the population now,'' he said, to end
the ''message of agreement and mentality of looking away.''
</P>
<P>
   The main police union joined a proposal to seek a ban on the NPD
from Bavarian Interior Minister Guenther Beckstein, who argued that
the fringe party welcomes and even courts violence-prone skinheads
and serves as a cover for their actions.
</P>
<P>
   While a ban won't turn neo-Nazis into democrats overnight, ''one
can influence the structures,'' Beckstein said. ''These people, who
want to exercise the rule of the fist in the streets themselves,
really notice if the state goes after them with a tough hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Support also came from within Schroeder's Cabinet. Environment
Minister Juergen Trittin of the Greens party conceded that such a
step would be only temporarily effective. ''But that's not a reason
not to do it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But even Beckstein conceded such a step would be legally
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Banning a political party in Germany hinges on proving the party
is aggressively working to undermine the constitution. Such a
proposal must be reviewed by the Constitutional Court, a process
that could take years.
</P>
<P>
   The larger far-right parties, the German People's Union and the
Republikaner, hold seats in three state legislatures, while the
National Democratic Party is electorally insignificant.
</P>
<P>
   But in contrast to the other two, the National Democratic Party
has been gaining members -- from 4,300 in 1997 to 6,000 last year,
according to federal officials -- by staging dozens of rallies and
street marches. Much of their recruiting has been directed at
disillusioned youths in the depressed eastern states, which have
been struggling to overcome decades of communism.

<HEADLINE> WWII Prisoner Recovers Some Memory  </HEADLINE>
By ALEX BANDY
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) -- Using patience and a children's fairy
tale, a psychiatrist says he stirred the memory of a man who spent
53 years in a Russian mental hospital and is now convinced the
patient is a Hungarian taken prisoner in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Since visiting the man, known as Andras Andreyevich Tamas, for
three days last week, Dr. Andras Veer has been trying to bring him
back to Hungary from a psychiatric hospital in Kotelnich, 600 miles
east of Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   ''We really need to expedite the paperwork required to get him
to Hungary where he can be treated properly,'' Veer, director of
Hungary's National Psychiatric and Neurological Institute, said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Hungarian Embassy in Moscow and the Foreign Ministry in
Budapest have been trying to uncover enough about Tamas' early life
to issue him a Hungarian passport.
</P>
<P>
   So far, however, little has been found in either Russian or
Hungarian archives to shed light on Tamas' origins.
</P>
<P>
   According to hospital documents, Tamas was transferred there on
Feb. 19, 1947, from a prisoner of war camp, suffering from
psychological problems, Veer said.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to speak Russian, Tamas could not communicate with
hospital staffers, who mistook his Hungarian for gibberish. Last
year, a Slovak doctor recognized some of the words as Hungarian and
an interpreter was summoned.
</P>
<P>
   In February, the Hungarian Embassy in Moscow sent a consular
officer to visit Tamas. The Hungarian Foreign Ministry then sent
Veer to examine the man.
</P>
<P>
   Over a three-day period, Veer said Tamas' language skills -- and
some memories of his past -- began returning.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am convinced the man is an ethnic Hungarian,'' Veer told The
Associated Press. ''I took with me a fairy tale book and he read
'Little Red Riding Hood' to me in fluent Hungarian.''
</P>
<P>
   Tamas said he was born in Turocszentmarton, a town in
present-day Slovakia now called Martin. It was part of Hungary
until the establishment of Czechoslovakia after World War I.
</P>
<P>
   ''He uses a certain regional dialect characteristic of the north
country,'' Veer said, referring to the former Hungarian territory.
</P>
<P>
   But Tamas was unable to recall his mother's maiden name, or
whether he had any siblings. Officials at the records office in
Martin and the regional archives in neighboring Bystricka said they
have no record of anyone named Tamas.
</P>
<P>
   ''His name is quite foreign to the area and there are no records
of his birth here,'' said Jana Masnicova, an archivist in
Bystricka.
</P>
<P>
   Veer said it was possible Tamas moved to Hungary in his early
years and that local records were destroyed during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ''He also spoke of going to Hungary and being in the Hungarian
army and fighting in the Don region during World War II,'' Veer
said, referring to the area around the Don River of southern
Russia. ''He described a 'hail of grenades' and being transported
by train to Siberia.''
</P>
<P>
   About 150,000 troops fought in the Second Hungarian Army under
Nazi command at the Don River in 1944. Red Army soldiers killed
about 90,000 Hungarians and thousands of others perished in
freezing temperatures trying to make it back to Hungary on foot.
</P>
<P>
   Tamas, who has dark hair and is nearly toothless, had to have a
leg amputated three years ago because of circulatory problems.
</P>
<P>
   Veer's goal is to get him to Hungary for treatment as quickly as
possible, where, surrounded by his mother tongue, the doctor
believes Tamas will recover his memory.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, Tamas remains trapped in time in the dingy hospital,
still believing he is in Siberia.

<HEADLINE> Actor Graves Celebrates Milestones  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Actor Peter Graves is celebrating two
milestones rarely seen in Hollywood -- a half-century in front of
the camera and 50 years of marriage.
</P>
<P>
   The A&AMP;E ''Biography'' host began his career opposite Rory
Calhoun in the 1950 film ''Rogue River,'' and his career continued
through an eight-year run on TV's ''Mission Impossible'' and now
''Biography.''
</P>
<P>
   Graves, 74, called his wife Joan a steadying influence. ''I hate
to think what would ever have happened to me without her good
guidance and affection through certain times.''
</P>
<P>
   After several movies, Graves accepted a part on the series
''Fury'' in what was then the fairly new medium of television.
</P>
<P>
   ''It seemed to be very clear to motion picture producers that
television was beneath contempt,'' Graves said. ''But there were a
lot of actors who had been free-lance actors a long time and knew
it was a dangerous business. The idea of a television series that
guaranteed 39 films a year was very attractive.''

   CARBONDALE, Ill. (AP) -- Former Sen. Paul Simon received some
gentle ribbing from singer Paul Simon about the politician's recent
foray into music.
</P>
<P>
   The ex-senator performed his rendition of ''Hello, Dolly'' with
his daughter's blues band last month in Carbondale.
</P>
<P>
   Wrote Simon the singer to Simon the politician: ''I am being
inundated with requests from bluegrass festivals all over the
country asking me to perform and sing 'Hello Dolly.'
</P>
<P>
   ''Also, do you think you could work up a version of 'Still Crazy
After All These Years' into your next set. It would help me a

</P>
<P>
   The former senator had written to the singer ahead of time,
joking that his musical career would ''plummet'' when news of the
Carbondale performance spread.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was glad to know that he got a kick out of it. I sure had a

<HEADLINE> Study: Quit Smoking, Reduce Risk  </HEADLINE>
By EMMA ROSS
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Giving up smoking even late in life eliminates
most of the lung cancer risk, and the risk is decreased more than
90 percent for those who quit before they turn 35, new research
indicates.
</P>
<P>
   Health experts have said for years that it's never too late to
give up smoking. While studies have shown the effect on lung cancer
rates can be dramatic, research published this week in the British
Medical Journal gives the clearest evidence yet of how beneficial
it can be.
</P>
<P>
   The work also provides the first prediction of the number of
tobacco deaths that will occur worldwide in the next 100 years if
smoking patterns persist -- 1 billion, compared to 100 million in
the last century -- and how many deaths could be avoided if people
quit.
</P>
<P>
   Experts call the findings a warning for public health officials
to refocus their efforts on current cigarette smokers, instead of
concentrating too much on trying to prevent adolescents from
starting the habit.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's been a tendency to write people off once they start
smoking,'' said Stanton Glantz, a smoking researcher at the
University of California-San Francisco who has found similar
benefits for heart disease when people quit smoking.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a wake-up call to the public health community that
they need to get back to the population as a whole,'' said Glantz,
who was not connected with the new research.
</P>
<P>
   The study by scientists at Oxford University was a follow-up of
research that began after World War II, when smoking was growing in
popularity in Britain. In 1950, the group published a study that
was credited with discovering the link between smoking and lung
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Lung cancer is second only to heart disease as the leading
killer of smokers in Europe and the United States. Tobacco has been
linked to more than 20 other diseases and kills half of lifelong
smokers.
</P>
<P>
   Widespread dropping of the habit in Britain since the 1950
revelation has halved the number of lung cancer deaths that
otherwise would be occurring, said Sir Richard Peto, who led the
Oxford study.
</P>
<P>
   Because widespread smoking started earlier in Britain than other
countries and Britons started quitting en masse first, Peto said
the country has seen the world's largest decrease in lung cancer
deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Britain also is experiencing the most rapid decrease worldwide
in all premature deaths from tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   It has led the world in quitting smoking chiefly because the
original study identifying the risk involved doctors, who promptly
started giving up the habit, Peto said.
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco deaths in the United States are following the same trend
as Britain, though there is a lag because the habit was taken up en
masse later.
</P>
<P>
   Deaths among middle-aged men started to drop in the United
States in the early 1980s, compared with the early 1960s in
Britain.
</P>
<P>
   But worldwide, smoking deaths are increasing because people in
other countries started smoking more recently and a lag exists
between taking up smoking and dying from it.
</P>
<P>
   Peto's findings on worldwide smoking numbers are to be published
this month in the book ''Global Health in the 21st Century.''
</P>
<P>
   His research found there already are 1 billion smokers and that,
by 2030, another billion or so young adults will have started to
smoke.
</P>
<P>
   If current smoking patterns continue, worldwide tobacco deaths
will rise from 4 million a year now to about 10 million a year
around 2030, an increase of about 100 million a decade, Peto
estimated.
</P>
<P>
   If trends continue, he predicted about 15 percent of all adult
deaths worldwide in the second half of the 21st century will be due
to tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   ''These numbers of tobacco deaths before 2050 cannot be greatly
reduced unless a substantial proportion of the adults who have
already been smoking for some time give up,'' the study said. ''A
decrease over the next decade or two in the proportion of children
who become smokers will not have its main effect on mortality until
the third quarter of the century.''
</P>
<P>
   The study reports trends in men because that's where the impact
has shown up first, since they took up smoking earlier. Researchers
say the benefits would be the same for women.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how early in life a smoker quits, some of the damage
done is irreversible and the risk of lung cancer never declines to
normal. Recent research has shown that starting before the age of
18 is particularly harmful to the lungs.
</P>
<P>
   But the latest study found that only 2 percent of those who quit
by 30 developed the disease by age 75, compared with a 0.4 percent
chance for people who have never smoked.
</P>
<P>
   It found that 10 percent of those who quit at 60 will die of
lung cancer, and that continuing to smoke into old age results in a
16 percent risk.
</P>
<P>
   Peto said that if the British trends in quitting are mirrored
worldwide over the next decade or two, about one-third of the
tobacco deaths expected by 2020 would be avoided.
</P>
<P>
   Smoking deaths in the second quarter of the 21st century would
be almost half of what they would otherwise be, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Such changes would avoid about 20 million or 30 million
tobacco deaths in the first quarter of the century and would avoid
about 150 million in the second quarter,'' his study said.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Smith of the American Cancer Society said he was
impressed with the findings, but that it remains to be seen whether
they will stimulate renewed interest in helping chronic smokers
quit.
</P>
<P>
   ''We absolutely must not neglect current smokers,'' Smith said.
''We have essentially given up on them. Giving up smoking is
largely considered a private matter between a smoker and his
conscience.''

<HEADLINE> Stocks Climb After Economic Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mostly higher Wednesday, rallying in
the wake of more encouraging news that left investors optimistic
the economy is indeed slowing down.
</P>
<P>
   In late afternoon on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was up 100.00 at 10,706.95.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 6.16 at 1,444.26 but the
Nasdaq composite index gave back some earlier gains and was down a
modest 2.89 at 3,682.63.
</P>
<P>
   Blue-chip stock prices surged after the Conference Board
reported that its leading economic indicators were unchanged in
June.
</P>
<P>
   Some technology companies surged after reporting
better-than-expected second-quarter earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Technology consulting company Sapient Corp. rose $18.938 to
$122.813 after reporting second-quarter earnings of 23 cents a
share, excluding one-time expenditures. The figure beat analyst
expectations by 3 cents. In addition, the company announced a
two-for-one stock split.
</P>
<P>
   And Protein Design Labs rose $20.656 to $153.25 after reporting
earnings of 23 cents a share, beating analysts' predictions of 18
cents.
</P>
<P>
   But Dell Computer was down $1.688 at $39.875 after an analyst
downgraded the stock to buy from strong buy on fears that the
computer retailer might miss its second-quarter revenue
projections.
</P>
<P>
   An important gauge of future economic activity, the Index of
Leading Economic Indicators held steady at 106 in June. If the
forecast is accurate, the numbers would mean a break from rapid
economic growth for the rest of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the government reported that U.S. home sales
declined in June to their lowest level in two and a half years.
</P>
<P>
   Investors viewed both reports as signs that the Federal Reserve
Board's strategy of raising interest rates during the past year has
been successful
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, three other reports also indicated that the economy
is easing after a decade of explosive growth. If so, the Fed may
leave rates stable at their next meeting Aug. 22, which would
benefit the interest rate sensitive Dow Jones industrial stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ''The rally came right after the numbers were released and the
feeling is that there's a relatively good chance that the Fed's not
going to do anything,'' said Tom Gallagher, head of U.S. equity
markets for CIBC World Markets in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Banking stocks benefited on the belief that lending and
underwriting activity of stocks and bonds will stay healthy if
interest rates remain stable. Lehman Brothers rose $5.313 to
$118.063, and Merrill Lynch rose $3.656 to $128.813.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues were ahead of decliners by a 5 to 4 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 774.86 million
shares, ahead of Tuesday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was up 3.29 at 501.06.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Invasion Left Mark on Kuwait  </HEADLINE>
By DIANA ELIAS
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUWAIT (AP) -- Ten years to the day after Iraq's invasion and
occupation of their small Gulf homeland, families of people who
disappeared during that chaotic time gathered at a theater
Wednesday to listen to poems of longing.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven-year-old Rasha al-Sharif left the theater in tears to sit
alone on a bench. Rasha was a toddler when Iraqis arrested her
father. Nobody has heard from him since.
</P>
<P>
   ''Other people are enjoying life,'' she said. ''But we still
live with the tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Rasha said her father was picked up while crossing the border to
Saudi Arabia against Iraqi rules. She knew few other details.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq has not accounted for 605 Kuwaitis and citizens of other
countries who disappeared during the occupation. A decade after the
Aug. 2, 1990, Iraqi invasion and the subsequent U.S.-led Gulf War
that forced Iraq to withdraw, the issue is the biggest stumbling
block to repairing relations between Iraq and its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm prepared to go on my knees to Baghdad if there is any hope
for the release of the prisoners,'' Kuwait's defense minister,
Sheik Salem Sabah Al Ahmed Al Sabah, was quoted as saying in
Al-Siyassah daily on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Baghdad says it has released all war prisoners, and in recent
years has accused Kuwait of withholding information on the fate of
1,150 Iraqis who disappeared during the crisis. Kuwait says it
cannot be held responsible for them at a time when Iraqi
authorities ran the country.
</P>
<P>
   The 10th anniversary of the invasion passed quietly in Kuwait,
where the government held to its annual policy of holding no
official functions to mark the day. The poetry reading, attended by
about 300 people, was organized by a private support group for
families of the missing.
</P>
<P>
   At the reading, 10-year-old Hussein al-Saleh, who has two uncles
among the missing, recited from the work of Kuwaiti poet Khaled
al-Bathal:
</P>
<P>
   ''Who will give us patience? We will be patient if we can,'' he
said. ''Who will be moved by the tears of a little boy? The city's
streets are filled with sadness and our country is impoverished by
their loss.''
</P>
<P>
   People in this state of 2.3 million people, the majority of whom
are guest workers, are still shocked that an Arab country would
take over another overnight.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our wounds have not healed,'' said the editorial of a special
issue of the Al-Anba daily to mark the anniversary. ''On the
contrary, they hurt with every new dawn and whenever we close our
eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   It took Iraqi tanks just a few hours to invade this oil-rich
country. In the decade since, determination by Kuwait and its
neighbors to never again be so vulnerable has changed the political
landscape in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   Kuwait signed a 10-year defense pact with Washington shortly
after a U.S.-led coalition drove out the Iraqis in the 1991 Gulf
War. Similar agreements followed with Britain, France, and Russia,
as well as a defense agreement with other Gulf states.
</P>
<P>
   Kuwait and other members of the Gulf Cooperation Council -- Saudi
Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Oman, Bahrain and Qatar --
established a nucleus of a common army in a mutual defense pact.
But it's clear they believe their real defense lies in their
relationship with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq's aggression led neighboring Saudi Arabia to allow some
500,000 foreign troops, most of them American, into the country.
The legacy of that decision is still felt politically and
economically in the kingdom: The $60 billion bill helped drain the
Saudi kingdom's reserves, and the presence of foreign troops in the
area gave birth to a fundamentalist Saudi opposition.
</P>
<P>
   In Kuwait, political scientist Abdullah al-Shayeji said his
government is spending 25 percent of its annual budget on security,
in addition to some $12 billion earmarked for defense.
</P>
<P>
   As for Iraq, Kuwaitis say enmity between neighbors cannot go on
forever. Some predict a day when the two nations will reconcile and
perhaps join economic forces -- after Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
is out of power.

<HEADLINE> PRI Under Fire in Mexican Politics  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN RICE
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUXTLA GUTIERREZ, Mexico (AP) -- At any other time in Mexican
history, Sami David would be a shoo-in to be the next governor of
Chiapas.
</P>
<P>
   Despite disasters, rebellions and persistent poverty, David's
Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, has never lost in
Chiapas. As recently as July 2 it won 11 of 12 congressional races
here.
</P>
<P>
   But that same night, Mexico's political world turned upside down
when the ruling PRI lost Mexico's presidency -- the head, heart and
soul of the party for 71 years.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, as he races from Indian settlements in the highlands
to gatherings of ranchers on the coast, David finds himself
fighting a crucial battle for the future of his party in the Aug.
20 election, the first state vote since the PRI's presidential
loss.
</P>
<P>
   Even David, who is trailing in the polls, seems to be on the
defensive, admitting that past PRI governments have ignored the
poor in this state of 3.5 million people.
</P>
<P>
   The federal senator acknowledged at a recent meeting of the
state's agronomists' society that the PRI lost contact with its
grassroots communities, resorting to ''demagogy and simulation'' as
it practiced free-market economics on a national level while
promising social advances.
</P>
<P>
   But David warned that, as always, only the PRI holds the
solution: He said Chiapas needs to advance ''with firm steps, not
creating alternative projects that generate violence or social
conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   The meeting at a hotel in this state capital was the sort of
thing that has been a campaign staple for the PRI: The agronomists
are affiliated with a national farm confederation linked to the
party.
</P>
<P>
   But there were signs the old system already is crumbling. With
the PRI losing national power, the agronomists' state chairman,
newly elected PRI Congressman Roberto Dominguez Castellanos, called
for political pluralism in the agronomists' organization, and
David's greeting was mixed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Not all of us agree with having invited the candidate of the
PRI,'' said Martin Mazon, a member of the organization's state
board who said he backs Pablo Salazar, David's opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Salazar, who claims he would be the first practicing Evangelical
to be elected governor, is a federal senator who quit the PRI in
May 1999 after demanding greater efforts to solve the 1994 revolt
of Zapatista rebels. He holds a strong and growing advantage in
recent polls, though nobody is sure how accurate those are in this
complex, conflictive state.
</P>
<P>
   He benefits from an eight-party alliance, including
President-elect Vicente Fox's conservative National Action Party
and the left-center Democratic Revolution Party, which was created
before the July 2 vote.
</P>
<P>
   Chiapas is Mexico's most southern and probably its poorest
state, one where the PRI regularly claimed 90 percent of the vote
until 1994, when a rebellion by Zapatista guerrillas shattered its
image of political unanimity.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the state has repeatedly seen clashes between pro-
and anti-Zapatista forces, as well as what human rights groups say
are paramilitary bands backed by the government. The government
denies such support, and even the existence of the paramilitaries.
</P>
<P>
   Salazar and most human rights groups claim those paramilitaries
were encouraged by the PRI and by the federal government to combat
the Zapatistas, a policy they say led to the 1997 Acteal massacre
in which 45 Zapatista sympathizers were killed by PRI backers.
</P>
<P>
   The Chiapas vote is the first of three state elections the PRI
faces before it leaves the presidency in December. The party has
sent its top officials to the state, and Salazar claims it is also
importing electoral technicians to rig the vote.
</P>
<P>
   At a campaign rally in the mountain center of San Cristobal de
las Casas, he urged supporters to vote early and stay at the polls
to ensure the ballots are not robbed or burned before they can be
counted.
</P>
<P>
   ''On July 2 the PRI entered the hospital for intensive
therapy,'' Salazar said before a crowd of 300 Tzotzil Indians. ''On
Aug. 20, we are going to disconnect the oxygen tank and give it a
Christian burial.''

<HEADLINE> Ashes of Reuters Reporter Buried  </HEADLINE>
By AIDA CERKEZ-ROBINSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) -- Friends gathered Wednesday
at Sarajevo's wartime cemetery to bury the ashes of Reuters
correspondent Kurt Schork, who was killed on assignment in Sierra
Leone.
</P>
<P>
   Schork's friends and former colleagues from the Bosnian capital
gathered at the graveside for the simple ceremony, held to the tune
of Dire Straits' ''Brothers in Arms.'' His sister Lisa Stone and
his girlfriend, Sabina Cosic -- a native of Sarajevo -- were among
those at the burial.
</P>
<P>
   Part of Schork's ashes were buried in Washington, his hometown,
and the rest were interred at Sarajevo's most famous wartime
cemetery, called Lion.
</P>
<P>
   Schork's ashes were buried next to Almira and Bosko, a Muslim
girl and a Serb young man who were shot at a Sarajevo front-line
while trying to escape the siege. They died in an embrace and
became known as Romeo and Juliet. Schork covered their story, which
had a deep effect on him.
</P>
<P>
   ''This city brought out the best of him as a journalist and as a
human being,'' said Schork's colleague, Sean Maguire. ''Kurt's
trips always brought him back to Sarajevo and this is where he will
now stay.''
</P>
<P>
   Schork, 53, and Miguel Gil Moreno de Mora, 32, a cameraman for
Associated Press Television News, were killed in a May 24 rebel
ambush in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   Schork had spent more than 10 years reporting on conflicts
around the world, especially in the former Yugoslavia, Afghanistan
and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Gil Moreno de Mora was buried May 27 in his hometown of Vimbodi,
in eastern Spain. In June, the Bosnian government awarded
posthumous Bosnian citizenship to both Gil Moreno de Mora and
Schork.

<HEADLINE> Floods Submerge Indian Villages  </HEADLINE>
By DEEPAK SHARMA
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHANDIGARH, India (AP) -- Torrential downpours in Tibet sent a
river surging over its banks in neighboring India, washing away
1,000 houses and drowning at least 107 people, an official said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Rescuers, hampered by two days of rain and the loss of their
mules in the floods, feared many more bodies would be found in the
mountain gorges when the water subsides, said Subash Negi, the
highest official in Himachal Pradesh state.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty bridges were damaged by the rain and flooding along a
180-mile stretch of the Sutlej River, said B.D. Sharma, the state
press secretary. Details were sketchy because telephone lines were
damaged in many places.
</P>
<P>
   He said property worth $238 million was damaged, according to
preliminary estimates, including apple orchards, rice paddies,
phone lines, roads, hotels and tourist offices.
</P>
<P>
   Himachal Pradesh is popular among Western tourists for its
numerous trekking routes. It was not immediately known if any
foreigners were killed or injured.
</P>
<P>
   Rescue workers managed to evacuate 300 workers trapped at one
power company facility and 20 workers at another facility, Negi
said.
</P>
<P>
   The flooding was caused by a sudden torrential downpour in
Tibet, officials said. Pritipal Singh, a soldier who was among 15
people rescued by an air force helicopter from an army base, said
he was caught by surprise by the rain.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was a lot of rain and water entered into our house,'' he
said. ''I tried to open the door. There was six feet of water and
it gushed in. I grabbed my son and wife and ran out.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The army houses were all destroyed,'' said T.V. Kulkarni, the
helicopter's pilot. ''The survivors had clambered up to heights and
were still standing in ankle deep water.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I couldn't see the roads in the area. The houses were all
submerged or destroyed. The helipad was itself damaged and full of
water,'' he said. ''It was a problem even to land. And after I
landed, the land along the river began to slide. I couldn't see any
human beings there.''
</P>
<P>
   The state's chief minister, Prem Kumar Dhumal, said he was
trying to clear the roads so trucks with crates of apples could
drive down to the plains. Apples and tourism are the main sources
of revenue for the state.
</P>
<P>
   Dhumal also telephoned Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari
Vajpayee, urging him to send emergency funds to repair roads and
restore telecommunication links as well as extra soldiers to rescue
people trapped in villages.
</P>
<P>
   A similar cloudburst in August 1996 in Kinnaur district left at
least 200 people dead and destroyed two villages.

<HEADLINE> Troops Block Traffic in Chechnya  </HEADLINE>
By LYOMA TURPALOV
<TEXT>
<P>
   GROZNY, Russia (AP) -- Backhoes manned by Russian troops chewed
deep trenches across the streets of Chechnya's capital on Wednesday
as part of extensive preparations aimed at frustrating car bomb
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Russian commanders suspect rebels may launch a wave of attacks
on or about Sunday, which Chechens consider their independence day.
</P>
<P>
   Although the ruined streets of Grozny are severely potholed, the
backhoes have hacked at all but the main boulevards for two days to
make them more impassable.
</P>
<P>
   The military also has tightened security by building an
extensive network of temporary checkpoints, so close together that
none of the checkpoints are out of sight of others.
</P>
<P>
   Rebels used trucks in a series of deadly vehicle bombings last
month and truck traffic into Grozny now has been banned.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday is the four-year anniversary of Chechen rebels retaking
the city from Russian forces, the decisive move of the 1994-96 war
that ended with Russian troops withdrawing.
</P>
<P>
   In that battle, rebels stormed into Grozny using sewers and
backstreets, surrounding about 5,000 Russian soldiers and leaving
them without water.
</P>
<P>
   Russian troops re-entered Chechnya last September, and rebels
fled Grozny en masse in early February. But rebel bombings and
hit-and-run attacks continue in the city, as well as elsewhere in
the republic.
</P>
<P>
   A fistfight erupted on a city street Wednesday between two
factions of Chechens loyal to Moscow, all in uniform of a
pro-Russian police force. The brawl ended with a shootout in which
one man was shot dead.
</P>
<P>
   Russian soldiers at a military checkpoint about 20 yards away
watched -- but did not interfere -- in the dispute, which underscored
the tensions within the Kremlin-backed Chechen administration.
</P>
<P>
   This government is also targeted almost daily by rebel
assassins.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday a bomb ripped through the car of a bureaucrat in
charge of agriculture in the Urus-Martan region about 12 miles
southwest of Grozny.
</P>
<P>
   The bomb detonated as Movsar Shamsayev stepped out of his car,
killing him instantly, an official with the pro-Moscow
administration, speaking on condition of anonymity, told The
Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   In another sign of Russia's difficulty in establishing civilian
rule, a Russian-sponsored scholarship program appeared to unravel
this week as the roadblocks prevented students from attending
exams.
</P>
<P>
   Professors came to administer the tests, which will choose 320
Chechens to study at Russian universities, but found the military
unwilling to open the roads.
</P>
<P>
   ''I should fulfill my duty to choose 320 students... but I don't
know how to do it,'' said Movsur Ibragimov, a professor at Moscow's
Pedagogical University.
</P>
<P>
   The current war began after Chechnya-based rebels twice raided
the neighboring republic of Dagestan a year ago. Russia also blames
Chechen rebels for apartment bombings that killed about 300 people
last year.
</P>
<P>
   President Vladimir Putin, speaking Wednesday at a ceremony for
Russian paratroopers killed in Chechnya, said that military
campaign in Chechnya helped keep Russia from breaking up.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our decisive actions ... have prevented the process of the
collapse of the state from beginning,'' Putin said.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Invasion Shock NATO  </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY ULBRICH
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- All seemed well in the world on that
quiet day 10 years ago -- the Berlin wall had fallen, Moscow's
attitude was thawing and optimism was high. Then, in the middle of
the night, NATO ambassadors were roused from their sleep and called
into emergency session.
</P>
<P>
   Saddam Hussein's troops had invaded Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   NATO was not directly involved, of course -- Kuwait was out of
its territory. But the atmosphere at that Aug. 2, 1990, session of
the alliance's top policymaking body was electric. Something
dramatic was happening. And it had caught everyone by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was the first time since World War II that one country had
gobbled up another then declared that country didn't exist
anymore,'' said NATO spokesman Jamie Shea, at the time a
speechwriter for Secretary-General Manfred Woerner.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was not just a Middle East crisis, but a real test of
principle, the sovereignty of states.''
</P>
<P>
   The invasion, which was over in a matter of hours, was a shock
to the NATO alliance. Intelligence had not predicted it. The
enormity of the situation, its impact on the rest of the Middle
East and its threat to a huge chunk of the world's oil reserves was
of deep concern to all the allies.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, five NATO members became direct participants -- the
United States, France, Britain, Canada and Italy. Others had a
peripheral role -- Norway provided shipping, Germany gave
anti-chemical warfare equipment and cash, along with nonmembers
like Japan and Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   This meant, among other things, that some of the forces used to
provide the collective defense of the allied nations, which then
numbered 16, had to be diverted to the Middle East. That in turn
meant gaps had to be plugged back in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   That early morning session of the NATO council was the first of
what became daily meetings to monitor the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   NATO became the forum for organizing the evacuation of foreign
nationals from Kuwait. It is also where the sanctions policy
against Iraq was coordinated. Fuel and transport for the Gulf
forces were arranged here.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most important roles of the alliance, however, was
maintaining the united diplomatic front against Iraq, condemning
President Saddam Hussein and issuing statements about Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   The atmosphere was grim. The mood of optimism that had been
growing with the end of the Cold War collapsed. It was also a
strategic shock because it wasn't predicted. Until then, the focus
of concern had been Iran. Iraq had been viewed as the bulwark
against Islamic fundamentalism.
</P>
<P>
   NATO found itself in a delicate position. Though it saw the
threat to Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states as a global crisis, it
couldn't enter the fray under the NATO flag. The Arab world was
extremely suspicious of NATO, experts say, and it is conceivable
Egypt or Syria might have declined to join the coalition.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the Gulf War taught the alliance important
lessons that were to prove useful in later years in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   The Persian Gulf War was the first time NATO had to engage in a
crisis outside its traditional zone and not connected to
territorial defense, even if that involvement was essentially
support and coordination. The Gulf conflict made it clear that
collective defense is one thing, but that the alliance must also be
diplomatically active and able to put together coalitions of the
willing.
</P>
<P>
   Those lessons were invaluable in Bosnia and Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> Racetrack importing feed as rain ruins hay  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. (AP) - An unseasonably rainy summer has
hurt the quality of local hay and is forcing Saratoga Race Course
to buy from western states and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The shortage has increased the price of hay for race track
officials to feed its thoroughbreds as well as for dairy farmers
who require hay with more protein.
</P>
<P>
   ''We buy hay from all over: Washington state, Idaho state,
Canada and whatever we can get out of New York,'' said Margaret
Pitney, owner of Thoro-Bred Feed and Supply in Saratoga Springs.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of local farmers can't cut their hay - it's too wet,''
she said. ''It's gone up a little because of demand ... for decent
hay.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitney estimated the price increased $10 to $15 per ton.
</P>
<P>
   The price of hay harvested in New York has decreased from $102
per ton in May 1999 to $92 per ton this May, according to Muriel
Church, assistant director of communications for the Department of
Agriculture and Markets.
</P>
<P>
   Church said the lower quality of the hay was directly related to
the dropping price.
</P>
<P>
   The price of hay from outside New York, has risen because the
demand is higher, although there is not a set price.
</P>
<P>
   ''We pay about 12 cents a pound now for our hay, which would
normally be about 8 cents a pound now, but this year it's harder to
get,'' Rod Kosiczky of Triple Star Feed said.
</P>
<P>
   The difference in the price of high quality hay comes to $88 per
ton. At about 45 bales per ton, the increase comes to almost $4
more per bale.
</P>
<P>
   Paul McDowell, assistant manager of governmental affairs at the
state Farm Bureau, said the high-quality hay has special nutrients.
</P>
<P>
   ''If it's rained on while cut, it loses nutrients, and it's only
useful for bedding,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   McDowell said there are generally three hay cuttings per season.
Because the second two are all fresh hay, they are the most
nutritious. However, if the first cut is delayed or cannot be made
at all, only half of the harvest is fresh instead of the usual
two-thirds.
</P>
<P>
   The thoroughbreds are not the only ones in need of the nutrition
supplements. Dairy farmers have also been paying more to feed their
cows.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Titus, farm manager of Barbland Farms Incorporated in
Fabius, New York, said, ''It's been nasty. We've got about 300 tons
of hay that's been wet on the ground for so long it's rotting in
the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Titus said that while some hay is still useable, the quality is
worse. They have already supplemented protein with soy, costlier
than hay, and the farm might have to look elsewhere for the hay
they need.
</P>
<P>
   ''The overall quality is lower and the tonnage is lower,'' he
said. ''With the dry season out west, we may have to buy more hay
out there, which will drive prices up more.''
</P>
<P>
   Titus estimated the farm's profit will drop 3 to 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers and trainers also say the flavor of the hay cut late is
different as well.
</P>
<P>
   ''As one farmer told me once, 'It's just tastier fresh,'''
McDowell said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Medical centers that perform heart, liver and
lung transplants for only one year can serve Medicare patients
under revised federal standards issued Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, transplant programs had to perform procedures on
patients not entitled to Medicare for two years before applying for
government benefits, said Nancy-Ann DeParle, head of the Health
Care Financing Administration, the Health and Human Resources
agency that administers Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Recent studies conclude that the number of transplants performed
by a center is more important in predicting successful surgeries
than the number of years of experience, DeParle said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Transplant centers still must meet other Medicare standards
including those concerning patient selection policies, facility
resources and survival rates.

<HEADLINE> WHO Accuses Tobacco Companies  </HEADLINE>
By GEIR MOULSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA (AP) -- The World Health Organization accused big tobacco
companies Wednesday of waging a covert campaign to subvert its
efforts to reduce smoking, and warned the companies may now try to
undermine work on a new global anti-smoking accord.
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco companies Phillip Morris and British American Tobacco
denied the WHO accusations, saying their past activities were
misrepresented and that they now hope to work constructively with
the U.N. health agency.
</P>
<P>
   Swiss health official Thomas Zeltner, who headed a WHO expert
panel on the issue, said ''the evidence shows that tobacco
companies have operated for many years with the deliberate purpose
of subverting the efforts of WHO to control tobacco.''
</P>
<P>
   The WHO report accused the companies of influencing or placing
consultants at WHO, who did not declare their links.
</P>
<P>
   It said they used other U.N. agencies -- notably the Food and
Agriculture Organization -- to acquire information on WHO and tried
''well into the 1990s'' to persuade delegates from developing
countries to resist anti-tobacco resolutions.
</P>
<P>
   ''The attempted subversion has been elaborate, well financed,
sophisticated and usually invisible,'' Zeltner said.
</P>
<P>
   The report said tobacco companies funded ''independent'' experts
to conduct research, appear at conferences and lobby WHO scientists
with the intention of distorting, discrediting or influencing
studies.
</P>
<P>
   The four-member panel studied the companies' own documents, made
public during a case brought by the state of Minnesota. The
documents concerned Philip Morris, BAT, R.J. Reynolds, Brown and
Williamson, American Tobacco Company, Lorillard Tobacco Company,
the Tobacco Institute and the Council for Tobacco Research.
</P>
<P>
   The tobacco companies' activities ''slowed and undermined
effective tobacco control programs around the world,'' the
researchers said.
</P>
<P>
   The report highlighted a 1988 meeting of Philip Morris
executives at Boca Raton, Fla., which it said drew up an ''action
plan'' to attack WHO and its tobacco control programs.
</P>
<P>
   WHO estimates that smoking kills more than 4 million people per
year and says the toll may rise to 10 million per year by 2030
because of surging tobacco use in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
   The report urged WHO to monitor the tobacco companies' future
conduct as the agency starts work on a global accord to cut
cigarette consumption and stem the rising death toll.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the evidence against the tobacco industry predates the
current push, Zeltner conceded, but ''it is likely that tobacco
companies will attempt to defeat the proposed convention ... or to
transform the proposal into a vehicle for weakening national
tobacco control initiatives.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Such a campaign is likely to be sophisticated and sustained,''
he added.
</P>
<P>
   British American Tobacco said the report ''misrepresents the
tobacco industry's legitimate lobbying activity.''
</P>
<P>
   With tobacco companies excluded from policymaking, ''it is only
natural and perfectly legitimate for BAT and others to seek to
bring more information, sometimes through third parties, to the
important debates that take place within the WHO,'' it said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   It challenged the claim that tobacco industry distorted a 1998
report on the effects of passive smoking, which it said ''quite
simply failed to demonstrate any statistically significant increase
in nonsmokers' risks.''
</P>
<P>
   Philip Morris said ''inferences of improper influence are not
accurate,'' although it said some documents reflect an approach it
would not now take toward WHO.
</P>
<P>
   ''While many of these documents reflect adversarial positions
and often confrontational attitudes on both sides, we do not
believe that they substantiate a conclusion that Philip Morris
obstructed WHO's health messages about tobacco or its tobacco
control initiatives,'' company vice president David Davies said.

<HEADLINE> Virus likely to spread, expert says  </HEADLINE>
By NATASHA GURAL
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAMDEN, Conn. (AP) - The potentially deadly West Nile virus is
likely to spread throughout the state and even across New England
before the summer is over, a Connecticut scientist said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''By no stretch of the imagination are we out of the woods,''
said Theodore Andreadis, chief entomologist for the Connecticut
Agricultural Experiment Station. ''It is quite possible we will see
a human case, if not in Connecticut, in New York, before the
summer's over.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday a West Nile authority from the national Centers for
Disease Control in Atlanta told New Yorkers that the mosquito-borne
virus could spread into other areas of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of people gathered under a tent Wednesday to hear
Andreadis speak about the virus during the station's annual open
house.
</P>
<P>
   ''I spend a lot of time outdoors, so I'm concerned,'' said
Paulette Leto of West Haven. ''I don't think we can overlook it.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Leto said she has confidence in the state's efforts to
fight the virus.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know they're on top of it as much as they can be,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   No new cases of the virus were been found in the latest tests on
mosquitoes and birds in Connecticut released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The virus was detected in mosquitoes collected from a Stamford
park on July 11. Tests on a crow found in a Stamford yard on July
23 - about a mile from where the mosquitoes were found - also
turned up positive for the virus.
</P>
<P>
   Andreadis said Wednesday that knowing where the dead birds are
found is important. Four or five days before a crow dies it becomes
very ill and does not move much, making it a feast for mosquitoes
in that area.
</P>
<P>
   In the most recent round of testing, 10,253 mosquitoes from 43
sites across the state tested negative.
</P>
<P>
   The virus first surfaced in the region last year, killing seven
people - all of whom were over 75 - and sickening 62 others in New
York. It killed hundreds of birds in Connecticut, New York and New
Jersey. Last month an infected bird was found in Massachusetts for
the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ''As ominous are these statistics are, what is more scary is
that it has survived the winter,'' said Andreadis.
</P>
<P>
   No human cases have been reported this year.
</P>
<P>
   Most people who contract the disease experience flu-like
symptoms and never realize they have been exposed to the virus. New
York is the only area were muscle weakness is also a symptom, said
Andreadis.
</P>
<P>
   The virus is one possible cause of the potentially fatal disease
encephalitis, an inflammation of the brain. So far this year, 13
cases of encephalitis have been reported in Connecticut. No
evidence of West Nile infection has been found in 12 of those
cases; test results are pending on one case.
</P>
<P>
   Based on genetic analysis of the isolated cases in Connecticut,
the virus originated from the Middle East or Mediterranean area,
most likely Israel, Andreadis said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We still to this day don't know how it was introduced,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut this year doubled its efforts to trap mosquitoes,
setting up two different types of traps weekly at 73 sites around
the state.
</P>
<P>
   The state sprayed pesticide last week in sections of Stamford,
Darien and New Canaan after the infected mosquitoes were found.

<HEADLINE> A weird summer in Toms River: No Little Leaguers headed for title  </HEADLINE>
By WAYNE PARRY
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOMS RIVER, N.J. (AP) - George Bell is painting his house this
week. That otherwise unremarkable fact is worth noting here, where
the powerhouse Toms River East Little League team that reached the
World Series in three out of the last five years was eliminated in
the first round of the playoffs this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Bell, a postal carrier who coached this year's team, said the
kids were under enormous pressure to repeat the successes of their
predecessors. The players said they did the best they could, but
for some in this Jersey shore bedroom community that has become
accustomed to nearly annual trips to Williamsport, Pa., for the
championship round, it was not good enough.
</P>
<P>
   ''The parents were a little disappointed,'' said Bell. ''Without
a doubt, when you win and you have success like we've had for the
last five years, and it doesn't happen one year, right away they
blame the coach. I did everything I could, and so did the kids.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have so much pressure at this age,'' he said. ''They're
only 12-year-old kids. Everybody wants to go to Williamsport, and I
was under a lot of pressure because I was the first coach after
Mike Gaynor.''
</P>
<P>
   Gaynor won the hearts of Toms River and much of the nation by
leading his Little Leaguers to the World Series in 1995, 1998 (when
they beat Kashima, Japan for the world title), and last year, when
they lost the national championship to Phenix City, Ala. He stepped
down after last season to spend more time running his shoe stores
and coaching Pop Warner football.
</P>
<P>
   That left it to Bell and an entirely new roster of players to
try to match the successes of past Toms River East teams. But they
soon found that playing here can sometimes be like playing for New
York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner, who expects nothing less
than a world championship every year.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can't do it every year,'' said league official John
Karkovice as he trimmed the grass on one of Toms River East's seven
vacant diamonds Wednesday. ''Maybe it might be a little relief,
take the pressure off a little. But next year, I think it'll be the
same.''
</P>
<P>
   Karkovice, whose kid brother, Ron, was the Chicago White Sox
catcher from 1986 to 1997, said people need to realize how
remarkable it was for a team to reach the championship in three out
of five years.
</P>
<P>
   The way Toms River East lost this year was surprising. Two weeks
ago, in the very first tournament game, the team suffered a
devastating setback. Up 10-1 in the fifth inning, Bell decided to
lift ace pitcher Tom Carlucci because he'd hurt his shoulder a few
days earlier.
</P>
<P>
   But a succession of relievers coughed up the lead, and an inning
later Toms River East had lost 11-10 to their crosstown rivals,
Toms River. A few games later, they were out, done, finished. No
trip to Williamsport. No rides atop a fire truck or parades down
Route 37. No visits to the White House or Rosie O'Donnell's TV
show. No highlights on ESPN, and no more baseball to play with more
than a month of summer left.
</P>
<P>
   When it was over, Carlucci broke down and wept in his coach's
arms.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was crying like you wouldn't believe,'' Bell said. ''I
started to hug him and I said, 'Tom, you did everything you could,
but it's not a one-man team. You'll go on from here and do fine.'''
</P>
<P>
   Then he hugged me back and said, 'Thanks for being my coach.'
That's when you realize what it's all about.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I was disappointed,'' Carlucci said. ''I thought we had a
pretty good team. Certain things just didn't go our way. But now
that it's over with, it's OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortstop Chuck Cerami-Nucci said it took him about a week to
get over his disappointment, throwing himself into daily Pop Warner
football practices and making an occasional trip to the beach or
the neighbors' pool.
</P>
<P>
   ''We thought we were the best team in the tournament, and we
didn't expect to lose any of those games,'' he said. ''But nothing
went our way. We all pictured ourselves playing on TV at
Williamsport. But it was tough to accomplish what the teams before
us did.''
</P>
<P>
   Mugsy's, the local tavern where hundreds of fans gathered to
watch past Toms River East teams fight for the title, is a little
emptier this August. But owner Anthony Baiamonte said the community
is still proud of this year's team.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll still treat them like champions,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Concorde Investigation Continues  </HEADLINE>
By PAMELA SAMPSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- Investigators removed two engines from the Concorde
crash site Wednesday in hopes the wreckage of the Air France
supersonic jet will help determine the cause of the disaster that
killed 113 people.
</P>
<P>
   Some 100 technicians transported the wreckage to a site at Dugny
near Le Bourget airport, north of Paris, where it will be examined.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every detail and every placement of the pieces is possibly
crucial,'' said Xavier Mulot, head of Concorde 95, an investigatory
team set up to establish the legal responsibility for the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-four members of the French national police and three
judicial experts are participating in the inquiry. They have taken
statements from 295 witnesses of the crash, Mulot said.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the inquiry into the July 25 crash, investigators
also summoned technical experts from a U.S. tire manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co., the world's largest maker of
aircraft tires and the only tire supplier for the Air France
Concorde fleet, sent two specialists to France on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were asked to supply technical assistance to the
investigation,'' company spokesman Chris Aked said Tuesday from
Goodyear headquarters in Akron, Ohio. ''We sent two aircraft tire
engineers ... and they are now working with the investigation
team.''
</P>
<P>
   Aked said he had no information about the cause of the crash or
whether a tire malfunction was involved.
</P>
<P>
   There is evidence that one or two of the Concorde's tires
exploded and one of the plane's engines shut down, followed by the
partial shutdown of another engine.
</P>
<P>
   France's Accident and Inquiry Office has said flames spewing
from the side of the aircraft before it crashed most likely came
from a major fuel leak.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, French authorities decided to keep its fleet of
Concordes grounded while investigators try to recreate the events
that caused the crash near Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Air France grounded its remaining five Concordes immediately
after the crash. The world's other seven Concordes, owned by
British Airways, resumed most flights after a day's pause.

<HEADLINE> Blue-Chip Stocks Close Higher  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Blue-chip stocks moved higher Wednesday,
rallying in the wake of more encouraging news that left investors
optimistic the economy is indeed slowing down.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 80.58 at 10,687.53,
according to preliminary figures.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 3.71 at 1,441.81 but the
Nasdaq composite index gave back some earlier gains and closed down
17.14 at 3,668.38.
</P>
<P>
   Interest rate sensitive Dow stocks surged after the Conference
Board reported that its leading economic indicators were unchanged
in June.
</P>
<P>
   ''The rally came right after the numbers were released and the
feeling is that there's a relatively good chance that the Fed's not
going to do anything'' at its next meeting Aug. 22, said Tom
Gallagher, head of U.S. equity markets for CIBC World Markets in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   Banking stocks benefited on the belief that lending and
underwriting activity of stocks and bonds will stay healthy if
interest rates remain stable based on the positive economic
indicators. Lehman Brothers rose $5.75 to $118.50, and Merrill
Lynch rose $1.75 to $127.
</P>
<P>
   An important gauge of future economic activity, the Index of
Leading Economic Indicators held steady at 106 in June. If the
forecast is accurate, the numbers would mean a break from rapid
economic growth for the rest of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the government reported that U.S. home sales
declined in June to their lowest level in two and a half years.
</P>
<P>
   But on the Nasdaq a handful of widely held stocks, including
Cisco Systems and Dell Computer, fell on fears that revenues may
decline in the second half of 2000. Cisco fell $2.25 to $60.938,
and Dell lost $2 to $39.563.
</P>
<P>
   Those long-range fears helped helped down the broader technology
sector.
</P>
<P>
   Some lesser known technology stocks surged, however, after
reporting better-than-expected second-quarter earnings. For
example, technology consulting company Sapient Corp. rose $16.938
to $120.813 after reporting second-quarter earnings of 23 cents a
share, excluding one-time expenditures. The figure beat analyst
expectations by 3 cents. In addition, the company announced a
two-for-one stock split.
</P>
<P>
   And Protein Design Labs rose $15.141 to $147.75 after reporting
earnings of 23 cents a share, beating analysts' predictions of 18
cents.
</P>
<P>
   Investors viewed both economic reports as signs that the Federal
Reserve Board's strategy of raising interest rates during the past
year has been successful.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, three other reports also indicated that the economy
is easing after a decade of explosive growth. If so, the Fed may
leave rates stable at their next meeting Aug. 22, which would
benefit the interest rate sensitive Dow Jones industrial stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues were ahead of decliners by a 5 to 4 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 983.05 million
shares, ahead of Tuesday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was up 2.00 at 499.77.

<HEADLINE> Minister, civic activist pleads innocent to prostitution charges  </HEADLINE>
By JUDITH FORMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - A Hartford minister and civic activist
pleaded innocent Wednesday to charges that he pimped women at a
Meriden massage parlor and assaulted a prostitute allegedly
pregnant with his baby.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Henry Price is charged with one count of first-degree
promoting prostitution, two counts of second-degree promoting
prostitution and one count of third-degree assault. Police say
prostitutes told them Price demanded sexual favors from them, got
them jobs at the massage parlor and took much of the money they
earned as prostitutes.
</P>
<P>
   According to arrest warrant affidavits released Wednesday, the
48-year-old Price lured the women - in some cases, under the guise
of counseling them - into working at the Garden of Eden massage
parlor.
</P>
<P>
   Price allegedly told one woman who resisted working for him that
''she was nothing but a 'ho' and she was never going to amount to
anything,'' according to one affidavit.
</P>
<P>
   The affidavits also allege that Price assaulted a pregnant,
29-year-old prostitute who would not have an abortion. The woman
told police that Price was the father and that when she informed
him he tried to ''beat the baby out of her.''
</P>
<P>
   First-degree promoting prostitution involves the use of force or
intimidation to get someone to engage in prostitution.
Second-degree promotion of prostitution involves managing or
supervising a prostitution business.
</P>
<P>
   Price left the courthouse Wednesday without comment. He is
scheduled to return to court Aug. 15.
</P>
<P>
   Price supporter Prenzina Holloway said she feels ''from the
bottom of my heart'' that the charges are untrue.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's a wonderful person in the community,'' Holloway said.
''He came too far to turn back.''
</P>
<P>
   Price is a well-known community activist and a vocal critic of
the Hartford Police Department. He was convicted in 1984 of fatally
shooting a drug dealer who sold him bad cocaine and sentenced to 40
years in prison; he was pardoned in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Price helped organize protests that followed the shooting of a
14-year-old mugging suspect, Aquan Salmon, by Hartford police
Officer Robert Allan in April 1999. Price has also led
demonstrations since the officer was cleared of wrongdoing by the
department.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors, defense lawyers and a lawyer for The Hartford
Courant argued whether the affidavits should be released.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant State's Attorney Victor Carlucci said the documents
should remain sealed because the case is still under investigation,
and because witnesses in the case might be at risk for harm or
intimidation.
</P>
<P>
   Price's lawyer, Salvatore Bonanno, was neutral on releasing the
documents to the public but said he had not seen them himself.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm getting my facts from the Courant,'' he said. ''Prior to
today, I haven't been able to do any homework.''
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Elliot, the newspaper's lawyer, said everyone should have
access to the affidavit.
</P>
<P>
   ''The public has a right to know,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Superior Judge Robert E. Beach Jr. ruled there was no evidence
that releasing the affidavits would put anyone at risk.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Up 81; Nasdaq Is Down 17  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Blue chip stocks moved higher Wednesday,
rallying in the wake of more encouraging news that left investors
optimistic the economy is indeed slowing down.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 80.58 at 10,687.53,
according to preliminary figures.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 3.71 at 1,441.81 but the
Nasdaq composite index gave back some earlier gains and closed down
17.14 at 3,668.38.
</P>
<P>
   Interest rate sensitive Dow stocks surged after the Conference
Board reported that its leading economic indicators were unchanged
in June.
</P>
<P>
   ''The rally came right after the numbers were released and the
feeling is that there's a relatively good chance that the Fed's not
going to do anything'' at its next meeting Aug. 22, said Tom
Gallagher, head of U.S. equity markets for CIBC World Markets in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   Banking stocks benefited on the belief that lending and
underwriting activity of stocks and bonds will stay healthy if
interest rates remain stable based on the positive economic
indicators. Lehman Brothers rose $5.75 to $118.50, and Merrill
Lynch rose $1.75 to $127.
</P>
<P>
   An important gauge of future economic activity, the Index of
Leading Economic Indicators held steady at 106 in June. If the
forecast is accurate, the numbers would mean a break from rapid
economic growth for the rest of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the government reported that U.S. home sales
declined in June to their lowest level in two and a half years.
</P>
<P>
   But on the Nasdaq a handful of widely held stocks, including
Cisco Systems and Dell Computer, fell on fears that revenues may
decline in the second half of 2000. Cisco fell $2.25 to $60.938,
and Dell lost $2 to $39.563.
</P>
<P>
   Those long-range fears helped helped down the broader technology
sector.
</P>
<P>
   Some lesser known technology stocks surged, however, after
reporting better-than-expected second-quarter earnings. For
example, technology consulting company Sapient Corp. rose $16.938
to $120.813 after reporting second-quarter earnings of 23 cents a
share, excluding one-time expenditures. The figure beat analyst
expectations by 3 cents. In addition, the company announced a
two-for-one stock split.
</P>
<P>
   And Protein Design Labs rose $15.141 to $147.75 after reporting
earnings of 23 cents a share, beating analysts' predictions of 18
cents.
</P>
<P>
   Investors viewed both economic reports as signs that the Federal
Reserve Board's strategy of raising interest rates during the past
year has been successful.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, three other reports also indicated that the economy
is easing after a decade of explosive growth. If so, the Fed may
leave rates stable at their next meeting Aug. 22, which would
benefit the interest rate sensitive Dow Jones industrial stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues were ahead of decliners by a 5 to 4 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 983.05 million
shares, ahead of Tuesday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was up 2.00 at 499.77.

<HEADLINE> Giuliani talks briefly about cancer treatment  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - Mayor Rudolph Giuliani was uncharacteristically
open with Tom Brokaw during an interview at the Republican National
Convention, admitting to the NBC anchor he has undergone hormone
treatment for prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani made the disclosure Tuesday night while talking with
Brokaw in Philadelphia. It was the first time the mayor has said
what kind of treatment he is undergoing since being diagnosed with
prostate cancer in May.
</P>
<P>
   ''It kind of slipped - probably because a lot of people at the
convention asked me what I was doing,'' Giuliani said Wednesday.
''I told so many people, I thought I might as well tell Tom
Brokaw.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the Daily News cited unidentified sources saying
Giuliani was receiving hormone therapy while trying to decide on a
final treatment. The newspaper said the mayor was being treated
with Lupron - a medication that blocks the production of
testosterone.
</P>
<P>
   While Lupron and other hormone blockers do not cure prostate
cancer, they can buy time for patients who want to evaluate
different therapies. The blockers are sometimes used before surgery
or radiation to shrink the prostate and reduce prostate specific
antigen, or PSA, levels.
</P>
<P>
   Lupron's most common side effects are hot flashes and impotence.
Injections of the drug, which are administered monthly or
quarterly, can hold the cancer at bay for years, doctors say.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has repeatedly refused to answer most questions about
his health since dropping out of the U.S. Senate race against first
lady Hillary Rodham Clinton on May 19. He has told reporters he
will inform the public of his decision on a cancer treatment only
when he feels comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor did not say anything further on Wednesday about his
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Cancer of the prostate, a gland involved in semen production, is
the second most common type of cancer found in American men.

<HEADLINE> Study Looks At Ulcer Drug  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   High doses of a top-selling ulcer drug can reduce the
risk of
further bleeding after bleeding ulcers are treated, a study shows.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bleeding ulcers can be effectively treated with an endoscope -- a
long narrow tube inserted in the stomach to burn the ulcer. But 15
to 20 percent of patients have renewed bleeding.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers found that administering high doses of the ulcer
drug Prilosec after endoscopic treatment reduced the rate of repeat
bleeding. It also reduced the need for blood transfusions and
another endoscopic treatment and cut hospital stays.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers at Chinese University of Hong Kong studied 240
patients with bleeding ulcers who had endoscopic treatment in 1998
and 1999. The study, funded by the Hong Kong government, was
reported in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   After the treatment, half of the patients received high doses of
Prilosec intravenously for three days. The other half received a
placebo. For the next eight weeks, they all received the standard
pill dose of Prilosec, which suppresses stomach acid.
</P>
<P>
   In the high-dose group, 7 percent had another bout of bleeding
during the first month after treatment; 23 percent of the placebo
group had recurring bleeding.
</P>
<P>
   Prilosec is the brand name for omeprazole, which is known
outside the United States as Losec.
</P>
<P>
   In an accompanying editorial, Dr. Eric D. Libby of the New
England Medical Center said bleeding ulcers remain a common reason
for hospitalization despite advances in treatment over the last
three decades. He noted that Prilosec is not yet available for
intravenous use in the United States and the effectiveness of oral
Prilosec to prevent repeat bleeding hasn't been tested.

<HEADLINE> Study: Inhaled Steroids Save Lives  </HEADLINE>
By STEPHANIE NANO
<TEXT>
<P>
   Asthma sufferers who regularly use steroid inhalers to ease
their breathing problems also lower their risk of dying from the
disease, a large new study concludes.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors have been uncertain until now whether treating asthma
with inhaled steroids actually saves lives.
</P>
<P>
   Inhaled steroids are widely used to treat asthma. They reduce
the inflammation that causes airways to contract and clog and make
breathing difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Over time, they make the airways less sensitive to the pollen,
smoke or other things that trigger asthma attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ''Physicians have known all along that these medications are
very effective. Now with this new data, they know that they can
actually save the lives of their patients,'' said Samy Suissa of
McGill University in Montreal, one of the researchers whose study
was reported in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   About 17.3 million Americans suffer from asthma, and about 5,400
people die from the disease each year, according to the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   The study looked at medical records for 30,569 people who were
treated for asthma in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan between
1975 and 1991 and followed them until 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers compared inhaled steroid use among 66 who died
with that among 2,681 asthma patients who survived. Those in the
comparison group averaged one-third more inhaled steroids a year
than those who died.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers calculated that the rate of death from asthma
decreased by 21 percent with each additional canister of inhaled
steroids used during the year.
</P>
<P>
   Suissa said inhaled steroids are most effective if patients use
about six canisters a year. Those who died averaged just over one a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Suissa noted that the benefits were achieved with low-dose
inhaled steroids. He said Americans are particularly wary of
inhaled steroids because of the possible side effects, such as
stunted growth in children, osteoporosis, glaucoma and cataracts.
</P>
<P>
   ''Clearly the doses we're talking about, there is no evidence of
any significant side effects at all,'' Suissa said.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers also warned that regular use is important. The study
showed that patients who stopped using inhaled steroids were five
times more likely to die of asthma than those who continued to use
them regularly.
</P>
<P>
   The study did not look at another inhaler -- bronchodilators --
used by asthma sufferers to quickly open airways during sudden
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Norman H. Edelman of the American Lung Association said the
study conveys an important message. Despite recommendations for
their use, ''it's generally agreed that we still underuse inhalant
steroids in patients with asthma,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The study was funded by the Medical Research Council of Canada
and several drug companies. Suissa is a consultant to one of the
companies, Boehringer Ingelheim.

<HEADLINE> FDA Completes Sterilizing Standard  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government completed new standards
Wednesday to ensure that disposable medical devices are safely
resterilized and rehabilitated before being reused.
</P>
<P>
   Recycling devices like cardiac catheters and angioplasty
balloons, intended to be used once and thrown in the trash, is a
growing but controversial medical practice that largely has gone
unregulated.
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration's own research has uncovered
problems with some reused disposable devices, such as angioplasty
balloons stretched out of shape by the cleaning procedure.
</P>
<P>
   A Kansas woman is living with a piece of metal lodged inside her
heart after a reused catheter broke during surgery last year. Some
studies have concluded that a few patients caught infections like
hepatitis or pneumonia from resterilized devices.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the FDA insists the practice is not much riskier than using
standard medical equipment. Even new heart catheters occasionally
break, and many medical devices made to be used repeatedly commonly
cause infections if they're not resterilized properly.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA announced it would require hospitals and resterilizing
companies to meet standards proving they recycle safely, and
Wednesday the agency issued final guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   The toughest requirements will be for hospitals or companies
that want to resterilize high-risk devices, those that are hard to
clean or contain delicate materials that could be damaged in
sterilization. They would have to quickly seek FDA approval that
their methods are safe and effective.

<HEADLINE> GM to build new engine plant in Tonawanda  </HEADLINE>
By CAROLYN THOMPSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   TONAWANDA, N.Y. (AP) - General Motors Corp. will invest more
than $500 million to build a high-tech engine plant at its
Powertrain complex that will preserve jobs and better position the
Tonawanda facility to win future work, a GM official said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The new 711,000-square-foot engine plant will produce a
six-cylinder, all-aluminum inline engine for various GM cars and
light trucks, which GM did not identify.
</P>
<P>
   Groundbreaking is expected at the end of the year with
production to begin in 2003.
</P>
<P>
   While not expected to create jobs, the investment will protect
the 4,000 employees at what is already the country's largest engine
plant. About 600 workers will be shifted to the new line, GM said.
</P>
<P>
   The state-of-the-art plant will be equipped with ''agile
manufacturing equipment,'' which provides the flexibility to
quickly make changes in the product line, GM spokesman Dan Greene
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's significant because it allows us to look good when
future business is on the block,'' he said. ''It's very good for
job retention and job security because we will be able to change
very quickly as market conditions demand.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tonawanda site was selected over several others, largely
because of the plant's productivity and incentive packages from the
state and Erie County, Greene said. GM also applauded a labor
agreement approved by United Auto Workers Local 774 members that
allows for more flexible work rules.
</P>
<P>
   ''A key factor is the management-union relationship,'' Greene
said.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George Pataki and county Executive Joel Giambra announced
the deal at the Republican National Convention in Philadelphia,
where they learned the General Motors board of directors had
approved it Tuesday in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   The long-awaited announcement is believed to represent the
largest private-sector investment in the region since World War II
and was immediately offered as proof that the Buffalo area is still
capable of attracting big business.
</P>
<P>
   ''GM's decision sends a powerful message across the country that
western New York can compete for and win major economic development
investments because of the sweeping changes we have made to our
business climate,'' Pataki said. ''It is also a major vote of
confidence in the GM workers, who earned this victory with their
hard work.''
</P>
<P>
   Attracting new engine lines is crucial for the plant since some
of the engines it produces now will be phased out in coming years.
The complex currently makes four, six and eight-cylinder engines.
Four years ago it was awarded production of a 2.2-liter engine,
known as the L850, used in Saturn cars.
</P>
<P>
   ''From our perspective it was almost life and death'' that GM
choose Tonawanda, said Ronald Coan, chairman of the Erie County
Industrial Development Agency. The agency approved a $22.5 million
package of sales and property tax abatements for the project in
May.
</P>
<P>
   ''Manufacturing is still the backbone of the Erie County economy
and Powertrain is the backbone of manufacturing in the county,''
Coan said.
</P>
<P>
   The state came up with a $13 million incentive package which
includes a $5.25 million commitment to upgrade roadways, $500,000
to improve access to the plant and $3.5 million to upgrade water
and wastewater facilities that serve the plant. The company is also
eligible to apply for up to $2 million in Empire State Development
Corp. employee training funds.
</P>
<P>
   ESD Chairman Charles Gargano said negotiations over many months
were difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a strong economy around the country and it makes it
very competitive with other states,'' he said. ''They do have 10
other plants around where they produce engines so we were competing
with them and it's always tough.'' GM has eight plants in the
United States, two in Mexico and one in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Gargano added that although the state's expenditures are
earmarked for the plant, the infrastructure and water improvements
will benefit other businesses and residents.

<HEADLINE> Downey Jr. To Get Out of Prison  </HEADLINE>
By LINDA DEUTSCH
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- An appeals court ordered actor Robert Downey
Jr. released from prison Wednesday, ruling he had served enough
time to fulfill his three-year sentence on drug charges under
complex sentencing guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   A Department of Corrections spokeswoman said Wednesday afternoon
that Downey's release papers were being processed.
</P>
<P>
   The four-judge panel of the California Second District Court of
Appeal said that Downey was entitled to receive credit for time he
served in drug rehabilitation facilities, said Deputy Attorney
General Jeffrey Kahan.
</P>
<P>
   After Downey had served a year of his sentence, his lawyers
petitioned the appeals court, claiming that Superior Court Judge
Lawrence Mira failed to indicate whether the felony sentence would
run concurrently or consecutively with misdemeanor counts that
placed him in rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's served a year and he should have been out in February,''
attorney Ross Nabatoff told the court at a hearing last week.
''This is a sad tale.''
</P>
<P>
   Downey had already served 53 days in a drug rehab lockdown
center as part of a 15-month sentence for the misdemeanor
convictions of driving under the influence, carrying an unloaded
weapon in his car and being under the influence.
</P>
<P>
   The appellate court ordered Downey to post $5,000 bail pending
the court's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Thornton, a spokeswoman for the California Department of
Corrections, said the order was received for Downey's release and
he was being processed. Downey, 34, was jailed after he admitted
during a probation hearing that he was missing scheduled drug
tests. Mira sentenced him to three years in prison for violating
his probation.
</P>
<P>
   The son of film director Robert Downey earned an Oscar
nomination for his work in the title role in ''Chaplin,'' the 1992
screen biography of the famed comedian. Other film credits include
''Less Than Zero,'' ''Natural Born Killers,'' ''One Night Stand,''
''Two Girls and a Guy'' and ''U.S. Marshals.''
</P>
<P>
   The actor's legal troubles date to June 1996 when he was stopped
for speeding on the Pacific Coast Highway and authorities found
cocaine, heroin and a pistol in his vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   A month later he was found passed out on a child's bed in a
neighbor's home. Three days later, he was arrested for leaving a
recovery center.

<HEADLINE> Thousand mourn death of Bobov Grand Rabbi in Brooklyn  </HEADLINE>
By DEEPTI HAJELA
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Thousands of mourners gathered in Brooklyn on
Wednesday to say goodbye to Grand Rabbi Solomon Halberstam, who led
the Bobov sect out of Europe after World War II and oversaw its
rebirth.
</P>
<P>
   The 92-year-old head of the Orthodox Hasidic sect died Wednesday
morning after being taken to the hospital with internal bleeding,
community leaders said.
</P>
<P>
   His death was not unexpected. He had been ill on and off for the
last six months, said follower Bemyamin Jolkovsky.
</P>
<P>
   Tears flowed from young and old, men and women alike as
thousands packed a two-block area outside the sect's Borough Park
synagogue along 15th Avenue in a final farewell. Crowd estimates by
police and community leaders ranged from a conservative estimate of
10,000 to as many as 20,000.
</P>
<P>
   The mourners included Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Rep. Rick
Lazio, the Republican candidate for U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Bearded men in black and women - their heads covered and wearing
long sleeved shirts and long skirts despite the humid weather -
cried openly after one speaker lost his composure and sobbed
through a prayer.
</P>
<P>
   Loudspeakers were set up outside the synagogue, which seats
4,000, so the overflow crowd could hear the service. Several in the
crowd were overcome by the heat and were tended to by a private
Jewish ambulance service.
</P>
<P>
   Halberstam was known throughout the community as a father figure
and someone who could be counted on for wise advice.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was a sage of this community,'' said Chaim Greenfeld, who
described himself as a cantor and friend of the community. ''He was
looked up to by people who were not his followers.'' Some of the
mourners were said to include members of other Hasidic sects,
including the Satmars.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was a father to everyone,'' said Ann Folger, a Bobov
follower from Flatbush. ''He put together all the families after
the war. He brought them up like his own children. He was a very,
very special man.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bobov sect has its roots in the town of Bobova in what is
now southern Poland and was all but wiped out during the war.
Halberstam, a descendant of one of the first Hasidic leaders in
Europe, survived the purge of Jews by the Nazis, along with his
son, Naftali.
</P>
<P>
   In 1941, the rest of the family perished, including the rebbe's
father, Ben Zion Halberstam, youngest brother and three
brothers-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, he vowed to rebuild the sect. Eventually, in the
early 1960s, he moved with just a handful of followers from Europe
to New York. The group first settled on Manhattan's West Side and
later moved to the Borough Park section.
</P>
<P>
   ''He took the ashes of World War II and turned them into the
seeds of a new community,'' Jolkovsky said. ''He created a fertile
ground for a Jewish community. He was a father to all the orphans
after the war.''
</P>
<P>
   Jolkovsky said the thousands who showed up at the funeral came
out of respect for the man, not because he was a celebrity in the
community. In fact, Jolkovsky said, Halberstam shunned publicity
and was a very private man.
</P>
<P>
   Halberstam, who remarried after the war, is survived by his son
from his first marriage, as well as his sister, his second wife,
another son and five daughters. His eldest son, 71-year-old
Naftali, has been chosen to succeed him as head of the Bobov sect
in Brooklyn. Halberstam was buried at Floral Park Cemetery in South
Brunswick, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   The Bobovs are among about 60 Hasidic sects still in existence.
The largest and most well-known are the Satmars, who originated in
Hungary, and the Lubavitchers, from Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Community officials estimate there are about 10,000 Bobovers in
Brooklyn and thousands more in countries including Israel,
Australia and throughout Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Hasidism is not a denomination but a religious lifestyle and
ideology, which focuses on prayer and the study of Jewish holy
books.

<HEADLINE> Book Distributor Settles Case  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- W.R. Grace &AMP; Co. and a former subsidiary
agreed Wednesday to pay $15.5 million to settle allegations they
overcharged schools, libraries and the government for books over
more than a decade beginning in the early 1980s, the Justice
Department said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   A lawsuit, originally brought by two private whistleblowers and
later taken over by the federal government and 18 states, alleged
that Grace and Baker &AMP; Taylor Inc., a national book distributor
that was a division of Grace until 1993, defrauded the United
States in direct book purchases and indirectly by overcharging
local schools and libraries that bought books with federal grant
money.
</P>
<P>
   Grace agreed to pay the federal government $3 million to resolve
the claims against it, the department said. In addition, Grace and
Baker &AMP; Taylor jointly agreed to pay $12.5 million to the 18 states
who joined the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   This brings the total recovery from the lawsuit to $18.5
million, because last year Baker &AMP; Taylor paid the federal
government $3 million to resolve its direct claims against that
Charlotte, N.C.-based company.
</P>
<P>
   ''This settlement demonstrates the United States' commitment to
protecting federal funds from fraud and abuse,'' said acting
Assistant Attorney General David Ogden, head of the department's
civil division.
</P>
<P>
   In Charlotte, Jim Ulsamer, president of Baker &AMP; Taylor Retail,
said the settlement resolves all claims ''without admitting any
wrongdoing'' by his company. Continuing the litigation would only
have diverted senior managers from new business initiatives,
Ulsamer said.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit under the federal False Claims Act sought damages
and penalties based on Baker &AMP; Taylor's contracts with
institutional customers, in which the company agreed to provide
discounts of about 40 percent on trade books, but then failed to
provide the full discounts by misclassifying trade titles into
non-trade categories. Meanwhile, Baker &AMP; Taylor was providing full
trade discounts on the same books to retailers, the government
said.
</P>
<P>
   Trade books are those intended for a general readership.
</P>
<P>
   Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Florida, Hawaii, Idaho,
Kentucky, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Missouri, Nevada, New Mexico,
North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont and Wisconsin
joined the lawsuit claiming damages on behalf of their schools and
libraries.
</P>
<P>
   The two whistleblowers who brought the original lawsuit, Robert
Costa, head librarian for the city of Richmond, Va., and Ronald
Thornburg, a former Baker &AMP; Taylor sales representative, will share
a portion of the settlement payment.

<HEADLINE> Court agrees to have an outsider monitor death penalty for race bias </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Because no one method can determine whether
minorities are sentenced to die more than whites, the state Supreme
Court ruled Wednesday that a special judge will continue to review
the question of race and the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   The high court made the ruling as it upheld death sentences in
three cases where white victims were murdered.
</P>
<P>
   Included in that trio was the case of Ambrose Harris, who raped
and murdered artist Kristin Huggins in 1992, then drove the woman's
car around Trenton with the body stuffed in the trunk. While on
death row, Harris allegedly stomped fellow inmate Robert ''Mudman''
Simon to death.
</P>
<P>
   Death penalty opponents, including the state Public Defender's
Office, argue that those who kill whites are sentenced to death
more often than those convicted of murdering minorities. Opponents
also contend minority defendants are more likely to face execution
than whites.
</P>
<P>
   Since at least 1992, the Supreme Court has reviewed each death
sentence to determine if the penalty is appropriate. This review
follows any appeal of the trial or conviction. Wednesday's ruling
is the second in the court's two-part examination of its review
process.
</P>
<P>
   By a 6-1 vote, the justices agreed to keep in place presiding
state Appellate Division Judge David S. Baime, who will review that
process and update yearly the statistical analysis of death
sentences.
</P>
<P>
   The judge is needed because the court found no single test or
method that best examines the impact of race.
</P>
<P>
   ''The process is far more complicated than counting the number
of defendants by race and the number of death penalties meted
out,'' Chief Justice Deborah Poritz wrote in the 31-page opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ''A myriad of discretionary decisions are made at every level in
the system, and sorting out their relationship to the race of
either defendants or victims is complex and difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Using a statistical model is ''largely untested and ... its
usefulness is uncertain,'' Poritz wrote. Whatever decision the
court makes, it must be reviewed in the future, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The importance of understanding whether racial discrimination
infects our system of capital punishment requires that we make this
effort,'' Poritz said.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Harris, the court again affirmed death sentences for
Robert W. Morton and Richard Feaster. All three convictions and
sentences were upheld in earlier decisions. Wednesday's rulings
were the second phase of the automatic review for each death
sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Morton stabbed attendant Michael Eck to death during the 1993
robbery of a gas station in Delran. Feaster's death sentence is for
the 1993 murder of a gas station employee in Deptford Township.
</P>
<P>
   These decisions are the final state appeals for each defendant.
Appeals to the federal courts are being considered.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're disappointed because all three had their verdicts upheld
and we think they're glaring examples of this problem,'' said
Deputy Public Defender Claudia Van Wyk. ''When you look at the
whole system, it is the people who kill white people that receive
death sentences.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Wyk said her office is pleased the court will continue to
review the effect of race in death sentences. Public defenders will
also ask for additional judicial review of cases when that special
judge updates his studies.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey joins five other states where the death sentence is
being studied, said Richard Dieter, executive director of the Death
Penalty Information Center.
</P>
<P>
   But to study race, reviewers need to look at all crimes where
the death penalty was a possibility, not just those where verdicts
are reached, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''To New Jersey's credit, they're willing to do that kind of
review,'' Dieter said.
</P>
<P>
   For some death penalty opponents, this study is clearly needed.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's why we're calling for a moratorium in New Jersey,''
said Lois Seeligsohn, a spokeswoman for New Jerseyans for a Death
Penalty Moratorium.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're calling for two years to study the system, which is
broken. Then figure out how we can do it better. I don't think we
can,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> 17 of 18 Westchester beaches to reopen  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW ROCHELLE, N.Y. (AP) - Seventeen of Westchester's 18 closed
beaches will be reopened for swimming on Thursday, the county
Health Department said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The beaches were closed because heavy rains last week swamped
five sewage pumping stations on the shore of Long Island Sound.
</P>
<P>
   Only the Harbor Island Beach in Mamaroneck, which has been shut
down all season, will remain closed, said department spokeswoman
Valerie Goldstein.
</P>
<P>
   Rain water funneling into the sewage system overwhelmed pump
stations in Larchmont, Mamaroneck and New Rochelle. A a result,
some of the sewage entered the sound, diluted and chlorinated but
not otherwise treated, Goldstein said.
</P>
<P>
   These beaches will reopen:
</P>
<P>
   -In New Rochelle, Beckwith Pointe, Davenport Yacht Club, Echo
Bay Yacht Club, Glen Island, Greentree Club, Hudson Park, Marina's
Edge, New Rochelle Rowing Club, Sans Souci, Surf Club and VIP Club.
</P>
<P>
   -In Larchmont, at Larchmont Manor Park and Larchmont Shore Club.
</P>
<P>
   -In Mamaroneck, Beach Point Club, Mamaroneck Beach Yacht and
Cabana Club, Shore Acres Point Club and Orienta Club.

<HEADLINE> Rwanda Accuses Congo in Attacks  </HEADLINE>
By HRVOJE HRANJSKI
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) -- Rwanda's government on Wednesday accused
Congolese President Laurent Kabila's army of attacking Rwandan
forces, saying it was the heaviest fighting since a cease-fire
agreement a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is military activity on all fronts'' said Patrick
Mazimhaka, the presidential foreign policy adviser. The reported
fighting came on the second anniversary of Congo's civil war.
</P>
<P>
   Mazimhaka said the Congo army attacked the Rwandans and allied
Congolese rebels in Kabalo and Kabinda in the diamond-rich southern
Congo. He said it was the most serious fighting since a cease-fire
agreement in August 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Rwanda is one of five nations that have sent troops into the
Congo. Rwanda and Uganda back the rebels who took up arms against
Kabila on Aug. 2, 1998, accusing him of misrule and sheltering
anti-government insurgents.
</P>
<P>
   Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia have sent troops to prop up Kabila,
but have since expressed interest in ending the war.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Kabila and the five nations signed the Lusaka peace
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   But last week, officials from the five warring nations in Congo
criticized Kabila for his refusal to allow the first armed U.N.
peacekeepers into government-controlled Congo and rejecting the
national conference to bring together the government, rebels and
other opposition activists.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fighting becomes more serious when you listen to the
(Congo) government in Kinshasa, which has rejected the peace
agreement, disengagement of forces and deployment of U.N. troops,''
Mazimhaka, the Rwandan official, told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   The Congolese government rejected the accusations.
</P>
<P>
   So far, more than 200 U.N. military observers have deployed in
Congo, instead of a planned force of 5,537 troops and observers
with a mandate to oversee the fragile cease-fire, the withdrawal of
foreign troops and the disarming of Rwandan Hutu militiamen. The
Hutu militiamen are responsible for the 1994 genocide in Rwanda and
have been fighting alongside Congolese government troops.
</P>
<P>
   In the past month, Rwandan and rebel officials and international
aid workers have reported an upsurge in attacks in eastern Congo by
Rwandan Hutu militia, backed by the Congolese army, which left
dozens of Congolese civilians dead and tens of thousands displaced,
most of them fleeing into Uganda.

<HEADLINE> Compassionate about Hillary's campaign? Fuggedaboutit!  </HEADLINE>
By JESSE J. HOLLAND
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) - Can Hillary Rodham Clinton and her Senate
campaign escape criticism among thousands of Republicans attending
their national convention this week? As they say in New York City,
fuggedaboutit!
</P>
<P>
   While party leaders try to keep the negativity low, many
delegates cannot be restrained.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know about you, but I don't want to be lectured for
the next six years by Hillary Rodham Clinton,'' U.S. Rep. Rick
Lazio, her opponent for the Senate seat, told cheering New York
delegates.
</P>
<P>
   During Lazio's abbreviated stay, party staffers passed out
stickers stating: ''Save NY. Stop Hillary.''
</P>
<P>
   New York Gov. George E. Pataki found an innovative way to praise
Laura Bush, wife of Texas Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will finally have a first lady we can be proud of,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to the North Carolina and Delaware delegations, Pataki
identified himself as ''the one who retired Governor Cuomo, and,
yes, I am the governor of the state that is going to retire Hillary
Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican convention officials have said repeatedly they want
the convention to be about the positive Republican message, so no
one has said much about the current first lady during the
convention's nightly sessions.
</P>
<P>
   But once outside, New Yorkers and other state delegates talk
about Clinton among themselves and to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona Sen. John McCain said he is encouraged that she is stuck
at 46 percent in recent polls.
</P>
<P>
   ''If she was running against Howdy Doody, she'd be at 46
percent,'' he said. U.S. Rep. Asa Hutchison, R-Ark., chimed in:
''The only thing I'm afraid of is Hillary will come back to
Arkansas.''
</P>
<P>
   And it's not just the public officials. ''I just think Hillary
Clinton is very aggressive and pushy,'' said Ruthie Johnson, 75, of
Hayden Lake, Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Weber, a conservative activist from Sparks, Nev., said Mrs.
Clinton ''just rubs me the wrong way the minute she opens her
mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   ''She's not very first-ladyesque,'' said Ryan Erwin, executive
director of the Nevada GOP. ''She doesn't have the traditional,
older, dignified glamor. She's not somebody you'd truly like to sit
down with and enjoy some time.''
</P>
<P>
   Trent Clar, chairman of the Idaho Republican Party: ''I've just
always thought that Hillary Clinton came across as a little
arrogant, that she thought her ideas were always right.''
</P>
<P>
   An Albany T-shirt business called Votershop.com even got into
the act, selling anti-Clinton T-shirts at a hotel the New York GOP
made its headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   ''We decided we wanted to do some T-shirts, so people could get
their feelings off their chests and on their sleeves,'' said
37-year-old Mark Jones of Altamont, one of the business founders.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most popular shirts says, ''I LOVE NY (It's Hillary I
can't stand).''
</P>
<P>
   ''That's positive,'' New York GOP Party spokesman Dan Allen
laughed. ''They're in a positive revenue situation.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Interviewed About Waco  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton was interviewed on the phone
Wednesday by a special counsel investigating the siege at the
Branch Davidian compound at Waco, Texas, seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The White House said Clinton spoke about 15 minutes with John
Danforth, a former Republican senator from Missouri whom Attorney
General Janet Reno appointed to conduct an independent
investigation of the Waco disaster.
</P>
<P>
   White House press secretary Joe Lockhart declined to disclose
details of the conversation. Danforth's office refused comment,
citing the ongoing investigation.
</P>
<P>
   In April, Clinton told federal investigators looking into
campaign fund-raising activities that he was wrong to yield to
Justice Department pleas to storm the Branch Davidian compound at
Waco. ''I gave in to the people at the Justice Department who were
pleading to go in early, and I felt personally responsible for what
happened and I still do,'' the president said in an interview with
federal investigators that was released last week. ''I made a
terrible mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Clinton explained that his memory of a visit
to the White House on April 13, 1993, by Indonesian political
supporter James Riady is blurred and incomplete because the events
at Waco were unfolding at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   The siege at Waco began Feb. 28, 1993, when agents of the Bureau
of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms tried to arrest Branch Davidian
leader David Koresh. A gunfight broke out, leaving four ATF agents
and six Davidians dead, and the standoff began.
</P>
<P>
   It ended 51 days later, on April 19, 1993, when tanks driven by
FBI agents pumped tear gas into the compound. A fire broke out and
80 Davidians, including Koresh, died, some from the fire, some from
gunshots.

<HEADLINE> FBI Gets Deadline on E-Mail Inquiry  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE ASSEO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal judge Wednesday gave the FBI 10 days
to respond to a privacy group's request for information about the
government's ''Carnivore'' e-mail surveillance system.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington-based Electronic Privacy Information Center is
seeking documents and software concerning the inner workings of
Carnivore, which is designed to monitor and capture e-mail going to
or from people under criminal investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The privacy group had asked the FBI to grant expedited review of
its request filed under the federal Freedom of Information Act. The
FBI agreed Wednesday to grant such review.
</P>
<P>
   But EPIC lawyer David L. Sobel told U.S. District Judge James
Robertson the FBI's promise to act ''as soon as practicable'' was
too open-ended.
</P>
<P>
   Government lawyer Lisa Barsoomian contended the group's request
for a court order was moot because the FBI had agreed to expedite
its review.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson said, ''I do not consider the Freedom of Information
Act to be a vehicle for getting access to government documents in
real time through litigation.''
</P>
<P>
   However, he directed the FBI to report within 10 days on when it
would begin producing any documents that must be provided under the
freedom of information law.
</P>
<P>
   After the hearing, Sobel called the judge's action ''a very good
result.''
</P>
<P>
   Carnivore devices are installed at a suspect's Internet service
provider to scan the addressing information coming from or going to
a suspect's computer.
</P>
<P>
   Privacy and civil liberties groups have raised concerns about
the tool, and some members of Congress have said they will work on
legislation to rein in Carnivore.
</P>
<P>
   At a congressional hearing last month, FBI officials defended
Carnivore as an investigative tool similar to a telephone wiretap,
saying it is used only with proper legal authorization. FBI
officials objected to making information about Carnivore public on
grounds it could allow people to undermine the system.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- A unidentified woman surprised ''Today'' show
viewers -- and host Katie Couric -- Wednesday morning by opening her
shirt and baring her breasts on the air.
</P>
<P>
   The flasher struck at about 8:30 a.m. as a camera panned a crowd

</P>
<P>
   ''Today'' quickly cut to Couric at the Republican convention in

studio six years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Only East Coast viewers, where the show is broadcast live,
caught the act. Tamer crowd shots were used in other time zones,
Gollust said.

<HEADLINE> 16 more birds confirmed to have West Nile Virus in NYC  </HEADLINE>
By DONNA DE LA CRUZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Sixteen more birds in New York City - 14 of them
on Staten Island - have been diagnosed with the West Nile Virus,
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Ground spraying had already been scheduled for the island
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The two birds most recently found infected in Manhattan were in
Central Park and in Washington Heights at 155th Street, Giuliani
said.
</P>
<P>
   Rockland County - which yielded the first infected fowl of the
season and still has the highest tally in the area - added 10 more
sick birds to its list of 48, the county executive's office said.
Most of the latest batch were in Clarkstown.
</P>
<P>
   In Westchester, a blue jay found dead in Yonkers last month was
the 11th county bird to test positive for the virus, the county
Health Department said.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year the virus has appeared only in birds and
mosquitoes - bloodsucking insects that can spread West Nile to
humans. City Health Commissioner Neal L. Cohen said the city has
ruled out 160 cases of people who had come down with West Nile-like
symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   While some people infected with West Nile show no symptoms,
others suffer from a flu-like condition that can include high
fever, gastrointenstinal problems, muscle ache, headache, or mental
confusion. West Nile can also cause encephalitis, a swelling of the
brain.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, with Queens as the epicenter, the first U.S. case of
West Nile was reported in late August; a total of seven people in
the New York area died and 62 were infected.
</P>
<P>
   The virus is commonly found in Africa, Eastern Europe, West Asia
and the Middle East. Its appearance in the New York area last year
prompted a massive campaign of aerial and ground spraying to kill
mosquitoes.
</P>
<P>
   Central Park, Alley Pond Park in Queens, and the area of
Manhattan and the Bronx north of 110th Street and south of Dyckman
Street, were scheduled to be sprayed with insecticide Friday night.
Central Park and Alley Pond Park have been sprayed before, but
additional mosquitoes were found afterward, Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of birds infected with West Nile have been found on
Staten Island, but Giuliani said no one knows yet why the borough
seems to be the hotbed for the virus.
</P>
<P>
   ''The commissioner (Cohen) the other day came to the conclusion
that a lot of the activity is located there - if you want to call
it the epicenter, that would be a fair conclusion,'' the mayor
said.
</P>
<P>
   To date, a total of 32 West Nile-infected birds have been found
in all five boroughs - 27 in Staten Island, three in Queens and two
in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani again said it would be helpful if New Jersey
communities would conduct precautionary spraying for mosquitos.
</P>
<P>
   ''We talk to them and we make recommendations, but it's their
decision,'' he said. ''It's a medical, scientific, and I guess,
ultimately a political decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in Rockland and Westchester counties, no new spraying
was announced because the areas where the birds were found have
already been sprayed. Spraying was planned for Wednesday night in
Ardsley and parts of Ossining and White Plains.
</P>
<P>
   In Rockland County, spraying was scheduled for Wednesday night
in New Square and parts of Spring Valley, Kaser and New Hemstead.

<HEADLINE> NY faces crisis of soaring electricity prices  </HEADLINE>
By VERENA DOBNIK
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - The price of powering New York City is
skyrocketing, creating an electricity crisis that's turning up the
heat most on the city's poorest residents, state legislators said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the coolest July since 1914, average rates for Con
Edison's 3.3 million residential customers were 43 percent higher
during the month than last July.
</P>
<P>
   ''The energy policies of this state have failed, and failed
miserably,'' said Paul Tonko, chairman of the State Assembly Energy
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   He joined six other members of the Assembly at a hearing that
discussed the question of whether electricity bills would continue
to climb.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know,'' was Con Ed chairman Eugene McGrath's reply.
</P>
<P>
   Tonko said New Yorkers who suffer most are older people on fixed
incomes and low-income families.
</P>
<P>
   Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver laid the blame on last August's
deregulation plan. Con Ed no longer produces its own power; it
transmits electricity bought from independently owned generating
companies.
</P>
<P>
   That, Silver said, allows ''one of the nation's biggest
utilities to pass higher wholesale prices on to consumers,''
instead of creating healthy competition that keeps prices in check.
</P>
<P>
   Maureen Helmer, head of the state Public Service Commission that
regulates utilities, told the hearing that in the long run, the
state plan will create competition, which with more plants in the
works to meet demand, will result in ''a competitive marketplace
for electricity that would benefit consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Commercial customers, including hospitals and manufacturers,
face an even higher average increase - 49 percent for July over
that month last year.
</P>
<P>
   Supermarket owner Alfredo Rodriguez, who appeared at the
hearing, called his own electricity bills ''a nail in the coffin''
- for the month, 130 percent over July 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The 39-year-old businessman with a wife and three children owns
an Associated market in East Harlem. He laid out the bills on an
oak table outside the New York Bar Association hearing room where
the panel was grilling the utility executive: a Con Ed bill of
$5,477 for July 1999, versus $12,139 for July 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm debating whether to pay the bill,'' said Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   McGrath told the legislators that this year's higher costs
reflect the prices his utility is paying to buy electricity at
unpredictable market rates. The generating companies, in turn, are
absorbing the rising prices of the oil that fuels many plants, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not the supplier. We're like FedEx, delivering a product
from a catalog,'' said McGrath, noting that FedEx, like his
utility, would not be held responsible for the price of an item.
</P>
<P>
   Tonko, the energy committee chairman, countered that states
surrounding New York achieve lower prices through energy policies
that are ''more aggressively consumer-oriented.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Con Ed is enjoying ''risk-free capitalism,'' with demand
in a booming economy outstripping energy supply and inflating
prices further.
</P>
<P>
   The typical Con Ed residential bill for July 1999 was about $51,
while the average bill hit $73 last month, reflecting an increase
from 17.3 to 24.5 cents per kilowatt hour. The cost per kilowatt
hour for large businesses jumped from 16.4 to 24.5 cents.
</P>
<P>
   McGrath promised that his utility would work with state
regulators and suppliers to try to knock down costs. Meanwhile, he
suggested, unhappy customers can do business with other unregulated
suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   But Rodriguez insisted that ''if you switch, you get two bills -
and one is from Con Ed, for the line, which is a monopoly. They're
the only game in town.''

<HEADLINE> Former security guard says he was defending himself in fatal assault </HEADLINE>
By JOHN CURRAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) - A former Trump Plaza Hotel &AMP; Casino
guard accused in the fatal beating of an unruly gambler took the
stand in his own defense Wednesday, saying he resorted to force to
protect himself and other guards from the victim.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Petty, 35, said he shoved Hue To into a chair in the
casino's security office because To, who had been ejected from the
casino for harassing and panhandling other gamblers, had threatened
to kill Petty and three other guards and was swinging wildly.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was threatening to kill me,'' said Petty, under questioning
from Chief Assistant Atlantic County Prosecutor Ellen Loughney.
''Mr. To had his hands in my face and I pushed him.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was scared. I wanted to keep this man away from myself and
others,'' Petty said.
</P>
<P>
   To, 25, of Plainfield, died of a spinal injury after Petty
allegedly threw him into a door and kicked him. Petty is charged
with aggravated manslaughter and four counts of witness tampering
in the Sept. 8, 1998, incident.
</P>
<P>
   The tampering charge stems from Petty's alleged attempts to
bully the other security guards who were present into lying for him
in their official reports on the incident.
</P>
<P>
   In testimony Tuesday, Petty blamed fellow guard James Marsico
for roughing up To.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know what Marsico did, but he spun him around and
pounded his face against the wall,'' Petty testified. Loughney then
accused Petty of blaming Marsico because Marsico was the first
guard to come forward to say the incident didn't happen the way the
guards first said it did.
</P>
<P>
   Marsico's credibility was impeached Wednesday when the defense
presented a witness who said Marsico admitted to him that he hadn't
seen the fatal altercation.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Doran, an Atlantic City police detective who is a close
friend of Marsico's, said Marsico called to ask his advice on
whether Marsico could get in trouble if his official statement was
found to be inaccurate.
</P>
<P>
   In the statement, he said Petty was the one who threw To into a
door and kicked him ''like a football.''
</P>
<P>
   But he admitted to his friend that he didn't see what happened.
</P>
<P>
   ''He said he was in an adjoining room and that he heard noises
but that he didn't observe anything,'' Doran said.
</P>
<P>
   Closing arguments are expected to begin Thursday. If convicted,
Petty faces 10 to 30 years in prison.

<HEADLINE> Nassau medical center employee charges hospital chairman with sex harassment </HEADLINE>
By PAT MILTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINEOLA, N.Y. (AP) - A secretary at the Nassau County Medical
Center has charged the hospital board chairman with threatening to
dismiss her if she did not engage in sex acts with him, the woman's
attorney said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Sally Pistorio McGrath, a 36-year-old mother of three, claims
she was subjected to numerous requests for sex by Eric Rosenblum,
the hospital chairman, since shortly after she began working for
Rosenblum as his administrative assistant in December.
</P>
<P>
   McGrath charges in a notice of claim, a preliminary step to a
lawsuit, served on Nassau County Tuesday that Rosenblum asked her
to engage in group sex, sent letters and e-mails seeking sex and on
one occasion grabbed her hand and forced it on his crotch.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was lewd and disgusting,'' said McGrath's attorney, Alan
Sanders. ''We are not talking about ''did he or didn't he cross
over the line here,'' he said. ''This man clearly sexually
assaulted this woman.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosenblum, an attorney, of Levittown, was appointed board
chairman by Nassau County Executive Thomas Gulotta. He called the
allegations lies and said he does not intend to resign his
position. The job is unsalaried.
</P>
<P>
   Nassau County spokeswoman Diane Baumert-Moyik, said the county
attorney is reviewing the notice of claim which names Rosenblum and
Nassau County as respondents. The Nassau County Medical Center
board - which includes state and county appointees - is conducting
an internal investigation into the complaint, Baumert-Moyik said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will await any recommendations by the board,'' she said.
''Ultimately it is up to the county legislature to act on the
recommendations if there are any.''
</P>
<P>
   McGrath also has filed a complaint with the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission, a preliminary step to filing a federal
lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   McGrath, of Jericho, said she did not come forward sooner
because she feared losing her $30,000-a-year job. She and her
husband, John, a construction worker, have six children.
</P>
<P>
   ''She was intimidated by this man,'' Sanders said, adding that
Rosenblum, a Republican party leader, told McGrath it would do her
no good to report him.
</P>
<P>
   ''He told her point blank (he has) every judge in Nassau County
in his pocket,'' said Sanders. At her request, McGrath has been
transferred to another department at the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders said he has copies of letters Rosenblum allegedly sent
McGrath and a disc filled with e-mails as evidence. In addition, he
said other female employees have contacted him with similar
complaints.
</P>
<P>
   ''My client wants me to send a message to all employers who
think they are above the law that they will be held accountable for
their actions,'' Sanders said.

<HEADLINE> Court says grandparents can't be forced to support grandchildren  </HEADLINE>
By NANCY PARELLO
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Grandparents can't be forced to provide
financial support for their grandchildren, even if they're born to
minor children, an appeals court ruled this week.
</P>
<P>
   The mother of a teen mom sued the teen dad's father to help
support the South Jersey girl's 21-month-old daughter.
</P>
<P>
   The girl was 14 when she became pregnant and the boy was 15.
Their daughter was born in November 1998. Court documents don't
identify the teens or their parents.
</P>
<P>
   The teen girl lives with her mother, who helps support the baby.
</P>
<P>
   The court rejected the argument that grandparents should be held
responsible because the teens don't have the resources to care for
the child themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The court noted that the state Legislature has passed laws to
hold a parent responsible for certain costs related to their
children's behavior, such as school vandalism, but has never said
they should be responsible for the offspring of their minor
children.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no statutory or judicial requirement that the parents
of minor girls who have children out of wedlock must support their
grandchildren. Nor is there a statutory or judicial requirement
that the parents of minor boys who father children out of wedlock
must support their grandchild,'' the ruling said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Such an obligation could dramatically change the financial and
other relationship within a family, and in our view such a policy
change should come from the Legislature.''
</P>
<P>
   Kimberly Sutton, an attorney who represented the girl's mother,
said she ''was disappointed in the decision.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The ruling leaves these infants with absolutely no legal
rights of support because their parents are minors under the law,''
Sutton said. ''They have no means of support.''
</P>
<P>
   Sutton had argued that it is a parent's obligation to support
their minor child's offspring.
</P>
<P>
   But the court also said the child support order of $20 a week -
the boy's weekly allowance - should be recalculated. It should
consider what the boy, identified in court papers only as S.M. Jr.,
would earn if he could work full time.
</P>
<P>
   The boy's father prohibited his son from working full time to
help support S.M. Jr.'s daughter. He said that would interfere with
the boy's schoolwork. S.M. Jr. had been having trouble in school
and was starting to do better, according to court documents.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court ordered the boy's father to make up the
difference between the $20 a week allowance and the boy's earning
potential.
</P>
<P>
   ''...having limited S.M. Jr.'s ability to earn income, S.M. Sr.
must be responsible for the consequences of his own decision,'' the
ruling said.
</P>
<P>
   Carolyn Uliase, the attorney for the defendants, said her
clients asked her not to comment on the case.

<HEADLINE> US: Goals Unfilled on Iraq  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The 10th anniversary of Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait passed with the Clinton administration admitting that many
U.S. goals remain unfulfilled, including the ouster of President
Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the State Department said Wednesday, Iraq is far
weaker militarily than it was.
</P>
<P>
   ''A decade has now lapsed with Saddam unable to invade a
neighbor. That fact alone marks an important success for the
international community,'' said David Welch, who heads the State
Department's international organizations bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Welch conceded that the February 1991 liberation of Kuwait by a
U.S.-led coalition was not the final chapter of the Iraq saga.
</P>
<P>
   Saddam has not given up his weapons of mass destruction and
continues abusive practices, Welch said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not over for some 600 Kuwaiti missing persons and POWs
seized by Iraqi forces in Kuwait,'' he said. ''Nor is it over for
the people of Iraq who continue to suffer the brutal misrule of the
Saddam Hussein regime.''
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said Wednesday the United
States spends well over $1 billion a year patrolling Iraq with jet
fighters to keep Iraqi warplanes grounded. Also, to deter future
Iraqi adventurism, the United States maintains 24,000 troops on
station in the Persian Gulf region.
</P>
<P>
   David Scheffer, U.S. ambassador-at-large for war crimes who
joined Welch at a news conference, renewed the administration's
wish that a war crimes tribunal be established for Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Scheffer said the administration is collecting evidence to hold
Saddam and top aides accountable for two decades of crimes against
Iraqis and the people of the countries Iraqi forces have invaded,
Kuwait and Iran.
</P>
<P>
   ''He must be brought to account for his crimes,'' Scheffer said.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has had little to say about Saddam's efforts
to reconstitute weapons of mass destruction since Iraq expelled
U.N. weapons inspectors in December 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Butler, former chairman of the defunct U.S. weapons
inspection agency, says Saddam has not been sitting on his hands.
</P>
<P>
   Saddam, Butler wrote in The Washington Post, is ''manufacturing
the weapons of mass destruction with which he threatens the Iraqi
people, his neighbors and, by extension, the safety of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations is to try and send new inspectors soon. But
because Iraq remains under sanctions for ignoring terms of the
cease-fire, Saddam is not expected to cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   That the Iraq agenda remains unfinished after 10 years is duly
noted in the Republican presidential campaign platform.
</P>
<P>
   ''Perhaps nowhere has the inheritance of Republican governance
been squandered so fatefully as with respect to Iraq,'' the GOP
platform plank on Iraq says. ''The anti-Iraq coalition assembled to
oppose Saddam Hussein has disintegrated.'' It adds that the
administration has only ''pretended'' to support the removal of
Saddam Hussein from power.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics argue that the problems could have been avoided if
former President Bush had not called off the Desert Storm operation
without removing Saddam by force if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has appropriated $97 million for use by anti-Saddam
Iraqis to oust his regime. Some opposition leaders have complained
bitterly that no money has been earmarked for lethal equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Welch suggested that the administration must proceed cautiously
lest rebel forces receiving U.S. support face annihilation by
Saddam's troops.
</P>
<P>
   ''We would like to help them in a way that's responsible ... and
doesn't raise undue risk to them, either inside or outside,'' he
said.

<HEADLINE> ''Crustaceans in Paradise'' wins 25th annual crab beauty pageant  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN CURRAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   OCEAN CITY, N.J. (AP) - ''Crustaceans in Paradise,'' two
elaborately dressed Jimmy Buffett-loving hermit crabs lounging on a
tiny beach beneath pipe-cleaner palm trees, captured top honors
Wednesday in the 25th annual Miss Crustacean beauty pageant for
crabs.
</P>
<P>
   The entry, submitted by 10 young cousins, bested 30 other
similarly outlandish creations to win the pageant, held annually in
this southern New Jersey resort as a parody of the Miss America
Pageant.
</P>
<P>
   The winning crabs were presented on an old children's billiards
table that was converted into a miniature island paradise, replete
with sandy beach, a thatched hut made of wooden sticks, an
''ocean'' made of stapled blue garlands and tiny umbrellas.
</P>
<P>
   The two crabs wore flowered shirts and miniature pith helmets as
they scurried around on the sand. The 2-by-3-foot entry was carried
by the cousins, who were decked out in hula dresses, flowered
shirts and multi-colored ''Parrothead'' hats inspired by Buffett.
</P>
<P>
   The creators were Meghann Dougherty, 13, Kevin Dougherty, 11, of
Flourtown, Pa., and their cousins Ryan Moore, 12, and Jeffrey
Moore, 14, of Columbia, Pa., and Alessandra Cerchione, 10, Gregory
Cerchione, 8, and Francesca Cercione, 13, of Brooklyn, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   After the winner was announced, one of the crabs took the
traditional victory walk, making its way down a miniature runway
before the handlers were presented with the Cucumber Rind Cup,
''the symbol of crustacean comeliness'' given to each year's
winner.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other entries: Crab Salad, giant salad bowl with a
hermit crab inside; Vote Republican - George Crab Bush, which had a
red, white and blue GOP convention theme; and New Jersey Deviled
Crab, which was a cardboard box decorated to look like a hockey
arena and carried by four small children wearing devil's horns and
New Jersey Devils hockey jerseys.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is really, really big,'' said the city's municipal
publicist, Mark Soifer, who dreamed up the event in 1975 as a
publicity stunt and has watched it achieve worldwide notoriety.
</P>
<P>
   It was once a question on ''Jeopardy'' and has received coverage
from U.S. News &AMP; World Report, the Wall Street Journal and CNN in
years past.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, though, there was only one television camera on
the beach to cover the event.
</P>
<P>
   ''If it weren't for the Republican National Convention, there'd
be more media here today. But we won't quibble about it,'' said
Soifer.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Up 81; Nasdaq Ends Down 27  </HEADLINE>
By DUNSTAN PRIAL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Blue chip stocks moved higher Wednesday,
rallying in the wake of more encouraging news that left investors
optimistic that the economy is indeed slowing down.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 80.58 at 10,687.53.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 0.60 at 1,438.70 but the
Nasdaq composite index gave back some earlier gains and closed down
27.06 at 3,658.46.
</P>
<P>
   Interest rate sensitive Dow stocks surged after the Conference
Board reported that its leading economic indicators were unchanged
in June.
</P>
<P>
   An important gauge of future economic activity, the Index of
Leading Economic Indicators held steady at 106 in June. If the
forecast is accurate, the numbers would mean a break from rapid
economic growth for the rest of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the government reported that U.S. home sales
declined in June to their lowest level in two and a half years.
</P>
<P>
   Investors viewed both economic reports as signs that the Federal
Reserve Board's strategy of raising interest rates during the past
year has been successful.
</P>
<P>
   ''The rally came right after the numbers were released and the
feeling is that there's a relatively good chance that the Fed's not
going to do anything'' at its next meeting Aug. 22, said Tom
Gallagher, head of U.S. equity markets for CIBC World Markets in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, three other reports also indicated that the economy
is easing after a decade of explosive growth.
</P>
<P>
   Banking stocks advanced Wednesday on the belief that lending and
underwriting activity of stocks and bonds will stay healthy if
interest rates remain stable based on the positive economic
indicators. Lehman Brothers rose $5.75 to $118.50, and Merrill
Lynch rose $1.75 to $127.
</P>
<P>
   Gallagher noted that Wednesday's rally was confined to a limited
number of stocks, which he attributed to caution on the part of
investors who remain hopeful -- but not certain -- that the Fed will
leave interest rates alone.
</P>
<P>
   On the Nasdaq, a handful of widely held stocks, including Cisco
Systems and Dell Computer, fell on fears that revenues may decline
in the second half of 2000. Cisco fell $2.25 to $60.938, and Dell
lost $2 to $39.563.
</P>
<P>
   Those long-range fears helped drag down the broader technology
sector.
</P>
<P>
   Some lesser known technology stocks surged after reporting
better-than-expected second-quarter earnings. For example,
technology consulting company Sapient Corp. rose $16.938 to
$120.813 after reporting second-quarter earnings of 23 cents a
share, excluding one-time expenditures. The figure beat analyst
expectations by 3 cents. In addition, the company announced a
two-for-one stock split.
</P>
<P>
   And Protein Design Labs rose $15.141 to $147.75 after reporting
earnings of 23 cents a share, beating analysts' predictions of 18
cents.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues were ahead of decliners by a 5 to 4 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 1.18 billion
shares, ahead of Tuesday's pace of 1.11 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was up 2.45 at 500.22.

<HEADLINE> Atlantic City tries again to bask in spotlight of GOP convention  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) - Gamely trying to attract attention of
their own, Atlantic City tourism leaders set up ''the world's
largest craps table'' Wednesday in hopes of luring media who are in
the region to cover the Republican National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   For a second day, though, they failed.
</P>
<P>
   The 8-by-21-foot table, which was equipped with 1-foot square
foam dice and a seven-foot rake, was set up on the Boardwalk near
Park Place. Passers-by were invited to take their chance at winning
T-shirts, postcards and other prizes provided by casinos, but no
money was wagered.
</P>
<P>
   No convention-covering media types came, either. The same was
true Tuesday, when the Atlantic City Convention and Visitors
Authority sponsored a nine-hole golf tournament on a makeshift
course on the beach in hopes of luring people from the Philadelphia
convention.
</P>
<P>
   ''We wanted to create some excitement about Atlantic City, do a
little fun, showbiz-kind of thing and capture people's attention,''
said Speros Batistatos, president of the authority.
</P>
<P>
   He said he wasn't bothered by the fact that only local media and
Boardwalk tourists showed up.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not discouraged,'' said Batistatos.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Agents Dismantle Drug Ring  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal agents are examining records seized at
dozens of sites as they dismantled what they called a nationwide
ring supplying pseudoephedrine to clandestine labs that turned it
into methamphetamine.
</P>
<P>
   Over the course of the investigation, which began in December,
Operation Mountain Express has led to more than 160 arrests -- 60 of
them since the investigation allegedly was disclosed last week to
one of the targets by a federal grand juror in Denver. Agents
searched 66 locations since Friday and used civil and
administrative enforcement actions to close down pseudoephedrine
operations at 18 companies.
</P>
<P>
   This distribution ring was headed by a group of 10 people, who
called themselves ''the Commission'' and shipped their profits to
the Middle East, Drug Enforcement Administration officials said
Tuesday. Agents said the seized records would help them understand
the methods and scope of the operation and could lead to further
arrests.
</P>
<P>
   Agents arrested eight of the 10 alleged commission members,
including Hassan Zaghmot of Denver. They found $650,000 in cash in
Zaghmot's safe deposit box, which he intended to use to finance a
quick escape, according to DEA officials, who requested anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   They said one of the 10 kingpins was out of the country and the
other may have fled after the latest round of arrests began Friday
with Zaghmot's arrest after a federal grand juror allegedly tipped
him off about the sealed indictment against him.
</P>
<P>
   The federal grand juror, Mark J. Hinckley, 37, of Evergreen,
Colo., was arrested Monday night in Denver night on charges that he
told Zaghmot on July 27 that the grand jury had returned a sealed
indictment against him. Federal agents watching Zaghmot on a
court-approved concealed camera saw and heard Hinckley ask for
$50,000 for details of the indictment, the government said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was the first time that U.S. law enforcement has been
able to connect a major group of pseudoephedrine distributors
directly to U.S.-based, Mexican-controlled methamphetamine
laboratory operators,'' said Joe Keefe, chief of DEA's special
operations division.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these traffickers were charged with intent to
manufacturer methamphetamine; previously pseudoephedrine
traffickers had largely faced only civil penalties for diversion of
regulated substances, Keefe said.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno told a news conference, ''This
operation should send a message to anyone involved in
methamphetamine production and distribution that we are continuing
the fight in every way we know how so that this problem won't be
treating communities of America as crack did in the 1980s.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno and DEA Administrator Donnie Marshall announced the
operation had seized $8 million in cash, 10 metric tons of
pseudoephedrine, capable of producing 18,000 pounds of
methamphetamine, 83 pounds of finished methamphetamine, two
pseudoephedrine extraction laboratories, one methamphetamine
laboratory and 136 pounds of processing chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   DEA officials said the commission set prices, determined the
methods of transportation, sent profits to Israel, Jordan, Syria
and Saudi Arabia and set up front companies to buy and ship
pseudoephedrine tablets to methamphetamine laboratories in southern
California.
</P>
<P>
   Pseudoephedrine tablets are imported for legal use in
over-the-counter cold and allergy remedies.
</P>
<P>
   DEA officials it costs $450 to make a pound of tablets for
legitimate use, but the traffickers would buy the tablets from
legitimate importers for $1,500 a pound, then ship them through a
series of front companies to the West Coast and sell them to
clandestine methamphetamine labs for $4,000 a pound. One pound of
tablets produces roughly a pound of methamphetamine, which is sold
for $14,000 to $15,000 a pound in the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, DEA agents served an administrative order at
Advance Pharmaceuticals in Ronkonkoma, N.Y., revoking its license
to engage in pseudoephedrine business. Advance's attorney Jeffrey
Badner said Wednesday that the company has disputed in a civil case
the DEA's allegations that it engaged in suspicious pseudoephedrine
transactions. Advance's other, larger pharmaceutical businesses
were not affected by the DEA action, Badner said.

<HEADLINE> Financial adviser to the stars pleads guilty  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - A financial adviser to young celebrities pleaded
guilty to fraud charges Wednesday, tearfully admitting that he
ripped off some of his clients after the business he built ''became
so big, so overwhelming, that I lost control.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a terrible day in my life,'' 37-year-old Dana
Giacchetto said as he began sobbing while admitting his crime in a
plea deal with U.S. prosecutors in federal court in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The deal called for Giacchetto to be sentenced Nov. 3 to a
prison term ranging between three years and 10 months and four
years and nine months for losing between $5 million and $10 million
of his clients' money.
</P>
<P>
   The blonde-haired college graduate in the last decade had built
his investment business, The Cassandra Group, into a large enough
name that he found himself a regular on the Hollywood party
circuit.
</P>
<P>
   The boyish looking Giacchetto mingled with young celebrities
including Matt Damon, Cameron Diaz and singer Alanis Morrisette.
All became clients, as did Leonardo DiCaprio, Ben Stiller and
Courtney Cox Arquette.
</P>
<P>
   Giacchetto made no mention of specific clients as he pleaded
guilty to fraud under the federal Investment Advisers Act, but he
did say he would ''pray and hope we will make reparations and no
one will lose money.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd like to apologize to everyone that I've caused harm to,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sniffling and wiping his eyes with a tissue, Giacchetto told
U.S. District Judge Robert P. Patterson that he started his
business because he dreamt of creating an investment bank to
empower the artist community.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was an artist as a child and thought artists were
routinely exploited.
</P>
<P>
   He said he thought he had reached his goal when ''what I built
became so big, so overwhelming, that I lost control.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge asked him if he knew he was violating the law.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yes I did,'' he said. ''I did it knowingly and willfully. I
always intended that everyone would be paid back and taken care
of.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge also asked if he made false statements and sent false
information to clients to cover up the crimes as they occurred from
1997 through March 31.
</P>
<P>
   ''On some occasions, yes,'' he answered.
</P>
<P>
   He said he misappropriated his clients' money when he had some
of their money placed in the account of his business where he could
spend it how he wished.
</P>
<P>
   Giacchetto already has served four months in prison.
</P>
<P>
   His $1 million bail was withdrawn earlier this year after
prosecutors said he was caught at Newark International Airport in
New Jersey with an expired passport, a bag of cash and $44,000 in
airline tickets.

<HEADLINE> Investor must pay legal fees of husband who allegedly tried to kill her </HEADLINE>
By SAMUEL MAULL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - An investment executive has been ordered to give
her husband money for legal fees despite his being charged with
attempted murder for allegedly bashing her in the head with a
10-pound barbell.
</P>
<P>
   Justice David Saxe of the State Supreme Court's Appellate
Division ordered Theresa Havell, 53, to give $215,000 to lawyers
for her husband, Aftab Islam, 59.
</P>
<P>
   New York law says that with few exceptions, fault is not a
factor in dividing marital assets.
</P>
<P>
   Saxe's July 26 order modified a lower court ruling.
</P>
<P>
   On July 24, State Supreme Court Justice Jacqueline Silbermann
ordered Havell to give Islam $450,000 from his share of their
marital assets. The judge's decision did not explain why Havell -
who founded and runs Havell Capital Management - has control of all
the money.
</P>
<P>
   Havell objected to the disbursement, saying Islam's alleged
attempt to kill her should bar him from sharing their money. But
Silbermann found ''the husband would not be deprived of any
interest in the marital property under the existing case law, and
that the amount requested was essentially (minimal) in light of the
size of the marital estate.'' The judge said the amount was about
4.5 percent of the couples' total assets.
</P>
<P>
   Saxe told lawyers for the estranged couple to submit papers to
the Appellate Division and a full panel of the court will decide
whether Islam should get the rest of the $450,000 he asked for.
</P>
<P>
   Havell's lawyer, Ellen Gesmer, refused to comment on the case.
</P>
<P>
   Islam, free on $1 million bail, is charged with trying to kill
his wife in their East 78th Street home early on April 22, 1999. He
pleaded not guilty and a psychiatric defense.
</P>
<P>
   Havell underwent surgery at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical
Center for skull fractures and other broken bones. Several of her
teeth were knocked out and she needed 100 stitches on her face and
head.
</P>
<P>
   Court papers said Islam, married to Havell for 21 years, told
police he hit his wife after she bit him when he gently stroked her
hair. He blamed the incident on a combination of wine and
prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Islam is charged with attempted murder, criminal possession of a
dangerous weapon, and three counts of endangering the welfare of a
child. He allegedly attacked his wife in front of three of their
six children, ages 15, 12 and 9.
</P>
<P>
   His trial is scheduled to start Aug. 21. He faces up to 25 years
in prison if he is convicted.

<HEADLINE> State issues severe warnings to 14 nursing homes  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BINGHAMTON, N.Y. (AP) - New York state health officials cited 14
nursing homes for serious lapses in care that may have led to the
deaths of several patients.
</P>
<P>
   State officials said the reports offer a measure of proof that
New York's Health Department has taken steps to improve its system
for policing nursing homes.
</P>
<P>
   Among the reports' findings were:
</P>
<P>
   Two residents of the Loretto Geriatric Center in Syracuse
suffocated within a week of one another, both times because the
home failed to address long-standing problems with their care.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the state has refused to Loretto of Utica to accept
new patients after it received an ''immediate jeopardy citation''
for more widespread problems.
</P>
<P>
   The Chemung County Nursing Facility ran into trouble after a man
pried the screen off his fourth-floor bedroom window one night in
May and leaped out, causing injuries that ultimately killed him.
</P>
<P>
   The staff at the home had seen him trying to escape from the
building before and knew he had threatened suicide two weeks
before, but did not do enough to monitor his condition, inspectors
said.
</P>
<P>
   Similar problems have been found at a list of other homes from
the countryside south of Rochester to New York City and its
northern suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Health Department had only 198 people to oversee
2,406 nursing homes, home health care agencies and adult homes.
</P>
<P>
   Department analysts concluded in an internal June 1999 report
that those levels had caused problems ''both of quantity and
quality'' in the state's nursing home enforcement system.
</P>
<P>
   That system was criticized by the U.S. Health Care Financing
Administration, the federal agency that controls the government's
Medicare insurance program, for overlooking serious - and in some
cases life-threatening - problems.
</P>
<P>
   In almost every case in which the federal government spot checks
the state's work, it finds problems that the state should have made
note of but didn't.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very clear that they've upped the ante,'' said Nancy
Tucker, the director of nursing facility policy at the New York
Association of Homes and Services for the Aging, an Albany group
that represents hundreds of the state's nonprofit homes. ''The
department is responding to a lot of criticism, which has put a lot
of facilities between a rock and a hard place.''
</P>
<P>
   The nursing homes cited are:
</P>
<P>
   -Kirkhaven Nursing Home, Rochester
</P>
<P>
   -Bethany Nursing Home, Rochester
</P>
<P>
   -Chemung County Nursing Facility, Elmira
</P>
<P>
   -Loretto of Syracuse
</P>
<P>
   -Loretto of Utica
</P>
<P>
   -John E. Andrus Memorial Home, Westchester County
</P>
<P>
   -Hornell Gardens Nursing and Rehabilitation Center
</P>
<P>
   -Northeast Center for Special Care, Lake Katrine
</P>
<P>
   -Victory Lake Nursing Home, New Rochelle
</P>
<P>
   -Throggs Neck Nursing Home, Bronx
</P>
<P>
   -University Nursing Home, Bronx
</P>
<P>
   -Daughters of Jacob Nursing Home, Bronx
</P>
<P>
   -Rutland Nursing Home, Brooklyn
</P>
<P>
   -Brooklyn United Methodist Church Home

<HEADLINE> Puerto Rico Releases FBI Files  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS HAWLEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- Puerto Rico released long-secret
FBI files on the U.S. territory's first elected governor Wednesday,
giving a glimpse of Washington's uneasiness as it granted the
island more autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   The documents on Luis Munoz Marin were among more than 12,000
FBI files on Puerto Ricans, including independence activists, given
to the island's Senate this week. More will be released this month.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI denied investigating Puerto Rican independence activists
until this year, when director Louis Freeh confirmed the files
existed and released them to Congress at the request of Puerto
Rico-born Rep. Jose Serrano, a New York Democrat. Serrano's office
began transferring the files to Puerto Rico last week.
</P>
<P>
   The documents provide an intimate look at U.S. dealings with the
territory it wrested from Spain in the 1898 Spanish-American War.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a gold mine for historians,'' said local Sen. Kenneth
McClintock. ''This could answer a lot of questions and reveal a lot
of mysteries about our past.''
</P>
<P>
   Those released Wednesday focus on Munoz, a one-time independence
supporter revered here for his role in developing Puerto Rico's
economy and fashioning its semi-autonomous status as a U.S.
commonwealth in 1952.
</P>
<P>
   Munoz was elected governor in 1948 and served until 1965. He
died in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   An informant erroneously warned in 1940 that Munoz, then a
rising star in the island's Senate, was ''the ranking official of
the Communist Party in the West Indies and the Caribbean Sea
area.''
</P>
<P>
   The warning touched off an investigation because Munoz was about
to visit the White House at the invitation of first lady Eleanor
Roosevelt. The FBI apparently concluded Munoz posed no threat, but
it watched him closely for the next three decades.
</P>
<P>
   Special reports examined his friendship with Rexford G. Tugwell,
Puerto Rico's last U.S. administrator and a supporter of
self-government.
</P>
<P>
   Later entries record dozens of alleged plots against Munoz by
independence groups.
</P>
<P>
   Puerto Rico itself maintained files on 130,000 suspected
independence activists from the 1940s until 1987, when the local
Supreme Court banned the practice. Thousands of citizens have since
sued the government.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Lauds Colo. on Gun Shows  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton on Wednesday commended a
state ballot initiative to close what critics complain is a gun
show loophole in Colorado -- and then scolded Congress for failing
to pass gun safety legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ''Colorado voters can now do what Congress has failed to do:
close a deadly loophole that allows criminals, juveniles and other
restricted persons to buy guns at gun shows with no questions
asked,'' Clinton said. ''Congress should heed the voices of
millions of Americans concerned about gun violence -- not those of
the gun lobby -- and follow the lead of states like Colorado.''
</P>
<P>
   A group called SAFE Colorado, which was formed after the
Columbine High School shootings, has submitted nearly double the
required number of voter signatures to place the measure on the
November ballot. The group, which needed 62,438 valid signatures of
registered voters to gain a spot on the ballot, submitted about
110,000 signatures on Wednesday to the secretary of state's office
in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   The group wants to close a perceived shortcoming in state law
that members said helped the Columbine shooters obtain three of the
four firearms they used to kill 13 people and then themselves on
April 20, 1999. Daniel Mauser, son of SAFE's director of political
affairs, Tom Mauser, died in the shootings.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative, which has survived several legal challenges,
would require state-run criminal background checks of people trying
to buy firearms from any seller at gun shows. Under existing law,
only people trying to buy firearms from federally licensed dealers
must submit to a background check.

	   ALLAMUCHY TOWNSHIP, N.J. (AP) - A New Jersey State Police
trooper admitted Wednesday to assaulting a prisoner arrested on a
drug charge.
</P>
<P>
   Trooper Timothy M. Smith, 35, of Hackettstown, pleaded guilty to
one count of simple assault in Municipal Court. Smith admitted to
assaulting Justin Mills, a Nebraska man who had been arrested Dec.
27 and charged with possession of a controlled dangerous substance,
State Police spokesman John Hagerty said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith assaulted Mills at a State Police holding facility,
Hagerty said. He wouldn't say where the facility was or elaborate
on the nature of the assault charge, saying State Police have to
complete an internal investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Because of his plea, Smith cannot hold a job as a police officer
in the state, Hagerty said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith is a 12-year veteran and was assigned to the Troop B
patrol in northern New Jersey.

<HEADLINE> Unions say strike possible in Verizon talks  </HEADLINE>
By GREG TOPPO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) - Officials of unions representing more than
85,000 Verizon Communications workers in 12 eastern states say
contract negotiations remain so far apart a strike is possible this
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Verizon workers from Maine to Virginia are negotiating for
higher pay, better benefits and improved working conditions. Union
negotiators also are trying to organize wireless workers at
Verizon, formerly known as Bell Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   One union source, discussing the situation on condition of
anonymity, said a strike was ''very possible,'' but talks are
continuing.
</P>
<P>
   Responding, Verizon spokesman Steve Marcus said: ''Both sides
are continuing to negotiate in good faith and are working hard to
reach an agreement by the deadline of the current contracts. We are
hopeful that this can be accomplished.''
</P>
<P>
   Verizon was created in June by the merger of Bell Atlantic and
GTE Corp. Its wireless operation is its fastest growing division, a
separate company run through a joint venture with Vodafone
AirTouch.
</P>
<P>
   The Communications Workers of America represents about 72,500
Verizon workers. The International Brotherhood of Electrical
Workers represents 13,000 others.
</P>
<P>
   The union source said none of the major issues posed by union
negotiators has been addressed by Verizon in contract talks that
began June 26.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators moved the talks to Washington on Monday in
anticipation of the 12:01 a.m. EDT Sunday deadline. The union
source said little had been accomplished as of Wednesday afternoon,
however, and a company response on a variety of matters was
awaited.
</P>
<P>
   The CWA this week gave its president, Morton Bahr, authority to
call a strike if the deadline passes without agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the dispute was generated by the unions' demand for
member access to new jobs in the wireless operation.
</P>
<P>
   CWA representatives say differences in wages and benefits
between union and nonunion workers are significant. Verizon has
said the company needs flexibility to decide what it pays workers
in the rapidly growing field.
</P>
<P>
   An impasse Sunday could send operators and technicians to the
picket lines and leave 25 million homes and businesses without help
setting up phone services, repairing or installing lines or
figuring out their telephone bills.
</P>
<P>
   Verizon workers in 12 states and the District of Columbia are
represented. The states covered: Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont,
Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New York, New Jersey, Delaware,
Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia and West Virginia.

<HEADLINE> Diamond Origin Cerftification Urged  </HEADLINE>
By EDITH M. LEDERER
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- A year ago nobody talked about ''blood
diamonds.'' Now, the issue of illegally mined diamonds that are
fueling wars across Africa has become a top priority for the
diamond industry, the world's leading powers and the U.N. Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
   A two-day U.N. hearing this week has increased momentum for a
global system to certify the origin of diamonds so dealers can keep
''blood diamonds'' that fuel wars in Sierra Leone, Congo and Angola
off of jewelers' shelves.
</P>
<P>
   ''The whole diamond industry has focused on the huge downside to
the industry if the world public turn against conflict diamonds,
and therefore turn against diamonds,'' Britain's U.N. Ambassador
Jeremy Greenstock said Wednesday. ''They're also genuinely
concerned not to be part of fueling a conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting two weeks ago in Antwerp, Belgium, the
international diamond industry adopted strict new measures that
track diamonds from mines in conflict areas to the jewelry store
and announced a ban on dealers that buy or sell ''blood diamonds.''
</P>
<P>
   The push to stop ''blood diamonds'' started with a ban last year
on diamonds sold by Angola's UNITA rebels.
</P>
<P>
   In early July, the Security Council banned the purchase of
Sierra Leone diamonds without a government certificate in a bid to
strangle the ability of the rebel Revolutionary United Front to
finance the civil war, which has killed and maimed tens of
thousands.
</P>
<P>
   Diamonds also play a role in fueling the conflict in Congo, but
there is no ban affecting that country.
</P>
<P>
   At this week's U.N. hearing, Sierra Leone's Minister for Mineral
Resources Mohammed Deen presented a new government certificate
developed with the United States, Britain, Belgium, Israel and the
Diamond High Council in Antwerp. He also announced new procedures
for the mining and export of rough diamonds.
</P>
<P>
   Bangladesh's U.N. Ambassador Anwarul Chowdhury, who chairs the
Security Council committee monitoring sanctions against Sierra
Leone, said it will meet by early next week to examine the proposed
certification procedures. If approved, they should be immediately
implemented, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Sierra Leone proposal has now emerged as a possible model
for global certification of diamonds, after it won overwhelming
approval from the representatives from the diamond industry,
governments, and voluntary organizations who attended the U.N.
hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ''A global regime is necessary if we want to get rid of the
conflict diamonds,'' Chowdhury said Tuesday at the close of the
hearing Tuesday, which was organized by the sanctions committee.
</P>
<P>
   At last month's meeting of the seven major industrial powers and
Russia in Okinawa, Britain and Russia announced that they will host
a conference of about 30 diamond producing countries by the end of
September in Moscow to establish an international legal basis for
regulating the diamond trade.
</P>
<P>
   The conference will be followed by the introduction of a General
Assembly resolution in the autumn to start a formal treaty
negotiating process under U.N. auspices, British officials said.
</P>
<P>
   A five-member panel just named by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan will work with the diamond industry in perfecting
arrangements for a certificate of origin, Greenstock, the British
ambassador said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope that the diamond industry will respond by making this
certificate of origin regime universal so that everybody selling a
diamond has to show a certificate that they got it legitimately,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The same panel is to collect information on possible violations
of the ''blood diamond'' ban and report them to the Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Ambassador Richard Holbrooke said the message about the
deadly effects of ''blood diamonds'' must now get to the buying
public.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that the world has only recently begun to recognize
that diamonds, the most beautiful of all gem stones, are also a
deadly component of some of the worst conflicts on earth,'' he
said.

<HEADLINE> Fifth OSU Football Player Arrested  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CORVALLIS, Ore. (AP) -- A fifth Oregon State football player
turned himself into police Wednesday in the beating of another
student.
</P>
<P>
   Redshirt freshman linebacker Noah Happe, 19, was charged with
third-degree assault.
</P>
<P>
   Freshman cornerback Dennis Weathersby turned himself in to
police Tuesday. Three Oregon State receivers -- Robert Prescott,
Alton ''Junior'' Adams and James Newson -- are also charged in the
case.
</P>
<P>
   All have been charged with third-degree assault, a Class C
felony that carries a maximum prison term of five years.
</P>
<P>
   The players are accused of beating 21-year-old Victor Becerra at
a Corvallis house party on July 22.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Dennis Erickson could not be reached Wednesday to confirm
Weatherby's and Happe's status with the team. After Prescott and
Adams were arrested, Erickson announced they were suspended
indefinitely from competition. Newsom was not suspended.

<HEADLINE> Fisherman has close encounter with black bear  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ELMIRA, N.Y. (AP) - A 200-pound black bear went fishing and
nearly caught the fisherman.
</P>
<P>
   Brad Taylor had hooked five smallmouth bass Monday night when he
noticed another hungry mammal looking to relieve the Chemung River
of a few fish.
</P>
<P>
   The bear, fresh from a snack at a neighbor's bird feeder, had
ambled over to the river in southern central New York, most likely
looking for more food as it begins its winter preparations,
according to a scientist.
</P>
<P>
   Bears eat meat and vegetation but aren't predators, said Bruce
Penrod of the state Department of Environmental Conservation. This
bear probably had been fed so often by humans, it had lost its
natural wariness.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, on the other hand, was plenty wary.
</P>
<P>
   ''My first reaction -- just like anybody else's would be -- was
to run,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He headed straight into the river, with the bear behind. About
halfway across, the bear got snagged in some brush, allowing the
angler to scramble up a bank to a neighbor's house.
</P>
<P>
   The chase surprised Penrod, who said bears rarely charge humans.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a strong message out of this,'' Penrod said. ''Cease
and desist feeding the bears.''
</P>
<P>
   Elmira is 75 miles southwest of Syracuse.

<HEADLINE> Man discovered burned to death in bed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HOBOKEN, N.J. (AP) - Police were questioning a female friend of
a 68-year-old disabled man found burned to death in his bed
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Harry Dennis, 68, was burned over approximately 80 percent of
his body, said Deputy First Assistant Hudson County Prosecutor
Edward DeFazio.
</P>
<P>
   A Meals-on-Wheels employee who arrived to deliver food to Dennis
on Wednesday found Dennis' body and his female friend in his
apartment, DeFazio said.
</P>
<P>
   The woman told police that Dennis died Wednesday by carelessly
igniting a cigarette after applying rubbing alcohol on himself,
DeFazio said.
</P>
<P>
   But an autopsy that determined Dennis burned to death could not
pinpoint the time of his death, DeFazio said.
</P>
<P>
   DeFazio wouldn't call the woman a suspect and said investigators
have yet to determine whether Dennis' death was an accident or not.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis was disabled and occasionally required a wheelchair,
DeFazio said.

<HEADLINE> Officer accused of trying to entice a child to engage in sexual activity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) - A New York City police officer who
allegedly sent a picture of himself in a police cruiser to someone
he thought was a 14-year-old girl was charged Wednesday with trying
to entice a child to engage in sexual activity.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Amatulli, 25, an officer since April 15, 1997, was taken
into custody at his Bronxville home on federal charges that he used
interstate communications to commit the crime. He was suspended
without pay, police said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors alleged that he used Internet chat rooms to try to
meet young girls and then persuade them to have sexual relations
with him.
</P>
<P>
   Amatulli appeared in White Plains before U.S. Magistrate Judge
Lisa M. Smith, who released him on $150,000 bail.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're confident that when all these surrounding facts and
circumstances about this case come to light that my client will be
vindicated,'' said his lawyer, Rene Medina. A prosecutor in the
case did not immediately return a telephone message.
</P>
<P>
   Smith also ordered Amatulli to surrender his weapons, barred him
from using the Internet and ordered him to have no unsupervised
contact with minors.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said a search warrant executed at his home on July
20 found that Amatulli had stored hundreds of images of child
pornography on his home computer.
</P>
<P>
   The arrest resulted after an investigation that began when
Amatulli allegedly established Internet contact with a person he
believed to be a 14-year-old girl living in the Washington D.C.
area.
</P>
<P>
   The person, prosecutors said in court papers, was actually a
U.S. Customs Service special agent.
</P>
<P>
   A complaint filed in U.S. District Court in White Plains said
Amatulli tried to entice the agent during several Internet and
telephone conversations to engage in sexual intercourse.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint alleged that Amatulli claimed he had recently met
a 12-year-old girl over the Internet and had sex with her.
</P>
<P>
   When the Customs agent told him she had reservations about
having intercourse, Amatulli allegedly promised she would not get
pregnant and said he would send a picture of himself in his uniform
and his police car to make her feel more at ease, according to the
complaint.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Amatulli used e-mail to send the agent two pictures of
himself in a New York City police uniform and seated in a New York
City police car.

<HEADLINE> 101 Dead in Attacks in Kashmir  </HEADLINE>
By QAISER MIRZA
<TEXT>
<P>
   PAHALGAM, India (AP) -- Suspected Islamic guerrillas mowed down
Hindu pilgrims, police said Wednesday, launching a 24-hour wave of
violence that left 101 people dead and the prospect of peace
shattered in the Himalayan province of Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   A cease-fire by Kashmir's largest guerrilla group had raised a
glimmer of hope for peace after 11 years of fighting: Kashmiri
families and tourists had begun venturing out to the picturesque
spots in a province renowned for snowcapped mountains, mirror
lakes, fruit orchards and rushing rivers. On Tuesday and Wednesday,
some of those same spots were among those bloodied by massacres.
</P>
<P>
   Indian officials quickly blamed Pakistan-based guerrillas for
the deaths, while witnesses said some of those killed were the
victims of reprisal shootings by Indian forces. Pakistan, which
seeks control of Kashmir, said such killings have been carried out
in the past by Indian paramilitary groups.
</P>
<P>
   In the first and worst attack, eight guerrillas managed to sneak
into a crowd of unarmed Hindu pilgrims and Muslim porters on their
way to a religious shrine near Pahalgam, 55 miles south of
Kashmir's summer capital, Srinagar. They burst into a makeshift
kitchen by a river just after dusk and began firing automatic
rifles at pilgrims huddled over their meager supper of fried bread
and potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   Indian security forces alert for attacks at the religious shrine
retaliated. In 20 minutes of nonstop firing, 35 people, two of them
Kashmiri militants, were killed and 94 others were injured.
</P>
<P>
   Shops were looted in the aftermath and people wandered around
wailing as they searched for relatives and friends. Bloodstains
could be seen on the wooden bridges over the ice-blue Lidder River.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had seen this only in the movies,'' said G.L. Atri, a
devotee who survived. ''Four people were killed in front of me.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the latest addition to years of bloodshed in this
province, which is divided between nuclear-armed neighbors India
and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   The nations have fought two wars over Kashmir, and Muslim
guerrilla groups on the Indian side have been fighting since 1989
to separate the region from Indian control. About 25,000 people
have died, and the rebellion has left the region economically and
socially scarred.
</P>
<P>
   The largest militant group, the Hezb-ul Mujahedeen, called a
cease-fire July 17, and India quickly agreed to talks. But the new
violence spotlighted how smaller militant groups -- many of which
oppose the Hezb-ul Mujahedeen cease-fire -- can continue the fight.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee blamed the smaller militant
groups for the massacres.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is clear that after Hezb-ul Mujahedeen's step and talks of
a cease-fire, militant groups directed by Pakistan have decided to
step up the attacks,'' Vajpayee told Parliament on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton called Vajpayee to express sympathies over the
killings and commended him ''for continuing to pursue a path of
peace even in spite of yesterday's attack,'' said P.J. Crowley, a
White House spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses and survivors of the shooting that killed the 35
pilgrims and porters said Indian paramilitary police and soldiers
were responsible for many of the deaths.
</P>
<P>
   ''I saw two men in a Kashmir police uniform who started firing
from a bridge and on the bus,'' said bus driver Balbir Singh, who
brought the pilgrims to Pahalgam. ''I saw two Hindu priests killed
before me, and two other men.''
</P>
<P>
   A forest guard, Farookh Ahmed, was one of several people who
said officers of the paramilitary Central Reserve Police Force
killed civilians and dragged people out of tents to beat or shoot
them in revenge for the militant attack.
</P>
<P>
   ''The CRPF men forced us out and started shooting at us,'' Ahmed
said. ''I ducked and survived, two were killed in front of me, two
were injured. Tourists (Hindu pilgrims) were not brought out and we
were because we are Kashmiris.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been several previous cases when police in Kashmir
have blamed militants for attacks despite witnesses' insistence
that it was government forces who did the killing.
</P>
<P>
   Ashok Bhan, the Kashmir police commander, said ''there could be
a few cases'' of CRPF attacks on civilians. ''But there is no
evidence that there was any excessive use of force by the CRPF.''
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan's Foreign Ministry condemned the killings, saying that
''on previous occasions, terrorist acts aimed at civilians have
been carried out by renegade elements at the behest of Indian
security forces to malign the Kashmiri freedom struggle
internationally.''
</P>
<P>
   The comments highlighted the continuing disagreements between
India and Pakistan over Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   Many guerrilla groups that emerged when the Islamic insurrection
began in 1989 openly championed merging Kashmir with Pakistan.
India says Pakistan trains and arms the guerrillas to fight a proxy
war, while Pakistan says it only gives moral support to the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   The attack at the Amarnath cave, the shrine near Pahalgam, was
the worst of nine reported on Tuesday and Wednesday. In
simultaneous attacks in other villages in southern Kashmir, the
guerrillas stormed houses in remote villages, sometimes lining up
the people they found and shooting them at point-blank range.
</P>
<P>
   Amnesty International condemned the violence in a statement from
London that said political dissent ''should never take the form of
killing innocent civilians who are used as pawns to score a point
or undermine the other side's gains.''
</P>
<P>
   Saleem Hashmi, a spokesman of the Hezb-ul Mujahedeen in
Pakistan's capital, Islamabad, said none of the militant groups
could be involved.
</P>
<P>
   ''No mujahedeen (holy warriors) group can kill civilians,'' he
said. ''Whosoever has done it we condemn it.''

<HEADLINE> Reds Pitcher Dehydrates, Passes Out  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Cincinnati right-hander Elmer Dessens passed out
while walking to the team bus Wednesday and was treated for
dehydration after he pitched seven innings of the Reds' 2-1 loss to
the New York Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Dessens (5-1) was taken to Mount Sinai Hospital to receive
fluids, the Reds said. He was released from the hospital later
Wednesday and flew home to Cincinnati, Reds media relations
director Rob Butcher said.
</P>
<P>
   The game, which began at 12:10 EDT, was played in very humid
conditions with a gametime temperature of 78 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second medical scare for the Reds in the three-game
series at Shea Stadium. Pitching coach Don Gullett rejoined the
team for Wednesday's game, two days after he experienced tightness
in his chest.
</P>
<P>
   He was released from New York Medical Center late Tuesday night,
following a series of tests. The 49-year-old coach said doctors
ruled out a heart attack. He had a heart attack in 1986 and
underwent triple-bypass surgery in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Dessens allowed two runs -- Robin Ventura's first-inning homer --
on six hits Wednesday. He struck out five and walked one. He had
won four straight starts after taking the spot in the Reds'
rotation created by their July 12 trade of Denny Neagle to the New
York Yankees.

<P>
   TERRE HAUTE, Ind. (AP) -- The Indianapolis Colts placed Rob Renes
on the injured reserve list Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Renes, a defensive tackle taken in the seventh round of the 2000
draft, has a stress fracture in his back. He suffered the injury
during practice last week and an MRI performed Tuesday determined
its seriousness.
</P>
<P>
   Renes, a 6-foot-1, 308-pounder who played at Michigan, was the
first of two seventh-round picks by Indianapolis.

<HEADLINE> Nilsson Released by Japanese Team  </HEADLINE>
By BEN WALKER
<TEXT>
<P>
   David Nilsson hopes he hits better at the Sydney Olympics than
he did in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Nilsson, an All-Star catcher with the Milwaukee Brewers in 1999,
was released by the Chunichi Dragons after a season-long slump that
saw him sent to the Japanese minors.
</P>
<P>
   Nilsson, 30, asked the Dragons to cancel his one-year contract,
and they immediately obliged, team spokesman Testsuo Ishiguro said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''He felt his performance wasn't as good as expected,'' said
Ishiguro.
</P>
<P>
   Nilsson hit only .180 with one home run and eight RBIs for the
Dragons. He was sent down to the minors in late April.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, Nilsson was bothered by lower back pain. The
Australian native returned home for a short time to be checked.
</P>
<P>
   Ishiguro said Nilsson planned to travel back to the United
States, though no timetable was set for his trip.
</P>
<P>
   It is still expected Nilsson will play for Australia in the
Olympics. There is a reasonable chance he'll be back in the
American majors next year.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not surprised,'' Milwaukee outfielder Marquis Grissom
said. ''That's a big adjustment. It's a different kind of
baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope he comes back over here because he's definitely a big
league player. He could sign with us again,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nilsson batted .309 with 21 home runs and 62 RBIs for Milwaukee
last season. He was a lifetime .284 hitter with 105 homers in an
eight-year career, spent entirely with the Brewers.
</P>
<P>
   Nilsson, however, left the majors after making it clear he
wanted to play for his homeland in the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   The Summer Games start in September. This is the first time
American professional teams will let players compete in the
Olympics, but clubs are not letting their top stars take part.
</P>
<P>
   Nilsson signed with Chunichi in mid-January for a reported $2
million. As part of his deal with the Dragons, he was going to be
allowed to play for Australia in the Olympics and then become a
free agent.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a dream come true for me. This is what I wanted,''
Nilsson said when he agreed to terms in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   Nilsson, the first Australian major leaguer ever to play
Japanese ball, was expected to post big numbers for Chunichi. He
was popular at the start and became known by the nickname
''Dingo.''
</P>
<P>
   But despite his big salary -- by Japanese standards -- and big
numbers for the Brewers, he got off to a slow start and never
recovered.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm sure he could have gotten a job here, so I'm not even sure
why he went over there,'' Milwaukee pitcher Jeff D'Amico said.
''The guy can hit, so I'm surprised he did so poorly over there.
That's strange.''
</P>
<P>
   A left-handed hitting catcher with pop, Nilsson likely would
have no trouble finding a job in the majors. He made $5.7 million
with the Brewers in 1999.

   CAMP PENDLETON, Calif. (AP) -- A 21-year-old Marine died and a
midshipman was injured during a nighttime training accident,
military officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Cpl. Jeremy J. Fulk of New London, Iowa, died Tuesday night when

<HEADLINE> Brazil Rains Kill At Least 45  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- Five days of heavy rains that triggered
deadly mudslides and flooding in northeastern Brazil eased
Wednesday, but authorities said the death toll rose to 45.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands more in Pernambuco and Alagoas states were also driven
from their homes by the rising waters, bringing the number seeking
shelter in schools, churches and with friends to about 100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Globo TV showed entire towns partially submerged in water. Other
images showed people wading through waist high water trying to
salvage whatever they could.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was perhaps the worst natural disaster ever to hit
Pernambuco,'' civil defense official Carlos D'Alburquerque said by
phone from the state capital of Recife, about 1,300 miles northeast
of Sao Paulo.
</P>
<P>
   ''Roads, highways and bridges have been washed away and the only
way to rescue countless others who are isolated is by boat and
helicopter,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the dead were caught by huge mudslides that plowed
through mostly poor homes perched precariously on hills.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest deaths, 18 people were killed in Pernambuco,
D'Alburquerque said without elaborating. About 50,000 there have
fled their homes.
</P>
<P>
   In the neighboring Alagoas, the mudslides that ravaged hillside
shantytowns killed 27 people and drove 52,000 from their homes,
said Soraya Alves Leite, a spokeswoman for the state government.
</P>
<P>
   The rains let up on Wednesday but both D'Alburquerque and Leite
said the skies were overcast and more downpours were expected.
</P>
<P>
   Military troops joined in the rescue effort, retrieving trapped
people and distributing food, water and medicine to the homeless.

<HEADLINE> One man arrested in 1999 death of graduate student  </HEADLINE>
By DONNA DE LA CRUZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - More than a year after a graduate student was
fatally stabbed in the back with a 10-inch kitchen knife as she
walked to her Brooklyn apartment, police on Wednesday announced an
arrest in the case.
</P>
<P>
   David Jamison, 27, of Brooklyn, has been charged with
first-degree murder, first-degree robbery and criminal possession
of a weapon in Amy Watkins' death. Police also questioned two other
men in the case at the 77th Precinct in Brooklyn, but did not
immediately charge them with any crime.
</P>
<P>
   Jamison was picked up for questioning Wednesday thanks to
several tips to police, including some from the Crime Stoppers hot
line. He was previously arrested for selling drugs, petit larceny
and robbery.
</P>
<P>
   A police source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Jamison and two other men saw Watkins walk by the restaurant they
were in on March 8, 1999, and decided she would be an easy robbery
target. Watkins apparently struggled with her attacker and she was
stabbed once, the source said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Watkins, the victim's father, said in a telephone
interview from his Manhattan home that he was completely surprised
when police called him about 1 p.m. Wednesday to tell them about
the arrest.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought someday something would happen, but I really didn't
have a lot of hope,'' he said. He expressed gratitude to the police
for never giving up on the case.
</P>
<P>
   His daughter's death horrified the city and her neighbors in
Prospect Heights, a quiet neighborhood of gentrified brownstones a
short subway ride from Manhattan. Her death came at a time when the
city was in the midst of a dramatic decrease in violent crime.
</P>
<P>
   Watkins, 26 and from Kansas, was studying for her masters in
social work, counseling battered women and working with children as
an intern at the New Settlement Community Center in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   She had taken the subway from the Bronx, where she organized a
meeting for parents about their children's reading scores. She was
attacked as she walked home from the subway station, after stopping
for some groceries shortly before 10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   She was unconscious when passers-by found her on the sidewalk -
some residents said they heard a woman scream. Watkins lived with a
roommate in an apartment building about two blocks from where she
was stabbed.
</P>
<P>
   She was born in Illinois but raised in Topeka, Kan., and
graduated from the University of Kansas. She moved to New York in
1997 after living briefly in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Watkins was a second-year graduate student at Hunter College's
School of Social Work, had an internship at the center and had
started working there in September 1998.
</P>
<P>
   She was buried in suburban St. Louis, where her mother, Margaret
Tafoya, and her stepfather, John Tafoya, live. Lawrence Watkins
teaches at Dominican Academy in Manhattan.

<HEADLINE> 15 more birds confirmed to have West Nile Virus in NYC  </HEADLINE>
By DONNA DE LA CRUZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Fifteen more birds in New York City - 13 of them
on Staten Island - have been diagnosed with the West Nile Virus,
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Ground spraying had already been scheduled for the island
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The two birds most recently found infected in Manhattan were in
Central Park and in Washington Heights at 155th Street, Giuliani
said.
</P>
<P>
   Rockland County - which yielded the first infected fowl of the
season and still has the highest tally in the area - added 10 more
sick birds to its list of 48, the county executive's office said.
Most of the latest batch were in Clarkstown.
</P>
<P>
   In Westchester, a blue jay found dead in Yonkers last month was
the 11th county bird to test positive for the virus, the county
Health Department said.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year the virus has appeared only in birds and
mosquitoes - bloodsucking insects that can spread West Nile to
humans. City Health Commissioner Neal L. Cohen said the city has
ruled out 160 cases of people who had come down with West Nile-like
symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   While some people infected with West Nile show no symptoms,
others suffer from a flu-like condition that can include high
fever, gastrointestinal problems, muscle ache, headache, or mental
confusion. West Nile can also cause encephalitis, a swelling of the
brain.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, with Queens as the epicenter, the first U.S. case of
West Nile was reported in late August; a total of seven people in
the New York area died and 62 were infected.
</P>
<P>
   The virus is commonly found in Africa, Eastern Europe, West Asia
and the Middle East. Its appearance in the New York area last year
prompted a massive campaign of aerial and ground spraying to kill
mosquitoes.
</P>
<P>
   Central Park, Alley Pond Park in Queens, and the area of
Manhattan and the Bronx north of 110th Street and south of Dyckman
Street, were scheduled to be sprayed with insecticide Friday night.
Central Park and Alley Pond Park have been sprayed before, but
additional mosquitoes were found afterward, Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of birds infected with West Nile have been found on
Staten Island, but Giuliani said no one knows yet why the borough
seems to be the hotbed for the virus.
</P>
<P>
   ''The commissioner (Cohen) the other day came to the conclusion
that a lot of the activity is located there - if you want to call
it the epicenter, that would be a fair conclusion,'' the mayor
said.
</P>
<P>
   To date, a total of 31 West Nile-infected birds have been found
in all five boroughs - 26 in Staten Island, three in Queens and two
in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Wednesday, Suffolk County officials announced that 12
more birds there tested positive for the virus, bringing the total
to 15 this year.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani again said it would be helpful if New Jersey
communities would conduct precautionary spraying for mosquitos.
</P>
<P>
   ''We talk to them and we make recommendations, but it's their
decision,'' he said. ''It's a medical, scientific, and I guess,
ultimately a political decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in Rockland and Westchester counties, no new spraying
was announced because the areas where the birds were found have
already been sprayed. Spraying was planned for Wednesday night in
Ardsley and parts of Ossining and White Plains.
</P>
<P>
   In Rockland County, spraying was scheduled for Wednesday night
in New Square and parts of Spring Valley, Kaser and New Hemstead.

<HEADLINE> Report: Pinochet's Immunity Revoked  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) -- Chile's Supreme Court has stripped Gen.
Augusto Pinochet of immunity from prosecution, paving the way for
the former dictator to stand trial on human rights charges, a
lawyer and an official close to Pinochet said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The court refused to publicly release its ruling. But lawyer
Hugo Gutierrez, who represents one of the plaintiffs accusing the
84-year-old general of rights abuses, said he had ''fully
confirmed'' the Supreme Court justices removed Pinochet's immunity
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   An official at the Pinochet Foundation, a private group of
Pinochet supporters and former aides, also said it was clear
Pinochet had lost.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet faces 154 criminal complaints stemming from human
rights abuses during his 1973-90 dictatorship, but he cannot be
tried unless his congressional legal immunity is removed.
</P>
<P>
   A lower court stripped Pinochet of that immunity earlier this
year, and Pinochet appealed. The Supreme Court's 20 justices met
for four hours Tuesday to hear the appeal but did not release a
decision afterward.
</P>
<P>
   The justices ''maintain our agreement not to give any
information whatsoever until the legal ruling has been written and
signed by all of us,'' Chief Justice Hernan Alvarez said Wednesday.
He said an announcement could come next week.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the official secrecy, Chilean media reports said the
court turned down Pinochet's appeal, and many said the vote was
11-9 against Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
   According to an official tally, 3,190 people were killed during
Pinochet's regime, and more than 1,000 remain missing after being
arrested during those years.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Juan Guzman, who is probing complaints from relatives of
the missing, is seeking Pinochet's trial in one of the most
notorious incidents -- the so-called ''caravan of death.'' That was
the name given to a military squad that summarily executed 72
political prisoners in several cities shortly after Pinochet's
bloody 1973 coup.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the Chilean military made an unprecedented promise
to help determine what happened to the more than 1,000 dissidents
who disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   That pledge appeared to begin yielding results Wednesday, when
Methodist Bishop Enrique Vilches delivered to the government what
he described as information on 780 of the missing. He said the
information was received by members of his church from former
military and secret police officials.
</P>
<P>
   Details on the information Vilches turned over were not
immediately available.
</P>
<P>
   The military made its promise to help unravel the fates of the
missing in an agreement with government officials and human rights
activists. The agreement included a guarantee of anonymity for
those coming forward with information.
</P>
<P>
   Chilean exiles and human rights groups in Britain celebrated the
report. Pinochet left Britain in March after he was declared
mentally unfit to be extradited to Spain on torture charges, ending
a 16-month legal saga.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is wonderful news for Chile and for all the people who
suffered so much under his regime,'' said Carlos Reyas, spokesman
for Chile Democratico and Chileans in Exile. ''We are hoping that
this will open the door and get our missing ones back to their
families.''

<HEADLINE> Pacers Re-Sign Rose and Croshere  </HEADLINE>
By STEVE HERMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Jalen Rose, the NBA's most improved player
last season, and Austin Croshere, who blossomed into one of the
league's top reserves with his strong performance in the finals,
re-signed with the Indiana Pacers on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Rose signed a 7-year deal worth $93 million, according to his
agent, David Falk. Croshere, a bench-warmer most of his first two
seasons in the NBA, reportedly signed for $51 million over seven
years.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a very surreal moment,'' Croshere said. ''I don't think
it's sunk in. Throughout the negotiations, hearing the numbers
thrown out, it's kind of like Monopoly money at that point.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Croshere, who visited several other teams to test his
value as a free agent, Rose neither talked with nor considered any
other offers.
</P>
<P>
   ''My head and heart the entire time was to be an Indiana
Pacer,'' he said. ''I said from the beginning that I was going to
continue to remain an Indiana Pacer and try to do what I could to
help this team and city win a championship.''
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-8 Rose, who moved into the Pacers' starting lineup at
small forward last season, displaced Reggie Miller as the team's
leading scorer, averaging 18.2 points.
</P>
<P>
   Rose came to Indiana in a 1996 trade with Denver and spent most
of his time on the bench for then-coach Larry Brown. Rose began
getting more playing time the next year, after Larry Bird replaced
Brown, and he became a top reserve in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   He emerged as a star after he replaced veteran Chris Mullin in
Indiana's starting lineup, and he averaged 20.8 points during the
playoffs, with a career-high 40 points against Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Rose, who did not attend the news conference at Conseco
Fieldhouse Wednesday night -- he had to catch a plane -- said in a
statement the recent hiring of Isiah Thomas to replace Bird also
had a part in his decision to stay.
</P>
<P>
   ''The coach is a big part of any team,'' said Rose, who grew up
watching Thomas play for his hometown Detroit Pistons. ''He is the
guy who dictates playing time. He is the guy who dictates the style
of play.
</P>
<P>
   ''Anytime you replace a guy like Larry Bird and you replace him
with a Hall of Famer, like we did, it made the opportunity to
remain a Pacer a lot more attractive,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Perkins re-signed Tuesday for one year at about $2.5
million, and the Pacers expect to re-sign at least two of their
three other free agents -- Miller, Mark Jackson and Rik Smits.
Contract talks with Smits have been delayed while he decides
whether he wants to retire.
</P>
<P>
   Croshere averaged 10.3 points and 6.4 rebounds in 81 games last
season, when the Pacers reached the NBA Finals for the first time.
He had a career-high 24 points in Game 2 of the finals against the
Los Angeles Lakers and averaged 15.2 points and 6.0 rebounds off
the bench in the series, which the Pacers lost in six games.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-9 Croshere -- a first-round draft pick out of Providence in
1997 -- became a top reserve last season after seeing limited action
in his first two years in the league. He reportedly was offered
more than $50 million over six years by the Toronto Raptors.
</P>
<P>
   ''The opportunity to finish the business we started last year
was a huge part,'' he said of his decision to stay with Indiana.
''Being in the finals was the most important thing I've done as a
basketball player, and the opportunity to get back there far
outweighed any of the positives the other teams could have
offered.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller, who will be starting his 14th year in the NBA, earned
more than $9 million last season and reportedly wants a three- or
four-year deal that would keep him with the Pacers the rest of his
career.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, also a 13-year veteran, is likely to get a raise over
his $4 million salary, but the length of his contract is under
discussion.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are serious about having last season's team back,'' general
manager David Kahn said. ''We're working hard to get it done as
quickly as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Kahn described talks with agents representing the players as
amicable.
</P>
<P>
   ''In some cases we're crunching numbers. This is a long process
for us because our situation is unique with six free agents,'' he
said.

<HEADLINE> Veterans take stand against landfill near memorial  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   AVA, N.Y. - A group of veterans is camped out in a memorial
forest here, a peaceful protest against a proposed landfill a
quarter-mile away.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Willson, along with a group of veterans who call themselves
''Veterans Defending Our Memorial Forest,'' is fighting a landfill
proposed by the Oneida-Herkimer Solid Waste Management Authority.
Part of the landfill would be located about 1,400 feet from the
edge of the 800-acre Oneida County-owned forest, 42 miles northeast
of Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   ''In Vietnam, I didn't know what I was fighting for. Here, I
do,'' said the 56-year-old veteran who proposed to his wife about
30 years ago in the forest.
</P>
<P>
   Willson was one of about 50 local veterans who have taken a
stand against the proposed landfill. The veterans have camped out
on the site since Sunday in protest and expect to stay until at
least Aug. 10 when the state Department of Environmental
Conservation conducts two public hearings on the issue. The DEC has
the authority to site the landfill.
</P>
<P>
   Authority board member Gerald C. Brodock, himself a veteran,
told the Utica Observer-Dispatch: ''I understand what (the
veterans) position is, but I don't agree with it. I don't believe
having a landfill that far away would desecrate it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ken Martin, a retired Marine, said the tallest trees surrounding
the monument are about 60- to 70-feet tall, or about a third as
tall as the proposed landfill.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our memorial will be dwarfed by garbage,'' Martin said.
''Trash will blow onto the memorial. Rats and vermin will run over
this sacred land.''

<HEADLINE> Tigers 5, Angels 3  </HEADLINE>
By BETH HARRIS
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Brian Moehler held Anaheim scoreless on
six hits through the first seven innings and Bobby Higginson hit a
two-run homer as the Detroit Tigers defeated the Angels 5-3 on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Moehler (7-7) was charged with one run and struck out five. He
walked his only batter leading off Anaheim's three-run eighth
inning before he was replaced by C.J. Nitkowski -- despite throwing
only 84 pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Moehler struggled in his previous start at Texas on July 28,
giving up 10 runs on 11 hits in 2 2-3 innings. The right-hander
yielded at least 11 hits in three of his previous four starts. He
worked with runners on base in each of the first six innings, but
allowed a runner past second only once.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim's Tim Salmon was 4-for-4 for the second time in the
three-game series, in which he was 10-for-12 overall.
</P>
<P>
   Higginson gave Detroit a 2-0 lead in the first with his 21st
homer on a 2-1 pitch from Ken Hill (5-7). Detroit capitalized on
Hill's throwing error, coming on a sacrifice bunt by Shane Halter,
to score three runs in the fifth. Former Angel Damion Easley hit a
two-run single and Dean Palmer made it 5-0 with a sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   Salmon had an RBI single off Doug Brocail in the eighth,
followed by Garret Anderson's two-run double over the outstretched
glove of a leaping Higginson at the left field fence.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Jones pitched the ninth for his AL-leading 31st save in 33
chances.
</P>
<P>
   Hill is winless in his last five consecutive starts. The
right-hander gave up five runs on seven hits in six innings, while
walking three and striking out two.
</P>
<P>
   While the Angels couldn't score any runs, left fielder Darin
Erstad and Adam Kennedy made sparkling defensive plays. Erstad's
diving catch in the second robbed Halter of extra bases, while
second baseman Kennedy fielded Juan Gonzalez's grounder up the
middle and made a nice backhanded flip to Benji Gil for the force
on Higginson.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Anaheim C Matt Walbeck threw out two Detroit runners after
the Tigers were 18 of 19 in stolen-base attempts. ... Hill allowed
a homer for the sixth straight game and his ERA hasn't been under
6.00 since his third start of the season. ... Juan Encarnacion
became only the second batter hit by Hill in 77 2-3 innings. ...
Detroit improved to 42-17 when scoring four or more runs. ...
Starting Friday in Cleveland, Anaheim plays 32 of its remaining 53
on the road. ... RHP Matt Wise made his major league debut for the
Angels in the seventh, a day after being promoted from Triple-A
Edmonton. ... Angels All-Star 3B Troy Glaus, who batted only .194
in July, did not benefit from getting a day off Tuesday. He
grounded out all four times up, including a grounder to shortstop
that ended Anaheim's eighth-inning rally.

<HEADLINE> NBA Roundup  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS SHERIDAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tim Duncan and Jalen Rose got ''the max.''
</P>
<P>
   Austin Croshere, a bench-warmer until this season, and Cuttino
Mobley and Rashard Lewis, a couple of former second-round draft
picks, did pretty well, too.
</P>
<P>
   On a day when agents said ''Show me the money'' and the owners
opened their wallets, Duncan, Rose, Croshere Lewis and Mobley
became very rich young men Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan signed a three-year deal with the San Antonio Spurs worth
$32.6 million, with an option for a fourth year that would make the
contract worth $45.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   ''Tim Duncan is officially a Spur,'' coach and general manager
Gregg Popovich said after San Antonio completed what was arguably
the most important transaction in franchise history.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan had been wooed by the Orlando Magic and came close to
accepting their offer, only to be swayed toward staying when
teammate David Robinson flew back to San Antonio from Hawaii last
month to make a last-ditch appeal to Duncan.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan could have signed for as many as seven years, but instead
chose to take a shorter deal with an eye toward getting a contract
worth well in excess of $100 million the next time he becomes a
free agent.
</P>
<P>
   Rose, however, chose long-term security as he signed a
seven-year deal worth $93 million to stay with Indiana, while
Croshere re-signed with the Pacers for a reported $51 million over
seven years.
</P>
<P>
   Mobley, who was coveted by the Toronto Raptors, instead decided
to stay with the Houston Rockets. He gets a six-year, $31 million
deal as a reward for being the only reserve in the NBA to rank
second on his team in scoring.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, who had a breakout series in last year's first round of
the playoffs as Seattle was eliminated by Utah in five games,
stayed with the Sonics for $13.3 million over three years.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a pretty easy decision,'' Lewis said. ''I can see
myself playing in Seattle my whole career.''
</P>
<P>
   Trade talk continued to swirl around the league as teams tried
to maneuver within the confines of the salary cap. The Magic's
signings of Grant Hill and Tracy McGrady were being held up as
Detroit and Orlando -- and Toronto and Orlando -- explored whether it
would be mutually beneficial to execute sign-and-trade deals rather
than simply signing the other teams' free agents.
</P>
<P>
   Hill has already verbally committed to Orlando, while two
members of the Magic -- Chucky Atkins and Ben Wallace -- have
committed to Detroit. If the Magic and Pistons find a way to swap
Hill for Atkins and Wallace -- with an additional player or two
thrown in, Orlando could clear enough additional salary cap room to
sign free agent forward Maurice Taylor of the Los Angeles Clippers.
</P>
<P>
   A sign-and-trade deal also would allow Hill and McGrady to get
annual raises of 12.5 percent rather than 10 percent. The same
would be true for McGrady, although it was unclear whether Orlando
and Toronto were pursuing a sign-and-trade deal with the same zeal
as the Pistons and Magic were.
</P>
<P>
   Other trade talk centered around the Lakers' need for a power
forward. Los Angeles was reportedly trying to acquire P.J. Brown
from Charlotte in a sign-and-trade deal for Glen Rice, with a
possible fallback deal sending Rice to Miami for Anthony Mason.
</P>
<P>
   Also rumored was a Lakers-Hawks trade sending Rice to Atlanta
for Lorenzen Wright.
</P>
<P>
   Portland forward Brian Grant spent the day trying to decide
whether he'd like to play in Cleveland. The Cavs and Trail Blazers
have discussed a sign-and-trade deal of Grant for Shawn Kemp, but
Grant would prefer to be dealt to the New York Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   Grant, who opted out of the final four years and $41 million of
his contract in Portland, met with Cavaliers officials on Tuesday
and listened to their pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ''He hasn't made a decision yet. We're hopeful he'll make one in
the next couple of days,'' said Grant's agent, Mark Bartelstein.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from keeping the best free agent on the market in San
Antonio, Popovich said the Spurs were ''real close'' to signing
Clippers free agent guard Derek Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson would move into San Antonio's starting lineup in place
of Mario Elie, strengthening the weakest spot in the Spurs' lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Rose was voted the league's most improved player last season
after moving into the starting lineup at small forward and
displacing Reggie Miller as the team's leading scorer, averaging
18.2 points a game.
</P>
<P>
   ''My head and heart the entire time was to be an Indiana
Pacer,'' said Rose, who didn't even consider an offer from another
team. ''I said from the beginning that I was going to continue to
remain an Indiana Pacer and try to do what I could to help this
team and city win a championship.''
</P>
<P>
   Croshere emerged as a star after he replaced veteran Chris
Mullin in Indiana's starting lineup, and he averaged 20.8 points
during the playoffs, with a career-high 40 points against
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a very surreal moment,'' Croshere said. ''I don't think
it's sunk in. Throughout the negotiations, hearing the numbers
thrown out, it's kind of like Monopoly money at that point.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller, who will be starting his 14th year in the NBA, earned
more than $9 million last season and reportedly wants a three- or
four-year deal. Mark Jackson, also a 13-year veteran, would like a
raise over his $4 million salary from last season.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are serious about having last season's team back,'' Indiana
general manager David Kahn said. ''We're working hard to get it
done as quickly as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Also Wednesday, Bulls guard Randy Brown agreed on a three-year
contract with the Boston Celtics for $7.5 million, and forward
Corie Blount agreed to re-sign with Phoenix for $3.2 million over
two years.

<HEADLINE> Sam Mack Says He's Innocent  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- Former NBA player Sam Mack, who was arrested in a
Chicago suburb in July on drug charges, said Wednesday he is
innocent and expects his name to be cleared.
</P>
<P>
   Mack also said he did not lead police on a high speed chase just
before he was arrested for possessing cocaine and marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   ''When everything comes out, I wonder what people will say
then,'' Mack told Houston TV station KRIV. ''I know they smeared my
name real bad. But you know I'm not ashamed because I didn't do
anything and I'm innocent.''
</P>
<P>
   Mack, released by the Golden State Warriors in March, was
arrested July 11 after officers said they found 19 bags of
marijuana in his car, along with some cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   Police said they stopped his car after Mack ran a stop sign and
took officers on a high-speed chase through Phoenix, Ill., a
Chicago suburb.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix Police Sgt. Derek Guess said he isn't surprised by
Mack's claims of innocence.
</P>
<P>
   ''Why would a guy that makes the money Sam Mack makes, why would
he try to avoid a traffic ticket? Obviously because he had
something in the trunk he shouldn't have had, which was marijuana
and cocaine,'' Guess said.
</P>
<P>
   Mack has a preliminary hearing Aug. 7 in Markham, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   Mack played six years in the NBA, including stints with San
Antonio, Houston, Vancouver and Golden State.

<HEADLINE> State investigation clears Escambia deputies in couple's deaths  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PENSACOLA, Fla. (AP) - A state investigation has cleared
sheriff's deputies of wrongdoing in a shootout with a lawyer and
his ex-wife, who killed her husband, then herself before both were
hit by police bullets, autopsies indicated.
</P>
<P>
   The murder-suicide occurred during a gun battle with Escambia
County deputies in a tire store's parking lot following a car chase
on March 24.
</P>
<P>
   Justin Haberski, 40, a former FBI agent, and Jennifer Haberski,
29, were being sought as suspects in a robbery.
</P>
<P>
   State Attorney Curtis Golden pronounced the case closed Tuesday
after reviewing an investigative report by the Florida Department
of Law Enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   Justin Haberski left a note to his family in his car. He wrote
that ''Jennifer was not my downfall,'' expressed his love for his
family and ended with the post-script: ''Remember the movie rights
for the kids.''
</P>
<P>
   ''There's an implication that it was written in the
contemplation of death,'' Golden said.
</P>
<P>
   Escambia deputies have been involved in shoot-outs that have
resulted in the deaths of nine suspects, not counting the
Haberskis, over the past five years. The U.S. Justice Department
and FBI are investigating the shooting of an unarmed black suspect
last year for possible civil rights law violations.
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff Jim Lowman said he was satisfied with Golden's
conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to let the citizens and our officers know we didn't
fire the fatal shots,'' Lowman said. ''We never make any
assumptions until we get the full report, but we thought from the
preliminary investigation that it would turn out that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Agents of the Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms
also were looking for the couple on the day of the shooting for
questioning about an arson fire two days earlier at a Pensacola
strip club partly owned by Justin Haberski.
</P>
<P>
   Deputies got a report that four people were being robbed near a
shopping mall. During a 13-minute chase that followed, Jennifer
Haberski stood up through the car's sunroof and shot at pursing
officers with a 9 mm semiautomatic pistol.
</P>
<P>
   The couple had recently moved to New Orleans, where ATF agents
had spotted their car after the fire.
</P>
<P>
   Haberski was with the FBI in New York from 1984 through 1990
under name Stanley G. Haberski. His sister and parents live in
Panama City.

<HEADLINE> Bulls' Krause Has Little To Say  </HEADLINE>
By NANCY ARMOUR
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEERFIELD, Ill. (AP) -- On a day he's been waiting almost two
years for, Chicago Bulls general manager Jerry Krause had nothing
to say.
</P>
<P>
   Or very little, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   After being turned down by the top players available this
summer, Krause introduced the one free agent he was able to lure
and then quickly got out of the way.
</P>
<P>
   He left Ron Mercer and coach Tim Floyd on Wednesday afternoon,
saying, ''My phone is loaded right now. ... I've got phone calls
that have got to take me up to that phone room.''
</P>
<P>
   It's no wonder Krause didn't want to stick around.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with Michael Jordan's retirement and an aging team, Krause
and chairman Jerry Reinsdorf gutted the Bulls after they won their
sixth championship in eight years. Their hope was to stockpile
draft picks and get as far below the salary cap as they could so
they could lure marquee free agents.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago went a horrid 30-102 as the team looked toward this
summer, when Tim Duncan, Grant Hill, Tracy McGrady and Eddie Jones
would be available.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls began the free agent chase with almost $20 million in
salary cap room, enough that Krause was confident they could sign
two ''full-boat'' players. Only Orlando had similar money
available.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of flocking to Chicago, the top free agents went
elsewhere. Duncan stayed in San Antonio. Orlando is expected to
announce the formal signings of Hill and McGrady on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Jones convinced the Charlotte Hornets to send him to Miami in a
blockbuster sign-and-trade deal. Even Tim Thomas, who didn't start
for the Bucks last season, turned the Bulls down, opting instead to
stay in Milwaukee for less money.
</P>
<P>
   Mercer, who averaged 16.9 points last season, might have been on
the Bulls' wish list, but he was far from their first choice.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think he is really going to help our team,'' Krause said.
''This is a step forward for us. This is the first step forward
we're taking.''
</P>
<P>
   Mercer, the sixth overall pick in 1997, signed a deal worth $27
million over four years. That still leaves the Bulls with plenty of
money, but the number of free agents is dwindling quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a matter of just getting it started. Anything can
happen,'' Mercer said. ''We're not out of the recruiting process.
Something could happen tomorrow, something could happen a couple of
weeks from now.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that's the exciting part,'' he added. ''Things are
only going to go up. We're not going to go backwards.''
</P>
<P>
   Mercer said he wasn't concerned that so many other free agents
turned the Bulls down. He also isn't bothered by the animosity some
former players -- namely Jordan and Scottie Pippen -- have for Krause
and the Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not any of my business,'' Mercer said. ''That's the way I
look at it. That's those guys and when they were here. I have no
comment on that because it has nothing to do with me.''
</P>
<P>
   He also isn't put off by the prospect of playing for a
rebuilding team.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a challenge I want,'' he said. ''I'm glad to do it.
I'm glad to be here and take on that challenge. I want to be the
future and take this team to the future -- and repeat the past.''
</P>
<P>
   While McGrady expressed concern about the burden of replacing
Jordan, Mercer said he doesn't even think about that.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't look at it as trying to come in and fill Michael
Jordan's shoes. That's not my job. I can't do that,'' he said.
''This is a totally different team. This is not the Bulls of the
'90s. This is the rebuilding Bulls. And that's how I look at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mercer, who helped Kentucky reach the Final Four in each of his
two college seasons, will be playing for his fourth team in as many
years. He was drafted by the Boston Celtics, traded to Denver and
then dealt to Orlando last season.
</P>
<P>
   He's tired of moving, and said he was looking for a place where
he could settle down. He knew Chicago was the right place when
Floyd took him out for a round of golf during his visit.
</P>
<P>
   ''They did the simplest things, things that I liked,'' he said.
''That's why I'm here today.''

<HEADLINE> Todd Lyght OKs Deal With Rams  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MACOMB, Ill. (AP) -- Cornerback Todd Lyght agreed to accept the
St. Louis Rams' one-year tender offer as a transition player and
reported to camp Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Lyght, who refused to report to camp in hopes of getting a
long-term deal, agreed to the offer of $4.042 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams said a long-term deal was still possible for the
31-year-old Lyght, who was in the Pro Bowl for the first time last
season.
</P>
<P>
   ''We might continue talks,'' Rams president Jay Zygmunt said.
''But we just want to get him in here and go from there.''
</P>
<P>
   League rules stipulate that the Rams would not have a franchise
player designation available next year unless a longer-term deal
was negotiated after signing the one-year contract. The Rams did
agree that if Lyght plays out the season on the one-year deal, they
would not place either the franchise or transition tag on him after
the season.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's great that Todd is coming in,'' coach Mike Martz said.
''That was always my intention. He is important to the success of
our team.''
</P>
<P>
   Martz had met with former New York Giants cornerback Phillippi
Sparks Monday and Tuesday in the event that Lyght remained out of
camp. Martz also talked with Lyght on Tuesday night and reiterated
that the Sparks discussions were ''not being used as leverage with
Todd. I want him here.''
</P>
<P>
   With Lyght reporting, the Rams no longer have interest in
Sparks. Lyght had been the final holdout.
</P>
<P>
   ''Not many teams have two good cornerbacks,'' Martz said. ''And
we have three strong ones,'' referring to Dexter McCleon and Dre'
Bly.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have our leader back, the guy who ties it all together,''
McCleon said
</P>
<P>
   Lyght was expected to be on the practice field Thursday morning,
but was not expected to play in St. Louis' first exhibition game
against the Oakland Raiders on Saturday night.

<HEADLINE> Residents Get Single-Game Tickets  </HEADLINE>
By GREG BEACHAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- Less than six weeks before a referendum
on a sales tax in Brown County to help renovate Lambeau Field, the
Green Bay Packers gave county residents hope they might someday get
to enjoy the improvements the tax would fund.
</P>
<P>
   The Packers announced a plan Wednesday to distribute 40,000
tickets to non-season ticket-holders each season, beginning in
2003. Under the plan, 4,000 tickets for each of 10 games will be
awarded by lottery to eligible Brown County households.
</P>
<P>
   The plan ''may change some minds,'' Packers president Bob Harlan
said. ''What's more important is I honestly think we're doing what
we should be doing. I feel a strong obligation to the residents of
Brown County.''
</P>
<P>
   Built in 1957, Lambeau Field has been sold out for every Packers
game since 1960, and the team's waiting list for season tickets has
nearly 60,000 names on it.
</P>
<P>
   Approximately 80,000 households in Brown County would be
eligible for the single-game tickets. Packers fans living outside
the county won't be allowed to enter the lottery.
</P>
<P>
   The team hasn't made available single-game tickets in four
decades, but Harlan said the franchise's concern for the community
-- not a politically judicious sense of timing -- was behind
Wednesday's announcement. The referendum on the half percent sales
tax is Sept. 12.
</P>
<P>
   ''We wanted to find a way to reach out to the fans of this
community,'' Harlan said. ''It's important to show the fans what we
want to do for them right now, not years down the line.''
</P>
<P>
   Harlan announced the plan at the home of Kevin and Amy Gille,
two Packers fans who are neither season ticket-holders nor team
shareholders, yet still could see a game under the team's plan.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's important for every generation to be able to get
inside the stadium and see the Packers,'' Kevin Gille said. ''The
team is a big part of our community.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked if the announcement was timed to push the sales tax
toward passage, Harlan said the Packers were merely responding to
requests from citizens who wanted to know the team's plans for the
expanded seating that would be added to Lambeau if the $295 million
renovation plan is implemented.
</P>
<P>
   Harlan said the Packers have heard repeatedly from lawmakers,
taxpayers and fans who don't attend games that more fans should be
eligible to see games if public tax dollars are used to help
finance the stadium's expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Calls to Steven Donarski of Citizens for Sensible Taxation, a
leading opposition group to the Packers' plan, were not immediately
returned Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Any county resident who's at least 18 years old would register
once for the single-game tickets for an indefinite number of
upcoming seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The Packers will hold registrations for the tickets on the
Lambeau Field concourse on the weekends of Aug. 12-13 and Aug.
19-20 -- even though the tickets won't be available for three more
years.
</P>
<P>
   Packers ticket director Mark Wagner said the team will take
special steps to prevent residents from scalping the tickets,
including a special stamp on the tickets' faces.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't want this to be a moneymaker for anybody,'' Wagner
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Packers want to add 6,000 additional seats to the top of the
Lambeau Field bowl. Of those extra seats, 2,000 will be given to
people on the waiting list, while the remaining 4,000 will be used
for single-game seats.
</P>
<P>
   The tickets will be awarded throughout the stadium, not just on
the top rows of seating, Harlan said.
</P>
<P>
   ''For all the support our friends and neighbors have given us
for so many years, they deserve those tickets,'' Harlan said.

<HEADLINE> Italy Marks Bombing Anniversary  </HEADLINE>
By ELLEN KNICKMEYER
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME (AP) -- Fifty-thousand people marched Wednesday to
commemorate the 20th anniversary of one of post-war Europe's worst
massacres, a still-mysterious bombing that killed 85 at the Bologna
train station.
</P>
<P>
   The procession ended at the yellow-brick station in the city of
Bologna, where a minute of silence at 10:25 a.m. ended with the
piercing shriek of a train whistle.
</P>
<P>
   At that minute on Aug. 2, 1980, two explosives-packed suitcases
exploded in a second-class waiting room, tearing through trains and
a summer crowd of vacationing travelers.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is humiliating for me to admit that many times within the
state there has been connivance, there were mistruths and lies, and
we don't know what was at the bottom of it,'' Prime Minister
Giuliano Amato told the marchers.
</P>
<P>
   Turning to the victim's families, discernable by daisies in
their buttonholes, Amato said, ''You're right to still feel owed
something because in this case truth and justice are wanting.''
</P>
<P>
   The bombing came during Italy's ''Years of Lead,'' from 1969 to
the mid-1980s, when right- and left-wing terror killed hundreds.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors called the bombing a neo-Fascist attack bent on
undermining Italy's democracy. Speculation was that Bologna was
targeted as a stronghold of Italian Communism.
</P>
<P>
   Those convicted, but later acquitted on appeal, included the
grandmaster of the secret ''P-2'' Masonic Lodge, accused of nothing
less than plotting a right-wing coup with the aid of officials of
Italy's own secret service.
</P>
<P>
   The two right-wing extremists convicted of dropping off the
bombs repeated in TV and newspaper interviews this week their
denials of guilt.
</P>
<P>
   The man and woman are now on limited release from prison.
</P>
<P>
   The president of the association of families of the bombing's
victims used the anniversary to renew the group's appeal that a
state-secrets provision be lifted in cases of massacres.
</P>
<P>
   ''Silence prevails on those who ordered the bombing, on those
who inspired it politically, on those who used the massacre for
political ends and for power,'' Paolo Bolognesi said.
</P>
<P>
   Italian authorities classified the investigation of the bombing
as secret, restricting information on it, until arrest warrants
were announced fully five years after the attack.
</P>
<P>
   Unusually for Italy, the long blocks of marchers Wednesday
included no political banners -- a request of the families.
</P>
<P>
   The bombing injured another 200 people. Until the breakup of the
Balkans, it stood as a high water-mark of bloodshed in post-World
War II Europe.
</P>
<P>
   A plaque at the station lists the names of those who died.
Outside, a clock in the square still stands at 10:25 -- the minute
it stopped 20 years ago.

<HEADLINE> Lockhart, Letterman Talk Politics  </HEADLINE>
By DEB RIECHMANN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton gets along just fine with
the guy he beat in 1992 -- no joke, White House press secretary Joe
Lockhart assured David Letterman Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Is there any enmity between the two presidents? Letterman asked
Lockhart on CBS's ''The Late Show.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Well, the president did beat him in 1992,'' Lockhart observed
dryly. ''He had to move. He had to pack, move out. But other than
that, they're fine. They get along very well.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and former President Bush have feuded recently after
Clinton mocked Texas Gov. George W. Bush's credentials to be
president, saying ''My daddy was president. I owned a baseball
team. They like me down there.'' The senior Bush said if Clinton
continued to talk that way ''then I'm going to tell the nation what
I think about him as a human being and a person.''
</P>
<P>
   The younger Bush was an easy target for Clinton, Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the president went out and poked a little fun at
George W. Bush, which is not a hard thing to do,'' Lockhart said.
''His father, being a father, wanted to defend him and he did.''
</P>
<P>
   On another political note, Letterman asked Lockhart to help the
show arrange a debate between the younger Bush and Vice President
Al Gore. Gore has accepted the offer; Bush hasn't replied, which
has spawned repeated ribbing from Letterman.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart confessed that Clinton was a ''little nervous'' before
his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, who is running for a Senate seat
from New York, appeared on the Letterman show late last year.
</P>
<P>
   ''To make it in New York you've got to come and sit in this
chair and stand up and be able to walk out without assistance,''
Lockhart said.

<HEADLINE> Arabian Light Wins Graduation Stake  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEL MAR, Calif. (AP) -- Arabian Light made it two wins in as many
lifetime starts Wednesday, breezing to a five-length victory over
Stocks Are Rising in the $125,000 Graduation Stakes for 2-year-olds
at Del Mar.
</P>
<P>
   Ridden by David Flores and carrying 117 pounds, Arabian Light
covered 5&AMP;frac12; furlongs in 1:03 4-5 and, as the 3-5 favorite, paid
$3.20, $2.40 and $2.10.
</P>
<P>
   The win was worth $75,000, raising Arabian Light's career
earnings to $100,800. The son of Fly So Free won his only previous
start, at Hollywood Park in June.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks Are Rising, an 18-1 long shot ridden by Laffit Pincay
Jr., and carrying 114 pounds, crossed the finish line 1&AMP;frac12; lengths
ahead of Rocky's Crew and returned $6.60 and $2.60.
</P>
<P>
   Rocky's Crew, ridden by Alex Solis and carrying 117 pounds, was
a neck in front of Good Cop Bad Cop at the wire and paid $2.40 to
show. Solis rode four winners earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
   Shining Nuggets finished fifth and Cool Composure was sixth and
last in the 49th running of the race, contested previously at six
furlongs. Nonconnah Creek, Oh Really, Slew Has A Message and Tidal
Prince were scratched.

<HEADLINE> German Police Question Bomb Suspect  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUESSELDORF, Germany (AP) -- Police investigating a bomb attack
that injured 10 immigrants from the former Soviet Union said
Wednesday they were questioning a suspect in the case.
</P>
<P>
   State prosecutor Johannes Mocken said the suspect had not been
linked to the rightist scene in the past, but that recent
indications had hardened suspicions against him as a possible
suspect in the July 27 train station bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Mocken said the suspect, the owner of a sports and security
items business near where the bombing took place, did have a past
record of violations. He did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   But the prosecutor urged caution at jumping to conclusions,
saying ''of course we must follow up on this lead and all other
leads.''
</P>
<P>
   Mocken said that after questioning of the suspect and evaluation
of what was found in a search of buildings near the station, a
decision would be made on whether he should be arrested.
</P>
<P>
   A police spokeswoman declined to say whether the lead had
clarified if the bombing was motivated by anti-Semitism or
anti-foreigner sentiment. The fact that all the victims were
foreigners, and six of them Jewish, have raised fears that it was
carried out by far-right extremists.
</P>
<P>
   Police said they have been bombarded with new tips from the
public after the reward for information was raised to $60,000.

<HEADLINE> Administration Seeks Emission Cuts  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration is proposing that
carbon dioxide absorbed by forests and agricultural lands could
account for a substantial amount of the greenhouse gas reductions
required under a pending international treaty on global warming.
</P>
<P>
   Such credits could ease the burden on industry to cut emissions
of heat-trapping carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels.
They also could make the treaty more acceptable to the Senate,
which must ratify it.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department, in a report Wednesday to the United
Nations, calculated that about 310 million metric tons of carbon
dioxide are absorbed annually in U.S. forests and in soil used for
crops and livestock grazing.
</P>
<P>
   This carbon ''sink'' amounts to nearly half of the annual carbon
emission reductions the United States would be expected make
beginning in 2008 under the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials said Wednesday that in upcoming
negotiations on implementing the treaty, the United States will
argue that a significant portion of the 310 million tons should be
counted as credits toward emission reductions.
</P>
<P>
   The treaty is a priority for Vice President Al Gore, who helped
craft it. Many Republicans and the party's expected presidential
nominee, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, contend that the treaty is too
costly and burdensome on industry.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say it would mean sharply higher energy prices, while
many environmentalists maintain the goals can be met by improving
energy efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has not submitted the treaty to the Senate for
ratification, fearing it will be rejected. At the same time, the
administration has sought to find ways to make the treaty more
palatable.
</P>
<P>
   In submitting its findings on forests and soils to the United
Nations, the State Department made clear it intends to argue that
these ''sinks'' should be broadly taken into account.
</P>
<P>
   The treaty would require industrial countries to reduce man-made
heat-trapping gases -- mainly carbon dioxide -- to below 1990 levels.
For the United States that would mean a 7 percent reduction below
what they were a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   According to the State Department analysis, U.S. emissions
likely will be about 2.1 billion tons by 2008. The treaty would
require that to be cut to 1.5 billion tons between 2008 and 2012.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations later this year are intended to reach agreement on
how to achieve such reductions, including what credits countries
should get for carbon that is absorbed in trees and soil.
</P>
<P>
   David Sandalow, assistant secretary of state for environment,
said credits for the carbon sinks offered by forests and
agricultural land will be ''a top priority'' of U.S. negotiators in
talks with other industrial countries.
</P>
<P>
   Most European countries do not want to give sizable credits for
such sinks, in part because they have fewer forests and
agricultural lands than the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Sandalow said it has not been determined how much of the 310
million tons of carbon should be subject to credits. Roger
Ballentine, the White House's climate change director, said the
United States will seek ''a pretty significant number'' of tons.
</P>
<P>
   Many environmentalists have opposed heavy reliance on forest and
agricultural carbon sinks, contending that would mean less emphasis
on cutting greenhouse gases from industrial plants and other
sources.
</P>
<P>
   ''That effectively reduces genuine emission reductions,'' said
Daniel Lashoff, a climate scientist at the Natural Resources
Defense Council.
</P>
<P>
   David Oppenheimer, a climate scientist for Environmental
Defense, said the State Department analysis reflects activities
already under way and apart from the treaty's requirements.
</P>
<P>
   ''To give credit for things that would have happened anyway,
rather than new initiatives ... should be minimized,'' Oppenheimer
said.
</P>
<P>
   Some scientists also argue that not enough is known about the
environmental impact of heavy reliance on forest and agricultural
carbon sinks. For example, additional tree-growing might threaten
old-growth forests or ecologically fragile ecosystems.

<HEADLINE> K.D. Williams Tries To Fill LB Hole  </HEADLINE>
By GREG BEACHAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- Earlier in the week, K.D. Williams wasn't
sure why the Green Bay Packers wanted him. Now he knows.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a lot of opportunity here for a good linebacker,''
Williams said Wednesday after working out with the Packers, who
acquired him in a trade with New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a lot of good players here, but there's no definite
starters and reserves and guys who won't make the team. Everybody's
got a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   That's where the Packers currently stand with a linebacking
corps that could be among the NFL's weakest this season. Of last
year's three starters, only Bernardo Harris will play when Green
Bay opens its preseason schedule against the New York Jets on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Williams, the team's leading tackler last season before
tearing a knee ligament on Nov. 1, won't play until at least the
regular season opener on Sept. 3, and could be out much longer. The
third starter, George Koonce, was released in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   Taking their places are rookies, career backups and castoffs
from other teams. K.D. Williams, who impressed Green Bay as a
member of the Raiders in last year's regular season opener, is the
latest name added to the mix.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're putting a lot of guys in position to make this team as a
linebacker,'' coach Mike Sherman said. ''We're going to let them
decide on the field who wants to make the plays at that position.
It will be a process that lasts all the way up to the first game of
the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams wasn't sure he wanted to leave the Saints when they
traded him. After playing in the CFL, getting chances with four NFL
teams and spending a season in NFL Europe -- with a stint as a
skycap at the Tampa airport in between -- he thought he had a good
shot at making the Saints' roster.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now that (the trade) has happened, I feel good about it,''
Williams said. ''I think I can make an impact here.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris is enjoying a decent training camp, but none of the other
linebackers has been overly impressive. Sherman plans to give every
linebacker on the roster ample chance to impress him during the
four preseason games.
</P>
<P>
   ''It'll be decided on the field, that's all I can say,'' Sherman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Na'il Diggs has shown potential, particularly as a
run-stopper, but is still raw. Another rookie, Eugene McCaslin, has
caught the eyes of the coaches with his athleticism, but also has
much to learn.
</P>
<P>
   Jude Waddy -- who took over Brian Williams' starting spot last
season after the injury -- is still learning his expanded role in
the defense. Though he's considered undersized for an NFL
linebacker, he is also adjusting his physical game after gaining 10
pounds in the weight room during the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   ''I realize I need to step up in this defense, particularly with
Brian out,'' Waddy said. ''I'm trying to take a lot of
responsibility on myself to learn and to lead out there on the
field.''
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Harris played just nine games in the last two seasons
with the Dolphins because of injuries and inconsistency, yet he
entered training camp as the top candidate to take Koonce's
starting spot. He hasn't stood out so far in camp, but that may
change once the preseason schedule starts.
</P>
<P>
   ''I like to get in games, because that's where I shine,'' Harris
said. ''You can't tell everything about a player from practice. I
like to get in a game.''

<HEADLINE> Group Wants US to Halt Missile Plan  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Britain should push the United States to halt
plans for its national missile defense system, a parliament
committee on foreign affairs recommended Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The missile defense program is a $60 billion system that would
allow the United States to destroy incoming warheads.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the system argue that the program would increase
Britain's vulnerability to attack without offering coverage by the
U.S. defensive screen.
</P>
<P>
   The Foreign Affairs Committee into Weapons of Mass Destruction
recommended that the government urge the United States ''to seek
other ways of reducing the threats it perceives,'' rather than try
the missile shield.
</P>
<P>
   The bi-partisan committee in its report said it was not
convinced that the missile defense program ''represents an
appropriate response to the proliferation problems faced by the
international community.''
</P>
<P>
   It also questioned the program's feasibility, noting that two
out of three tests on the system didn't work.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmakers also warned that Russia and China opposed the
program, which could be ''dangerously destabilizing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon has set a target date of 2005 for having a national
missile defense ready for use.

Oil Slick Slows Progress to British Columbia Town
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHETWYND, British Columbia (AP) -- This northeastern British
Columbia resource town earned a brief reprieve Wednesday in its
fight to prepare for the onslaught of a massive oil spill on the
Pine River.
</P>
<P>
   Environment officials tracking the 21-kilometer-long slick now
estimate it won't reach Chetwynd until Thursday, 24 hours later
than first thought.
</P>
<P>
   Three booms were stretched across the river upstream from the
town to contain the million-litre spill from a ruptured pipeline,
but authorities say it's inevitable some oil will reach Chetwynd's
water intake pipe.
</P>
<P>
   The delay gives the town more precious time to fill up its
reservoir with untainted water.
</P>
<P>
   About 80 people, employees of the Pembina Pipeline Corp., were
working to contain and mop up the spill, said Alex Dabrowski, a
spokesman for the British Columbia Environment Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   Three booms were flung across the 10-metre-wide river at
different points and trucks with vacuum pumps were trying to skim
off the oil, so far with undetermined success, Dabrowski said.
</P>
<P>
   The river is the source of water for 4,000 residents of Chetwynd
and its outlying area.

Anti-Nuke Activists Demand Ottawa call Off Russian Airlift
</P>
<P>
   OTTAWA (AP) -- Anti-nuclear activists fearing a potential
radioactive disaster want a proposed Russia-to-Canada airlift of
weapons-grade plutonium to be scrapped.
</P>
<P>
   ''The government of Canada has a responsibility to consult the
public,'' said Gordon Edwards, spokesman for the Canadian Coalition
for Nuclear Responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   His group joined several other critics Wednesday to demand that
the shipment be stopped or delayed until there are independent
public hearings.
</P>
<P>
   They fear a crash and subsequent fire could release deadly
plutonium dust -- a concern one nuclear official laughed off.
</P>
<P>
   Canada is ''wrong-headed'' to support disarming nuclear weapons
in the United States and Russia by seeing how well plutonium can be
burned in nuclear reactors, said the activists.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's about propping up the nuclear industry'' at needless risk
to Canada, said Kristen Ostling, spokeswoman for the Campaign for
Nuclear Phaseout.
</P>
<P>
   Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd. (AECL) submitted a plan Friday to
fly plutonium-laden fuel made from surplus Russian warheads to a
Candu reactor at Chalk River, Ontario, near Ottawa.
</P>
<P>
   It would be used with an earlier shipment of U.S. plutonium in
reactor tests expected to take about three years.

Reform School Staffer Denied Parole
</P>
<P>
   EDMONTON, Alberta (AP) -- One of the dozens of victims sexually
abused by convicted pedophile Karl Toft was relieved and grateful
Wednesday after the National Parole Board denied Toft's request for
early release.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that's the best thing the government did so far for
Toft,'' said the victim, who identified himself as Mark McGinnis.
''He's not dead yet. So he's not safe.''
</P>
<P>
   McGinnis, who saw Toft for the first time in 16 years, had swore
at his former tormenter as he walked into the hearing room.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hey, Toftie! You should be in . . . jail,'' McGinnis said.
</P>
<P>
   Toft was a staff member at the Youth Training Centre in
Kingsclear, New Brunswick In 1992 he was sentenced to 13 years in
prison for 34 sex crimes, committed over three decades, against
boys in his care.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1999 he was sent to the Phoenix program for sex offenders
and confined to an Edmonton mental hospital. He was seeking release
into the community to begin the program's second stage.
</P>
<P>
   After an entire morning of detailed questions about Toft's
sexual patterns, the three-member board ruled that he didn't have
an adequate plan to battle his pedophiliac temptations.
</P>
<P>
   The board was particularly troubled by Toft's inability to
remember some of his more vicious assaults, said board member
Claire Carefoot.

Toronto To Send Garbage To Ontario Mine
</P>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- In a move that infuriated many, the largest city
in Canada decided Wednesday it wants to ship millions of tonnes of
trash by trainload to an abandoned mine in Ontario's north.
</P>
<P>
   After hours of debate in city council Tuesday and Wednesday and
an impassioned plea in support of the plan by Toronto Mayor Mel
Lastman, councillors voted to ship 1.3 million tonnes of garbage
annually to an abandoned open-pit mine near Kirkland Lake, Ontario,
a town of 10,000 residents.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the garbage will ever see its way to Ontario's north,
however, remained in question.
</P>
<P>
   Pierre Belanger, of the Against the Adams Mine Campaign, vowed
to step up the battle against the garbage plan.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are prepared for a long fight and we promise Mr. Lastman
will get a bad reputation as Canada's toxic bad boy,'' he said in a
reference to Lastman's Bad Boy furniture chain.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto Coun. Jack Layton, a vocal opponent of the 12-year-old
proposal, said he's hoping the opinions of councillors will change
by October when they ratify Wednesday's vote.

   GREELEY, Colo. (AP) -- Denver Broncos defensive tackle Trevor
Pryce will report to training camp Friday after a two-week holdout.
</P>
<P>
   Pryce, in the fourth year of a five-year $4.9 million contract,
was seeking a new deal because he is the lowest paid starter on
Denver's defensive line and only the eighth highest paid starter on
the defense.
</P>
<P>
   Pryce still has no new contract. But after a stalemate since
late last week, one of his agents said he is confident a long-term
deal can be reached.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Broncos showed good faith, and we're going to reciprocate
in good faith to see what happens,'' agent Peter Schaffer said.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the parties continue acting in good faith, we're optimistic
that a long-term contract can be worked out,'' Schaffer said. If
not, he said, Pryce will ''play out his contract and go
elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Team officials declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos last week rejected Pryce's reduced proposal of a $1
million bonus and a $400,000 base salary this season, making his
salary-cap number about $33,000 higher than it was scheduled to be
this year.
</P>
<P>
   The team also rejected Pryce's request that the Broncos not use
their franchise tag on him to restrict his negotiations with other
teams when his contract expires in two years.
</P>
<P>
   Broncos owner Pat Bowlen said the team's seven-year, $31.5
million offer, which included a $6 million signing bonus, was the
team's final offer.
</P>
<P>
   Pryce's contract will pay him $762,000 in base salary this
season. He played sparingly as a rookie in 1997, but blossomed into
an All-Pro last year.

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUBURN HILLS, Mich. (AP) -- Lisa Leslie scored 27 points and
Tamecka Dixon added 17 -- all in the second half -- as Los Angeles
beat the Detroit Shock 84-81 Wednesday night, the Sparks' 10th
straight victory.
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks (26-3) also won their 10 straight on the road,
breaking the league record they shared with the 1998 Houston
Comets.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit (12-16) lost its sixth in eight games since the All-Star
break. However, the Shock still lead Washington by one-half game
for the fourth and last Eastern Conference playoff position.
</P>
<P>
   Dominique Canty led Detroit with 17 points, and Astou
Ndiaye-Diatta had 15 points and 12 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   The Shock led for the entire first half, and held a 36-33 edge
at the intermission.
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks got back into the game when Ukari Figgs and Dixon hit
3-pointers on their first two possessions of the second half,
cutting the deficit to 38-37. Leslie's three-point play tied it at
48 with 14:12 to go.
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks stayed close, but Claudia Maria das Neves hit one of
her trademark NBA-length 3-pointers to give the Shock a 58-54
cushion with 10:29 to go.
</P>
<P>
   That started a 7-1 run that gave the Shock a seven-point lead
with 8:20 to go.
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks came back with a 7-2 surge of their own that included
five points from Dixon.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles took a 66-65 lead on Dixon's layup with 5:58 left,
and the teams traded the advantage for the next several minutes.
</P>
<P>
   After eleven lead changes, Mwadi Mabika and Figgs hit
consecutive 3-pointers to give the Sparks an 80-75 lead with 1:29
to go.
</P>
<P>
   On the ensuing possession, Leslie fouled out and Palmer hit two
free throws, but Clarissa Machanguana answered with a putback to
keep the margin at five.
</P>
<P>
   Canty's basket made it 82-79, and Dixon was called for an
offensive foul to give Detroit the ball with 31.4 seconds left.
Palmer scored to get Detroit within one, but Dixon made two free
throws to move the edge back to 84-81 with 12.6 to go.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer missed a 3-pointer, with the rebound bouncing harmlessly
out of bounds as time expired.

<HEADLINE> Downey Jr. Gets Out of Prison  </HEADLINE>
By LINDA DEUTSCH
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Actor Robert Downey Jr. was released from
prison on $5,000 bail Wednesday after an appeals court ruled he had
served enough time to fulfill his three-year sentence on drug
charges.
</P>
<P>
   A panel of the California Second District Court of Appeal said
Downey was entitled to receive credit for time he served in drug
rehabilitation facilities.
</P>
<P>
   ''When those additional time credits are added in, it is obvious
appellant has more than served his sentence,'' the court's opinion
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Martinez, a spokesman for the California Department of
Corrections, said Downey was released at midafternoon from a drug
treatment facility at Corcoran.
</P>
<P>
   Downey, 34, was jailed after he admitted during a probation
hearing that he was missing scheduled drug tests. Superior Court
Judge Lawrence Mira sentenced him Aug. 5, 1999, to three years in
prison for violating his probation.
</P>
<P>
   Downey's lawyers petitioned the appeals court a year into
Downey's sentence, saying that Mira failed to indicate whether the
felony sentence would run concurrently or consecutively with
misdemeanor counts that placed him in rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's served a year and he should have been out in February,''
attorney Ross Nabatoff told the court at a hearing last week.
''This is a sad tale.''
</P>
<P>
   Downey had already served 53 days in a drug rehab lockdown
center as part of a 15-month sentence for the misdemeanor
convictions of driving under the influence, carrying an unloaded
weapon in his car and being under the influence.
</P>
<P>
   The son of film director Robert Downey earned an Oscar
nomination for his work in the title role in ''Chaplin,'' the 1992
screen biography of the famed comedian. Other film credits include
''Less Than Zero,'' ''Natural Born Killers,'' ''One Night Stand,''
''Two Girls and a Guy'' and ''U.S. Marshals.''
</P>
<P>
   The actor's legal troubles date to June 1996 when he was stopped
for speeding on the Pacific Coast Highway and authorities found
cocaine, heroin and a pistol in his vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   A month later he was found passed out on a child's bed in a
neighbor's home. Three days later, he was arrested for leaving a
recovery center.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Rick Helling pitched 6 2-3 strong
innings to win his sixth straight decision as the Texas Rangers
defeated the Chicago White Sox 7-2 Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Helling (13-7) allowed two runs on four hits with five walks and
six strikeouts. Tim Crabtree completed the four-hitter with 2 1-3
innings for his first save.
</P>
<P>
   Rusty Greer ended one streak and Gabe Kapler continued another
for Texas, which earned a split in the two-game series.
</P>
<P>
   Greer, mired in an 0-for-12 slump before the game, broke a
scoreless tie with a third-inning single to right that scored Frank
Catalanotto from second. Kapler then doubled to the left-center
field gap, scoring Greer and extending his major league-leading
hitting streak to 16.
</P>
<P>
   Ricky Ledee added an RBI groundout and Bill Haselman had an RBI
single during the inning as Texas built a 4-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   White Sox rookie Jon Garland (2-3) took the loss, allowing four
runs and nine hits in six innings.
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox cut Texas' lead in half in the fourth inning when
Chris Singleton's two-out, two-run double to center scored Herbert
Perry and Carlos Lee. It was only the third hit off Helling.
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox threatened again in the fifth after a walk to Paul
Konerko loaded the bases with two outs. However, Helling struck out
Perry to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Texas added three runs in the seventh. Pinch-hitter Chad Curtis
singled home Rafael Palmeiro, who doubled. Haselman's double to
center put the Rangers ahead 6-2, and Mike Lamb's RBI single added
another run.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Curtis is 6-for-11 as a pinch-hitter this year. ... White
Sox DH Harold Baines, who celebrated his return to his old team
with an RBI on Tuesday night, did not play Wednesday. ... The
Rangers have eight players on the disabled list, the latest being
pitcher Darren Oliver, who went on the DL Tuesday. Seven, including
All-Star catcher Ivan Rodriguez, have season-ending injuries. ...
The Rangers said Wednesday that OF Jason McDonald was assigned from
Class A Charlotte to Triple-A Oklahoma, while RHP Clint Sodowsky
was promoted from Double-A Tulsa to Oklahoma.

<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBORO, Mass. (AP) -- Bobby Rhine scored one goal and set up a
second to give the Dallas Burn a 2-1 victory over the New England
Revolution Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   In the 21st minute, Revolution defender Mauricio Wright failed
to control a cross from Mark Santel. The ball went off Wright's
chest to the feet of Rhine, who drilled the ball in from about 10
yards. It was Rhine's first goal of the year.
</P>
<P>
   In the 67th minute, Rhine took a pass from Oscar Pareja and sent
a cross to the left side that a sliding Jason Kreis deflected into
the goal for his 11th tally of the year, giving the Burn (10-11-4)
a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution (9-10-5) pulled within one in the 87th minute.
Jamar Beasley stripped Jorge Rodriguez in midfield and Wolde Harris
gathered the loose ball and ran in alone to beat goalkeeper Matt
Jordan from 10 yards.
</P>
<P>
   The game featured a number of missed chances.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth minute, Revolution defender Joey Franchino headed
a shot by Chad Deering off the line.
</P>
<P>
   Only seconds before halftime, John Harkes passed to Jose Luis
Morales on the right side only to have the Spaniard be denied by
Jordan who deflected the 15-yard shot.

   TORONTO: RF Raul Mondesi went to Florida to seek a third opinion
on his ligament problems in his right elbow. Mondesi, who is on the
15-day disabled list because of the injury, traveled to Coral
Gables on Tuesday to seek the opinion of Dr. Jose Uriebe. Mondesi
was originally checked by Dr. Allan Gross in Toronto, and also by
Dr. Frank Jobe in Los Angeles. Jobe told him to rest the elbow
completely.
</P>

   OAKLAND: 2B Jose Ortiz figures to make his first big league
start against a left-handed pitcher when the A's travel to Chicago
for a weekend series. Ortiz was recalled on Tuesday after leading
the Pacific Coast League with 148 hits. ''I don't want him to think
this is something big,'' said A's manager Art Howe. ''We brought
him up to face left-handed pitchers.'' Ortiz says he's ready for
the challenge. ''I think I can help a little bit with my offense,''
he said. ... RHP Omar Olivares was scheduled to make his second
rehab start Wednesday at Class-A Modesto. He's slated to throw four
innings. ... Entering Wednesday's game, A's starters have gone at
least seven innings in each of the last seven games. That's the

   NEW YORK: RHP David Cone threw in the bullpen at the Yankees'
player development center in Tampa, Fla., and also reviewed a
videotape of the session with pitching guru Billy Connors. ''I
realize I need to work on other things,'' said Cone, ordered to
Florida last weekend by owner George Steinbrenner. ''You don't have
time to work like this in the major leagues.'' Cone, who is 1-10
and winless since April 28, could leave Friday to rejoin the
Yankees. ... Yankees manager Joe Torre wanted to find out the
status of Cone and Orlando Hernandez before deciding on his weekend
rotation. Hernandez, at Tampa on a rehab assignment, has been on
the disabled list since July 14 because of discomfort in his right
elbow and mild back spasms. ... New York's medical staff is

left side which he felt while running Tuesday. LHP Phil Norton will
make his ML debut Thursday against San Diego. ... Newly acquired LF
Rondell White was examined by Cubs team physicians Wednesday, but

time this season on June 5.
Astros-Marlins:

25-man roster.
</P>
<P>
   FLORIDA: The Marlins sent INF Mendy Lopez to Triple-A to make
room on the roster for newly acquired OF Henry Rodriguez, who
joined the club Wednesday. ... Tuesday was the first time in club
history that the Marlins lost a game in which they allowed two hits
or less. It also happened to be the club's second combined
two-hitter in less than a week, as Jesus Sanchez, Dan Miceli and
Antonio Alfonseca teamed up to beat Arizona last Saturday.
Reds-Mets:
</P>
<P>
   CINCINNATI: Reds pitching coach Don Gullett rejoined the team
Wednesday after chest pains Monday night forced him to be
hospitalized. He is expected to travel home with the Reds and see
his doctor in Cleveland on Thursday. ... The Reds faced left-handed
starters in all three games against the Mets. The Reds last saw
three straight lefties on Aug. 3-5, 1997. ... Elmer Dessens (5-1)
had his streak of four straight winning starts snapped. Dessens
joined the rotation when the Reds traded Denny Neagle to the New
York Yankees on July 12. Neagle was the last Reds pitcher to win
four straight starts when he won six consecutive last Aug. 30-Sept.
25. ... Cincinnati dropped two straight at Shea Stadium after
starting its six-game road trip 4-0.
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK: The Mets finished their homestand 8-1, sweeping three
games from Montreal and St. Louis and winning two of three from

Friday. ... Armando Benitez extended his career-high save total to
27 Wednesday. He has not permitted an earned run in his last 17 1-3
innings. ... The Mets bullpen is 2-0 with five saves and a 2.75 ERA
in the last 12 games. The starters are 7-2 with a 2.75 ERA in the
last 10 games. ... 2B Edgardo Alfonzo sat out with a bruised shin
but is expected to return to the lineup Friday. He was injured
Tuesday when Cincinnati's Alex Ochoa slid into him. ... 3B Robin
Ventura went 2-for-4 with a two-run homer in Wednesday's 2-1 win.
He batted third for the first time this season.
Dodgers-Pirates:
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES: The Dodgers played their final game of the season
on artificial turf Wednesday, finishing 8-5. ... RHP Jeff Shaw has
pitched nine scoreless innings since returning from the disabled
list. ... OF Tom Goodwin is 1-for-7 since rejoining the Dodgers,
but the leadoff hitter has walked four times. He reached base in
his first four plate appearances Wednesday, scoring twice. ...
Adrian Beltre hit .316 with 14 RBIs during the Dodgers' 6-4 road
trip. ... Gary Sheffield is 25-for-69 (.362) with eight doubles, a
triple, seven home runs and 17 RBIs since the All-Star break. ...
Dodgers RHP Matt Herges (8-0) leads all NL rookies in victories.
</P>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH: RHP Jason Schmidt, whose rehabilitation assignment
at Bradenton, Fla., was cut short by discomfort in his right
shoulder, will return to Birmingham, Ala., to be examined by
orthopedist James Andrews. Six weeks ago, Andrews determined
Schmidt had inflammation but no tear in his right rotator cuff.
Schmidt, the Pirates' opening day starter, hasn't pitched since
early June and, because of latest setback, may not pitch again this
season. ... The Pirates finished 6-6 on their longest homestand of
the season. They play 16 of their next 19 on the road through
August 23, returning home only to play Arizona on Aug. 11-13. ...
OF Adrian Brown (hamstring) is 2-for-9 in three games on a
rehabilitation assignment at Triple-A Nashville. ... Francisco
Cordova, who starts Thursday night in San Francisco, was 0-2 with a
10.80 ERA against the Giants last season and is 2-4 with a 6.08 ERA
against them in nine career appearances. ... 1B Kevin Young,
considered one of the NL's top defensive first basemen two years
ago, committed his 16th error Wednesday. He has 39 errors the last
two seasons; the last major league 1B with more than 40 errors in
consecutive seasons was the Pirates' Donn Clendenon, who had 52 in
1965 and 1966. Young blames knee surgery that he believes has cost
him a step and restricted his range and mobility.
Giants-Brewers:
</P>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO: Starter Joe Nathan, who has been on the disabled
list since July 14 due to right shoulder inflammation, was
scheduled to make a rehab start Wednesday night at Triple-A Fresno.
... Marvin Benard, who left the team following Sunday's game in
Chicago to attend the funeral of his sister-in-law, will rejoin the
team Thursday. ... San Francisco finished its season-long road
trip. The Giants visited Los Angeles, San Diego, Chicago and
Milwaukee and played a total of 12 games. ... Felix Rodriguez has
yielded just two earned runs in his last 14 outings, working 15
innings during the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE: The Brewers placed RHP David Weathers on the 15-day
disabled list with a strained oblique muscle in his left side.
Rafael Roque was recalled from Triple-A Indianapolis. The team also
purchased the contract of right-hander Everett Stull from
Indianapolis and designated pitcher Bob Scanlan for assignment. ...
The left side (shortstop and third base) of the Brewers infield has
not committed an error over the last 15 games. ... The Brewers
won't play again at home until Aug. 11. ... Charlie Hayes was
0-for-3 Wednesday and does not have a hit in his last 16 at-bats.
... Geoff Jenkins has homered in three of his last four games.
Braves-Diamondbacks:
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA: RF Brian Jordan was in the lineup for the second
consecutive night after missing four games with a twisted right
knee. He hit a two-run game-tying homer in the Braves' 4-2 victory
Tuesday night, then ended the game with a diving catch of Matt
Williams' pop foul in the ninth. ... RHP Andy Ashby narrowly missed
going against his old Philadelphia teammate Curt Schilling. While
Schilling started for Arizona Wednesday night, Ashby is Atlanta's
starter on Thursday. Ashby is 3-0 with a 0.78 ERA in three starts
since being traded to the Braves. ... Closer John Rocker has had
only one save since June 23. He was booed heartily by the
Diamondbacks' crowd when he was pulled by manager Bobby Cox in the
ninth inning Tuesday after walking two of the three batters he
faced.
</P>
<P>
   ARIZONA: LF Luis Gonzalez was still simmering over the fan who
knocked his glove out of the way and caught Brian Jordan's homer
Tuesday night. Gonzalez said he'd seen the replay over and over and
was convinced he had a good shot at catching the ball if the fan
hadn't gotten in the way. ''I didn't sleep last night I was so
ticked,'' Gonzalez said. ''If that happened in Boston with the Red
Sox fans, that guy would have needed a serious police escort out of
there.'' ... RHP Todd Stottlemyre has thrown for three days without
any pain in his shoulder. It's the first time he's thrown since he
went on the DL June 26 with tendinitis in the right elbow. The
Diamondbacks say he could be back by September, but he hopes it's
sooner.
Phillies-Padres:
</P>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA: Phillies RHP Paul Byrd underwent successful
arthroscopic surgery on his right shoulder, performed by Dr. Craig
Morgan. Byrd is expected to miss the rest of the season. ... RHP
Kent Bottenfield, acquired from Anaheim on Sunday, is scheduled his
make his first Philadelphia start on Friday at Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO: The Padres extended their working relationship with
the Mexicali Aguilas of the Mexican Pacific League for the third
consecutive year, covering the 2000-2001 winter season, San Diego
general manager Kevin Towers announced. The Padres' Mike Darr
previously played in Mexicali. ... The Padres went 1-0 in three
games against Omar Daal this season before he was traded from
Arizona to the Phillies.

<HEADLINE> Saunders Pitches 2 Innings at Rehab  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) -- Tampa Bay Devil Rays left-hander Tony
Saunders made a successful return to the mound Wednesday night,
pitching two scoreless innings in a minor league rehabilitation
assignment.
</P>
<P>
   Saunders, who fractured his pitching arm almost 14 months ago,
started for the Class A Charleston RiverDogs in a South Atlantic
League game against Augusta. He allowed one hit while walking one
and striking out two.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a huge step for me, I'm not going to lie about it,''
Saunders said. ''I've still got a long way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Saunders threw 27 pitches, 16 for strikes. His fastball was
consistently in the 84-85 mph range and topped out at 88 mph.
</P>
<P>
   ''I felt good,'' Saunders said. ''In the first inning, I was
more worried about putting the ball down the middle of the plate
rather than location, but in the second inning, I backed off
velocity-wise and went more for location.''
</P>
<P>
   The 26-year-old Saunders, who is hoping to return to the Devil
Rays when major league rosters expand on Sept. 1, broke his left
humerus -- the bone from shoulder to elbow -- while throwing a 3-2
pitch on May 26, 1999, in a game against the Texas Rangers at
Tropicana Field.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Foley, the Devil Rays' director of minor league operations,
said Saunders will make several more rehab starts before a decision
is made on a return to the majors.
</P>
<P>
   ''There were no expectations going into this,'' Foley said.
''The only thing was to get him into a game and let him pitch. He
threw the ball well. He let the ball go and he threw all his
pitches.''

<HEADLINE> 31 Arrested in Colombia Drug Bust  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- U.S. and Colombian agents on Wednesday
arrested 31 people alleged to be members of a narcotics ring
exporting cocaine and heroin to the United States and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   In pre-dawn raids of 40 homes in six different cities on
Colombia's Caribbean coast, agents from the U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration and 250 Colombian anti-narcotics officials also
found an undisclosed amount of cocaine and heroin, said Luis
Ernesto Gilibert, the director of Colombia's national police force.
</P>
<P>
   Among those arrested Wednesday was Libardo Parra, the suspected
leader of the Caribbean Cartel, the group targeted by the sting,
said Gilibert, who personally oversaw the operation.
</P>
<P>
   He said the cartel used small boats and planes to export
narcotics to the United States using routes in Mexico and to Europe
via Haiti, Jamaica and Aruba.
</P>
<P>
   The raids were one of the largest anti-narcotics operations in
Colombian history and the largest since the U.S. Congress approved
a $1.3 billion aid package in July to help Colombian authorities
battle narcotics traffickers and leftists rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Gilibert said more arrests could be coming later this week.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Pinch-hitter Henry Rodriguez doubled in his first
at-bat for Florida, setting up Luis Castillo's two-run single in
the bottom of the ninth inning that lifted the Marlins over the
Houston Astros 5-4 Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Berg singled off Marc Valdes (2-3) to start the ninth and
Rodriguez, acquired Monday from the Chicago Cubs, batted for Ramon
Castro and blooped a double.
</P>
<P>
   Jesus Sanchez pinch-ran for Rodriguez and Mike Lowell was hit by
a pitch, loading the bases with no outs. Castillo followed with a
single off Valdes' leg into center field.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Miceli (5-2) got the victory.
</P>
<P>
   Julio Lugo, starting in place of injured second baseman Craig
Biggio, had three hits for the Astros.
</P>
<P>
   Biggio tore ligaments in his left knee after getting tangled up
with Florida's Preston Wilson while taking a throw at second
Tuesday night. On Wednesday, Biggio was placed on the disabled list
for the first time in his 13-year career.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Bagwell and Lance Berkman hit consecutive home runs for
Houston. Bagwell led off the fourth with his 29th home run and
Berkman hit his 16th off Reid Cornelius. Moises Alou followed with
a double, but was stranded.
</P>
<P>
   Astros starter Wade Miller faded in the sixth with a 4-1 lead.
Wilson had an RBI grounder, and two walks loaded the bases with two
outs.
</P>
<P>
   Reliever Joe Slusarski walked Berg on four pitches, making it
4-3.
</P>
<P>
   Houston chased Cornelius in the sixth behind Tony Eusebio's
two-run double.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Fox homered in the Marlins fifth.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Astros have 12 players who weren't on their 25-man
roster on opening day. ... Houston RHP Jay Powell will begin a
rehab assignment in Round Rock on Thursday. ... Lugo started at
second base for the second time this year. He tied a career high
with three hits. ... Florida rookie RHP Brad Penny (sore shoulder)
is eligible to return from the 15-day DL Thursday. He will make at
least two rehab starts for Class A Brevard County. If all goes
well, he could make an Aug. 15 start against the Dodgers. ...
Cornelius was called for his third balk in his last three starts.
He hadn't been charged with a balk since 1995 until getting called
for two against Montreal on July 22.

Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Natalie Williams, averaging a league-leading 12.3 rebounds per

<HEADLINE> Minikus Leads in Equestrian Trials  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO, Calif. (AP) -- Todd Minikus, riding Oh Star,
was the only rider to leave all 16 jumps standing Wednesday and
moved into first place in the U.S. Equestrian Team Olympic show
jumping trials.
</P>
<P>
   Minikus, of Loxahatchee, Fla., moved past Laura Kraut, of
Oconomowac, Wis., who held a 3.75-penalty lead after the first set
of trials in June.
</P>
<P>
   Her mount, Liberty, dropped two rails on the impressive course
at the Oaks/Blenheim Rancho Mission Viejo Riding Park.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm obviously disappointed,'' said Kraut, the 1992 Olympic
alternate. ''Both of us were a little rusty.''
</P>
<P>
   Minikus now has an 0.5-penalty lead after being the only one the
11 competitors to have a trip.
</P>
<P>
   The best American finisher at the April World Cup finals, where
he tied for sixth, Minikus, 38, is one of the favorites to make the
four-person U.S. Equestrian Team that will compete in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   He was tied for fifth after the first set of trials with Alison
Firestone, who was No. 1 in the U.S. Equestrian Team's computer
rankings.
</P>
<P>
   Firestone, however, withdrew last month after her mount, Jox,
developed an abscess that could not be cleared up in time for the
trials, which continue Friday and Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Margie Goldstein-Engle, 42, of Wellington, Fla., and Nona
Garson, 40, of Tewksbury, N.J., held on to third and fourth place
by scoring just one knockdown each. With only 4.5 penalties
separating the top six, the makeup of the team is still very much
up in the air.
</P>
<P>
   ''Anything could happen, certainly,'' Garson said. ''We've got a
great group here.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL (AP) -- Will Clark hit a home run in his first start for
St. Louis and Jim Edmonds homered twice and drove in five runs as
the Cardinals beat the Montreal Expos 10-7 Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Clark, acquired from Baltimore on Monday's to play first base in
Mark McGwire's absence, went 3-for-4. He drove in two runs.
</P>
<P>
   Clark, who doubled in his first Cardinals at-bat Tuesday night,
hit his first NL home run in seven years leading off the second
inning. He reached safely in each of his first five plate
appearances for St. Louis before popping up in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   The NL Central-leading Cardinals are 9-14 since McGwire --
currently on the 15-day disabled list with right knee tendinitis --
has been out of the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonds, who returned to the lineup after missing two games
because of a sore right hip, matched his career high for RBIs in a
game.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonds hit a three-run homer in the third off Mike Johnson
(5-6). He hit his 32nd homer -- a two-run shot -- in the fifth for
his 11th career two-homer game, and third this season.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Hentgen (10-8) gave up five hits, including Geoff Blum's
solo homer in the seventh, in seven innings. He reached 10 wins for
the eighth straight season.
</P>
<P>
   Montreal's Lee Stevens hit a three-run homer in the eighth off
left-hander Jason Christiansen, who was making his Cardinals debut.
</P>
<P>
   Hentgen allowed just one hit through the first four innings
before the Expos, trailing 7-1, loaded the bases with two outs in
the fifth. Jose Vidro followed with a drive that right fielder J.D.
Drew ran down, making a diving catch to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Drew drove in the Cardinals' 10th run with an RBI single in the
eighth. Stevens hit his 20th homer in the bottom half.
Notes: Hentgen tied Boston's Pedro Martinez and Baltimore's Mike
Mussina, who also have eight consecutive seasons of at least 10
wins. Atlanta's Greg Maddux is tops among active pitchers with 13
straight seasons, followed by teammate Tom Glavine (12). ...
Edmonds had his third career five-RBI game. ... Cardinals OF Ray
Lankford did not play. He bruised his right knee while making a
diving catch Tuesday night. ... The Expos are 17-33 since June 5,
when they were a season-high eight games over .500 for the second
time this season.

the Chicago Fire over the Tampa Bay Mutiny 1-0 Wednesday night,
putting his team into a first-place tie with the Mutiny in the MLS
Central Division.
</P>
<P>
   Razov's penalty shot got past goalkeeper Scott Garlick in the
67th minute after Joe Addo was called for tripping Josh Wolff. The
Mutiny protested the penalty and a replay showed that Wolff was
tripped nearly a foot outside the penalty area.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay's (12-10-2) best scoring opportunity came in the 82nd
minute when Manuel Bucuane broke free from defenders. His shot from
10 yards out got past goalkeeper Zach Thornton, but hit the left
post.
</P>
<P>
   Thornton made six saves, including three leaping stops high in
the air and a diving stop on another.
</P>

<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A.J. Wood re-directed a shot by Richie
Williams past New York/New Jersey goalie Mike Ammann in the 99th
minute Wednesday night to give D.C. United a 3-2 overtime victory
over the MetroStars, ending their nine-game unbeaten streak.
</P>
<P>
   Williams sent a shot towards the goal from outside the box, and
Wood barely touched it. But it was just enough to re-direct it past
the sliding Ammann in the ninth minute of the 10-minute overtime
period.
</P>
<P>
   The win kept playoff hopes alive for United (6-13-6, 24 points).
It was the first loss for the MetroStars (13-8-2) since June 9.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Walsh headed in a cross from Steve Shak in the 87th minute
for the MetroStars to force overtime. United had taken a 2-1 lead
on Jaime Moreno's goal in the 68th minute.
</P>
<P>
   The MetroStars had only two shots on goal in regulation, but
scored on both.
</P>
<P>
   The start of the game was delayed 33 minutes when D.C. United
had to change jerseys because referee Marcel Yonan said the teams
were wearing shirts that were too similar.
</P>
<P>
   The MetroStars had to play without two of their top defenders,
Mike Pelke (red card) and Ramiro Corrales (yellow card
accumulation).
</P>
<P>
   Raul Diaz Arce gave United a 1-0 lead when he scored on a
breakaway in the sixth minute.
</P>
<P>
   United had three breakaways in the first 11 minutes but just
scored once as Ammann, who had eight saves, made several
spectacular stops. Simpson had only two saves, both in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Adolfo Valencia tied it in the 33rd minute, scoring on a penalty
kick after D.C. United's Jeff Agoos pulled down Petter Villegas in
the box.

<HEADLINE> Ecuador Indians Seek Congress End  </HEADLINE>
By GONZALO SOLANO
<TEXT>
<P>
   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- About 1,500 Indians, students and labor
unionists marched in Quito Wednesday, demanding a referendum that
could lead to the dissolution of Congress and halt the switch to a
U.S.-dollar economy.
</P>
<P>
   Led by Antonio Vargas, head of the powerful Confederation of
Indigenous Nations of Ecuador, the banner-waving demonstrators
delivered petitions that organizers said contained some 1.5 million
signatures.
</P>
<P>
   Under Ecuadorean law, a minimum of 600,000 signatures are
required for any group of citizens to request a referendum.
</P>
<P>
   Vargas warned that if authorities are ''intelligent, they should
accept a popular consultation.''
</P>
<P>
   Vargas' Indian movement has been at odds with President Gustavo
Noboa's government for months. In January, Vargas led an Indian
uprising with military backing that prompted the ouster of Noboa's
predecessor, President Jamil Mahuad.
</P>
<P>
   The economy has shown signs of turning around under Noboa, whose
approval ratings remain steady at around 40 percent. And
demonstration called by Indians and leftist-led labor federations
in recent months have been marked by low turnout.
</P>
<P>
   Noboa has largely carried on with Mahuad's economic programs,
including a plan to phase out the local currency, the sucre, and
replace it with the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
   The government hopes the currency changeover will stabilize the
economy, promote business investment and end inflation topping 100
percent a year, the highest in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   The government plans to completely eliminate the sucre by
September.
</P>
<P>
   Critics argue the dollar plan will hurt the poor by causing
prices to rise to international levels. Currently many basic food
products and services are subsidized.

<HEADLINE> Canada Mulls Seizing US-Owned Ship  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) -- Canada was considering boarding a
U.S.-owned cargo ship that is off its Atlantic coast and refuses to
deliver its cargo of Canadian military supplies because of a
contract dispute.
</P>
<P>
   A Foreign Affairs Department spokesman said Wednesday the
government had received permission to board the boat from St.
Vincent and the Grenadines, the Caribbean nation where the boat is
registered.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is one of the options,'' Reynald Doiron said.
</P>
<P>
   If boarded, Canadian authorities would presumably take control
of the vessel. Doiron refused to say if the ship would be forced to
head to a Canadian port.
</P>
<P>
   The GTS Katie, a 750-foot freighter, is 140 miles off
Newfoundland in international waters, holding onto a cargo that
includes Canadian military's armored vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Its owner, Annapolis, Md.-based Third Ocean Marine Navigation
Company, has refused to deliver the cargo, demanding payment it
says it is owed.
</P>
<P>
   Third Ocean was hired by a Montreal-based company, Andromeda,
which had in turn been contracted by the military to bring back the
military supplied used by Canadian peacekeepers in Kosovo, a
province of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Two Canadian warships were monitoring the Katie, which has been
off the coast since Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Margan, head of Third Ocean, who says Andromeda owes him
$288,000, said that late Wednesday the military had given him an
ultimatum to accept an offer of $90,000 or face being boarded.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've been told if we do not accept the $90,000 offer they
would board us. We've told the ship's manager not to resist,''
Margan said.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Affairs spokesman Ian Trites, asked about the claim of
an ultimatum, said, ''We are in negotiations, but all options are
open.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, spokesman Philip Reeker said the State Department
urged the Canadian government and the ship owners to continue
negotiating.
</P>
<P>
   The freighter is carrying five tanks, 200 of Canada's 2,000
armored vehicles, and 390 crates packed with rifles, ammunition,
and communications equipment. Three Canadian soldiers are also on
board to guard the cargo.
</P>
<P>
   The Katie had been scheduled to transport the shipment from
Thessaloniki, Greece, to a port near Montreal by mid-July. But the
ship was delayed reaching Greece, increasing costs of the voyage.
</P>
<P>
   Canada routinely charters foreign transport for its military
equipment overseas. The Navy has no transports equipped to carry
heavy armor and the Air Force's C-130 Hercules transports are
limited to about 20 ton of cargo.

<HEADLINE> Helicopters Used in Western Fires  </HEADLINE>
By HANNAH WOLFSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAVA HOT SPRINGS, Idaho (AP) -- Helicopters replaced ground
workers and bulldozers Wednesday as firefighters intensified
efforts to contain Idaho fires that were among nearly 50 raging
across 10 Western states.
</P>
<P>
   Helicopters capable of dumping 1,000 gallons of water were used
on 11 fires burning nearly 200,000 acres in the steep rugged
terrain of southeastern Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   ''Conditions are so dry that it just keeps jumping all those
lines,'' said Sky Huffaker, spokeswoman for the Eastern Idaho
Interagency Fire Center.
</P>
<P>
   The cluster of fires was only 20 percent contained, but crews
managed to stop flames that had threatened houses near the resort
community of Lava Hot Springs.
</P>
<P>
   Four dozen fires covering more than 700,000 acres burned in
Western states, injuring firefighters, forcing hundreds of
evacuations and creating a haze that shrouded mountains and deserts
and triggered respiratory warnings.
</P>
<P>
   Four firefighters suffered second-degree burns Wednesday as the
wind suddenly shifted while they battled one of several big blazes
that have blackened some 83,000 acres of California timber and
brush. Two firefighters were hospitalized in serious condition and
two were in fair condition.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, California firefighters made big gains against a
giant fire burning atop the southern Sierra Nevada, and a major
forest fire on the central coast was surrounded, allowing crews to
move elsewhere.

<P>
   California's biggest blaze, which had burned 72,200 acres in
Sequoia National Forest on the east side of the Southern Sierra,
was 40 percent contained.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government is spending $15 million a day to support
20,000 civilian and military firefighters from 46 states and
Canada. Undersecretary of Agriculture James Lyons said the
government is prepared to ask for help from foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
   ''Firefighting resources are stretched thin,'' Lyons said. ''We
may be requesting resources from other countries.''
</P>
<P>
   He said both Mexico and Australia have already been alerted that
they could be asked for assistance.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not something that's going to be over next week,''
said Forest Service Chief Mike Dombeck, who was meeting with fire
strategists at the National Interagency Fire Center in Boise on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasters say the kind of break in the weather needed to
change the conditions may not occur until October in the West.
</P>
<P>
   In Montana, 11 large fires had blackened at least 131,700 acres
as of Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   At least 50 people remained out of their homes Wednesday in the
Hamilton area of the Bitterroot Valley. They were evacuated after a
fire blew up Tuesday four miles west of Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   Some 200 residents and campers had been forced to evacuate
because of a fire 15 miles east of Jackson, Wyo. The fire was
started by lightning last week and more than doubled in size
overnight to 1,800 acres.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was quite a horrific sight to see the flames leaping all
over the place,'' said Barbara Hetherington, who evacuated her
family's cabin with her two grandsons.
</P>
<P>
   A fire sparked by lightning burned 4,000 acres and forced
evacuations in southwest Reno, Nevada, but firefighters said
Wednesday that improving weather overnight let them contain 65
percent of the blaze.
</P>
<P>
   Across the West, skies resembled the smog layer in a major
metropolis, causing residents to sneeze and snuffle and rub bleary,
red eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been getting up extra early just to watch the sunrise,''
said Tom Schlatter, a meteorologist at the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration. ''It's this big red globe coming up
every morning.''

<P>
   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Robert A. Brooks, a Midwestern
telecommunications entrepreneur who started several high-tech
companies, died Tuesday of complications after surgery. He was 69.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks was founder or co-founder of five companies, including
Cencom Cable Associates and Brooks Fiber Properties, two companies
that he sold in the 1990s. Cencom was a predecessor to cable TV
giant Charter Communications Inc., now owned by Microsoft Corp.
co-founder Paul Allen.
</P>
<P>
   He sold Cencom to Hallmark Inc. for $1 billion in 1991, and sold
Brooks Fiber to Worldcom for $3 billion in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks also founded Gabriel Communications Inc., a
telecommunications company that recently merged with TriVergent
Communications Inc.; OneComm Communications, one of the companies
that merged to form Nextel, a national wireless company; and Brooks
International Inc., which is developing telecommunications
facilities in Asia.

<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Frank S. Farrell, ''the strategic brain''
behind a lawsuit that led to a landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision
on legislative redistricting in a Tennessee case, died Monday of
congestive heart failure. He was 79.
</P>
<P>
   After losing a bid for the state Senate in 1956, Farrell filed a
federal lawsuit. He argued that the Legislature's failure to
reapportion since 1913 had resulted in gross disparities between
districts to the disadvantage of growing districts in the
metropolitan area.
</P>
<P>
   The courts ordered the Legislature to redistrict and his
argument later was the basis of a Tennessee case, Baker vs. Carr,
that became the Supreme Court's ''one man, one vote'' decision in
1962.
</P>
<P>
   The court ruled that legislative districts within a state must
be substantially equal in population.
</P>
<P>
   Farrell did not argue the case before the Supreme Court, but
historians as well as the attorneys credit him with shaping the
argument.
Solomon Halberstam:
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Grand Rabbi Solomon Halberstam, who led the
Bobov sect of Orthodox Hasidic Jews out of Europe after World War
II and oversaw its rebirth in gaining tens of thousands of
followers, died Wednesday. He was 92.
</P>
<P>
   Halberstam, a descendant of one of the first Hasidic leaders in
Europe, survived the purge of Jews by the Nazis, along with his
son. However, the rest of his family was killed.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1960s, he moved with just a handful of followers
from Europe to New York.
</P>
<P>
   The Bobovs are among about 60 Hasidic sects. The largest and
most well-known are the Satmars, who originated in Hungary, and the
Lubavitchers, from Russia.
William C. Harrison:
</P>
<P>
   BELLA VISTA, Ark. (AP) -- William C. Harrison, a former
Associated Press newsman and the news cooperative's western science
editor based in San Francisco, died Wednesday. He was 81.
</P>
<P>
   He was managing editor of a newspaper in Hampton, Iowa, before
joining the AP in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Harrison spent a year at Columbia University as a
Sloan-Rockefeller Advanced Writing Fellow. He wrote two children's
books.
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, Harrison joined the journalism faculty at Texas A&AMP;M.
</P>
<P>
   Harrison is survived by three sisters, two brothers, nieces, and
nephews.
Robert Sherwood Jackson:
</P>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- Robert Sherwood Jackson, chairman of
the board and former chief executive of Bombay Co., a Fort
Worth-based home furnishings company, died Tuesday of a heart
attack. He was 54.
</P>
<P>
   The Bombay Co. operates more than 400 home furnishing stores in
the United States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Before joining Bombay, Jackson was a private investor and
business consultant.
Don Weis:
</P>
<P>
   SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) -- Don Weis, a prolific director of films and
television shows for four decades, has died. He was 78.
</P>
<P>
   Weis directed more than 40 episodes of the television series
''MASH.''
</P>
<P>
   His list of TV directing credits also includes episodes for such
shows as ''The Twilight Zone,'' ''Alfred Hitchcock Presents,''
''Perry Mason,'' ''Ironside,'' ''Batman,'' ''Mannix,''
''Loveboat,'' ''Fantasy Island,'' ''Burke's Law,'' ''Suspense,''
''Remington Steele'' and ''Four Star Theatre.''
</P>
<P>
   Weis received six awards from the Directors Guild of America for
best director of the year in TV.
</P>
<P>
   His big screen credits include ''Just This Once,'' ''Banner
Line,'' ''I Love Melvin,'' ''You For Me,'' ''The Affairs of Dobie

<HEADLINE> Swimmer's Exclusion Claim Is Heard  </HEADLINE>
By SCOTT STODDARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- An international board of arbitrators met Thursday
to hear the final arguments in a suit by Suzu Chiba, one of Japan's
top swimmers, who claims she was unfairly left off her country's
team for the Sydney Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   The suit is the first of its kind raised by a Japanese athlete,
and has focused intense scrutiny on the often opaque selection
process used to decide who represents Japan at Olympic
competitions.
</P>
<P>
   Chiba is a two-time Olympian, winner of Japan's 200-meter
freestyle swimming championship and holder of the world's
second-fastest time in the 100-meter freestyle last year.
</P>
<P>
   She was left off the Olympic roster, however, because swimming
officials claimed she was not up to world-class competition. Chiba
then sued the Japan Amateur Swimming Federation.
</P>
<P>
   The Swiss-based Court of Arbitration for Sports began hearing
testimony from her and sports officials in Tokyo on Thursday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   Questions have been raised about other Olympic team choices as
well.
</P>
<P>
   Harumi Hiroyama was left off the marathon team for Sydney, even
though she had a better time than one of the athletes selected.
Hiroyama qualified instead for the 10,000 meters.
</P>
<P>
   Chiba would seem to have a strong case.
</P>
<P>
   In Atlanta, Chiba finished 10th in the 200 freestyle and was
13th in the 400, behind compatriot Eri Yamanoi, who was seventh.
</P>
<P>
   After the Atlanta Games she restarted her career under Bud
McAllister, who coached gold medalist Janet Evans of the United
States. Her time of 54.99 seconds in the 100 freestyle last year
was the second-best in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Then she won the 200 freestyle at Japan's national championships
in April -- a key event in selecting members for the Olympic team.
Her time of 2 minutes, 0.54 seconds was better than the Olympic
qualifying standard of 2:01.02.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese women broke 22 national records and one world record --
the first time Japan has set a world record in 28 years -- at the
April meet.

<HEADLINE> GOP Convention Nominates Bush  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID ESPO
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Republicans awarded Texas Gov. George W.
Bush their 2000 presidential nomination Wednesday night and chanted
in unison as running mate Dick Cheney ignited the convention with a
partisan spark, taunting the Democrats: ''It's time for them to
go.''
</P>
<P>
   Accepting his vice presidential nomination, Cheney said Al Gore
is ''trying to separate himself from Bill Clinton's shadow, but it
won't work.
</P>
<P>
   ''Somehow we will never see one without thinking of the other,''
he said in a speech that drew waves of applause from Republicans
locked out of the White House for eight years.
</P>
<P>
   Bush watched from his hotel suite a few miles away as his
nomination -- won in the hard primary battles of winter -- was sealed
by acclamation on a warm summer night. He called the convention
vote ''the stamp,'' on his campaign, ''the formal moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Describing himself as a ''tough competitor,'' the Texas
governor, son of a president and self-described ''compassionate
conservative,'' asserted: ''I'm going to give it my best shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside the convention hall at the First Union Arena, 2,066
delegates erupted as Bush's nomination was announced, cheering and
waving placards that bore the name of their ticket. Confetti
streamed from the ceiling; beach balls bobbed across a packed
floor.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney pledged immediate change in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ''On the first hour of the first day ... he will restore decency
and integrity to the Oval Office,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A former congressman and Defense Secretary, Cheney was the main
speaker on an evening that marked his return to politics after
eight years in private life, most recently as CEO of the oil
industry firm, Halliburton Co.
</P>
<P>
   The evening session beganon a somber note. Former football
quarterback Steve Young, delivering the invocation, asked a special
blessing for the recovery of former President Gerald R. Ford,
hospitalized a few miles away after suffering two small strokes.
His doctor said the 87-year-old Ford, honored at Tuesday night's
convention session, appeared to suffer no brain damage or permanent
disability and that chances for a full recovery were good.
</P>
<P>
   Delegates also heard from The Rock of the World Wrestling
Federation. In what passed for controversy at a harmonious party
gathering, some conservatives felt he was too violent a figure to
appear on the GOP program. But his message was conventional enough
-- an appeal to his fans to register to vote.
</P>
<P>
   Before Wednesday, Republican speakers had barely tagged Gore in
convention sessions designed to appeal to swing voters. But that
all ended quickly when Cheney strode to the podium to deliver his
debut speech as Bush's running mate.
</P>
<P>
   Moving quickly to the point, he said the Clinton-Gore era was
one of ''opportunities squandered,'' and noted that Clinton had
vowed to hold power until the last moment. ''That is his right,''
he said. ''But my friends, that last hour is coming. That last day
is near,'' he added to thunderous applause.
</P>
<P>
   ''The wheel has turned,'' said Cheney. ''And it is time... It is
time for them to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Three times he said it was ''time for them to go,'' and GOP
partisans took up the chant, jerking their thumbs in the air.
</P>
<P>
   The barb was an echo of Al Gore's vice presidential speech
before the Democratic convention in 1992, aimed then at President
George Bush, father of the Texas governor.
</P>
<P>
   When Wyoming cast the vote that put Gov. Bush over the top,
friends and family watching TV with the nominee burst into
applause. He flashed a smile of satisfaction, then kissed his wife
Laura on the cheek. She grabbed his right hand with both of her
hands and squeezed.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a huge honor ... a major step toward becoming the
president of the United States,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney lauded Bush in words that implicitly criticized Clinton.
Bush, he said, ''is a man without pretense and cynicism. A man of
principle, a man of honor.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney's nomination preceded Bush's by about an hour in a
convention schedule that mostly ran like clockwork. A few states
dawdled before casting their votes, and were promptly prodded to
hurry up.
</P>
<P>
   The political hoopla capped a day in which Bush flew into the
convention city aboard a campaign plane repainted red white and
blue. He campaigned energetically in English and Spanish, and
assured supporters, ''Together we can win in November.''
</P>
<P>
   Two days of relentlessly upbeat convention oratory aimed at
voters in the middle of the political spectrum were apparently
paying off for Bush. Polling by Voter.com-Battleground showed
support for the GOP ticket rising from 8 points over the weekend to
13 points through Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential candidates usually get a ''bounce'' from their
convention, and Gore will have a chance to reverse the GOP trend
when he announces his choice for running mate Aug. 8 and opens his
convention Aug. 14 in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the two-term governor of Texas who campaigned as
''compassionate conservative,'' stood as leader of a party that was
as unified as at any time since Ronald Reagan's re-election
campaign in 1984.

<HEADLINE> Actors Begin To Fast in Ad Strike  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Five actors have started a fast to publicize
their cause in the 14-week-old strike against the advertising
industry.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not about martyrdom or starvation, it's about
education and inspiration for all members of the union,'' said
James Arone, a member of the Screen Actors Guild.
</P>
<P>
   Arone and four other union members will not eat solid foods
during the fast, although other union members may replace them in
the protest. The fast will continue until a contract agreement is
reached, union officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ''They see no other way to resolve this,'' strike coordinator
Michael Brennan said on behalf of the SAG and the American
Federation of Television and Radio Artists.
</P>
<P>
   A call to advertising industry representatives was not
immediately returned Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The strike already is the longest commercial actors strike in
union history, and an effort to restart talks last month was
unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   Actors want to be paid residuals for ads on cable television, as
they are now paid for network spots, and also want jurisdiction
over commercials shot for the Internet. Advertisers are seeking to
pay actors a flat fee for all commercials.
</P>
<P>
   The strike has cost the Los Angeles County economy $70 million
in lost wages and support services, according to county economic
experts.
