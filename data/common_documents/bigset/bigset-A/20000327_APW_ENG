<HEADLINE> Vignettes From 72nd Academy Awards  </HEADLINE>
By ANTHONY BREZNICAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Oscar bandits weren't about to get a second chance.
</P>
<P>
   The dozens of Academy Awards statuettes that junkman Willie
Fulgear rescued from the trash last week arrived at Sunday night's
awards ceremony in a van surrounded by armed guards.
</P>
<P>
   ''We weren't going to risk anything at this point,'' said Ric
Robertson, the Academy's executive administrator. He was vague
about just how many extra guards he employed.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's Oscars were a mixture of the ones that were stolen and
then recovered, and replacements that were quickly ordered after
the first batch disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't clear which winners would be going home with the ones
Fulgear pulled from the trash.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   Following the lead of Jennifer Lopez, one of the ''South Park''
guys decided to let it almost all hang out.
</P>
<P>
   Trey Parker, co-nominated for best original song with composer
Marc Shaiman for ''Blame Canada,'' arrived at the Oscars wearing a
green tropical-print, low-cut outfit that was the spitting image of
the one Lopez stunned spectators with at last month's Grammy
awards.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was just blessed with a beautiful body and it hangs
perfectly. ... I don't use tape,'' Parker said when asked the same
thing everyone wondered of Lopez: How do you keep it in place?
</P>
<P>
   As he spoke, he ran his hand from the top of his hairy chest to
his navel, where the dress came together before opening again to
reveal a pair of hairy legs.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The director of ''The Sixth Sense'' says he may have had a
paranormal experience on the eve of the Oscars.
</P>
<P>
   M. Night Shyamalan said he found a miniature Oscar statuette
inside a church while scouting locations for his next film,
''Unbreakable.''
</P>
<P>
   ''One of the crew members just found it at my feet,'' he said,
holding up the miniature as he walked down the red carpet to the
Shrine Auditorium for Sunday's Oscars.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's a sign from God. Either a concession prize or an
omen, a sign of things to come,'' said Shyamalan, nominated for
best director for the film about a boy who sees dead people.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   For Michael Clarke Duncan and Lucy Liu, the roar of adulation
only made them want more.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan, the towering actor nominated for his supporting role in
''The Green Mile,'' thundered up and down the red carpet, waving at
fans and urging them to cheer even louder as his fellow celebrities
paraded into the Shrine Auditorium.
</P>
<P>
   ''It just wasn't enough for me, you've got to work the audience
here,'' said the former ditch digger from Chicago, who grinned and
cheered along with the spectators.
</P>
<P>
   Liu had a section of her fans cheering and screaming as she
approached two young blond men wearing T-shirts reading ''I Love
Lucy.''
</P>
<P>
   The ''Ally McBeal'' co-star allowed each one to kiss her hand
before moving on.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   Tom Cruise, nominated as best supporting actor for ''Magnolia,''
says he was always a fan of the movies but not always of the
Oscars.
</P>
<P>
   ''We watched a lot of movies, but I actually never saw the
Oscars until I became an actor,'' he said, reminiscing briefly as
he headed into the Academy Awards for Sunday night's ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   ''Then I started watching them for some reason,'' he quipped.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   It wouldn't be a big-deal Hollywood event without at least a
couple of protests. As celebrities arrived for Sunday's Academy
Awards, scores of demonstrators stood outside the Shrine Auditorium
waving signs.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-abortion protesters demonstrated against ''The Cider House
Rules,'' in which Michael Caine, in a role that won him an Oscar,
portrays a kindly doctor at a New England orphanage who also
performs abortions.
</P>
<P>
   One protester held a sign proclaiming, ''Cider House Reeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Not far away, other protesters demonstrated against movies that
are filmed outside the United States to take advantage of tax
breaks and cheaper labor in countries like Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bring Hollywood Back to Hollywood'' read one of their signs.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   ''Toy Story 2'' director John Lasseter brought three of his best
friends to the Academy Awards: Woody, Buzz Lightyear and Jessie the
Cowgirl.
</P>
<P>
   The toy-sized versions of the movie's stars were on hand to
present the Oscar for best animated short film.
</P>
<P>
   Buzz wore his usual spaceman attire, highlighted with a bow tie,
while Woody and Jessie bowed to Oscar fashion and donned sequined
Western garb.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   She grew up seeing Oscar at her grandmother's house, says
actress Angelina Jolie, whose father, Jon Voight, won one for
''Coming Home'' in 1978. But she never got to touch the award until
she claimed her own on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Jolie, who won for best supporting actress for ''Girl,
Interrupted,'' said her father's Oscar was kept under a fishbowl at
his mother's house, where it was made clear to her that she was not
to touch it.
</P>
<P>
   ''I never actually held one,'' said Jolie. ''It was always just
this strange thing in your grandma's house.''
</P>
<P>
   Jolie almost didn't get to hold her own Oscar on Sunday.
Arriving late after the Oscar show started, she and her brother had
to talk their way past security guards, who allowed them to sprint
to their seats while the cameras were focused on host Billy
Crystal.

<HEADLINE> Michael Caine Takes Home Oscar  </HEADLINE>
By BOB THOMAS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Michael Caine, the kindly orphanage
headmaster in ''The Cider House Rules,'' won his second best
supporting actor Oscar on Sunday. Angelina Jolie, the disruptive
mental patient in ''Girl, Interrupted,'' won for supporting actress
-- a generation after her father took home an Oscar.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Matrix,'' the story of a computer hacker who discovers
life is a big illusion, won four Oscars -- for film editing, sound,
sound effects editing and visual effects.
</P>
<P>
   With all but the top four awards to be presented, leading
nominee ''American Beauty'' had won for original screenplay, by
Alan Ball, and for cinematography, while co-favorite ''The Cider
House Rules'' earned the adapted screenplay Oscar for John Irving.
</P>
<P>
   Irving offered thanks for recognition of a film that deals with
abortion and concluded by thanking ''everyone at Planned Parenthood
and the National Abortion Rights League'' -- which got thunderous
applause.
</P>
<P>
   Caine, 67, who previously won as supporting actor for ''Hannah
and Her Sisters'' in 1986, seemed overwhelmed by the applause that
greeted the announcement by Judi Dench and he saluted his fellow
nominees.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm basically up here guys to represent you as what I hope you
will all be -- a survivor,'' Caine told the star-studded Shrine
Auditorium audience.
</P>
<P>
   The 24-year-old Jolie thanked her father, Jon Voight, a best
actor winner for 1978's ''Coming Home'' and a nominee for 1969's
''Midnight Cowboy,'' saying: ''You're a great actor, but a better
father.''
</P>
<P>
   Pop star Phil Collins scored the best original song award for
his sentimental ''You'll be in My Heart'' from the animated Disney
film ''Tarzan.'' It was his first win in three nominations.
</P>
<P>
   Collins thanked his three children who, he said, ''really wrote
this song for me.''
</P>
<P>
   The award followed a rousing performance of the bawdy ''Blame
Canada'' from ''South Park: Bigger, Longer &AMP; Uncut.'' Robin
Williams led the chorus in a production number, even though the
show's producers swore there would be none.
</P>
<P>
   Best original score went to John Corigliano for ''The Red
Violin.'' The art direction trophy went to ''Sleepy Hollow.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Topsy-Turvy,'' a drama about the creation of the Gilbert and
Sullivan operetta ''The Mikado,'' won two awards -- for makeup and
costume design.
</P>
<P>
   The live action short award went to ''My Mother Dreams the
Satan's Disciples in New York'' and animated short Oscar went to
''The Old Man and the Sea.'' Documentary honors went to the short
''King Gimp'' and the feature ''One Day in September.''
</P>
<P>
   Spain's ''All About My Mother'' won best foreign film, prompting
one of the night's humorous moments. When director Pedro
Almodovar's acceptance speech began to run long and presenter
Antonio Banderas pretended to pull him off the stage.
</P>
<P>
   ''American Beauty'' topped most critic lists going into the
ceremony, and it was named best picture in Friday's controversial
Wall Street Journal poll of 356 of the 5,607 voting Academy
members.
</P>
<P>
   Scientific or not, the survey was ''American Beauty's'' clincher
for best buzz going into the Oscar show, broadcast on ABC with
Billy Crystal as host.
</P>
<P>
   The poll's other favorites also seemed to reflect pre-Oscar
conventional wisdom: Denzel Washington for leading actor in ''The
Hurricane,'' Hilary Swank for leading actress in ''Boys Don't
Cry,'' Caine for supporting actor and Jolie for supporting actress.
</P>
<P>
   When the nominations were announced, ''American Beauty'' and
''The Cider House Rules'' were leading contenders for best picture.
The standing of ''The Cider House Rules'' heightened as Miramax put
on an ad blitz. DreamWorks countered with a campaign for ''American
Beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   The awards show capped one of the most bizarre Oscar seasons.
</P>
<P>
   First, a large number of the ballots were delayed in the mail,
and the academy had to print new ballots. The academy also extended
the voting deadline a few days to last Thursday, meaning the
accountants had to work overtime on awards weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Then a shipment of 55 shiny new Oscar statuettes from the
Chicago manufacturer disappeared from a loading dock at Roadway
Express on March 8. Salvage man Willie Fulgear stumbled across 52
of the missing awards while rummaging through a trash container.
Three Oscars remain missing.
</P>
<P>
   Fulgear, 61, became an instant celebrity. He was given a $50,000
reward by the shipping company and two tickets to Sunday's show.
</P>
<P>
   ''Willie got $50,000 for finding the 52 Oscars. That's not a lot
of money when you realize that Miramax and DreamWorks are spending
millions of dollars just to get one,'' Crystal quipped as he
pointed out the Oscar hero during the program's opening number.
</P>
<P>
   A Roadway Express trucker was charged with stealing the
statuettes.
</P>
<P>
   The academy earlier announced the evening's special awards:
Warren Beatty was named for the Irving Thalberg Award for a high
level of producing, and Andrzej Wajda, premier director of Poland,
won an honorary award ''for showing both the loftiest heights and
the darkest depths of the European soul.''

<HEADLINE> Hillary Clinton picks up first third-party endorsement  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT, AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton has picked up the
first political party endorsement of her Senate campaign against
New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   The endorsement of the first lady from the Working Families
Party came Sunday as a statewide poll reported that Giuliani's lead
of three weeks ago had disappeared and that the race was now a
statistical dead heat.
</P>
<P>
   ''I consider this the beginning of a partnership,'' Clinton told
the Working Families Party convention in Albany.
</P>
<P>
   Promising to be 'a voice and a vote'' in the Senate for working
families, the first lady said ''my opponent and his fellow
Republicans want us to do a U-turn back to the 1980s where we had
skyrocketing deficits and disinvestment ... I'm not just someone
who says I'm for family values, I'm for valuing families.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrat Clinton left the heavy Giuliani bashing to others at
the gathering of the small, labor union-backed third party.
</P>
<P>
   ''They say if you want to keep the beer real cold, put it next
to Rudy's heart,'' said Jim Hightower, a radio talk-show host and
former Texas agriculture commissioner, to the cheers of the almost
1,000 party loyalists on hand.
</P>
<P>
   Greeting those attending the party convention were some fliers
made up to look like wanted posters and featuring a caricature of
the Republican mayor. The fliers charged the New York City mayor
with ''crimes against humanity'' and said ''he has been known to
use the alias Adolph.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry Moskowitz, labor coordinator for the Working Families
Party, said ''we absolutely do not subscribe to this'' and
maintained that if party leaders had seen those passing out the
fliers, ''they would have been stopped.''
</P>
<P>
   The fliers purported to be from a group called the Citywide
Coalition to Stop Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   The Working Families Party was created in New York two years ago
to push the Democratic Party toward the left.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton has shunned the liberal label, insisting she is a
''New Democrat'' with a middle-of-the-road agenda, the backing of
the Working Families Party provides the Giuliani camp with another
opportunity to paint her as a left-leaning politician.
</P>
<P>
   Minor party endorsements can be valuable in the race because
unlike other states, New York allows major party candidates to add
votes cast for them on third party ballot lines to their overall
vote total. That can make the difference in close elections.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is expected to have the Democratic Party endorsement
while Giuliani appears to have a lock on the Republican line.
</P>
<P>
   The support for Clinton came as a New York Post poll conducted
by Zogby International showed the first lady favored by 45 percent
of likely voters to 42 percent for the New York City mayor, a
statistical tie. A Zogby poll conducted three weeks ago had
Giuliani leading the first lady, 49 percent to 42 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Pollster John Zogby attributed the shift, in part, to voter
dissatisfaction with the mayor's handling of the shooting 10 days
ago of an unarmed black man, Patrick Dorismond, by New York City
police.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's handing her the race,'' Zogby said.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has come under fire for having police release
Dorismond's criminal record, including sealed juvenile records,
instead of consoling the family. On Saturday, after Dorismond's
funeral, mourners and police clashed in New York City leaving
people injured on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   Zogby's telephone poll of 710 likely voters was conducted Friday
and Saturday and has a margin of error of plus or minus 4
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Two other statewide polls -- by Marist College's Institute for
Public Opinion and by the Quinnipiac College Polling Institute --
taken before the Dorismond shooting had shown Giuliani with slight
leads over the first lady. A CBS News-New York Times poll had shown
the race even.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in an interview with the issue of New York magazine
due out today, Clinton said one of the advantages she brings to the
Senate campaign and her potential service in the Senate is a thick
skin.
</P>
<P>
   ''Part of what I bring is that there is nothing anybody can say
about me that will hurt my feelings, '' she told the magazine. ''I
cannot be insulted. You know, I just can't be.''

<HEADLINE> Schumer asks Clinton to tap federal oil reserves  </HEADLINE>
By L. ANNE NEWELL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- U.S. Sen. Charles Schumer said tapping
federal oil reserves could force OPEC into releasing more oil to
the United States and other petroleum-hungry countries in its
semi-annual meeting today.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer's announcement came on the eve of what many describe as
the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries' most
important meeting in 20 years. OPEC ministers will meet in Vienna,
Austria today to review global oil markets.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer, a Democrat, asked President Clinton to utilize the
Strategic Oil Reserve for the first time in nearly a decade through
a swap program that would replenish supplies when prices fall. It
would also nearly double the size of the reserve, stockpiling 1
billion barrels.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is our last chance to get gas prices back down before the
summer driving season,'' Schumer said. ''We should immediately tell
OPEC nations that if they don't increase their output to two
million barrels a day, we will tap the Strategic Oil Reserve.''
</P>
<P>
   OPEC oil ministers are expected to reach an agreement that would
boost petroleum supplies, but have not shown willingness to boost
production by the 2 million to 2.5 million barrels per day that the
United States and other industrial powers want.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, analysts predict OPEC will raise its daily output by
about 1 million barrels, an amount many say won't be enough to
simultaneously replenish depleted oil inventories, meet seasonal
needs for gasoline and push down prices. Kuwait's oil minister,
Sheikh Saud Nasser al-Sabah, said Sunday OPEC could raise its
official production by as much as 1.7 million barrels of crude a
day.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has previously said it will not
decide until after the OPEC meeting whether to draw some of the
nearly 570 million barrels of oil in the Strategic Oil Reserve.
</P>
<P>
   The reserve, created in 1975 after the Arab oil embargo, is
intended to provide a stopgap in case of disruptions in oil
imports. It has been used only once, during the Gulf War in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer began petitioning Clinton to release the federal
reserves in September and co-introduced legislation to allow easier
access to the reserves two months later. He said Sunday the
administration may have been reluctant to release reserves because
it didn't want to use strong-arm tactics with OPEC.
</P>
<P>
   ''They may have thought diplomacy would work,'' Schumer said.
''But look at its effects.''
</P>
<P>
   Schumer predicted gasoline prices will rise to as much as two
dollars a gallon this summer if neither the federal reserves are
tapped nor OPEC supplies increased.
</P>
<P>
   He also predicted it could undermine upstate New York's economy
-- with residents paying as much as $2,000 a year for gasoline -- and
lead to increased federal taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only argument against (my plan) is that it may not work,''
Schumer said. ''My answer is nothing else has worked.''

Putin Wins Russian Elections
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Vladimir Putin scored a convincing victory Monday in Russia's
presidential election with his promise to clean up the country after years of
political chaos and restore it as a global power. With 94 percent of the vote
counted, Putin had an unassailable lead with 52.5 percent of the vote, according
to election officials. Communist Gennady Zyuganov, who presented a surprisingly
strong challenge, was in second place with 29.45 percent. Although Putin managed
to avoid being forced into a runoff vote against Zyuganov, his victory was less
than the huge win that had been expected for the former KGB officer.

Gore Plan Would Create House Fund

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore has drafted campaign finance reform
proposals that include a $7.1 billion endowment to pay for House and Senate
campaigns and rules that would have identified the pro-George W. Bush financiers
of controversial primary-season TV ads, his campaign aides said Sunday. Gore,
who recently said he was putting campaign reform front-and-center in his
Democratic presidential race, planned to unveil the proposals during a campaign
stop Monday in Milwaukee. As first reported in Monday's editions of The
Washington Post, Gore was proposing to create a ''Democracy Endowment,'' new
disclosure rules for lobbyists and outside groups that pay for political ads,
and mandatory free ''rebuttal'' air time for candidates targeted by such
third-party ads.

Clinton, Assad Fall Short on Talks

   GENEVA (AP) -- President Clinton and Syrian President Hafez Assad failed to

during three hours of face-to-face talks Assad stressed the importance of
Syria's long demand for an Israeli pullback to the country's 1967 borders. White
House spokesman Joe Lockhart said the meeting as ''very useful.'' But, he added,
''we don't believe it would be productive'' for Syrian-Israeli talks to resume

Study: Cops Fail To Report Force

   LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Police in Louisville don't always report their use of

serious flaws, according to a 10-month investigation by The Courier-Journal.
Arrests reports obtained by the newspaper for a story today show officers

Castro: Elian Will Return to Cuba

   HAVANA (AP) -- President Fidel Castro declared Sunday that the Miami
relatives of 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez had lost their battle to keep the child
in the United States and that it was only a matter of time before the boy was
reunited with his father in Cuba. ''The Cuban mafia has lost,'' an animated
Castro insisted before hundreds of pro-government university students gathered
to press for the child's return to his communist homeland. U.S. District Judge
K. Michael Moore's dismissal on Tuesday of the family's lawsuit seeking to block
Elian's repatriation was ''just and moral,'' Castro said.

presented a surprisingly strong challenge, was in second place with
29.45 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Although Putin managed to avoid being forced into a runoff vote
against Zyuganov, his victory was less than the huge win that had
been expected for the former KGB officer. Putin's call to
strengthen the authority of the state and the security forces
worried some Russians, who fear the country's democratic reforms
could be rolled back.
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging the scale of the problems facing him, Putin said
early Monday he would not make any promises of quick improvements
after a decade of economic and political upheaval.
</P>
<P>
   ''The level of expectations is very high -- people are tired and
struggling and they're hoping for things to get better, but
miracles don't happen,'' he said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Liberal economist Grigory Yavlinsky was projected to take third
place with about 7 percent of the vote. The other eight candidates
lagged far behind.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the election outcome was clear, Zyuganov accused the
government of falsifying the results, saying the Communist vote was
more than 40 percent. There were no immediate reports on the
fairness of the election from international monitors.
</P>
<P>
   ''They have set up a zone of blanket fraud to cheat citizens,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's campaign had wanted a huge victory to give him a strong
mandate for his call to impose strong government, crack down on
corruption and get the economy working.
</P>
<P>
   Putin may have suffered from the widespread assumption that he
would win, convincing many of his supporters that there was no need
to vote. But the fairly strong vote for Zyuganov was also seen as a
protest vote by Russians unhappy about Putin's apparently
inevitable victory.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, looking relaxed, said he was confident of victory as he
voted Sunday at a Moscow polling station. ''Tomorrow is Monday, a
hard day, and I will have to go to work,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Putin acknowledged the Communists had done well despite their
cash-strapped campaign and that his government would have to take
popular discontent into account. He said he would consider bringing
opposition groups into the government if they shared his views.
</P>
<P>
   ''That means that our policy must be more balanced, take into
account the existing realities and aim at increasing living
standards,'' he told journalists.
</P>
<P>
   The tough, man-of-action image that Putin cultivates appeals to
many Russians, tired of the uncertainty and mayhem of the final
years of former President Boris Yeltsin. Putin has promised to end
massive corruption, revive the economy after years of recession and
restore the political and military influence that Moscow wielded
before the Soviet collapse.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm tired of all this disorder,'' said Vladimir Prishchev, a
pensioner casting his ballot for Putin in Russia's Pacific port
city of Vladivostok, where graft is rampant and life miserable for
most people. ''When Putin takes charge of something, he takes it to
the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Russians, particularly liberals, fear Putin may trample
Russia's fragile democracy and restore the iron control the secret
police enforced during the Soviet era.
</P>
<P>
   But some Russian reformers and Western officials and businessmen
have praised Putin as a pragmatic reformer who will restore
stability in Russia and improve people's lives by making reforms
work.
</P>
<P>
   With a trademark poker face, Putin comes across as stern and
colorless, often cold. He is described often as resembling the
archetypal ''chekist'' or secret policeman -- which appeals to many
Russians who believe tough government alone can clean up the
country and restore stability.
</P>
<P>
   Putin insists he is a democrat, but he has been vague about his
plans beyond stressing the need for strong government.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts say Putin has few specific plans because of his
rapid rise to power and it may be months before his intentions are
clear. Nor is Putin likely to turn things around quickly after
decades of authoritarianism and economic disintegration, they add.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin, who stunned Russians by resigning six months early and
dubbing Putin as his political heir, said Sunday he was confident
that the younger leader would continue the reforms set in place
after the Soviet collapse.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody is waiting for change,'' said Yeltsin after casting
his ballot. ''There will be some changes, but the main thing is the
course of reform must stay, and it will stay. I am convinced of
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin, who rose through a series of mostly obscure government
posts in the 1990s and has never held elected office, was appointed
prime minister by Yeltsin in August. He gained immediate popularity
for his vigorous image and his tough handling of the war in
Chechnya. Putin was named acting president when Yeltsin resigned
six months early.
</P>
<P>
   Little is known about Putin and extensive checks by journalists
and others in recent months have produced more questions and few
insights. Unlike many prominent officials, Putin has not been
linked to major corruption, boosting his image in the eyes of
Russians who have seen political insiders amass vast fortunes while
living standards for most people plummeted.

<HEADLINE> Kevin Spacey Named Best Actor  </HEADLINE>
By BOB THOMAS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Kevin Spacey won his second Academy Award
Sunday night for playing an alienated suburban husband in
''American Beauty,'' and Hilary Swank, who portrayed a woman
passing as a man in ''Boys Don't Cry,'' won best actress.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Caine, the kindly orphanage headmaster in ''The Cider
House Rules,'' won his second best supporting actor Oscar at the
72nd Academy Awards. Angelina Jolie, the disruptive mental patient
in ''Girl, Interrupted,'' won for supporting actress -- a generation
after her father took home an Oscar.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Matrix,'' the story of a computer hacker who discovers
life is a big illusion, won four Oscars -- for film editing, sound,
sound effects editing and visual effects.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everyone put their heart and their soul into this movie,''
said Swank, 25, who bested a field including Annette Bening of
''American Beauty,'' Meryl Streep of ''Music of the Heart,'' Janet
McTeer of ''Tumbleweeds'' and Julianne Moore of ''The End of the
Affair.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm stunned and I'm speechless,'' Spacey said.
</P>
<P>
   With all but the top three awards to be presented, leading
nominee ''American Beauty'' had won for original screenplay, by
Alan Ball, and for cinematography, while co-favorite ''The Cider
House Rules'' earned the adapted screenplay Oscar for John Irving.
</P>
<P>
   Irving offered thanks for recognition of a film that deals with
abortion and concluded by thanking ''everyone at Planned Parenthood
and the National Abortion Rights League'' -- which got thunderous
applause.
</P>
<P>
   Caine, 67, who previously won as supporting actor for ''Hannah
and Her Sisters'' in 1986, seemed overwhelmed by the applause that
greeted the announcement by Judi Dench and he saluted his fellow
nominees.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm basically up here guys to represent you as what I hope you
will all be -- a survivor,'' Caine told the star-studded Shrine
Auditorium audience.
</P>
<P>
   The 24-year-old Jolie thanked her father, Jon Voight, a best
actor winner for 1978's ''Coming Home'' and a nominee for 1969's
''Midnight Cowboy,'' saying: ''You're a great actor, but a better
father.''
</P>
<P>
   Pop star Phil Collins scored the best original song award for
his sentimental ''You'll be in My Heart'' from the animated Disney
film ''Tarzan.'' It was his first win in three nominations.
</P>
<P>
   Collins thanked his three children who, he said, ''really wrote
this song for me.''
</P>
<P>
   The award followed a rousing performance of the bawdy ''Blame
Canada'' from ''South Park: Bigger, Longer &AMP; Uncut.'' Robin
Williams led the chorus in a production number, even though the
show's producers swore there would be none.
</P>
<P>
   Best original score went to John Corigliano for ''The Red
Violin.'' The art direction trophy went to ''Sleepy Hollow.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Topsy-Turvy,'' a drama about the creation of the Gilbert and
Sullivan operetta ''The Mikado,'' won two awards -- for makeup and
costume design.
</P>
<P>
   The live action short award went to ''My Mother Dreams the
Satan's Disciples in New York'' and animated short Oscar went to
''The Old Man and the Sea.'' Documentary honors went to the short
''King Gimp'' and the feature ''One Day in September.''
</P>
<P>
   Spain's ''All About My Mother'' won best foreign film, prompting
one of the night's humorous moments. When director Pedro
Almodovar's acceptance speech began to run long and presenter
Antonio Banderas pretended to pull him off the stage.
</P>
<P>
   ''American Beauty'' topped most critic lists going into the
ceremony, and it was named best picture in Friday's controversial
Wall Street Journal poll of 356 of the 5,607 voting Academy
members.
</P>
<P>
   Scientific or not, the survey was ''American Beauty's'' clincher
for best buzz going into the Oscar show, broadcast on ABC with
Billy Crystal as host.
</P>
<P>
   The poll's other favorites also seemed to reflect pre-Oscar
conventional wisdom: Denzel Washington for leading actor in ''The
Hurricane,'' Swank for leading actress in ''Boys Don't Cry,'' Caine
for supporting actor and Jolie for supporting actress.
</P>
<P>
   When the nominations were announced, ''American Beauty'' and
''The Cider House Rules'' were leading contenders for best picture.
The standing of ''The Cider House Rules'' heightened as Miramax put
on an ad blitz. DreamWorks countered with a campaign for ''American
Beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   The awards show capped one of the most bizarre Oscar seasons.
</P>
<P>
   First, a large number of the ballots were delayed in the mail,
and the academy had to print new ballots. The academy also extended
the voting deadline a few days to last Thursday, meaning the
accountants had to work overtime on awards weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Then a shipment of 55 shiny new Oscar statuettes from the
Chicago manufacturer disappeared from a loading dock at Roadway
Express on March 8. Salvage man Willie Fulgear stumbled across 52
of the missing awards while rummaging through a trash container.
Three Oscars remain missing.
</P>
<P>
   Fulgear, 61, became an instant celebrity. He was given a $50,000
reward by the shipping company and two tickets to Sunday's show.
</P>
<P>
   ''Willie got $50,000 for finding the 52 Oscars. That's not a lot
of money when you realize that Miramax and DreamWorks are spending
millions of dollars just to get one,'' Crystal quipped as he
pointed out the Oscar hero during the program's opening number.
</P>
<P>
   A Roadway Express trucker was charged with stealing the
statuettes.
</P>
<P>
   The academy earlier announced the evening's special awards:
Warren Beatty was named for the Irving Thalberg Award for a high
level of producing, and Andrzej Wajda, premier director of Poland,
won an honorary award ''for showing both the loftiest heights and
the darkest depths of the European soul.''

<HEADLINE> 'All About My Mother' Wins Oscar  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Just like last year, you could guess by the
presenters who would win the Oscar for foreign language film
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   After Spanish-speaking actors Penelope Cruz and Antonio Banderas
read the five nominees, Cruz announced the winner was fellow
countryman Pedro Almodovar's ''All About My Mother.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Pedro!'' shouted Cruz, who appeared in the film. It was a
scene reminiscent of last year's excited pronouncement by Sophia
Loren when she revealed ''Life is Beautiful'' had won by
exclaiming, ''Roberto!'' -- the first name of fellow Italian Roberto
Benigni.
</P>
<P>
   This year's winner was no surprise. ''All About My Mother,'' the
story of a woman in search of her dead son's father, was widely
praised as Almodovar's best film in years. It also gave Spain its
third foreign language Oscar.
</P>
<P>
   Almodovar, previously nominated for his wild 1988 comedy ''Women
on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown,'' struggled with his English
through a rambling acceptance speech. At one point he thanked his
fellow countrymen who were watching the awards show in Spain at
''six years in the morning.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This is for Spain,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Almodovar's characters tend to run on, the director's
speech ran overtime, prompting the orchestra to start playing while
he was still speaking. When Almodovar ignored the music, Banderas
tugged at his arm to jokingly pull him off stage.

<HEADLINE> Suns 90, Warriors 82  </HEADLINE>
By BOB BAUM, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- Penny Hardaway scored 27 of his season-high 33
points in the first half and the Phoenix Suns nearly blew a
25-point lead before pulling out a 90-82 victory over the Golden
State Warriors Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Hardaway made all 10 of his field goal tries as Phoenix took a
63-40 halftime lead, but the Suns fell apart in the second half,
scoring a season-low 27 points and committing 14 turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Marion added 15 points, 14 rebounds and five blocked shots
for Phoenix, in its second game since starting point guard Jason
Kidd broke his left ankle. But Marion was scoreless, going 0-for-5
from the field, in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Donyell Marshall scored 28 points and grabbed 11 rebounds for
the Warriors, who lost their fifth in a row and 13th in their last
14 games. Larry Hughes added 16 points but made just four of 15
shots.
</P>
<P>
   Hardaway's two free throws gave the Suns their biggest
first-half lead, 62-37, 24.3 seconds before the break.
</P>
<P>
   But Golden State outscored Phoenix 15-4 to start the third
quarter to cut the Suns' lead to 67-55 on Marshall's two free
throws with 3:35 to go in the period.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix, which has won six of seven, re-built a 75-60 lead after
three quarters, but the Warriors came back again, outscoring the
Suns 13-4 to start the fourth quarter and cut it to 79-73 when
Marion was called for goaltending on Marshall's shot with 7:41 to
play.
</P>
<P>
   Despite turnovers and missed free throws, the Suns pulled it
out. Randy Livingston's two free throws with 5:13 to play gave
Phoenix an 84-75 lead, then Hardaway scored on a breakaway layup to
make it 86-75 with 3:29 to go.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes' 3-pointer sliced the lead to 86-78 with 3:08 to go, but
Hardaway sealed the victory by making four consecutive free throws.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns were 9-for-34 (26 percent) from the field in the second
half after shooting 60 percent (24-for-40) in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   In the first half, Marion was 6-for-7 from the field, grabbed 10
rebounds and blocked four shots. But he was overshadowed by
Hardaway, who put on a dazzling array of offensive moves against
Hughes and Vontego Cummings.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix took charge with a 27-6 surge, including 14 consecutive
points, to go up 57-33 on Hardaway's three-point play with 2:49
left in the half.
</P>
<P>
@Notes: Kevin Johnson, coaxed out of retirement the day after Kidd
was injured, was on the Phoenix bench in street clothes. He got a
standing ovation from the crowd when he was introduced in the third
quarter. ... Johnson will accompany the Suns on their four-game
road trip and may play at Miami on Tuesday. ... The Suns are 30-6
at home. ... Phoenix has beaten the Warriors 10 consecutive times
at America West Arena. ... The Suns were 0-for-12 from 3-point
range.

   MOSCOW (AP) -- Fighting off a last-minute Communist surge, Vladimir Putin
scored a convincing victory Monday in presidential elections after promising to
end years of political chaos and restore Russia as a global power. With 94
percent of the vote counted, Putin had an unassailable lead with 52.5 percent

Communist Gennady Zyuganov, who presented a surprisingly strong challenge, was

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore has drafted campaign finance reform
proposals that include a $7.1 billion endowment to pay for House and Senate
campaigns and rules that would have identified the pro-George W. Bush financiers
of controversial primary-season TV ads, his campaign aides said Sunday. Gore,
who recently said he was putting campaign reform front-and-center in his
Democratic presidential race, planned to unveil the proposals during a campaign
stop Monday in Milwaukee. As first reported in Monday's editions of The
Washington Post, Gore was proposing to create a ''Democracy Endowment,'' new
disclosure rules for lobbyists and outside groups that pay for political ads,
and mandatory free ''rebuttal'' air time for candidates targeted by such
third-party ads.

Syria's long demand for an Israeli pullback to the country's 1967 borders. White

<HEADLINE> Report: Braves To Trade Rocker  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HACKENSACK, N.J. (AP) -- The Atlanta Braves are about to trade
away closer John Rocker, according to a published report.
</P>
<P>
   The Record of Hackensack reports in Monday's editions that a
''highly placed baseball official'' said Atlanta and the Montreal
Expos are on the verge of a deal that would swap Rocker for closer
Ugueth Urbina.
</P>
<P>
   The deal has been discussed all spring, but is getting closer to
being finalized, the source told the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   The delay has been discussions about who else might be included.
The Braves would prefer to make a straight swap, but the Expos want
another pitcher, preferably starter Bruce Chen.
</P>
<P>
   Urbina led the National League with 41 saves last year.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker, who had 38 saves and a 2.49 ERA, was suspended for all
of spring training and the first 28 days of the season by
commissioner Bud Selig after the reliever's disparaging comments
about minorities, gays and foreigners were published. But an
arbitrator allowed him to report March 2 and cut the regular-season
suspension to two weeks.

<HEADLINE> Cancun Becomes Spring Break Capital  </HEADLINE>
By NIKO PRICE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CANCUN, Mexico (AP) -- ''Idaho in the house!'' the host screamed
as he bent down from the stage to pour tequila into a conga line of
open mouths yelling out their hometowns. Arms thrust upward to form
the letters of the Village People's ''YMCA,'' and patrons and
waiters alike clambered onto the tables to gain altitude.
</P>
<P>
   Some had gained a little too much: a young woman weaved toward
the bathroom to expel a few of her industrial-sized margaritas.
</P>
<P>
   This is spring break in Cancun, a resort that has steadily grown
into a world capital of the mid-March binge of sea, sand, spirits
and sex that is a rite of passage for American college students.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving behind traditional spring break spots like Daytona
Beach, Fla., and South Padre Island, Texas, a record number of U.S.
college students have descended on Cancun this year, turning the
resort into the hottest party spot there is.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been to Florida and Las Vegas. Cancun is undisputed.
There's no contest. This is the best spring break in the entire
world,'' said Greg Armentrout, a 21-year-old football player from
the University of California, Los Angeles, as he surveyed the
packed dance floor of a local disco.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody's friendly. The women are beautiful. There's always
something to do, day and night. There's never a boring moment
unless you're sleeping -- and that's not boring because you're with
a woman.''
</P>
<P>
   Cancun has been building 1,000 new hotel rooms a year for years,
but still hit a record 100 percent occupancy a week ago. That means
many students showing up with confirmed reservations had to be
bused off to nearby resorts.
</P>
<P>
   As spring break begins to wind down, Cancun is at 85 percent
capacity -- extraordinary for late March, tourism officials say. And
by any estimates, next year will only be busier.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've had 70,000 spring breakers in the last four weeks,''
said Laura Fernandez de Gordoa, Cancun's municipal tourism
director. ''We have 26,000 rooms, but we need at least 33,000.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida is still the top spring break destination in terms of
sheer numbers, travel agents say. But that's because it's easy to
pile into a car and hit the beach. In terms of spring breaks that
require planning and a little more money, Cancun is now king.
</P>
<P>
   The routine is pretty standard: Wake up by 1 p.m., hang out on
the beach, shower, eat, and hit the discos until 5 a.m. After that,
there's the obligatory after-hours party at the hotel, sunrise on
the beach, and bedtime at 7 or 8 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   MTV films kids wriggling in their bikinis. E! Entertainment
Television scours the beach for lurid footage. Hotels organize wet
T-shirt contests on the beach. Jose Cuervo and Corona sponsor
events at discos that compete for the word-of-mouth title of the
least-inhibited party.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the place to be for spring break. Everybody knows it,''
said Katie McDonald, a 19-year-old sophomore at the State
University of New York, Geneseo.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have the beaches. Then there's the nightlife. And it helps
that the drinking age is 18.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the students enjoy meeting people from colleges across
the United States -- even if they have to come to Mexico to do it.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of the people in Florida are locals,'' said Dawn Hylen,
a 22-year-old recent graduate of the University of Tennessee. ''A
lot of Harley Davidson types.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the revelers can get out of hand, but Cancun officials
said more police, education campaigns and an agreement by discos to
make last call at 4 a.m. have reduced problems this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've made about 60 arrests this spring break. That's less
than last year,'' said Angel Lopez, spokesman for the state police
office in Cancun. ''Even so, the kids drink alcohol in industrial
quantities and they go crazy.'' Most of those arrested are fined
and let go.
</P>
<P>
   The great majority of students don't get into trouble, which is
hard to do with a drinking age of 18 and an anything-goes attitude.
Besides, most of the students are just here to have fun.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ninety-nine out of 100 students don't pee in public places or
dance in front of MTV cameras with a string bikini on,'' said Kirk
Riley, president of hotspringbreaks.com. ''Most hang out by the
beach, buy little brother a T-shirt and buy mom a hammock. They're
here to dance and lie out in the sun.''

<HEADLINE> Meals delivered for free, no questions asked  </HEADLINE>
By JIM FITZGERALD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PURCHASE, N.Y. (AP) -- Tara Eliason was hungry but didn't want to
leave her dorm room. It was noon on the day before spring break at
Manhattanville College and ''everything's due today,'' the junior
economics major said. ''If I go to the cafeteria, I won't get it
all done.''
</P>
<P>
   Heather Singleton, on the other hand, had plenty of time to walk
to the cafeteria; she just didn't feel like going. The sophomore's
classes were all finished, and she was still in her pajamas at
lunchtime, watching Jenny Jones on television.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought it'd be cool to have a meal delivered,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Consider it done. Manhattanville, a private college just north
of New York City that costs $26,000 a year, has room service -- just
like a hotel.
</P>
<P>
   The difference is the student, unlike a hotel guest, can't call
every day. But up to three times a semester, dorm residents can
call the day before, order an entree, two side dishes and a
beverage and request a delivery time.
</P>
<P>
   It works for breakfast (7:30 a.m. to 9:30 a.m.), lunch (11 a.m.
to 1 p.m.) and dinner (4 p.m. to 6 p.m.). There is no added cost.
</P>
<P>
   Such hotel-like service is still rare on the nation's campuses,
but experts say it's likely to spread as colleges compete for
students.
</P>
<P>
   ''Before long, we'll be seeing a dorm concierge,'' said Ray
Mulligan, regional vice president for Flik International Corp.,
which provides Manhattanville's food service.
</P>
<P>
   So at about 12:30 p.m. last Friday, Assistant Catering Director
Alma Mojica knocked on the door of Eliason's dorm room, with its
Rugrats bedspread and ''Dawson's Creek'' poster. She carried an
insulated red bag over her shoulder. Inside, carefully wrapped,
were a cheeseburger with lettuce and tomato, waffle fries and a
bottle of Slice -- just what Eliason ordered. The burger was plenty
hot, the soda cold enough. There was a container of ketchup, a
fork, a spoon, a straw and napkins.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is great,'' said the 20-year-old from Queens, eating at
her desk, maintaining her 3.8 grade point average.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a turkey-and-bacon club sandwich, a green salad and
fries, plus a Pepsi, had been delivered to Singleton's room across
campus, with its Three Stooges-Clint Eastwood motif. The
19-year-old from Honolulu, also a 3.8 student, was delighted.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's nice once in a while to be able to eat in bed,'' she
said. ''I'm a long way from home. It's not like I can pop in on Mom
and get pampered.''
</P>
<P>
   Mojica, the caterer, said she has averaged five or six
deliveries a day -- ''maybe 15 when it rains'' -- since the program
began two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''The first was a guy with an injured foot,'' she remembered.
''Sometimes they're studying hard, sometimes not. But we don't ask
them why they want it delivered.''
</P>
<P>
   College President Richard Berman said room service fits in with
his ''student-driven'' policies, which have helped double the
enrollment to 1,300 since he took over five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''We keep the library open until 4 a.m. We keep the financial
aid office open on Saturdays,'' he said. ''If students are happier,
our retention is better, and if our retention is better our
recruitment will be better.
</P>
<P>
   ''Room service sounds a little absurd, probably, but there are
times when kids just are studying or don't feel well. If they were
in any other setting somebody would bring them a meal or they would
order Chinese in. ... If you're eating every day in a cafeteria for
10 months, it gets a little stale, no matter how great it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Flik is part of the global Compass Group, which also includes
Chartwell's, another company that caters to schools.
</P>
<P>
   Mulligan said the University of Miami, Southwest Texas State
University and a couple of others among the 250 schools served by
Flik and Chartwell's have room service like Manhattanville's, where
a full meal is available and it doesn't cost extra. But many have
pizza or sandwich delivery for cash.
</P>
<P>
   ''Competition on college campuses has brought us to a place
where student services is what sells,'' he said. ''The 'Animal
House,' food-fight type of service is gone. If you've been to a
college cafeteria lately you know that it's almost a
restaurant-type setting.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Manhattanville's cafeteria offered a bright view of the
campus, sparkling tables and a bewildering variety of food in
addition to the standard burgers and pizza -- eggplant parmigiana,
broiled fish, rice pilaf, pasta with clam or marinara sauce, baked
sweet potatoes, a separate area with Chinese food, a little ice
cream parlor, a coffee bar.
</P>
<P>
   Singleton, though happy with the hand-delivered lunch, said
she'd be back in the cafeteria many times before using her two
remaining room-service calls.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm saving them for finals,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Swank Wins for Gender-Bending Role  </HEADLINE>
By ERICA WERNER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Hilary Swank chopped her hair off, wore her
husband's clothes to her audition and ran her everyday errands as a
man.
</P>
<P>
   From her first day on the set of ''Boys Don't Cry,'' she refused
to let cast and crew see her as anyone but Brandon Teena, a young
woman in rural Nebraska living life as a man.
</P>
<P>
   That work paid off Sunday with a best actress Oscar.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have come a long way. To think that this movie wouldn't
have been made 3 1-2 years ago and we made it now for under $2
million, and now this, is quite remarkable,'' Swank said, glowing
but composed, in accepting her award.
</P>
<P>
   Swank, 25, was the youngest of the five nominees and the only
unknown in a field that included Annette Bening, cited for her role
as an unhappy suburbanite in ''American Beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   The harrowing, gender-bending ''Boys Don't Cry'' was based on
the true story of Teena, killed by two men after she told police
they raped her when they learned her true identity.
</P>
<P>
   Swank paid tribute to Teena in her acceptance speech.
</P>
<P>
   ''His legacy lives on through our movie to remind us to always
be ourselves, to follow our hearts, to not conform,'' she said. ''I
pray for the day when we not only accept our differences but we
actually celebrate our diversity.''
</P>
<P>
   Swank, a native of Washington state who grew up wanting to be an
astronaut, was practically an unknown before ''Boys Don't Cry.''
</P>
<P>
   She moved to Los Angeles at age 16 with her newly divorced
mother. Addressing her mother during her acceptance speech she
said, ''It looks like living out of our car was worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   Her previous parts were hardly the stuff of Oscar night. She
debuted in film in ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer.'' On TV she did a
year-long stint on ''Beverly Hills, 90210.''
</P>
<P>
   Her relative anonymity helped her land the ''Boys Don't Cry''
role because director Kimberly Peirce didn't want to cast a star.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Swank became so absorbed in the role she began to
lose touch with her own identity, she has said.

<HEADLINE> 'American Beauty' Wins Five Oscars  </HEADLINE>
By BOB THOMAS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ''American Beauty,'' a dark comedy about
suburban alienation and family dysfunction, won five Academy Awards
Sunday night, including for best picture, first-time director Sam
Mendes and actor Kevin Spacey.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the highlight of my day. I hope it is not all downhill
from here,'' Spacey said jokingly, a racy reference to the film's
opening. It was his second Oscar: He won for best supporting actor
of 1995 for ''The Usual Suspects.''
</P>
<P>
   Alan Ball picked up the Oscar for original screenplay, and
Conrad L. Hall rounded out ''American Beauty's'' awards, for
cinematography. The DreamWorks film had had a leading eight
nominations.
</P>
<P>
   Hilary Swank, who portrayed a woman passing as a man in ''Boys
Don't Cry,'' won as best actress. ''Everyone put their heart and
their soul into this movie,'' Swank said.
</P>
<P>
   She thanked the real-life inspiration for her role, Brandon
Teena, who was murdered. ''His legacy lives on through our movie to
remind us to always be ourselves, to follow our hearts, to not
conform. I pray for the day when we not only accept our differences
but we actually celebrate our diversity,'' Swank said.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Caine, the kindly orphanage headmaster in ''The Cider
House Rules,'' won his second best supporting actor Oscar. ''Cider
House'' also won the adapted screenplay Oscar for John Irving, who
wrote the novel.
</P>
<P>
   Irving offered thanks for recognition of a film that deals with
abortion, and concluded by thanking ''everyone at Planned
Parenthood and the National Abortion Rights League'' -- which got
thunderous applause.
</P>
<P>
   Caine, 67, who previously won as supporting actor for ''Hannah
and Her Sisters'' in 1986, saluted his fellow nominees. ''I'm
basically up here, guys, to represent you as what I hope you will
all be -- a survivor,'' Caine told the star-studded Shrine
Auditorium audience.
</P>
<P>
   Angelina Jolie, the disruptive mental patient in ''Girl,
Interrupted,'' won for supporting actress -- a generation after her
father, Jon Voight, took home an Oscar. The 24-year-old Jolie
thanked her father, a best actor winner for 1978's ''Coming Home''
and a nominee for 1969's ''Midnight Cowboy,'' saying: ''You're a
great actor, but a better father.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The Matrix,'' the story of a computer hacker who discovers
life is a big illusion, won in all four categories in which it was
nominated: film editing, sound, sound effects editing and visual
effects.
</P>
<P>
   Pop star Phil Collins scored the best original song award for
his sentimental ''You'll be in My Heart'' from the animated Disney
film ''Tarzan.'' It was his first win in three nominations.
</P>
<P>
   Collins thanked his three children who, he said, ''really wrote
this song for me.''
</P>
<P>
   The award followed a rousing performance of the bawdy ''Blame
Canada'' from ''South Park: Bigger, Longer &AMP; Uncut.'' Robin
Williams led the chorus in a production number, even though the
show's producers swore there would be none.
</P>
<P>
   Best original score went to John Corigliano for ''The Red
Violin.'' The art direction trophy went to ''Sleepy Hollow.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Topsy-Turvy,'' a drama about the creation of the Gilbert and
Sullivan operetta ''The Mikado,'' won two awards -- for makeup and
costume design.
</P>
<P>
   The live action short award went to ''My Mother Dreams the
Satan's Disciples in New York'' and animated short Oscar went to
''The Old Man and the Sea.'' Documentary honors went to the short
''King Gimp'' and the feature ''One Day in September.''
</P>
<P>
   Spain's ''All About My Mother'' won best foreign film, prompting
one of the night's humorous moments. When director Pedro
Almodovar's acceptance speech began to run long and presenter
Antonio Banderas pretended to pull him off the stage.
</P>
<P>
   ''American Beauty'' topped most critics lists going into the
ceremony, and was named best picture in Friday's controversial Wall
Street Journal poll of 356 of the 5,607 voting Academy members.
</P>
<P>
   Scientific or not, the survey was ''American Beauty's'' clincher
for best buzz going into the Oscar show, broadcast on ABC with
Billy Crystal as host.
</P>
<P>
   The awards show capped one of the most bizarre Oscar seasons.
</P>
<P>
   First, a large number of the ballots were delayed in the mail,
and the academy had to print new ballots. The academy also extended
the voting deadline a few days to last Thursday, meaning the
accountants had to work overtime on awards weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Then a shipment of 55 new Oscar statuettes from the Chicago
manufacturer disappeared from a loading dock at Roadway Express on
March 8. Salvage man Willie Fulgear stumbled across 52 of them
while rummaging through a trash container. Three Oscars remain
missing.
</P>
<P>
   Fulgear, 61, became an instant celebrity. He was given a $50,000
reward by the shipping company and two tickets to Sunday's show.
</P>
<P>
   ''Willie got $50,000 for finding the 52 Oscars. That's not a lot
of money when you realize that Miramax and DreamWorks are spending
millions of dollars just to get one,'' Crystal quipped as he
pointed out the Oscar hero during the program's opening number.
</P>
<P>
   A Roadway Express trucker was charged with stealing the
statuettes.
</P>
<P>
   The academy earlier announced the evening's special awards:
Warren Beatty was named for the Irving Thalberg Award for a high
level of producing, and Andrzej Wajda, premier director of Poland,
won an honorary award ''for showing both the loftiest heights and
the darkest depths of the European soul.''

<HEADLINE> Oscar Night for Beatty, Bening  </HEADLINE>
By LYNN ELBER, AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Warren Beatty and Annette Bening are one of
Hollywood's royal couples, but only one was crowned Sunday at the
Oscars.
</P>
<P>
   Beatty, 63, an actor who also writes, produces and directs,
received the Irving G. Thalberg Award for consistent excellence in
films. His work includes ''Bonnie and Clyde,'' ''Reds,''
''Shampoo'' and ''Bulworth.''
</P>
<P>
   But wife Bening, 41, lost her bid for a best actress trophy for
''American Beauty.'' The Academy Award went to Hilary Swank for
''Boys Don't Cry.''
</P>
<P>
   Another honor that Bening worried might come her way Sunday
didn't materialize: Nine months pregnant with her fourth child, she
had joked about possibly giving birth at the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would be very dramatic, wouldn't it?'' she said beforehand.
</P>
<P>
   The only little bundle she and Beatty welcomed was his
prestigious honor.
</P>
<P>
   It was presented by Jack Nicholson, a close friend who noted
Beatty's 14 nominations and one Oscar and called him the
''handsomest'' Thalberg recipient ever. Beatty won a best directing
trophy for the 1981 film ''Reds.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Due to Ms. Bening's delicate condition and the age of the
recipient, there will be no sex jokes,'' Nicholson said. ''He's a
relentless producer. He's even produced this presentation. He's
seen to it that all of the seat-fillers are board-certified
obstetricians.''
</P>
<P>
   More serious tributes were offered on film by colleagues and
friends including Bening, Julie Christie, Dustin Hoffman and Al
Pacino.
</P>
<P>
   One measure of Beatty's respect in Hollywood: The filmed tribute
even dared to include a clip from an all-time bomb, ''Ishtar,''
which co-starred Hoffman.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's always pushing the boundaries. .... He has enormous
courage,'' said Faye Dunaway, who co-starred with Beatty in
''Bonnie and Clyde.''
</P>
<P>
   A moved Beatty was honored with a standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   ''Although some might say it's a little soon to be giving this
thing to a guy in his early 40s ... it's been very helpful around
the house,'' Beatty joked.
</P>
<P>
   He touched on his other public role, that of political activist
who has toyed with running for president.
</P>
<P>
   ''I must say if you had your choice and you could take the
Thalberg award or the White House, I think I'd stick with this,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   In his long and sometimes rambling speech, Beatty referred --
obliquely -- to his reputation as a ladies' man before settling down
with Bening. He called her and their three children ''what I most
treasure.''
</P>
<P>
   Beatty noted their fourth child ''could join us right here in
the second row if I don't wrap this up.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the drama of the night, including Bening's pregnancy,
his award and her nomination, wouldn't be believable in a film.
</P>
<P>
   ''As a screenwriter, I'd never sit still for it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The ending wasn't entirely happy, but Beatty put it in
perspective during an interview backstage after the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   ''Who could possibly say that Annette is anything other than a
winner?'' he said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Hopes To Revive Mideast Talks  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration says it still hopes
to revive stalled peace talks between Syria and Israel, including
reaching out to Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak for help. But the
failure of President Clinton and Syrian President Hafez Assad to
make progress is casting fresh doubts on the prospects.
</P>
<P>
   ''Significant differences remain and were not narrowed,'' White
House spokesman Joe Lockhart said Sunday, expressing the
administration's disappointment after three hours of talks between
the two presidents in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's Middle East adviser, Dennis Ross, was heading to
Israel today to brief Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak on the
session. The president called Barak before and after the meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had stopped in Geneva on his way home from a 10-day tour
of South Asia hoping that personal diplomacy could produce
something that two months of private negotiations had not: a
breakthrough to permit the talks, stalled since January, to resume.
</P>
<P>
   When the inconclusive meeting ended, Clinton headed quickly for
the airport -- leaving Lockhart behind to face reporters. Had there
been an agreement to announce, the president was expected to make
it himself.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't believe it would be productive'' for Syrian-Israeli
talks to resume at this point, Lockhart said. ''It is impossible to
predict when those talks might resume.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the president understands that the differences that
remain are significant,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Syrian spokesman Jubran Kourieh said that during the talks,
Assad stressed the importance of Syria's longstanding demand for an
Israeli pullback to the country's 1967 borders.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders discussed pending issues and the peace process and
the ''obstacles that Israel has put up and is still putting up,''
Kourieh said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Since yesterday, nothing earth-shattering happened in the
peace process,'' he said. ''At the same time, no one put down any
goals that were not realized.'' He did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   In Jerusalem, Israeli Deputy Defense Minister Ephraim Sneh said
in a telephone interview that the main sticking point in Geneva was
Syria's demand for a prior commitment to cede the strategic Golan
Heights plateau.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fact that Syria insists upon dictating an agreement and
not obtaining an agreed-upon agreement is what made the resumption
of the talks impossible,'' Sneh said. ''They are quite intransigent
about what they are supposed to give in terms of security
arrangements, and they have different ideas about normalization.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to seal his eight-year presidency with a Middle East
peace deal covering the entire region, Clinton has been pressing
hard to arrange a land-for-peace deal between Israel and Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Under the broad outlines, Israel would give up a strategic
border enclave, the Golan Heights, in exchange for a peace treaty
and a normalizing of relations.
</P>
<P>
   Expectations for the Geneva session had been high, partly
because the 69-year-old Assad rarely travels and flew to Geneva
especially to see Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Clinton sees Egypt's Mubarak as perhaps the last best
chance for getting the Israel-Syria peace talks back on track,
administration officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Mubarak, who has been in Washington since Friday, will meet with
Clinton on Tuesday and also plans to confer with Vice President Al
Gore and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are leaders within the region that play an important
role. President Mubarak is clearly one of those,'' White House
spokesman Lockhart said. ''So, I suspect that an important part of
the discussion on Tuesday with President Mubarak would be a
discussion of how we move this process forward.''
</P>
<P>
   After U.S.-brokered talks between Israel and Syria in
Shepherdstown, W.Va., broke down in mid-January, the administration
turned to secret diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   Syria wants Israel to withdraw to its boundaries before the 1967
Six-Day War. That would include patches of land that were within
Israel's international border, but which Syria captured in 1951 --
and would also allow Syria access to the Sea of Galilee, a source
of Israel's precious water supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's Barak has signaled his willingness to surrender at
least some of the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's session was the first full-scale talks between Clinton
and Assad since 1994. The two leaders met at a luxury hotel
overlooking Lake Geneva.

<HEADLINE> Ventura To Seek China Trade Deal  </HEADLINE>
By JONATHAN D. SALANT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura says he is
joining forces with the Clinton administration to push for
permanent normal trade relations with China.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we turn our back on China, rest assured the other nations
throughout the world are not going to turn their back on them,''
Ventura said on ''Fox News Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   Ventura, the Reform Party's highest elected official, said he
would help lobby for the trade bill now pending in Congress. The
legislation would award China permanent normal trade status with
the United States in return for China's agreement to drop trade
barriers that American manufacturers and farmers complain cost them
billions of dollars in lost export sales.
</P>
<P>
   China made the market-opening offers to get U.S. support for its
membership in the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura is scheduled to tout his support of the measure Thursday
when he testifies before the House Ways and Means Committee.
</P>
<P>
   He plans to be active in other forums as well.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been asked by the administration to take a very lead role
on trade of which I'm honored, and I will take that lead,'' Ventura
said. ''I believe in doing what's best for our country, and if I
can help, I'll doggone well do it.
</P>
<P>
   When Ventura was in Washington for a recent National Governors'
Association meeting, he told Clinton he was a strong supporter of
China's entry into the WTO, White House spokesman Jake Siewert said
Sunday. The president said he hoped Ventura would play a visible
role.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously, we appreciate his support and hope he's visible on
this because he speaks for an important and substantial portion of
the American people,'' Siewert said from Geneva, where Clinton met
with Syrian President Hafez Assad.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and the nation's business community strongly support
normal trade relations, while organized labor is just as
steadfastly opposed.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura said labor's position was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ''They better modernize themselves and realize that opening up
China to our trade is going to create more jobs here, because we're
in a position where we're giving up nothing,'' he said. ''Whatever
China is sending here now they'll continue to send here. But what
is happening here is tariffs are going to go down, markets in China
are going to go open up.''

<HEADLINE> Chaplains Long Presence in Congress  </HEADLINE>
By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The chaplains of the House and the Senate are
trustees of one of the oldest traditions in the American
experiment. But even a venerable institution can raise a dust
storm.
</P>
<P>
   Such a storm whipped through the House this winter, propelled by
hotly denied accusations that anti-Catholic bias swayed the
Republican leadership to select a Protestant clergyman as the
chamber's 59th chaplain.
</P>
<P>
   A Roman Catholic priest had been considered the front-runner by
many and the storm burst when he was bypassed.
</P>
<P>
   ''All hell -- perhaps all Hell -- has broken loose,'' columnist
William Safire wrote in The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   There hasn't been anything to match this clamor in all the years
since 1789 when the House and Senate -- following even older
precedents -- started appointing chaplains to pray for divine
guidance.
</P>
<P>
   The fracas was plastered over last week after four months of
partisan acrimony.
</P>
<P>
   The original choice, the Rev. Charles Wright, a Presbyterian
minister, stepped aside. Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., who
accused House Democrats of exploiting the controversy in ''an
unseemly political game,'' quickly appointed the Rev. Daniel
Coughlin, a Catholic priest from Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   When he was sworn in Thursday, Coughlin became the first
Catholic to be named House chaplain. In 211 years, the Senate has
elected a Catholic chaplain just once, in 1832.
</P>
<P>
   The question of a chaplain of one faith praying for legislators
of many religious traditions rose early in American history.
</P>
<P>
   In September 1774, Sam Adams of Massachusetts proposed that each
session of the new Continental Congress be opened with prayer.
</P>
<P>
   Objections were raised, but John Adams, a cousin, responded: ''I
am no bigot. I can hear prayers from a man of piety and virtue, who
is at the same time a friend of his country.''
</P>
<P>
   Some historians say there were political as well as spiritual
motives. John Adams told friends that ''a respectable Anglican
priest'' would be useful to demonstrate the legitimacy of the
Congress and ''to hurl psalm verse at the British.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon afterward, the Rev. Jacob Duche, the Episcopal pastor of
Philadelphia's Christ Church, was opening the Congress with prayer
and pelting the British with scripture.
</P>
<P>
   On July 8, 1776, just days after the Declaration of Independence
was adopted, Duche prayed for divine aid for ''our American states,
who have fled to thee from the rod of the oppressor.''
</P>
<P>
   When the House of Representatives met for the first time in
1789, its members chose the Rev. William Lynn, a Presbyterian, as
their first chaplain. The Senate elected Samuel Provoost, the
Episcopal bishop of New York, who then offered prayers at George
Washington's presidential inaugural.
</P>
<P>
   Chaplains continued their prayerful duties when the government
moved to Washington in 1800.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-four years later, responding to criticism that the
chaplains breached the constitutional wall separating church and
state, the House Judiciary Committee declared them indispensable.
</P>
<P>
   ''If there be a God who hears prayer -- as we believe there is --
we submit there was never a deliberative body that so eminently
needed the righteous prayers of righteous men as the Congress of
the United States,'' the committee observed.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1900s, Senate chaplain Edward Everett Hale, a
Unitarian, was asked whether, in light of the state of the country,
he prayed for the senators. ''No,'' came the famous reply. ''I look
at the senators and pray for the country.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Peter Marshall, perhaps the most famous congressional
chaplain in the 20th century, was profiled in the book and movie,
''A Man Called Peter.'' In opening a prayer in the late 1940s, he
said before senators: ''Forgive us for making so many mountains out
of molehills, and for exaggerating our own importance and the
problems that confront us.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, the late chaplain Richard C. Halverson prayed for
virtually everyone in the extended Senate family: the youthful
pages, the Capitol police, the cafeteria workers, the reporters
taking notes and the people who emptied the trash and cleaned
senators' offices.
</P>
<P>
   And of course he prayed for senators, too. ''Guide them in these
critical hours that they will do nothing that they will later
regret,'' Halverson once said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, after atheists filed a lawsuit contending that the laws
passed by Congress to pay and maintain its chaplains were
unconstitutional, the House voted 388-0 to support the practice of
naming a chaplain as one of its officers.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to Rep. Tom Foley, D-Wash, a co-author of the
save-the-chaplain resolution, Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. told
the House: ''Tom and I are good Catholics and we're prepared to go
to jail to defend our Lutheran chaplain.''
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court made that unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   ''Clearly the men who wrote the ... religion clause did not view
paid legislative chaplains and opening prayers as a violation,''
Chief Justice Warren Burger wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The practice of opening congressional sessions with prayer has
''continued without interruption'' and become ''part of the fabric
of our society,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Gore Plan Would Create House Fund  </HEADLINE>
By SANDRA SOBIERAJ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore is proposing new
campaign finance reforms -- a ''Democracy Endowment'' and strict
disclosure rules -- in his effort to attract John McCain supporters
and inoculate himself against George W. Bush's repeated attacks on
Gore's past fund-raising abuses.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who said he was putting campaign reform front-and-center
in his Democratic presidential race after reform proponents McCain
and Bill Bradley dropped out, planned to unveil his plan at a
campaign appearance today in Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   He was calling for creation of a $7.1 billion endowment to pay
for House and Senate campaigns, new disclosure rules for lobbyists
and outside groups that pay for political ads, and mandatory free
''rebuttal'' air time for candidates targeted by such third-party
ads.
</P>
<P>
   The package is meant to ''break the link between money and
political influence,'' according to a draft of the announcement.
</P>
<P>
   The measures amount to, in equal parts, a drive for
reform-minded independents who had supported McCain in the
Republican primaries and a pre-emptive strike against Texas Gov.
Bush, the presumed GOP nominee who has already made Gore's
fund-raising record a hot campaign issue.
</P>
<P>
   In an excerpt of Gore's speech text provided to The Washington
Post and The New York Times, Gore acknowledges his potential
credibility problem, given fund-raising tactics in 1996 that he has
called ''mistakes.'' They include participation in a fund raiser at
a Buddhist temple and the use of White House telephones in
soliciting campaign cash.
</P>
<P>
   ''I understand the doubts about whether I personally am serious
on campaign reform,'' Gore says in the draft speech. ''And I
understand all too well the irony of our current fund-raising
system. Men and women of good intentions and high ideals want to
protect the public interest but have to raise private money in
order to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Russell Feingold, D-Wis., cosponsor with McCain of major
campaign finance legislation pending before Congress, was expected
to be at the vice president's side for the announcement at
Marquette University.
</P>
<P>
   Gore would pledge to make the long-stalled bill, which bans
unlimited ''soft money'' donations that corporations and labor
unions give to political parties, the first piece of domestic
legislation he submits to Congress as president, a campaign aide
said late Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has long supported the bill, but many Republicans,
including Bush, contend it would unfairly help Democrats because
unions still could spend members' dues money on anti-GOP ads.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore aide, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
so-called Democracy Endowment is designed to function like a
university endowment. Businesses and individuals would receive a
100 percent tax deduction for contributions that would pay for
House and Senate general election campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates receiving funds from the endowment could not accept
money from other sources.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal is consistent with Gore's long support for taxpayer
financing of federal campaigns. Aides projected that a $7.1 billion
fund could be built over seven years, with interest on the
principal generating the money for congressional candidates in the
eighth year.
</P>
<P>
   Another proposal is specifically aimed at an issue that cropped
up with great controversy during Bush's nasty primary fight with
McCain. Two Texas brothers and prominent Bush supporters, Sam and
Charles Wyly, spent some $2.5 million on ads in key states
attacking the Arizona senator's environmental record.
</P>
<P>
   Bush denied any connection with or prior knowledge of the ads.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's proposed new rules would require public identification of
those paying for any political ad that airs within 60 days of
Election Day and, in the case of an organization-paid ad, the names
of the group's financial backers.
</P>
<P>
   Tax-exempt political groups such as the National Abortion and
Reproductive Rights Action League, which already plans a
pro-Democratic ad campaign, would be required to file ''statements
of organization'' disclosing their donor lists.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Gore proposal, lobbyists also would be required to
make monthly disclosures -- posted on the Internet -- of all their
lobbying contacts, what topics they discussed and what political
contributions they made.

<HEADLINE> Diana's bodyguard moves on  </HEADLINE>
By SHARON L. CRENSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- It's easy to like Trevor Rees-Jones, rugby
player, weekend beer-drinker, a guy who seems to make friends
easily and keep them a long time.
</P>
<P>
   The only person to live through the wreck that killed Princess
Diana, he is at last telling his story. Having shunned
million-dollar tabloid offers, he waited more than two years to
publish ''The Bodyguard's Story: Diana, the Crash, and the Sole
Survivor.''
</P>
<P>
   Readers beware: This is not the spicy tell-all of Princess Di's
romance with Egyptian suitor Dodi Fayed.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it is the story of a simple, hardworking man, who took
his job seriously and played hard on his time off, volunteered to
work overtime for a buddy and wound up physically shattered. It is
the story of a few days in the company of the world's most
photographed woman and the frightening tale of how three minutes
can change a family's life.
</P>
<P>
   He remembers nothing after driver Henri Paul, who was legally
drunk, pulled the blue Mercedes carrying Diana, Fayed, and Trevor
away from the Hotel Ritz in Paris and sped toward the tunnel where
three of the four were killed.
</P>
<P>
   There was a time Trevor was desperate to remember, for himself,
for ''the Boss'' (Dodi's father, Egyptian millionaire Mohamed Al
Fayed) and yes, for the world. But he has given up now.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you think about it too much, you think about 'if onlys' and
what could have gone on and what has happened. You know, you go mad
doing that,'' he told The Associated Press in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Now he thinks whatever is locked in his mind about the accident
is destined to stay there, probably because the crash disrupted the
brain activity that would have put the details in long-term memory.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever might come to him now, doctors tell him, would likely
be tainted by all he has read and seen on television about the
early morning hours of Aug. 31, 1997, the morning Diana, Princess
of Wales, died.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only thing I'd put me name by now if I had to stand up in
court would be what I said to the judge on that first meeting in
(the) hospital, from the intensive care,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the book, his answer to the judge's first question
set the tone of the interview:
</P>
<P>
   ''I remember getting into this car, and I do not remember
anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   What is amazing about Trevor's story is his own physical
recovery, and the way his hometown, his mother, stepfather and one
friend in particular sheltered him from the pressure of superrich
Mohammed Al Fayed, the British and French governments and a legion
of media.
</P>
<P>
   When he arrived at the Paris hospital where he would spend the
first few weeks after the accident, he was so seriously disfigured
his mother, Jill, recognized only his legs and rugby-battered ears.
</P>
<P>
   Every bone in his face was broken, the eyes pushed from one to
two inches apart, the jaw dislocated in a way the doctors had never
even read about. Skin flapped freely from his cheek. The nose
pushed flush with the rest of his face.
</P>
<P>
   When the reconstructive surgeon operated, he found ''a landscape
of fractured, free-floating bones and bone debris, of teeth cracked
and skewed crazily from their orderly rows. It was mush.''
</P>
<P>
   And it was happenstance that he wound up at the center of it
all. He was supposed to be off the week leading up to the accident,
but volunteered to take the place of a fellow bodyguard who didn't
want to make the trip with Dodi.
</P>
<P>
   Today some scars remain, but a passerby wouldn't look twice. The
left eyelid is a little bumpy. There's a shallow, jagged line
across the top lip and left cheek. It could be from rugby.
</P>
<P>
   Rubbing his hand across his face, Trevor says it feels a little
like he's wearing a Phantom of the Opera mask. The wrist he broke
in three places gets sore sometimes, and his back stiffens up on
occasion. The long-term worry is arthritis, but other than that,
he's normal.
</P>
<P>
   The dreams have stopped, he's working in security again and just
bought a new two-bedroom Victorian house in his hometown of
Oswestry, England. When strangers show up looking for him,
neighbors run interference until they can call Trevor and figure
out if the visitor is another intrusive reporter.
</P>
<P>
   There's a new girlfriend, too, though he's clearly protective of
her identity. He says he's not even thinking about marriage at this
stage, left gun-shy, perhaps, by the divorce that was already in
process when the accident happened. (His ex-wife sold her story to
the News of the World six months after the crash. ''That didn't
help Trev. He no longer trusted anyone,'' stepfather Ernie Jones
recalls in the book.)
</P>
<P>
   It's still hard to trust.
</P>
<P>
   Mohamed Al Fayed turned on him after Trevor said once and for
all he could not collaborate Fayed's theory that Diana and his son
were the victims of a conspiracy by the British royal family. Then
Al Fayed lashed out at the bodyguards -- both Trevor and Alexander
Wingfield, the other man assigned to protect Dodi and Diana on
their last night.
</P>
<P>
   Wingfield, known by the nickname ''Kez,'' has since left Al
Fayed's operation and helped write ''The Bodyguard's Story.'' He
and Trevor were in New York last week promoting the book together.
They settled somewhat uncomfortably in a posh suite at Le Parker
Meridian hotel in Manhattan, and ran a four-day media blitz, their
only planned publicity.
</P>
<P>
   Trevor described the pampering as ''unnatural'' for the two of
them. Kez said he worried about tidying up before the maid came.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's quite bizarre, really,'' he said with a chuckle.
</P>
<P>
   Both men are hoping the book will put away their part of the
Diana story. But the experience has bound them together. Trevor is
even hoping to hire Kez as part of the security force he's working
on for a new employer.
</P>
<P>
   It's guys like Kez who have kept this well-known, unknown person
sane.
</P>
<P>
   ''People at home, people that matter to me -- that's family, and
Kez, my mates back home -- you know, they knew us before we were
involved in all this,'' Trevor said. ''If you start to get your
feet above your station, they'll soon pull you down.''

<HEADLINE> China, beset by drugs, enlists help from New York rehab program  </HEADLINE>
By LUKAS I. ALPERT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Faced with a flourishing drug trade and an
increasing number of addicts, the People's Republic of China has
been forced to look for new methods to battle drug abuse.
</P>
<P>
   And in a twist in its warming relations with the United States,
the Communist nation's search led it to the capital of capitalism,
New York City, where Daytop Village has gained praise for its drug
and alcohol rehabilitation center.
</P>
<P>
   The addiction problem has forced the normally ideological
Chinese government to become more pragmatic. Monsignor William B.
O'Brien said this was apparent in his first dealings with China's
health officials.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were overwhelmed but honest enough to say, 'We don't know
what to do,'' explained O'Brien.
</P>
<P>
   Since the days of the Communist takeover in 1949, when parts of
China were swamped with opium addicts, the formula for tackling the
drug problem has been much the same: locking up addicts in
military-style camps to break their habit.
</P>
<P>
   But what little statistics are available showed the old ways
didn't work. Chinese authorities report the number of known addicts
has been cut by 23 percent since 1991. But that still left 596,000
registered addicts in 1998, the latest year for which statistics
were available, and independent researchers say the number of
addicts is likely much higher.
</P>
<P>
   China's southernmost province of Yunnan lies along the route
from Southeast Asia's Golden Triangle, a major source of illegal
drugs, and Yunnan has been stung by wrenching economic reforms --
all of which have contributed to a major drug problem.
</P>
<P>
   After traveling within the province, O'Brien said, ''We realized
that the kids we met there were just like the kids we had met in
the United States and were faced with similar problems.
</P>
<P>
   ''People don't realize that China is not so different from here
so families there are really dealing with a lot of the same
problems,'' O'Brien said.
</P>
<P>
   Daytop Village, which operates 25 centers in the United States,
has been instrumental in the development of substance abuse centers
on the world and in training councilors in new approaches to
treatment. China first consulted the organization in 1989 and has
since adapted its programs on a widespread basis.
</P>
<P>
   ''Daytop helped give us direction and a good plan,'' said Yuan
Xiaobo, the executive director of the Yunnan Institute for Drug
Abuse, a center that opened in January under the tutelage of
Daytop.
</P>
<P>
   The center, based in Yunnan's capital of Kunming, is the first
of its kind in China, and health officials hope that it may become
the model for other centers around the country, Yuan said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Daytop has helped train over 500 counselors in
China as well as 11 more in the United States on new approaches to
treatment and prevention of drug abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the boot-camp method previously used, the new Daytop
model stresses addicts taking responsibility and confronting their
feelings. It slowly reintroduces recovering addicts to the outside
world.
</P>
<P>
   The program focuses on a family style atmosphere with a
hierarchical structure.
</P>
<P>
   ''The most important focus of this program is that on the family
structure,'' O'Brien said.
</P>
<P>
   According to Daytop literature, recovering addicts work under
staff supervision to clean their quarters, cook meals and confront
each other when they make mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   Through the structure, the recovering addict learns how to
function drug free and to work and behave on the job.
</P>
<P>
   ''By focusing on the structures of the family, the program helps
those afflicted get the confidence to lead drug free lives,''
O'Brien said.
</P>
<P>
   With the addition of the center in Kunming, Daytop's method has
been used to train counselors in 59 facilities around the world.
</P>
<P>
   And clearly the need is there. Many of those in training at
Daytop's New York center are from countries not thought of as
having major drug problems, such as the Maldives, Indonesia and
Malaysia. But these countries are hit with the problem because they
serve as transit points for narcotics smuggling networks.
</P>
<P>
   Faisal N. Afdhal, who operates a drug treatment facility in
Jakarta, Indonesia, said he was particularly attracted to the
Daytop method because ''the program is not just about stopping
using drugs, but to improve the quality of life.''
</P>
<P>
   Others said that resources in their country often are used for
stopping smuggling but that money for treatment and training is
limited.
</P>
<P>
   ''This will really be helpful for us,'' Abdullah Faseeh of the
Maldives said of the Daytop training. ''As a small country, we
don't have the great universities and many trained people, so
getting a chance like this is a real help.''

<HEADLINE> Peru's Spy Chief Growing Powerful  </HEADLINE>
By MONTE HAYES, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- The government's critics say he's a sinister
genius with a dark past. His defenders say Peruvians owe him
gratitude for his role in neutralizing a leftist insurgency that
threatened Peru's stability.
</P>
<P>
   But all agree on one thing: intelligence chief Vladimiro
Montesinos is growing more powerful. Many believe his power now
exceeds even that of President Alberto Fujimori, who is seeking a
third term in April 9 elections.
</P>
<P>
   ''Montesinos controls the armed forces, the judicial system, the
attorney general's office,'' political scientist Fernando
Rospigliosi contends. ''He has immense power, more than Fujimori.''
</P>
<P>
   Montesinos is the shadow at Fujimori's ear, always close by but
out of the public eye. He is a man who prefers the night, meeting
with the president during the pre-dawn hours. He is accountable to
no one except Fujimori. Many Cabinet members have never met him.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today the true power in Peru is Vladimiro Montesinos, an
absolutely unscrupulous man,'' says Francisco Loayza, a former
member of the intelligence service. Loayza introduced Montesinos to
Fujimori during his first presidential campaign in 1990 and has
written a book about Peru's spy chief called ''The Dark Face of
Power.''
</P>
<P>
   Feared for his extensive network of spies and informants,
Montesinos is the key player in Fujimori's authoritarian regime and
the architect of his re-election drive. Election monitors within
and outside Peru accuse Montesinos' National Intelligence Service
of being behind a dirty tricks campaign to intimidate and discredit
Fujimori's electoral foes.
</P>
<P>
   With Fujimori leading his opponents in public opinion polls and
expected to win a third five-year term, government critics predict
Montesinos' grip on power will tighten.
</P>
<P>
   Peruvians got a glimpse of that power recently when retired army
Cmdr. Francisco Morales Bermudez, who headed a military government
in the 1970s, recalled during a television interview that
Montesinos, then an army captain, had been expelled in disgrace for
forging documents and served a year in prison.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, the army high command issued a scathing communique
attacking Morales Bermudez, who is widely respected for paving the
way for the return of democratic rule. It called him a liar.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori also accused Morales Bermudez of lying, saying he had
political ambitions and wanted to muddy Montesinos' image.
</P>
<P>
   Montesinos, as usual, made no public appearance to defend
himself.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, an indignant Morales Bermudez appeared on
television to show copies of army documents proving Montesinos was
court-martialed and cashiered. He was found guilty of forging
Morales Bermudez's name to a permit that allowed him to make an
unauthorized trip to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ''Montesinos must have tremendous power if the president and the
army come forth to support a man full of dishonor who was punished
by the army itself,'' Morales Bermudez says.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship between Fujimori and Montesinos and the
question of who is more powerful is a frequent topic of
conversation among Peruvians.
</P>
<P>
   Never seen at any public function until a few years ago,
Montesinos of late has taken to appearing at military ceremonies,
where generals pay respect to him as if he, and not Fujimori, were
commander in chief.
</P>
<P>
   Last April, in the only interview he has ever given, the
54-year-old Montesinos appeared with Fujimori in a carefully staged
setting at the headquarters of the National Intelligence Service.
The two wore identical gray suits and checkered ties.
</P>
<P>
   Montesinos took questions from a television reporter, who
admitted later that the intelligence chief had given him the
questions to ask beforehand.
</P>
<P>
   ''Intelligence agents always work in silence,'' Montesinos told
his interviewer, explaining his mysterious ways.
</P>
<P>
   Rospigliosi, the political scientist, says Montesinos has so
much power that ''he is rewriting history, trying to erase his
shameful past.''
</P>
<P>
   After being released from military prison in 1978, Montesinos
became a lawyer for the drug underworld before hooking up with
Fujimori. In 1996, a major drug trafficker accused him of taking
payoffs but later recanted his trial testimony. Montesinos'
intelligence service also has been linked to death squad killings
and torture.
</P>
<P>
   Loayza, the former intelligence agent, says he brought Fujimori
and Montesinos together.
</P>
<P>
   He says outgoing President Alan Garcia ordered the intelligence
service to help Fujimori defeat famed Peruvian novelist Mario
Vargas Llosa for the presidency in 1990 because Garcia feared an
investigation into corruption in his government if Vargas Llosa
won.
</P>
<P>
   The intelligence service learned Vargas Llosa's campaign was
going to accuse Fujimori of tax fraud for having undervalued
several houses that the then lowly paid university president and
his wife, Susana, had built and sold to supplement their income.
</P>
<P>
   Loayza says he knew Montesinos could torpedo the investigation
through his contacts in the judicial system. One night, he took him
to Fujimori's home for a meeting with the candidate. Within three
days, Montesinos had resolved the problem to the delight of the
Fujimoris, Loayza says.
</P>
<P>
   ''Montesinos crept in like gas under the door,'' Loayza recalls.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Susana Higuchi is divorced from Fujimori and running for
Congress on an opposition ticket. Her opinion of Montesinos has
changed.
</P>
<P>
   ''His intelligence serves for evil. He is like a sword of
Damocles over the president,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   In December, a newspaper discovered a bank account in
Montesinos' name with more than $2 million. It said he had received
average monthly deposits of $170,000 from December 1998 to November
1999 from an unknown source. His public salary has never been
revealed.
</P>
<P>
   Montesinos requested an investigation to clear his name, and the
attorney general quickly issued a ruling that there were
insufficient grounds to bring charges of illicit enrichment.
</P>
<P>
   Hernando de Soto, a respected economist who worked closely with
Fujimori in his first term, says it may be difficult to dislodge
Montesinos from power -- even if Fujimori suffers a surprise defeat
in his bid for a third term.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's Peru's most unpopular man and its most accused man,'' de
Soto says. ''They're going to be after him with bloodhounds when
this is over, so, of course, he doesn't want it to be over.''

<HEADLINE> Teen Tells of Attack on Peacekeeper  </HEADLINE>
By DANICA KIRKA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SRBICA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Before he slipped away from police for
a second time, Faton Hajrizi told his father about the day he
killed a peacekeeper in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The 15-year-old admitted he taunted Pvt. Igor Korshunov by
flashing a peace sign at the Russian waiting for his commanding
officer downtown. Faton told his father the soldier began to curse
at him in Serbian -- and then came at him with a handgun in one hand
and a knife in the other.
</P>
<P>
   ''Faton told me, 'I thought he was a Serb,''' Mustafe Hajrizi
said. ''Faton told me he was afraid.''
</P>
<P>
   The teen-ager ended up with Korshunov's machine gun and fatally
shot him.
</P>
<P>
   The 31-year-old Russian was one of 27 peacekeepers to die in
Kosovo since the NATO-led force arrived last June. Most have died
from natural causes, traffic wrecks and accidents clearing
explosives. Thirty-seven more have been seriously injured.
</P>
<P>
   Korshunov was the first to die from a deliberate attack.
Although NATO insists his death March 2 was an isolated incident,
it's a chilling reminder that peacekeepers may not always be
greeted with hugs and roses, that violence is no longer just a
question of revenge between ethnic Albanians and Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   ''Peacekeepers have to be in the middle,'' said a NATO
spokesman, Lt. Commander Philip Anido. ''The tragedy is that
someone is prepared to kill.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the 37,000 peacekeepers here, the Russians are treated
with the most suspicion, in part because stories circulated
throughout the Kosovo war that Russian mercenaries fought alongside
Serb forces during Yugoslavia's 18-month crackdown on ethnic
Albanian militants.
</P>
<P>
   Still they are part of the force that ushered Serb troops out of
Kosovo, and are generally tolerated. Korshunov's death showed how
quickly passions can turn.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am very sorry about what happened,'' Mustafe said, looking
at his wife, Shehrije, for support before dropping his head down
over his knees.
</P>
<P>
   Crimes committed by young people are symptomatic of the many
troubles facing Kosovo as it struggles to rebuild society after the
war and a decade of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's
apartheid-like system.
</P>
<P>
   Every child in Kosovo is traumatized -- either because they lived
through combat or because they were expelled in the refugee exodus,
said Sandra Mitchell of the Organization of Security and
Cooperation in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are all deeply affected. Social structures are just a
fantasy. Combined with that, we have no juvenile justice system in
place,'' she said. ''Kids are committing crimes with absolute
impunity. The system can't cope.''
</P>
<P>
   Faton's father knows this first hand. He said his son was wild
even before the war, the sort of kid who would steal cars only to
leave them at the police station or in the middle of the road. His
rampages earned him the nickname of ''Faton the Thief.''
</P>
<P>
   The war made his rebellion worse. Particularly hard for Faton
was the memory of trying to flee fighting near Srbica, a central
town 25 miles from Pristina, the provincial capital. A bunch of
kids in a horse cart got caught in a skirmish, and were pinned down
for four hours. Faton was shot in the leg.
</P>
<P>
   Concerned that his son was suicidal, Mustafe said he tried
desperately to straighten him out. He said he sought help from the
U.N. police now responsible for Srbica, but they couldn't do
anything either.
</P>
<P>
   Once his son came to him and admitted the killing, he persuaded
Faton to surrender, retrieving the machine gun from a field and
handing it over to authorities. He last saw his son being
handcuffed and driven away.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, Faton escaped from French military custody by
climbing out a bathroom window.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second time Faton eluded arrest. He had been stopped
after Korshunov's killing for an unrelated matter, but was released
by U.N. officers who hadn't yet seen the wanted poster. He was
arrested again Saturday in western Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's a kid. He's 15 years old. He has a sickness,'' Mustafe
said. ''I gave him to their hands to take care of him. I did
everything in my power. Now they are responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   Mustafe said he persuaded Faton to tell police his side of the
story -- that the Russian chased him and that he tried to stay close
to the soldier's truck to prevent the soldier from getting off a
clean shot.
</P>
<P>
   After two circles around it, Faton said he grabbed Korshunov's
machine gun and ran across a square but was cornered. He claimed
the soldier shot first with another weapon.
</P>
<P>
   ''He shot at him twice at the legs,'' Mustafe said. But the
Russian ''didn't stop. Then (Faton) raised the weapon and fired.''
</P>
<P>
   Western investigators say they aren't really sure what happened.
Witnesses have been reluctant to come forward, held back by silence
that shields nearly all suspects here from the police.
</P>
<P>
   But they do say the fatal bullet entered Korshunov's side,
exiting at an angle that investigators say indicates he was shot by
someone standing above him. One scenario being examined, an
investigator said, is that Korshunov was on his knees when he was
shot.
</P>
<P>
   The first police officers at the scene found a crowd standing
nearby.
</P>
<P>
   ''They laughed about it,'' one officer said.

<HEADLINE> 'King Gimp' Wins Best Documentary  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- When ''King Gimp'' was announced the winner
for best documentary short at the Academy Awards Sunday, the
writer, Dan Keplinger, rocked with joy in his wheelchair in the
Shrine Auditorium.
</P>
<P>
   In the film, Keplinger chronicles his battle with cerebral
palsy, from childhood until his early 20s.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have followed Dan Keplinger for 13 years. He's an amazing
spirit in a body that society may not have included,'' Susan Hannah
Hadary, one of the producers, said in accepting the award.
</P>
<P>
   ''But tonight he is included and he's honored as an artist and
we thank the academy for giving him this honor,'' she said, nearly
in tears.
</P>
<P>
   Director and co-producer William A. Whiteford added, ''Dan's
spirit touches us all.''
</P>
<P>
   Thrown over his mother's shoulder or pushed in a wheelchair,
Keplinger goes everywhere and does it all. But he truly enters the
world when he discovers art, a way to communicate his emotions.

<HEADLINE> New particle collider will recreate universe's first moments  </HEADLINE>
By MATT CRENSON, AP National Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   UPTON, N.Y. (AP) -- Deep in the sandy woods of New York's Long
Island, physicists are preparing to travel back to the dawn of the
universe.
</P>
<P>
   In a few weeks their time machine, buried beneath the Department
of Energy's Brookhaven National Laboratory, will begin stripping
gold atoms of their electrons and accelerating them to 99.995
percent of the speed of light. Then it will smash pairs of the
atoms together with such violence that the collisions will generate
temperatures 10,000 times hotter than the sun.
</P>
<P>
   There's no danger. Because the objects involved are
sub-microscopic, the total energy in each collision will be
comparable to that of a mosquito landing on a screen door. But that
energy will be released into a space one-millionth of a millimeter
across, concentrated enough to tear apart an atomic nucleus.
</P>
<P>
   We all learn in school that matter consists of bits called
atoms, and that those atoms are made up of a nucleus of protons and
neutrons surrounded by a swarm of electrons. But in recent decades,
physicists have learned that atoms are more complicated than that.
Inside each nucleus are even smaller particles, called quarks and
gluons, that combine to make protons and neutrons.
</P>
<P>
   Studying how quarks and gluons behave is the frontier of nuclear
physics and may hold the key to understanding how the universe is
put together.
</P>
<P>
   Current theory indicates that the first atoms first appeared
about a second after the universe itself -- so tearing them apart
means re-creating what came before. Physicists picture that realm,
which would have formed just microseconds after the Big Bang, as a
trillion-degree cauldron known as the quark-gluon plasma. Atoms did
not exist. Neither did protons and neutrons.
</P>
<P>
   There were just quarks and gluons, swimming in a superhot brew.
Then, before the universe was a second old, the quark-gluon plasma
congealed into the protons and neutrons that make up atomic nuclei
today.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we hope to do is to make the quark-gluon plasma and then
to actually probe and understand its properties,'' said John
Harris, a Yale University physicist involved in the project.
</P>
<P>
   The quark-gluon plasma's brief moment of glory is lost in the
past, obscured from us by 13 billion years of cosmic evolution. But
if the new particle collider succeeds in recreating the primordial
substance, physicists might learn how it formed, how long it lasted
and how it reconstituted itself into protons and neutrons.
</P>
<P>
   They would have glimpsed the first millisecond of creation.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, physicists say, the universe has gone downhill -- at
least on the temperature scale. As the thermometer dipped below a
trillion degrees, quarks and gluons combined to form protons and
neutrons. Then, when the universe had attained the ripe old age of
one second, protons and neutrons began combining into atoms.
</P>
<P>
   Because we live in such a cold universe compared with the one
that existed 13 billion years ago, the free quarks and gluons won't
hang around long. They will ''freeze out'' into more prosaic
particles in about one million-trillionth of a second.
</P>
<P>
   Physicists compare it to studying water by smashing ice cubes
together in the hope that some of the collisions will produce
enough heat to melt a drop or two.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if you wanted to study those tiny droplets you'd have
to catch them first. The new Brookhaven machine, known as the
Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, has four detectors designed to do
that. Each is packed with electronics that will record everything
about the thousands of particles created in every collision. The
detectors will produce data at the rate of one petabyte a year --
enough to fill the hard disks of 30,000 personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   Going through that data will be quite a task. Part of the
problem is that the plasma can't be seen directly. Physicists will
look for the signs it leaves behind, like trying to prove the
existence of Volkswagens by collecting hubcaps and hood ornaments.
</P>
<P>
   Signs physicists expect to see in the aftermath of a collision
where the quark-gluon plasma is created include a flash of powerful
gamma rays, the production of rare ''strange'' quarks and of
another particle called the upsilon.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists at the CERN laboratory in Europe claim to have seen
some of those signs already, in an experiment that smashed lead
ions into stationary targets of lead and gold.
</P>
<P>
   ''We now have evidence of a new state of matter where quarks and
gluons are not confined,'' CERN laboratory director Luciano Maiani
said in a statement released in February.
</P>
<P>
   But it will take Brookhaven's new machine, 10 times more
powerful than the CERN experiment, to demonstrate beyond a doubt
that the plasma exists.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to simulating the early universe, the $600 million
collider will help physicists learn how atomic nuclei are put
together the same way kids figure out how their toys work -- by
taking them apart.
</P>
<P>
   Physicists already know, for example, that two up quarks and a
down quark make a proton, and two down quarks and an up quark make
a neutron. But they do not understand completely how those quarks
and the gluons are arranged.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not just Tinkertoys where you take these rocks and tie
them together with sticks,'' said Robert Jaffe, a Massachusetts
Institute of Technology physicist who works on RHIC.
</P>
<P>
   After about two years, the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider --
RHIC for short -- will supplement its experimental repertoire by
substituting individual protons for gold ions about one-third of
the time. By that time the experiment will have consumed only a
tiny fraction of a gram of gold.
</P>
<P>
   The proton-proton collisions will investigate a property known
as spin -- the rotation of a particle around its axis. The proton's
spin has been measured extremely accurately, and so has the
quark's.
</P>
<P>
   But add up the spins of the three quarks in a proton, and they
account for less than half of the larger particle's spin. Where
does the rest of the proton's spin come from?
</P>
<P>
   There are two possibilities. Some could come from the gluons,
the particles that stick the quarks together to form a proton. Some
could also come from quarks and gluons as they spin around each
other the way orbiting planets contribute to the solar system's
angular momentum.
</P>
<P>
   ''The bad news is that nobody knows a reliable way to measure
the orbital angular momentum,'' Jaffe said.
</P>
<P>
   But the good news is that RHIC can measure the spin contribution
of the gluons.
</P>
<P>
   Physicists will try to figure that out by colliding a beam of
protons spinning in one direction with a second spinning the
opposite way. RHIC is the first collider that can collide two
oppositely spinning proton beams.
</P>
<P>
   As with the quark-gluon plasma experiments, the trick is to
examine the debris flying out of those collisions and then use them
to turn the clock back -- in this case to the moment just before the
collision happened.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think we're in great shape to make discoveries because we
have this new tool,'' said Brookhaven physicist Mike Tannenbaum.
</P>
<P>
   What if RHIC fails to measure the components of the proton's
spin, or can't re-create the plasma? What if it does make the
plasma, but the stuff turns out to be completely different from
what they expected?
</P>
<P>
   Physicists will be delighted.
</P>
<P>
   Nuclear physics is built on a theory known as quantum
chromodynamics. Ever since it was developed in the 1960s the theory
has been predicting the outcomes of experiments with incredible
precision. As proud as they are of it, physicists can't wait for
the day when they find some hole, some special circumstance where
their theory fails completely.
</P>
<P>
   The last time something like that happened, early in the 20th
century, relativity and quantum dynamics came to the rescue. The
new ideas revolutionized physics and made things like computers,
lasers and nuclear weapons possible. So physicists actually welcome
things they don't understand.
</P>
<P>
   ''Finding and nailing the plasma would be fantastic,'' said
William Zajc, a RHIC physicist and Columbia University professor.
''The only thing more fantastic would be some totally unexpected
surprise that defies our predictions.''

<HEADLINE> Kingdome Imploded in Seattle  </HEADLINE>
By LAURENCE M. CRUZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- One minute the Kingdome was there, all 100,000
hulking tons of it.
</P>
<P>
   Then it was gone.
</P>
<P>
   Sparks flickered across the roof as 21.6 miles of demolition
cord exploded, setting off a series of blasts that knocked down the
support posts and collapsed the dome.
</P>
<P>
   The 25,000-ton roof settled tidily onto the ground Sunday like a
doily -- distinctive ribs still visible -- as dust from the blast
blew north.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a shame. It was good-looking building,'' said Steve
Albert, 46, of Seattle, who watched from nearby Pike Place Market.
''It didn't seem that old as buildings went. It's a waste.''
</P>
<P>
   It took 16.8 seconds to implode the 24-year-old Kingdome, which
brought professional football and baseball to Seattle. The
demolition makes room for a new $430 million football-soccer
stadium just south of the Seattle Mariners' brand-new $517 million
arena in Pioneer Square.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of people gathered to watch from hillsides, in
office-tower parties, and in boats of all description bobbing off
the downtown waterfront.
</P>
<P>
   ''It just happened so fast. Everyone started clapping. They were
just gasping and yelling and clapping,'' said Susan Clark, one of
about 130 people who watched the implosion at a $250-a-head
fundraiser from the 11th floor of a nearby building.
</P>
<P>
   Vibration from the collapse -- gauged by seismic experts from the
University of Washington and the U.S. Geological Survey -- was less
than expected and well below allowable limits, said Maryland-based
Controlled Demolition Inc.'s Mark Loizeau.
</P>
<P>
   Some windows in nearby buildings -- draped in fabric to protect
them -- were shattered by the concussion as 68 million cubic feet of
air inside the dome was displaced.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm going to miss the Kingdome,'' said John Abrams, 17, a
student at Central Valley High in Spokane who traveled about 300
miles to see it come down. ''When people thought of Seattle they
thought of the Space Needle and the Kingdome.''
</P>
<P>
   A third of the debris will be used to build the Seattle
Seahawks' new football stadium and the rest will be sold as raw
materiel for construction, said project spokesman Pete Pedersen.
</P>
<P>
   The dome, built on the cheap in 1976 for $67 million, underwent
$70 million in roof repairs in 1994 and millions in assorted
enhancement projects -- and still isn't paid for.
</P>
<P>
   The dome was a necessity in the Rainy City, but fans complained
that the concrete stadium was too small for football and not
intimate enough for baseball.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, it leaked. And in 1994, four 15-pound ceiling tiles
crashed into the stands just hours before a Mariners' game.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many mourned its loss.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the magic dust of heroes,'' said Philip Courier as he
scraped fine, gray dust from the windscreen of a car into a small,
clear plastic box.

   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A Wall Street Journal survey that angered the
Motion Picture Academy by polling voters correctly predicted all
but one of the top Oscar winners.
</P>
<P>
   The Journal narrowly picked Denzel Washington in ''The
Hurricane'' for best actor, but Kevin Spacey took the Oscar Sunday
for ''American Beauty.'' The Journal accurately predicted
''American Beauty'' for best picture, Hilary Swank for best
actress, Sam Mendes for best director, Michael Caine for best
supporting actor, and Angelina Jolie for best supporting actress.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper predicted winners after polling 356 of 5,607
voting members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.
Many of the voters polled asked to remain anonymous, but several
openly discussed their picks.
</P>
<P>
   The Academy urged its members not to cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   Amy Stevens, entertainment editor of the Weekend Journal, said
the survey was simply a way to explore the voting process for
readers. ''We make no claims to scientific accuracy,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Rwanda Rulers Eliminate Opposition  </HEADLINE>
By HRVOJE HRANJSKI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) -- Political assassinations, army desertions
and a growing opposition pose the latest challenge to Rwanda, where
the behind-the-scenes rulers have again showed they are not yet
ready to tolerate dissent for fear of letting the country slip into
turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   President Pasteur Bizimungu's recent resignation was only the
latest in a long line of departures of both Hutu and Tutsi
politicians who have voiced opposition to the power in Rwanda being
concentrated in the hands of a select few.
</P>
<P>
   The handful of young military leaders who run the country --
impoverished and traumatized by the 1994 genocide that left more
than 500,000 Tutsis and politically moderate Hutus dead -- follow a
Spartan discipline and are committed to national reconciliation and
free-market economics, but not to outright democracy.
</P>
<P>
   The government is struggling to build a consensus among bitter
Tutsi genocide survivors, the majority Hutu population -- who
largely feel ostracized -- and almost a million Tutsi returnees who
spent more than 30 years in exile in Uganda, Burundi, Tanzania and
Congo. The diaspora returned with different languages, mentalities
and social customs.
</P>
<P>
   Security -- established only recently after years of Hutu rebel
attacks -- has given rise to a political opposition, coming
unexpectedly from the Tutsi genocide survivors who feel excluded
from power by the Tutsi returnees and the Hutu business elite, some
of whom have links to extremists responsible for the genocide.
</P>
<P>
   The genocide survivors want a complete break with Hutu political
parties in the government and parliament, swift justice for 125,000
jailed genocide suspects, including public executions, an apology
and financial compensation.
</P>
<P>
   But the inner circle of Maj. Gen. Paul Kagame -- the former rebel
commander, vice president, minister of defense, and undisputed No.
1 politician in Rwanda -- has not tolerated such demands.
</P>
<P>
   Kagame led the Tutsi-dominated Rwandan Patriotic Front from the
refugee camps where they grew up in neighboring Uganda to eventual
victory over the former government in July 1994. His troops stopped
the 100-day genocide orchestrated by the former extremist Hutu
government.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the RPF officially shares power with a half-dozen
other political parties, Kagame now has the real authority.
</P>
<P>
   Supported by the United States and other Western governments,
the RPF has been running a social laboratory, carefully balancing
the different groups vying for power. Yet critics say the RPF has
either tried to silence opponents or send them into exile.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Sebarenzi Kabuye, a popular Tutsi and former speaker of
the National Assembly, fled in January after he was accused of
planning the return of the exiled Tutsi monarch to challenge
Kagame.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, another prominent survivor and presidential adviser,
Assiel Kabera, was gunned down in front of his house in downtown
Kigali, apparently by men in uniform. No arrests have been made.
</P>
<P>
   The government has been equally harsh with its Hutu opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, parliament became the weapon for attacking ministers
and legislators suspected of graft and mismanagement. The first to
go were three Hutu ministers and former Prime Minister
Pierre-Celestin Rwigema, also a Hutu, who resigned on Feb. 28 on
charges of corruption.
</P>
<P>
   All were political survivors of the late Hutu President Juvenal
Habyarimana's government.
</P>
<P>
   Bizimungu, a 49-year-old Hutu technocrat who made a personal
fortune before he fell out with Habyarimana in 1990, accused
parliament of selectively going after Hutus -- an explosive
allegation in the country where ethnicity is often used as a
political tool.
</P>
<P>
   But his speech attracted little sympathy and only exposed him to
allegations that he was trying to hinder an anti-graft campaign
that RPF leaders promised would spare no one, Hutus or Tutsis. The
allegations led to his resignation, but again demonstrated the
RPF's intolerance of dissent .

<HEADLINE> Court To Tackle Hate Crime Dispute  </HEADLINE>
By MELANIE BURNEY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) -- Charles Apprendi Jr. says he was high on
alcohol and drugs -- not filled with racial hatred -- when he fired
shots into the home of a black family in his predominantly white
neighborhood in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was just criminal mischief. That's all it was. I had no
idea it was a black family's home,'' he insists.
</P>
<P>
   A judge saw it differently. He determined that Apprendi's
actions were motivated by prejudice and imposed a longer prison
term under New Jersey's hate crimes law, one of the first adopted
in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Apprendi, 47, is challenging his sentence in a case to be argued
before the U.S. Supreme Court this week. His lawyers argue that a
jury, using the most stringent burden of proof, should have
determined whether the crime was motivated by bias and warranted
the additional penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our question is how and to whom do you prove it,'' said
Richard Singer, a professor at Rutgers-Camden Law School assisting
in the appeal. ''Our argument is that anything that dramatically
affects the sentence should be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers has called
the case one of the most important to be decided this session by
the court. Oral arguments were scheduled for Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   While the appeal does not directly challenge New Jersey's Hate
Crimes Act, which was upheld by the state Supreme Court in 1994, it
could have far-reaching implications on judges' power to mete out
punishment.
</P>
<P>
   As it stands now, a judge can add years to a sentence based on a
''preponderance of evidence.'' Apprendi's lawyers will argue that
the hate-crime issue should have been treated as an element of the
offense and decided by a jury using the highest legal standard --
whether prosecutors had proved racial bias beyond a reasonable
doubt.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will have the potential of restricting the freedom of a
judge to sentence more harshly,'' said criminal defense lawyer Carl
Poplar.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey was one of the first states to adopt a hate crime
law, in 1981. It bans acts of racial or ethnic intimidation, such
as burning crosses or painting swastikas. The law was expanded in
1990 to provide stiffer penalties for such common crimes as assault
and harassment if prejudice played a part in selecting the victim.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all states now have similar laws that provide for extra
punishment when crime victims are targeted because of their race,
religion or sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   Apprendi's 12-year sentence is about three years longer because
of the racial bias finding. He has served about one-third of his
sentence and is now in a halfway house. His case was expected to go
before a state parole board in May.
</P>
<P>
   Apprendi admitted he fired four or five shots into the house in
Vineland, telling police he wanted to give the family who lived
there a message that they did not belong in his neighborhood. No
one was injured.
</P>
<P>
   But Apprendi later said he was unfairly pressured into giving
police a false statement, and that his gunfire really had been
randomly directed when the house's purple front door caught his
eye.
</P>
<P>
   ''In a rational state of mind and unimpaired I would have never
thought of shooting in someone's house,'' Apprendi said during a
recent interview.
</P>
<P>
   He pleaded guilty to a firearms violation and possessing a bomb
in his house, all of which carried a maximum 10-year prison
sentence. At a plea hearing, he admitted his purpose for shooting
at the house was to frighten the family.
</P>
<P>
   After prosecutors sought a stiffened sentence under the hate
crimes law, the trial judge imposed the 12-year term, saying
prosecutors had offered persuasive evidence that Apprendi's act was
racially motivated.
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey Supreme Court upheld his sentence by a 5-2 vote
last June. The court determined that the law does not violate
constitutional rights, saying it clearly requires proof of a bias
crime.

<HEADLINE> Oscars Have Family Ties  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Sunday's Oscar ceremony added to
a brief, but
notable list of parent-child honorees.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Angelina Jolie's win for best supporting actress for her role in
''Girl, Interrupted'' came 21 years after father Jon Voight was
awarded best actor for ''Coming Home.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Oscar family ties over the years include:
</P>
<P>
   -- Michael Douglas won an Academy Award for producing the 1975
best picture ''One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest'' and also for best
actor in 1987 for ''Wall Street.'' Father Kirk Douglas won an
honorary Oscar in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   -- Jane Fonda won best actress for her role in ''Klute'' in 1971
and again in 1978 for ''Coming Home.'' Father Henry Fonda received
an honorary Oscar in 1980 and a best actor award for ''On Golden
Pond'' in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   -- Vincente Minnelli won best director for ''Gigi'' in 1958. In
1972, daughter Liza Minnelli won best actress for ''Cabaret.''
</P>
<P>
   -- The Oscar has been in Hollywood's Huston family for three
generations. John Huston won for directing the 1948 classic ''The
Treasure of the Sierra Madre,'' and father Walter won for
supporting actor in the same film. In 1985, John Huston directed
daughter Angelica to a best supporting actress award in ''Prizzi's
Honor.''

<HEADLINE> 'American Beauty' Wins Five Oscars  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GERMAIN, AP Entertainment Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- When ''American Beauty'' hit theaters last
fall, many were surprised when it became a box-office hit and an
Oscar front-runner.
</P>
<P>
   By Sunday night, though, it came as no surprise that the
sobering satire of suburbia dominated the Academy Awards. In an
industry whose recent top honors have mostly gone to splashy epics,
''American Beauty'' had simply built up too much critical and
popular esteem to be denied.
</P>
<P>
   The film won five awards: best picture, best actor for Kevin
Spacey, best director for Sam Mendes, best original screenplay for
Alan Ball and best cinematography for Conrad L. Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Might the success of the dark yet wildly absurd ''American
Beauty'' herald Hollywood's return to such thoughtful,
character-driven films as ''Midnight Cowboy'' and ''One Flew Over
the Cuckoo's Nest,'' both best-picture winners?
</P>
<P>
   First-time director Mendes, steeped in such films growing up,
hopes so.
</P>
<P>
   ''The more of these sorts of movies that get made and the more
they get acknowledged by the mainstream, the better,'' said Mendes,
an acclaimed theater director.
</P>
<P>
   Spacey, whose character undergoes a transformation after almost
consummating an affair with his daughter's high-school friend, said
the movie hit home with audiences because ''we got to see all of
his worst qualities, and we still grew to love him.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We get a chance to see characters have experiences that make
us feel that we're not the only ones who have those feelings,''
said Spacey. ''We sort of have a collective admission when we see
characters do those things that we do.''
</P>
<P>
   The best-picture win was sweet revenge for ''American Beauty''
distributor DreamWorks, the studio co-founded by Steven Spielberg,
whose ''Saving Private Ryan'' lost best-picture honors last year to
Disney-owned Miramax's ''Shakespeare in Love.''
</P>
<P>
   Spielberg, who won for best director last year for ''Saving
Private Ryan,'' presented the director's award to Mendes. It was
the first best-picture win for DreamWorks, founded five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The evening was not a sweep for ''American Beauty.'' Hilary
Swank, a virtual unknown, won the best actress award for another
dark film, ''Boys Don't Cry,'' based on the true story of Brandon
Teena, a woman who lived as a man and was killed when her true
gender was uncovered.
</P>
<P>
   ''I consider myself someone who cares a huge amount about
humanity and I think that this movie opens the door to letting
people know what goes on in society and hopefully putting an end to
intolerance in the future,'' Swank said.
</P>
<P>
   Other top winners included Angelina Jolie for best supporting
actress for her turn as a hospitalized sociopath in ''Girl,
Interrupted.'' Michael Caine won his second best supporting actor
award for his role as an ether-sniffing abortionist who runs an
orphanage in ''The Cider House Rules.''
</P>
<P>
   John Irving won for best adapted screenplay for the script of
his novel ''The Cider House Rules.''
</P>
<P>
   Phil Collins took the Oscar for original song for ''You'll Be in
My Heart'' from ''Tarzan.'' Pedro Almodovar's ''All About My
Mother'' won for foreign-language film.
</P>
<P>
   The glitzy sci-fi thriller ''The Matrix'' won in all four
categories for which it was nominated -- visual effects, film
editing, sound and sound-effects editing.
</P>
<P>
   Caustic and kooky, ''American Beauty'' was a seriocomic tale of
suburban lunacy that ran counter to big-picture epics such as
''Titanic,'' ''Schindler's List,'' ''Braveheart'' and ''The English
Patient'' that have dominated the Oscars.
</P>
<P>
   The Oscars have occasionally gone dark and disturbing in recent
years. In 1991, the serial-killer flick ''The Silence of the
Lambs'' was an atypical winner, while Clint Eastwood's anti-hero
western ''Unforgiven'' took top honors the next year.
</P>
<P>
   Shot for $15 million, ''American Beauty'' has gone on to top
$108 million at the box office while playing in barely half as many
theaters as many top Hollywood movies.
</P>
<P>
   The movie, however, had all the quirks, tics and warts that
should have relegated it to the list of critics' darlings and
modest box-office successes.
</P>
<P>
   Consider its characters: A middle-aged chump who lusts after his
daughter's friend; a shrill wife empowered by her pistol and her
farcical fling with the local real-estate king; a homophobic Marine
colonel who tests his son's urine for drugs; and a teen-age video
voyeur who peddles pot and philosophizes about a plastic bag
dancing in the wind.
</P>
<P>
   Screenwriter Ball said ''American Beauty's'' triumph taught him
to ''write what moves you.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The lesson I've learned out of this is really follow your
heart and follow your passion, and follow your guts and just sit
down and write it,'' Ball said.

<HEADLINE> Academy Awards Fashion Played Safe  </HEADLINE>
By MARY MacVEAN, 
For The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Most celebrities at this year's Academy
Awards kept any outrageous fashion impulses locked in the closet.
</P>
<P>
   The audience at the Shrine Auditorium on Sunday was awash in
sophisticated gowns and sober tuxedos, reflecting old Hollywood
more than bold daring.
</P>
<P>
   Even Cher came down with a case of class, leaving her trademark
beaded, see-through numbers and towering headdresses at home. The
actress arrived on stage in a modest black gown to present an
award.
</P>
<P>
   ''You probably noticed already that I am dressed like a grownup.
No, no, I wish to apologize to the Academy, and I promise that I
will never do it again,'' she joked.
</P>
<P>
   The guys from ''South Park'' didn't disappoint, however.
</P>
<P>
   Trey Parker, co-nominated with Marc Shaiman for the best song
Oscar for ''Blame Canada,'' wore a copy of the almost wide-open
concoction Jennifer Lopez wore to the Grammys last month. Matt
Stone donned a knockoff of the pink dress Gwyneth Paltrow wore last
year. And Shaiman's white leisure suit was accented by a blue
fedora and blue fur stole.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everyone just looks fabulous,'' said Stone, whose accessories
included a cigarette behind one ear.
</P>
<P>
   Oscar winner Angelina Jolie looked like Morticia Addams in a
black, long-sleeved dress with a train and waist-length black hair.
Drew Barrymore was completely herself in a black knit dress low
enough in back to show off her below-waist angel tattoo.
</P>
<P>
   But most celebrities played it safe this year and covered up.
</P>
<P>
   Actress Charlize Theron epitomized old Hollywood in a tangerine
form-fitting V-neck halter by Vera Wang. Hilary Swank appeared in a
strapless bronze gown, Uma Thurman in a red chiffon pleated dress.
</P>
<P>
   Pregnancy didn't get in the way of fashion for Oscar nominee
Annette Bening. The nine-months-pregnant star of ''American
Beauty'' was decked out in a black, multi-layered, beaded tulle
gown with sheer black tulle and rhinestone wrap by Giorgio Armani.
</P>
<P>
   Lucy Liu moved closer to daring in a racy red hand-beaded
Versace dress with lots of see-through. It was, she said, the only
dress she tried on.
</P>
<P>
   Others, such as Salma Hayek, Tyra Banks and Ashley Judd caught
spring fever and chose a palette of pastels.
</P>
<P>
   Nicole Kidman wore gold, which unfortunately came out looking
more like mustard on TV.
</P>
<P>
   Faith Hill's deep V-necked, body-hugging silver Versace gown
appeared to be made of hundreds of tiny silver metal rectangles.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very easy to wear,'' she gushed.
</P>
<P>
   Actress Chloe Sevigny wore a Yves St. Laurent black halter dress
with a deep V-neck, chosen, she said, for its comfort.
</P>
<P>
   Men, too, mostly opted for traditional styles, though actor
Samuel Jackson wore a long, deep purple jacket, black shirt and
purple tie. For the young men of Hollywood, Keanu Reeves among
them, a black shirt and tie was trendy.
</P>
<P>
   Blame the blandness on professional Hollywood; the Oscars show
has also become biggest fashion show of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Platoons of designers, stylists, makeup artists, jewelers,
agents, publicists and assistants invade the city's swankiest
hotels weeks ahead of time to pitch their wares to the stars and
the professionals who dress them.
</P>
<P>
   Awards night is a ''merchandising mecca,'' diminishing displays
of individual taste, said designer Randolph Duke.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wish it was still the days of the woman and the designer,''
Duke said before the show.
</P>
<P>
   Now the dress is decided by committee, he said, leading to
nothing awful, nothing outrageous and nothing really stunning; just
something that looks nice.
</P>
<P>
   ''And nice isn't good enough for the Oscars,'' Duke said.

<HEADLINE> Oscarcast: Big, Long and Uncut  </HEADLINE>
By FRAZIER MOORE, AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Inflation continues to plague the Oscarcast.
</P>
<P>
   ''The 72nd Annual Academy Awards,'' which ABC aired live from
Los Angeles' Shrine Auditorium Sunday night, ran a record-long four
hours, eight minutes, by unofficial count, beating the four hours,
five minutes of last year's Oscarcast.
</P>
<P>
   What happened to those pledges that the so-called ''2000
Oscars'' show would be shorter, not longer? And who among us
believed them?
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the program was sleek, classy and as carefully engineered
as Julia Roberts' new cleavage. So, with everything apparently on
automatic pilot, why can't the show come in on time?
</P>
<P>
   Nothing in particular gummed up the works, although no viewer
would have missed the Burt Bacharach-led medley of past
Oscar-winning songs.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Crystal did his usual smooth job as host (his seventh
turn), and seemed to pop up more often than in past Oscarcasts. His
jovial wisecracks were usefully interlaced through the evening,
enlivening the clackety-clack efficiency of the business at hand.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, he stole the first half-hour, which remained the
show's high point.
</P>
<P>
   For his signature prepared sequence, Crystal was digitally
inserted into a series of classic films. At one point he sought
counsel from Don Corleone in ''The Godfather.'' At another, he sang
the lead in a number from ''West Side Story'': ''Tonight, tonight,
there'll be no dance tonight, and yet this show will still run too
long.''
</P>
<P>
   (Can't say we weren't warned.)
</P>
<P>
   Then came musical tributes to Oscar nominees. Crystal filched
the tune of ''Mame'' to serenade supporting actor contender Michael
Caine: ''How many movies can one actor make? Caine! He'll make one
in the next station break! Caine!''
</P>
<P>
   Later, when Caine was named winner for his performance in ''The
Cider House Rules,'' he offered perhaps the night's standout
acceptance remarks.
</P>
<P>
   The veteran actor not only humbly, graciously saluted his
co-nominees, but, as the grand old man in this circle, he
effectively blessed each of them. It was a moment striking in its
purity.
</P>
<P>
   One smart innovation from producers Richard Zanuck and Lili Fini
Zanuck: The five nominated songs were polished off deftly, back to
back. These culminated with Robin Williams delivering the saucy
''Blame Canada'' (from ''South Park: Bigger, Longer &AMP; Uncut''),
complete with a kickline of leggy female ''Canadian Mounties.''
</P>
<P>
   The stage setting for the Oscarcast was handsome, with pillars
that could display graphic information, a flashing disco-like floor
(borrowed, Crystal joked, from ''Soul Train''), and a video wall in
the background that accommodated multiple images like a computer
desktop.
</P>
<P>
   Prime topics of mirth for the evening: those 55 waylaid Oscar
statuettes recovered by Willie Fulgear, the world's most famous
junk man, and the imminent labor of pregnant best-actress nominee
Annette Bening.
</P>
<P>
   But during the long, long evening, viewers saw nothing
embarrassing, silly or untoward to chortle about the next day.
</P>
<P>
   Presenters read their scripted lines and got off. Winners
expressed their grateful, not too extravagant thank-yous, and got
off.
</P>
<P>
   Behind his dark glasses, Jack Nicholson, introducing Irving G.
Thalberg Award-winner Warren Beatty, seemed more doddering than
rascally.
</P>
<P>
   Even Cher, a presenter, conceded she had come dressed like a
grown-up -- which, disappointingly, she had. She promised it
wouldn't happen again. But on the Oscarcast, promises have a way of
being broken.

<HEADLINE> Vignettes From 72nd Academy Awards  </HEADLINE>
By ANTHONY BREZNICAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   The award for most gracious Oscar winner goes to -- Michael
Caine.
</P>
<P>
   The two-time winner for best supporting actor talked more about
his fellow nominees during his acceptance speech than himself.
</P>
<P>
   And he broke up fellow nominee Tom Cruise when he remarked: ''If
you had won this your price would have gone down so fast. Have you
any idea what supporting actors get paid?''
</P>
<P>
   Caine, who won for ''The Cider House Rules,'' said any of his
fellow nominees, Cruise, Haley Joel Osment, Michael Clark Duncan or
Jude Law, could have taken home the award.
</P>
<P>
   He had the inside track, he quipped, because at age 67 he is
older than any of them.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm a survivor. That's what it is. That's what they gave it to
me for. I'm still here after all these years,'' said Caine, who won
his first best-supporting Oscar for ''Hannah and Her Sisters'' in
1986.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   As director Pedro Almodovar strode to the stage to collect his
best foreign film Oscar, presenters Penelope Cruz and Antonio
Banderas engaged in a spirited back-and-fourth exchange with his
Oscar, each offering the other the opportunity to hand it to him.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprising. His films have helped make stars of both.
</P>
<P>
   When he wouldn't get off the stage, however, it fell upon
Banderas, who got his start in such Almodovar films as ''What Have
I Done To Deserve This?'' ''Women on the Verge of a Nervous
Breakdown'' and ''Tie Me Up, Tie Me Down'' to try to give him the
hook.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let me know when you're done, I'm just here,'' joked host
Billy Crystal as Banderas playfully tugged at Almodovar while the
director continued to thank people connected with his movie ''All
About My Mother.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   Shock comic Tom Green, arriving for the Oscars on the arm of his
girlfriend, Drew Barrymore, sought to make it clear that his recent
announcement about undergoing surgery to remove a cancerous
testicle wasn't one of his elaborate MTV pranks.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wish I were joking,'' he said, adding that this is the most
anyone has asked him about his private parts.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll have to talk about it on the show more,'' he quipped.
</P>
<P>
   Green said he made a point of coming to the Oscars so soon after
surgery to show everyone he was all right.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   Cher was looking subdued in basic black and sounding apologetic
with tongue firmly in cheek.

   When the actress came on stage to present an award Sunday night,
her simple, strapless black gown failed to live up to the
outrageous beaded, skin-bearing, see-through things of Oscar past.
</P>
<P>
   ''You've probably noticed already that I'm dressed like a
grown-up,'' quipped the actress who won the best actress Oscar for
''Moonstruck'' in 1988 and accepted the award that year in a dress
covered with see-through netting.
</P>
<P>
   ''I apologized to the Academy and I promise that I will never do
it again,'' she said of this year's dress.

   The Oscar bandits weren't about to get a second chance.
</P>
<P>
   The dozens of Academy Awards statuettes that junkman Willie
Fulgear rescued from the trash last week arrived at Sunday night's
awards ceremony in a van surrounded by armed guards.
</P>
<P>
   ''We weren't going to risk anything at this point,'' said Ric
Robertson, the Academy's executive administrator. He was vague
about just how many extra guards he employed.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's Oscars were a mixture of the ones that were stolen and
then recovered, and replacements that were quickly ordered after
the first batch disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't clear which winners would be going home with the ones
Fulgear pulled from the trash.

<HEADLINE> 'Erin Brockovich' Leads Box Office  </HEADLINE>
By MICHELLE DeARMOND, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- With Hollywood's eyes on a guy named Oscar, a
gal named ''Erin Brockovich'' quietly captured the top box office
spot for the second week in a row.
</P>
<P>
   The legal drama starring Julia Roberts grossed an estimated $19
million for the weekend, closely followed by the newly released
action film ''Romeo Must Die'' with $18.6 million, according to
studio estimates released Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Academy Award-winning films ''American Beauty'' and ''The Cider
House Rules'' benefitted from an ''Oscar bounce'' as moviegoers
rushed to see the films before Sunday's annual Academy Awards
ceremony, said Paul Dergarabedian, president of Exhibitor Relations
Co. Inc., which tracks movie attendance.
</P>
<P>
   ''American Beauty'' pulled in $3.9 million in the No. 7 spot,
bringing its cumulative earnings to $108.4 million. ''Cider House''
grossed an estimated $2.8 million in ninth for a cumulative gross
of $49.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   ''American Beauty'' dominated the Oscars, taking the best
picture award. The film's star, Kevin Spacey, won for best actor
and Sam Mendes won best director. ''Beauty'' also won for original
screenplay and for cinematography.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Caine, the kindly orphanage headmaster in ''The Cider
House Rules,'' won an Oscar for best supporting actor. The film
also earned the best adapted screenplay Oscar for John Irving.
</P>
<P>
   ''Erin Brockovich'' is based on the real-life story of a
California woman who took a clerical job with a legal firm and
uncovered a pollution scandal involving Pacific Gas &AMP; Electric Co.
Brockovich led a crusade for 650 residents whose water was
contaminated by the utility and won a $333 million settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a film that certainly is benefitting from great word of
mouth,'' Dergarabedian said. ''There's no question this is a crowd
pleaser.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Erin Brockovich'' has grossed a cumulative $56.3 million in
its two weeks of release and is the second all-time top-grossing
film for March. ''Liar, Liar'' from 1997 holds the record for the
month.
</P>
<P>
   The second place ''Romeo'' is a tale of Asian and black gang
families vying for control of an American waterfront.
</P>
<P>
   The horror story ''Final Destination,'' a tale of teen-agers
stalked by death, was third for its second week in release with
$7.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Two films that competed -- along with ''Final Destination'' -- for
the teen market opened in the fifth and sixth box office slots.
''Here on Earth'' grossed an estimated $4.6 million, followed by
''Whatever it Takes'' with $4.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at North
American theaters, according to Exhibitor Relations. Final figures
were to be released today.
</P>
<P>
   1. ''Erin Brockovich,'' $19 million.
</P>
<P>
   2. ''Romeo Must Die,'' $18.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   3. ''Final Destination,'' $7.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   4. ''Mission to Mars,'' $5.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   5. ''Here on Earth,'' $4.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   6. ''Whatever it Takes,'' $4.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   7. ''American Beauty,'' $3.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   8. ''My Dog Skip,'' $3.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   9. ''The Cider House Rules,'' $2.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   10. ''The Whole Nine Yards,'' $2.1 million.

<HEADLINE> Los Angeles TV Helicopter Crashes  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A pilot and cameraman were injured when their
television news helicopter covering the Oscars crashed at a nearby
airfield and was consumed by a ball of fire.
</P>
<P>
   The helicopter left its Oscar hovering spot Sunday night and
crashed while attempting an emergency landing. The crash occurred
just after 10 p.m. in a helicopter landing area at Van Nuys Airport
about 15 miles northwest of the Shrine Auditorium, where the
Academy Awards had finished about 30 minutes before.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Howell, aboard KTLA-TV's helicopter, said the KTTV
helicopter pilot reported hydraulic problems as it arrived near the
Shrine and the pilot decided to head toward the Van Nuys Airport
under escort by KCAL-TV's helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   The helicopter crashed shortly after it made its distress call.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot, a 28-year-old woman, and the photographer, a
40-year-old man, were taken to Northridge Medical Center, said city
fire spokesman Brian Humphrey.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot was seriously hurt with a broken wrist, broken leg,
possibly fractured pelvis and possible concussion. The photographer
had a possible broken leg and cuts to his face, Humphrey said.
</P>
<P>
   Both were listed early today in serious condition, said nursing
supervisor Kim Khama.
</P>
<P>
   The helicopter belonged to KTTV-TV in Los Angeles, a Fox
affiliate. The names of the victims were not immediately released.
</P>
<P>
   KTTV anchorwoman Susan Hirasuna's voice nearly broke with
emotion Sunday night as she began to report a news story after word
of the crash. KTTV closed its 10 p.m. newscast with a request for
prayers for the two aboard the downed aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   The National Transportation Safety Board will investigate the
crash.

<HEADLINE> Hollywood Preps for Oscar Parties  </HEADLINE>
By CHELSEA J. CARTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Forget the Academy Awards.
</P>
<P>
   The real show was the post-Oscar party circuit -- from the
traditional Governor's Ball to Elton John's big party to Vanity
Fair's shining shindig -- where being seen was almost as important
as who won.
</P>
<P>
   But no place Sunday was it more true than the DreamWorks SKG
party at Spago, the trendy Beverly Hills restaurant where its five
golden wins for ''American Beauty'' were celebrated.
</P>
<P>
   Here, hundreds of fans pushed against metal barricades for a
glimpse of the famous and the sort of familiar. It's the place
Kevin Spacey hoisted his best actor Oscar over his head, while
Steven Spielberg ran down the red carpet shouting ''Great! Great!
Great!''
</P>
<P>
   ''How could you not want to be a part of this night?'' said
actor Scott Bakula, who played Spacey's gay neighbor in the
Oscar-winning movie.
</P>
<P>
   Anybody and everybody associated with the night's big winners
were on hand.
</P>
<P>
   Paula Abdul, who choreographed the cheerleading and fantasy
sequences in ''American Beauty,'' said she was thrilled to be a
part of the movie. ''They were small scenes, but they were pivotal
points,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Then there were those who just wanted to support friends.
</P>
<P>
   Dame Judy Dench, who won last year's best supporting actress
Oscar for rival Miramax's ''Shakespeare In Love,'' came to see
friend Sam Mendes, winner of the best director Oscar.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was surprised to how generous everybody was to the
British,'' she said, referring to Mendes and Michael Caine's best
supporting actor Oscar win. ''I was very shocked by that because
we're not like that. That kind of generosity is wonderful to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Even San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown was there, running the
gauntlet of press -- television, radio and newspaper reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm here because I was invited by my friends Warren and
Annette (Bening),'' he said. ''It's their night and I came to
celebrate with them.''
</P>
<P>
   After a quick wave to waiting fans, most ducked into the
restaurant, which put up a canopy on the street to accommodate the
thousands who attended.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wonder what's going on in there,'' said Judy Feldman, 27 of
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   While she and a group of friends could only image, guests inside
were treated to champagne and shrimp platters and, of course, roses
-- a staple in Spacey's fantasy sequences in the movie.
</P>
<P>
   ''American Beauty'' co-star Allison Janey, who left the awards
without an Oscar, still made off with her own reward -- a bouquet of
flowers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm stealing the roses from inside,'' she said. ''They have so
many inside.''
</P>
<P>
   But security guard Randy Carlson, 23, was more concerned with
the safety of Oscar than the roses.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've never seen an Oscar up close before. There are so many of
them here,'' he said, standing feet from Mendes' statue. ''I bet
they hold onto those all night.''

<HEADLINE> Columbine Gun Supplier To Appeal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- The man who sold a gun to the Columbine High
School killers plans to appeal his six-year sentence, saying he did
not know how they planned to use it.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Phil Cherner filed a notice with the Colorado Court of
Appeals of intent to appeal Mark Manes' sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think it is excessive,'' Cherner said last week.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson County District Judge Henry Nieto made fundamental
errors in sentencing Manes in November, Cherner said.
</P>
<P>
   Manes, 23, deserved a lighter sentence because he had no idea
how Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold intended to use the semiautomatic
TEC-DC9 handgun he sold them, Cherner said. With the gun and other
weapons, they killed 13 people at the high school before committing
suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Manes pleaded guilty in August to supplying a weapon to a minor.
He had sold the handgun to the killers for $500 in January 1999,
three months before the shootings.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson County's probation department had recommended a
lengthy probation rather than prison. But Nieto said during the
Nov. 12 sentencing that selling the gun was intrinsically tied to
the consequences at Columbine High.

<HEADLINE> Court Won't Nix Rock-Climbing Limits  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE ASSEO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today let the National Park
Service discourage rock-climbing on the Devils Tower National
Monument in Wyoming when American Indians hold sacred ceremonies at
the 600-foot butte.
</P>
<P>
   The court, without comment, rejected an unusual church-state
case in which rock climbers argued they should have legal standing
to challenge the Park Service policy.
</P>
<P>
   Devils Tower in northeastern Wyoming became the first national
monument in 1906 by proclamation of President Theodore Roosevelt.
The Park Service manages the monument, which attracts about 500,000
visitors each year.
</P>
<P>
   The Park Service counted about 6,000 rock-climbers at the
monument in 1994 and said the climbing has disturbed Indians who
hold sacred ceremonies there each June.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the Park Service began asking people to ''voluntarily
refrain'' from climbing on the monument during June ''in respect
for the reverence many American Indians hold for Devils Tower as a
sacred site.''
</P>
<P>
   The Park Service banned commercial licenses for climbing guides
during June, while leaving the policy voluntary for individual
climbers. The agency said that if the voluntary policy did not
reduce climbing each June, it would consider a mandatory closing.
</P>
<P>
   The policy was challenged in federal court by several individual
and commercial rock climbers and the Bear Lodge Multiple Use
Association, which seeks to maintain public access to natural
resources.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge in 1996 barred the Park Service from enforcing
the June ban on commercial climbing licenses but upheld the rest of
the policy.
</P>
<P>
   The 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that because the
only remaining part of the policy was voluntary, the climbers had
suffered no injury and had no standing to sue.
</P>
<P>
   In the appeal acted on today, the climbers' lawyers said the
policy was ''clearly coercive'' and violated the constitutionally
required separation of church and state.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department lawyers urged the justices to reject the
appeal. They said people ''remain free to climb whenever they want,
including during the month of June.''
</P>
<P>
   The case is Bear Lodge Multiple Use Association vs. Babbitt,
99-1045.

<HEADLINE> Supreme Court Rules Against LaRouche  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE ASSEO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Democratic Party lawfully refused to count
votes cast for political extremist Lyndon LaRouche in the 1996
presidential primaries, the Supreme Court ruled today.
</P>
<P>
   The court, upholding lower court rulings, rejected LaRouche's
argument that the Democratic Party's rules should have been cleared
by the Justice Department under the federal Voting Rights Act.
</P>
<P>
   Today's ruling was issued without an accompanying opinion. The
justices merely affirmed what a federal appeals court had ruled
previously.
</P>
<P>
   LaRouche has run for the Democratic presidential nomination in
every election since 1976. During the early 1990s, he served five
years in prison for mail fraud and conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1996, Democratic National Committee Chairman Donald
L. Fowler sent a letter to state party leaders saying LaRouche was
''not a bona fide Democrat'' because his beliefs were ''explicitly
racist and anti-Semitic.''
</P>
<P>
   Fowler said state parties should disregard any votes cast for
him in primaries or caucuses and should not allocate any delegates
to him.
</P>
<P>
   LaRouche was not barred from any primary ballots. He contended
he got enough votes but was denied representation in nominating
activities in Louisiana, Virginia, Texas, Arizona and the District
of Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   He sued Fowler, the Democratic National Committee, and the party
organizations in the four states and the District of Columbia.
LaRouche contended the nominating procedures violated his civil
rights and had not won proper Voting Rights Act clearance.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge dismissed the civil rights claim, and a
three-judge court later ruled against LaRouche on the voting rights
issue. The national Democratic Party is not covered by the Voting
Rights Act and state parties have a freedom-of-association right to
exclude him, the appeals court concluded.
</P>
<P>
   LaRouche's appeal to the Supreme Court said political parties
cannot exclude him just as they cannot exclude minority voters.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic Party's lawyers urged the justices to reject
LaRouche's appeal, telling them the national party rule ''is
entitled to the greatest degree of constitutional protection.''

<HEADLINE> Haitian Immigrant Loses Appeal  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD CARELLI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today rejected the appeal of
a man jailed by immigration officials in Miami since his return in
late 1997 from a two-day trip to his native Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   The justices, without comment, let stand a ruling that said
Ralph Richardson, a legal immigrant who lived in the United States
for 29 years, is not entitled to a federal court hearing on the
legality of his detention.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson first emigrated to this country in 1968 as a young
child with his family, which lived for many years in Georgia. In
1990, he was convicted and sentenced to five years in prison on
cocaine-related charges.
</P>
<P>
   After completing his sentence, Richardson remained a legal
permanent resident alien. In October 1997, he left the country for
a brief visit to Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson was detained when he tried to re-enter the country,
and Immigration and Naturalization Service officials sought to have
him deported as an immigrant ''seeking admission into the United
States.'' They said he was inadmissible because of his drug crime.
</P>
<P>
   He has been jailed, without bond, at Miami's Krome Detention
Center ever since.
</P>
<P>
   A federal trial judge ruled that Richardson wrongly was denied a
hearing on his attempt to be released pending INS action in his
case. But the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals set aside that
ruling.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court said a 1996 law, the Illegal Immigration
Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act, did away with the
possibility of release on bond for immigrants in Richardson's
position. Immigrants no longer have the right to a federal court
hearing before removal proceedings are ended, the 11th Circuit
court ruled.
</P>
<P>
   In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for Richardson said the
appeals court ruling ''has profound implications for all persons
currently detained ... awaiting removal proceedings.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The decision to forestall review of detention until the end of
the removal process renders such review illusory for Mr. Richardson
and the thousands of aliens who will be detained for long periods
of time,'' the appeal contended.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department lawyers urged the court to reject
Richardson's appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The case is Richardson vs. Reno, 99-887.

<HEADLINE> Court Sidesteps Student Bankruptcy  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD CARELLI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today steered clear of a
dispute over people who file for federal bankruptcy protection and
then try to avoid paying back student loans from state-run colleges
and universities.
</P>
<P>
   The justices, without comment, rejected an appeal in which
Kansas officials said state schools are immune from such maneuvers
because the Constitution's 11th Amendment shields them from being
sued in federal court.
</P>
<P>
   Lower courts ruled against such immunity, but Kansas' appeal was
supported by a friend-of-the-court brief filed in behalf of 24
other states.
</P>
<P>
   While attending Kansas State University, Mark and Genevieve
Innes received student loans under a program in which public and
private schools receive federal funding for the purpose of
extending such loans.
</P>
<P>
   After graduation, the couple filed for bankruptcy in Topeka and
sought to have the loan debts wiped out as undue hardships. Kansas
State officials asked a federal bankruptcy judge to dismiss that
effort, relying on its 11th Amendment immunity.
</P>
<P>
   The bankruptcy judge, a federal trial judge and the 10th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals all ruled that the university, an agent of
the state government, had waived its immunity by signing an
agreement with the federal Department of Education to participate
in the Perkins Loan program.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement requires participating universities to oppose any
borrower's bankruptcy-court request for a discharge of the loan
debt.
</P>
<P>
   In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for Kansas argued that the
state-run school had not waived its immunity simply by agreeing to
follow federal regulations. ''The 11th Amendment can only be waived
by express waiver ... not by mere contractual agreements to follow
federal regulations,'' they said.
</P>
<P>
   The appeal was supported in a brief filed the Texas attorney
general's office and joined in by officials from Alabama, Alaska,
Arkansas, California, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Louisiana,
Michigan, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, North
Dakota, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah,
Vermont, Washington and Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   The federal bankruptcy judge has not yet ruled whether the debt
from the Innes' student loans can be wiped out. A trial on that
issue is scheduled for early April.
</P>
<P>
   The case is Kansas State University vs. Innes, 99-1048.

<HEADLINE> 78 Million People Watch Oscars  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- An estimated 78 million Americans watched at
least some of the lengthy Academy Awards telecast, with overnight
ratings drooping slightly from last year, Nielsen Media Research
said today.
</P>
<P>
   The Oscar telecast drew a 31.7 rating and 48 audience share,
down 1 percent from its overnight ratings the year before.
</P>
<P>
   The overnight ratings measure the audience in 47 markets metered
by Nielsen, comprising two-thirds of the country. Full national
ratings are due later this afternoon, and they tend to be lower
than in the big cities.
</P>
<P>
   With ''American Beauty'' and its lead actor, Kevin Spacey,
winning the big awards, the Oscar telecast stretched to more than
four hours. That came despite promises from producers to move
things along.
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 show's ratings were itself a dropoff of 21 percent from
the year before, when ''Titanic'' swept the awards. The Oscars are
traditionally the highest-rated entertainment special of the year,
with fluctuations in viewership dependent on the popularity of its
honored movies.
</P>
<P>
   ''Anytime you can get a 31.7 rating, where a third of the
country is tuning in to your program and watching your commercials,
we're happy,'' said Larry Hyams, ABC's chief researcher.

<HEADLINE> Justices Won't Restore Food Stamps  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE ASSEO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today refused to force the
government to restore food stamps and other benefits for legal
immigrants cut off in a massive 1996 welfare overhaul.
</P>
<P>
   The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by Chicago
officials and a group of noncitizen residents who said the 1996 law
violated their equal-protection rights.
</P>
<P>
   ''The federal government ... is forbidden to balance its budget
by denying welfare benefits to lawful permanent residents,'' the
appeal had contended.
</P>
<P>
   In other cases today, the court:
</P>
<P>
   --Ruled that the Democratic Party lawfully refused to count votes
cast for political extremist Lyndon LaRouche in the 1996
presidential primaries. The court, upholding lower court rulings,
rejected LaRouche's argument that the Democratic Party's rules
should have been cleared by the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   -- Let the National Park Service discourage rock-climbing on the
Devils Tower National Monument in Wyoming when American Indians
hold sacred ceremonies at the 600-foot butte. The court rejected an
unusual church-state case in which rock climbers argued they should
have legal standing to challenge the Park Service policy.
</P>
<P>
   --Steered clear of a dispute over people who file for federal
bankruptcy protection and then try to avoid paying back student
loans from state-run colleges and universities. The justices
rejected an appeal in which Kansas officials said state schools are
immune from such maneuvers because the Constitution's 11th
Amendment shields them from being sued in federal court.
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 Welfare Reform Act, which dramatically cut welfare
rolls nationwide, barred noncitizens living in this country from
collecting food stamps and disability benefits through Supplemental
Security Income.
</P>
<P>
   Immigrants also were barred from collecting general welfare
benefits and Medicaid until they live in the United States for five
years.
</P>
<P>
   The cutoff was intended to encourage immigrants to be
self-sufficient and to ensure that welfare benefits do not create
an incentive for people to emigrate to this country.
</P>
<P>
   Congress later restored food stamps and SSI disability benefits
to some immigrants living in the United States before August 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The city of Chicago and a group of legal immigrants challenged
the welfare law in federal court, saying it violated some
immigrants' equal-protection rights.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge upheld the limits on benefits, and the 7th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals agreed. The government is not required to
give all aliens the same welfare benefits provided for citizens,
the appeals court ruled.
</P>
<P>
   In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for Chicago and the
immigrants said Congress' decision to allow people into the country
but deny them benefits unfairly raises costs for state and local
governments.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department lawyers said the benefit restrictions were a
valid restriction on aliens' conduct in the United States. They
noted that the Supreme Court in 1996 let the government require
immigrants to live in this country for five years before collecting
Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   The case is Chicago vs. Shalala, 99-898.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks turned mostly lower today as Microsoft

<HEADLINE> 'American Beauty' Celebrates  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GERMAIN, AP Entertainment Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- When ''American Beauty'' hit theaters last
fall, many were surprised when it became a box-office hit and an
Oscar front-runner.
</P>
<P>
   By Sunday night, though, it came as no surprise that the
sobering satire of suburbia dominated the Academy Awards. In an
industry whose recent top honors have mostly gone to splashy epics,
''American Beauty'' had simply built up too much critical and
popular esteem to be denied.
</P>
<P>
   The film won five awards: best picture, best actor for Kevin
Spacey, best director for Sam Mendes, best original screenplay for
Alan Ball and best cinematography for Conrad L. Hall. The ceremony,
which at four hours plus was the longest on record, was seen in
whole or in part by an estimated 78 million Americans, with
overnight ratings down slightly from last year, according to
Nielsen figures released today.
</P>
<P>
   Might the success of the dark yet wildly absurd ''American
Beauty'' herald Hollywood's return to such thoughtful,
character-driven films as ''Midnight Cowboy'' and ''One Flew Over
the Cuckoo's Nest,'' both best-picture winners?
</P>
<P>
   First-time director Mendes, steeped in such films growing up,
hopes so.
</P>
<P>
   ''The more of these sorts of movies that get made and the more
they get acknowledged by the mainstream, the better,'' said Mendes,
an acclaimed theater director.
</P>
<P>
   Spacey, whose character undergoes a transformation after almost
consummating an affair with his daughter's high-school friend, said
the movie hit home with audiences because ''we got to see all of
his worst qualities, and we still grew to love him.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We get a chance to see characters have experiences that make
us feel that we're not the only ones who have those feelings,''
said Spacey. ''We sort of have a collective admission when we see
characters do those things that we do.''
</P>
<P>
   The best-picture win was sweet revenge for ''American Beauty''
distributor DreamWorks, the studio co-founded by Steven Spielberg,
whose ''Saving Private Ryan'' lost best-picture honors last year to
Disney-owned Miramax's ''Shakespeare in Love.''
</P>
<P>
   Spielberg, who won for best director last year for ''Saving
Private Ryan,'' presented the director's award to Mendes. It was
the first best-picture win for DreamWorks, founded five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The evening was not a sweep for ''American Beauty.'' Hilary
Swank, a virtual unknown, won the best actress award for another
dark film, ''Boys Don't Cry,'' based on the true story of Brandon
Teena, a woman who lived as a man and was killed when her true
gender was uncovered.
</P>
<P>
   ''I consider myself someone who cares a huge amount about
humanity and I think that this movie opens the door to letting
people know what goes on in society and hopefully putting an end to
intolerance in the future,'' Swank said.
</P>
<P>
   Other top winners included Angelina Jolie for best supporting
actress for her turn as a hospitalized sociopath in ''Girl,
Interrupted.'' Michael Caine won his second best supporting actor
award for his role as an ether-sniffing abortionist who runs an
orphanage in ''The Cider House Rules.''
</P>
<P>
   John Irving won for best adapted screenplay for the script of
his novel ''The Cider House Rules.''
</P>
<P>
   Phil Collins took the Oscar for original song for ''You'll Be in
My Heart'' from ''Tarzan.'' Pedro Almodovar's ''All About My
Mother'' won for foreign-language film.
</P>
<P>
   The glitzy sci-fi thriller ''The Matrix'' won in all four
categories for which it was nominated -- visual effects, film
editing, sound and sound-effects editing.
</P>
<P>
   Caustic and kooky, ''American Beauty'' was a seriocomic tale of
suburban lunacy that ran counter to big-picture epics such as
''Titanic,'' ''Schindler's List,'' ''Braveheart'' and ''The English
Patient'' that have dominated the Oscars.
</P>
<P>
   The Oscars have occasionally gone dark and disturbing in recent
years. In 1991, the serial-killer flick ''The Silence of the
Lambs'' was an atypical winner, while Clint Eastwood's anti-hero
western ''Unforgiven'' took top honors the next year.
</P>
<P>
   Shot for $15 million, ''American Beauty'' has gone on to top
$108 million at the box office while playing in barely half as many
theaters as many top Hollywood movies.
</P>
<P>
   The movie, however, had all the quirks, tics and warts that
should have relegated it to the list of critics' darlings and
modest box-office successes.
</P>
<P>
   Consider its characters: a middle-aged chump who lusts after his
daughter's friend; a shrill wife empowered by her pistol and her
farcical fling with the local real-estate king; a homophobic Marine
colonel who tests his son's urine for drugs; and a teen-age video
voyeur who peddles pot and philosophizes about a plastic bag
dancing in the wind.
</P>
<P>
   Screenwriter Ball said ''American Beauty's'' triumph taught him
to ''write what moves you.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The lesson I've learned out of this is really follow your
heart and follow your passion, and follow your guts and just sit
down and write it,'' Ball said.

<HEADLINE> Oscar Brings Joy to Farming Town  </HEADLINE>
By ADAM BROWN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADRID, Spain (AP) -- Spanish director Pedro Almodovar's Oscar
won tears of joy from his aunt, congratulations from Barcelona's
mayor and a sleepless night for the small farmtown where he was
born.
</P>
<P>
   Almodovar's Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film for ''All About
My Mother, ''made me cry, laugh and scream,'' said Cecilia
Almodovar, the director's elderly aunt in Calzada de Calatrava, the
farming community of 5,000 people where Almodovar was born.
</P>
<P>
   Cecilia, one of 11 sibling of Almodovar's recently-deceased
mother, said she stayed awake all night to watch the awards
ceremonies along with many other residents of the town located 100
miles south of Madrid.
</P>
<P>
   She told state news agency Efe that she expects a visit from her
nephew later this week and will accompany him to pay respects to
the patron saint of the town.
</P>
<P>
   Almodovar on Sunday became the 10th Spaniard to win an Oscar.
</P>
<P>
   The last Oscar for a Spaniard, also for Best Foreign Language
Film, came in 1994 for director Fernando Trueba and his ''Belle
Epoque.''
</P>
<P>
   Almodovar's films were the first to register success outside of
Spain after the 1975 death of dictator Gen. Francisco Franco
ushered in democracy and a resurgence of the arts.
</P>
<P>
   Spanish State Secretary for Culture Miguel Angel Cortes
predicted the Oscar would ''give a boost to Spanish cinema outside
of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Cortes said the award ''recognizes (Almodovar's) talent as a
director as well as the talent of the whole team that made it
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Joan Clos the mayor of Barcelona -- where the film is set -- sent
Almodovar a letter of congratulations. The mayor had earlier
expressed hopes that the film could boost his city's international
reputation.
</P>
<P>
   Hours after the awards, which were broadcast after 2 a.m. in
Spain, prominent Spaniards sent Almodovar telegrams of
congratulations while radio and television buzzed with the news.

<HEADLINE> Storms KO Power Lines in South  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Thunderstorms damaged buildings and knocked down
power lines
from Missouri into Texas with wind strong enough to blow trucks off
a highway and hail as big as baseballs.
<TEXT>
<P>
   No serious injuries were reported.
</P>
<P>
   Funnel clouds were spotted in parts of central Texas during the

management coordinator for Seguin.
</P>
<P>
   ''The storm was too thick and too fast for us to really see

   Wind estimated at 70 mph blew tractor-trailer rigs off
Interstate 35 near Salado, Texas, according to the National Weather

   Wind topped 85 mph in parts of Oklahoma, the weather service

Pittsburg County, but no major damage was reported.
</P>
<P>
   Funnel clouds were reported in Missouri, where wind up to 70 mph
near Hallsville ripped roofs or siding off a dozen homes and
snapped trees off at the base.

<HEADLINE> More Than 25 Bombs Hit South Sudan  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) -- The Sudanese government bombed two
civilian hospitals in rebel-held areas of southern Sudan last week,
rebels and aid agencies said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Gideon Gatele, logistics officer for U.S.-based aid group,
Samaritan's Purse, said up to 14 bombs aimed at a hospital the
organization runs in Lui, 85 miles northwest of Juba, were dropped
on March 22 and 23.
</P>
<P>
   Juba is the largest town in southern Sudan still under
government control.
</P>
<P>
   It was the fourth time the hospital has been targeted this year,
Gatele told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's (the bombing) all in the same region and looks like
systematic bombing or targeting,'' he said. ''It could be a prelude
to more fighting.''
</P>
<P>
   Gatele said the bombs in the latest attack missed the 120-bed
hospital and there were no casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Sudanese authorities were unavailable for comment Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Eight bombs were also dropped on a camp for displaced people in
Kotobi on Friday, another eight targeted a hospital in Tali on
Saturday, and an unknown number were dropped in Kaya and Morobo on
the Ugandan border during the last week, according to Samson Kwaje,
spokesman for the Sudan People's Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   Kwaje said the hospital in Tali, 80 miles north of Juba, is run
by ZOA Refugee Care, a Dutch organization. He said there were no
details of casualties, but people in Tali had been told to evacuate
the town. It was not immediately possible to contact ZOA.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Aloo, security officer for Norwegian People's Aid, which
has a food relief camp in Tali, confirmed the bombing and said a
pregnant woman was killed in the attack.
</P>
<P>
   In Uganda, Capt. Shaban Bantariza, a spokesman for the Ugandan
army, told The Associated Press that Sudanese government bombs had
also landed on the East African country's territory.
</P>
<P>
   Uganda broke diplomatic relations with Sudan in 1994, accusing
it of aiding rebels fighting in northern Uganda and others
operating from mountain bases in western Uganda and eastern Congo.
</P>
<P>
   Sudan says Uganda has supported the Sudan People's Liberation
Army, which is fighting for increased autonomy in Sudan's
predominantly Christian and animist south. Nearly 2 million people
have died in Sudan's 17-year civil war and another 4 million have
been uprooted.

<HEADLINE> Search Ends for Two Teens in Pacific  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHELTER COVE, Calif. (AP) -- The Coast Guard on Monday called off
its search for two Canadian teen-age boys who tried to rescue a
woman after she was swept into the frigid Pacific and drowned.
</P>
<P>
   There had been no signs of the boys in the 48-degree water since
the incident Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The ocean is unpredictable, and there's no way to know where
they may surface,'' Coast Guard Petty Officer Michael Burgess said.
</P>
<P>
   The victims were part of a group of 18 students and six adults
who had traveled from William Aberhart High School in Calgary,
Alberta, to hike along the isolated coast 220 miles north of San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Clement, 45, was caught by a wave and pulled out to sea.
The two 17-year-old students, David Elton and Brodie Macdonald,
jumped into the water to try to rescue her.
</P>
<P>
   A few moments later, teacher Martin Poirier, 37, and a third
student, Jordan Nixon, 17, tried to rescue the boys and Clement.
</P>
<P>
   All four were captured by the powerful rip tide. Clement
drowned, while Poirier and Nixon were dragged out of the pounding
waves by fishermen. Macdonald and Elton were presumed dead.
</P>
<P>
   Locals said the stretch of beach is extremely dangerous because
of the strong undertow, rip currents and unpredictable waves.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's been vehicles washed off that beach,'' said Pete
Winkler, who was fishing for salmon when he heard the Coast Guard's
call for help and joined in the search.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Congratulates Putin  </HEADLINE>
By WILLIAM C. MANN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton congratulated Vladimir Putin
today for his victory in the Russian presidential election, and
used the opportunity to press U.S. dismay over the situation in
ravaged Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   ''President-elect Putin has an opportunity to translate his
electoral mandate into concrete steps to advance economic reform,
to strengthen the rule of law, to intensify the fight against crime
and corruption, and to join with us on a broad common agenda of
international security including arms control, nonproliferation and
regional peace and stability,'' Clinton said in a statement issued
at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he stressed the U.S. view that Russia must launch
''impartial and transparent investigations of reported human rights
violations'' in Chechnya, and allow prompt, full access to the
province for international relief organizations and the press.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is uncertain how vigorously Putin
will pursue democratic change in Russia as president, but Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright says his words have the right tone.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we're going to have to see'' how strong Putin's
commitment to democracy is, Albright said Sunday on CNN's ''Late
Edition.'' ''Certainly he uses all the right vocabulary when he
talks about having the support of the people.''
</P>
<P>
   With 94 percent of the vote reported from Sunday's election, the
47-year-old acting president and former KGB intelligence officer
was winning with 52.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's historic that the Russians are having such an election,
that there is a transfer of power in a democratic, constitutional
way,'' Albright said. ''But I don't think we should prejudge him.
... I think we've just got to see what his actions are. His words
are OK, but we have to watch his actions.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright, speaking from Geneva, where she was with Clinton for
his meeting with Syrian President Hafez Assad, said Russians
clearly want a more ordered society.
</P>
<P>
   ''The question is whether it's order with a small or a capital
'O,''' she said on CBS' ''Face the Nation.'' ''None of us would
like to see order with a capital 'O.' But one can understand why
the Russians, after a certain chaotic period, would like to see
some greater order in their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Alluding to Putin's ties to the former Soviet secret police,
Albright said people ''have to stop the psychobabble'' about the
Russian leader. But she made clear that the administration is wary
of just how far he would go toward strong-arming Russia's
disordered post-communist society into submission.
</P>
<P>
   A big reason is the brutally suppressed rebellion in the
Caucasus region of Chechnya. Many analysts say Putin's tactics
there helped drive his election success.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've made quite clear to him that the Russian way of
proceeding (in Chechnya) is of great concern to us,'' Albright
said.
</P>
<P>
   But she said Putin ''has in many of his conversations with us
indicated that there are lots of things to work with him on,'' such
as economic reform and arms control.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Congress expressed similar uncertainty about
post-Soviet Russia's prospects under Putin.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif., chairman of House Speaker Dennis
Hastert's special advisory group on Russia, was in Moscow to
monitor the voting.
</P>
<P>
   Putin ''is said to be a law-and-order candidate. That's an
interesting selection of words,'' Cox said on CNN. ''Will it be law
supporting order, or just the order part?''
</P>
<P>
   Americans must remember that ''the United States has to take
things as we find them, not as we want them to be,'' Cox added.
</P>
<P>
   Putin is ''an enigma,'' Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott said
on NBC's ''Meet the Press.'' ''He seems to be moving toward ...
opening up and some reforms, and yet there is a throwback quality
that's got to worry us.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott, R-Miss., said ''some of the tactics sound to me like old
KGB tactics,'' especially Putin's apparent manipulation of Russian
news media.
</P>
<P>
   ''But he's young,'' Lott said. ''He may be a very pleasant
surprise.''

<P>
   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) -- Tamil guerrillas launched an attack to
capture a strategic causeway linking the mainland with Jaffna
Peninsula, killing 11 soldiers and losing 15 fighters, an army
spokesman said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Another 23 soldiers were wounded in fighting that began Sunday
and continued to rage Monday, said Major J.D.A. Gunasekera, the
military spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Since November, the rebels have been trying to regain Jaffna,
which had served as their stronghold until the military took
control in 1996. Jaffna is linked to the mainland by the narrow
Elephant Pass causeway.
</P>
<P>
   The guerrillas pounded military positions with mortars and
artillery during the night Sunday. The navy destroyed two rebel
vessels that tried to reach the eastern shore of the peninsula,
said Gunasekera, the military spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, in a statement faxed from
their London office, said Sri Lankan troops suffered heavy
casualties.
</P>
<P>
   More than 61,000 people have been killed since the war erupted
in 1983. The guerrillas have been fighting for a separate homeland
for the minority Tamils, accusing the majority Sinhalese of
widespread discrimination in education and jobs.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed today as Microsoft fell in
advance of a judge's antitrust ruling, weighing on every major
market index. Strength in other technology companies helped keep
the Nasdaq in positive territory.
</P>
<P>
   In midday trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was down 43.74 at 11,068.98, having reversed an early gain.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Nasdaq composite index
was up 32.90 at 4,995.93 and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was
down 1.76 at 1,525.70.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft fell 4] to 107 5/16, and was the most actively traded
Nasdaq stock. Government lawyers reportedly have concluded
Microsoft's offer to settle its antitrust case was inadequate, and
they are preparing for U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson
to deliver a verdict Tuesday. Jackson has previously hinted he will
rule strongly against Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Many other technology companies advanced today.
</P>
<P>
   IBM rose 6 to 126| after Morgan Stanley Dean Witter raised its
rating on the stock from ''neutral'' to ''outperform.''
</P>
<P>
   Unisys rose 2| to 29\ after a German magazine reported Deutsche
Telekom is interested in acquiring it. Unisys declined to comment
to Dow Jones News Service, and called the report a rumor.
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks before companies begin reporting their
first-quarter earnings, technology stocks are likely to lead the
market as investors buy them on the promise of strong earnings
growth, said John H. Shaughnessy, chief investment strategist at
Advest Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe stock selection should continue to focus on those
companies with strong earnings momentum,'' he said. ''This would
include technology stocks.''
</P>
<P>
   The earnings reporting season will gather momentum in mid-April.
Until then, traders said the market may remain in a fairly narrow
range with no clear catalyst to spark a major swing in either
direction.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of oil producers were trading actively as OPEC oil
ministers met in Vienna, struggling to reach a consensus about
boosting their petroleum output. OPEC members were considering
raising production by 1.5 million to 1.7 million barrels a day,
which would bring oil prices down from nine-year highs.
</P>
<P>
   Exxon Mobil was down 1 5/16 at 75 15/16 and Texaco was down 9/16
at 50{.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 5-to-4 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 398.33 million
shares, well behind Friday's pace.
</P>

   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 1.07 to 575.08.

   ''As Long As You're Living Yours: The Music of Keith Jarrett''
(RCA Victor) -- Various Artists
</P>
<P>
   Tribute recordings can squeeze the life out of the original
compositions, sometimes through over-interpretation, sometimes
through the wrong selection of artists and genres (just because you
could have a heavy metal interpretation of a Duke Ellington
standard is no reason to do so).
</P>
<P>
   ''As Long As You're Living Yours: The Music of Keith Jarrett''
mostly avoids the pitfalls to give some clever reworkings of music
from across Jarrett's vast catalog. One of the most prolific modern
20th century jazz composers and a pianist without parallel, Jarrett
is at home with any number of styles, from standards to
improvisational, classical and even sacred.
</P>
<P>
   ''As Long As You're Living Yours'' doesn't venture into
improvisational jazz, but does touch the classical. Violinist Nadja
Salerno-Sonnenberg teams with contemporary jazz pianist Bob James
for a beautiful reading of ''Book of Ways 9.''
</P>
<P>
   Other renditions of note include straight-ahead versions of
''Innocence'' by saxophonist George Garzone and ''Shades of Jazz''
by hornmen Joe Lovano and Tom Harrell; Nueva Rhumba's
Latin-flavored ''So Tender'' and pianist D.D. Jackson's soulful
take on ''Everything That Lives Laments.''

   ''Love Stories'' (Columbia) -- Frank McComb
</P>
<P>
   My, my, my, what a joyful way to quench a thirst!
</P>
<P>
   Frank McComb's Columbia debut, ''Love Stories,'' is a slow-wine
salute to classic rhythm and blues, sprinkled with a little bit of
gospel and a hungry-man helping of jazz. Thoughtful and deeply
personal, this disc relies on the singer's talents, rather than
calling on the cheap give-it-to-me-baby/bump 'n' grind gimmicks
that dilute so many ''romantic'' tunes receiving airplay now.
There's not a ''sex sells'' parachute to soften the disc's landing;
the production stands on its own merits.
</P>
<P>
   McComb takes it to church on the introduction of ''Love
Stories,'' a sanctified rendition of ''His Eye is on the Sparrow''
anchored by his lush vocals, and a wisely muted piano that afford
the words space to breathe. When McComb rips up a funky cut (check
out ''They're Gonna Be Looking at You''), it's easy to have fun
with him. (Listen for a special treat at the end of a hidden track
on the disc, an all-too-brief but hilarious and dead-on Al Green
impersonation). Other songs like ''Listen to Your Heart,'' ''If
This is Love'' and ''Wasting Your Time'' are soft and romantic. The
understatement of these gems is a refreshing departure from some
abrasive mainstream hits.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most poignant offering here is the simple ''Wedding
Song.'' He's a young man, but McComb sounds mature when he sings
about the blessed union of a husband and wife. It's about pure
love, sans raunchy details.
</P>
<P>
   ''Love Stories'' is an elegant debut from a pure artist.

   ''The Big Bang! Best Of The MC5'' (Rhino) -- MC5
</P>
<P>
   Once upon a time, electric guitars provided the soundtrack for a
revolution. With a thunderous squall, they inspired the young and
terrified the establishment. Ah, those were the days.
</P>
<P>
   This compilation of 21 tunes by Detroit's MC5 (short for Motor
City Five) is a reminder that rock once mattered. Beginning with
its debut live album in 1969, the band played as though it believed
it really could change the world, which made the group naive but
fascinating.
</P>
<P>
   The MC5 made its initial splash as the house band for the
radical White Panther Party, which endorsed free material goods and
''the end of money.'' It's unclear how the band promoted such ideas
while trying to sell records, but at any rate the MC5 struggled
commercially and folded after three albums.
</P>
<P>
   Musically the approach was also radical but deceptively simple:
Combine Chuck Berry and James Brown with Sun Ra and crank the
guitars up to 11. The results have influenced punk, heavy metal and
rap groups ever since.
</P>
<P>
   The Rhino set starts with three early sides that had been out of
print for more than 30 years. There are four cuts from the wild,
feedback-filled live album ''Kick Out The Jams,'' preceded by the
greatest stage introduction in the history of entertainment. The
band's subsequent songs for two studio albums were tamer but even
better, because the performances were more focused and less
political. Such bids for the Top 40 as ''High School'' and
''Shakin' Street'' sound a lot cooler than just about anything on
the radio then -- or now.

<HEADLINE> Hyundai Founder Picks Successor  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL SHIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- The founder of South Korea's largest
conglomerate endorsed his fifth son as his successor Monday, ending
a two-week long feud for control of the Hyundai group.
</P>
<P>
   Chung Ju-yung, 84, selected Mong-hun, 52, as head of Hyundai in
a departure from the Korean tradition of favoring the oldest son as
the successor to a family business.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was announced after two weeks of bickering between
Mong-hun and his oldest brother, Mong-ku, 62, both of whom claimed
to have been chosen as successor. The elder brother will head up
the group's auto units, Hyundai Motors Co. and Kia Motors Co.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the family feud was likely to speed the breakup of
Hyundai, which has $70 billion in assets and had $75 billion in
revenues last year.
</P>
<P>
   ''The feud illustrates how important and urgent a task it is to
reform an inefficient Korean business style,'' said Lee Woo-yong,
an economics professor at Sogang University.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea's family-owned businesses, or chaebol, had expanded
recklessly for decades with cheap bank loans in collusion with past
military-backed governments. A dozen of them went under in 1997 as
Korea's economy was hit by a financial crisis and an economic
slowdown.
</P>
<P>
   Since taking office in early 1998, President Kim Dae-jung has
pushed chaebol to adopt modern management methods, shed
money-losing subsidiaries and trim their debt.
</P>
<P>
   In a meeting of dozens of chief executives of group subsidiaries
Monday, Chung Ju-yung announced that Mong-hun would take over the
reins of the company immediately.
</P>
<P>
   The row began when Mong-ku, then co-chairman of Hyundai, demoted
Lee Ik-chi, a close confidant of his rival brother. The move was
seen as his effort to gain control of the group.
</P>
<P>
   Hyundai's internal dispute attracted much public attention in
Korea and touched off fresh debate over what critics call an
undemocratic management style at the chaebol groups.
</P>
<P>
   ''It reveals that a representative conglomerate of the country
still remains under the control of one man, without setting in
motion a modern management system,'' the Chosun Ilbo, the nation's
largest daily newspaper, said in an editorial.
</P>
<P>
   Hyundai currently has 33 subsidiaries producing ships, cars,
computer chips and a host of other products. All of the
subsidiaries are controlled by the Chung family.
</P>
<P>
   Hyundai announced last year that by 2003, it will be broken into
five mini-groups specializing in cars, electronics, heavy
industries, construction and finance.
</P>
<P>
   Industry officials said the conglomerate will now be split and
owned 70 percent by the fifth son, 20 percent by the oldest son and
10 percent by other Chung offspring.
</P>
<P>
   Major subsidiaries under the fifth son's domain will include
Hyundai Electronics Co., Hyundai Engineering and Construction Co.
and Hyundai Merchant and Marine Co.
</P>
<P>
   The shipbuilding arm, Hyundai Heavy Industries, is controlled by
Chung Ju-yung's sixth son, Mong-joon, a legislator and a vice
president of FIFA, the world's soccer governing body.

<HEADLINE> Retrial of Ex-Detroit Cop Begins  </HEADLINE>
By JIM SUHR, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- Rapping a heavy police flashlight on the jury box
for emphasis, a prosecutor said Monday that a white policeman
decided ''again and again and again'' to use his flashlight to beat
a black motorist on his head in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Malice Green, 35, suffered a seizure and died after he was hit
on the head at least 14 times.
</P>
<P>
   Two white officers, Larry Nevers and Walter Budzyn, were
convicted of second-degree murder in 1993. But their convictions
were overturned five months apart in 1997 -- in part because the
jury watched the movie ''Malcolm X'' -- which contains footage of
the Rodney King beating -- during a break in deliberations.
</P>
<P>
   Budzyn was retried and convicted in 1998 of involuntary
manslaughter and is free today after the judge sentenced him to
time served. Opening statements began Monday in Nevers' retrial.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor Doug Baker said Nevers hit Green with his police
flashlight at least 10 times on the head.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not talking about some deadly split-second decision to
use police force. We're talking about a protracted beating where
the decision was made again and again and again to inflict the
blows to his head,'' Baker said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevers' attorney, Neil Fink, said Nevers responded with the
flashlight only after Green began struggling with Budzyn. Fink also
said Nevers used the flashlight in a ''flicking motion'' but did
not bludgeon Green as prosecutors contend.
</P>
<P>
   ''It might mess up your face but it was not designed to be fatal
force,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Bush, Gore Embrace Fathers' Goals  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRIGITTE GREENBERG
Associated Press Writer
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- George W. Bush always had to contend with his
father's sizable shadow and the mocking comparisons -- Junior,
little George. When Al Gore, the senator's son, returned home from
Vietnam, he announced that he wanted nothing to do with politics.
</P>
<P>
   Both rebelled, for a time. Both tried to compete with their dads
at other times. And both were profoundly affected -- perhaps even
motivated to run for the highest office in the land -- by their
fathers' disappointments.
</P>
<P>
   ''Had my dad won the presidency in '92, I would not have run for
governor in '94, and had I not run for governor in '94, it is very
unlikely I'd be sitting here,'' the Texas governor said this year.
</P>
<P>
   When Gore's father died two years ago at the age of 90, the vice
president recalled how his dad lost his Senate seat from Tennessee
largely because he opposed the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   ''My father was brave. I mean really brave,'' Gore said. ''The
night he lost -- in 1970 -- he made me prouder still. He said:
'Defeat may serve as well as victory to shake the soul and let the
glory out.' And then he turned the old Southern segregationist
slogan on its head and declared: 'The truth shall rise again.'''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Gurian, a family therapist who has written several books
about father-son relationships, said seeing a father humbled can
jolt a son into action.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's called redeeming the father,'' Gurian said. ''Any way
that the father's image has been sullied means that the son's image
has been sullied because the image of the father is the image of
the son.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarities in image weren't always so clear for the Bushes.
Years ago, the friction between them was palpable. The younger Bush
admittedly drank to excess, and one time, with his 15-year-old
brother, Marvin, in the car, he drove home inebriated.
</P>
<P>
   George W., 26 at the time, barreled into a neighbor's garbage
can and dragged the clanking metal can down the street, according
to a 1989 Time magazine account. When he stumbled through the front
door of his house, his father wanted to see him in the den --
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hear you're looking for me. You want to go mano a mano right
here?'' George W. reportedly said before younger brother, Jeb,
intervened to block a physical confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, on the other hand, didn't openly defy his taskmaster
father, but relatives and friends said he did feel pressured. Sen.
Albert Gore was known to dance around when his son earned good
grades, require his son to do 50 push-ups every morning, and wake
him at sunup to do chores.
</P>
<P>
   Gore usually rose to his father's challenges. Friends have said
he was so dutiful that he went to Vietnam to help his father's
foundering bid for re-election, even though he was opposed to the
war.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until he came home that he set out on his own path.
Rather than go into politics, he started religious studies and then
became a newspaper reporter. When he did go into the family
business -- politics -- by running for Congress in 1976, he tried to
distance himself from his father.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't want people voting for me because I'm Albert Gore's
son,'' he told a friend at the time, according to the biography
''Inventing Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   Gurian surmised that the presidential bids by Bush and Gore may,
in part, be driven by competition, a ''relentless pursuit of
parity'' with their fathers.
</P>
<P>
   ''The high achieving son generally attempts to equal or even
supplant the father,'' Gurian said, ''so hypothetically, Al Gore
has already achieved being a senator, so he will attempt to be
president, and George Bush will attempt to be president and stay
for two terms.''
</P>
<P>
   For George W., living up to his father's achievements was a
daunting proposition from the start. The elder Bush, himself the
son of a U.S. senator from Connecticut, was an academic dynamo and
baseball star at Phillips Academy and at Yale, where he was Phi
Beta Kappa, president of his fraternity, and a member of an
exclusive secret society.
</P>
<P>
   As a Navy fighter pilot in World War II, he won the
Distinguished Flying Cross after his plane was shot down southwest
of Japan.
</P>
<P>
   George W. was no scholar, no athlete and no war hero.
</P>
<P>
   He went to Andover and Yale, but his academic and athletic
careers were less than stellar. He was on the Yale baseball team,
but he warmed the bench. He distinguished himself so little in
class that professors barely remember him. During the Vietnam War,
he joined the Texas Air National Guard and flew fighter jets in his
home state.
</P>
<P>
   Like his dad, George W. was fraternity president, but his
reputation was built on an affinity for toga parties and beer. His
college years were marked by a prank that got him arrested. He was
charged with disorderly conduct for stealing a Christmas wreath
from a storefront. The charge was later dropped.
</P>
<P>
   The disobedient high jinks aside, years later he would rally to
his father's side, calling the president's 1992 loss to Bill
Clinton ''death by a thousand cuts.''
</P>
<P>
   Passionate action, even for sons who had rebelled at earlier
stages, isn't surprising, said Ken Canfield, founder and president
of the National Center for Fathering.
</P>
<P>
   ''When there's some sort of premature death, sons either kick
into higher gear ... or they can go into a very depressive state,''
he said. ''In both cases, their fathers suffering defeat, both boys
kicked in.''

<HEADLINE> Singer Ian Dury Dies at 57  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Singer Ian Dury, who rode the punk bandwagon in
the 1970s with the singles ''Hit Me With Your Rhythm Stick'' and
''Reasons to be Cheerful (Part 3),'' died Monday. He was 57.
</P>
<P>
   Dury, whose clever, exuberant, Cockney-accented lyrics were
backed by a band called the Blockheads, died after a five-year bout
with colon cancer, which spread to his liver.
</P>
<P>
   A statement from his record label, East Central One, said he
died peacefully at home with his family, with ''a smile on his
face.''
</P>
<P>
   Dury was partially crippled by polio at age 7, and he was a
lifelong campaigner for acceptance of disabilities and eradication
of polio.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his battle with cancer, he continued to work for
children's aid organizations and appear in television ads.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from school, Dury pursued a career in art as an
illustrator and teacher. It wasn't until 1970 that he turned
seriously to music, forming a group called Kilburn and the High
Roads that was characterized by Dury's wry, gravel-voiced vocals.
</P>
<P>
   The group mostly struggled for seven years, but the formation of
Ian Dury and the Blockheads in 1977 helped him finally taste
success -- even though, at 35, he was almost two decades older than
the archetypal punk rocker.
</P>
<P>
   Dury and the Blockheads were signed to independent Stiff
Records, and the group's 1977 tour with other Stiff artists,
including Elvis Costello and Nick Lowe, served as a springboard for
the so-called New Wave, a gentler, more thoughtful offshoot of
punk.
</P>
<P>
   As rock 'n' roll became ''exhausting,'' Dury segued into acting,
taking roles in movies ranging from Roman Polanski's ''Pirates'' to
Peter Greenaway's ''The Cook, The Thief, His Wife And Her Lover.''
</P>
<P>
   He also wrote a musical, ''Apples,'' that was staged at London's
Royal Court Theatre in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Among Dury's survivors are his four children -- two from his
first marriage, which ended in divorce in 1985, and two from his
second marriage to sculptress Sophie Tilson.
</P>
<P>
   Funeral arrangements were pending.

<HEADLINE> Witness Describes Bosnian Camp  </HEADLINE>
By JEROME SOCOLOVSKY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) -- A Bosnian grandmother choked with
grief as she testified Monday about the rape of her daughter and
granddaughter and vividly described a camp where Muslim women and
girls were taken into rooms and sexually assaulted each night.
</P>
<P>
   The woman, identified as witness No. 62, testified in the U.N.
war crimes tribunal trial of Bosnian Serbs Dragoljub Kunarac,
Radomir Kovac and Zoran Vukovic. The three are accused of running a
network of so-called ''rape camps'' in Foca, southeast of Sarajevo
in Bosnia-Herzegovina. All three have pleaded innocent.
</P>
<P>
   The trial, which began March 20, is the first international
prosecution of sexual enslavement. Prosecutors say the widespread
and organized rapes were intended to humiliate the women and their
families and to terrorize Muslims into flight as part of a Serb
''ethnic cleansing'' campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Serb paramilitaries backed by Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic
are accused of war crimes violations during the 3{-year war in
Bosnia, the worst carnage in Europe since World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Some 200,000 Bosnians died or are missing, hundreds of thousands
became refugees, and an estimated 20,000 women were raped during
the conflict, which formally ended with the 1995 Dayton peace
accords.
</P>
<P>
   The trial's defendants were members of the regular and
paramilitary units that in April 1992 overran Foca, where 20,000
Muslims comprised slightly more than half the prewar population of
the city. After the war, no Muslims remained and the town was
renamed Srbnje. Today, it is believed to be a hide-out for other
suspected war criminals.
</P>
<P>
   In the town, scores of women were held in a high school, a
sports hall and a construction facility and taken out nightly to be
raped and gang-raped during the summer of 1992, according to
prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Although witness 62 was apparently not raped herself, her face
and voice were scrambled on the video monitors in the public
gallery. Still, her emotional account gripped the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   When Canadian Prosecutor Dirk Ryneveld asked the woman to
confirm that her offspring were among the rape victims, the
microphone went silent for a seemingly interminable period.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm sorry,'' Ryneveld said. ''I realize this is difficult, but
I have to ask the questions. What happened to your daughter and
granddaughter?''
</P>
<P>
   ''My granddaughter was raped and mistreated,'' she replied.
</P>
<P>
   ''And your daughter?'' the prosecutor asked.
</P>
<P>
   After another long pause, the witness said: ''They did the same
thing to her.''
</P>
<P>
   The grandmother said her husband was also killed by Serb
paramilitaries, who first cut his ears off.
</P>
<P>
   She recalled how women were herded onto trucks, ''just as you
would animals,'' and shuttled from one camp to the next. At her
third stop, Partizan Gymnasium, dozens of detainees were forced to
sleep on a wooden floor with no blankets. To eat, they would
occasionally get a broth, which she described as ''dishwater in a
jar, some swill.''
</P>
<P>
   Although most victims were raped in separate rooms and
apartments, the witness remembered one night when three men entered
the darkened sports hall and roused the woman sleeping beside her.
One of them raped the woman in front of her 10-year-old son and the
rest of the detainees, the witness said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He tore her clothes off and she cried, 'Please don't! Please
don't!'' the witness told the court. ''But he lifted up her legs
and continued for an hour.''
</P>
<P>
   In another trial, prosecutors Monday called a Dutch peacekeeper
to the witness stand to testify about the massacre of thousands of
Muslims at Srebrenica in the trial of Gen. Radislav Krstic, the
Bosnian Serb commander accused of ordering Europe's worst war crime
since the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav war crimes tribunal was set up by the U.N. Security
Council in 1993. It has delivered sentences of up to 45 years
against 14 commanders and subordinates from Serb, Croat and Muslim
forces in the Bosnia war.

<HEADLINE> Elian May Not Accept Mom's Death  </HEADLINE>
By ALEX VEIGA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- As his relatives filed a court appeal today to meet
a government deadline, Elian Gonzalez described in his first TV
interview how the boat bringing him and his mother from Cuba sank.
He said he doesn't believe his mother is dead.
</P>
<P>
   Also today, about 100 people gathered outside the Little Havana
home where the 6-year-old boy has been staying. The Democracy
Movement, a Cuban exile group, has called for people to form a
human chain around the home of Elian's great-uncle in case the
government tries to remove him and send him back to his father in
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Elian was kept home today and won't return to school out of
fears that Cuba might try to force him back to the island, family
spokesman Armando Gutierrez said.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview broadcast on ABC's ''Good Morning America,''
Elian drew crayon pictures of the voyage in which his mother and 10
other people drowned.
</P>
<P>
   He first drew a wavy line representing waves, then a leaping
dolphin -- he has told people that dolphins protected him from
sharks and boosted him up when he slipped down into the water from
an inner tube.
</P>
<P>
   He drew himself as a stick figure on the inner tube, and then
sketched a boat with people inside. He told of the boat having
engine trouble and slowly sinking, and of attempts to bail it out.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what happened to the boat, he said softly: ''Water came
in.''
</P>
<P>
   He drew the waves higher and higher, covering the boat.
</P>
<P>
   Elian insisted his mother survived.
</P>
<P>
   ''My mother is not in heaven, not lost,'' he said in Spanish
through his cousin Marisleysis Gonzalez, who is raising him. ''She
must have been picked up here in Miami somewhere. She must have
lost her memory, and just doesn't know I'm here.''
</P>
<P>
   Marisleysis Gonzalez gently reminded him that he knows what
really happened to his mother, and he gazed downward.
</P>
<P>
   In the segment, the first of three planned for broadcast this
week, he wasn't asked whether he wanted to return to his father in
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Facing a noon deadline, Elian's Florida relatives filed a motion
for an expedited appeals process to sort out the international
custody dispute.
</P>
<P>
   The motion asks the federal appeals court to set a schedule for
arguments in the family's appeal of a federal judge's ruling
affirming the INS decision to return Elian to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   A judge could set the schedule as early as this week, court
officials said. It could be weeks before the case is resolved.
</P>
<P>
   ''The court of appeals is in the best situation to determine
what is fair and what this appeal needs to be heard fairly, not the
Department of Justice,'' attorney Linda Osberg-Braun told reporters
this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Osberg-Braun said Elian's relatives had also agreed to comply
with a Justice Department demand asking them to turn over the boy
to the Immigration and Naturalization Service if the family loses
its appeal and fails to obtain a stay of the INS order from the
Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government had no immediate response to the filing
in the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   In an apparent bid to increase American support for their battle
to keep Elian, the Miami relatives last week allowed ABC's Diane
Sawyer to spend two days with the boy. Elian's father, who was
divorced from the boy's mother, is fighting for his return.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Elian said he remembers his mother placing him
on an inner tube and that he fell asleep. Fishermen later found him
lashed to the inner tube floating off the Florida coast.
</P>
<P>
   Since his arrival last November, Elian has been under the
constant glare of cameras, typically seen playing in the front yard
of his great-uncle's home or walking to school, but the ABC
interview was the first time he had directly talked to the media.
</P>
<P>
   Mindful of Elian's age and the ordeal he went through, ABC
arranged for a Spanish-speaking child psychiatrist with no prior
connection to the case to accompany Sawyer.
</P>
<P>
   In the segment broadcast today, Elian sprayed Sawyer with
streams of colorful sticky foam and reminded her repeatedly to
clean up the mess. He also gave out an emphatic ''No!'' when Sawyer
tried to clip or touch one of his teacher's flowers.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech Sunday in Havana, Cuban President Fidel Castro said
subjecting Elian to the interview was ''monstrous and sickening.''
</P>
<P>
   ''You cannot do this without the authorization of the father,''
Castro said. ''I sincerely think that this boy is at risk in the
hands of desperate people and the government of the United States
should not be running this risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Castro confidently declared that Elian's Miami relatives had run
out of legal challenges.
</P>
<P>
   But he warned that, rather than allow the boy's return, Elian's
Miami supporters, Cuban-American exiles, might kill the child or
take him to a third country.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are capable of killing him rather than returning him safe
and sound to the country,'' Castro said as he wrapped up a one-hour
speech.

   HUDSON FALLS, N.Y. (AP) -- Kim Bishop gazed into the big, brown
eyes of her 3-year-old daughter, Cheyenne, with a sense of fear
over what the future may hold.
</P>
<P>
   Just hours earlier, Cheyenne's doctor had told the family some
unsettling news.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since Cheyenne lay almost lifeless in a
hospital bed last fall battling deadly E. coli poisoning, blood
tests indicated her impaired kidneys might be getting worse rather
than continuing to recover.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly seven months ago, Scott and Kim Bishop took Cheyenne,
their only child, to the Washington County Fair in Easton to see
the animals and enjoy a spin on the kiddy rides.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, Aug. 29, was a hot day, and Cheyenne wanted a soda. So
the family stopped at a concession booth and had several sodas.
</P>
<P>
   Little did the Bishops know that the water mixed into food and
drinks that day contained a deadly strain of E. coli. In the days
that followed, the virulent bacteria killed two people, sickened
more than 1,000 and brought about a dozen children close to death.
</P>
<P>
   Cheyenne was among them. Her mother was also a victim.
</P>
<P>
   While people flocked to hospitals, researchers worked around the
clock to identify what was sickening so many.
</P>
<P>
   The state Health Department determined that rain water had
washed through cow manure, seeping into a well that supplied water
to food vendors. The incident unfolded as the nation's second-worst
E. coli epidemic, most severely affecting about a dozen children.
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks that followed the fair, the E. coli bacteria
multiplied in Cheyenne's bloodstream, spewing out a toxin that ate
away at her capillaries and attacked her vital organs.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the Bishops and their parents gathered in Scott and
Kim's living room and recalled how their family nightmare had
unfolded.
</P>
<P>
   Kim was the first to experience the initial symptoms of the
poisoning: nausea, cramps, vomiting and diarrhea, which started on
the Tuesday after the fair visit and became worse each day. She was
hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, Cheyenne showed mild symptoms of cramps and
diarrhea.
</P>
<P>
   Cheyenne was in bed with her grandmother, Mary Bishop, when the
symptoms turned serious.
</P>
<P>
   ''Cheyenne threw up, then she had dry heaves. She was so hungry
and thirsty, but she couldn't keep anything down,'' Mary recalled.
''She couldn't swallow anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott took his child to the Glens Falls Hospital emergency room,
where she was later admitted.
</P>
<P>
   That night and every night in the following days, Scott, his
parents and Kim's mother kept a bedside vigil beside Kim and
Cheyenne.
</P>
<P>
   While the mother improved and was released, Cheyenne grew
increasingly ill and weak.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors decided Cheyenne needed a catheter, and inserting it
took four hospital employees to hold her down, Mary remembered.
</P>
<P>
   But the worst was yet to come.
</P>
<P>
   At about 8 p.m. on the second Thursday after the fair visit,
doctors decided Cheyenne needed the specialized care at Albany
Medical Center. Crying relatives kissed her goodbye. Aides set her
on a gurney and wheeled her down a hallway, Kim remembered.
</P>
<P>
   ''She was hysterical, screaming and crying, yelling for Mommy
and Daddy, wondering where she was going,'' Bishop said. ''She was
very scared.''
</P>
<P>
   Hours later, Cheyenne was at Albany Medical Center's pediatric
ward alongside a dozen other children sickened by the E. coli
epidemic, the first mass poisoning incident of its nature for the
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The Bishops didn't know the anguish that lay ahead.
</P>
<P>
   One of the children was an 8-year-old girl who was screaming in
pain for well over two hours. Kim complained to the nurses, and
they said there was nothing they could do.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, doctors can do very little about the deadly 0157:H7
strain of E. coli. Antibiotics can increase the toxins in the
patient's bloodstream by killing off the friendly strains of
bacteria that can help the digestive system shed the deadly strain.
</P>
<P>
   Pain killers also make things worse. Plenty of fluids are
helpful in mild cases. Children, most vulnerable to the poisoning,
were put on dialysis to cleanse their blood of the poison, and were
given transfusions.
</P>
<P>
   For 10 days or more, teams of doctors and nurses rushed medical
equipment from one room to another to meet crisis after crisis,
family members recalled.
</P>
<P>
   They not only dealt with the E. coli poisoning, but
complications and secondary infections.
</P>
<P>
   The nights were tough, Scott said. He would sleep on a cot or on
the floor beside Cheyenne, and listen to her cries -- and the
screams from other children -- intermittently all night long.
Sometimes the screams would be simply for a glass of water, he
said, which was restricted when they were on dialysis.

<P>
   On one night, as other children were battling low blood pressure
and shrunken veins, Cheyenne's blood pressure soared and her
temperature rose to 105.9, Kim's mother, Linda Robitaille, said.
Cheyenne was throwing up medicine and bleeding through the nose.
</P>
<P>
   ''At first we were taking it one day at a time, but later, we
were dealing with it just one hour at a time,'' Robitaille said.
</P>
<P>
   Cheyenne's follow-up care included three weeks of dialysis and
biweekly blood tests. Her kidneys steadily improved, although one
is still operating at only 30 percent efficiency, Scott said.
</P>
<P>
   Cheyenne now follows a low-sodium, low-phosphorous,
low-potassium diet. Tomatoes, bananas, potatoes, oranges,
chocolate, dairy products and other foods are either forbidden or
restricted for Cheyenne and others with impaired kidneys.
</P>
<P>
   Kidneys excrete growth hormones and permanent kidney impairment
may mean future problems for Cheyenne, Robitaille said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Before this happened, Cheyenne was such a healthy girl, and
now we don't know if she'll grow to a normal size,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides a weakened immune system, which had led to infections
and flu in the past several months, there is continuing concern
about whether Cheyenne will someday need a kidney transplant to
lead a normal life and have children, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Bishop said after the initial media attention over E. coli
subsided, many people may have believed the problems were over.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not over, and everybody's not well yet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Bishops have filed a lawsuit on behalf of Cheyenne and Kim.
The Bishops' lawyer, William Nikas, said the fair organizers,
Washington County and the state should have taken measures to
assure the water's safety.

<HEADLINE> Bonuses Pit Teacher Against Teacher  </HEADLINE>
By CHRISTOPHER NEWTON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) -- Eighth-grade English teacher Brian P.
Gallagher does not want the $2,500 bonus his school district is
offering if his students improve their standardized test scores.
</P>
<P>
   He says the whole idea is more trouble than it is worth.
</P>
<P>
   His students are razzing him, wisecracking about how they hold
his financial fate in their hands.
</P>
<P>
   And since the Colonial School District's plan allows only 20
percent of the teachers to get the extra cash, his colleagues are
becoming reluctant to share teaching tips, he says.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition is so strong that nearly all of Colonial's 350
teachers have signed a petition saying they will give any bonus
money to charity.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, schools in Denver, and now Pennsylvania, have
approved bonus plans to improve education. But many teachers -- and
the nation's two largest teachers unions -- are suspicious of the
idea.
</P>
<P>
   ''Unfortunately, this has become the misguided panacea du jour --
put teachers in a competitive situation and they'll work harder,''
said Darrell Capwell, a spokesman for the American Federation of
Teachers, with more than 1 million members. ''What people who talk
about bonuses don't seem to understand is that there are so many
forces outside of the teachers' control that influence test scores.
A better thing to do is to use the money to hire another teacher or
build more classrooms to support smaller class sizes.''
</P>
<P>
   Capwell said the bonus plan takes the familial relationship
teachers have with students and threatens to replace it with a
harsher, more corporate-like atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   The National Education Association, which represents 2.5 million
teachers, has not yet taken a stand on the issue but plans to
discuss bonuses at a meeting July 4 in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have some very serious concerns about the idea, but we're
not ready to throw water on it completely,'' said NEA spokeswoman
Kathleen Lyons. ''We believe there may be some forms of bonuses
that we could support.''
</P>
<P>
   Some districts around the country have offered merit increases
or bonuses, but they base the decision on schoolwide achievement or
factors such as a teacher's work outside the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   The Denver and Colonial School District programs, in contrast,
would reward teachers for how well the children do in their
individual classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Denver's program, approved last fall, is a four-year experiment
that involves a small group of teachers. The teachers will receive
$1,500 if students improve on a basic skills test.
</P>
<P>
   The Colonial School District, an affluent district in
Norristown, near Philadelphia, is the first to institute a bonus
program open to all teachers. Unlike the Denver plan, it forces
teachers to compete against each other for the money. Teachers will
receive their first bonuses in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Colonial school board member Tom Yunker defended the competitive
nature of the program.
</P>
<P>
   ''If it works to encourage teachers to work harder to get their
students to score better, that is great. If it encourages teachers
to come up with new ways to help their students, that is also
great,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This bonus program is specifically designed so that it is not
a raise for everyone or a reward for everyone. We want to reward
those who stand apart from their peers,'' he added. ''If we just
gave the money to everyone, we would not be encouraging anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Teachers in the 4,700-student district make an average of
$62,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the money for the bonuses comes from the state Education
Department, where officials have been vocal supporters of the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sure there is going to be an element of competition, but
teachers should embrace it rather than run from it,'' said Michelle
Biddle, department spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Gallagher said teachers signed the petition in the belief the
bonus program is unfair. For one thing, he said, some teachers have
students who come from different backgrounds and face different
challenges.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a plan that compares apples to oranges on several
levels and then tries to change classroom instruction based on
it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Angelica Victor, a spokeswoman for Education Alliance, a
Washington-based group that represents education researchers at
universities, said the experiments in Denver and at Colonial are
being closely watched, and the outcome will help determine the
idea's future elsewhere around the country.
</P>
<P>
   ''Will it make a difference on test scores and student
performance without wreaking havoc among teachers? These programs
will provide hard data either way,'' Victor said.

<HEADLINE> Chechen Officials Deny Voter Fraud  </HEADLINE>
By LYOMA TURPALOV, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   GROZNY, Russia (AP) -- Small rebel bands attacked Russian posts
in Chechnya on Monday, and Russian jets bombed rebel targets in
areas the military had claimed to control, indicating weaknesses in
the Russians' grip on the republic.
</P>
<P>
   The attacks came despite heightened security for Russia's
presidential election Sunday, and cast doubt on the military's
claim to control most of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Rebels shot grenades at a police checkpoint near Urus-Martan, 12
miles southwest of the Chechen capital Grozny, drawing Russian
fire, the ITAR-Tass news agency quoted the military command as
saying. Snipers also attacked a police headquarters in Urus-Martan.
</P>
<P>
   Militants also ambushed a police checkpoint in Shali, 16 miles
southeast of Grozny, ITAR-Tass said. No casualty information was
available.
</P>
<P>
   Russian jets flew more than 90 attack sorties in the past 24
hours, the federal command said Monday. The jets targeted the towns
of Samashki, Roshni-Chu and Elistanzhi, all in Russian-held areas.
</P>
<P>
   The heaviest fighting recently has been in the southern
mountains, where hundreds of rebels are based, but smaller clashes
have been reported in the Russian-held northern flatlands.
</P>
<P>
   The military claimed Monday to have 1,500 rebels trapped in the
village of Tsentoroi, 30 miles southeast of Grozny. It maintained
no fighting had begun but said Russian troops were preparing for
battle.
</P>
<P>
   Only a small part of the votes in the presidential election had
been counted in Chechnya by Monday, but preliminary results
indicated nationwide winner Vladimir Putin received 40 percent of
the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Putin was followed by Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov with 32
percent, said Sergei Yastrzhembsky, the presidential spokesman on
Chechnya. Nationwide, Putin won more than 52 percent of the vote,
to Zyuganov's 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Placing third in Chechnya was ethnic Chechen Umar Dzhabrailov, a
Moscow businessman. He got 12.7 percent in Chechnya, but less than
1 percent nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials and the head of Chechnya's electoral
commission, Abdul-Kerim Arsakhanov, denied any foul play. But some
election officials suggested the results could have been rigged in
Putin's favor.
</P>
<P>
   Some Chechens interviewed in refugee camps in neighboring
Ingushetia reported coercion by Russian troops to vote for Putin.
</P>
<P>
   Streets in Chechen towns and cities were bare on election day,
with few voters going to the polls. But Yastrzhembsky said in
Moscow that turnout in the republic was 65 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Officials reported only two polling station incidents. A bomb
was defused at a polling station in the eastern village of
Engel-Yurt, and a grenade launcher was fired at a polling station
in the town of Argun, east of Grozny, Yastrzhembsky said. Nobody
was injured.
</P>
<P>
   ''The main thing is that despite the multiple threats and risks,
the election took place,'' Yastrzhembsky said. ''For the first time
in many years, the citizens of Chechnya alongside with the Russians
took part in an electoral process.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton congratulated Putin on Monday, but used the
opportunity to express U.S. dismay over the situation in ravaged
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Clinton said he stressed the U.S. view that
Russia must launch ''investigations of reported human rights
violations'' in Chechnya, and allow full access to the region for
international relief organizations and the press.
</P>
<P>
   Chechnya won de facto independence after a 1994-6 war that ended
in a humiliating withdrawal for Russian troops. Russian forces
entered Chechnya again last September, after rebels invaded the
neighboring Russian region of Dagestan.

<HEADLINE> Broiled eel, crown prince and besuboru? It must be opening day  </HEADLINE>
By BEN WALKER, AP Baseball Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Buy me some peanuts and Cracker Jack ... but leave
room for the broiled eel.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to go global, major league baseball takes on an
international flavor this week when the New York Mets and Chicago
Cubs start the season at the Tokyo Dome.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the game has never looked -- or tasted -- quite like
this.
</P>
<P>
   Crown Prince Naruhito in the royal box. Two rows of benches in
each dugout. Beer girls dressed in fluorescent green in the stands.
Fans wearing surgical masks in the seats so as not to spread germs.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think opening day is always opening day, no matter where it
is,'' Mets catcher Mike Piazza said.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, but no one ever saw an opposing player bow to the crowd
at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Come Wednesday night, when 1 billion yen-a-year star Sammy Sosa
strolls to the plate in the first inning, that could happen. Of
course, a whole lot of people back home would probably miss it.
</P>
<P>
   The first pitch is scheduled for 7:08 p.m. local time at the
ballpark known as the ''Big Egg'' -- that's 5:08 a.m. EST Wednesday
in New York and 4:08 a.m. CST in Chicago. Fox Sports Net is
televising the game for anyone who's awake at that hour.
</P>
<P>
   ''No, I don't think I'll be up that early,'' Chicago White Sox
star Frank Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet that was part of the deal, Cubs president Andy MacPhail
said.
</P>
<P>
   When the NFL, NBA and NHL ventured to Tokyo, they adjusted
starting times to fit audiences in North America. Baseball,
however, did not want to disrupt Japanese schedules for the first
regular-season games outside the continent, hoping to build better
relations in pursuit of its ultimate goal -- a true World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ''When we agreed to play, we knew there would be certain
inconveniences,'' MacPhail said. ''There are tradeoffs involved.
And we believed it was appropriate, given the direction we are
taking baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's completely the wrong way, contended St. Louis slugger
Mark McGwire. The Cardinals originally were picked for the 20-hour
trip and turned it down last summer, led by Big Mac's opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Japanese have their own brand of baseball,'' he said.
''Our game is too international as it is. It comes down to how much
money can they make.''
</P>
<P>
   True, there have been a few concessions to the country crazy
about the sport it calls ''besuboru.''
</P>
<P>
   Piazza's jersey had a patch on the right shoulder for the AIU
insurance company that is sponsoring the two Mets-Cubs games.
Sosa's batting helmet carried the logo of the AM-PM market chain
that is promoting the matchup.
</P>
<P>
   ''If this was sheer greed, this wouldn't be worth it,''
commissioner Bud Selig insisted. ''Economics are a secondary
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, the players are making out OK. They're all getting
$25,000 each for the games -- which count in the standings -- and
most got to fly in first class.
</P>
<P>
   They've also had the chance to enjoy Japanese culture, be it
seeing the Imperial Palace or kabuki theater, watching sumo
wrestling on TV or shopping in the famous Ginza district.
</P>
<P>
   To help adjust to the jet lag, the teams will get three days off
after leaving Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't see this being as big a deal as other people are
making it,'' said Mets first baseman Todd Zeile, who brought along
his camcorder.
</P>
<P>
   So while other clubs are still in spring training at places such
as Vero Beach, Clearwater and Tempe, a bunch of Mets went out for a
dinner of Kobe steaks.
</P>
<P>
   They would have found stranger fare at the Tokyo Dome.
</P>
<P>
   There's sushi, naturally, and the popular eel bento box -- cooked
eel surrounded by odd-colored side dishes. There's sake and hot
tea, too.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, there are hot dogs, albeit no Dodger dogs or Fenway
franks. Plus peanuts, although they come in a mix with rice and
crackers. Noodles and squid also sell well.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers expect a sellout crowd of 50,000, with the top seats
going for about $115. The attendance will be announced as 55,000,
however, because that's the tradition at this ballpark ruled by the
Tokyo Yomiuri Giants.
</P>
<P>
   There are lots of unusual traditions in Japanese ball, actually.
</P>
<P>
   Players normally do not sign autographs -- and they get paid for
postgame interviews. Home-run hitters are immediately presented
with a large doll, which they often throw into the stands.
</P>
<P>
   Ceremonial first balls are thrown out with the visiting team's
leadoff man in the batter's box. There is no standard league ball,
either -- each team has its own, all smaller than those used in
North America.
</P>
<P>
   The treatment of umpires varies as well.
</P>
<P>
   Umps in Japan are routinely pushed around without penalty. And
there's no trace of arrogance -- last season, umpire Toshiyuki
Tanaka suspended himself for three games for blowing a call.
</P>
<P>
   ''That shows you the difference right there,'' said Marty
Foster, one of the four major league umpires who will work the
Mets-Cubs series. ''I don't think you'd see that back home.''

<HEADLINE> Existing-Home Sales Rose Last Month  </HEADLINE>
By JEANNINE AVERSA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Feeling prosperous, Americans pushed up sales
of existing homes in February after two consecutive months of
declines caused in part by higher mortgage rates.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of existing single-family homes bounced back by a modest
6.7 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.75
million units, the National Association of Realtors said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   With plentiful jobs, rising incomes, stock market gains and low
inflation, Americans are feeling wealthy and in a mood to buy
despite an upswing in mortgage rates, economists said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The higher interest rate story is being overridden by the
amount of wealth potential homeowners have amassed,'' said
economist Richard Yamarone of Argus Research Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve last week raised interest rates for the
fifth time since June 30, making borrowing more expensive for
millions of consumers and businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed did this to slow the red-hot economy and keep inflation
under control. Given continuing strong growth, many economists
believe the central bank will boost interest rates again on May 16.
</P>
<P>
   The average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was 8.33
percent in February, up from 8.21 percent the month before. In
February 1999, the average rate on a 30-year mortgage was 6.81
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fact sales improved in the face of continuing increases in
mortgage interest rates demonstrates the very high demand for
housing in the United States,'' said Dennis Cronk, president of the
Realtors association.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the gain, however, February's sales are 7.6 percent
lower than the 5.14 million-unit sales rate posted in February
1999.
</P>
<P>
   In January, existing-home sales fell 13.4 percent, sharper than
previously reported. Economists had blamed the earlier-reported
higher mortgage rates and a record low 2.6-month supply of homes
available to sell in January. In December, existing-home sales
dropped by 0.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The stock of existing homes for sale rose in February but
remained at a low 2.8 months, meaning it would take 2.8 months to
exhaust the supply at February's sales pace.
</P>
<P>
   ''The extremely low inventory of homes for resale is undoubtedly
playing a major role in the trend of lower sales,'' said First
Union's chief economist David Orr. ''It is still a seller's
market.''
</P>
<P>
   Economists expect home sales to slow this year but still remain
at healthy levels.
</P>
<P>
   The National Association of Realtors is projecting sales to
total 4.74 million units in 2000. While that would mark the
third-highest sales on record, it would represent an 8.7 percent
drop from the all-time high of 5.20 million sold last year.
</P>
<P>
   By region, the South saw existing-home sales rise 10.7 percent
last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.97 million
units.
</P>
<P>
   In the West, sales rose 8.7 percent to a rate of 1.12 million
units, and in the Midwest they grew by 5.7 percent to a rate of
1.12 million units. But sales fell 6.9 percent in the Northeast to
a rate of 540,000 units.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the median existing-home sales price, meaning half
sold for more and half for less, was $131,100 last month. That was
0.8 percent lower than January's median price but was 2.3 percent
higher than the median price recorded for February 1999.

<HEADLINE> Judge To Rule on Reform Party Head  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE KELLMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Whoever emerges as the head of the Reform
Party, federal election officials say he needs to keep the
government better informed of where the organization's millions of
taxpayer dollars are kept.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, U.S. District Judge Norman K. Moon was picking
between two rivals claiming to be the legitimate chairman of the
party: Jack Gargan, who was ousted last month during a rowdy party
meeting in Nashville, Tenn., and the man who took his place, Pat
Choate, the 1996 running mate of party founder Ross Perot.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly $2.5 million in public money that was granted the third
party for its nominating convention was not stored in the
Martinsville, Va., bank that party officers had named in their
application for the funding, according to an advisory brief filed
with the judge by the Federal Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
   According to court documents, most of the money was spread among
at least four bank accounts from Virginia to Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ''The court should ... order the prevailing parties to provide
the commission with notice of any changes in the information
provided in its application for federal funds,'' including where
the money has been deposited, the FEC said in its March 21 brief.
</P>
<P>
   The FEC urged Moon to not only pick a Reform Party chairman but
to state specifically who should be in charge of the federal
funding. In addition, the agency suggested that Moon require the
prevailing officers to agree in writing to keep the FEC apprised of
the money's whereabouts as a condition of receiving it.
</P>
<P>
   As for the two would-be chairmen, Gargan contends that the
Nashville meeting was convened illegally and that the vote to oust
him and install Choate was invalid.
</P>
<P>
   Choate, meanwhile, argues that Gargan's refusal to step down and
his continuing claim to the chairmanship is hurting the party's
ability to make a meaningful White House bid.
</P>
<P>
   The chairmanship aside, the departure of the party's
highest-ranking elected leader, Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura, and
the void created by Perot's absence have left the party a patchwork
of state organizations caught up in a variety of fights waged in
courtrooms and cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas billionaire and two-time presidential candidate
refused Monday to comment on the suit or answer questions about
whether he plans to jump into the race and compete for his party's
nomination against former Republican Pat Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I'm ready to say something, I'll let you all know,''
Perot said, following a speech to the Federation of American Health
Systems in Dallas. In that speech, Perot blamed Medicare, the
federal health program for the elderly, for failing to change
enough since its inception more than 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan, meanwhile, is being sued by New Hampshire Reform Party
Chairman John Talbott, who says the conservative columnist is
illegally using the party's name and trying to elect his own
convention delegates at a meeting in Manchester on Saturday.

<HEADLINE> U.S. May Buy Sugar Surplus  </HEADLINE>
By PHILIP BRASHER, AP Farm Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Got a sweet tooth? Uncle Sam wants you! The
government is thinking of buying 250,000 tons of surplus sugar to
pump up its domestic price. But then what will officials do with
all that sugar, enough to fill up two-thirds of the Empire State
Building?
</P>
<P>
   One idea is to donate it overseas, although no country has
indicated any interest in it. Another is to sell it at a deep
discount for refining into ethanol, a gasoline additive usually
made from corn. Whatever course is taken, taxpayers could get stuck
with a $100 million tab.
</P>
<P>
   The problem stems from a government program that guarantees U.S.
growers a minimum price for their sugar. Until now, the Agriculture
Department has managed to keep domestic sugar prices three times
higher than the world price simply by regulating supplies. But the
department is fast losing control of the situation because of
bumper domestic crops and rising imports.
</P>
<P>
   Prices that farmers get for sugar have dropped 25 percent since
last year, and growers are threatening to forfeit to the government
as much as $550 million worth of sugar that was pledged as
collateral on federal marketing loans.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a mess,'' said Dan Colacicco, a senior Agriculture
Department analyst.
</P>
<P>
   Economists say the forfeitures are a virtual certainty unless
USDA buys some sugar to boost the domestic price.
</P>
<P>
   ''The situation is dire,'' said Mark Weber, executive director
of the Red River Valley Sugarbeet Growers Association in Fargo,
N.D.
</P>
<P>
   ''Certainly there will be critics,'' Weber added. ''We've had
critics for a long time against sugar policy, and they'll use this
to poke us in the eye.''
</P>
<P>
   The sugar program normally doesn't cost the government anything.
But it's still controversial because it increases costs for candy
and breakfast cereal makers -- and ultimately consumers -- while
benefitting large sugar cane farms in Florida, Louisiana and Texas.
</P>
<P>
   It's also frequently cited as an example of American
protectionism when U.S. negotiators try to persuade other countries
to lower their trade barriers.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the sugar program are urging USDA to let sugar
prices fall. The farmers ''contributed to the current oversupply
and should cope with the problem on their own,'' the Consumer
Federation of America said in a letter to Agriculture Secretary Dan
Glickman.
</P>
<P>
   The government guarantees farmers a minimum price for domestic
sugar through the loan program and quotas on imports. Growers who
put their sugar up as collateral for a federal loan have the right
to forfeit the crop to the government if prices fall below the
guaranteed price.
</P>
<P>
   Since the early 1980s, USDA has avoided any such forfeitures by
keeping imports low enough to stabilize domestic prices. But now
U.S. production is expanding -- up 25 percent from 1997 -- as farmers
switch to growing sugar from less lucrative crops. Meanwhile,
imports are also increasing, especially from Mexico, because of
U.S. obligations under international trade agreements.
</P>
<P>
   About 1.3 million tons of sugar are now under government loan
and subject to forfeiture. The first forfeitures could begin in
July. Prices for raw cane sugar are expected to be about 19 cents a
pound then, more than 4 cents below the rate at which USDA expects
forfeitures.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. growers say food and candy makers are profiting from the
lower prices at the farmers' expense.
</P>
<P>
   ''Prices this low are a terrible financial blow to me and my
family,'' said Everett Gabel, who farms 240 acres of sugarbeets
near Billings, Mont. ''It would be some consolation to us if this
low producer price meant lower sugar and sweetened product prices
at the grocery store, but it does not.''
</P>
<P>
   Glickman hasn't said what, if anything, he is going to do.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think there's anything we can do in this situation to
avoid costs'' to taxpayers, said Colacicco, the USDA analyst.
''There's far too much sugar out there.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Plans Legislative Push  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton, convinced that Republican
leaders in Congress are out of step with the country, is
capitalizing on what aides see as a rare chance to make inroads on
gun control, Medicare reform and other issues -- or at least to make
those issues work for Al Gore in November.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Clinton plans to chart his legislative agenda for
the coming months. Aides describe his speech as more policy than
politics, but politics is the linchpin for what the White House
views as an election year offering an unusual shot at enacting
legislation important to the president and popular with voters.
Usually, controversial matters have scant chance of enactment as a
national election approaches.
</P>
<P>
   By stoking public pressure for popular ideas such as adding a
prescription drug benefit to Medicare, the White House hopes either
to force GOP leaders to negotiate or to execute an end run with the
help of moderate Republicans and those facing tough re-election
fights this fall.
</P>
<P>
   On the flip side, Democratic candidates may be able to
capitalize in the fall if the GOP should thwart these ideas,
presidential aides said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think they don't want to just be seen as a Congress that
can't produce any real work on behalf of the American people,''
White House chief of staff John Podesta said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   The current Congress has little to show for itself so far and
has a reputation for partisan rancor, Podesta said.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're going to have to think about whether they want to run
for re-election carrying that,'' Podesta said. ''We think there is
some leverage, and the president will bring that to bear.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican strategists say the White House simply is trying to
gain partisan advantage and provide legislative footing for Vice
President Gore's presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're not really trying to improve or better people's lives.
They're trying to create campaign commercials,'' said John
Czwartacki, spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's strategy of public pressure will be applied to all the
main pieces of domestic legislation on his wish list this spring,
aides said.
</P>
<P>
   That list includes a ''patients' bill of rights'' for managed
care patients; reform of the Medicare system; the drug benefit; new
gun control laws; and campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   On several of these issues, ''there are actually bipartisan
majorities in either the House or the Senate, and the only thing
holding it up in one place or the other is that the Republican
leadership has not relented,'' White House adviser Joel Johnson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is taking a different tack with his push for a new trade
deal with China. In that fight, the White House is allied with most
Republicans and against many Democrats, labor unions and
environmental and human rights groups.
</P>
<P>
   In the months leading to the Republican and Democratic
conventions this summer, Clinton plans to hammer GOP leaders'
commitment to large tax cuts and opposition to new gun control,
aides said.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders have their own versions of minimum wage
legislation and other issues. They hope to deny campaign fodder to
Gore, help presumptive GOP presidential nominee George W. Bush and
hold on to their majority.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the White House hears whispers of Republican dissent.
</P>
<P>
   The House cast a symbolic 218-205 vote this month in favor of
moving ahead on gun control. And two Republicans in difficult
re-election races attended a White House pep rally for the Clinton
gun control agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Brian Bilbray, R-Calif., who stood prominently beside
Clinton at the rally, said bipartisan support exists for several
Clinton priorities, but the president must be willing to
compromise.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot will depend on how much he wants these things for his
legacy,'' Bilbray said.
</P>
<P>
   The other Republican at the event was Rep. Jim Rogan, R-Calif.,
one of the House managers who laid out the impeachment case against
Clinton in the Senate last year.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has said he is eager to accomplish big things in his
last year in office. But Stephen Hess, presidential analyst at the
Brookings Institution, sees little reason for White House optimism
in this election year.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you look at what the Republicans are proposing in their
budget and what the president is proposing in his, they still look
like different worlds,'' Hess said.

<HEADLINE> German Auto Mergers Sign of Times  </HEADLINE>
By HANS GREIMEL, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- Alliances unveiled Monday by
DaimlerChrysler AG and Volkswagen AG take Europe's two largest
automakers in opposite directions but fulfill the same goal --
rounding out their product lines to stay alive in the latest round
of global consolidation.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler shelled out $2 billion for a 34 percent stake in
Japan's Mitsubishi Motors Corp., giving the German automaker new
inroads in Asia but also the technical edge needed to push its new
line of smaller, more fuel efficient cars.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Volkswagen, known for subcompact hits like the Beetle,
filled in a big gap as it laid out $1.6 billion for a controlling
stake in Swedish bus and truck maker Scania AB. That gives the
German passenger car giant an outlet for making anything with more
four or more wheels -- from cheap cars for first-time buyers to
40-ton cargo-hauling trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Both deals give the companies something they each have long
sought, a well-rounded product line capable of an international
reach and the depth needed to ride out slumps in business cycles.
</P>
<P>
   ''With the giant footprint of this group in the worldwide
automotive market, we're now where we always wanted to be,''
DaimlerChrysler chairman Juergen Schrempp said in announcing the
Mitsubishi deal at a news conference Monday in Frankfurt. ''I'd
like to say another acquisition isn't necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler shares finished down 0.2 percent at 70.05 euros
($67) in Frankfurt trading, while shares of Mitsubishi rose 12
percent in trading in Tokyo to close at 470 yen ($4.40)
</P>
<P>
   Volkswagen finished up 1.35 percent to 45.10 euros ($43.75),
while U.S. shares of Scania were up $1.25 to $30 on the New York
Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   In a world where few merger candidates still exist, companies
such as DaimlerChrysler and Volkswagen are racing to pair off with
weaker players -- building global auto empires at the same time they
offer smaller companies a parent company with deep pockets.
</P>
<P>
   Scania will be looking to Volkswagen for its expertise in
marketing and purchasing, only weeks after a deal with Volvo fell
through. Authorities shot down Volvo's bid for its smaller rival
Scania, saying it would give Volvo a stranglehold on the
Scandinavian market.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the DaimlerChrysler deal buoys debt-ridden Mitsubishi
with an infusion of badly needed cash as the troubled automaker
digs its way out of 1.75 trillion yen ($16.4 billion) in debt.
</P>
<P>
   But more importantly, it catapults DaimlerChrysler to the No. 3
spot in world automaking behind General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor
Co., and gives it a leg up in small, mass volume cars -- the
Mercedes-maker's traditional Achilles' heel.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say the move was crucial for positioning
DaimlerChrysler to cash in on the growing demand for small cars in
the developing markets of Asia and Latin America -- not to mention
Europe, where tight European Union fuel efficiency standards are
pressuring automakers to clean up their engines or pay heavy fines.
</P>
<P>
   ''All cars will have to develop small, cleaner engines in the
near future and that's where DaimlerChrysler stands to benefit
because Mitsubishi has proven expertise there,'' said Mark Little,
an auto analyst with Deutsche Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Mitsubishi is bringing its pioneering gasoline direct injection
technology to the table. That's an area where the company has
failed to exploit its leadership and could benefit from
DaimlerChrysler's vast resources, deep pockets and technical
know-how, analysts said.

<HEADLINE> Firefighter To Help Epileptic Rower  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONOLULU (AP) -- A freighter is leaving Tuesday to bring food and
medicine to Andrew Halsey, who is trying to become the first
epileptic to row alone across the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Halsey left San Diego in July in a 27-foot rowboat on
what was expected to be an eight-month, 7,500-mile trip to Sydney,
Australia.
</P>
<P>
   But after missing favorable weather patterns early on, he was
swept back and forth off the Mexican coast for months.
</P>
<P>
   Although Halsey now is making better progress, backers fear his
food and medical supplies are getting low. The 42-year-old former
bricklayer is prone to severe seizures.
</P>
<P>
   Halsey was estimated to be 1,200 miles south of Hawaii and 980
miles east of Christmas Island.
</P>
<P>
   A 180-foot freighter was scheduled to leave Honolulu on Tuesday
for a rendezvous with Halsey's backers on Christmas Island. They
then hope to acquire a skiff or inflatable craft to take the
supplies to Halsey, fearing the freighter would swamp the rowboat
if it got too close.
</P>

   Halsey has no means of voice communication. The only way backers
know he is alive is from the intermittent satellite locator signals
he is sending.

<HEADLINE> GOP Group Supports Land-Protection  </HEADLINE>
By MATT KELLEY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton's willingness to protect
federal lands by declaring them national monuments has gotten the
attention of Western Republicans in Congress, a group normally
opposed to land-use restrictions but now offering their own
protections.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has bypassed Congress to create three new monuments and
expand a fourth in Arizona and California this year. Interior
Secretary Bruce Babbitt has said he will recommend more monuments
elsewhere if Congress fails to act.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, Western Republicans have contended that new limits
on logging, mining, grazing or recreational use hurt people who
depend on federal lands for their livelihoods. By offering
legislation, they hope to set terms for protection rather than have
the Clinton administration impose them.
</P>
<P>
   Even Rep. Scott McInnis, R-Colo., who has railed against ''ivory
tower bureaucrats'' who want to restrict usage of the 23 million
acres of federal land in his district, is sponsoring
land-protection bills.
</P>
<P>
   McInnis said some of his bills are the result of Babbitt's new
willingness to discuss land management with Republicans rather than
circumvent Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can't ignore him, but I think for the first time he
understands he can't ignore us. That's what's brought us both to
the table, and I think we're moving in a positive direction,''
McInnis said.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt joked at a recent House Resources subcommittee that some
Westerners ''advise their neighbors to batten down the hatches and
protect their firstborn'' when he comes to town. He said he prefers
to have Congress make land preservation decisions but reiterated he
will ask Clinton to intervene if Congress won't.
</P>
<P>
   Congress may protect lands as wilderness areas, conservation
areas or national monuments. A president has authority only to
declare an area a monument.
</P>
<P>
   Wilderness areas are the most restrictive, with almost all uses
banned except low-impact activities such as hiking. Congress has
wide latitude in deciding restrictions for monuments and
conservation areas, and the Republican proposals generally are less
restrictive than what Clinton has imposed.
</P>
<P>
   Among the GOP plans:
</P>
<P>
   --California Rep. Mary Bono wants to create a 272,000-acre Santa
Rosa and San Jacinto Mountains National Monument near Palm Springs.
</P>
<P>
   --Arizona Rep. Jim Kolbe is calling for creation of a
207,000-acre Las Cienegas National Conservation Area southeast of
Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   --Utah Rep. Jim Hansen is proposing wilderness status for about
2.4 million acres in his home state. The bill, drawn as a
compromise between Babbitt and Utah's Republican governor, Mike
Leavitt, covers wilderness zones in national parks, as well as
broad swaths of the state's western deserts.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, McInnis took up a cause started by Sen. Ben
Nighthorse Campbell, R-Colo., and helped push through legislation
to create the Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park in
Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   McInnis now is backing plans to create the 18,000-acre Spanish
Peaks Wilderness near La Veta, Colo., and expand the Great Sand
Dunes National Monument near Alamosa, Colo., and upgrade it to a
national park.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists say they are encouraged but wary of the GOP's
new willingness to embrace land protections.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a lot of potential for protecting some special areas
this year,'' said Melanie Griffin of the Sierra Club. ''But it's
going to be a long year, because there are a lot of people who
don't want to see these victories move forward.''

<HEADLINE> Nude Calendar Ladies Are U.S.-Bound  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Please welcome the ladies of the Rylstone and
District chapter of the Women's Institute. With their clothes on.
</P>
<P>
   A group of middle-age British women who created a hit by posing
nude with knitting and cooking utensils for a 2000 calendar are
planning to take their business to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The ladies, presumably covered, will hit the talk show circuit
to promote the launch of a new edition of their calendar. The new
18-month version -- which runs from June 2000 through December 2001
-- will feature some previously unseen photos of them in their
birthday suits.
</P>
<P>
   But the women aren't limiting their exposure.
</P>
<P>
   In a parody of supermodels who posed naked for an anti-fur
campaign, the women now appear on billboards in Britain wearing
only wide smiles and strategically placed sunflowers to promote a
new laundry detergent from Anglo-Dutch conglomerate Unilever.
''We'd rather go naked than go without Sun Fresh,'' is the ad's
slogan.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've never said we wouldn't strip off again, just that it had
to be in good taste and worthwhile,'' Tricia Stewart, aka Miss
October, told the Daily Express newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   ''There had been a little bit of shyness and embarrassment with
the calendar but not this time.''
</P>
<P>
   The original calendar, conceived as a fund-raiser after a
husband of one of the women died of leukemia, elicited orders from
all over the world.
</P>
<P>
   The women came up with the idea after figuring that their usual
calendars, which featured glowing sunsets and rose-covered
cottages, wouldn't bring in enough money.
</P>
<P>
   They posed nude performing a series of domestic tasks associated
with the Women's Institute -- a service organization founded in 1915
-- including making jam and knitting sweaters.
</P>
<P>
   The spoof of a garage mechanic's calendar was an immediate hit
at $8, and has raised $550,000.

<HEADLINE> Interest Rates Mixed in T-Bill Sale  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Interest rates on short-term Treasury
securities were mixed in Monday's auction.
</P>
<P>
   The Treasury Department sold $8.5 billion in three-month bills
at a discount rate of 5.720 percent, down from 5.780 percent last
week. An additional $7.5 billion was sold in six-month bills at a
rate of 5.905 percent, up from 5.895 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The three-month rate was the lowest since March 6 when the bills
sold for 5.690 percent. The six-month rate was the highest since
March 20, 1995, when the rate was 5.910.
</P>
<P>
   The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors
-- 5.885 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling
for $9,855.40 and 6.171 percent for a six-month bill selling for
$9,701.50.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Monday that the
average yield for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index
for making changes in adjustable rate mortgages, rose to 6.24
percent last week from 6.20 percent the previous week.

<HEADLINE> Congressman Wants Special Counsel  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rep. Dan Burton asked the Justice Department
on Monday to appoint a special outside counsel to investigate
whether the White House engaged in obstruction by failing to
surrender e-mails in the campaign fund-raising scandal.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican chairman of the House Government Reform Committee
said the Justice Department has a conflict of interest because its
civil division lawyers are representing the White House in a
lawsuit involving the e-mails.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department cannot use its campaign fund-raising task
force ''to investigate yourself and the Justice Department lawyers
who helped keep the e-mails from being produced,'' Burton wrote
Attorney General Janet Reno. The department revealed the task
force's probe last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I call on you to appoint a Special Counsel to investigate the
obstruction of justice charges against the White House,'' said
Burton, R-Ind.
</P>
<P>
   Two White House contract employees say a presidential aide
threatened them with dismissal and jail if they revealed computer
glitches that resulted in possibly hundreds of thousands of e-mails
not being reviewed for turnover to investigators.
</P>
<P>
   The presidential aide, attorney Mark Lindsay, denied making
threats, but said he did ask the employees to keep quiet because he
didn't want them gossiping.
</P>
<P>
   A conservative group whose lawsuit revealed the e-mail problem
objected to appointment of a special counsel.
</P>
<P>
   ''Who needs a special counsel when all they ever do is fail,''
said Larry Klayman, head of Judicial Watch.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department is moving to suspend Klayman's lawsuit
until so that it does not interfere with the criminal
investigation.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Incinerator Burns U.S.  </HEADLINE>
By JOSEPH COLEMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATSUGI NAVAL AIR FACILITY, Japan (AP) -- Dioxin season is just
around the corner.
</P>
<P>
   The wind at this U.S. Navy base outside Tokyo will shift with
spring and blow from the south -- bringing with it toxin-laden smoke
from a private garbage incinerator just beyond the base fence.
</P>
<P>
   ''On any given day you can go jogging down there, and this stuff
is coming out,'' said Capt. Kevin P. McNamara, base commanding
officer. ''You walk out your door in the morning, and you can smell
the incinerator.''
</P>
<P>
   Smoke from the plant has rolled into base housing complexes for
years, posing a health threat and becoming a high-profile irritant
between the U.S. government and Japan, home to some 52,000 American
troops.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the U.S. Justice Department announced it had filed a
lawsuit in a Japanese court demanding an immediate halt to the
incinerator operations.
</P>
<P>
   The suit follows months of protests from Washington that
culminated in a Japanese government promise this month to build a
taller smokestack at the plant and install special filters to
reduce emissions.
</P>
<P>
   Military officials at Atsugi say it's too soon to comment on the
deal, concluded during a visit by Defense Secretary William Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   But they say there's a simpler solution -- shut down the plant.
</P>
<P>
   ''It needs to go away. That would be the best of all worlds,''
McNamara said. ''We'd love to see it closed.''
</P>
<P>
   Dioxin has been linked to cancer, birth defects and other health
problems. Last summer, dioxin levels in the air were on average
eight times the Japanese safety limit in areas of the base near the
plant.
</P>
<P>
   On the worst day measured, the toxin was 65 times the Japanese
safety level, the U.S. military says. The worst soil sample on the
base found dioxin at 165 times the Japanese benchmark.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Atsugi accuse the incinerator, operated by a
company called Enviro-Tech, of burning illegal amounts of trash,
thereby forcing the incinerator to work at lower temperatures that
emit more toxins. They also accuse owner Tetsuro Murata of covering
up activities at the plant and consistently fighting efforts to
clean up emissions.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's just an absolute disgrace,'' said Lt. Cmdr. James
Graybeal, a spokesman for U.S. Naval Forces Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Murata is not only fighting the U.S. Navy. He's on trial with
two colleagues for evading $7.6 million in corporate taxes,
according to Yokohama District Court officials.
</P>
<P>
   An official at Enviro-Tech said the company had no immediate
comment on the U.S. lawsuit. However, the company has in the past
denied resisting efforts to clean up emissions. Two of the plant's
three burners are currently shut down so special filters can be
installed.
</P>
<P>
   Atsugi is not the only place in Japan with a dioxin problem. The
country is full of garbage incinerators, and some scientists
believe dioxin pollution in Japan may be the worst in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Residents living around the Navy facility have other complaints:
noise pollution from its thundering jets. They are pushing for an
end to nighttime landing and takeoff drills.
</P>
<P>
   The incinerator dispute is part of broader tensions between
Tokyo and Washington over the U.S. military presence, including
efforts by Japan to reduce the estimated $5 billion it spends for
U.S. troops, a move Washington resists.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the deal reached during Cohen's visit, Japan promised
to build a 330-foot smokestack to better disperse emissions and to
provide free, temporary off-base housing for all who wish it until
the new smokestack is completed.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the 5,000 residents of Atsugi schedule their
days around the haze.
</P>
<P>
   Residents get daily warnings on air quality, and apartments and
schoolrooms are equipped with air filters. Children are urged to
stay inside and shut the windows on bad days.
</P>
<P>
   At a base daycare center, building director Mechell Carter says
it's a shame the wind blows incinerator smoke toward the center at
the time of year the children want most to go out to play -- summer.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are times when a week or two goes by and they can't go
outside,'' she said. ''The kids get frustrated.''

<HEADLINE> Candidates Stayed Focused on Message  </HEADLINE>
By WILL LESTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The two winning candidates in this year's
presidential primaries focused their messages more effectively than
their rivals, according to a study that says George W. Bush was
more consistent than any of the other candidates in emphasizing one
issue -- in his case, taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Also, while they campaigned against each other for their party's
nomination, Bush and fellow Republican John McCain both kept a
steady stream of criticism on Democrat Al Gore -- a move that could
help Bush in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   ''The primaries provided a launching pad for the general
election campaign for Bush that they did not provide for Gore,''
said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, a lead researcher on the study
released Monday by the Annenberg Public Policy Center.
</P>
<P>
   She said polling showed that residents of states with intensive
primary campaigns such as New Hampshire, South Carolina and
Michigan, learned significantly more about the candidates, their
personal stories, character qualities and positions than people in
other states. Iowa did not show the same level of public knowledge
about the campaign as the states with primaries, possibly because
caucuses draw a lower number of participants, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Campaigns do matter,'' Jamieson said, adding that the rush to
hold primaries early in 2000 created a system of ''political haves
and have-nots'' when it comes to voter information about the
campaigns and the candidates.
</P>
<P>
   What may be good for political parties in wrapping up the
nomination early, is not necessarily good for the voters or for the
democratic process, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The general perception from recent polls has been that Gore was
helped and Bush hurt by the primaries. The vice president is
perceived as a stronger candidate, and Bush lost support among some
key groups of swing voters, national polls found. But the Annenberg
study suggested Bush may see some long-term benefits from the
primaries.
</P>
<P>
   ''Although there's a widespread perception that the Republican
primaries were more contested than the Democratic primaries, Bush
managed to stay on message and he and John McCain held their focus
on Al Gore as they argued that one of them was more qualified than
the other,'' said Jamieson, director of the public policy center at
the University of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the governor of Texas, consistently told voters during the
primary season that he wanted to cut taxes, and the issue appears
to have been a bigger factor in his crucial victory in South
Carolina than the support of Christian conservatives, the study
said.
</P>
<P>
   Polling in South Carolina suggested that support for McCain, a
senator from Arizona, dropped steadily throughout the February
campaign among those seriously interested in the tax issue.
</P>
<P>
   The study analyzed the candidates' messages and found that Bush
focused most heavily on taxes both in ads and in debates, Gore most
on education. Neither McCain nor Democrat Bill Bradley focused as
heavily on any one issue as either of the two winners, according to
the study.
</P>
<P>
   The study was based on analysis of debates and ads, as well as
polling of 30,000 respondents between mid-November and the Super
Tuesday primaries. Between 1,500 and 4,000 people were polled
weekly, and the error margin was plus or minus 3 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Jamieson said the time that Bush spent positioning himself
against Gore on issues like campaign fund-raising abuses could pay
off later.
</P>
<P>
   ''Gore hasn't put a comparable set of indictments in place
against Bush,'' the researcher said, adding that Bush's
concentration on taxes will only be effective if taxes turn out to
be a strong issue. National polls have raised questions this year
about how badly voters want tax cuts, however.
</P>
<P>
   ''If Bush is wrong about the issues, then it's not an
advantage,'' Jamieson said. ''He's laid in place the basis to build
his campaign. But if taxes turn out not to be a good issue, then he
squandered an opportunity.''

<HEADLINE> Conoco To Pay $26M in Settlement  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Conoco agreed to pay $26 million to settle
court and administrative claims that the company underpaid
royalties for oil it produced from leased federal and Indian land
since 1988, the Justice Department said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement settles both administrative claims and a False
Claims Act lawsuit originally brought against the Ponca City,
Okla., oil company by two private whistle-blowers on behalf of
taxpayers. The federal government has joined the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ''This settlement brings us one step closer to restoring to the
taxpayers and Indian tribes of the United States the money due for
production of oil on public lands,'' said Mike Bradford, U.S.
attorney for the eastern district of Texas. ''We commend the
company for settling this matter in a way that avoids further
litigation, and we will continue to press forward with the
prosecution of this False Claims Act lawsuit against other
companies that have underpaid their royalty obligations.''
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department already settled with several other oil
companies for underpayment of royalties, including Mobil Oil, for
$45 million; Oxy USA Inc., for $7.3 million; and Chevron, for $95
million.
</P>
<P>
   Federal leases administered by the Interior Department require
Conoco to report each month the amount and value of oil produced on
federal and Indian land. The company pays royalties based on the
value of the oil it reports. The claims alleged the company
systematically underreported the value of oil it produced.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement was signed by representatives of several Indian
tribes, the federal government and Conoco.
</P>
<P>
   Two private whistle-blowers, J. Benjamin Johnson Jr. and John
Martinek, who filed the False Claims Act lawsuit, will share more
than $4.2 million of the $26 million.

<HEADLINE> Army sergeant blamed for sharing free presidential phone service  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- President Clinton's work-related phone bills
rose more than $50,000 after an Army sergeant gave the White House
long-distance calling code to people in the Bronx and New Jersey,
federal prosecutors said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The telephone caper culminated Friday in the arrest of David
Gilmer, 30, of Woodbridge, Va., an Army sergeant assigned to the
Presidential Communications division of the White House
Communications Agency.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White alleged in court papers filed in
U.S. District Court in Manhattan that Gilmer gave phone access
numbers to others, helping them make 9,400 unauthorized calls
between Dec. 5 and Feb. 8.
</P>
<P>
   According to court papers, they were tapping into the same
telephone service provided to the president, vice president, White
House senior staff, the National Security Council, U.S. Secret
Service and others given access to the system by the White House
Military Office.
</P>
<P>
   Marvin Smilon, a spokesman for White, said there was no
indication that those who obtained the access codes could have done
anything more than make free phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   The people, some at pay phones, tapped into the Private Branch
Exchange, a computerized telephone system owned by private
companies but operated by the White House Communications Agency to
which Gilmer was assigned.
</P>
<P>
   They were able to punch in a sequence of numbers and get a dial
tone through the White House telephone system, allowing them to
make calls anywhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
   A criminal complaint accused Gilmer of giving out the access
codes knowing that those who had it could obtain free telephone
service from the AT&AMP;T Co., which provides long-distance service to
the White House.
</P>
<P>
   More than a week ago, federal investigators searched six
locations in the Bronx, one in Manhattan and one in New Jersey to
gather evidence in the case.
</P>
<P>
   During the search in New Jersey, agents discovered evidence of
telephone fraud and interviewed an individual who admitted having
received the access codes from Gilmer, according to the complaint
signed by Secret Service Agent J. Alexander Pickett.
</P>
<P>
   The individual then agreed to allow federal agents to tape a
telephone call in which the individual asked Gilmer for an
additional access code to make a telephone call, the complaint
alleged.
</P>
<P>
   During a second taped phone call with the individual, Gilmer
admitted that he had provided access codes to others, according to
the complaint.
</P>
<P>
   Gilmer was held for an initial court appearance in Alexandria,
Va.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Off 86.87; Nasdaq Off 4.90  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Microsoft deflated every major stock market
index today, falling steeply after the government reportedly
rejected the company's offer to settle their antitrust case.
Microsoft's decline masked strength in other technology issues.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average fell 86.87 to close at
11,025.85. The blue-chip index lost an early gain due to
Microsoft's weakness and profit-taking in the financial shares that
soared last week.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators closed modestly lower. The New York
Stock Exchange recorded its lowest volume of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index fell 4.90 to 4,958.13, and the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 fell 3.67 to 1,523.79.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 4-to-3 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, with 1,704 down, 1,284 up and 487
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   NYSE volume totaled 876.26 million shares as of 4 p.m., vs. 1.03
billion in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 0.38 to 573.63.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, the most actively traded Nasdaq stock, fell. Sources
have told The Associated Presss that government lawyers have
concluded Microsoft's offer to settle their antitrust case was
inadequate, and they are preparing for U.S. District Judge Thomas
Penfield Jackson to deliver a verdict as early as Tuesday. Jackson
has previously hinted he will rule strongly against Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Microsoft shares rose as much as 12 percent amid
reports that the company was nearing a settlement with the
government.
</P>
<P>
   ''Microsoft ran way up in anticipation of some good news over
the weekend,'' said Scott Bleier, chief investment strategist at
Prime Charter Ltd. ''Did it get ahead of itself? Yes. Investors are
still waiting to see what the government has to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Many other technology companies advanced today.
</P>
<P>
   IBM rose after Morgan Stanley Dean Witter raised its rating on
the stock from ''neutral'' to ''outperform.'' Cisco Systems and Sun
Microsystems rose as portfolio managers scrambled to add them to
their portfolios before the end of the first quarter on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The stocks that are the institutional favorites continue to
power higher,'' Bleier said. ''There's a major markup of large-cap
technology stocks.''
</P>
<P>
   Unisys rose after a German magazine reported Deutsche Telekom is
interested in acquiring it. Unisys declined to comment to Dow Jones
News Service, and called the report a rumor.
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks before companies begin reporting their
first-quarter earnings, technology stocks are likely to lead the
market as investors buy them on the promise of strong earnings
growth, said John H. Shaughnessy, chief investment strategist at
Advest Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe stock selection should continue to focus on those
companies with strong earnings momentum,'' he said. ''This would
include technology stocks.''
</P>
<P>
   The earnings reporting season will gather momentum in mid-April.
Until then, traders said the market may remain in a fairly narrow
range with no clear catalyst to spark a major swing in either
direction.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of oil producers trading actively as OPEC oil ministers
adjourned their meeting in Vienna without reaching an agreement on
production increases. OPEC members are considering raising
production by 1.5 million to 1.7 million barrels a day, which would
bring oil prices down from nine-year highs.
</P>
<P>
   Exxon Mobil fell and BP Amoco was down.
</P>
<P>
   Investment bank Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette fell after Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter analyst Henry McVey downgraded the stock to
''neutral'' from ''outperform.'' McVey cited concerns that DLJ may
have reached a peak in valuation.
</P>
<P>
   Other financial stocks, which rose after the Federal Reserve
announced its decision to raise interest rates modestly last
Tuesday, fell as investors took profits. American Express was down.

<HEADLINE> Giuliani's reaction to shooting hurting him in polls  </HEADLINE>
By TIMOTHY WILLIAMS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A new poll suggests that Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani's unsympathetic response after the latest police shooting
of an unarmed black man is hurting him in his Senate race against
Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The Zogby International poll taken over the weekend shows
Giuliani's 7-point lead has vanished following the killing of
26-year-old Patrick Dorismond on March 16. Clinton now has 45
percent to Giuliani's 42.3 percent advantage -- within the poll's
3.8-point margin of error.
</P>
<P>
   The poll also shows that the Republican mayor would receive just
28 percent of the vote in the city he leads -- down from 44 percent
three weeks ago. Giuliani's support has also tumbled in several key
demographic areas, including among upstate voters, Jews and
Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty percent of the people polled said the mayor should have
offered condolences to the victim's family, and one in four said
the issue would be a factor in whether they vote for Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's handing her the race,'' said pollster John Zogby. ''It's
not that she's doing better, it's that he's doing worse. We've seen
the tide turn.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, known for his combative responses to criticism,
brushed aside the poll results Monday at a news conference in
Albany.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm absolutely destroyed by it,'' he joked. Turning serious,
he said: ''No. I'm not concerned about it at all. I think that if
you've been through tough elections, as I have, you expect to be up
in the polls, you expect to be down in the polls and you expect to
be statistically tied in the polls.''
</P>
<P>
   Dorismond, a security guard and son of a prominent Haitian
singer, was killed by an undercover officer in a botched police
drug sting. It is unclear whether the officer fired by accident.
</P>
<P>
   He became the fourth unarmed black man shot to death by New York
City police in the past 13 months, including Amadou Diallo, who was
killed in a barrage of 41 bullets in 1999. After each case,
Giuliani has defended the police involved and blamed the victim.
</P>
<P>
   After the Dorismond shooting, Giuliani released the man's
criminal record, including supposedly sealed documents about an
arrest when he was 13. The mayor repeatedly suggested that
Dorismond was a violent person who brought on his own death.
</P>
<P>
   He again defended police Saturday against charges they may have
provoked clashes after Dorismond's funeral, in which 23 officers
were injured and 27 civilians arrested.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton campaign has made Giuliani's handling of the
shooting Exhibit A in its effort to paint him as too ill-tempered
for the Senate, but Giuliani has refused to soften his stance. He
has said the news media are unable to cover police shootings
fairly.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think I handled it appropriately, appropriate to the
situation and appropriate to what had to be done in order to make
sure that the public got information that the media to this day is
still suppressing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier polls have shown Giuliani with as little as 5 percent
support among black voters, and observers believe the mayor's
hard-edged response to the shooting could generate a large turnout
of Democrats in a state where they outnumber Republicans by about
5-3.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Giuliani's statement that the city's police are among
the nation's most ''restrained'' in firing their weapons, a Daily
News-New York 1 poll found that 72 percent of respondents believed
that ''the use of deadly force has gotten out of hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Republican political consultant Jay Severin said he
doubts the Dorismond shooting will have much effect on the roughly
15 percent of voters who are undecided.
</P>
<P>
   ''The worst thing that's going to come out of this is that
Rudy's going to appear to be tough on crime and Hillary's going to
appear to be too weak on crime,'' he said. ''I don't think the
undecideds are going to vote for someone they perceive as being
weak on crime.''

<HEADLINE> Iraqis Vote For New Parliament  </HEADLINE>
By DONNA BRYSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- Voting was brisk and orderly Monday as
Iraqis choose a new parliament expected to be energized by the
presence of President Saddam Hussein's eldest son and heir
apparent.
</P>
<P>
   Odai Hussein -- a powerful figure who was making his formal
political debut -- was among 512 candidates running for 220 seats in
the National Assembly. He was widely expected to win a seat, which
will help him begin to build a formal power base.
</P>
<P>
   The 36-year-old Odai voted shortly before polls closed at 8
p.m., roaring up in a convoy of luxury cars and entering the
polling station in an upscale neighborhood, surrounded by guards
wearing business suits and toting automatic weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a traditional black robe trimmed in gold and a flowing
white headdress, Odai walked with difficulty as a result of
injuries suffered in a 1996 assassination attempt.
</P>
<P>
   He said he would do ''whatever brings good to the great Iraqi
people,'' after pulling his ballot from a pocket and dropping it
into the box. He said he would work to bring Iraq the multiparty
system his father promised a decade ago, but did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   While critics dismiss Iraq's democracy as a sham, Iraqis used
the vote to express genuine fears and hopes.
</P>
<P>
   Khuder Murad Atti, whose 11-year-old son has leukemia, said he
hopes a new parliament will help lift an international trade
embargo against Iraq imposed to punish Saddam for invading Kuwait
in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ''By putting honest people into the National Assembly ... we can
lift the embargo as soon as possible,'' said Atti.
</P>
<P>
   The National Assembly is elected after a strictly controlled
campaign and seen as a rubber stamp for Saddam, doing little more
than making recommendations to the Revolutionary Command Council he
heads.
</P>
<P>
   It has little influence over the sanctions, which can be lifted
only if Iraq convinces the U.N. Security Council that it has
surrendered its nuclear, biological and chemical weapons programs,
a condition Iraq insists it has fulfilled.
</P>
<P>
   The United States accuses Iraq of hiding weapons and has worked
to ensure that sanctions remain in place, despite increasing
criticism from around the world that they have crippled the Iraqi
economy and done little to hurt Saddam.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq is permitted to buy food and medicine under a U.N. program
created in 1996 that allows Iraq to export oil through
U.N.-controlled sales, provided the proceeds be used for
humanitarian supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, with their economy weakened by sanctions and war, the
Iraqi middle class has been stripped of its buying power.
</P>
<P>
   Atti retired from a civil service job to try to make more money
as a free-lance dealer in used goods. But he was selling most of
his own household furniture a day before the vote. He needed to
raise cash for his 11-year-old son's treatment for leukemia, which
he said cost about $100 every 20 days. Atti, who has seven other
children, said he earns less than $10 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Turnout was reported high during 12 hours of voting at 1,574
stations across the country. Failing to vote could be seen as an
expression of opposition to a government that tolerates little
dissent and has portrayed the balloting as a signal to the West of
its determination in the face of international isolation.
</P>
<P>
   Counting began immediately after polls closed. Final results
were expected Tuesday, and the parliament was expected to convene
in April.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the lawmakers elected Monday, Saddam will appoint
30 representatives for Kurdish areas in the north where voting was
not held. The Iraqi leader effectively lost control over Kurdish
areas a decade ago in an uprising following the 1991 Persian Gulf
War.

<HEADLINE> Explosion Shakes Texas Oil Plant  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Texas (AP) -- An explosion Monday rocked a Phillips
Petroleum chemical plant near the Houston Ship Channel, injuring at
least 19 people and sparking a fire that send thick smoke over the
area.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was in the main shop area when I heard a loud explosion,''
said Tim Williams, a plant worker who estimated he was more than
200 yards from the explosion. ''My ears hurt, and I took off
running. I looked back and saw flames, and kept going.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the injured, at least 12 were hospitalized in critical
condition. Some were burned severely, Mayor Johnny Isbell said.
</P>
<P>
   An hour after the 1:25 p.m. blast, everyone had not been
accounted for, said plant spokesman Norm Berkley.
</P>
<P>
   Workers in neighboring plants and area residents were urged to
remain indoors while officials tried to determine what was burning.
Children in area schools were kept inside after the bell rang.
</P>
<P>
   Smoke continued to rise two hours after the blast, but the
density was diminishing rapidly. Smoke clearly was visible across
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The Phillips complex was the site of a 1989 series of explosions
and fires in a polyethylene reactor that killed 23 and injured 130.
</P>
<P>
   Last June, two people were killed and four were injured in an
explosion at the complex. Afterward, federal officials fined
Phillips $204,000 for 13 alleged safety violations.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: Probe Needed in Chechen War  </HEADLINE>
By PAULINE JELINEK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton called Russian
president-elect Vladimir Putin on Monday to congratulate him on his
victory at the polls and press again for an end to suffering in the
war-ravaged Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said in a statement issued at the White House that he
stressed Russia must launch ''impartial and transparent
investigations of reported human rights violations'' in Chechnya,
and allow prompt, full access to the province for international
relief organizations and the press.
</P>
<P>
   ''We hope that the new Russian government will find its own way
towards achieving a political solution in Chechnya,'' State
Department spokesman James Foley added later in the department's
regular briefing.
</P>
<P>
   ''Until that happens, we have a serious and profound
disagreement.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say Putin's uncompromising tactics in pursuing the
rebellion in the Caucasus region played well with Russian voters in
the months before the election. But it has also brought widespread
international criticism and repeated calls for a negotiated end to
the conflict because of the deaths and suffering it has caused
since September among the civilian population.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've not seen movement on the Russian side, we've not seen a
recognition ... on their part that they need a political process,
that there is no military solution,'' Foley said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's statement also stressed issues on which the United
States hopes to work cooperatively with Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ''President-elect Putin has an opportunity to translate his
electoral mandate into concrete steps to advance economic reform,
to strengthen the rule of law, to intensify the fight against crime
and corruption, and to join with us on a broad common agenda of
international security including arms control, nonproliferation and
regional peace and stability,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore congratulated the Russian people ''for
once again demonstrating their commitment to hard-won democratic
freedoms by turning out to vote.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope that the President-elect will seize this opportunity to
strengthen the foundations of Russia's democracy, economic
recovery, and international integration,'' Gore said in a
statement. ''I also urge Mr. Putin to work toward a lasting
political solution in Chechnya. ''

<HEADLINE> Customs Service Has Most Wanted List  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Watch your back FBI. Your 10 Most Wanted
Fugitives list is getting some competition from another law
enforcement agency: the U.S. Customs Service.
</P>
<P>
   Customs released its own Most Wanted list Monday -- something it
hasn't done since 1991. In the past, the agency sporadically put
out a Most Wanted list but had trouble getting it disseminated
internationally.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the customs service is posting the list on its Web
site -- www.customs.gov -- and officials hope the Internet posting
will give it more visibility.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI's Most Wanted list, which recently turned 50 years old,
is posted on the Web, too: www.fbi.gov.
</P>
<P>
   Customs' current list represents a cross-section of some of the
top criminals in the international arena, said Customs Commissioner
Raymond Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   On the list are alleged: international narcotics money
launderer, Jose Alvarez Tostado; arms dealers, Frans Van Anraat and
Houshang Amir Bagheri; child pornographers, David Creamer and
Timothy Allen Groves; international transporters of stolen goods,
Mohamad Reda Tabbara and Luar Vetus Lorrett; and narcotics
traffickers, Sidney Lewis, Juan Carlos Arboleda and John Innocent
Okayfor.

<HEADLINE> Boy's Suffering Unites Cyprus  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) -- The plight of a 6-year-old boy whose life
depends on finding a bone marrow donor has brought together the
rival Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities of war-divided Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, scores of Turkish Cypriots crossed into the
U.N.-controlled buffer zone splitting the island to have their
blood tested to see if they can provide a transplant to save
Andreas Vassiliou, a Greek Cypriot boy suffering from leukemia.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a very good development that will help build trust
between the two sides,'' said Mehemt Ali Talat of the opposition
Republican Turkish Party.
</P>
<P>
   Cyprus has been divided into a Greek Cypriot-controlled south
and a Turkish-occupied north since a 1974 Turkish invasion. The
Turkish Cypriot state prevents free movement between the two sides
except in rare cases.
</P>
<P>
   More than 50,000 Greek Cypriots have already come forward since
the boy's father made a plea for donation nine days ago. Doctors
say the chances of finding a suitable donor are 30,000 to one.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are trying to help a little boy, we hope he gets better,''
said Serdar Denktash, son of Rauf Denktash, president of the
Turkish Cypriot state. ''This is a humanitarian action nothing to
do with politics.''

<HEADLINE> Greenspan Warns on Budget Surpluses  </HEADLINE>
By ALICE ANN LOVE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan
admonished lawmakers Monday to resist temptations to spend budget
surpluses, saying that reducing the national debt is the best way
to prepare for the expense of baby boomers' retirements.
</P>
<P>
   ''Saving the surpluses -- if politically feasible ---- is, in my
judgment, the most important fiscal measure we can take at this
time to foster continued improvements in productivity,'' said
Greenspan, testifying before the Senate Special Committee on Aging.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's central bank chairman also sought to calm fears
that a recent spike in energy prices could dampen the overall
economy.
</P>
<P>
   ''Currently, we do not as yet, and emphasize as yet, see any
significant indication that crude oil price increases are in the
process of embedding themselves in other areas of the economy and
inflating the general price structure,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Aging Committee pressed Greenspan on whether
government surpluses from income taxes -- as opposed to those that
come from the special payroll taxes that finance Social Security
and Medicare -- should be used to bolster the nation's retirement
programs.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed chairman took no clear stand, however.
</P>
<P>
   Promising future income tax surpluses to Social Security and
Medicare could create a political incentive for lawmakers to follow
through on reducing the national debt, Greenspan said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Given that our record of sustaining surpluses for extended
periods of time is not good, any device that might accomplish this
goal is worth examining,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   However, he also raised concerns that transferring more money to
the retirement programs ''could take the steam out'' of efforts to
make moneysaving changes he said should be considered, such as
raising the retirement age and improving health care delivery.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan said he is disappointed that discussions of proposals
to let Americans keep some of their Social Security contributions
to invest individually in the stock market have stalled.
</P>
<P>
   ''I grant you that at the end of the day, we may conclude as a
nation that that's not the right way to go,'' he said, but added,
''I would hate to have it happen without appropriate discussion.''
</P>
<P>
   Congressional debate on Social Security and Medicare reforms
this year has been largely limited to the role surpluses should
play.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has proposed using income tax surpluses as
well as Social Security surpluses to reduce the national debt, then
give Social Security and Medicare IOUs equal to the amount of
interest payments the federal government would save from debt
reduction.
</P>
<P>
   The IOUs would have to be paid off with income taxes in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   ''The scale of the future demands on both programs implies that
structural reforms will not be enough,'' said Treasury Assistant
Secretary David Wilcox, also testifying Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Republicans want surpluses from Social Security
payroll taxes protected and used for debt reduction. But they argue
that most of the income tax surplus should be returned to Americans
in the form of tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ''That is an obvious place to look for funds for Social Security
and Medicare, but I'm not sure that I need to tell anyone here that
this is not free money,'' said committee Chairman Chuck Grassley,
R-Iowa. ''This money will be amassed by taxing the American people
and that's not something we do lightly.''
</P>
<P>
   On fuel prices, Greenspan said it is not clear how high they
would have to go to spread inflation to other areas of the economy,
and he doubted whether it is in the oil-producing nations' interest
to let prices reach that level.
</P>
<P>
   ''But that does not say that it can't happen,'' Greenspan said.
''There's no doubt in my mind that energy, which tends to cut
across all aspects of this economy, if it gets sufficiently costly,
could have some materially negative effects.''

<HEADLINE> 11 Convicted in Drug Gang War  </HEADLINE>
By CATHERINE WILSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- A jury Monday convicted all 11 defendants who
belonged to a drug gang that authorities say smuggled tons of
cocaine into the United States and killed dozens of rivals to
protect its turf through the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The Boobie Boys gang was targeted by a joint federal-state task
force after Miami-Dade police detectives realized they had a drug
war on their hands. With gang members in custody since 1997, murder
rates have fallen by one-third to one-half on the gang's home turf.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorneys promised to appeal the 5-ton cocaine
distribution conspiracy case carrying possible life sentences for
all. Sentencing was set for June 6.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth ''Boobie'' Williams, whose nickname covered the gang,
and his right-hand man, Efrain Cosado, also were found guilty of an
umbrella racketeering count alleging trafficking and violence.
</P>
<P>
   No murder charges were part of the federal indictment, but the
jury was handed photo blowups of drug crime victims and other
close-up pictures of bullet-riddled bodies.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think that they had so much evidence that they should not
have had that colored their decision,'' said Jason Grey, attorney
for Jonathan ''Moose'' Hawthorne. ''Based on the evidence before
the jury, their verdict is certainly understandable.''
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials say the Boobie Boys gang killed to
establish its turf and to retaliate against rivals as it built a
drug empire that smuggled $85 million worth of cocaine across 25
Florida cities and 12 states from 1990 to 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The gang was blamed for 35 murders, including the death of a
5-year-old boy in a drive-by shooting that killed a rival drug
dealer and his girlfriend. Shootings tied to the gang since 1993
wounded more than 100 people.

   Dow Ends Off 86.87; Nasdaq Off 4.90
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Microsoft deflated every major stock market
index today, falling steeply after the government reportedly
rejected the company's offer to settle their antitrust case.
Microsoft's decline masked strength in other technology issues. The
Dow Jones industrial average fell 86.87 to close at 11,025.85. The
blue-chip index lost an early gain due to Microsoft's weakness and
profit-taking in the financial shares that soared last week.
Broader stock indicators closed modestly lower. The New York Stock
Exchange recorded its lowest volume of the year. The Nasdaq
composite index fell 4.90 to 4,958.13.

   NEW YORK (ap) -- Microsoft, the most actively traded Nasdaq

settle their antitrust case was inadequate, and they are preparing
for U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson to deliver a
verdict as early as tomorrow. Jackson has previously hinted he will
rule strongly against Microsoft. Last week, Microsoft shares rose
as much as 12 percent amid reports that the company was nearing a
settlement with the government.

   Greenspan Prods Hill on Surpluses
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan told a
Senate committee today nothing could have a better impact on the
nation's ability to meet the expenses of baby boomers' retirements
than saving big government surpluses to pay down the national debt.
He said saving the surpluses -- if politically feasible -- is, in his
judgment, ''the most important fiscal measure we can take at this
time to foster continued improvements in productivity,'' Greenspan
said he had no strong views on whether future income taxes should
be transferred directly to Social Security and Medicare -- something
President Clinton has proposed, but Republicans and some moderate
Democrats object to.

   Existing-Home Sales Rise in February
</P>

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Mortgage rates are up, but that hasn't
prevented sales of existing homes to go up too -- by 6.7 percent in

4.75 million units last month after having fallen a sharper than
previously reported 13.4 percent in January, the National

<P>
   NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- The loan policies of Latin America's largest

disasters, U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said today.
Summers, who was named to a one-year term as chairman of the
Inter-American Development Bank's governing board, proposed a
yearlong lending policy review that he believes could also lead to
more private business loans.

   Jury Awards Ex-Smoker $20 Million
</P>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A dying ex-smoker was awarded $20 million
in punitive damages today in her lawsuit against the nation's two
largest tobacco companies. The Superior Court jury ordered Philip
Morris and R.J. Reynolds to each pay $10 million to Leslie Whiteley
and her husband. The same jury awarded the couple $1.7 million in
compensation last week after finding that the companies deceived
the public about the dangers of smoking. That verdict was the first
for a smoker who took up the habit after the surgeon general's
warnings first appeared on cigarette packages in the 1960s.

   OPEC Discusses Oil Output
</P>
<P>
   VIENNA, Austria a (AP) -- Iran accepts the need for OPEC to boost
petroleum output, the Iranian oil minister said Monday, but the
amount of an increase favored by his country might not be enough to
ease prices that have soared to nine-year highs. Iranian Oil
Minister Bijan Namdar Zangeneh spoke prior to a formal gathering of
all 11 OPEC oil ministers, who adjourned their first session late
Monday without reaching a decision on production. Iran is known to
favor boosting output by about 1.2 million barrels a day, which
probably would do little to reduce world oil prices.

   P&AMP;G Seeks Bids for Oxydol Brand
</P>
<P>
   CINCINNATI (AP) -- The Procter &AMP; Gamble Co. is soliciting offers
for its Oxydol brand laundry detergent, a mainstay of the consumer
products giant since 1927. ''Although Oxydol is a highly profitable
and recognized brand, it is no longer a strategic fit for us,''
Paul Polman, president of P&AMP;G's Global Fabric Care division, said
today. ''We are putting more focus against building brands that
offer the greatest potential for global growth.'' The
Cincinnati-based P&AMP;G, which also owns the top-selling detergent
Tide, said it would retain the Oxydol brand if it does not get an
acceptable offer.

   German Auto Mergers Round Out Lines
</P>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- Alliances announced today by
DaimlerChrysler AG and Volkswagen AG take Europe's two largest
automakers in opposite directions toward the same goal -- rounding
out their product lines to stay alive in the latest round of global
consolidation. DaimlerChrysler shelled out $2 billion for a 34
percent stake in Japan's Mitsubishi Motors Corp., giving the German
automaker new inroads in Asia but also the technical edge needed to
push its new line of smaller, more fuel efficient cars. Likewise,
Volkswagen, known for subcompact hits like the Beetle, filled in a
big gap as it laid out $1.6 billion for a controlling stake in
Swedish bus and truck maker Scania AB.

   Japanese Women in Work Force Decline
</P>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- The number of Japanese women in the work force
declined for the first time in 24 years, according to a government
report today. It blamed the country's economic slump for a fall of
120,000 to 27.6 million in the number of women who have jobs or are
actively seeking them. The Labor Ministry's White Paper on Women
also said unemployment among Japanese women rose to an all-time
high of 4.5 percent in 1999, up from 4.0 percent in 1998.

   LONDON (AP) -- The French stock market started the week
bullishly, in contrast to declines today on other key European

Premier Laurent Fabius to the finance portfolio, and reports of
further consolidation in the French telecom and media sectors
pushed the CAC 40 index up 1.4 percent to 6,450.85. Elsewhere in
Europe, London's Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was
down 0.8 percent to 6,687.2; Frankfurt's Xetra DAX Index was down
0.5 percent, at 7,892.49, and Italy's MIB30 index was off 0.2
percent to 32,819. The Dow Jones Euro Stoxx Index was up 0.92

<HEADLINE> Dollar Up Vs. European Currencies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar rose against European currencies
Monday, gaining back ground lost last week following an increase in
Swiss interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar rose against the euro, the British pound and the
Swiss franc as expectations for additional interest rate hikes in
Europe fizzled.
</P>
<P>
   The unusually large Swiss rate hike of three-quarters of a
percentage point last week had raised hopes that other European
central banks would follow suit, but comments from officials at the
Bank of England and the European Central Bank downplayed the
possibility of more increases.
</P>
<P>
   In late New York trading, the euro was quoted at 96.62 cents,
down from 97.53 late Friday, and the British pound fell to $1.5878
from $1.5926. The dollar also rose against the Swiss franc, trading
at 1.6441 Swiss francs, up from 1.6277 late Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In other trading, the dollar was quoted at 106.87 Japanese yen,
down from 107.05, and 1.4585 Canadian dollars, down from 1.4636.
</P>
<P>
   Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate.
Based on Monday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 2.0242 German
marks, up from 2.0053; 6.7890 French francs, up from 6.7254; and
2,004.01 Italian lire, up from 1,985.21.

<HEADLINE> Closing Arguments in Sharif's Trial  </HEADLINE>
By ZAHID HUSSAIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) -- The lawyer for Pakistan's deposed prime
minister wound up closing arguments Monday, saying prosecutors
failed to prove that Nawaz Sharif refused to allow an airplane
carrying the country's military chief to land.
</P>
<P>
   Khwaja Sultan tried to discredit prosecution witnesses and spent
much of the day reading out their written statements and court
testimony, citing discrepancies over persons named and the timing
of events.
</P>
<P>
   ''The prosecution has failed miserably to provide any
circumstantial evidence of hijacking,'' said Sultan, who represents
Sharif and four others charged with hijacking, terrorism, attempted
murder and kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the other two codefendants were scheduled to give
separate closing arguments Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The seven are accused of endangering the life of army chief Gen.
Pervez Musharraf by refusing to give his airliner permission to
land in the southern city of Karachi. The standoff occurred during
an Oct. 12 coup in which the military seized power in Pakistan
after Sharif dismissed Musharraf.
</P>
<P>
   Sultan earlier had argued that Musharraf was responsible for
putting the 198 passengers and crew at risk because he had ordered
his plane to remain aloft until his troops secured the airport. The
aircraft landed with only seven minutes of fuel remaining, the
pilot has testified.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict and sentencing by the antiterrorist court is
expected next week. The charges carry mandatory death sentences.

<HEADLINE> OPEC Might Boost Oil Output  </HEADLINE>
By BRUCE STANLEY, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- OPEC oil ministers failed to reach
agreement Monday on how much crude oil to add to global supplies,
with Iran seen as the chief obstacle to a consensus that could
provide some price relief to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The ministers were to resume discussions Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Iran accepts the need for OPEC to boost output, the Iranian Oil
Minister Bijan Namdar Zangeneh said, but the amount of an increase
favored by his country might not be enough to reduce petroleum
prices from nine-year highs.
</P>
<P>
   Zangeneh spoke before the opening Monday of the semiannual
meeting of oil ministers from all 11 members of the Organization of
the Petroleum Exporting Countries.
</P>
<P>
   ''I won't talk on numbers, but we don't want a market
shortage,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Iran, OPEC's second-largest producer, is known to favor boosting
output by about 1.2 million barrels a day -- an amount that probably
would do little to reduce world oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   An OPEC delegate, speaking on condition of anonymity, told
reporters that Libya, Indonesia and Nigeria back Iran's position.
</P>
<P>
   Two other key producers in the group, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait,
have proposed a production increase of 1.5 million to 1.7 million
barrels a day. The upper limit of their proposed increase would
amount to about 7 percent more than what OPEC members agreed to
pump after curtailing output last March.
</P>
<P>
   For U.S. motorists and other consumers of refined products such
as gasoline, much hinges on efforts by Saudi Arabia, OPEC's No. 1
producer, to win Iran over to its point of view.
</P>
<P>
   American motorists now pay an average of $1.59 per gallon for
unleaded gasoline, an increase of nearly 60 cents since prices
bottomed out at 99.8 cents per gallon in February 1999, according
to a Lundberg Survey of 10,000 U.S. gas stations released Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts warn of possible shortages and $2-a-gallon gas
during the peak driving season this summer if OPEC fails to
increase production significantly.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan sought Monday
to minimize fears raised by some U.S. lawmakers that a recent spike
in fuel prices could have a negative effect on economy.
</P>
<P>
   ''Currently, we do not as yet -- and emphasize as yet -- see any
significant indication that crude oil price increases are in the
process of embedding themselves in other areas of the economy and
inflating the general price structure,'' he said in testimony
before a Senate committee in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan said it was unclear what level of energy inflation
would be needed to spread to other areas of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   OPEC, which operates on consensus decisions, must decide whether
to extend cuts it made in 1998 and 1999 that have propelled oil
prices to their highest levels since the 1991 Persian Gulf War. The
latest round of cuts expires at the end of the week.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. oil prices tripled to a March 8 peak of $34.37 per barrel
following OPEC's decision last March to slash production.
</P>
<P>
   Prices for U.S. West Texas intermediate crude in the United
States, world's biggest consumer of oil, and Brent crude from the
North Sea have eased somewhat in recent weeks amid optimism that
OPEC will raise output.
</P>
<P>
   Crude oil for delivery in May fell 23 cents to $27.79 a barrel
Monday on the New York Mercantile Exchange. In London, May Brent
also fell 23 cents to $25.68 on the International Petroleum
Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, world's biggest consumer of oil, has lobbied
the cartel to raise production. The government has said that an
increase of 2 million to 2.5 million barrels per day is needed to
replenish inventories and satisfy growing world demand.
</P>
<P>
   OPEC pumps more than 26 million barrels of crude each day, or
about 35 percent of the world's supply. Key non-OPEC producers,
such as Mexico and Norway which cut back their production in tandem
with OPEC, have said they are watching to see what OPEC will do
before adjusting their own output.
</P>
<P>
   The Saudis want to stabilize prices at a level that won't cause
extreme economic pain for the nations that buy its oil. If high
prices start damaging economies, producers fear that demand for oil
-- and OPEC's export earnings -- could plummet.
</P>
<P>
   OPEC members currently are producing about 1.2 million barrels a
day over the cartel's quota. The quota increase sought by Iran
would just about ''legitimize'' that amount but would fall short of
adding more crude to the work's inventories.
</P>
<P>
   Libya added to the uncertainty about the outcome of the
semiannual meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Abdalla Salem El-Badri, head of Libya's National Oil Corp. told
reporters that he was still concerned that global demand for oil
might decline in the second quarter of the year, when demand for
oil and refined products historically dips to its annual ebb. He
suggested Libya would like to see production raised later this
year.

Peacemaking Frustrating Clinton   
An AP News Analysis, 
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- After hitting brick wall after brick wall on
his overseas tour, President Clinton's hopes for promoting peace in
South Asia and the Middle East are on hold, at best, and time is
running out for him.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential aides have insisted Clinton's goal in meetings with
Indian and Pakistani officials and with Syrian President Hafez
Assad was to make peace, not to promote his legacy during the last
of his eight years in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   But the two basically go together.
</P>
<P>
   Even before Clinton set out for South Asia, his chances of
persuading India and Pakistan to back down from their nuclear
programs was considered virtually nil. He didn't, and to Clinton's
chagrin, Pakistan's military leaders refused even to promise
restoration of democracy.
</P>
<P>
   In India, despite lavishing praise on the world's largest
democracy, spending more time there than any of his predecessors
and respectfully seeing the sights, Clinton heard from government
leaders that nonproliferation of technology was not a realistic
option for dealing with Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   Nor was there progress on Kashmir. That could be ominous.
</P>
<P>
   India and Pakistan have fought two wars over the three-fifths of
the Himalayan state that is under Indian control. The dispute is
probably even more explosive now that they both have nuclear
capability.
</P>
<P>
   On the plus side, Clinton strengthened U.S. relations with
India, which have not always been warm. Considering India's growing
importance, especially in technology, that was a plus.
</P>
<P>
   His meeting in Geneva with Assad had no such silver lining.
</P>
<P>
   Three hours of face-to-face negotiations, the first lengthy
exchange between the two leaders in six years, failed Sunday to
restart the talks between Israel and Syria that broke down in
Shepherdstown, W.Va., in mid-January.
</P>
<P>
   ''The differences are significant and important, and obviously
more work needs to be done to bridge them,'' White House spokesman
Joe Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   For Clinton to come away empty-handed indicates either
miscalculation by the White House or that the dispute between
Israel and Syria is intractable.
</P>
<P>
   Neither is good news for a would-be peacemaker.
</P>
<P>
   Judith Kipper, director of the Middle East Forum for the Council
on Foreign Relations, said the standoff between Clinton and Assad
in Geneva was a disappointment but not a disaster.
</P>
<P>
   ''What is clear is that the Syrians are prepared to go a long
way on what Israel requires, providing they get all of the
territory they lost in the 1967 Mideast war,'' Kipper said in an
interview. ''Without that, there is no peace with Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   Her advice to Clinton was ''to work on Prime Minister Barak to
get the Israelis to come to terms with the land issue -- for both
the Syrians and the Palestinians. There is no peace without it.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's failure to achieve a breakthrough makes an early
accord with Syria unlikely. And in Jerusalem, Israeli officials
warned that a unilateral withdrawal from Lebanon could spark a
conflict with Syria -- and put Clinton on a hot spot.
</P>
<P>
   Syria was looking for a helping hand from the American.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly disappointed, Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa
said in comments published Monday in Damascus that Clinton offered
nothing new in his talks with Assad.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were surprised that the U.S. president was not carrying
anything new from the Israeli side but was asking from Syria what
might help Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak in his difficult
position, which we think is of his own making,'' al-Sharaa told
Lebanon's As-Safir newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. peace effort, meanwhile, lumbers along on a parallel
track between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Their negotiators will wind up eight days of talks Tuesday at
Bolling Air Force Base in Washington, D.C., without agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our assessment of the talks is that they have been serious,
intensive and, indeed, productive,'' State Department spokesman
James Foley said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiators will return in a few weeks, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, who will meet Tuesday with
Clinton, said before the Geneva meeting that Israel and Syria were
close to an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   His foreign minister, Amr Moussa, said the Egyptian president,
indeed, was ''very hopeful.''
</P>
<P>
   With a smile, the veteran diplomat quickly added: ''Delete the
'very.'''

<HEADLINE> US Airways Offers Discounts  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Va. (AP) -- Now that it has labor peace, US Airways
moved Monday to try and win back customers scared off by the
prospect of a strike.
</P>
<P>
   The Arlington-based arline announced what it calls ''special
discount sale fares'' for travel in the U.S., Canada, Europe and
the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   Among the discounted fares being offered are a $258 round trip
between Baltimore and San Francisco, and a $159 round trip from
Washington, D.C. to Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   Travel dates vary by ticket type, but all tickets have to be
purchased at least seven days before departing
</P>
<P>
   US Airways also announced it will award double frequent-flier
miles on all flights through May 15.
</P>
<P>
   The carrier and its 10,000 unionized flight attendants reached a
contract agreement Saturday. The union had been threatening a
series of surprise strikes, which prompted US Airways to threaten
to ground all of its planes.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of US Airways rose 10 percent Monday -- the first trading
day after the settlement -- increasing $2.25 to $24.62{ in trading
on the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> ABC: 79 Million Watch Oscars  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- An estimated 79 million Americans watched at
least some of the lengthy Academy Awards telecast, with the average
audience slightly larger than last year, Nielsen Media Research
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The show had a 29.2 rating and 48 household share. The average
audience tuning in to at least part of the telecast was 46.3
million people.
</P>
<P>
   With ''American Beauty'' and its lead actor, Kevin Spacey,
winning the big awards, the Oscar telecast stretched to more than
four hours. That came despite promises from producers to move
things along.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, when ''Shakespeare in Love'' was the best movie, the
Academy Awards had a 28.6 rating and 46 share, with an average
audience of 45.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   ABC officials were somewhat surprised to find the national
ratings up slightly. Earlier on Monday, the overnight ratings based
on measurements from the nation's top metropolitan areas forecast a
small decline in viewership.
</P>
<P>
   The Oscars are traditionally the highest-rated entertainment
special of the year, with fluctuations in viewership dependent on
the popularity of its honored movies. For instance, 55 million
people watched part of the Oscar show when ''Titanic'' won the big
awards in 1998, while 40 million people saw ''The English Patient''
named top movie in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The show stretched well past midnight on the East Coast, but the
late hours didn't significantly affect viewership. Nielsen reported
that there were still more than 39 million people watching after
midnight.
</P>
<P>
   A rating point represents 1,008,000 households, or 1 percent of
the nation's estimated 100.8 million TV homes. The share is the
percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given show.

<HEADLINE> Closing Arguments in Tobacco Trial  </HEADLINE>
By CATHERINE WILSON, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- The tobacco industry cleverly suckered three young
people into smoking, their lawyer charged during closing arguments
Monday in the compensatory-damages phase of a trial that could be
the gravest threat yet to Big Tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   The jury last summer concluded that the nation's five biggest
cigarette makers conspired to make a deadly product.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the jury is being asked award damages to cover the
medical bills and pain and suffering for the three smokers, who
represent an estimated 500,000 sick Florida smokers in the first
class-action case against the tobacco industry ever to go to trial.
</P>
<P>
   It's the next question that could be the killer for Big Tobacco:
The jury will be asked to set a dollar figure to punish the tobacco
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Industry officials fear a ruinous $300 billion punitive damage
verdict.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate case in San Francisco on Monday, a jury ordered
two of the top cigarette makers to pay $20 million in punitive
damages to a dying smoker. The jury earlier awarded the woman $1.7
million in compensatory damages.
</P>
<P>
   In the Florida case, the industry was expected to begin its
closing arguments late Tuesday or Wednesday and take two days.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're abounding in fictions when we're dealing with the
tobacco industry,'' smokers' attorney Stanley Rosenblatt told the
six-member jury Monday. ''They were clever and they suckered all
three of these people, and that's what they intended.''
</P>
<P>
   The industry has offered evidence that bronchioalveolar cancer --
a form of lung cancer that the jury decided is not linked to
smoking -- was the culprit in the illness of Mary Farnan, who smoked
for 29 years, and in the death of Angie Della Vecchia, who smoked
for 40.
</P>
<P>
   It blamed wood dust as a possible cause of cancer in the third
plaintiff, Frank Amodeo, an Orlando clock maker who smoked for 34
years.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses for the plaintiffs testified that their cancers were
caused by smoking.
</P>
<P>
   The attorneys, the companies and the smokers are barred by a gag
order from discussing the case outside of court. A hearing on a
news media lawsuit challenging the order originally set for Monday
was rescheduled for late Tuesday in federal court.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants are Philip Morris Inc., R.J. Reynolds Tobacco
Co., Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Corp., Lorillard Tobacco Co.,
Liggett Group Inc. and the industry's Council for Tobacco Research
and Tobacco Institute.

<HEADLINE> Israeli-Palestinian Talks Closing  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Israel and the Palestinian Authority are to
conclude eight days of negotiations on Tuesday with little to show
in the way of results except a decision to reconvene here in a few
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't say that anything has been achieved in this round of
negotiations,'' Hassan Abdel Rahman, who heads the PLO office in
Washington, told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   But Israeli Embassy spokesman Mark Regev said, ''When we started
this round of negotiations no one expected historic
breakthroughs.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We were hoping for a week of concentrated and intensive
negotiations in which areas of agreement and disagreement could be
ascertained so as to better prepare a future possible summit of the
principals,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Within the last few days, steps have been taken toward those
goals,'' Regev added.
</P>
<P>
   Still on the table after the private deliberations at Bolling
Air Force Base are the issues that must be part of an overall
settlement and the details of Israel's next scheduled pullback on
the West Bank in June.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides are aiming at Sept. 13 as the deadline for
deciding the future of Jerusalem -- the Palestinians want part of
the city as a capital -- and whether Israel will consent to the
establishment of a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our assessment of the talks is that they have been serious,
intensive and, indeed, productive,'' the State Department's deputy
spokesman James B. Foley said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiators will return in a few weeks, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright had three Israeli and
three Palestinian negotiators to her office for a half-hour report.
''It was meant to underscore (that) this process has high priority
for us,'' Foley said.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides describe the talks as positive, he said.
</P>
<P>
   On a parallel track, Israel and Syria have not met since
mid-January. And President Clinton was unable on Sunday to find a
way to pry the talks open in a meeting in Geneva, Switzerland, with
Syrian President Hafez Assad.

<HEADLINE> P&AMP;G Seeks Bids for Oxydol Brand  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI (AP) -- The Procter &AMP; Gamble Co. is soliciting offers
for its Oxydol brand laundry detergent, a mainstay of the consumer
products giant since 1927.
</P>
<P>
   ''Although Oxydol is a highly profitable and recognized brand,
it is no longer a strategic fit for us,'' Paul Polman, president of
P&AMP;G's Global Fabric Care division, said Monday. ''We are putting
more focus against building brands that offer the greatest
potential for global growth.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cincinnati-based P&AMP;G, which also owns the top-selling
detergent Tide, said it would retain the Oxydol brand if it does
not get an acceptable offer.
</P>
<P>
   The company made a similar move last week when it sought bids
for some of its shortening and cooking oil brands used in
restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of P&AMP;G fell 18} cents to $54.18} in trading at 4:30 p.m.
on the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Friendly Ice Cream closing 150 restaurants  </HEADLINE>
By TRUDY TYNAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILBRAHAM, Mass. (AP) -- Friendly Ice Cream Corp. announced
Monday that it was closing nearly a quarter of the 604 Friendly's
restaurants in an attempt to boost returns.
</P>
<P>
   The company said 80 underperforming restaurants in 12 states
were shut immediately and another 70 would be closed over the next
two years. Twelve of the closed restaurants are on Long Island, one
is in Rockaway, Queens and three are in Westchester County.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a crucial step towards strengthening the company's
core restaurant business,'' said Donald N. Smith, chairman and
chief executive officer, who organized a buyout of the publicly
held company from Hershey Foods in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   The 65-year-old chain is also eliminating 110 administrative and
managerial jobs, including 40 out of a total of 400 at its
corporate headquarters in this Springfield suburb.
</P>
<P>
   The restaurant workers would be offered jobs at other nearby
restaurants owned by the chain, said Vivian Brooks, a company
spokeswoman. ''All are within a mile or two of other Friendly's
restaurants,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The 80 closed restaurants had average sales of $520,000 last
year compared to average sales for the chain as a whole of
$958,000, she said. Excluding the closed restaurants, Friendly's
restaurants had average sales of $1.1 million in 1999, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a weeding out, but this is a company that is in trouble
with its performance and they are taking steps to produce a return
on investments,'' said Richard Papiernik, financial editor of
Nation's Restaurant News, a trade publication.
</P>
<P>
   Friendly's isn't alone, he said.
</P>
<P>
   With some notable exceptions, the entire ''family dining''
segment of the restaurant business, including such chains as
Friendly's and Denny's, has been struggling for the past two years,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, they have been squeezed by competition from
fast-food and ''casual dining'' chains, such as Applebee's and
Chili's, which offer additional amenities at a slight increase in
price, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Friendly's reported total revenues of $709 million during 1999,
up from $678 million in 1998, and a net income of $400,000 or 5
cents a share for 1999, compared to a loss of $5 million or 67
cents a share for 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Friendly's sold 29 of its restaurants in New York to
a franchisee based in Rochester, N.Y. Currently about 100 of its
604 restaurants are owned by franchisees.
</P>
<P>
   The restaurants closed Monday were are all company owned and
included 27 in New York, 12 in Connecticut, 11 each in
Massachusetts and Ohio, five each in New Jersey and Pennsylvania,
three in Maryland, two in Rhode Island, and one each in Florida,
New Hampshire, Virginia and Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it expected an $18 million pretax write-down of
property and equipment and a $12 million restructuring charge in
the first quarter, because of the closings and an additional $8
million pretax savings because of its headquarters restructuring.
</P>
<P>
   The company did not release the locations of the 70 additional
restaurants that are to be closed. The company operates restaurants
in 15 states.

<HEADLINE> GOP May Add $4B for Defense Spending  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Republican leaders have opened the door
to tacking $4 billion for additional Pentagon spending to a $9
billion bill to finance U.S. efforts in Colombia and Kosovo, House
aides said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   When the House debates the spending bill Wednesday, pro-defense
legislators will be allowed to offer an amendment to add the extra
military funds, said GOP aides, who spoke on condition of
anonymity. The amendment, with the support of House Speaker Dennis
Hastert, R-Ill., and other GOP leaders, and the overall bill are
expected to be approved, the aides said.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, for the fiscal year that runs through Sept. 30,
faces an uncertain fate in the Senate. The majority leader, Sen.
Trent Lott, R-Miss., considers the price tag too big.
</P>
<P>
   House leaders want to plow ahead anyway in hopes of reaching
agreement with the Senate, if even for a pared-down bill, aides
said. The extra defense money could be a chit for such
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The added defense money also is aimed at satisfying House
defense hawks. In behind-the-scenes efforts last week that
ultimately failed, they tried to add $15 billion to the $307
billion included for the military last week in the overall budget
for 2001, which begins Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   With their support, the House approved the budget Friday by a
211-207 margin. It contains $307 billion for defense, about $17
billion more than this year.
</P>
<P>
   The extra money is to be for Pentagon readiness and health-care
expenses, said an aide. Additional details were not immediately
available.
</P>
<P>
   Although the extra Pentagon funds would make pro-defense
legislators happy, it would further incense many other
conservatives who have said that even the $9 billion version of the
legislation is too expensive.
</P>
<P>
   ''They've thrown everything but the kitchen sink into this''
bill, said conservative Rep. Pete Hoekstra, R-Mich., ''and it looks
like they're getting close to throwing the kitchen sink in as
well.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Pentagon, the bill already contains $2 billion for costs
of U.S. peacekeepers in Kosovo; $1.6 billion for the military's
higher-than-expected fuel bill; and $854 million for the Pentagon's
embattled health-insurance system.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also has $2.2 billion for recovery costs from last
autumn's Hurricane Floyd and other domestic natural disasters, $1.7
billion to help the Colombian government's battle against drug
traffickers and its left- and right-wing allies, and other items.
</P>
<P>
   Lott has said he would prefer to scrap the legislation. He would
provide money for Colombia and Kosovo instead in spending bills
Congress will consider later this year for 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete Domenici,
R-N.M., has all but settled a dispute with conservatives that had
delayed his plans to push a $1.8 trillion budget for 2001 through
his committee. The panel will begin considering the spending plan
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, a leader of the conservative group and
a member of the committee, had demanded procedural controls on
spending as the price for his vote. Without it, Domenici could not
push his budget through the committee, where unanimous Democratic
opposition is expected.
</P>
<P>
   Among procedures Domenici and Gramm agreed to is a $14 billion
limit on spending included in the 2001 budget that would count as
spending for 2002, not 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Crediting spending to a later year is a way of easing spending
pressure in a budget. The budget for fiscal 2000 counted $23
billion toward 2001. The House-approved budget for 2001 also would
allow up to $23 billion to be counted in 2002.

<HEADLINE> Life Sentence in Bounty-Hunter Case  </HEADLINE>
BY ELISA BONGIOVANNI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- A man who murdered a couple after posing as a
bounty hunter was sentenced Monday to life in prison without the
possibility of parole.
</P>
<P>
   David Brackney, 47, was one of five masked men who claimed to be
in search of a California bail jumper when they burst into the
couple's home in August 1997, according to prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Foote, 25, shot at the men as they tried to break
down his bedroom door. Brackney and the group's ringleader, Michael
Sanders, then fatally shot Foote and Spring Wright, 19, in the
couple's bed, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers claimed the men were on a legitimate bounty
hunting mission. But prosecutors noted that the bond they claimed
to be enforcing had expired and said bounty hunting was used merely
as a ruse to ransack Foote's house.
</P>
<P>
   The killings prompted a new Arizona law requiring bounty hunters
to be licensed and to get permission from a home's occupants before
entering
</P>
<P>
   Tom Foote Sr., Christopher Foote's father, said he was ''tickled
to death'' with Brackney's sentence: two consecutive life terms for
the murders plus 90 years for other felony charges.
</P>
<P>
   ''It won't bring my son back, but at least we are getting
justice,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders was sentenced last year to two consecutive life prison
terms while another defendant pleaded guilty to second-degree
murder and awaits sentencing. The two other men, including
Brackney's 22-year-old son Matthew, are awaiting trial.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Off 86.87; Nasdaq Off 4.47  </HEADLINE>
By EILEEN GLANTON, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Microsoft deflated every major stock market
index Monday, falling sharply after the government reportedly
rejected the company's offer to settle their antitrust case.
Microsoft's decline masked strength in other technology issues.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average fell 86.87 to close at
11,025.85. The blue-chip index lost an early gain due to
Microsoft's weakness and profit-taking in the financial shares that
soared last week.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index fell 4.47 to 4,958.56, and the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 fell 3.60 to 1,523.86. Trading was quiet.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, the most actively traded Nasdaq stock, fell 7| to 104
1/16, accounting for nearly 40 points of the Dow's decline. Sources
have told The Associated Press that government lawyers have
concluded Microsoft's offer to settle their antitrust case was
inadequate, and they are preparing for U.S. District Judge Thomas
Penfield Jackson to deliver a verdict as early as Tuesday. Jackson
has previously hinted he will rule against Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Microsoft shares rose as much as 12 percent amid
reports the company was nearing a settlement with the government.
</P>
<P>
   ''Microsoft ran way up in anticipation of some good news over
the weekend,'' said Scott Bleier, chief investment strategist at
Prime Charter Ltd. ''Did it get ahead of itself? Yes. Investors are
still waiting to see what the government has to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Many other technology companies advanced.
</P>
<P>
   IBM rose 6\ to 126~ after Morgan Stanley Dean Witter raised its
rating on the stock from ''neutral'' to ''outperform.'' Cisco
Systems gained 11/16 to 80 1/16 and Sun Microsystems rose 4} to 105
as portfolio managers scrambled to add them to their portfolios
before the end of the first quarter on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The stocks that are the institutional favorites continue to
power higher,'' Bleier said. ''There's a major markup of large-cap
technology stocks.''
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks before companies begin reporting their
first-quarter earnings, technology stocks are likely to lead the
market as investors buy them on the promise of strong earnings
growth, said John H. Shaughnessy, chief investment strategist at
Advest Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe stock selection should continue to focus on those
companies with strong earnings momentum,'' he said. ''This would
include technology stocks.''
</P>
<P>
   The earnings reporting season will gather momentum in mid-April.
Until then, traders said the market may stay in a fairly narrow
trading range with no clear catalyst to spark a major swing in
either direction.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of oil producers traded actively as OPEC oil ministers
adjourned the first session of their meeting in Vienna without
reaching an agreement on production increases. OPEC members are
considering raising production by 1.5 million to 1.7 million
barrels a day, which would bring oil prices down from nine-year
highs.
</P>
<P>
   Exxon Mobil fell 47/64 to 76 33/64 and BP Amoco was down 1| to
49.
</P>
<P>
   Investment bank Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette dropped 9 9/16 to
57} after Morgan Stanley Dean Witter analyst Henry McVey downgraded
the stock to ''neutral'' from ''outperform.'' McVey cited concerns
that DLJ may have reached a peak in valuation.
</P>
<P>
   Other financial stocks, which rose after the Federal Reserve
announced its decision to raise interest rates modestly last
Tuesday, fell as investors took profits. American Express was down
5[ at 150{. Goldman Sachs fell 9 5/16 to 112.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 4-to-3 margin on the
NYSE, where consolidated volume totaled 1.10 billion shares,
compared with 1.25 billion in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 0.36 to 573.65.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 1.1 percent.
Germany's DAX index fell 0.5 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 lost 0.8
percent, and France's CAC-40 closed 1.4 percent higher.

<HEADLINE> Congress May Compromise on HMOs  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID ESPO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congressional negotiators have made quiet
progress toward agreement on an appeals process for patients who
contend they were wrongly denied care by their HMO, a key
unresolved issue on a broader health bill, officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said staff
aides for Republicans and Democrats worked through the weekend and
during the day Monday. The goal was to forge an agreement on the
issue for presentation to lawmakers within a few days, they added.
</P>
<P>
   With no guarantee of success, negotiators are trying to draft
language to serve as a standard for use in determining whether a
denial of care should be reversed.
</P>
<P>
   In general, aides are discussing a two-step appeals process. The
first step would be under auspices of the HMO. A second, open to
some but not all patients whose internal appeals were denied, would
be conducted by an independent expert.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional aides in both parties said negotiators had not yet
agreed in what circumstances, if any, an independent reviewer
should be able to order coverage as medical necessity, even if it
were not required in the HMO's contract. Negotiators also were
trying to agree on a timetable for reviews.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not done, but there's been some progress,'' said Dennis
Fitzgibbons, a spokesman for Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich. He said
''nothing is secured'' until all points are in agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are making progress,'' said Gayle Osterberg, an aide Sen.
Don Nickles, R-Okla., who is chairing the formal House-Senate
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Sen. Edward M. Kennedy and Rep. Bill Thomas said they
had no information to offer.
</P>
<P>
   The HMO measure is one of the most contentious and political
important issues before Congress. President Clinton and many
Democrats favor legislation to grant numerous federal protections
to all Americans with private health insurance. Republicans
generally favor fewer federal protections, for a smaller group of
insured.
</P>
<P>
   The political situation is complicated, however, in that
dissident Republicans joined with Democrats and approved the White
House-blessed bill in the House.
</P>
<P>
   Aides in both parties said resolution of a review process could
be critical to passage of an overall deal on so-called ''patients
bill of rights'' legislation. One Democrat expressed surprise at
how forthcoming Republicans have been in seeking compromise in
recent days. Two Republicans suggested that resolution of the
external review snag would clear the way for further compromises.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, aides to lawmakers in both parties talked of a
possible tradeoff between Republican-backed provisions to make
health care more affordable and accessible on the one hand, and the
Democratic desire to extend patient protections to all Americans
with insurance.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, officials said compromise on a right to sue might
also become more feasible.
</P>
<P>
   The current round of discussions began Thursday as Republicans
presented an outline to Democrats for both an internal and external
review.
</P>
<P>
   Key lawmakers are tentatively scheduled to meet Thursday to
review staff-drafted compromises on access to care by specialists
and continuity of care after a patient's doctor has been dropped by
an HMO or a patient's employer has switched HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators earlier agreed on access to emergency room care.

<HEADLINE> Davidians: Suit Should Include Agent  </HEADLINE>
By MICHELLE MITTELSTADT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- An FBI sharpshooter who is the only named
defendant in the wrongful-death lawsuit filed against the federal
government by relatives of Branch Davidians killed in the 1993 Waco
siege should not be dismissed from the case, one set of Davidians
said in a court filing Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the plaintiffs, who are represented by lead counsel
Michael Caddell, moved earlier this month to dismiss their case
against Lon Horiuchi, saying there was ''no credible'' evidence he
fired shots at the Davidians.
</P>
<P>
   But another group of Davidians, represented by former Attorney
General Ramsey Clark, said in a filing Monday in federal court in
Waco, Texas, that it would be ''premature'' to dismiss Horiuchi,
who gained notoriety in 1992 when he killed the wife of white
separatist Randy Weaver during a standoff at Ruby Ridge, Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   ''The facts are not fully known and are being developed,'' the
motion says, noting the government's conduct at Waco remains under
''intense investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It may well turn out that government agents fired at Branch
Davidians on April 19, 1993, and engaged in other serious
misconduct, including coverup and spoliation of evidence,'' the
Clark-represented group contends, offering no evidence to back up
their charges.
</P>
<P>
   Horiuchi's government lawyers say there is not a ''shred of
evidence'' he fired his weapon on April 19.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials say their agents fired no shots on the final
day of the seven-week siege, which ended when the Davidians'
retreat erupted into flames several hours into an FBI tear-gas
operation.
</P>
<P>
   Davidian leader David Koresh and some 80 followers died during
the inferno, some from the fire, others from gunshot wounds. The
government contends they died by their own hand.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs, whose civil suit goes to trial in mid-May, argue
that FBI infrared surveillance tapes taken during the final hours
offer definitive proof of government gunfire into the building as
it burned -- a charge the government denies.
</P>
<P>
   The Caddell-represented plaintiffs, in moving to dismiss
Horiuchi, said a forensic analysis of spent shell casings found at
the outpost occupied by Horiuchi's sniper team indicate the bullets
were ''most likely'' fired by agents of the Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms during the initial Feb. 28 gun battle that
began the 51-day siege.
</P>
<P>
   Separately Monday, the government asked U.S. District Judge
Walter Smith for temporary custody of the FBI's 1993 infrared
videotapes, which currently are in the hands of Waco special
counsel John Danforth. The move follows Caddell's accusation that
some of the evidence turned over by the government has been
withheld, tampered with or destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Although many of the allegations are baseless on their face,
in order to respond, the United States must have its own experts
examine the (Forward Looking Infrared) videotapes,'' the motion
says.

<HEADLINE> Report: French Colonel Under Fire  </HEADLINE>
By PIERRE-ANTOINE SOUCHARD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- A French colonel was detained Monday on suspicion
he had leaked state secrets to the media about French peacekeepers
in the troubled Yugoslav province of Kosovo, judicial sources said.
</P>
<P>
   The classified documents described bitterness among some
peacekeepers toward Bernard Kouchner, U.N. administrator for
Kosovo. They also highlighted rifts within French forces in Kosovo
-- between the army and the gendarmerie, a national police forced
controlled by the Defense Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   Jean-Michel Mechain, a colonel in the gendarmerie, was placed in
provisional detention and under investigation for ''divulging a
secret pertinent to national defense,'' according to judicial
sources who spoke on customary condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   If found guilty, Mechain, 46, could face seven years in prison
and a fine of $104,000. Mechain has said he is not guilty of
leaking the documents, and has not yet been formally charged in the
case.
</P>
<P>
   Mechain's lawyer said Monday he would appeal the detention
order, probably before the end of this week. ''Placing someone in
detention for an intellectual offense is a monstrosity,'' lawyer
William Bourdon said.
</P>
<P>
   Mechain was the ''victim of a political-military controversy,''
Bourdon said.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper Le Monde reported Monday that Mechain planned to
ask that his military obligation to keep silent be lifted so that
he can defend himself against all accusations.
</P>
<P>
   A judicial inquiry was launched just over a week ago to find out
how two French weeklies got hold of the classified papers.
</P>
<P>
   According to the documents, Kouchner, who is French, was
perceived by French officers in Kosovo as anti-Serb and
pro-Albanian. The accounts were published in February by the news
magazine Le Point and the satirical newspaper Le Canard Enchaine.
</P>
<P>
   Mechain, a former judicial counselor to a French general in
Pristina, was abruptly recalled from Kosovo in mid-February.
Defense Minister Alain Richard said last week that ''there were
reasons not to keep him there,'' but did not specify those reasons.
</P>
<P>
   The colonel, who was judicial counselor to a French general in
Pristina, was detained for questioning on Friday, just days after a
bizarre street brawl linked to the leaks.
</P>
<P>
   A French female translator of Albanian origin, who had worked
with Mechain in Kosovo, was also held for questioning but released
on Saturday, judicial sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Newspaper reports have said the woman, like the colonel, is a
prime suspect in the leaks.
</P>
<P>
   Mechain came to blows last Monday night with investigators from
the Army's Defense Protection and Security unit, who were tailing
him as part of an internal inquiry into the leaks.
</P>
<P>
   Mechain filed a complaint after he was struck by one of the
eight men tailing him as he walked the woman home. Mechain struck
back, leading to two judicial complaints.

<HEADLINE> Ball Park Hot Dogs Recalled  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Sara Lee Corp. has recalled 34,500 pounds
of Ball Park-brand hot dogs because they might be contaminated with
bacteria that can cause life-threatening infections.
</P>
<P>
   No illnesses have been reported in connection with the hot dogs,
Sara Lee spokeswoman Theresa Herlevsen said Monday. The recall was
ordered after a military laboratory found listeria monocytogenes in
hot dogs that had been distributed to an Army commissary, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The hot dogs, which were packaged Jan. 25 at a plant in
Philadelphia, were distributed to commissaries and retail
establishments in Florida, Missouri, New York, Virginia, Ohio,
Connecticut, Oklahoma, Delaware, Kansas, Nebraska, Texas,
Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Massachusetts and Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   The packages bear the code ''APR03 EST 12PAB.''
</P>
<P>
   An outbreak of listeria poisoning in 1998 that killed 15 people
and sickened at least 100 more was traced to meat processed at a
Sara Lee plant in Zeeland, Mich. Some 15 million pounds of hot dogs
and lunch meats were recalled by the company.
</P>
<P>
   Listeria can cause fever, severe headaches, stiffness, nausea
and diarrhea. Healthy people recover quickly, but listeria can
cause serious, sometimes fatal, infections in children, the elderly
and people with weak immune systems, and is especially dangerous
for pregnant women. It can cause miscarriages and stillbirths even
if the mother experiences no symptoms.

<HEADLINE> Calif. GOP Group Going After Gore  </HEADLINE>
By LAURA MECKLER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In the latest effort to influence the
presidential race via secret contributors, a group of high-profile
California Republicans is running TV ads calling Vice President Al
Gore a hypocrite on campaign finance and other issues.
</P>
<P>
   Former California Gov. Pete Wilson is raising money for the new
group, Shape the Debate, which began airing the ads Monday. They
will run on cable TV for a month across California, and in New York
and Washington, said George Gorton, a veteran Republican consultant
who leads the group.
</P>
<P>
   The ads are the opening volley from outside groups looking to
influence the election that pits Democrat Gore against Republican
George W. Bush. Federal law allows interest groups to air ads for
or against candidates as long as the commercials do not advocate
their election or defeat. These groups also are not required to
identify their financial backers.
</P>
<P>
   Gorton would not say who is funding the group, which he said has
raised $1.5 million. Its Web site notes that contributions are
unlimited, can come from any source and will not be made public.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the group's organizers support Bush. Its attorney, Vigo
G. Nielsen, gave $1,000 to Bush's campaign, as did Patrick Shea,
one of two board members.
</P>
<P>
   Gorton said donors fear they would face retaliation if they were
known to be criticizing the vice president. He said he has not
consulted with Bush or his campaign, which would render the ads an
illegal campaign contribution.
</P>
<P>
   The ads began appearing the same day that Gore unveiled a
campaign finance proposal that would require groups such as this to
disclose their donors if they advertise within 60 days of an
election.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is exactly the type of shady politics that is having a
very negative effect on democracy,'' said Gore spokesman Chris
Lehane.
</P>
<P>
   Shape the Debate hopes to raise another $2 million to $3 million
for another round of spots later this spring, principally in
California, a crucial state in the fall election, Gorton said. Its
two-member board is made up of former Rep. Bill Lowery and Shea,
both high-profile California Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The ad hits a theme that is strikingly similar to a Bush
campaign mantra: Gore's trustworthiness.
</P>
<P>
   Patterned after the game show ''Jeopardy!,'' the 30-second spot
pretends to be a show called ''Hypocrisy.'' A contestant chooses
''political hypocrites for 200'' and is told: ''He says he supports
campaign finance reform, but held an illegal fund raiser at a
Buddhist Temple.'' The answer is ''Who is Al Gore?''
</P>
<P>
   Two similar questions poke at Gore's statements on tobacco and
Medicare spending cuts. The ad doesn't mention that the Medicare
cuts Gore supported were smaller than the cuts backed by
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The ad is airing about 30 times each week in New York,
Washington and four large California markets -- Los Angeles,
Sacramento, San Diego and San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Groups across the political spectrum also have tried to
influence the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   During the primaries, a pair of Texas businessmen calling
themselves Republicans for Clean Air aired pro-Bush ads. From the
left, the Sierra Club and the National Abortion and Reproductive
Rights Action League also have gone after Bush.

<HEADLINE> Badgers Start Focusing on Spartans  </HEADLINE>
By JENNY PRICE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADISON, Wis. (AP) -- Wisconsin played Michigan State three times
this season and lost all three times. The Badgers get one more
crack, only now the winner gets to play for the national
championship.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Dick Bennett is blunt about what it means to be playing
against coach Tom Izzo and the Spartans yet again.
</P>
<P>
   ''Pain ... misery,'' Bennett said. ''Once the game starts, I
think we have the toughest opponent in America. We still have not
been able to solve all of the problems they present.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Badgers are excited or overwhelmed at the prospect of
facing the top-seeded Spartans on a national stage, they're not
showing it. While meeting with reporters in Madison on Monday, the
Badgers acted as though they expected to be in this extraordinary
situation all along.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's just another game,'' said forward Andy Kowske. ''It's
like Purdue. They know you, you know them. ... It's a matter of who
puts the ball in the hoop more.''
</P>
<P>
   The eighth-seeded Badgers, along with No. 8 seed North Carolina,
became the lowest-seeded team to make the Final Four since LSU in
1986. Wisconsin (22-13) beat Purdue on Saturday for the third time
this season, 64-60, to win the NCAA West Regional.
</P>
<P>
   The Badgers have had a much tougher time with Michigan State,
which is returning to the Final Four for the second straight year.
Though the Spartans never embarrassed Wisconsin, each of the three
wins was convincing.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's tough when you have a team that has a lot of different
options like Michigan State does, especially when you have a strong
leader like Mateen (Cleaves) who can take over the game and really
control the tempo,'' said Mike Kelley, selected to the all-West
Regional team after averaging 4.3 steals a game.
</P>
<P>
   ''They don't get credit for their defense a lot. It's so strong
that it's very difficult to run an offense against them. It wears
you down and takes a little bit away from our defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Bennett said Michigan State will present the toughest defense
the Badgers have seen in the tournament. Wisconsin shot just 34.6
percent in its three losses to Michigan State.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've never shot the ball well against them because they cut
your comfort space down,'' he said. ''You don't have space and you
don't have time.''
</P>
<P>
   Kowske said Wisconsin's familiarity with Michigan State should
help.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't have to watch any extra tape. We know what we're
going up against,'' he said. ''We've shown this year we can play
with them. It might be tough to beat us four times in a row.''
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin's 55-46 loss to Michigan State in the Big Ten
tournament was the Badgers' only loss in their last 10 games. In a
regular-season loss at East Lansing, the Badgers outrebounded the
Spartans 29-26, becoming the only team to outrebound Michigan State
to that point.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was a fluke,'' Bennett said. ''I don't think we could
outrebound our women's team on a consistent basis.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Bennett said his players' attitude has been unwavering no
matter who they have played.
</P>
<P>
   ''These guys are bulldogs. They won't admit defeat. They won't
feel second-rate ever. They won't allow themselves to think that
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Bennett and his team say the excitement of the school's best
season in a half-century won't take them out of their routine.
Badgermania reached its peak when a welcome-home party of 20,000
fans at Camp Randall Stadium on Saturday night stretched into
Sunday morning, with fans hanging from light posts and marching
from campus through Madison's downtown.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's great to have the attention, but you still have to play
the basketball game,'' Kowske said. ''We're not going to let it go
to our head.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   YELLOWKNIFE, Canada (AP) -- An 18-month-old toddler escaped with
minor injuries after falling from a third-floor hotel window onto
asphalt in the capital of Canada's sprawling Northwest Territory.
</P>
<P>
   The toddler apparently fell after climbing onto the window ledge
to look outside on Saturday, in this town on the shore of the great
Slave Lake, 1,800 miles north of Toronto. The window was open and
when the child leaned on the screen it came free of the rails,
causing both the screen and the child to tumble about 33 feet,
police said.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the child was properly supervised and the fall has
been ruled accidental.

   YELLOWKNIFE, Canada (AP) -- An 18-month-old toddler escaped with
minor injuries after falling from a third-floor hotel window onto
asphalt in the capital of Canada's sprawling Northwest Territory.
</P>
<P>
   The toddler apparently fell after climbing onto the window ledge
to look outside on Saturday, in this town on the shore of the great
Slave Lake, 1,800 miles north of Toronto. The window was open and
when the child leaned on the screen it came free of the rails,
causing both the screen and the child to tumble about 33 feet,
police said.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the child was properly supervised and the fall has
been ruled accidental.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rep. Dan Burton asked the Justice Department
on Monday to appoint a special outside counsel to investigate
whether the White House engaged in obstruction by failing to
surrender e-mails in the campaign fund-raising scandal.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican chairman of the House Government Reform Committee
said the Justice Department has a conflict of interest because its
civil division lawyers are representing the White House in a
lawsuit involving the e-mails.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department cannot use its campaign fund-raising task
force ''to investigate yourself and the Justice Department lawyers
who helped keep the e-mails from being produced,'' Burton wrote
Attorney General Janet Reno. The department revealed the task
force's probe last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I call on you to appoint a Special Counsel to investigate the
obstruction of justice charges against the White House,'' said
Burton, R-Ind.
</P>
<P>
   Two White House contract employees say a presidential aide
threatened them with dismissal and jail if they revealed computer
glitches that resulted in possibly hundreds of thousands of e-mails
not being reviewed for turnover to investigators.
</P>
<P>
   The presidential aide, attorney Mark Lindsay, denied making
threats, but said he did ask the employees to keep quiet because he
didn't want them gossiping.
</P>
<P>
   A conservative group whose lawsuit revealed the e-mail problem
objected to appointment of a special counsel.
</P>
<P>
   ''Who needs a special counsel when all they ever do is fail,''
said Larry Klayman, head of Judicial Watch.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department is trying to suspend the part of
Klayman's lawsuit having to do with the e-mails so that the suit
does not interfere with the criminal probe.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department spokesman Myron Marlin said that officials
are reviewing Burton's letter to see if ''yet another investigator
is necessary.'' Independent Counsel Robert Ray also is looking into
the e-mails.

<HEADLINE> Jury Awards Ex-Smoker $20 Million  </HEADLINE>
By BOB EGELKO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A jury ordered the nation's two largest
tobacco companies Monday to pay $20 million in punitive damages to
a dying ex-smoker who took up the habit after the surgeon general's
warning began appearing on cigarette packs in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   The Superior Court jury decided 9-3 to order Philip Morris and
R.J. Reynolds to pay $10 million each to Leslie Whiteley and her
husband.
</P>
<P>
   The same jury awarded the couple $1.7 million in compensatory
damages last week after finding that the companies deceived the
public about the dangers of smoking.
</P>
<P>
   That verdict was the first time the industry lost to someone who
started smoking after 1969, when tobacco companies began putting
government-required health warnings on cigarette packs.
</P>
<P>
   Around the country, juries have awarded damages to individual
smokers only five other times. But three of those verdicts were
overturned and the two others are still under appeal. The industry
has yet to pay anything in any of those cases.
</P>
<P>
   Whiteley, 40, said she started smoking in 1972 at age 13. She
smoked Philip Morris' Marlboros and Reynolds' Camels until 1998,
when she quit shortly before doctors diagnosed small-cell lung
cancer. Doctors said she will probably die this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Whiteleys had asked for $115 million in punitive damages,
which they said would represent 1 percent of the companies'
combined net worth. Their lawyer said cigarette makers remain
unrepentant for the harm they cause.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Morris lawyer William Ohlemeyer contended that punitive
damages are improper because ''the companies have made profound
changes in the way they do business.'' He and other company lawyers
have pointed to the $206 billion settlement reached in 1998 by
cigarette makers and 46 states suing over health costs.
</P>
<P>
   He said the companies will appeal if the judge upholds the
verdict.
</P>
<P>
   The tobacco companies argued that Whiteley harmed herself by her
admitted use of marijuana, by smoking during pregnancy and by
disregarding warnings on cigarette packages.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mrs. Whiteley never smoked a pack of cigarettes that didn't
have a health warning on it that was written by the surgeon
general,'' Ohlemeyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Added Reynolds lawyer Daniel W. Donohue: ''We continue to
believe smokers have long been aware of the significant, inherent
risks of smoking, and that people who choose to smoke in the face
of these known risks should not be financially rewarded.''
</P>
<P>
   Madelyn Chaber, a lawyer for the family, countered that the
companies themselves denied knowledge of the dangers of smoking
both before and after Whiteley became addicted.
</P>
<P>
   ''Warning labels do not allow tobacco companies to tell
half-truths and misrepresentations,'' Chaber said. ''Leslie
Whiteley's greatest mistake was believing them.''
</P>
<P>
   After reviewing internal industry documents, jurors found that
the companies designed cigarettes negligently, then made false or
misleading statements to the public and concealed information about
the dangers of smoking.
</P>
<P>
   In the other smoking verdicts around the country, two cases in
Florida and one in New Jersey were overturned on appeal; an $80
million verdict in Portland, Ore., was reduced to $31 million by
the judge; and a $51 million verdict against Philip Morris in San
Francisco a year ago was cut in half by Superior Court Judge John
Munter, who is also presiding over Whiteley's case. The two West
Coast cases are still under appeal.

<HEADLINE> Jets Owner Honors Keyshawn Contract  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY WILNER, AP Football Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Woody Johnson, the new owner of the New
York Jets, believes in the sanctity of a contract. That means he
thinks star receiver Keyshawn Johnson shouldn't be threatening a
holdout.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is a member of the team and has a contract with the team,''
Woody Johnson said Monday at the NFL's annual meetings. ''I think
contracts are a part of this society and contracts are important.
</P>
<P>
   ''You promise to do something and sign an agreement and you can
take that for what it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Monday, coach Al Groh reiterated the team's intent not
to trade Keyshawn Johnson, who has two years remaining on his
contract. Nor do the Jets plan to renegotiate.
</P>
<P>
   The receiver believes he is underpaid and his agent, Jerome
Stanley, has cited the seven-year, $42 million contract Dallas gave
Joey Galloway, whose career numbers are similar to Johnson's.
</P>
<P>
   Keyshawn Johnson's deal averaged $2 million for the next two
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley sounded surprised when told of Woody Johnson's comments,
and had no comment.
</P>
<P>
   New York's offseason conditioning program has begun and Keyshawn
has not reported. The team has its first veterans' minicamp in May,
and unless progress is made on a new contract, it is unlikely the
receiver will attend.
</P>
<P>
   Woody Johnson has said he will leave all football decisions to
the likes of chief of operations Bill Parcells and Groh. He also
emphasized how close to the salary cap limit the Jets are, although
reportedly they have $2 million to spend. Of course, most of that
money must go to draft choices, including the team's two
first-rounders.
</P>
<P>
   ''We like Keyshawn, he is a great player. He is an impact
player,'' the owner said. ''But I don't think anyone can break a
season or a team.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Johnson wasn't involved in the NFL last year, he can be
excused for overlooking how the Jets' season was ruined when
quarterback Vinny Testaverde tore his Achilles' tendon in the
opening game. The same thing happened in Atlanta when Jamal
Anderson was hurt, and in Denver when John Elway retired.
</P>
<P>
   The owner was asked about the distractions created when a team's
best player threatens a holdout.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our job is to provide and field the best team and create
incentives for the team to achieve success,'' he said. ''I don't
think it is up to one player to determine if we fail or succeed.''

<HEADLINE> Senate to amend bill forcing parents to pay if kid sounds falsealarm  </HEADLINE>
By NANCY PARELLO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Parents, not taxpayers, should foot the
bill when their child sounds a false alarm, calling out bomb
squads, fire trucks and police, a state Senator said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But, there should also be an exception for parents who have done
everything right -- and still managed to raise an incorrigible
child, said Sen. John Matheussen, R-Gloucester.
</P>
<P>
   So, Matheussen decided to hold his bill, which was up for a
Senate vote Monday, that would have allowed towns and school
districts to sue parents for the cost of responding to a false bomb
threat, fire alarm or call to 911.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm going to work to see if we can come up with some form of a
compromise,'' said Matheussen. ''There are exceptions, and
sometimes a parent can do all they possibly can do, and yet still a
child goes wrong. And we want to make some exceptions for when that
happens.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, taxpayers should not have to pay when parents
neglect their responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   ''When that false alarm is pulled and that bomb scare goes off,
your taxpayers are paying, on average, about $7,500 for that one
day,'' Matheussen told his fellow senators. ''Now parents aren't
responsible, but taxpayers are.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill comes at a time when false alarms in schools are
increasing -- along with a rising cry for parents to be held
accountable for their children's actions.
</P>
<P>
   False bomb threats more than doubled from the 1996-1997 school
year to the 1997-1998 school year, going from 74 to 173, according
to Peter Peretzman, spokesman for the state education department.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason for the increase was a spate of bogus threats
in one Camden County school district, Peretzman said, but he
couldn't say exactly how much of the increase was due to that one
district's troubles.
</P>
<P>
   Some think making parents pay is a good idea.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a cost,'' said Kenneth Trump, president of the
National School Safety and Security Service in Cleveland, Ohio.
''It's lost instructional time. It's heightened fear and panic.
It's costing you to mobilize the police. There should be some cost
attached to it and there should be a strong effort to make somebody
pay for it, whether it's the offender or the parent.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank Belluscio, spokesman for the New Jersey School Boards
Association, said the association supports the measure, calling it
a natural extension of a 20-year-old court decision that allowed
school districts to seek restitution for vandalism.
</P>
<P>
   ''If a district closes for a day and loses the services of its
staff, that can be costly,'' said Belluscio.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Muniz, security chief in the Willingboro School District,
said students often don't realize that what they're doing is
against the law. Since September, the Burlington County school
district has had 11 bomb threats or other acts of violence.
</P>
<P>
   Muniz said a law holding parents accountable would show students
the seriousness of sounding a false alarm and could prevent some
kids from playing the prank.
</P>
<P>
   Others say there are other ways to prevent false alarms.
</P>
<P>
   Schools can take simple steps, such as installing caller I.D.,
said Trump.
</P>
<P>
   ''People are amazed to see that kids call from home or from a
pay phone in school,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   School officials should also publicize the penalties, Trump
said.
</P>
<P>
   In New Jersey, juveniles can face jail time for a bomb threat.
They can also lose their driver's license for six months -- or have
to wait an additional six months to get a license if they're under
17 when they commit the crime, said Lee Moore, spokesman for the
attorney general's office.
</P>
<P>
   Also, adults should see the prank as a signal that a child might
need help.
</P>
<P>
   ''If a kid has made a bomb threat, the most important issue is
not getting money for the bomb threat,'' said James Fiscus of the
National Resource Center for Safe Schools in Portland, Ore. ''The
most important issue is getting help for the kid. That's one of the
real warning signs of trouble with that child and potentially with
that family.''

   PEORIA, Ariz. (AP) -- Right-hander Stan Spencer's outside shot at
starting the season with the San Diego Padres ended Monday when he

<HEADLINE> Cancun Takes Mexico Out of Break  </HEADLINE>
By NIKO PRICE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CANCUN, Mexico (AP) -- Beyond the McDonald's, beyond the
Houlihan's, beyond the Papa John's Pizza, the Outback Steakhouse
and the Subway sandwiches, Cancun has a restaurant that serves
Mexican food.
</P>
<P>
   It's called Planet Hollywood, and if you look hard on the menu,
among the hamburgers and barbecued ribs there's a listing for
''Sizzling Fajitas.''
</P>
<P>
   As it quickly becomes a top Spring break destination, this
resort on Mexico's Caribbean coast is missing one element: even the
vaguest trace of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you go to vacation in Mexico, you want to get away from
it all. But this is just like back home,'' griped Matt Leiszler, a
19-year-old freshman from Harvard University.
</P>
<P>
   More than 70,000 American college students have descended on
Cancun over the past month, leading many travel agents to dub the
resort the new capital of Spring break.
</P>
<P>
   The kids eat at American restaurants, shop at American stores
and grind the night away in discos whose DJs don't stock a single
Mexican CD.
</P>
<P>
   Hosts at the nightclubs don't ask which country people are from
-- they ask which state. And the contestants at the wet T-shirt
competitions are representing places like Chicago, Los Angeles and
New York.
</P>
<P>
   Mexicans, who in general are more socially conservative than
Americans, grimace at the writhing, semi-naked bodies at the
discos.
</P>
<P>
   ''I see this as the 51st state,'' said Miko Chavez, a Mexico
City native who works as an ''animator'' at the Melia Cancun Hotel,
organizing volleyball games and dispensing pingpong paddles at the
pool.
</P>
<P>
   For many visiting Americans, the U.S.-friendly atmosphere is one
of the resort's main draws.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you're bringing kids down, they have limited repertoires
of what they can eat,'' said Tom Retzinger, a doctor from Winona,
Minn., who accompanied his high-school daughter for a bit of fun in
the sun.
</P>
<P>
   His destination: The Hard Rock Cafe.
</P>
<P>
   But some of the students complain that they came down for a
taste of Mexico -- and found nothing but America on the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   Leiszler said in his first three days in Cancun, the only
Mexicans he had a chance to talk to were the drivers of the taxis
he rode in. All spoke perfect English.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I'm going to Mexico, I'd like it to be more Mexican,'' said
Amir Redakhorshad, a 20-year-old junior at West Virginia University
in Morgantown.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason Cancun is so American is that it was built
not from a Mexican beach town -- but from nothing. Until 1970, this
L-shaped sand bar off the Yucatan Peninsula was barren.
</P>
<P>
   In a frenzy of government-sponsored construction that took place
over the screams of ecologists, Cancun has become one of the
world's top tourist destinations.
</P>
<P>
   ''Idaho in the house!'' the host screamed at one local disco as
he bent down from the stage to pour tequila into a conga line of
open mouths yelling out their hometowns.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the students said Cancun broadened their horizons by
allowing them to meet people from different places. Places like
Omaha, Nebraska, and Escanaba, Michigan, that is.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a good mixture of people,'' said Kate Roberts, a
21-year-old junior at the University of Tennessee at Knoxville.
''They come from all over the United States.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- The state's embattled high sheriffs now
have some proposed legislation on their side.
</P>
<P>
   On a 29-18 vote Monday, the Legislature's Appropriations
Committee passed to the House a bill which would maintain the
elected office of high sheriff. Other bills scheduled for debate in
the General Assembly call for a constitutional amendment that would
abolish the job.
</P>
<P>
   The bill passed Monday would make the sheriffs administrators
whose primary responsibilities would include hiring deputies and
special deputies and auditing the deputies. Currently, high
sheriffs also serve legal papers to supplement their incomes. The
bill also says the high sheriffs should get pay raises, but does
not specify how much the increases should be.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also would create Council of High Sheriffs, composed of
the eight elected sheriffs. The council would oversee the system
and set up training programs and standard procedures.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers who want to dismantle the county sheriff system say it
is riddled with corruption and patronage, and want the jobs
performed by deputies and special deputies to be controlled by
state agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Special deputies guard courthouses and transport prisoners.
Deputies serve legal papers such as subpoenas and summonses.
</P>
<P>
   Several scandals during the past year have shaken the sheriffs
system, and two high sheriffs have pleaded innocent to criminal
charges.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the sheriffs say getting rid of the system isn't
the answer.
</P>
<P>
   ''If something goes wrong, we should try to fix it,'' said Rep.
William Dyson, D-New Haven, co-chairman of Appropriations. ''We
shouldn't rectify problems just by getting rid of a whole system.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the bill said it does nothing to address the
problems with the current system.
</P>
<P>
   ''This bill is the one that preserves the system,'' said Rep.
Robert Farr, R-West Hartford. ''If you don't want to change the
system, this is the bill you want.''

   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ''Erin Brockovich'' nosed out the new release
''Romeo Must Die'' to lay claim to the top box office spot for the
second weekend in a row.
</P>
<P>
   The legal drama starring Julia Roberts grossed $18.5 million for
the weekend, compared with just over $18 million for the action
film ''Romeo Must Die.''
</P>

<HEADLINE> Puckett Wins Men's Giant Slalom  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN MOSSMAN, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSON, Wyo. (AP) -- Casey Puckett, refusing to settle for
second place, regrouped after a near crash on his second run to win
the men's giant slalom on Monday in the U.S. Alpine Ski
Championships.
</P>
<P>
   Puckett, 27, of Crested Butte, Colo., had a combined time for
two runs of 2 minutes, 7.40 seconds, just .07 seconds faster than
Erik Schlopy of Park City, Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Daron Rahlves of Truckee, Calif., was third in 2:07.74.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first career race victory at the nationals for
Puckett, who matched the feat of his older brother, Chris, who
posted his first nationals race win in Friday's downhill. Casey won
the national combined title in 1995, and Chris won the combined
three times, but neither had won a race until this year's event.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Puckett finished fourth in 2:08.04, and Jakub Fiala of
Breckenridge, Colo., was fifth in 2:08.54.
</P>
<P>
   Casey Puckett paced the first run in 1:00.78, which was .18
seconds quicker than Rahlves' 1:00.96. Andrew Martin of Warner,
N.H., stood third, .43 seconds off the lead, and Schlopy was
fourth, .57 seconds out.
</P>
<P>
   Warm temperatures created soft snow for the second run, but the
course held up well for the top 30 skiers who raced in reverse
order in the second run.
</P>
<P>
   Schlopy had the fastest time in the second run of 1:06.12 for an
aggregate time of 2:07.47 that momentarily took the lead. Martin
and Rahlves couldn't dislodge him from the top spot, but Casey
Puckett came across in 1:06.62 -- the third-fastest clocking of the
second heat despite nearly losing control.
</P>
<P>
   ''About halfway down, I went over the Pro Bump and got out of
balance,'' he said. ''I felt like I was upside down. I was in the
strangest position. One of my skis was up in the air. But I had to
keep going. I just barely pulled it out, but that's enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Puckett approached this year's nationals with a goal of winning
and ending his frustrating string of second-place finishes.
</P>
<P>
   ''As many second places as I've had -- I don't know how many -- I
started to think I was never going to win,'' he said. ''I was
always right there, top three, a contender. But I never was able to
get first place. Now I've got it and I'm happy.
</P>
<P>
   ''My mindset coming in here was: I want to win, I don't want
second place.''
</P>
<P>
   Puckett, the 1991 world junior slalom champion who finished
seventh in the slalom in the 1994 Olympics and 12th in a World Cup
giant slalom a year ago, now sets his sights on Wednesday's slalom
-- the concluding event.
</P>
<P>
   Puckett finished eighth in the downhill and second in the
super-G, giving him the inside track on another combined title.
</P>
<P>
   Schlopy, 27, said his half-second deficit after the first run
was too much to overcome.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that's where I lost the race, in the first run,''
Schlopy said. ''In the last couple of gates, I stuck my head in a
panel. I could have gone out easily, but I hung tough. It's better
to get second than go out, so I'm happy.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the second run, I made up a lot of time on the bottom half
of the course. But I didn't think it would be good enough to win.
Five-tenths is a lot to make up on this course.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it was close.
</P>
<P>
   ''Seven-hundredths,'' Schlopy said. ''I mean, that's half an
arm's length.''
</P>
<P>
   The women's giant slalom is scheduled for Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Alford Denies Knight Punch Report  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   In the latest accusation against Bob Knight, a former
Indiana
player claims the coach once punched star guard Steve Alford.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Alford, however, said the comments by former Hoosiers teammate
Ricky Calloway are incorrect.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nothing along those lines ever happened,'' Alford, now the
head basketball coach at Iowa, said Sunday in a statement issued by
the school's sports information office.
</P>
<P>
   Calloway told the Houston Chronicle he saw Knight punch Alford
and slap forward Daryl Thomas during practices.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were all standing in a circle one day, and he (Knight) just
turned around and punched Steve right in the stomach, and for a
minute and a half Steve couldn't breathe,'' Calloway said in
Sunday's Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was shocked. I wasn't really surprised he hit someone, but I
never expected him to hit Steve, his golden child. But Steve put up
with a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Calloway also told the Chronicle that Knight doesn't abuse all
of his players when he gets angry, only those he knows won't fight
back. He said Thomas was one of those players.
</P>
<P>
   ''Coach knew the guys he could hit or really get into, and those
he couldn't. Daryl was a big guy (6-foot-7, 240 pounds), but coach
knew what type of personality Daryl had. He (Knight) was mad at
him, and Daryl was sitting in his chair, and he (Knight) just came
up and slapped him, and it was hard. Then he realized what he did
and said, 'Go ahead and hit me back.'
</P>
<P>
   ''Yeah, he realized what he did was all wrong, so he knew he had
to try and correct it by telling Daryl to hit him back. But Daryl
hit him real soft, and I remember when we got back to the dorm room
we were like, 'Man, you should have hit him hard.'''
</P>
<P>
   Calloway started as a sophomore on Indiana's 1987 national title
team and transferred to Kansas for his senior year.
</P>
<P>
   He played a season in the NBA with Sacramento, and now runs a
swimming-pool construction company in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Calloway said he is breaking his 12-year silence on Knight after
seeing how another former Indiana player, Neil Reed, has been
vilified for his recent comments about the issue.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with CNN/Sports Illustrated, Reed claimed Knight
choked him during a practice session, prompting numerous denials
from former Hoosiers players and coaches.
</P>
<P>
   Two Indiana University trustees agreed last week to investigate
Reed's claims against Knight.
</P>
<P>
   Other than saying he didn't remember choking Reed, Knight has
refused comment on the incident.
</P>
<P>
   Attempts by The Indianapolis Star to reach athletic director
Clarence Doninger on Sunday were unsuccessful; Knight was at a
baseball exhibition game Sunday in Winter Haven, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   In the Houston article, Calloway praised Reed for speaking out.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody says he's lying about all the abuse at Indiana, but
he's not,'' Calloway said about Reed. ''It took a lot of courage
for him to come forward like he did.''

<HEADLINE> Senate OKs Bill Limiting Seizures  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate passed legislation Monday that puts
new curbs on the federal government's ability to seize private
property suspected of being linked to crime.
</P>
<P>
   The voice vote in the Senate sends the asset forfeiture bill to
the House where it has the backing of House Judiciary Committee
Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill.
</P>
<P>
   The aim of the legislation is to alter a crime-fighting practice
that has resulted in the seizure of hundreds of millions of dollars
in property, mainly from suspected drug traffickers, but has also
led to cases where innocent people are deprived of their homes,
cars and boats.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, said Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., will ''protect the
legitimate constitutional rights of American citizens while at the
same time protecting this tremendous asset to law enforcement.''
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would shift the burden of proof in asset
forfeiture cases from the property owner, where it now lies, to the
government.
</P>
<P>
   A House version of the bill that passed last June by 375-48
stated that the government must have ''clear and convincing
evidence'' that property is being used in an illegal act.
</P>
<P>
   But the administration said that set too high a bar for federal
prosecutors, and some senators agreed. House and Senate lawmakers
met last week with Attorney General Janet Reno to work out a
compromise that now states the government must make its case ''by a
preponderance of the evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill also enables a judge to release property to the owner
if continued government possession poses a substantial hardship,
extends the time a property owner has to challenge a seizure in
court and ends the requirement that a person seeking to recover
property post a bond with the court.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, ranking Democrat on the Senate
Judiciary Committee, said asset forfeiture has been a
''particularly potent weapon in the war on drugs.'' But abuses have
occurred, he said, when ''prosecutorial zeal skirts the boundaries
of due process, leading to the taking of private property
regardless of whether the owner is innocent of, or even cognizant
of, the property's use in an illegal act.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill is supported by a broad range of groups, including the
U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the American Civil Liberties Union, the
RNA, and the American Bar Association.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The bill number is H.R. 1658.

<HEADLINE> Babbitt Unveils Yosemite Plans  </HEADLINE>
By CHRISTINE HANLEY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt on Monday
previewed a long-awaited development plan for Yosemite Valley that
seeks to restore and protect the park's splendor by significantly
scaling back parking and protecting the Merced River.
</P>
<P>
   The ambitious proposal, outlined in a 500-page draft summary
called the Yosemite Valley Plan, would include moving the park
superintendent's home, staff headquarters, housekeeping,
concessioners and entire campgrounds out of seven-mile long,
one-mile wide Yosemite Valley, the main destination for park
visitors.
</P>
<P>
   The plan also calls for converting a portion of a popular road
through the village into a bike and foot trail and studying for
five years how the valley's natural habitats are effected by
current crowds, and imposing an 150-foot wide development
protection zone along most of the Merced River.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not about turning people away from the park,'' Babbitt
said. ''The problem is not that there's too many people. The
problem is there's too many cars.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan, if approved by the National Park Service, would end a
20-year effort to reduce the human footprint in the valley -- a
exhaustive campaign that has been marked by political, legal and
emotional battles. But the process is far from over, and Babbitt
encouraged people to make their voices heard during the 90-day
comment period that begins April 7.
</P>
<P>
   ''Public opinion counts. You have the chance to vote thumbs
down,'' Babbitt told a few hundred people during a luncheon
organized by the Commonwealth Club, a civic group. ''Do not lapse
into a silent majority.''
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the Yosemite plan is a shuttle bus system that
would ferry day visitors in from three expanded lots at the main
entrances to the park, which draws nearly 4 million visitors a year
and 7,000 cars on a busy summer day. Babbitt estimated the flow of
traffic would be reduced by 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists voiced early support for the plan, agreeing
that it balances ecological needs with those of the public.
</P>
<P>
   ''I really think the plan finds an elegant balance between park
protection and visitor use and enjoyment,'' said Jay Watson,
regional director for The Wilderness Society, who played a lead
role in the proposal. ''The Park Service should be applauded for
listening to the public in putting this thing together.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Sierra Club took issue with the timing of the release of
the draft report, noting how the Merced River Plan has yet to be
finalized, and must be before Yosemite's general plan is carried
out.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Merced River forms the heart of the valley ... There isn't
a way to evaluate the Yosemite Plan until the river plan is done,''
said Sierra Club spokeswoman Joyce Eden.
</P>
<P>
   The Yosemite draft reflects a broader, stepped-up and somewhat
controversial mission by federal land managers to protect wildlife
and habitats in public lands -- sometimes at the expense restricting
visitors or excluding snowmobiles, jet skis, tour planes and other
recreational vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   ''They do pollute the environment and just the use of them is
skyrocketing,'' said Elaine Sevy, a chief spokeswoman for the
National Park Service.
</P>
<P>
   Some recreationalists fear this trend will inevitably lead to
tighter restrictions down the road.
</P>
<P>
   Already, a national rule scheduled to go into effect April 20
will limit the use of jet skis to 21 of 379 parks. Congress passed
legislation last week that will restrict the amount of scenic air
tours above parks, said Destry Jarvis, an assistant with the
Interior Department. Many parks already have or are considering
their own specific recreational rules. For example, the Grand
Canyon already governs its air traffic and Yellowstone is
considering banning snowmobiles.
</P>
<P>
   ''I guess the question we're asking is, 'Is the government
protecting the land for the people or from the people?'' said Tom
Barile, chairman of the Sierra Nevada Access, Multiple-Use and
Stewardship Coalition, a group of property owners, businesses,
off-road vehicle enthusiasts, horseback riders, loggers and
campers. ''People need to recreate.''

<HEADLINE> Whitman wants constitutional amendment to help identify sexoffenders  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- The state's constitution must be changed to
allow ready access to information about sex offenders on the
Internet ''to ensure the safety of our community,'' Gov. Christie
Whitman said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey would join more than a dozen other states where
details about sex offenders -- including name, address and criminal
record -- are just a point and click away.
</P>
<P>
   Without a constitutional amendment, any legislative action, like
a vote Monday by the Assembly to create an Internet registry of sex
offenders, would be rejected by the courts, Whitman said. Judges
have ruled that information about sex offenders is generally
private and community notifications allowed by the law must be
strictly limited and controlled.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman said there is a growing public demand for such
information and with the advent of the Internet, the state must
''take the next step'' to get those details into the community.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have always been sensitive to the privacy issue of the
court. But we're more sensitive to the privacy issue of the
community,'' Whitman said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whether you are hiring a new baby-sitter, Little League coach
or camp counselor, you will be able to use the Internet to confirm
that the person is not a convicted sex offender,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   If approved by the Legislature and then by voters, Whitman said
the amendment would give the public ''the maximum amount of
information to ensure the safety of the community.''
</P>
<P>
   The state's Megan's Law categorizes convicted sex offenders into
three levels, based on the perceived risk they present of
committing another sex crime.
</P>
<P>
   For those considered to pose a minimal risk, the amendment would
let the public submit a person's name and one other piece of
information, such as his home address, to see the Internet registry
about him.
</P>
<P>
   For those considered at moderate or high risk of re-offending,
the public simply would have to access the Internet registry. The
registry would contain the offender's name and aliases, any Megan's
Law offenses committed, his age, race, date of birth, height,
weight, hair and eye color, address and a photograph.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have pretty full disclosure now. This is making it easier
for people to access that information,'' Whitman told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, for those considered at least risk, prosecutors tell
police departments that the offender is living in the community.
For those perceived to be at moderate or high risk of reoffending,
the law allows prosecutors to provide an offender's name, address
and photo to residents, schools and day care centers in a carefully
defined area.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're talking about taking it another step,'' the governor
said, calling the amendment ''open enough'' to use the Internet and
any other new communication methods. It would be up to the
Legislature to decide the exact details of how the registry would
work.
</P>
<P>
   The Assembly voted 55 to 0, with 16 members abstaining, to pass
a bill sponsored by Assemblyman Joel Weingarten, R-Essex, to create
an Internet registry of sex offenders.
</P>
<P>
   The governor gave her amendment to both houses of the
Legislature and she also submitted legislation directing the
superintendent of the State Police to prepare the Internet
registry.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman said she was confident that the legislation would be
acceptable to federal courts.
</P>
<P>
   ''Other states have been doing this and not run into a
problem,'' the governor said.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest court challenge, a federal judge said in December
that authorities routinely allowed private information about sex
offenders to become public during community notifications. The
judge ordered the state to revise its regulations or have the
system shut down.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Attorney General John J. Farmer, Jr. released new
guidelines requiring people who receive notices to sign papers
promising to keep the information secret.
</P>
<P>
   Any amendment must win 27 votes in the Senate and 48 in the
Assembly. Then it must win voter approval in a statewide
referendum. Whitman said the measure would have to pass both houses
by August in order to be on the ballot in November's general
election.
</P>
<P>
   Both Senate President Donald T. DiFrancesco, R-Union, and
Assembly Speaker Jack Collins, R-Salem, said the amendment would
likely win legislative approval.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is for the protection of our children. Certainly people
are calling for additional protection as technology changes,''
DiFrancesco said.
</P>
<P>
   Megan's Law is named for Megan Kanka, a 7-year-old Hamilton
Township girl who was raped and murdered in July 1994 by a
convicted sex offender who lived across the street from her Mercer
County home.
</P>
<P>
   Farmer said at least 15 other states have established publicly
accessible sex offender registries on the Internet, and there are
at least another 80 regional sex offender Internet sites
established by local or regional law enforcement agencies.

<HEADLINE> DeBartolo: Edwards Wanted Money  </HEADLINE>
By NATALIE GOTT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) -- Former San Francisco 49ers owner Eddie
DeBartolo Jr. testified Monday that ex-Gov. Edwin Edwards demanded
and received $400,000 from him to ensure that his application for a
riverboat casino license would be approved.
</P>
<P>
   A day after DeBartolo allegedly gave the former four-term
governor the money -- in stacks of $100 bills in a briefcase at the
San Francisco airport -- the Louisiana gambling board unanimously
awarded a license to DeBartolo.
</P>
<P>
   DeBartolo also testified that the former governor called him
after agents raided Edwards' home in 1997. He said Edwards told
him: ''They're everywhere and they're going through everything. The
FBI is everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   DeBartolo's testimony has been the most anticipated in Edwards'
federal racketeering trial, not only because he is one of the
richest men in the country and a former NFL team owner, but also
because he is the only witness who claims Edwards himself extorted
money and collected it. Other witnesses have testified that Edwards
had his friends and son demand money from them.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors say Edwards and his son Stephen, along with
a state senator and four other men, manipulated the licensing of
riverboat casinos before and after the governor left office in
1996. The ex-governor could face 350 years in prison and $7.2
million in fines if convicted. Stephen could get 305 years.
</P>
<P>
   DeBartolo pleaded guilty to failing to report a felony in the
case, agreed to pay up to $1 million in fines and was placed on two
years' probation. He has given up his casino license and was forced
to turn control of the 49ers over to his sister.
</P>
<P>
   He testified in a packed courtroom Monday that he paid Edwards
for help getting state approval for a casino license in the
Shreveport-Bossier City area.
</P>
<P>
   DeBartolo said Edwards told him -- without ever saying the words
-- how much money he would need during a meeting at a bar at a Baton
Rouge hotel, one night before the gambling board's final hearing
for riverboat applicants.
</P>
<P>
   DeBartolo said the former governor slipped him a piece of paper
with ''$400,000'' written on it, and told him, ''This has to be
taken care of by next week or there's going to be a serious problem
with your license.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Did you think you had any choice but to pay Edwin Edwards?''
prosecutor Mike Magner asked.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had no choice,'' DeBartolo responded.
</P>
<P>
   During the same meeting, DeBartolo said, Edwards also said that
he wanted a 1 percent interest in the casino.
</P>
<P>
   One week later, DeBartolo said, he put a briefcase filled with
$100 bills in the trunk of his car and picked up Edwards at the San
Francisco airport and drove to a diner five minutes away.
</P>
<P>
   DeBartolo said he asked Edwards: ''How do you plan on moving
this money through the airport? It's in a briefcase and it's got to
go through X-ray machines. That's a red flag and they're going to
know that something's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He said: 'That's not going to be a problem,''' DeBartolo said.
''He opened up his shirt and showed me a belt chest-high. ...
That's where he intended to put the money.''
</P>
<P>
   After the lunch, DeBartolo said, he took Edwards to the airport,
where the former governor took the briefcase and went inside.
</P>
<P>
   ''The next morning, he called me and told me that the board had
voted and we won the approval six to nothing,'' DeBartolo said.
</P>
<P>
   DeBartolo said that even though Edwards had been out of office
for a year, he remained powerful because he had made many
appointments and ''basically could do anything he wanted to get
done.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney Daniel Small tried to raise doubts about
DeBartolo's credibility.
</P>
<P>
   Small asserted that DeBartolo's plea agreement -- which included
agreeing to testify against Edwards -- was a self-serving attempt to
regain control of his football team. He noted that DeBartolo's
attorney sent NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue a document repeatedly
referring to DeBartolo as a victim of extortion who pleaded guilty
to a ''highly technical'' crime.
</P>
<P>
   DeBartolo insisted that getting his team back was not his
motivation. ''I entered into a plea because I did something
wrong,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards' attorneys have long said that the payments from
DeBartolo were for legitimate consulting work and advice.
</P>
<P>
   In court, Small played several secretly taped conversations
between Edwards and DeBartolo in which DeBartolo is heard probing
Edwards on his knowledge of the gambling board and legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you had questions about the process, you called Edwin
Edwards?'' Small said.
</P>
<P>
   DeBartolo said Edwards never sent him a bill for relaying
advice.
</P>
<P>
   Small asserted that DeBartolo paid Edwards in cash because
DeBartolo did not want his partners to know about their
relationship. DeBartolo's partners had told him Edwards could hurt
their chances of getting a license.
</P>
<P>
   DeBartolo's relationship with Edwards grew out of the friendship
between Edwards and DeBartolo's father, who built the Louisiana
Downs race track in Shreveport and a shopping mall in New Orleans
in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   DeBartolo Sr. paid Edwards $155,000 to do legal work at
Louisiana Downs while Edwards was between terms in the early 1980s
and 1990s, DeBartolo acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   When asked under cross-examination whether his father paid
Edwards the money for legitimate purposes, DeBartolo said: ''I am
not about to speculate on what he did with the governor.''
</P>
<P>
   By his own count, Edwards, 72, has been the subject of almost
two dozen state or federal investigations going back to his days as
a congressman in the 1960s. In 1986, he was acquitted on federal
racketeering charges involving health care investments.

<HEADLINE> Settlement in NYC Museum Flap  </HEADLINE>
By TOM HAYS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The city halted its attack on a Brooklyn museum
on Monday, signing a settlement barring Mayor Rudolph Giuliani from
withholding funds in retaliation for showing a British exhibit
featuring a dung-decorated painting of the Virgin Mary.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement with the Brooklyn Museum of Art came six months
after Giuliani -- calling the painting ''sick'' -- froze an annual
$7.2 million operating subsidy for the museum, then sued in state
court to evict it from the city-owned site it's held for a century.
</P>
<P>
   After the museum filed its own lawsuit in federal court, U.S.
District Judge Nina Gershon declared the sanctions unconstitutional
late last year in a preliminary order restoring funding. The mayor
refused to back down, renouncing Gershon as ''totally out of
control'' and appealing her decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today, Mayor Giuliani has agreed that the preliminary
injunction that he ridiculed a few months ago will become
permanent,'' museum attorney Floyd Abrams said.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement requires both sides to drop their lawsuits and
appeals over the ''Sensation'' exhibit and pay their own legal
fees. It also commits the city to spend $5.8 million over two years
for a museum renovation project.
</P>
<P>
   In signing off on the settlement, Gershon specifically barred
Giuliani and the city from retaliating against or punishing the
museum.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani was meeting with Republican leaders in Albany and had
no immediate response. However attorney Michael Hess said the
administration was ''very gratified with the settlement ... We felt
at this time that it was time to end the hostilities on both
sides.''

   Cota and Newby face assault charges in District Court stemming
from a Halloween night brawl. Their trial has been delayed three

<HEADLINE> Indians Involved in Rocker Rumors  </HEADLINE>
By TOM WITHERS, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MELBOURNE, Fla. (AP) -- Cleveland manager Charlie Manuel escaped
the strong winds blowing inside Space Coast Stadium on Monday by
stepping down into the Indians' dugout.
</P>
<P>
   Once inside, he asked about the big trade rumor that blew
through earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ''We got Rocker yet?'' Manuel joked following Monday's 8-2 win
over the Florida Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   John Rocker, Atlanta's controversial pitcher who was suspended
by baseball for insensitive racial comments, is reportedly being
discussed as part of a trade between the Braves and Indians, who
just might be in the market for a closer.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think probably everyone in baseball has asked about
Rocker,'' Manuel said. ''I know his name came up, but how involved
and deep we got, I don't know. I don't think that it's gotten to
where we were dickering over a deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocker's name has been popping up all over Florida. Baseball
fans are still arguing over whether he's a hero or martyr, while
major league general managers are trying to decide if the
left-hander would fit in with their teams.
</P>
<P>
   Or if he's worth the trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Indians GM John Hart is one of them.
</P>
<P>
   Hart wouldn't confirm or deny a report in Monday's (Cleveland)
Plain Dealer that he's discussed a trade involving Rocker and
left-hander Bruce Chen for starter Jaret Wright, reliever Paul
Shuey and infielders John McDonald or Jolbert Cabrera.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the time for a lot of rumors,'' Hart said while
sitting behind home plate during Monday's game. ''And right now
I've got two guys competing for a closer's job, so I really don't
want to say anything about that.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody realizes the Rocker situation, which I guess you
could say was a winter of turmoil.''
</P>
<P>
   The same could be said of the Indians' current relief pitching
situation.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's unsettled,'' Hart said.
</P>
<P>
   When Mike Jackson, who saved 39 games for Cleveland last year,
wasn't re-signed this winter, the Indians were left without a
closer. Manuel's plan was to have a competition for the job between
Steve Karsay and Paul Shuey, but so far that battle has been very
one-sided.
</P>
<P>
   Karsay, a former starter who has never closed before in his
career, has not allowed a run in 8 1-3 innings during the
exhibition season.
</P>
<P>
   Shuey, meanwhile, had his ERA swell to 10.80 after giving up six
runs and six hits in two-thirds of an inning against the St. Louis
Cardinals on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the disparity in numbers, Manuel isn't ready to pick
a closer.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't want either one to think I'm putting the other one
ahead of him now,'' Manuel said. ''If someone steps up fine, but
right now nobody is ahead of the other.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocker would immediately step ahead of both Karsay and Shuey. He
had 38 saves and a 2.49 ERA last season, but is suspended for the
first two weeks of the season for his disparaging comments about
minorities, gays and foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's not too many guys out there with Rocker's ability,''
said Manuel. ''He'll light you up.''
</P>
<P>
   Manuel said he wouldn't be too concerned about how his team
might react if Rocker were to join the Indians, who like the Braves
have a large nucleus of Latin players.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would say the majority of them would give him another
chance,'' Manuel said. ''We can give forgive the president of the
U.S., we can forgive Rocker if he throws 100 (mph).''
</P>
<P>
   There are other reason to think the Indians and Braves could be
up to something.
</P>
<P>
   Hart is good friends with Atlanta GM John Schuerholz, who denied
a trade Monday that had Rocker going to Montreal for closer Ugueth
Urbina. The two pulled off a blockbuster trade on the eve of
opening day in 1997 when Hart traded Kenny Lofton and Alan Embree
to Atlanta for Marquis Grissom and David Justice.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker got a mixed greeting from Indians fans when he pitched in
Winter Haven last week, and he could be back there again Tuesday
when Cleveland plays host to Atlanta.

<HEADLINE> Juror Excused in Reggie Lewis Case  </HEADLINE>
By JIMMY GOLEN, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- A doctor being sued in the Reggie Lewis case
sought Monday to dismiss the lawsuit because a magazine article
tainted a prospective juror's views.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Thayer Fremont-Smith denied the request, but did excuse
the prospective juror, who said she had seen news reports in which
the former Boston Celtics star's widow compared herself to the
widows of six firefighters who died in a warehouse fire.
</P>
<P>
   ''You know, I think about those firefighters in Worcester. Lots
of money is being raised for those families, and I need to be taken
care of, too,'' Donna Harris-Lewis told Boston Magazine for its
April issue. ''Everybody has to say I'm greedy. But I do want my
money back this time around. Why should I lose?''
</P>
<P>
   Jury selection began Monday for the second malpractice trial of
Dr. Gilbert Mudge, whose first trial ended in a deadlocked jury.
Opening arguments are scheduled to begin April 3, and the trial is
expected to last four to five weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors were asked the standard questions about whether they had
any relationship with the plaintiffs, defendants or their lawyers.
But they were also asked whether they would not be able to render
an impartial decision because of loyalty to the NBA team; only
three raised their hands.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis collapsed in April 1993 during a Celtics playoff game, and
doctors initially diagnosed the problem as a potentially fatal
heart arrhythmia. But Lewis and his wife were unhappy with the
diagnosis and transferred hospitals, hiring a ''Dream Team,''
including Mudge, who said the player suffered from a benign
fainting disorder.
</P>
<P>
   Mudge publicly pronounced in May 1993 that Lewis could play
basketball ''without limitation.'' On July 27, 1993, Lewis
collapsed at the Celtics' practice facility and died.
</P>
<P>
   Harris-Lewis sued four doctors for malpractice. John D.
Rutherford, of the University of Houston, settled the lawsuit out
of court in April 1999 for a reported $500,000; two other doctors,
Mark A. Creager and Peter L. Friedman, were exonerated last year
after a seven-week trial.
</P>
<P>
   But the same jury deadlocked on the claims against Mudge, who
claimed that Lewis admitted shortly before his death that he had
used cocaine. The lawyers said the revelations explained why an
accurate diagnosis of Lewis' condition was impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Harris-Lewis denied the drug use.

<HEADLINE> Expos, Braves Nix Rocker Rumors  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KISSIMMEE, Fla. (AP) -- The Atlanta Braves and Expos say they
aren't working on a deal that would send John Rocker to Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   The Record of Hackensack, citing a highly placed baseball
official, said the trade was close to complete.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not true,'' Expos owner Jeffrey Loria said in Monday's
Montreal Gazette. ''I've heard for weeks now about Urbina, Rocker,
a combination. There's nothing on the table.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta general manager John Schuerholz also discounted the
trade rumor.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's an old story. It's not even part of our camp,' he said.
''We're just concerned with how John is pitching.''
</P>
<P>
   In Jupiter, Expos players said they'd be better off without
Rocker.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't have anything against him,'' shortstop Orlando Cabrera
said. ''It's just that with what he did, there's been so much stuff
that it would be a distraction for the team. We're a family right
now and we're focused on winning. We don't need that distraction
right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Urbina led the National League with 41 saves last year.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm really excited about the start of the season,'' Urbina
said. ''With Graeme Lloyd here now, I think we're going to get
better and better. Last year, we lost something like 15 games in
the seventh and eighth innings. Now we have Lloyd to do that work,
and it will help me a lot. We have a pretty good team and we're
going to compete, so I think we're going to surprise a lot of
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocker, who had 38 saves and a 2.49 ERA last season, is
suspended for the first two weeks of the season for his disparaging
comments about minorities, gays and foreigners.

<HEADLINE> Rockies' Cirillo Sidelined  </HEADLINE>
By AARON J. LOPEZ, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- A busy day in the minors may keep Colorado
Rockies third baseman Jeff Cirillo out of the majors on opening
day.
</P>
<P>
   Cirillo, expected to replace Dante Bichette as Colorado's
cleanup hitter, aggravated a strained right quadriceps Monday while
hitting eight times in a minor league game.
</P>
<P>
   ''The leg's not ready,'' Cirillo said. ''There's no pain, but
there's definitely something in there. I almost regret doing this
today. ... I do regret doing it. After my first at-bat, I was like,
'This is probably not a smart idea.' That's where I'm stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   The setback puts Cirillo's status in question for next Monday's
opener against Atlanta. He has missed three straight spring games
and will be out until at least Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Am I concerned about opening day? No. I'm concerned about
getting better in the next three days,'' he said. ''I do all this
other stuff -- exercises and strength work -- and feel fine. When we
get out there and start running and it's quick, it's not there.''
</P>
<P>
   Cirillo's absence hurts Colorado in the field and at the plate.
</P>
<P>
   A steady third baseman, Cirillo hit .326 with 15 home runs and
88 RBIs -- all career bests -- for Milwaukee last year. He was
acquired along with left-handers Scott Karl and Mike Myers in a
nine-player trade in December.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would be a big loss,'' Rockies first baseman Todd Helton
said.
</P>
<P>
   Utility infielders Terry Shumpert and Aaron Ledesma will fill in
at third for now, but manager Buddy Bell still has to figure out
who will protect No. 3 hitter Larry Walker in the batting order.
</P>
<P>
   When asked what would happen if Cirillo is not ready by next
week, Bell said, ''I don't even want to think about that. We're not
considering that at this point. If we get closer, we'll just go
with our extra guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Already without Cirillo, the Rockies got another scare Monday
when second baseman Mike Lansing fouled a ball off his left ankle.
Lansing hobbled off the field but does not expect to miss much
playing time.
</P>
<P>
   ''It didn't swell up too bad,'' Lansing said. ''It's just sore.
Nothing to be alarmed about.''
</P>
<P>
   Shumpert, who is hitting .333 while playing four different
positions this spring, replaced Lansing and homered in the sixth
inning of Colorado's 6-2 victory over the Anaheim Angels.
</P>
<P>
   Ledesma had a tougher time, twice striking out with one out and
a runner at third.

<HEADLINE> NBA Unfair Labor Charge Filed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Claiming the NBA's use of locker room cameras is
an illegal change in working conditions, the league's players filed
an unfair labor practice charge with the National Labor Relations
Board.
</P>
<P>
   The union also wants to stop the NBA from using boom microphones
in team huddles during timeouts.
</P>
<P>
   ''The NBA cannot impose these changes without the union's
consent,'' union lawyer Robert Lanza said Monday. ''While players
certainly want to enhance the game experience for every fan, these
types of changes can only be brought about through collective
bargaining. We must have a meaningful dialogue in order to strike
the appropriate balance between access and intrusion.''
</P>
<P>
   The charge was filed March 16 with the New York regional office
of the NLRB. Dan Silverman, the NLRB's New York regional director,
assigns staff investigators to cases and they usually take 6-8
weeks to determine whether to issue a complaint.
</P>
<P>
   ''The charge is without merit,'' NBA deputy commissioner Russ
Granik said.
</P>
<P>
   NBA coaches earlier complained about the league's attempt to put
mikes on them during some national broadcasts. The boom mikes
during huddles were part of a compromise with the coaches.

<HEADLINE> Gore Offering Fund-Raising Reforms  </HEADLINE>
By SANDRA SOBIERAJ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- When Vice President Al Gore dished up
new-and-improved versions of stale campaign finance reforms on
Monday, he pledged to fight to see them enacted, beseeching
Americans: ''You have to take my word for this.''
</P>
<P>
	   Reform activists said his word was not good enough.
</P>
<P>
	   ''He faces a serious credibility problem about how much he's
committed to this, how much political capital he's willing to spend
on it,'' said Scott Harshbarger, president of Common Cause, which
lobbies for changes in the campaign finance system.
</P>
<P>
	   Harshbarger said Gore has to prove he can do better than Bill
Clinton, who campaigned in 1992 on the issue, ''said all the right
things about giving it priority and did nothing -- except create the
1996 fund-raising scandals.''
</P>
<P>
	   On stage at Marquette University in Milwaukee, Gore proposed
creating a $7.1 billion endowment to pay for House and Senate
campaigns, new disclosure rules for lobbyists and outside groups
that pay for political ads and mandatory free ''rebuttal'' time for
candidates targeted by such third-party ads.
</P>
<P>
	   He acknowledged he was an ''imperfect messenger'' and invoked
purer reformers -- Republican Sen. John McCain, Minnesota Gov. Jesse
Ventura and former Democratic presidential candidate Bill Bradley --
in promising to lead a bipartisan charge for change.
</P>
<P>
	   ''Although you have to take my word for this next point, I
promise you,'' Gore said, campaigning with Wisconsin Sen. Russell
Feingold, sponsor with McCain of the premier campaign finance
reform bill languishing in Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   '' ... Don't doubt for a minute, we can do it, we can do it. We
WILL do it,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
	   Larry Makinson, executive director of the Center for Responsive
Politics, which tracks political money, saw Gore's latest
initiative as ''a big attempt to get the monkey off his back''
before Republican rival George W. Bush inflicts irreparable damage
on the issue.
</P>
<P>
	   Even before Gore spoke Monday, Bush circulated a written
statement pressing Gore anew to release details of his 1996
''mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
	   Without full disclosure of the vice president's fund-raising
phone calls from the White House and cash reception at a Buddhist
temple, ''any promise to reform our campaign finance system will
ring hollow,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore's speech, which he carefully read from a prepared text,
sounded empty to Matt Binsfeld, a 22-year-old engineering senior at
Marquette. ''I think he thinks he can pick up a lot of votes this
way.''
</P>
<P>
	   And although Don Bina, a 68-year-old beef and hog farmer from
Coon Valley, found Gore credible enough on campaign finance reform
-- because, ''Nobody can be perfect all the time,'' he said -- some
political opportunism rang through for him, too.
</P>
<P>
	   ''As the campaign progresses, (Gore and Bush) are out to win the
election and they're going to use whatever they have to do that,''
Bina said.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, whose battle cry against the corrupting influence of
money in politics nearly toppled Bush in the GOP primaries, piled
on with a statement from his Senate office.
</P>
<P>
	   ''While parts of his proposal merit serious consideration, to
convince a skeptical public that his efforts are sincere and not an
election-year conversion, the vice president needs to back his
words with meaningful, bipartisan action as well as call for a
complete and open investigation of 1996 campaign finance
irregularities,'' McCain said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   Elaine Kamarck, policy adviser to the Gore campaign, said Gore
recognized that taxpayer financing of federal elections, the object
of one of his first bills as a freshman congressman from Tennessee
in 1978, has long been a dead-end issue.
</P>
<P>
	   So, said Kamarck, Gore ''carefully crafted the 'Democracy
Endowment' to try to deal with the political impasse.''
</P>
<P>
	   The fund, envisioned as a $7.1 billion pot whose interest income
would finance congressional races, would operate like a university
endowment, collecting corporate and foundation money in exchange
for a 100 percent tax deduction.
</P>
<P>
	   Harshbarger cheered the proposal for meeting ''a lot of the
objections that have been posed to public financing.'' And Makinson
said, Gore ''deserves points for coming up with an idea no one ever
thought of before on an issue that's pretty old.''
</P>
<P>
	   But Makinson doubted that businesses would hand over endowment
contributions ''without a very specific IOU.''
</P>
<P>
	   And the reliance of Gore's plan on free TV air time as a
condition for broadcast licenses is naive, both experts agreed.
</P>
<P>
	   ''I started off this morning thinking this was a great idea but
by this afternoon I'm beginning to find holes in it. Broadcasters
are not going to embrace this with open arms,'' said Makinson.
</P>
<P>
	   ''TV broadcasters have been the most powerful special interest
in defeating even (free air time), which you might think would be
the easiest of campaign reforms,'' Harshbarger said.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore's earlier campaign proposal to reject ''soft money''
spending and replace presidential campaign TV ads with twice weekly
issue debates has been well received by the public, according to a
CBS News poll released Monday. More than six in 10 Americans said
they approved of the idea.
</P>
<P>
	   In the poll, conducted before Gore announced his newest
proposals, people were equally divided on whether the vice
president really wants to change campaign laws or keep them as they
are now.

<HEADLINE> US: Elian's Relatives Not Complying  </HEADLINE>
By MILDRADE CHERFILS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- The Justice Department threatened to take Elian
Gonzalez from his Miami relatives Monday, as a crowd gathered
outside the boy's Little Havana home, ready to form a human chain
if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   The risk of a confrontation over the 6-year-old boy appeared to
grow as the government and the Miami relatives traded accusations.
The relatives were so worried that Elian would be taken away that
they kept him home from school.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno has demanded that the Miami
relatives pursue any court appeals rapidly and promise to surrender
Elian for return to his father in Cuba if they lose.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the relatives filed their latest appeal -- and asked
that the case get expedited handling -- but they have not addressed
the other demand.
</P>
<P>
   ''That being so, the INS is under no obligation to maintain the
current arrangement,'' the government wrote in response, referring
to the deal giving Elian's great-uncle custody in the meantime.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department spokeswoman Carole Florman would not say what
the government would do next. She said the department would send
the family a letter outlining its plans.
</P>
<P>
   The agency has made it clear would not want to do anything to
traumatize the boy or provoke Miami's large Cuban community.
</P>
<P>
   About 100 people held a candlelight vigil outside his Little
Havana home Monday evening. Earlier a small group spilled into the
streets waving a large Cuban flag but did not block traffic.
Someone put a 15-foot banner in front of the house with a drawing
of Elian and a message: ''I just want to live in freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the protesters responded to a call by the Democracy
Movement, an anti-Castro group, to be prepared to form a human
chain around the home if the government tries to remove the child
and send him back to his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are a lot of people who aren't willing to kill but are
willing to die only for the child's rights,'' said Raul Sanchez,
head of the Democracy Movement.
</P>
<P>
   Olga Scott, 50, arrived from Houston Monday to join the protest.
''Over our dead bodies, they will not take him,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In an apparent effort to increase American support for their
battle to keep Elian, the child's relatives last week allowed ABC's
Diane Sawyer to spend two days with Elian. The result was his first
extended interview. The first of three segments aired Monday on
''Good Morning America.''
</P>
<P>
   In the segment broadcast Monday, Elian was not asked whether he
wants to return to Cuba. But he described how the boat that was
bringing him and his mother from Cuba sank, and he said he doesn't
believe his mother is dead.
</P>
<P>
   Elian drew crayon pictures of the voyage in which his mother and
10 other people drowned. He was found clinging to an inner tube on
Thanksgiving and placed with his relatives in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ''My mother is not in heaven, not lost,'' he said in Spanish
through his cousin Marisleysis Gonzalez. ''She must have been
picked up here in Miami somewhere. She must have lost her memory,
and just doesn't know I'm here.''
</P>
<P>
   Marisleysis Gonzalez gently reminded him that he knows what
really happened to his mother, and he continued gazing downward.
</P>
<P>
   Elian remained home Monday, and family spokesman Armando
Gutierrez said he won't return to school out of fears that Cuba
might try to force him back to the communist island.
</P>
<P>
   As she left the boy's home at the end of the school day, teacher
Obdulia Copa confirmed that she will be teaching the child at home
for the rest of the week and possibly until the custody dispute is
resolved.
</P>
<P>
   The family wants the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in
Atlanta to overturn a federal judge's ruling last week affirming
the Immigration and Naturalization Service's decision to return
Elian to Cuba. The family asked that the case get a speeded-up
handling.
</P>
<P>
   The court responded by asking for the family to file briefs by
April 10 and for the government to respond by April 24.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Osberg-Braun, an attorney for Elian's Miami relatives,
insisted the family has complied with the government's demands.
</P>
<P>
   ''In light of our cooperation, we request that your officials
cease their constant threats to revoke Elian's parole,'' the
attorneys wrote in a letter to Reno.
</P>
<P>
   In a rare move, the family allowed a few reporters inside the
house to show them an image that had appeared in an oval mirror.
Tears flowed down the cheeks of Lazaro Gonzalez, Elian's great
uncle, as he stared at a form he claimed was the Virgin Mary.

<HEADLINE> Malaria Outbreak Hits Ecuador  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- An outbreak of malaria has left about
100,000 people infected in this small Andean nation, health
officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said the vast majority of patients were not at risk
of dying, if they received proper treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are about 100,000 cases of malaria, when normally this
time of year there should be no more than 20,000,'' said Health
Minister Fernando Bustamente.
</P>
<P>
   Officials blamed much of the increase on more breeding sites for
mosquitos that carry the disease. They said recent heavy rains
increased the amount of pooled and stagnant water where the insects
breed.
</P>
<P>
   At least six people have died in Ecuador recently from malaria.
Symptoms usually include fever, chills, joint pain and vomiting.
</P>
<P>
   Health officials have also detected at least 220 infections and
eight deaths from dengue fever, known as break-bone fever because
of the muscle and joint pains it causes.
</P>
<P>
   The Health Ministry declared a medical state of emergency
earlier this month in 17 of Ecuador's 23 provinces, covering most
of its Pacific coast, as well as five jungle regions that border
Peru and Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the malaria cases were reported in the central provinces
of Guayas and Los Rios in low-lying tropical areas, Bustamente
said.
</P>
<P>
   The last Malaria and Dengue fever outbreaks in Ecuador occurred
in 1997 and 1998 during the El Nino weather phenomenon, which
ravaged this nation of 12 million people with heavy flooding.

<HEADLINE> Putin Wins, But 'No Quick Solutions'  </HEADLINE>
By ANGELA CHARLTON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Vladimir Putin, taking the helm of a weak,
unwieldy Russia as its second democratically elected president,
admitted to voters Monday that he has no swift solutions to the
poverty and corruption that bedevil his nation.
</P>
<P>
   Putin ordered the government to pay off wage debts to state
workers, and said a first order of business after his convincing
victory in Sunday's election would be selecting a prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   World leaders cautiously welcomed Putin's victory. President
Clinton called Putin to congratulate him Monday, and used the
opportunity to reiterate U.S. dismay over the war in Chechnya. U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan predicted U.N.-Russian relations would
strengthen under Putin.
</P>
<P>
   Putin has promised to protect democratic freedoms, but has yet
to indicate how he would carry the sprawling nation into the
post-Boris Yeltsin era. Putin, 47, was named acting president when
Yeltsin resigned Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Putin visited Yeltsin at his country house outside Moscow on
Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have taken the correct course. You are doing your job,
fulfilling your duties,'' Yeltsin told his successor after
congratulating him in footage shown on Russian television.
</P>
<P>
   Many Russians hope Putin will distance himself from Yeltsin,
whose unpredictability and poor health -- along with the allegations
of corruption within his inner circle -- contributed to his
political demise.
</P>
<P>
   ''New people are likely to appear'' when Putin names his
government, Dmitry Kozak, the government chief of staff, said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   After he is inaugurated in early May, Putin will appoint a prime
minister, who will then form a government, the Interfax news agency
cited Kozak as saying. As acting president, Putin retained the
position of prime minister, which he has held since Yeltsin
appointed him in August.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's levelheaded, firm-handed approach impressed voters.
Russians like his pledges to restore the country's military might,
fight corruption, and battle poverty and social injustice.
</P>
<P>
   They also admire his uncompromising stance against rebels in
Chechnya -- although ending the war gracefully could prove a major
challenge.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference as election returns were coming in, Putin
acknowledged the enormity of the task facing him and said he could
promise no quick fixes.
</P>
<P>
   ''The level of expectations is very high. People are tired and
struggling and they're hoping for things to get better, but
miracles don't happen,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Putin met with government ministers and ordered wage
debts to state workers to be paid in full by April 1, according to
Deputy Prime Minister Viktor Khristenko. Under Yeltsin, the
cash-starved government often let pensions and wages go unpaid for
months.
</P>
<P>
   With 95.5 percent of the vote counted, Putin led with 52.6
percent. Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov, who put up a
stronger-than-expected election fight, was second with 29.3
percent. Liberal Grigory Yavlinsky was third with 5.8 percent;
eight other candidates lagged far behind.
</P>
<P>
   Putin said his government would have to take into account the
millions who voted against him. He said he would consider bringing
opposition groups into the government if they shared his views.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our policy must be more balanced, take into account the
existing realities and aim at increasing living standards,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Though the vote was only Russia's second democratic presidential
election, international election observers deemed the balloting
free and fair.
</P>
<P>
   Zyuganov, however, accused the government of falsifying the
results, saying the Communist vote was more than 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ''They have set up a zone of blanket fraud to cheat citizens,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's campaign chief, Dmitry Medvedev, dismissed Zyuganov's
claims.
</P>
<P>
   Medvedev also denied that the so-called oligarchs, Russian
moguls who financed Yeltsin's 1996 re-election campaign, played a
role in Putin's victory.
</P>
<P>
   ''The oligarchs will be distanced from power,'' Medvedev told
reporters.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Ties Up Goods Headed for Iraq  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Even as the United States announced it was
allowing $100 million in equipment to go to Iraq through the U.N.
humanitarian program, Washington tied up $7.6 million in new goods,
U.N. figures showed Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The figures also showed that most of the equipment that
Washington released on Friday included cranes, forklift trucks, car
batteries and refrigeration equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has tied up over $1 billion worth of goods in
the U.N. sanctions committee arguing that it wants to make sure it
cannot be used for military purposes.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and nearly every Security
Council ambassador urged Washington to release the contracts at an
open meeting of the Security Council on Friday so the equipment can
repair Iraq's decayed electric, water, sanitation and oil
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy U.S. Ambassador James Cunningham announced at that
meeting that Washington was releasing 70 contracts worth over $100
million and was conducting a review to see if there were ways to
speed up its approval for contracts.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is also sponsoring a resolution to double the
amount of spare parts Iraq can buy through the program that is
expected to be approved this week.
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time, Washington put on hold another seven
contracts worth $7.6 million, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said
Monday, citing figures from the U.N. oil-for-food program.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. humanitarian program allows Iraq to sell its oil to buy
humanitarian goods and equipment to repair its oil sector.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BURNABY, British Columbia (AP) -- Donald Brashear practiced
Monday for the first time since Boston defenseman Marty McSorley's
stick attack left the Vancouver forward with a concussion.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was good to get out there, skate again with the guys,''
Brashear said after skating for about an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Brashear, a 6-foot-2, 225-pound left winger, hasn't played since
McSorley hit him over the head in the closing seconds of a Feb. 21
game.
</P>
<P>
   Canucks coach Marc Crawford said Brashear will join the team for
a three-game road trip that opens Wednesday in Detroit and could
play as early as next week.
</P>
<P>
   ''If it was up to me, I would play the next game, but you have
to give it some time,'' Brashear said. ''I haven't practiced with
any hits or anything. I still have to work that out.''
</P>
<P>
   The NHL suspended McSorley for the rest of the regular season
and playoffs. He also faces criminal charges for assault.
</P>
<P>
   Brashear thinks the punishment wasn't enough.
</P>
<P>
   ''He could be paying a lot more, I think,'' Brashear said.
''When they (the suspensions) really get severe, guys usually learn
their lessons. It can cost you a lot of money to get suspended.''

<HEADLINE> Bush To Outline Education Proposals  </HEADLINE>
By GLEN JOHNSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- New plans for reading and teacher recruitment
and retention are part of an expanded education focus for George W.
Bush this week, aides to the presumed Republican presidential
nominee said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The proposals also are aimed at fleshing out the Texas
governor's pledge to make education his top priority if elected
president, a contrast to Vice President Al Gore's promise to make
campaign finance his centerpiece.
</P>
<P>
   Education is an issue that polls especially well with women, a
traditionally Democratic group that Bush is courting in his race
against Gore, the Democrats' likely nominee.
</P>
<P>
   During a speech Tuesday at the Reston, Va., headquarters of
Sallie Mae, the nation's largest issuer of student loans, Bush
planned to outline a new reading program and how he would pay for
it.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the federal government offers Even Start, which
provides literacy training to both preschoolers and their parents.
There also is a literacy component to Head Start, as well as adult
literacy training provided under the Vocational Education Act.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a sign of how important reading is, education is and
how both are fundamental parts of the governor's agenda,'' said
Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer.
</P>
<P>
   The governor was detailing the plan to recruit, retrain and
retain teachers on Thursday in Pewaukee, Wis., during a two-day
campaign and fund-raising swing through the state.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who took a day off Monday, was heading out Tuesday for a
two-day East Coast swing through northern Virginia; Parsippany,
N.J.; New York and Baltimore. He also planned to visit Eau Claire,
Milwaukee and Green Bay, Wis., while in the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's fund-raisers were expected to raise more than $1.3
million, including $500,000 at a New York luncheon, $450,000 across
the Hudson River in New Jersey and $250,000 in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   The governor has delivered three major education speeches since
last fall.
</P>
<P>
   His plans call for spending $5.5 billion over five years,
although its cornerstone is not spending but accountability through
locally designed and administered tests.
</P>
<P>
   He also proposes taking away federal Title I money from poorly
performing schools and giving it to families to help defray the
cost of educating their children elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Gore has proposed spending $115 billion over 10
years to continue President Clinton's program aimed at reducing
class sizes by providing more money to hire teachers. So far, about
30,000 have been hired, with a goal of 100,000. Gore also wants to
triple the number of charter schools, make preschool available to
every 4-year-old and expand Head Start.
</P>
<P>
   Fleischer said Bush will provide the resources to ensure his
focus on accountability.
</P>
<P>
   Without getting into specifics, Fleischer said: ''Accountability
alone won't get the job done. It requires resources. It requires a
new approach. It requires carrots and sticks. If money alone would
improve our schools, we'd already have the best schools in the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   While Bush and Gore battle for the title of ''Education
President,'' the two have taken different approaches when it comes
to using public education for their own children.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's children are taught at private schools, while Bush's twin
daughters attend a public high school in Austin, Texas, after
previously studying at private schools.
</P>
<P>
   The audience Tuesday for Bush's speech is an Asian-American
business group, a follow-up to the Hispanic business audience that
sat for his first education speech in California.
</P>
<P>
   ''The governor feels that education is the key to getting a good
job, and these business groups will be the first to tell you that
what they look for in a prospective employee is a good education,
good work habits, good discipline,'' Fleischer said.

<HEADLINE> Governing Party Leads in Mexico  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- The party that has governed Mexico for 71
years still holds a narrow lead in this year's presidential race,
according to two polls published Monday by local newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Both polls showed Francisco Labastida of the Institutional
Revolutionary Party, or PRI, at least slightly ahead of Vicente Fox
of the center-right National Action Party. That represents
relatively little movement from earlier polls heading toward the
July 2 election.
</P>
<P>
   The poll published by the daily Refoma showed Labastida favored
by 39 percent of eligible voters and Fox by 32 percent. That was
the same result as a February survey and almost the same as one in
January, when Labastida had a 40-32 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The poll, conducted March 17-20, had a margin of error 2.5
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   The daily El Universal showed Labastida favored by 39.6 percent
-- up slightly from 38 percent in February. Fox was favored by 35
percent, an insignificant slip from 35.3 percent in February. That
poll, conducted March 2-14, also reported a 2.5 percent margin of
error.
</P>
<P>
   Cuauhtemoc Cardenas of the center-left Democratic Revolution
Party was favored by about 11 percent of voters in both polls.
</P>
<P>
   El Universal said that about 12 percent of those questioned
failed to answer its poll. Reforma reported a 17 percent
non-response rate.
</P>
<P>
   A third poll, published over the weekend by the national
magazine Milenio, showed Labastida at 42 percent, Fox at 39 and
Cardenas at 16. Conducted March 17-19, it reported a 2.8 percent
margin of error. It disregarded non-respondents.

<HEADLINE> Barak Still Hopes for Syrian Accord  </HEADLINE>
By DINA KRAFT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Despite disappointment at the failure of a
U.S.-Syria summit to restart talks between Syria and Israel, Prime
Minister Ehud Barak said Monday he won't close the door on the
prospects of peace with his country's longtime foe.
</P>
<P>
   With a self-imposed July deadline for an Israeli withdrawal from
Lebanon, Barak cannot afford to give up. The Syrians, on the other
hand, are willing to wait instead of take what they call a partial
and unjust withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have not closed the door even today on the continuation of
talks with the Syrians,'' Barak told lawmakers from his One Israel
bloc. He said later that the coming days would reveal whether a
peace deal was possible.
</P>
<P>
   Barak said in an interview with Israel's Channel Two TV Monday
said disagreements centered on whether a withdrawal should give
Syria access to the Sea of Galilee, and security arrangements,
including an Israeli early-warning station on Mount Hermon in the
Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
   In saying so, he indirectly confirmed what has been reported for
months -- that he is willing to meet Assad's demand to return all
land captured in the 1967 Mideast War, except for the shores of the
Galilee.
</P>
<P>
   The Syrians are likely to wait rather than take any deal that
doesn't include some of the shore, according to a Syrian source
close to the talks.
</P>
<P>
   At the weekend summit, President Clinton reportedly told Syrian
President Hafez Assad that a peace settlement may take years if no
deal was reached in the next few months.
</P>
<P>
   ''President Assad responded, 'I am not in a hurry. We are ready
to wait all those years,''' said the source, speaking on condition
of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   ''The president won't give up the Sea of Galilee. He has swum in
it, he has had meals by its shore and he has had fish from it,''
said the source. ''Like thousands of Syrian citizens, he has got
links to it.''
</P>
<P>
   A withdrawal from Lebanon without an agreement with Syria, the
main power broker there, is likely to be bloody.
</P>
<P>
   Both Lebanon and Syria have warned that they will not prevent
attacks on Israel from south Lebanon, if there is no comprehensive
peace agreement. Israel and Syria resumed peace talks in December
after a hiatus of nearly four years but they were suspended in
January.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Army chief Shaul Mofaz said that if Israel withdraws
unilaterally from the ''security zone'' it occupies in Lebanon, it
will not give up outposts along the border -- some of which protrude
up to a few hundred yards into Lebanese territory.
</P>
<P>
   Barak said he was aware of the risks of a unilateral withdrawal,
but said that ''in the long run, it will calm the situation.'' He
warned of a harsh Israeli retaliation if Israel is attacked after a
withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Mideast envoy Dennis Ross met with Barak Monday to brief
him on Sunday's failed Geneva summit between Clinton and Assad.
</P>
<P>
   Syria's Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa said the summit was
part of U.S. efforts that have so far ''not achieved the hoped for
results.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We were surprised that the U.S. president was not carrying
anything new from the Israeli side, but was asking from Syria what
might help Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak in his difficult
position, which we think is of his own making,'' Sharaa told the
Lebanese newspaper As-Safir.

<HEADLINE> OPEC Fails To Agree on Oil Output  </HEADLINE>
By BRUCE STANLEY, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- OPEC oil ministers failed to reach
agreement Monday on how much crude oil to add to global supplies,
with Iran seen as the chief obstacle to a consensus that could
provide some price relief to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The ministers were to resume discussions Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Iran accepts the need for OPEC to boost output, the Iranian Oil
Minister Bijan Namdar Zangeneh said, but the amount of an increase
favored by his country might not be enough to reduce petroleum
prices from nine-year highs.
</P>
<P>
   Zangeneh spoke before the opening Monday of the semiannual
meeting of oil ministers from all 11 members of the Organization of
the Petroleum Exporting Countries.
</P>
<P>
   ''I won't talk on numbers, but we don't want a market
shortage,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Iran, OPEC's second-largest producer, is known to favor boosting
output by about 1.2 million barrels a day -- an amount that probably
would do little to reduce world oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   An OPEC delegate, speaking on condition of anonymity, told
reporters that Libya, Indonesia and Nigeria back Iran's position.
</P>
<P>
   Two other key producers in the group, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait,
have proposed a production increase of 1.5 million to 1.7 million
barrels a day. The upper limit of their proposed increase would
amount to about 7 percent more than what OPEC members agreed to
pump after curtailing output last March.
</P>
<P>
   For U.S. motorists and other consumers of refined products such
as gasoline, much hinges on efforts by Saudi Arabia, OPEC's No. 1
producer, to win Iran over to its point of view.
</P>
<P>
   American motorists now pay an average of $1.59 per gallon for
unleaded gasoline, an increase of nearly 60 cents since prices
bottomed out at 99.8 cents per gallon in February 1999, according
to a Lundberg Survey of 10,000 U.S. gas stations released Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts warn of possible shortages and $2-a-gallon gas
during the peak driving season this summer if OPEC fails to
increase production significantly.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan sought Monday
to minimize fears raised by some U.S. lawmakers that a recent spike
in fuel prices could have a negative effect on the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ''Currently, we do not as yet -- and emphasize as yet -- see any
significant indication that crude oil price increases are in the
process of embedding themselves in other areas of the economy and
inflating the general price structure,'' he said in testimony
before a Senate committee in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan said it was unclear what level of energy inflation
would be needed to spread to other areas of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   OPEC, which operates on consensus decisions, must decide whether
to extend cuts it made in 1998 and 1999 that have propelled oil
prices to their highest levels since the 1991 Persian Gulf War. The
latest round of cuts expires at the end of the week.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. oil prices tripled to a March 8 peak of $34.37 per barrel
following OPEC's decision last March to slash production.
</P>
<P>
   Prices for U.S. West Texas intermediate crude in the United
States, world's biggest consumer of oil, and Brent crude from the
North Sea have eased somewhat in recent weeks amid optimism that
OPEC will raise output.
</P>
<P>
   Crude oil for delivery in May fell 23 cents to $27.79 a barrel
Monday on the New York Mercantile Exchange. In London, May Brent
also fell 23 cents to $25.68 on the International Petroleum
Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, world's biggest consumer of oil, has lobbied
the cartel to raise production. The government has said that an
increase of 2 million to 2.5 million barrels per day is needed to
replenish inventories and satisfy growing world demand.
</P>
<P>
   OPEC pumps more than 26 million barrels of crude each day, or
about 35 percent of the world's supply. Key non-OPEC producers,
such as Mexico and Norway which cut back their production in tandem
with OPEC, have said they are watching to see what OPEC will do
before adjusting their own output.
</P>
<P>
   The Saudis want to stabilize prices at a level that won't cause
extreme economic pain for the nations that buy its oil. If high
prices start damaging economies, producers fear that demand for oil
-- and OPEC's export earnings -- could plummet.
</P>
<P>
   OPEC members currently are producing about 1.2 million barrels a
day over the cartel's quota. The quota increase sought by Iran
would just about ''legitimize'' that amount but would fall short of
adding more crude to the work's inventories.
</P>
<P>
   Libya added to the uncertainty about the outcome of the
semiannual meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Abdalla Salem El-Badri, head of Libya's National Oil Corp. told
reporters that he was still concerned that global demand for oil
might decline in the second quarter of the year, when demand for
oil and refined products historically dips to its annual ebb. He
suggested Libya would like to see production raised later this
year.

<HEADLINE> Feds To Review R.I. Cop Shooting  </HEADLINE>
By JULIE GOODMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- Rep. Patrick Kennedy said Monday that a
federal review is under way into the shooting death of a black
policemen shot by two white officers who mistook him for a suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Invoking the words of his uncle, President Kennedy, the
Democratic congressman delivered remarks punctuated by clapping,
prayer and song in a crowded Baptist church.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said he spoke with two Department of Justice officials
about Sgt. Cornel Young Jr., the off-duty black officer fatally
shot Jan. 28 by two white officers who mistook him for a suspect.
</P>
<P>
   ''Without hesitation ... both men gave me every assurance that
there will be an undeniable and thorough federal review of this
senseless shooting,'' he said of Deputy Attorney General Eric
Holder and Acting Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights, Bill
Lann Lee.
</P>
<P>
   The long term review will go beyond the preliminary inquiry the
FBI has already opened, Kennedy said. At the end of the review,
officials could enforce civil rights laws even if the state grand
jury investigating the case does not find any criminal wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   At the Congdon Street Baptist Church, the congressman quoted a
1963 speech by President Kennedy, saying ''If an American, because
his skin is dark cannot enjoy the full and free life which all of
us want, then who among us would be content to have the color of
his skin changed and stand in his place?''
</P>
<P>
   Civil rights leaders have repeatedly demanded an independent
investigation into the case.

<HEADLINE> Japan Air Pilots Strike Over Wages  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Pilots at Japan Airlines Co., the nation's largest
carrier, entered a 24-hour strike Tuesday to demand a wage
increase, pilot union officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The walkout will not cause any flight cancellations because
higher-ranking senior pilots will replace the striking pilots for
all scheduled flights for Tuesday, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Phone calls to JAL went unanswered early Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's strike by the 1,330-member JAL Flight Crew Union
affected only flights departing from the international airport at
Narita, just outside Tokyo, and from Haneda airport inside the
capital.
</P>
<P>
   As part of so-called ''spring labor offensive'' negotiations
held annually by Japanese labor unions, the pilots demanded a more
than 3 percent raise, but JAL management refused to comply, said a
union official who demanded anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The striking pilots also demanded that JAL abandon plans to
reduce costs by cutting retirement allowances, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   The pilots have threatened to strike again Wednesday if their
demands are not met, a union statement said.
</P>
<P>
   The union declined to disclose average pilot salaries.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese media have in recent weeks reported that JAL, under
pressure to reduce debt, plans to lower salaries in a companywide
cost-cutting program.

<HEADLINE> Judge Criticizes Giuliani on Cases  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A federal appeals court judge said Monday the
Giuliani administration's ''relentless onslaught of First Amendment
litigation'' has put the courts in danger of having to perform
crucial government functions.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Guido Calabresi of the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
made the comments in a 63-page ruling questioning the rationality
of the city's efforts to stop photographer Spencer Tunick from
taking nude pictures in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Tunick has been arrested five times for staging photographs of
dozens of nude bodies lined up on bridges and streets in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Calabresi noted the heavy volume of First Amendment cases
amassed by the administration of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. The
mayor's critics say he is trying to squelch free speech.
</P>
<P>
   ''As a result of this relentless onslaught of First Amendment
litigation, the federal courts have, to a considerable extent, been
drafted into the role of local licensors for the city of New
York,'' Calabresi said.
</P>
<P>
   He noted 18 prominent cases in which the appeals court or a
lower federal court had temporarily blocked the city or found one
of its actions or policies unconstitutional on First Amendment
grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Calabresi said the federal courts had a responsibility to uphold
First Amendment and other constitutional rights and balance those
rights against the state's interest in enforcing its laws and
values.
</P>
<P>
   ''But, in the current and rather remarkable state of affairs in
New York City, there is an all too clear danger that the courts,
instead of merely interpreting and defending federal rights, may
cross the line and become, in effect, an agency that performs
crucial local government functions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Michael D. Hess, the city's chief lawyer, said Calabresi was
''being a little bit unfair.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I think there's too much of an acceptance of these glib
comments that the mayor crushes people's First Amendment rights,''
he said, claiming that the city had won or gained substantial
ground with most of its First Amendment cases.
</P>
<P>
   ''The mayor doesn't say you can't talk at all,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hess said Giuliani seeks to ensure that First Amendment speech
does not infringe on the constitutional rights of others.

<HEADLINE> Doctor in Lewis Case Wants Dismissal  </HEADLINE>
By JIMMY GOLEN, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- A doctor being sued in the Reggie Lewis case
sought Monday to dismiss the lawsuit because a magazine article
tainted a prospective juror's views.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Thayer Fremont-Smith denied the request, but did excuse
the prospective juror, who said she had seen news reports in which
the former Boston Celtics star's widow compared herself to the
widows of six firefighters who died in a warehouse fire.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, another prospective juror, a firefighter, was
dismissed after he said he was troubled by Donna Harris-Lewis'
remarks.
</P>
<P>
   ''You know, I think about those firefighters in Worcester. Lots
of money is being raised for those families, and I need to be taken
care of, too,'' Harris-Lewis told Boston Magazine for its April
issue. ''Everybody has to say I'm greedy. But I do want my money
back this time around. Why should I lose?''
</P>
<P>
   Jury selection began Monday for the second malpractice trial of
Dr. Gilbert Mudge, whose first trial ended in a deadlocked jury.
Opening arguments are scheduled to begin April 3, and the trial is
expected to last four to five weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen jurors were selected by the end of Monday's court
session. Two more were to be selected Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors were asked the standard questions about whether they had
any relationship with the plaintiffs, defendants or their lawyers.
But they were also asked whether they would not be able to render
an impartial decision because of loyalty to the NBA team; only
three raised their hands.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis collapsed in April 1993 during a Celtics playoff game, and
doctors initially diagnosed the problem as a potentially fatal
heart arrhythmia. But Lewis and his wife were unhappy with the
diagnosis and transferred hospitals, hiring a ''Dream Team,''
including Mudge, who said the player suffered from a benign
fainting disorder.
</P>
<P>
   Mudge publicly pronounced in May 1993 that Lewis could play
basketball ''without limitation.'' On July 27, 1993, Lewis
collapsed at the Celtics' practice facility and died.
</P>
<P>
   Harris-Lewis sued four doctors for malpractice. John D.
Rutherford, of the University of Houston, settled the lawsuit out
of court in April 1999 for a reported $500,000; two other doctors,
Mark A. Creager and Peter L. Friedman, were exonerated last year
after a seven-week trial.
</P>
<P>
   But the same jury deadlocked on the claims against Mudge, who
claimed that Lewis admitted shortly before his death that he had
used cocaine. The lawyers said the revelations explained why an
accurate diagnosis of Lewis' condition was impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Harris-Lewis denied the drug use.

<HEADLINE> Airline, Cargo Handler Plead Guilty  </HEADLINE>
By CATHERINE WILSON, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- A freight airline and a cargo handler pleaded
guilty Monday and agreed to pay $5 million in criminal fines after
an investigation into a 1997 crash that killed five people near
Miami International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Fine Air and cargo handler Aeromar pleaded guilty to a total of
five counts of obstruction of justice and making false statements
during the crash investigation. Attorneys for both stressed that
the pleas do not cover the cause of the crash, attributed to
inexperienced cargo loaders.
</P>
<P>
   The pleas were the first signal that an investigation into the
crash had produced criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
   ''These convictions soundly defeat the contention that aircraft
accidents should not be the subject of criminal prosecutions,''
said U.S. Attorney Tom Scott.
</P>
<P>
   In its plea, Fine Air admitted its supervisors ordered
subordinates to change flight weight charts and manifests in the
days after the crash and lied to the FAA about mandated inspections
and corrosion on components.
</P>
<P>
   Aeromar admitted taping over a warehouse surveillance tape
showing crews preparing pallets for the flight and destroying forms
on cargo weight. Although the cargo handler also acknowledged
falsifying pallet weight sheets by at least 3 tons, the DC-8 crash
was blamed on the in-flight movement of unsecured pallets rather
than overweight cargo.
</P>
<P>
   About 45 tons of fabric destined for a blue jeans factory
shifted seconds after takeoff Aug. 7, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Fine Air was responsible for loading the aircraft, but
investigators found Aeromar employees did it at the direction of a
security guard.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plea agreement, no company officers or employees will
be charged, regulators will not pursue additional charges, and both
companies stay in business. U.S. District Judge Joan Lenard can
accept or reject the plea at sentencing June 20.
</P>
<P>
   ''The totality and the finality of the plea made it attractive
to the company,'' said Aeromar attorney Richard Sharpstein. ''It
ends years of speculation after what was purely a tragic
accident.''
</P>
<P>
   Criminal investigations have been rare after commercial crashes.
</P>
<P>
   In December, an aircraft maintenance company implicated in the
1996 ValuJet crash became the first convicted at trial of criminal
charges involving a U.S. commercial jet crash.

Gore proposed creating a $7.1 billion endowment to pay for House and Senate
campaigns, new disclosure rules for lobbyists and outside groups that pay for
political ads and mandatory free ''rebuttal'' time for candidates targeted by

OPEC Strives For Production Boost
</SUBHEAD>

   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- After the first day of meetings, the OPEC oil
ministers failed to reach a consensus about how much crude oil to add to global
supplies. Iran is seen as the chief obstacle to reaching an agreement. Iranian
Oil Minister Bijan Namdar Zangeneh said that although he agrees that a boost is
needed, he does not think that the amount Iran is willing to produce would help

Report: Poor Paying Much for Housing

   CHICAGO (AP) -- A federal report released today shows that a record number of
working-poor families -- at least 5.4 million -- were paying more than half
their income for housing or living in substandard conditions in 1997. That's an
increase of 12 percent since 1991. The report is being presented to Congress,
which is considering a bill that includes $690 million for 120,000 new rental
assistance vouchers to be distributed in cities nationwide. Housing and Urban
Development officials said incomes for average Americans are growing at a rate
roughly 30 percent greater than incomes for the poorest Americans.

Vitamin C May Hurt Cancer Patients
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Cancer patients who take large doses of vitamin C in the
hope of a cure might actually make their disease worse by inadvertently
protecting their tumors from radiation and chemotherapy, new research suggests.
Doctors caution they cannot prove the vitamin is harmful during cancer
treatment. But they say there are strong biological reasons to think megadoses
could be bad. The concern is based on the discovery that cancer cells actually
contain large amounts of vitamin C, which appears to protect them from oxygen
damage. Many cancer treatments, especially radiation therapy, work by triggering
oxygen damage to the genes of cancer cells.

close at 11,025.85. On the NYSE, losers led gainers 1,704-1,284. The Nasdaq
composite index fell 4.47 to 4,958.56. Microsoft, the most actively traded
Nasdaq stock, fell 7| to 104 1/16.

Canucks' Brashear Back at Practice
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   BURNABY, British Columbia (AP) -- Donald Brashear practiced today for the
first time since Boston defenseman Marty McSorley's stick attack left the
Vancouver forward with a concussion. Brashear, a 6-foot-2, 225-pound left
winger, hasn't played since McSorley hit him over the head in the closing
seconds of a Feb. 21 game. Canucks coach Marc Crawford said Brashear will join
the team for a three-game road trip that opens Wednesday in Detroit and could
play as early as next week.

Bernardo's Hopes for New Trial Dashed
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- Paul Bernardo's hopes for a new trial were
abruptly dashed Monday as a three-judge panel dismissed the
notorious sex killer's appeal of his 1995 first-degree murder
conviction.
</P>
<P>
   After a full day of arguments from a battery of defense lawyers,
it took just 15 minutes for the Ontario Court of Appeal to dismiss
the case without so much as a word of rebuttal from the other side.
</P>
<P>
   ''None of us was persuaded that we needed to hear from the
Crown,'' Justice John Laskin told court as Debbie Mahaffy, whose
daughter Leslie was murdered by Bernardo in 1991, smiled broadly.
</P>
<P>
   ''This appeal is dismissed.''
</P>
<P>
   The panel was left unmoved by a series of complicated and often
meandering arguments on supposed errors in law by Justice Patrick
LeSage during Bernardo's four-month trial in 1995.

Manning Launches Leadership Bid in Canadian Alliance
</P>
<P>
   CALGARY (AP) -- Calling himself an agent of change who can lead
the Canadian Alliance to power in Ottawa, Preston Manning began the
fight of his political life Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Manning, who led the Reform party from obscurity to official
Opposition in 10 years, is now seeking control of the Alliance --
which he hopes will become a new national small-c conservative
coalition able to defeat the Liberals.
</P>
<P>
   ''The campaign for the leadership of the Canadian Alliance is
more than a campaign to choose a leader for a new political
party,'' Manning said to about 150 cheering supporters, including
several MPs.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a campaign to choose our next prime minister and the
leader of a new government.

Chretien Not Worried About Fate of Federal Referendum
</P>
<P>
   OTTAWA (AP) -- Prime Minister Jean Chretien dismissed fears of a
Senate revolt Monday and said he's confident the upper house will
ratify his proposed federal ground rules for the next Quebec
referendum.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative senators who oppose the so-called clarity bill hope
to win over enough Liberals to stall or amend the legislation that
passed the Commons last week.
</P>
<P>
   Their chief complaint is that the bill doesn't give the Senate
enough of a say in deciding whether the question and majority are
clear in any future plebiscite on Quebec separation.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberals have a comfortable working majority in the Senate,
where they hold 53 seats to 41 for the Tories and five
Independents.

Convicted Murderer Won't Reveal Role in String of Murders
</P>
<P>
   FREDERICTON (AP) -- Convicted killer Michael Wayne McGray is now
refusing to reveal his self-proclaimed role in a string of murders
that could establish him as the worst serial killer in Canadian
history.
</P>
<P>
   McGray, serving a life sentence in Renous, New Brunswick, for
the 1998 murder of a Newfoundland woman, has clammed up after
giving interviews to the news media last week in which he claimed
to have been involved in as many as 16 murders across North
America.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's not talking, so there's not a whole lot anyone can do
right now,'' Const. Roland Cormier of the RCMP in Moncton said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   RCMP investigators from Halifax had hoped to speak with McGray
on Monday but that has been put off until later in the week.
</P>
<P>
   A source in the New Brunswick legal community said Monday that
McGray wants time to himself and is unhappy about the way his
comments were treated by the news media. The source said McGray
believes he was misquoted, so he has decided to say nothing. ---
Red Cross Having Trouble Selling Compensation Plan to Hepatitis C
Victims
</P>
<P>
   OTTAWA (AP) -- The Canadian Red Cross is having trouble selling
its plan to compensate tainted blood victims and there's
speculation the agency, which has already lost its blood business,
may be forced into bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Cross has been under court protection since July 20,
1998 and has requested several deadline extensions as it struggled
to satisfy creditors and tainted blood claimants.
</P>
<P>
   The society's compensation package, to be made public April 10,
is aimed at victims excluded from the $1.2-billion
federal-provincial plan announced two years ago for those infected
between 1986 and 1990.
</P>
<P>
   To qualify for the Red Cross offer, victims would have to waive
their right to sue the agency and some victims feel they'd be
better off in court.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Cross must submit its compensation package to a vote by
victims. If it's rejected, claimants will likely proceed with
damage claims of billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Red Cross spokesman Bob Rae insisted Monday that talk of
bankruptcy is premature, saying the agency is still negotiating
with governments and victims.

<HEADLINE> Japan Insurance Cos. To Merge  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Sumitomo Marine &AMP; Fire Insurance Co. and Mitsui
Marine &AMP; Fire Insurance Co. plan to complete their previously
disclosed merger in October 2001 and eliminate 20.7 percent of
their combined work force by 2005 to cut costs.
</P>
<P>
   The merger between Sumitomo Marine, Japan's fourth-largest
non-life insurer, and Mitsui Marine, the nation's third-largest
non-life insurer, would create Japan's largest non-life insurance
company.
</P>
<P>
   The companies said Monday they expect to eliminate 3,000 of the
combined company's 14,500 jobs by 2005 through attrition,
postponing the hiring of new employees and transferring others to
affiliated companies.
</P>
<P>
   The companies expect to have $55.4 billion in assets at the time
of the merger, and said are setting a market share target of more
than 18 percent over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   The current leader among non-life insurance companies in Japan
is Tokio Marine &AMP; Fire Insurance Co. with $50.72 billion in assets.
</P>
<P>
   Mitsui Marine decided to merge with Sumitomo Marine in February,
after it canceled a planned combination with Nippon Fire &AMP; Marine
Insurance Co. and Koa Fire &AMP; Marine Insurance Co.

<HEADLINE> Real-Life Brockovich Even Brasher  </HEADLINE>
By CHRISTINE HANLEY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KETTLEMAN HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- In the No. 1 hit ''Erin
Brockovich,'' many moviegoers are seeing how a brash young legal
secretary forced Pacific Gas &AMP; Electric Co. to pay a record $333
million settlement for poisoning the water in a small California
desert town.
</P>
<P>
   But the movie's story of environmental villainy is only the
beginning of the legal and public relations nightmare Brockovich
has created for the utility company.
</P>
<P>
   A bigger, broader lawsuit is headed to trial in November against
San Francisco-based PG&AMP;E and one of its main suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,500 employees, their families, other residents and
farmers who lived or worked near three PG&AMP;E gas-compressor plants
contend their water supplies also were contaminated with harmful
levels of cancer-causing chromium 6 from the 1950s to the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   The tough-talking, streetwise Brockovich is trying to find every
last person who may have been exposed. Being portrayed on screen by
Julia Roberts hasn't hurt. In the movie's first week, 40 to 50
potential plaintiffs called.
</P>
<P>
   ''We won't feel resolved -- morally, ethically, or legally --
until we have found everyone we were supposed to,'' said
Brockovich, 39. ''And I will keep working until we do.''
</P>
<P>
   PG&AMP;E has said little about the accuracy of the movie or its
effect on the litigation.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our general response with respect to the movie is just that we
recognize it's a dramatization. It's an entertainment vehicle,''
spokesman Greg Pruett said. He added that PG&AMP;E officials ''don't
really have any thoughts'' about how the film might affect the
company's image or influence jurors.
</P>
<P>
   ''I will say this: I do believe that when the case is brought to
trial, we will mount a very spirited and vigorous defense,'' he
said. ''And we are confident we will be successful in that
defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Brockovich, who was hired by lawyer Ed Masry even though she had
no college degree or technical experience, was looking at files for
a real estate case in 1992 when she found medical reports about low
T-cell counts and other blood problems among residents of the town
of Hinkley.
</P>
<P>
   Curious, she drove her beat-up car out to the Mojave Desert town
-- about 100 miles northeast of Los Angeles -- and began a quest that
lasted four years.
</P>
<P>
   ''Erin did most of the work,'' Masry, played by Albert Finney in
the movie, said of the research that uncovered the Hinkley
pollution scandal that brought compensation for 652 Hinkley
residents in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Brockovich earned $2 million for herself. But she wasn't done
snooping around.
</P>
<P>
   Suspecting similar problems at other PG&AMP;E plants, Brockovich and
Masry drove out to Kettleman Hills in California's Central Valley,
where employees and their families once lived onsite in a complex
they called Camp PG&AMP;E.
</P>
<P>
   Masry looked at the cooling towers and the buildings abandoned
in the mid-1980s and saw no sign of contamination. He told
Brockovich to drop it.
</P>
<P>
   But she noticed a white powder on the needles of the tamarisk
trees, an abnormality she remembered from Hinkley. And soon, she
was at it again, mining records and tracking down anyone who lived
or worked at Kettleman.
</P>
<P>
   Among the boxloads of documents she copied was a 1964 letter
from the U.S. Interior Department notifying PG&AMP;E about unhealthy
levels of chromium 6 in Kettleman's water well.
</P>
<P>
   The Kettleman plaintiffs accuse PG&AMP;E of contaminating the water
they used for drinking, bathing, swimming and watering crops. They
say the water gave them everything from nosebleeds to fatal
diseases.
</P>
<P>
   The case also includes about 150 people from Hinkley who missed
out on the first lawsuit and about 20 from a plant in Topock, on
the California-Arizona line, who also claim they were sickened by
chromium. Also being sued is Betz Laboratories Inc. of
Pennsylvania, which supplied the chromium, one of the chemicals
used to cool natural gas.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the lawsuit depicted in the movie, PG&AMP;E has not offered
binding arbitration, which would bring a swift outcome. Lawyers for
the plaintiffs say PG&AMP;E is trying to prolong the proceedings so
that there will be fewer survivors.
</P>
<P>
   PG&AMP;E declined to respond to that allegation or any other related
to the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Praglin, one of the lawyers for the plaintiffs, said at
least 50 people have died since the case was filed about five years
ago. Their include cancer, kidney and liver diseases, serious
respiratory problems and colon diseases like Crohn's.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth Ann Vaughn, who spent the first 10 of her 47 years at Camp
PG&AMP;E, recalls the innocent days she spent floating boats carved
from Ivory soap in the cooling ponds, or being sprayed by the mist
from the cooling towers as she rode on the handlebars of her
brother's bike to buy bubblegum from a company snack machine.
</P>
<P>
   She blames chromium exposure for her Crohn's disease and the
loss of her sister and mother, who died of multiple organ failure
in the early 1990s. And she wants PG&AMP;E to pay.
</P>
<P>
   ''They need to take care of the people they've harmed,'' Vaughn
said, her voice cracking. ''They've killed innocent children, moms,
dads and families, for profit. And then instead of doing the right
thing, they continue to cover it up and they're making us victims
again.''

<HEADLINE> Tensions Rise Over Cuban Boy  </HEADLINE>
By MILDRADE CHERFILS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- With the Justice Department threatening to take
Elian Gonzalez from his Miami relatives, a crowd gathered outside
the boy's Little Havana home Monday, holding a vigil and ready to
form a human chain if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   The risk of a confrontation over the 6-year-old boy appeared to
grow as the government and the Miami relatives traded accusations.
The relatives were so worried that Elian would be taken away by
Cuban agents that they kept him home from school.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno has demanded that the Miami
relatives pursue any court appeals rapidly and promise to surrender
Elian for return to his father in Cuba if they lose.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, an appellate judge granted requests by the relatives
and the Justice Department for an expedited appeal, giving the
relatives' attorneys several days more to prepare their arguments
than the government would have preferred.
</P>
<P>
   But the relatives have not addressed the government's other
demand.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the relatives filed their latest appeal -- and asked
that the case get expedited handling -- but they have not addressed
the other demand.
</P>
<P>
   ''That being so, the INS is under no obligation to maintain the
current arrangement,'' the government wrote in response, referring
to the deal giving Elian's great-uncle custody in the meantime.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department spokeswoman Carole Florman would not say what
the government would do next. She said the department would send
the family a letter outlining its plans.
</P>
<P>
   The agency has made it clear it would not want to do anything to
traumatize the boy or provoke Miami's large Cuban community.
</P>
<P>
   About 100 people held a candlelight vigil outside his Little
Havana home Monday evening. Earlier, a small group spilled into the
streets waving a large Cuban flag but did not block traffic.
Someone put a 15-foot banner in front of the house with a drawing
of Elian and a message: ''I just want to live in freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the protesters responded to a call by the Democracy
Movement, an anti-Castro group, to be prepared to form a human
chain around the home if the government tries to remove the child
and send him back to his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are a lot of people who aren't willing to kill but are
willing to die only for the child's rights,'' said Ramon Saul
Sanchez, head of the Democracy Movement.
</P>
<P>
   Olga Scott, 50, arrived from Houston Monday to join the protest.
''Over our dead bodies, they will not take him,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In an apparent effort to increase American support for their
battle to keep Elian, the child's relatives last week allowed ABC's
Diane Sawyer to spend two days with Elian. The result was his first
extended interview. The first of three segments aired Monday on
''Good Morning America.''
</P>
<P>
   In the segment broadcast Monday, Elian was not asked whether he
wants to return to Cuba. He described how the boat that was
bringing him and his mother from Cuba sank, and he said he doesn't
believe his mother is dead.
</P>
<P>
   Elian drew crayon pictures of the voyage in which his mother and
10 other people drowned. He was found clinging to an inner tube on
Thanksgiving and placed with his relatives in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ''My mother is not in heaven, not lost,'' he said in Spanish
through his cousin Marisleysis Gonzalez. ''She must have been
picked up here in Miami somewhere. She must have lost her memory,
and just doesn't know I'm here.''
</P>
<P>
   Marisleysis Gonzalez gently reminded him that he knows what
really happened to his mother, and he continued gazing downward.
</P>
<P>
   Elian remained home Monday, and family spokesman Armando
Gutierrez said he won't return to school out of fears that Cuba
might try to force him back to the communist island. On Monday,
Castro mocked Cuban exiles who said they feared he would launch an
armed raid to repatriate the boy.
</P>
<P>
   Teacher Obdulia Copa left the boy's home at the end of the
school day and confirmed that she will be teaching the child at
home for the rest of the week and possibly until the custody
dispute is resolved.
</P>
<P>
   The family wants the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in
Atlanta to overturn a federal judge's ruling last week affirming
the Immigration and Naturalization Service's decision to return
Elian to Cuba. The family asked that the case get a speeded-up
handling.
</P>
<P>
   The court responded by asking for the family to file briefs by
April 10 and for the government to respond by April 24. Any
response to the government by Elian's relatives must be filed by
May 1. The court will not grant any extensions, said Robert Phelps,
chief deputy clerk. Oral arguments in Atlanta are set for the week
of May 8.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Osberg-Braun, an attorney for Elian's Miami relatives,
insisted the family has complied with the government's demands.
</P>
<P>
   ''In light of our cooperation, we request that your officials
cease their constant threats to revoke Elian's parole,'' the
attorneys wrote in a letter to Reno.
</P>
<P>
   In a rare move, the family allowed a few reporters inside the
house to show them an image that had appeared in an oval mirror.
Tears flowed down the cheeks of Lazaro Gonzalez, Elian's
great-uncle, as he stared at a form he claimed was the Virgin Mary.

<HEADLINE> Bill would increase pay for lawmakers, constitutional officers  </HEADLINE>
By ADAM GORLICK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- The governor's salary would nearly double
and legislators would get their second pay raise in three years
under a bill approved Monday by a legislative committee.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would hike the governor's pay from $78,000 to $150,000
in 2003, the first pay raise for that office since 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. John G. Rowland has not taken a public stance on the
proposed raises.
</P>
<P>
   ''At this point, it's in the hands of the Legislature,'' said
Dean Pagani, Rowland's spokesman. ''The governor will make a
decision if it passes the General Assembly and comes to his desk.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill would also boost the salaries of the lieutenant
governor, secretary of the state, attorney general and treasurer,
which were last raised in January, 1999. Rank-and-file members of
the state's part-time General Assembly received a $5,100 raise last
year, to $21,788. Under the bill, those salaries would be raised to
$28,000 in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Robert Genuario, R-Norwalk, said he's uncomfortable with
the proposed raises, said it is too soon for lawmakers to be taking
home more cash for their elected jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe that the constitutional officers are woefully
underpaid and entitled to a raise,'' said Genuario. ''I'm a little
troubled with legislative raises because we passed a significant
raise for legislators last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Genuario voted for the bill -- which passed 41-7 to the House --
but said he would not support it on the floor if it still includes
a raise for members of the General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Terry Backer, D-Stratford, said the pay raises are
needed for the part-time lawmakers who put in full-time hours.
</P>
<P>
   ''The longer you're in office, the more responsibilities you
pick up and the more time you spend here,'' Backer said. ''And you
become more dependent on your wages here because you're working
fewer hours and making less money at whatever your other job is.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to their salaries, House members receive $4,500 a
year in travel expenses. Senators get $5,500.
</P>
<P>
   Legislative leaders, who already receive more money than rank
and file, would also get a raise. The salaries of the Senate
president pro tempore and House speaker would be raised from
$30,108 to $38,689. Minority leaders would also get $8,000 raises.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also would increase the salaries of judges. The Supreme
Court chief justice's pay would be raised in 2002 from $140,582 to
$149,582, and the chief court administrator's salary would be
boosted from $134,738 to $143,738. Superior Court judges would make
$125,000 in 2002, $9,000 more than they will earn in 2001.

<HEADLINE> Rwanda Suspects' Lawyers Want Report  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLE WINFIELD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Lawyers for suspects in Rwanda's 1994 genocide
called Monday on the U.N. Tribunal for Rwanda to turn over a
confidential document that they say could have bolstered their
clients' defense.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers also questioned the ethics of the U.N. prosecutors
who, for nearly 2{ years, failed to comply with attorneys' requests
for the document, which they say could help counter charges that
their clients planned the massacres.
</P>
<P>
   ''As a lawyer, I'm extremely concerned that an event that
obviously has been considered to be this relevant for the United
Nations was not shared with the defense, and in fact its existence
was denied,'' said Attorney Tiphaine Dickson.
</P>
<P>
   The report concerns the April 6, 1994 death of Rwandan President
Juvenal Habyarimana, a Hutu, which sparked the violence that led to
the genocide of an estimated 500,000 people, most of them Tutsis
and politically moderate Hutus.
</P>
<P>
   Hutu extremists in the former army and the government have long
been thought responsible for downing Habyarimana's airplane in a
bid to sabotage his efforts to implement a power-sharing deal with
the Tutsi-led Rwandan Patriotic Front.
</P>
<P>
   A Canadian newspaper reported March 1 that three Tutsi
informants had told U.N. investigators in 1997 that they were part
of an elite strike team that downed the plane.
</P>
<P>
   Citing a confidential U.N. report, The National Post quoted the
three informants as saying the killing was carried out under the
command of Paul Kagame, who headed the Rwandan Patriotic Front and
is currently the Rwandan vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Rwandan officials have rejected the report as false and said the
tribunal's refusal to pursue the investigation proved that the
report was untrue.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations has now said it would turn over a copy of the
report for the tribunal, which would then decide whether to release
it. Tribunal prosecutors have maintained that their mandate only
covered crimes committed during the genocide itself, not before.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the accused say any such report would have helped
undermine one of the prosecution's main arguments: that the
genocide was premeditated by Hutus.
</P>
<P>
   The three-page report, dated Aug. 1, 1997, was not turned over
to the U.N. tribunal because it was an internal document, the U.N.
Office of Legal Affairs said in a March 22 letter.
</P>
<P>
   But the office said its contents were discussed with the chief
prosecutor, Louise Arbour, in September 1997. Arbour is now a
Supreme Court Justice in Canada and has not responded to requests
for comment about the report.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> 49ers 'No. 1 Fan' Dies at 79  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Lido Starelli, who attended every San
Francisco 49ers home game except one and was honored as the team's
top fan, is dead of cancer. He was 79.
</P>
<P>
   Starelli, who died Sunday, was tagged the team's No. 1 fan in
1998 by the 49ers, and was rewarded with a trip to the Pro Football
Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Starelli's remarkable run began at the team's first home game,
Sept. 1, 1946, at Kezar Stadium against the Chicago Rockets.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's all it took,'' he said in 1996. ''From there I just
went.''
</P>
<P>
   The only game Starelli missed was on Dec. 5, 1959 -- the day his
father died.
</P>
<P>
   While Starelli said he liked the teams from the '40s and '50s
best, his favorite play was ''The Catch,'' Dwight Clark's 1981
touchdown reception that sent the team to its first Super Bowl,
ending years of futility.
</P>
<P>
   ''When Clark made that catch, I was crying like a baby,''
Starelli said. ''Tears of agony had become tears of ecstasy.''
</P>
<P>
   Starelli was always superstitious where his favorite team was
concerned. He took a city bus to every game, wore the same clothes
and would enter Candlestick Park through the same gate, handing his
ticket to the same employee.
</P>
<P>
   Starelli is believed to have the only complete set of programs
from every game the team has played, home and away. He kept them in
a basement room at his San Francisco home that became a shrine to
the team.
</P>
<P>
   Starelli also collected every 49ers media guide, lapel pin,
stationery Christmas card and pocket schedule from the last half
century.
</P>
<P>
   ''Receiving the No. 1 fan award was the thrill of his life,''
his son John told the San Francisco Examiner on Sunday. ''He lived
and breathed the 49ers since 1946.''

<HEADLINE> Reds' Deion Back With Big Leaguers  </HEADLINE>
By JOE KAY, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT CHARLOTTE, Fla. (AP) -- With both Cincinnati Reds and Dallas
Cowboys fans cheering him on Monday, Deion Sanders got back to
major league baseball -- and got a hit, too.
</P>
<P>
   With two black batting gloves flapping from each of his back
pockets and a thick gold chain and jeweled cross dangling from his
neck, Sanders played in his second spring training game as a
replacement left fielder.
</P>
<P>
   He also got a couple of at-bats in Cincinnati's 9-8 loss to the
Texas Rangers. Sanders grounded out to second and lined a single to
left, then slid in hard at second base as the Rangers
unsuccessfully tried to turn a double play.
</P>
<P>
   ''Any time you get to play with the big guys, that's definitely
a step forward,'' Sanders said.
</P>
<P>
   His reemergence was an indication he could be back with the Reds
sooner than expected. Sanders, in camp on a minor league contract,
has missed most of spring training because of a balky knee and a
swollen ankle.
</P>
<P>
   A day after Dr. Timothy Kremchek predicted it would take Sanders
four more weeks to get into top playing shape, the outfielder
diplomatically disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ''How can I put this gently: That's Dr. Kremchek's opinion,''
Sanders said. ''I feel good running.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys cornerback had arthroscopic surgery on his right
knee on Jan. 24 and could only hobble last month when he resumed a
baseball career put on hold in 1997. He didn't move well in a
split-squad game on March 14, going 0-for-3.
</P>
<P>
   His right ankle later swelled up, requiring a cortisone shot 11
days ago. He had spent the last few days playing in minor league
games.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds don't need another outfielder -- they already have five
-- but general manager Jim Bowden would love to have Sanders
available as a pinch runner as soon as he's healthy.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders seems headed for Triple-A Louisville to show what he can
do. How long he'll be there is the question.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a nice plan,'' Sanders said. ''If they feel that's
where I need to go to do rehab, I'll do so.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowden was back in Cincinnati on Monday, missing the return of
one of his favorite players.
</P>
<P>
   A buzz went through the crowd of 4,519 when Sanders, wearing No.
12, moved into the on-deck circle in the sixth inning to pinch hit
for Ken Griffey Jr. He didn't get to bat that inning because Chris
Stynes made the last out, but stayed in the game as the left
fielder.
</P>
<P>
   He grounded out to second on the first pitch in the seventh,
then worked R.A. Dickey -- a non-roster pitcher wearing No. 74 -- to
a 3-1 count before lining a single to left.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been feeling well for -- I'm not going to say quite some
time, but especially this past week,'' Sanders said. ''I don't
judge my speed. I know a couple of weeks ago they told me I wasn't
really running good, then yesterday Mr. Bowden told me I must have
turned it up 10 notches.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after he made it to the small visitors' clubhouse after
the game, former Cowboys coach Chan Gailey walked in and the two of
them talked. Gailey, who coached Dallas for two years, was fired
after the 1999 season and became the Miami Dolphins' offensive
coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is really good (to see him),'' Sanders said. ''He's all
right and that's the best thing, that he's all right.''

<HEADLINE> Report: Poor Paying Much for Housing  </HEADLINE>
By MARTHA IRVINE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- With the bank foreclosing on her landlord's
building, Magdalena Mendez needs to find an apartment for herself
and her five children -- fast. But the Chicago salon assistant is
having a hard time finding what she wants: a three-bedroom for less
than $800 a month in the same neighborhood as her children's
schools.
</P>
<P>
   She's not alone. A federal report released Monday shows that a
record number of working-poor families -- at least 5.4 million --
were paying more than half their income for housing or living in
substandard conditions in 1997, the freshest figures available.
That's an increase of 12 percent since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The report is being presented to Congress, which is considering
a bill that includes $690 million for 120,000 new rental assistance
vouchers to be distributed in cities nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everything is going so well (economically), it's hard to
imagine that we have such a terrible housing shortage,'' Housing
and Urban Development Secretary Andrew Cuomo told reporters Monday.
''But actually the strong economy is one of the reasons we have a
lack of affordable housing.''
</P>
<P>
   Housing and Urban Development officials said incomes for average
Americans are growing at a rate roughly 30 percent greater than
incomes for the poorest Americans. That, in turn, is driving up
rents and home prices from San Francisco and Seattle to Chicago and
Tampa.
</P>
<P>
   ''They want the city back,'' Mendez said of suburbanites and
others who are moving into pricey condominiums and rehabilitated
homes just blocks from the three-unit building she must leave
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's upsetting to those of us who've always worked and lived
here in the city -- who have an education, who work hard and who
still can't get what we want,'' said Mendez, a 34-year-old Chicago
native who paid $350 a month for her top-floor apartment in that
building. She figures it could now rent for $1,000 a month if it's
rehabbed, and that's more than she makes in a month.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that gentrification is a new concept. But statistics
show that it is an accelerating one.
</P>
<P>
   Consider San Francisco's Mission District, a working-class,
predominately Hispanic neighborhood that is quickly turning
upscale. In New York, old tenement buildings on Manhattan's Lower
East Side are being converted into luxury units.
</P>
<P>
   Federal researchers have found that the nation is losing
low-income housing units at an increasingly alarming rate -- 400,000
units between 1993 and 1997, compared with 425,000 between 1985 and
1993. Officials at Harvard University's Joint Center for Housing
Studies also have noted the trend -- one that residents in some
neighborhoods are trying to buck.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our community is kind of the example of the mix of all of
America, and we'd like to keep it that way,'' said Fran Tobin, a
community activist who's fighting to save affordable housing on
Chicago's far North Side.

Tensions Rise Over Cuban Boy
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- With the Justice Department threatening to take Elian Gonzalez
from his Miami relatives, a crowd gathered outside the boy's Little Havana home
today, holding a vigil and ready to form a human chain if necessary. The risk of
a confrontation over the 6-year-old boy appeared to grow as the government and
the Miami relatives traded accusations. Attorney General Janet Reno has demanded
that the Miami relatives pursue any court appeals rapidly and promise to
surrender Elian for return to his father in Cuba if they lose. Today, the
relatives filed their latest appeal.

Oil Producers Meet in Vienna
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- OPEC oil ministers on Monday cited Iran as the one
hurdle to get over in order for them to reach an agreement about how much crude
oil to add to the global supplies. Iran accepts the need for OPEC to boost
output, the Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Namdar Zangeneh said, but the amount of
an increase favored by his country might not be enough to reduce petroleum
prices from nine-year highs. Iran, OPEC's second-largest producer, is known to
favor boosting output by about 1.2 million barrels a day -- an amount that
probably would do little to reduce world oil prices.

Putin Takes on New Role

   MOSCOW (AP) -- After solidifying his position as the new president of Russia,
Vladimir Putin admitted to voters Mondays that he had no swift solutions to
poverty and corruption that plague his nation. Putin ordered the government to
pay off wage debts to state workers, and said a first order of business after
his convincing victory in Sunday's election would be selecting a prime minister.
Putin has promised to protect democratic freedoms, but has yet to indicate how
he would carry the sprawling nation into the post-Boris Yeltsin era. Putin, 47,
was named acting president when Yeltsin resigned Dec. 31.

Washington tied up $7.6 million in new goods, U.N. figures showed today. The
figures also showed that most of the equipment that Washington released on

equipment. The United States has tied up over $1 billion worth of goods in the
U.N. sanctions committee arguing that it wants to make sure it cannot be used

<HEADLINE> Questions in Salvadoran Deaths  </HEADLINE>
By MARCOS ALEMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) -- A Jesuit-run university
formally asked prosecutors Monday to re-invesigate the murders of
six priests and two women in 1989, alleging that a former president
and other top officials were negligent in the deaths.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint by the Universidad CentroAmericana did not accuse
President Alfredo Cristiani of direct involvement in the slayings,
but said he and former Defense Minister Rafael Humberto Larios
shared guilt because they could have prevented the crime.
</P>
<P>
   Father Jose Maria Tojeira told a news conference that the school
is urging that officials bring charges against the men in
connections with the slayings, amongs the most notorious atrocities
in the country's 12-year civil war.
</P>
<P>
   The school's complaint did accuse five former army generals of
direct responsibility for the murders.
</P>
<P>
   Aides at Cristiani's office said the former president, who left
office in 1994, had no comment. Phone numbers for the retired
generals were not immediately available.
</P>
<P>
   The six priests, who worked at the university, allegedly had
been suspected of sympathy for the country's rebel movement.
</P>
<P>
   They, along with a housekeeper and her daughter, were rousted
from their beds at and shot by soldiers on Nov. 16, 1989, a U.S.
congressional investigation concluded.
</P>
<P>
   A colonel, two lieutenants, a second lieutenant and five other
soldiers were accused of the slayings, but only two were convicted.
Col. Guillermo Alfredo Benavides and Lt. Yusshy Mendoza were freed
in 1992 due to an amnesty law passed to accompany a peace treaty
ending the war.
</P>
<P>
   Tojeira said that if Salvadoran officials do not act on the
complaint, the university might file a similar action abroad --
possibly in Spain, where a court recently sought the extradition of
former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet for alleged crimes against
Spanish citizens.
</P>
<P>
   The Human Rights Commission of the Organization of American
States recently issued a report blaming the government for the
slaying of the priests and saying it had failed to adequately
investigate the incident.
</P>
<P>
   In January, President Francisco Flores -- a member of Cristiani's
party -- said he opposed reopening the case, saying it ''would be to
open the door on a conflict that we have left behind.''

<HEADLINE> Airport Security Co. Pleads Guilty  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- An airport security firm was sentenced Monday to
two years' probation and $110,000 in fines and restitution for
failing to do background checks and complete employment forms for
personnel at Miami International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Aviation Safeguards of Florida Inc. agreed to a plea bargain in
December. The company could have faced up to $500,000 in fines and
five years' probation if convicted.
</P>
<P>
   According to court records, Aviation Safeguards failed to
complete employment verifications, including criminal history
checks, at least 70 times in 1998, then lied about the lapses to
federal regulators.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, the employment applications and verifications
weren't completed until after employees had been given access to
secure airport areas.
</P>
<P>
   The charges stemmed from the actions of the company's former
general manager in Miami, Guillermo Blanco, who pleaded guilty last
year to 22 counts of giving false statements to the Federal
Aviation Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Aviation Safeguards provides security personnel, wheelchair
operators, luggage screeners and scanners to small airlines that do
not have their own.

<HEADLINE> Sabres 5, Hurricanes 1  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID DROSCHAK, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Miroslav Satan and Doug Gilmour each had a
goal and three assists as the surging Buffalo Sabres won their
fourth straight, beating the Carolina Hurricanes 5-1 Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Sabres moved past Montreal and into the eighth and final
playoff spot in the Eastern Conference with six games left, winning
only their 12 road game in 38 tries.
</P>
<P>
   Gilmour became the 20th NHL player to record 1,300 career points
with his third-period assist and he added Buffalo's final goal with
8:29 left. Gilmour's big night ran his point streak to seven games,
scoring in every game since being acquired from Chicago before the
trade deadline.
</P>
<P>
   The Hurricanes fell three points behind the Sabres and remained
in 10th position. The two teams meet again Friday night in Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   Carolina hit four posts, but could only manage a Gary Roberts
second-period goal against Dominik Hasek, who won his fourth
straight start.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts got the crowd of 15,395 into the game with his
game-tying goal, but Buffalo's Curtis Brown scored 17 seconds
later, picking up a rebound from a Satan blast and beating Arturs
Irbe.
</P>
<P>
   Satan then scored his team-leading 32nd goal late in the second
as he capitalized on a Roberts turnover in the Carolina end,
beating Irbe from the right circle.
</P>
<P>
   Satan set up Buffalo's fourth goal with 11:45 left, breaking in
on the right side and circling around the back of the net before
feeding Vladimir Tsyplakov for a one-timer from the slot.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo took a 1-0 lead midway through the first period on a
fluke goal. Jay McKee's rising shot from the point hit off the back
of Carolina defenseman Steve Halko and past Irbe.
</P>
<P>
   One day after firing 49 shots at the Islanders, Carolina
peppered Hasek with 13 in the first period, but hit a pair of posts
and couldn't beat the Czech goalie.
</P>
<P>
   The Sabres played without captain Michael Peca, who began
serving his two-game suspension for a forearm hit on Calgary's
Valeri Bure last Thursday night.

<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Jeff Lacy, who had to win in both the ring
and arbitration to get this far, took another step toward reaching
the Olympics on Monday at Exposition Hall.
</P>
<P>
   He scored a 9-0 decision over Alex James of Grenada in a
first-round match at 165 pounds at the Americas qualifying
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Lacy, of St. Petersburg, Fla., had won a title at the U.S.
Olympic trials. He then lost 12-9 to Arthur Palac at the box-offs,
then made the U.S. team by outpointing Palac, 10-9. Palac, of
Hamtramck, Mich., appealed to the American Arbitration Association,
but the appeal was rejected. If it had been upheld, Palac and Lacy
would have had to fight again to see who made the U.S. team.
</P>
<P>
   Lacy was not especially sharp Monday night, but said, ''I had to
figure this guy out. I wanted to take it round by round and come
out with the win.''
</P>
<P>
   Four of Lacy's nine points came in second round when he forced
James to take a standing 8-count. Lacy recorded four scoring blows
in the round.
</P>
<P>
   Marshal Martinez of Fontana, Calif., 132, and Jermain Taylor of
Little Rock, Ark., 156, the only U.S. boxers in action, also
advanced.
</P>
<P>
   There are 154 boxers from 23 in countries in North, South and
Central America and the Caribbean competing for 22 berths in the
Sydney Olympics in September. There also will be Americas
qualifying tournaments at Mexico City from April 17-22 and Buenos
Aires from May 23-28. Cuba, as the world's No. 1 team, is exempt
and assured of 12 boxers in the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez pounded Fabricio Nieva of Argentina with left hooks in
the last three rounds and won 14-2 at 132 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   After the first of the four 2-minute rounds, Martinez said, ''My
coach told me the left hook was open,'' said Martinez, who rocked
the taller Nieva several times with the punch, especially in the
final round when he outscored his opponent 7-0.
</P>
<P>
   Although Martinez looked poised, he admitted, ''I was nervous. I
don't want to go to Mexico, I want to home.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor forced Fritz Roberts of St. Vincent to take two standing
8-counts and stopped him in the second round.
</P>
<P>
   ''I could see he was kind of green,'' Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
   In another 132-pound bout, Darling Jimenez, of Yonkers, N.Y.,
boxing for his native Dominican Republic, outpointed Jewel Lewis of
Grenada 8-3.
</P>
<P>
   Jimenez is one of four naturalized U.S. citizens boxing for the
Dominican Republic. He failed to make the U.S. team.
</P>
<P>
   One of the other three, Jerson Ravelo of Newark, N.J.,
outpointed Gean Guimaraes of Brazil 9-2 at 165 pounds. Ravela was
beaten 18-8 in the U.S. trials quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
   First-round bouts also were held in the 112, 139 and 201-pound
classes Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the winners at 112 pounds were Omar Narvaez from
Argentina, and Carlos Valcarcel of Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   Narvaez, who outpointed Jose Navarro of Los Angeles, the U.S.
112-pound representative in the Pan American Games final, stopped
Ricardo Blackman of Barbados in the second round. Valacarcel, 1-1
in bouts with Navarro, knocked down Felipe Calvo of Costa Rica with
a right to the head and stopped him in the second round.
</P>
<P>
   The 22 qualifiers in this competition which concludes Saturday
will be the finalists in the 10 weight classes from 106 through 178
pounds and the winners at 201 pounds and super heavyweight. The
same format at Mexico City will produce 22 more qualifiers. The
winners of the 10 lower weight classes at Buenos Aires also will
qualify.

<HEADLINE> Devil Rays' Mecir Injured Warming Up  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Tampa Bay relief pitcher Jim Mecir is day to
day with a biceps strain, which occurred as he was set to enter
Monday night's game between the Devil Rays and the New York
Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   With two outs in the bottom of the sixth inning, Mecir departed
after one warmup pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ''He felt something in the bicep,'' Tampa Bay manager Larry
Rothschild said. ''It's not his elbow or shoulder, that's the good
news. But again, the bad news is he felt something. Well just
see.''
</P>
<P>
   Mecir is 1-1 with 2.25 ERA in seven games this spring. He
allowed two runs and six hits in eight innings.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know what happened ... it just feels tight,'' Mecir
said. ''It's just a muscle pull. That's all it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Mecir missed most of last season after fracturing his right
elbow during batting practice on May 12. He underwent surgery the
following day by Dr. James Andrews in Birmingham Ala.

<HEADLINE> Alleged Castle Thief Extradited  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A man wanted in France for allegedly stealing
nine castles was extradited Monday to face charges of fraud and
forgery.
</P>
<P>
   Magistrate Judge Douglas Eaton had ordered Jean-Paul Renoir, 53,
extradited to France on Feb. 25, 1998, but an extradition treaty
between the two nations also required approval from the U.S.
Department of State.
</P>
<P>
   That approval came on March 8, authorizing U.S. marshals to
deliver Renoir to French authorities for extradition.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Stillman, a lawyer for Renoir, said the defendant gave
up his appeals and decided to go to France because ''he needed to
put this behind him.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The simple fact is that he's totally innocent of any of these
matters,'' he said. ''He felt the best thing to do was to go to
France.''
</P>
<P>
   In France, the New York resident and his wife, Kiiko Nakahara,
are accused of fraud and forgery for allegedly assuming ownership
of nine chateaus worth an estimated $22.45 million.
</P>
<P>
   Nakahara, who is already in France, has been under court order
to remain there. Her father, Hideki Yokoi, sued the couple in 1994
in state Supreme Court in Manhattan for allegedly stealing his
share of the Empire State Building. Yokoi bought part of the
building in 1991 for $40 million.
</P>
<P>
   Stillman said all of the disputes between the wife and her
family have been settled.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- The Eckerd Corp. drug store chain is
recalling store-brand antacid tablets from all stores nationwide
after an Arlington woman reported finding a small blade imbedded in
a pill.
</P>
<P>
   ''It looks like a small piece of razor or an Exacto knife,''
Janette Hinkle told Dallas-Fort Worth television station KTVT.
''It's metal, very thin and very sharp.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clearwater, Fla.-based chain is investigating how the blade
got into a package bought Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The safety and good health of our customers is our primary
concern,'' company officials said in a statement Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Pending our complete and thorough review of this matter, our
quality assurance team will diligently investigate both internally
and with the manufacturer.''
</P>
<P>
   The recall affects antacid pills in 150-tablet bottles with lot
number 1584-680.

<HEADLINE> Japan Stocks Fall  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- The Tokyo Stock Exchange's main index fell Tuesday
morning on profit-taking following sharp gains the previous day.
The dollar was lower against the yen.
</P>
<P>
   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 209.57 points,
or 1.03 percent, to 20,071.46 at the end of the morning session. On
Monday, the average closed up 322.95 points, or 1.61 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar bought 106.58 yen in late morning, down 0.32 yen from
late Monday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level of
106.87 yen.
</P>
<P>
   On the stock market, the Nikkei index lost as investors locked
in profits after Monday's sharp gains.
</P>
<P>
   ''Profit-taking was seen among lower-priced domestic shares that
rallied Monday,'' said Kunihiro Hatae, general manager at Tokyo
Securities Co.
</P>
<P>
   However, shares in Mitsubishi Motors rose after the Japanese
automaker and DaimlerChrysler AG announced Monday that the German
automaker will take a 34 percent stake in Mitsubishi.
</P>
<P>
   In currency dealings, the dollar slipped against the yen,
affected by the yen's relative strength against the euro.
</P>
<P>
   The euro's slide against the yen came after Deutsche Bundesbank
President Ernst Welteke said he didn't see any reason to raise
European interest rates now.
</P>
<P>
   The euro was traded at 103.02 yen, down from 104.35 yen late
Monday in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was up 0.32 points to 1,654,15 points. The TOPIX
closed up 13.32 points, or 0.81 percent, the day before.
</P>
<P>
   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond was
unquoted in late morning. On Monday, it settled at 1.8950 percent
and its price stood at 100.04.

<HEADLINE> Monday's Spring Training Roundup  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   With most teams season openers just a week away,
managers put
their pitching rotations in order.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kevin Brown, an 18-game winner last year, will pitch the Los
Angeles Dodgers' season opener in Montreal next Monday night
against Dustin Hermanson, with Chan Ho Park and Orel Hershiser
starting the second and third games.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Fernandez will start Florida's season opener against San
Francisco on Monday, and Ryan Dempster, Vladimir Nunez, Jesus
Sanchez and Brad Penny will follow Fernandez in the rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Darryl Kile, acquired from Colorado as part of an offseason
pitching makeover, will start St. Louis' opener Monday against the
Cubs, Chicago's first game back following the two-game series this
week against the New York Mets in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   Garret Stephenson, who takes the place in the Cardinals'
rotation that opened when Kent Bottenfield was dealt to Anaheim for
Jim Edmonds, allowed two runs and four hits in five innings Monday
during a 3-3, seven-inning tie against Montreal in Jupiter, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the regular season, if he throws 80 pitches the way he did
today, that's the difference between going five or six innings or
pitching into the seventh or eighth inning,'' Cardinals manager
Tony La Russa said.
</P>
<P>
   At Tokorozawa, Japan, Rickey Henderson went 3-for-4 as the Mets
beat the Seibu Lions 8-1.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson's name has come up in trade talks with the Detroit
Tigers involving Bobby Higginson. Baseball's career steals leader
created a commotion this spring by asking for a deal, but nothing
has happened so far.
</P>
<P>
   Against Seibu, Henderson scored two runs and drove in one. He
left after five innings with the Mets ahead 5-0.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's the way it is with baseball,'' teammate Mike Piazza
said. ''You have to put the distractions behind you.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Tokyo Dome, Sammy Sosa went 0-for-4 as the Chicago Cubs
lost to the Tokyo Yomiuri Giants 6-0.
</P>
<P>
   ''The pitching was everything. They've got good pitching,'' Sosa
said. ''All of them were impressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Jeff Cirillo, expected to replace Dante Bichette as
Colorado's cleanup hitter, aggravated a strained right quadriceps
Monday while hitting eight times in a minor league game.
</P>
<P>
   ''The leg's not ready,'' Cirillo said. ''There's no pain, but
there's definitely something in there. I almost regret doing this
today. ... I do regret doing it. After my first at-bat, I was like,
'This is probably not a smart idea.' That's where I'm stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   In other games:
Tigers 15, Royals 7:
</P>

<HEADLINE> Notre Dame Using NIT To Prove Point  </HEADLINE>
By DENNIS WASZAK Jr., AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Notre Dame is using its NIT run to send a
message to the NCAA selection committee: The Irish should have been
one of the tournament's 64 teams.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've talked about proving them wrong since the beginning of
this tournament,'' Irish coach Matt Doherty said Monday during a
luncheon introducing the coaches of the NIT semifinalists.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's been part of our mission -- to prove to the NCAA
committee that they made a mistake. I tell the team to look at
Wisconsin (in the NCAA tournament). They have 13 losses. That could
have been us.''
</P>
<P>
   Notre Dame (21-14) will play Penn State (18-15) in the second
semifinal Tuesday night at Madison Square Garden. In the first
game, North Carolina State (20-12) will face Wake Forest (20-14).
The championship is Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''These four teams could be in that other tournament, but I, uh,
forget the name of it,'' Doherty said.
</P>
<P>
   Doherty expressed his frustration when Notre Dame was not
selected to participate in the NCAA's field of 64, but he refused
to allow his team to dwell on it. Now, Notre Dame is two wins from
the NIT championship.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm grateful to the NIT because I think we should be playing
for some kind of championship,'' Doherty said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yes, we were disappointed at not making the NCAAs, and that's
no slight to the NIT. There were some teams this year that were
very disappointed, and couldn't overcome that.''
</P>
<P>
   Notre Dame beat Michigan, Xavier and Brigham Young to join
Louisville (1985), St. John's ('89) and Minnesota ('93) as schools
who have played in the semifinals of both the preseason and
postseason NITs. The Irish lost to Arizona in the semifinals in
November.
</P>
<P>
   ''We kind of have the same itinerary that we've kept from the
preseason NIT and just changed the dates and the times,'' Doherty
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Irish are led by 6-foot-9 sophomore Troy Murphy, the Big
East player of the year and the only AP first-team All-America
selection still playing.
</P>
<P>
   ''Troy Murphy is an outstanding player, who has a number of good
players to complement him,'' Penn State coach Jerry Dunn said.
''They're a very good team in what is probably one of the strongest
fields ever in the NIT.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett Stephens returned from a career-threatening knee injury
in the 1998 NIT semifinals against Georgia to lead the Nittany
Lions in scoring (18.7 points) and rebounding (10.7). Penn State,
which hasn't played Notre Dame since beating the Irish in the 1954
NCAA tournament, is also led by brothers Joe and Jon Crispin.
</P>
<P>
   In the other semifinal, ACC rivals Wake Forest and N.C. State
play for the third time this season. The teams have never met in
the postseason, however, other than the ACC tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not an advantage for either team,'' N.C. State coach Herb
Sendek said. ''They know us well, and obviously, we know them very
well. It's actually a challenge for both of our teams.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wolfpack, in their first NIT semifinal since 1978, beat the
Deamon Deacons 76-56 in Raleigh, N.C., in January. A month later,
Wake Forest routed N.C. State 71-53 in Winston Salem, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   ''His team was a better team the first time around,'' Wake
Forest coach Dave Odom said. ''They played much better defense and
our offense was in a state of flux. When we played in Winston
Salem, our team had gotten a lot better.''
</P>
<P>
   N.C. State is led by guard Anthony Grundy, forward Kenny Inge,
and forward Damien Wilkins. Wilkins, a 6-6 freshman, is the son of
former New York Knicks player Gerald Wilkins, and the nephew of
former NBA All-Star Dominique Wilkins.
</P>
<P>
   ''Damien has become a great player for us despite the
expectations others put on him,'' Sendek said.
</P>
<P>
   Wake Forest has been led by forward Darius Songaila and guard
Robert O'Kelley.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no shame in playing basketball in the last week of
March,'' Odom said. ''There is no shame in playing in New York, and
there's no shame in playing at Madison Square Garden. There's
nothing but excitement, pride and joy for us.''
</P>
<P>
   All four coaches said they expect closely played games, but
added that a number of factors will decide which team leaves the
Big Apple with its first NIT title.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a fine line between the competition in college
basketball today,'' Doherty said. ''It's all about execution,
making shots, biorhythms and the stars and the moon being in the
right place that day.''

<HEADLINE> Chemical Plant Explosion Injures 52  </HEADLINE>
By MEGAN K. STACK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Texas (AP) -- An explosion Monday rocked a Phillips
Petroleum chemical plant near the Houston Ship Channel, killing one
worker and injuring at least 52 people.
</P>
<P>
   The blast sparked a fire that sent thick smoke over the area.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was in the main shop area when I heard a loud explosion,''
said Tim Williams, a plant worker who estimated he was more than
200 yards from the 1:25 p.m. explosion. ''My ears hurt, and I took
off running. I looked back and saw flames, and kept going.''
</P>
<P>
   Search crews discovered the body of a missing employee some five
hours after the early afternoon blast. Fifty-two people were taken
to hospitals with injuries that included burns, smoke inhalation
and anxiety-related disorders.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman Norm Berkley said the plant employs roughly 850
people, and said about 600 would have been there at the time of the
blast.
</P>
<P>
   Workers in neighboring plants and residents in the area were
urged to remain indoors while schoolchildren were kept inside after
the bell rang. Smoke continued to rise two hours after the blast,
and was clearly was visible across Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The Phillips complex was the site of a 1989 series of explosions
and fires in a polyethylene reactor that killed 23 and injured 130.
</P>
<P>
   Last June, two people were killed and four were injured in an
explosion at the complex. Afterward, federal officials fined
Phillips $204,000 for 13 alleged safety violations.

<HEADLINE> Spurs 90, Sonics 82  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Tim Duncan scored 30 points and David Robinson
added 23 points as the San Antonio Spurs used a 17-3 fourth quarter
run to beat the Seattle SuperSonics 90-82 on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs twin towers dominated inside with Duncan grabbing 18
rebounds and Robinson 16 to go along with four blocked shots.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics led 75-71 when the Spurs held Seattle to three
baskets over the final eight minutes. The Sonics lost their fourth
straight home game and slipped into eighth place in the Western
Conference playoff race.
</P>
<P>
   Sean Elliott, playing his seventh game since being activated
after a kidney transplant, scored 10 points, including a key
3-pointer for an 80-76 lead with 5:30 left.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Payton and Vin Baker led the Sonics with 21 points apiece.
Baker appeared to aggravate his left hamstring injury when he fell
with 2:30 left in the game. He did not return.
</P>
<P>
   For the third time in their last four games, the Sonics led in
the fourth quarter but could not hang on.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs went on an 11-1 run for an 82-76 advantage. Duncan had
four points, Antonio Daniels four and Elliott hit a 3-pointer.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle led 69-68 when Baker scored on an offensive rebound and
Samaki Walker was assessed a technical foul for shoving Jelani
McCoy. Payton's free throw gave Seattle a 72-68 lead with 8:45
left.
</P>
<P>
   Like the other three meetings between the teams, it was close
most of the game. The series is tied at two wins apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Payton scored nine points in the third quarter as the Sonics
were up 66-61 after three periods.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics opened the third quarter with a 7-0 run on Greg
Foster's basket, a 3-point shot by Brent Barry and Baker's putback
basket for 51-42 advantage with 10:24 left in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Foster replaced the injured Grant and gave the Sonics a lift in
the first half with eight points, six rebounds and three assists.
</P>
<P>
   Payton's runner with 3.1 seconds in the half gave the Sonics a
44-42 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Horace Grant did not dress because of a contusion to the
left shoulder during practice Monday. ... Ruben Patterson started
and played the first six minutes but saw limited minutes because of
his sore Achilles tendons. ... Elliott played a season high in
minutes -- 26 -- as he continued his comeback after kidney surgery on
August 16.

   TEANECK, N.J. (AP) -- Reggie Harris, a reporter and anchor at
WWOR-TV, died Monday while exercising at home. He was 46.
</P>
<P>
   Harris died of an apparent heart attack a few hours before he
was to report to work for his 3:30 p.m. shift at the television
station, known in the New York area as Channel 9.
</P>
<P>
   He was working out on an aerobics machine when he collapsed,
said his wife, Diane. Harris had an irregular heartbeat but no
other known heart disease, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Harris, who had won six Emmy Awards in his career, had been a
lead reporter and anchor at Secaucus-based WWOR-TV since January
1997, and before that a reporter for 10 years at WCBS-TV in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   WWOR-TV news director Will Wright said Harris was known for
relentlessly pursuing a story up until the minute he was scheduled
to deliver a nightly newscast, searching for new information or
leads.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was always breathless in his delivery. He would never let a
story stand still,'' Wright said. ''Sometimes it would drive us
crazy, because we'd be up to the countdown and he'd be out
digging.''
</P>
<P>
   Channel 9 anchor Ernie Anastos called Harris a ''true
professional.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He was the kind of guy that felt a sense of purpose about what
he was doing. He will be sorely missed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Harris was involved in a literacy program in schools throughout
the New York metropolitan area, Wright said.
</P>
<P>
   A native of St. Petersburg, Fla., Harris graduated from Florida
State University and went on to become a reporter in Dallas before
coming to WCBS in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife; a daughter, 19-year-old Rachel
Harris; and a son, 16-year-old Darren.
</P>
<P>
   Funeral plans have not yet been made.

<HEADLINE> Madagascar Aid Turns to Repairs  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANTANANARIVO, Madagascar (AP) -- Most flood victims in Madagascar
are out of immediate danger and relief efforts now will focus on
repairing damaged infrastructure and replanting ruined crops, aid
workers said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the spread of year-long cholera epidemic has slowed
with drier weather, according to the Health Ministry. It reported
70 deaths in the past week, half the levels of previous weeks.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,500 people have died and 26,000 fallen ill since the
start of the epidemic a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. World Food Program Representative Salha Haladou said his
organization was beginning a four- to six-month program to restore
roads, dams, canals and buildings destroyed in the wake of two
cyclones that swept over the island in mid-February and early
March.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are looking at the midterm now, helping people in the most
affected areas to rehabilitate their infrastructure,'' Haladou
said.
</P>
<P>
   About 130 people died and more than 40,000 lost their homes; 70
to 80 percent of crops were lost in the worst-hit areas.
</P>
<P>
   The storms damaged many of the main roads and bridges along the
east coast of this Indian Ocean island nation, located off
southeast Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The same storms also hit Mozambique on the African mainland,
causing greater loss of life and destruction.
</P>
<P>
   A report from the U.S. Agency for International Development said
there were no life-threatening situations in the flood-damaged
areas, but food, medicines and water purification supplies will be
needed in coming weeks.

<HEADLINE> Russian Czar's Dagger Stolen  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- A jewel-encrusted dagger and sheath
that belonged to Czar Alexander III of Russia disappeared Sunday
from an exhibit on the Queen Mary, a spokeswoman for the historic
ocean liner-turned-hotel said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The 19th-century dagger, worth an estimated $50,000, is about 11
inches long with a curved steel blade and a gold hilt set with
emerald and turquoise.
</P>
<P>
   It was part of an exhibit on loan from the Russian Museum of
Ethnography in St. Petersburg consisting of presents given to the
last czars of imperial Russia. Alexander III received the dagger in
1883 as a gift from the Emir of Bukhara, in the mountains northeast
of Iran and Iraq, an area now called Uzbekistan.
</P>
<P>
   A security guard discovered the dagger was missing from its
Plexiglas case Sunday afternoon, said Lovetta Kramer, Queen Mary
marketing vice president.
</P>
<P>
   The case had a security camera trained on it, but because of
security concerns, Kramer refused to say how the dagger was
removed. Police Officer David Marander said detectives are
reviewing videotape. He had no other information on the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the exhibit remains open through April 22, and an
additional guard had been added, Kramer said.
</P>
<P>
   Queen Mary officials are offering a $10,000 reward for return of
the dagger and sheath in good condition.

<HEADLINE> Elian Thinks Mom Is Still Alive  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER, AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- As the political storm over his future kept
swirling, Elian Gonzalez said in his first lengthy interview that
he doesn't really believe his mother died when the boat carrying
them to Florida sank.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-year-old Cuban boy spoke with Diane Sawyer in a segment
shown on ABC's ''Good Morning America'' Monday, raising questions
about the propriety of interviewing someone so young. The Cuban
government sent a letter of protest to ABC on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   He was made available by his Miami relatives as they run short
of legal options to avoid sending him back to his father in Cuba.
They are appealing a federal judge's ruling affirming the
government decision to send him home.
</P>
<P>
   Sawyer brought along a child psychiatrist who speaks Spanish for
the interview, and Elian's cousin also translated.
</P>
<P>
   Elian drew crayon pictures of the voyage in which his mother and
10 other people drowned. He first drew a wavy line representing
waves, then a leaping dolphin -- he has told people that dolphins
protected him from sharks and boosted him up when he slipped down
into the water from an inner tube.
</P>
<P>
   He drew himself as a stick figure on the inner tube, and then
sketched a boat with people inside. He told of the boat having
engine trouble and slowly sinking, and of attempts to bail it out.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what happened to the boat, he said softly: ''Water came
in.''
</P>
<P>
   He drew the waves higher and higher, covering the boat.
</P>
<P>
   Elian insisted his mother survived.
</P>
<P>
   ''My mother is not in heaven, not lost,'' he said in Spanish
through his cousin Marisleysis Gonzalez. ''She must have been
picked up here in Miami somewhere. She must have lost her memory,
and just doesn't know I'm here.''
</P>
<P>
   During his hours floating alone in the inner tube, Elian said he
was praying for survival. Marisleysis translated the prayer:
''Guardian angel, sweet companion, don't leave my side, day or
night, for if you do, I will be lost.''
</P>
<P>
   Sawyer said ABC thought long and hard about how to do the
interview. She said by ABC's calculation, there have been 11,984
articles written about the case and ''not one of us has sat down
and looked into his eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Sawyer did that, leaning next to Elian as he made his drawings
and allowing him to shoot Silly String into her hair. She called
him bubbly, very bright and ''infinitely curious.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all journalists believe it is proper to interview young
children. NBC's competing ''Today'' show, for example, did not
pursue an interview with Elian because it did not believe it was
appropriate to talk to a 6-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   Several networks, including NBC, requested interviews with
Elian, said Armando Gutierrez, spokesman for Elian's Miami
relatives. He said he was not sure whether NBC's request was
specifically from ''Today.''
</P>
<P>
   The family ''wanted to do it right'' and have a child
psychologist present for the interview, Gutierrez said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every channel wanted him,'' he said, ''so we didn't see
anything wrong with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Steele, director of the ethics program at the Poynter
Institute, a journalism education center, said he believed Elian
should not have been interviewed on TV, given his age and the
recent experiences of losing his mother and becoming a subject of a
political battle.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think it's fair to him to once more shine the bright
light of scrutiny on him with this type of interview,'' Steele
said. ''I don't think what he might offer, given his age, given his
vulnerability, given his trauma, has enough benefit to outweigh the
potential significant harm in revictimization.''
</P>
<P>
   ABC News President David Westin said the network understood the
need to handle the interview with sensitivity. ''What we put on the
air was very tasteful, very appropriate, very low-key, nonintrusive
to Elian,'' Westin said.
</P>
<P>
   He said it was important to talk to Elian and not just have his
thought characterized by others. He said the story gives a sense of
Elian's surroundings, his state of mind and what he's like, ''which
I think is legitimate and important.''
</P>
<P>
   In a speech Sunday in Havana, Cuban President Fidel Castro said
subjecting Elian to the interview was ''monstrous and sickening.''
</P>
<P>
   ''You cannot do this without the authorization of the father,''
Castro said. ''I sincerely think that this boy is at risk in the
hands of desperate people and the government of the United States
should not be running this risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Castro said Monday that Ricardo Alarcon, president of Cuba's
National Assembly, had sent a letter to ABC protesting that Elian's
father was not consulted for the interview.
</P>
<P>
   The network received the letter late Monday, said ABC
spokeswoman Eileen Murphy. She said the network is considering the
complaints and may address them in an upcoming program. ABC is to
air two more segments of the interview over the next two days.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy said Sawyer's meeting with Elian wasn't an interview.
Sawyer ''was never alone with Elian, it wasn't a one-on-one. It was
a supervised visit,'' Murphy said. ''We did have the permission of
his custodial guardian and his attorney, which is what we thought
was necessary.''

<HEADLINE> Violence Mars Haitian Protests  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL NORTON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) -- Four people, including a
neighborhood voting official, were killed Monday during violent
demonstrations to demand the resignation of Haiti's electoral
council, which is embroiled in a controversy over upcoming
elections.
</P>
<P>
   Groups of demonstrators blocked traffic with flaming tire
barricades on roads leading into Port-au-Prince, the capital, and
at city intersections. Some threw rocks at passing vehicles. Police
intervened to remove the tires.
</P>
<P>
   The fatalities occurred along the city's seaside boulevard, but
the circumstances were unclear. In the voting official's death,
witnesses initially said he was attacked by machete-wielding
protesters. Others gave conflicting versions of what happened.
</P>
<P>
   Police didn't intervene in the seaside protest and had no
immediate comment.
</P>
<P>
   Haiti's electoral process has been marred by violence since
President Rene Preval dissolved Parliament in January 1999,
appointed a new premier and provisional electoral council by decree
and called for elections.
</P>
<P>
   More than 50 violent election-related incidents have been
recorded since October, according to an Organization of American
States mission.
</P>
<P>
   Two rounds of elections for local and legislative offices have
been postponed twice because of organizational problems.
</P>
<P>
   The electoral council has rescheduled voting for April 9 and May
21, but Preval is contesting the council's authority, charging the
dates were invalid since he had not published them in an executive
order. It is uncertain when balloting will be held.
</P>
<P>
   Most opposition politicians have accused Preval of wanting to
govern without a legislative check to his power until presidential
elections in December, when his mentor and predecessor, former
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, will run for a second term.

<HEADLINE> Connecticut 86, LSU 71  </HEADLINE>
By HANK KURZ Jr., AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- Geno Auriemma will have no trouble
convincing his top-ranked Connecticut Huskies that winning the
national championship won't be a snap.
</P>
<P>
   LSU did it for him.
</P>
<P>
   The Lady Tigers gave Connecticut its first scare of the NCAA
tournament, keeping it close for much of the game before the
Huskies pulled away for an 86-71 victory Monday night in the East
Regional final.
</P>
<P>
   ''We really had to buckle down in the second half to make sure
we were going to win,'' said All-American Shea Ralph, who had 15
points for the Huskies (34-1).
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut, ranked No. 1 all season, will play Penn State on
Friday in the national semifinals. Penn State beat Louisiana Tech
86-65 in the Midwest Regional final.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies had a 31.6-point average victory margin this season,
and won their first three NCAA tournament games by a total of 131
points.
</P>
<P>
   But some of the Huskies' swagger might have been diminished by
the third-seeded Lady Tigers, who shot 73.9 percent in the first
half and were down only 46-41 at the break
</P>
<P>
   ''There are no easy games to go to the Final Four,'' Auriemma
said. ''I couldn't believe it. It's just amazing how hard you have
to work to go to the Final Four.''
</P>
<P>
   April Brown had 18 of her 25 points by halftime for LSU (25-7),
making only its second appearance in the final eight.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was kind of frustrating knowing that we were shooting
pretty good and couldn't find a way to get that lead,'' Brown said.
''At halftime, we knew it came down to the defensive end.''
</P>
<P>
   UConn shot 56.9 percent, but never led by more than 17.
</P>
<P>
   All-American Svetlana Abrosimova led the Huskies with 25 points
and was selected the regional's most valuable player. Sue Bird
added 16.
</P>
<P>
   ''That last minute, I think it was starting to hit us that we
were going to win and we were actually going to the Final Four,''
Ralph said. ''It felt wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies used intense fullcourt pressure to get off to a
quick start against the Lady Tigers. A 9-2 run gave UConn a 19-8
lead.
</P>
<P>
   But the Lady Tigers' shooting, especially that of Brown, kept
them close. Brown was 7-for-8 from the field in the half and hit
all four of her 3-point shots, a big surprise after she shot
10-for-33 in her first 31 games.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not your size, it's what's in your heart that matters,''
Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   UConn is headed to the Final Four for the fourth time in nine
years. Connecticut lost to Virginia in the national semifinals in
1991, won the 1995 title at 35-0 and lost to Tennessee in the
semifinals the following year.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a great feeling. I just can't describe it,'' Abrosimova
said.
</P>
<P>
   Marie Ferdinand added 17 points for LSU, which shot 51.8
percent. Katrina Hibbert and DeTrina White added 13 points each.
</P>
<P>
   The Lady Tigers used the dazzling ball-handling of Ferdinand to
minimize the Huskies' signature press. LSU made eight of its first
nine shots and 16 of its first 20.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were knocking lights out, but they were hitting threes and
we were hitting twos,'' LSU coach Sue Gunter said of the halftime
deficit. ''Going in at halftime down by five, I felt we were in
pretty good shape considering what had happened.''
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies wore down the Lady Tigers in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we finally ran out of gas,'' Gunter said.
</P>
<P>
   UConn led 60-52 after Tamika Williams' putback with 12:02 left
and scored 15 of the next 21 points. Ralph had seven points in the
run, which ended with her 3-pointer from the corner that gave the
Huskies their biggest lead at 75-58.

<HEADLINE> Flyers Get New Captain  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The Philadelphia Flyers replaced Eric
Lindros as captain Monday, denying the move had anything to do with
his criticism of the team in treating his latest concussion.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Desjardins will succeed Lindros, who had been captain since
1994. The Flyers say the move is permanent.
</P>
<P>
   ''The group of players we have playing felt they needed a
captain,'' Flyers president and general manager Bob Clarke said.
''It has nothing to do with Lindros.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's not here, he's not playing. We're trying to prepare to be
the best team we can in the playoffs and our team felt it needed a
captain.''
</P>
<P>
   Lindros is expected to miss the rest of the regular season and
the first round of the playoffs. The star center was injured March
4, the fourth concussion of his career.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's fair to say when a guy like Lindros comes out and
criticizes the doctors and trainers, he's thinking of himself and
not the team,'' Clarke said. ''We're trying to do what's right for
the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Lindros, rehabilitating in Toronto, issued a statement Monday
night in which he wished Desjardins well.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a role I took very seriously. I put a lot of effort
into supporting teammates in decisions of management. It was a role
I felt I was honored to have and wished to continue,'' Lindros
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd like to wish our new captain Rico (Desjardins) the best
and look forward of course to the day when I am healthy and will
come back to contribute to our team's upcoming challenge of this
year's playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Clarke had said the team would not appoint an interim
captain in the absence of Lindros. He is sidelined four to six
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Several veteran players met with Clarke on Monday and suggested
it would be a good idea to have a captain in place with the Stanley
Cup playoffs starting in about two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Desjardins is the 12th captain in the team's 33-year history and
only the second defenseman to hold the post.
</P>
<P>
   He, Mark Recchi and John LeClair had been serving as alternate
captains. Recchi and LeClair endorsed Desjardins. Interim coach
Craig Ramsay also said Desjardins was the best candidate for the
position.
</P>
<P>
   '''Rammer' (Ramsay) and I had talked about it the last few days
and thought that there had been enough distractions around here,''
Clarke said after Monday's practice. ''We thought it would be
better to leave things the way they were.''
</P>
<P>
   Desjardins, 30, has been a Flyer since February 1995, when he
was acquired in a trade along with LeClair from Montreal for
Recchi. In career scoring by a Flyers' defenseman, Desjardins is
second only to Mark Howe.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's an ideal candidate to be a captain,'' Ramsay said. ''He's
a leader on the ice, a top quality person. He seemed like a natural
selection.''
</P>
<P>
   Desjardins said the team needed a change.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a great opportunity for me, the first time I'll be a
captain in this league,'' he said. ''When you're picked to be a
captain, you think of all the responsibilities. I think I'll be up
to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Veteran players wanted to put more emphasis on the appointment
of Desjardins than the demotion of Lindros.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's a great honor,'' LeClair said. ''He's
well-respected in this room and he's a leader of the guys we have
in here right now.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He's been a great leader of this team for a long time,'' Keith
Jones said. ''There was no one here more deserving. He leads by
example, knows the right time to say something. We wanted to make
sure we were established in our leadership roles.''

<HEADLINE> Author of 'The Joy of Sex' Dies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- British author Alex Comfort, who gained
international fame for his best selling ''The Joy of Sex,'' has
died. He was 80.
</P>
<P>
   Comfort, who was also a poet and nuclear disarmament campaigner,
died Sunday night in Oxfordshire. The cause of death wasn't
immediately available. He had suffered a series of strokes in the
past nine years and was being cared for at a nursing home.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Joy of Sex'', published in 1972, sold 12 million copies
worldwide and was translated into two dozens languages. Billed as
the ''gourmet guide to lovemaking,'' it contained text and
illustrations of love making.
</P>
<P>
   The book gained Comfort a reputation -- unfairly in the view of
his supporters -- as an advocate of promiscuity.
</P>
<P>
   Comfort, who frequently said he was irritated that he was always
remembered for the sex manual rather than his other extensive work,
nevertheless acknowledged that it was pioneering.
</P>
<P>
   ''Before my book, writing about sex gave the impression of being
written by non-playing coaches,'' he once said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Joy of Sex'' was one of 50 books written by Comfort. He
also produced novels, poetry, criticism, scientific textbooks and
books on oriental philosophy. It was followed in 1974 by ''More Joy
of Sex'' and ''The New Joy of Sex'' in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   He was a leading anarchist, pacifist and a member of the
Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and was a conscientious objector
during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, he moved to the United States, lecturing at the
Department of Psychiatry at Stanford University from 1974-1983.
From 1980-1991 he was a professor at the Neuropsychiatric Institute
at the University of California.
</P>
<P>
   Comfort's first marriage ended in divorce. His second wife, Jane
Henderson, died in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by a son from his first marriage and three
grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   There were no immediate details of funeral arrangements.

<HEADLINE> Govt. Eyes Elian Parole Revocation  </HEADLINE>
By MILDRADE CHERFILS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- The federal government said Monday night it would
revoke Elian Gonzalez's permission to remain in the United States
by Thursday unless his Miami relatives agree to surrender the boy
if they lose their court fight to keep him in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ''Without a specific written commitment ... we have no choice
but to move forward with the termination of Elian's parole as of
Thursday, March 30, 2000, at 9:00 a.m,'' the Immigration and
Naturalization Service said in a letter to the attorneys
representing the relatives.
</P>
<P>
   The agency said the relatives have failed to make that
commitment, which is required under federal law as a condition of
Elian's parole, which allowed the 6-year-old Cuban boy to remain in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials said they called the relatives to a meeting
Tuesday morning to discuss the ramifications of the termination and
an orderly return of the boy to his father in Cuba. The agency said
it was unnecessary to bring the boy but that Lazaro Gonzalez, the
boy's great-uncle, should attend.
</P>
<P>
   There was no reaction from Elian's Miami relatives or from the
crowd of about 50 people gathered outside the boy's Little Havana
home. A family spokesman said lawyers were discussing the letter,
and they could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Linda Osberg-Braun, an attorney for Elian's Miami
relatives, insisted the family has complied with the government's
demands.
</P>
<P>
   ''In light of our cooperation, we request that your officials
cease their constant threats to revoke Elian's parole,'' the
attorneys wrote in a letter to Attorney General Janet Reno.
</P>
<P>
   Elian has been at the center of an international tug-of-war
since late November, when he was rescued by fishermen who found him
lashed to an innertube bobbing off the Florida coast. His mother
and 10 others perished when their boat sank during the journey from
Cuba to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's Miami relatives say they can give him a better life than
he would have in communist Cuba. They Justice Department, however,
says he belongs with his father.
</P>
<P>
   Reno has demanded that the relatives pursue any court appeals
rapidly and promise to surrender Elian for return to his father in
Cuba if they lose.
</P>
<P>
   An appellate judge on Monday granted requests by the relatives
and the Justice Department for an expedited appeal, giving the
relatives' attorneys several days more to prepare their arguments
than the government would have preferred.
</P>
<P>
   But the relatives had not addressed the government's other
demand.
</P>
<P>
   ''That being so, the INS is under no obligation to maintain the
current arrangement,'' the government wrote in response, referring
to the deal giving Elian's great-uncle custody in the meantime.
</P>
<P>
   The government has made it clear it would not want to do
anything to traumatize the boy or provoke Miami's large Cuban
community.
</P>
<P>
   A small group had spilled into the streets outside the
relatives' home earlier Monday, waving a large Cuban flag but did
not block traffic. Someone put a 15-foot banner in front of the
house with a drawing of Elian and a message: ''I just want to live
in freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the protesters responded to a call by the Democracy
Movement, an anti-Castro group, to be prepared to form a human
chain around the home if the government tried to remove the child
and send him back to his father.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are a lot of people who aren't willing to kill but are
willing to die only for the child's rights,'' said Ramon Saul
Sanchez, head of the Democracy Movement.
</P>
<P>
   In an apparent effort to increase American support for their
battle to keep Elian, the child's relatives last week allowed ABC's
Diane Sawyer to spend two days with Elian. The result was his first
extended interview. The first of three segments aired Monday on
''Good Morning America.''
</P>
<P>
   In the segment broadcast Monday, Elian was not asked whether he
wants to return to Cuba. He described how the boat that was
bringing him and his mother from Cuba sank, and he said he doesn't
believe his mother is dead.
</P>
<P>
   Elian drew crayon pictures of the voyage in which his mother and
10 other people drowned. He was found clinging to an inner tube on
Thanksgiving and placed with his relatives in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ''My mother is not in heaven, not lost,'' he said in Spanish
through his cousin Marisleysis Gonzalez. ''She must have been
picked up here in Miami somewhere. She must have lost her memory,
and just doesn't know I'm here.''
</P>
<P>
   Marisleysis Gonzalez gently reminded him that he knows what
really happened to his mother, and he continued gazing downward.
</P>
<P>
   Elian remained home from school Monday, and family spokesman
Armando Gutierrez said he won't return out of fears that Cuba might
try to force him back to the communist island. On Monday, Castro
mocked Cuban exiles who said they feared he would launch an armed
raid to repatriate the boy.
</P>
<P>
   Teacher Obdulia Copa left the boy's home at the end of the
school day and confirmed that she will be teaching the child at
home for the rest of the week and possibly until the custody
dispute is resolved.
</P>
<P>
   The family wants the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in
Atlanta to overturn a federal judge's ruling last week affirming
the Immigration and Naturalization Service's decision to return
Elian to Cuba. The family asked that the case get a speeded-up
handling.
</P>
<P>
   The court responded by asking for the family to file briefs by
April 10 and for the government to respond by April 24. Any
response to the government by Elian's relatives must be filed by
May 1. The court will not grant any extensions, said Robert Phelps,
chief deputy clerk. Oral arguments in Atlanta are set for the week
of May 8.
</P>
<P>
   In a rare move, the family allowed a few reporters inside the
house to show them an image that had appeared in an oval mirror.
Tears flowed down the cheeks of Lazaro Gonzalez, Elian's
great-uncle, as he stared at a form he claimed was the Virgin Mary.

<HEADLINE> Homeless Have Address for Census  </HEADLINE>
By GENARO C. ARMAS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Gary Wolfe is homeless, but the Census Bureau
is giving him an address. He's not getting a cozy bed nor a warm
meal, but he will count -- a change of pace for many homeless whose
lives are often ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Census surveyors started visiting homeless shelters Monday to
locate as many of the nation's homeless as possible, in part to
help determine where federally funded services should be provided.
</P>
<P>
   But Wolfe doesn't believe it.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't honestly say I've seen any money from the government
from the census,'' he said on a brisk morning in downtown
Washington, huddling under a gray blanket on concrete church steps
that serve as his bed. Since he doesn't use a shelter or soup
kitchen regularly, his address, for census purposes, will be the
intersection of 10th and G streets.
</P>
<P>
   ''The census is irrelevant. The bottom line is that you have
thousands of people out here who need help,'' Wolfe said.
</P>
<P>
   To the Census Bureau, the homeless survey is known as a count of
people without fixed addresses. From New York to Los Angeles,
census-takers on Monday began surveying homeless shelters; on
Tuesday, they will stop by soup kitchens and mobile food vans.
</P>
<P>
   Then Wednesday morning, census workers will hit the streets to
locate people like Wolfe, who don't sleep in the shelters and don't
get their food regularly from soup kitchens. Enumerators will seek
information from those lying on park benches and on top of steam
grates that line city sidewalks, but they are not allowed to wake
anyone up.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'll participate, I have no problem with that,'' said Fred
Hall, a friend of Wolfe's, as he folded his blanket in the shadows
of the recently built $200 million MCI Center sports and
entertainment arena. ''I don't know how much it will help, but I'll
participate.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile Monday, the Census Bureau reported on its Web site
that 42 percent of households have returned census forms by mail
within two weeks of getting them, with a national goal of 70
percent when the count is completed.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Census Bureau and advocacy groups agree it will is
almost impossible to count all the homeless, but they say this
year's system is better than what happened in the last census.
Critics contend the 1990 count, which took place over one night,
was so flawed it was useless as a tool for designing programs to
help the homeless.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau says it undercounted about 1.4 percent of the
total population in 1990 and placed the number of homeless in 1990
at about 400,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has estimated there are about 600,000
people in the country today without fixed addresses.
</P>
<P>
   Big cities such as Detroit and New York are especially counting
on an accurate census of the homeless to reverse population
declines. A recent study by the Coalition of the Homeless in New
York showed the city may have one of the largest homeless
populations, hovering around 100,000.
</P>
<P>
   ''We empathize with the challenges'' faced by the Census Bureau,
said Mary Anne Gleason, director of the National Coalition for the
Homeless. ''It's an awesome task, and they are working hard at
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Census Bureau director Kenneth Prewitt said: ''We think what we
have in place today, because of cooperation from advocacy groups
and local leaders, will help us get a much better count than 10
years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Census officials will use statistical methods to ensure they do
not double-count people they may find in two different places.
</P>
<P>
   To help convince the homeless it is in their best interest to
cooperate, the Census Bureau has enlisted the help of homeless
advocacy groups, as well as homeless people themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Ross Weisiger, 58, is homeless and took a job as a census-taker
last week. He will help count some of the people he knows from the
downtown streets where he lives.
</P>
<P>
   ''Since they are paying $15 to $17 an hour, I said 'Hello',
knock on wood,'' said Weisiger, who is about $10,000 in debt. ''I'm
homeless, and I'm interested in helping out the homeless. They want
to use street people to count the street people.''
</P>
<P>
   Weisiger also worked as an enumerator in 1980 -- before he became
homeless -- knocking on doors in suburbia, and surveying nursing
homes. He knows he's got a much tougher job this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can tell you now there are 15 guys who are going to say 'No
way, no how will I be counted,''' said Linda Kaufman of the
downtown Washington business improvement district. She helped the
Census Bureau identify areas of homeless concentration.
</P>
<P>
   But Weisiger says he will do his best to change minds.
</P>
<P>
   ''People are not always aware what's at stake. They are into the
mistrust of government,'' he said. ''If the homeless don't want to
be counted, I can't do anything about that. But if nothing else,
we'll have a better count that we'd otherwise have.''

<HEADLINE> Mavericks 113, Jazz 105  </HEADLINE>
By TIM KORTE, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Michael Finley and the Dallas Mavericks
finally found a way to beat the Utah Jazz.
</P>
<P>
   Finley scored 24 of his 31 points in the first half, Hubert
Davis had 13 of his 15 points in the fourth quarter and Steve Nash
hit six free throws in the final 49.2 seconds as the Dallas
Mavericks beat the Jazz 113-105 on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks snapped a 12-game losing streak to Utah. They
hadn't won in Salt Lake City since Feb. 9, 1989, a span of 25
games. It also was Dallas' first victory in 21 games at the Delta
Center, which opened in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas shot well all night, building a 55-48 halftime lead on
the strength of 55.8 percent shooting.
</P>
<P>
   The loss ended Utah's four-game winning streak, a stretch where
the Jazz had seized control in the fourth quarter. But this time it
was Davis who took over at the end, hitting baskets to thwart every
Utah challenge.
</P>
<P>
   When it was finally over, the Mavericks raised their hands in
celebration and shared handshakes and hugs on the court with new
owner Mark Cuban.
</P>
<P>
   Dirk Nowitzki had 16 points and 17 rebounds, and Erick
Strickland scored 15 for Dallas, which shot 58 percent (40-of-69).
Finley hit 13-of-18.
</P>
<P>
   Karl Malone had 26 points and 10 rebounds to lead Utah but the
Jazz couldn't maintain the momentum that had delivered victories in
13 of their previous 14 games. In fact, Utah looked tired, hitting
48.1 percent (38-of-79).
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks were 10-for-10 from the foul line in the final
minute, with Nash hitting all six of his attempts.
</P>
<P>
   And each time the Jazz made a run in the closing minutes, Davis
delivered. When Utah cut it to 100-93 with 5:58 to play, Davis hit
a jumper. When the Jazz made it 102-95 with 3:01 to go, Davis hit a
3-pointer.
</P>
<P>
   And when Davis missed a 3-point attempt with 1:35, Nowitzki went
out on the perimeter to grab his 17th rebound. He also finished
with eight assists.
</P>
<P>
   During the last three games, the Jazz have been a fourth-quarter
team. They outscored the opposition 89-50 in the final period of
victories over Vancouver, Seattle and Denver.
</P>
<P>
   So the Jazz seemingly had nothing to worry about when Dallas led
88-76 after the third period. And after baskets by Howard Eisley
and Malone cut the deficit to 88-80, Utah seemed poised for a
surge.
</P>
<P>
   But Shawn Bradley scored twice as the Mavericks regained
control, 94-80, with 9:03 to play. And every time the Jazz made a
run after that, Davis hit from the floor or Nash connected from the
line.
</P>
<P>
   Bryon Russell scored 20 for Utah, John Stockton had 16 points
and 14 assists, and Jeff Hornacek scored 14.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Several Jazz players have worked through the flu bug. Greg
Ostertag was listed as doubtful, but started the second quarter.
Hornacek played sick Friday in Seattle, and Malone was ill Saturday
in Vancouver. ... Finley has played in 367 straight games, the
league's second-longest streak. Eisley is next at 348. A.C. Green
of the Lakers has played in 1,098 straight. ... Hornacek, the
league's leading free-throw shooter, missed from the line in the
second quarter. He went 2-of-3 for the game, putting him at
158-of-166 on the season.
