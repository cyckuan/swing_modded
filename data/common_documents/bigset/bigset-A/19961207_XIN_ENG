<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Plans to Resume Work on December 25 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin,
who underwent heart by-pass surgery in early November, plans to
go back to work on December 25, a parliamentary speaker said today.
</P>
<P>
The president "looks much better than before," Chairman of the
Federation Council (upper house of parliament) Yegor Stroyev told
reporters after meeting with Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Yeltsin held a 50-minute meeting with Stroyev at
his Gorki-9 residence near Moscow on the draft 1997 budget, the
wages and pensions crisis and other issues, the Itar-Tass news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"There is color in the president's cheeks today," said Stroyev,
adding that he found Yeltsin "a mobile, vigorous man."
</P>
<P>
"He told me that he had lost 20 kilograms, which is natural
after such an operation," the speaker said.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin told Stroyev he would "speak to the nation" on how he
planned to resolve the crisis over unpaid wage and pension
payments. The country is currently in the grip of a nationwide
coalminers strike, caused by delays in wage payments.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, surgeon Renat Akchurin, who performed the operation
on Yeltsin, told reporters that the president "is recuperating
quite quickly after the operation."

<HEADLINE> Russian PM Outlines Brisk Future of Russian Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin outlined his economic program for the 1997-2000
period in parliament today, saying the country would enter the
21st century with a growing economy.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the State Duma, the lower house of the Russian
parliament, Chernomyrdin underlined that "the key goals of the
government's economic policy are economic growth and reform."
</P>
<P>
Under the program, the Gross National Product (GNP) will
increase by five to six percent a year by 2000, the premier said,
adding that the focus of economic policy will be on production,
the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He said job creation was one of the crucial tasks in boosting
production.
</P>
<P>
He described as the second key priority the expansion of
investment. The task is to "make it (investment) profitable and
cost-effective," he said, adding that improved management of
the economy could boost investment to at least 600 trillion
roubles (about 109 billion U.S. dollars) by 2000.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin admitted that the Russian economy's current
performance was not good enough and said the competitiveness of
Russian goods in world markets must be ensured.
</P>
<P>
He said the medium-term economic program defines the main
directions of economic reform. The government needs to bridge the
gap between the levels of development of the Russian economy and
the economies of other developed industrialized countries.
</P>
<P>
Among its priorities, the government also highlighted the task
of achieving a tangible improvement in the standard of living. But
said inflation must be contained to within an average annual growth
rate of 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin also urged Duma deputies to approve the revised
draft budget for 1997, forecasting two percent growth in GNP, noting
that the approval would improve cooperation between the government
and the legislature.
</P>
<P>
The lower house last month rejected the government's first
draft budget for 1997, describing it as "unrealistic."

<HEADLINE> Inflation Rate Drops in Greece </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, December 6 (Xinhua) -- The inflation rate in Greece
dropped below 8 percent in November, for the first time in 25
years.
</P>
<P>
According to figures released by the National Statistics
Service of Greece (ESYE), inflation at the end of November was
running at an annual 7.7 percent, down from 8.3 percent in
October.
</P>
<P>
The ESYE said the drop was due mainly to the reduction in the
prices of fuel, fruit and hotel rates.
</P>
<P>
These reductions, the ESYE added, resulted in a 0.3 percent
reduction in the consumer price index in November, compared to a
0.2 percent increase in the same month of 1995.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Budget Deficit Set to Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 6 (Xinhua) -- The recent civil service wage and
salary increases will lead to a rise in Zimbabwe's budget deficit
from the projected 8.5 percent to 11 percent of Gross Domestic
Product by the end of the current fiscal year, Barclays Bank
has predicted.
</P>
<P>
In its December issue of the Barclays economic bulletin released
today, the bank said this would severely curtail efforts by the
government to reduce the budget deficit.
</P>
<P>
A budget deficit of 11 percent would be slightly higher than that
of the 1994/95 financial year which reached 10.1 percent of the GDP.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's high budget deficit has been widely criticised mainly
by donors as it is the main cause of the failure to restore
macro-economic stability in the country. enditem

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin, Kohl Agree to Meet Next Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
and German Chancellor Helmut Kohl today agreed to "a brief working
meeting" in Moscow next month, a presidential spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made by the two leaders during a telephone
conversation earlier today, presidential spokesman Sergei
Yastrzhembsky told a news briefing in the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin and Kohl discussed "bilateral relations and cooperation
between Russia and Germany in international affairs and agreed to
have a brief working meeting on January 4, 1997," Yastrzhembsky
said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Kohl would arrive at Moscow's Vnukovo-2 airport,
go by helicopter to Yeltsin's Zavidovo countryside residence north
of Moscow, then fly back to the airport by helicopter and return
to Germany.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin and Kohl have had three meetings this year.
</P>
<P>
They met on February 19 during Kohl's three-day official visit
to Russia. They discussed international issues, bilateral
trade-economic relations, the Chechen settlement and the
repatriation of cultural valuables relocated during World War II.
</P>
<P>
On April 19, the two met again when Kohl arrived in Moscow to
participate in the Moscow nuclear security summit. Their
one-to-one meeting touched on June's presidential elections in
Russia and the future of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Kohl paid a one-day visit to Russia on September 7. He
discussed with Yeltsin the development of economic contacts
between the two countries, including German investment in the
Russian economy.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Telecommunications Giant to Break Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Japan's Nippon Telegraph and
Telegraph (NTT) Corporation announced today that it has agreed to
split into three new firms operating under a holding company.
</P>
<P>
The announcement said the decision was made on the proposal of
the Post and Telecommunications Ministry following government
plans to lift the current ban on holding companies.
</P>
<P>
Under the breakup plan, NTT will split into one long-distance
firm and two regional carriers. The new long-distance carrier is
expected to provide international telephone services, an area in
which NTT has long wanted to get involved but has been prohibited
from entering by law.
</P>
<P>
The two regional carriers will cover eastern and western
Japan. The planned holding company will own all shares in the
three new firms, as well as the shares of other subsidiaries.
</P>
<P>
No timetable has been given for the breakup process.
</P>
<P>
The split marks an end to 14 years of dispute over the
corporate structure of the telecoms giant which erupted in 1982
when a government panel recommended the breakup of the
company. NTT opposed the plan saying it would weaken its
competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
The ministry is expected to submit bills to the next ordinary
parliamentary session due in January to amend relevant laws for
realigning NTT and giving the firm access to the international
market.

<HEADLINE> Doctors Fear Superbug That Feeds on Antibiotics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 6 (Xinhua) -- British doctors fear they have
discovered a "superbug," a mutant bacteria that thrives on the
antibiotics used to kill it.
</P>
<P>
"Have we at last witnessed the emergence of a true superbug?"
Dr. Ian Eltringham, from St. George's Hospital Medical School in
London, wrote in a letter to the medical journal The Lancet.
</P>
<P>
He and his colleagues in the school's Public Health Laboratory
school detected the bacteria in two male patients, aged 60 and
64, who were admitted to hospital a month apart.
</P>
<P>
The patients developed resistant strains of Enterococcus
Faecium, a bacteria which exists naturally in the gut, after being
treated with the powerful antibiotic vancomycin.
</P>
<P>
They only began to recover when antibiotics, seen to be feeding
the bacteria instead of killing it, were withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
The doctors described the mutant bacteria as "the ultimate
step" in the evolution of antibiotic resistance.
</P>
<P>
"We see a lot of resistant strains in hospital because a lot of
antibiotics are used," Dr. Eltringham wrote. "What was unusual
was that we found the organism had evolved into a
vancomycin-dependent strain. That meant the antibiotic intended
to kill it was making it grow. The cure had become the killer."
</P>
<P>
He added that the mutant, unable to be cultivated in the
laboratory yet, is difficult to detect. Therefore the patient is
likely to get steadily sicker without knowing the cause.

KIEV, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine's parliament will discuss
whether to force Russian troops out of the country, a
parliamentary announcement said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Parliament passed a resolution by 227 votes to 38 today in

house of parliament) claiming that the Ukrainian port city of
Sevastopol is part of Russian territory.
</P>
<P>
Sevastopol, a city on the Crimean Peninsula is the headquarters
of the Soviet-era Black Sea Fleet. Its status has become a thorny
issue in relations between Moscow and Kiev. Both have claimed the
city as their territory.
</P>
<P>
The Ukrainian parliament also planned to call on the
international community to condemn Russia for coveting Ukrainian
land.
</P>
<P>
"Sevastopol was and still is a part of Ukraine," the
announcement said.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Welcomes Albright's Appointment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, December 6 (Xinhua) -- The Cyprus government has
welcomed the appointment of U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations
Madeleine Albright to the post of U.S. Secretary of State, a
senior government official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Government spokesman Yiannakis Cassoulides told his daily
press briefing that "Albright has a good knowledge of the Cyprus
problem, which is an advantage for the promotion of our cause."
</P>
<P>
U.S President Bill Clinton Thursday named Albright as his new
Secretary of State and Republican Senator William Cohen as
Secretary of Defense.
</P>
<P>
Albright visited Cyprus last July and had meetings with both
President Glafcos Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash.
</P>
<P>
During her stay, she proposed a direct military dialogue
between the commanders of the National Guard (Cyprus' armed
forces) and the Turkish forces on the island.
</P>
<P>
The proposal, which was accepted by the Greek Cypriot side,
failed to materialize because of the persistence by the Turkish
side to include the Turkish Cypriot security forces in the
talks.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish-Cypriot community in
the north and the Greek-Cypriot community in the south since 1974
when Turkey sent troops and occupied the northern part of the
island following a short-lived coup by some Greek Cypriots
seeking union with Greece.

<HEADLINE> SFOR to Have 4-Phase Mission in Bosnia: NATO Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 6 (Xinhua) -- NATO's military authorities
today handed over a four-phase operational plan for the SFOR, the
stabilization force that is to replace the IFOR in Bosnia, to the
16 NATO ambassadors for their approval, a NATO official said.
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the mission, which is called "transition and
deployment phase," will start from December 20, when the mandate
for the current Implementation Force (IFOR) runs out, and is
expected to end 45 days after the SFOR's deployment, the official
said.
</P>
<P>
According to the same official, the second phase, which is the
main phase of the SFOR's 18-month mission in Bosnia, will then run
more or less to the end of next year.
</P>
<P>
"This phase will focus on executing the SFOR's principal
military tasks, particularly focus on critical areas where
tensions are higher," the official said.
</P>
<P>
He added that NATO had left option open for introducing extra
forces for a limited period into the theater to provide support to
the municipal elections in Bosnia, of which the date has not been
fixed yet.
</P>
<P>
"All in all," he said, "the SFOR will take a far more selective
and prioritized approach and we cannot be expected to do as much
for the civilian side as this year."
</P>
<P>
The third phase will be a "deterrence one" when the force will
be reduced "significantly." However, the official stressed that
NATO would keep a "re-entry capability" to make sure that the SFOR
can send force from outside the theater to back in once sudden
serious incidents occur.
</P>
<P>
From the spring of 1998 will be the fourth and "mission
completion phase" which means a total stop to any assistance to
the civilian implementation and total deployment of the forces out
of Bosnia before July 1998.
</P>
<P>
It was already reported that the situation of the SFOR would be
reviewed at six and 12 months after the beginning of the
operation, with a view to progressively reducing the forces'
presence to a deterrent posture and eventually withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
NATO sources said that NATO's Permanent Council would give its
provisional approval next Monday to this four-phase plan which
would then be given the political endorsement when NATO foreign
ministers meet here in Brussels the day after.

<HEADLINE> US Jobless Rate Up to 5.4 Percent in November </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 6 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. unemployment rate
rose to 5.4 percent in November, the highest in four months, the
U.S. Labor Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The department said that the jobless rate rose by 0.2
percentage point in November as the economy created 118,000
payroll jobs, smaller than expected.
</P>
<P>
The increase of jobs was also down significantly from the
224,000 payroll increase in October. The November gain was just
half of the monthly average recorded in the first half of 1996.
</P>
<P>
The November increase was led by a rise of 70,000 service jobs,
a gain that occurred despite a drop of 32,000 jobs at temporary
help firms.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturing jobs, which have been on a downward trend since
March 1995, edged up a slight 9,000 in November, the same as the
October gain. Employment in the construction industry was up by
14,000.
</P>
<P>
The unemployment rate in the U.S. fell to 5.1 percent in
August, the lowest level since March of 1989 and it went up
slightly to 5.2 percent in September and October.
</P>
<P>
The 5.4 percent unemployment rate in November, while still at a
historically low level, was the highest it has been since a
similar figure last July.
</P>
<P>
The low unemployment levels combined with an economy in the
sixth year of an expansion, already the third longest in a
half-century, were factors cited as contributing to President Bill
Clinton's victory in the November election.

<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Eleven countries have agreed to
create the Southeast European Cooperative Initiative (SECI) after
a two-day meeting which ended here today.
</P>
<P>
The regional initiative aims to encourage cooperation among
members, facilitate the access of Southeast European countries to
European integration and attract private investment, said the
statement of purpose issued at the end of the SECI's inaugural
meeting.
</P>
<P>
The SECI is to be a forum where representatives of the member
states meet to discuss regional economic and environmental
problems which demand concerted action, and will take into account
regional plans to tackle these problems, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Meetings will be followed by the setting up of ad hoc working
groups of technical experts responsible for coming up with
concrete proposals.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference after the meeting, which was sponsored by
the United States and the United Nations Economic Commission for
Europe, U.S. Ambassador Richard Schifter said that initial
invitations had been extended to all twelve countries in the
region.
</P>
<P>
But the invitation to Yugoslavia, which is made up of Serbia
and Montenegro, was withdrawn following the unrest in the country
in the wake of the government's decision to annul the results of
the country's municipal elections.
</P>

The 11 countries present at the meeting were Albania,
Bosnia-Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, the former Yugoslav
Republic of Macedonia, Hungary, Greece, Moldova, Romania, Slovenia

Marcharligne Nkhuwa in Kitwe, Copperbelt Province, today.
</P>
<P>
Speeking at a graduation ceremony for the Zambia Forestry
College for diploma and certificate holders, Nkhuwa expressed the
government's concern over the rate at which zambia's forests are being
wiped off due to heavy unplanned agricultural practices, illegal
settlements and charcoal production.
</P>
<P>
She said that the total forest reserves set aside for control
have diminished from 15 percent of the country's total forested
areas to only 7 percent since independence.
</P>
<P>
She urged the local communities and other stakeholders such as
agricultural officers, the forestry industry and non-governmental
organizations to join hands and help conserve the valuable forest
resources and the environment in general. enditem

<HEADLINE> Greece to Further Develop Cooperation in Balkans: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Greek National Defense
Undersecretary Dimitris Apostolakis said here today that Greece's
policy in the sensitive region of the Balkans was aimed at further
developing cooperation with its northern neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Apostolakis cited Greece's cooperation with Albania and
Bulgaria within the framework of the program "Partnership for
Peace," the preliminary steps being taken as part of the program
in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and the country's
participation in the implementation of the Bosnian peace accord.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking at the opening session of a two-day
international symposium on the subject of "Balkans and
Mediterranean -- partners for stability and cooperation -- the
role of international organizations -- the role of Greece''
organized by the Greek Association for Atlantic and European
Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Greece's position, Apostolakis said, was that southeastern
Europe should constitute an integral part of European structures
and the countries of the region should be incorporated in European
organizations.
</P>
<P>
"If these countries are treated as part of a grey zone," he
warned, "this will create feelings of insecurity with potentially
explosive repercussions."
</P>
<P>
"The new Europe must be built without new dividing lines on the
basis of the principles which govern international law and the
relevant treaties. The use of force or the treat of force as a
means of solving any disputes between countries cannot be
accepted. Solutions must be sought through peaceful processes," he
told the delegates.

<HEADLINE> US Fed Chairman's Remark Causes Plunge in Stock Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 6 (Xinhua)-- U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed)
chairman Allen Greenspan's remark that the stock market was
"irrational exuberance" has caused a plunge in worldwide stock
markets today.
</P>
<P>
"How do we know when irrational exuberance has unduly escalated
asset values," Greenspan said Thursday night in a speech at the
American Enterprise Institute, a Washington think-tank, according
to a report by The Wall Street Journal today.
</P>
<P>
He said, "We as central bankers need not be concerned if a
collapsing financial asset bubble does not threaten to impair the
real economy, its production, jobs, and price stability."
</P>
<P>
While he did not say clearly that the stock market is
overvalued now, he said that "the sharp stock market break of 1987
had few negative consequences for the economy."
</P>
<P>
Inside the U.S. Fed, Greenspan is known to have concerns about
the stock market's surprising rapid rise, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Stocks in New York opened with a thud this morning following a
global plunge caused by Greenspan's suggestion that the markets
were irrationally high.
</P>
<P>
The concern is that the U.S. Fed may raise interest rates to
slow the economy's growth, and with it hurt corporate profits and
stock prices.
</P>
<P>
By mid-morning, the Dow Jones industrial average was off 84.97
points, or 1.3 percent, at 6,352.13. The 30-stock average was down
more than 144 points before recovering somewhat. The technology
heavy Nasdaq Composite Index was down 1.9 percent in the early
going.
</P>
<P>
The declines followed losses in London, which fell more than 4
percent on the day before recovering somewhat, as well as Paris
and Frankfurt. Tokyo stocks overnight posted their worst decline
of the year.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Says Oil Export to Start Monday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Iraq today officially
announced that it will start its oil export after midnight of
Monday following the expected submission by the U.N. Secretary
General of his final report to the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Oil Minister Amir Mohammed Rasheed was quoted by the
Iraqi News Agency as saying that U.N. oil inspectors had
successfully inspected the checking of the metering equipment on
the Iraq-Turkey border, the pumping stations of the trans-Turkey
pipeline inside the Turkish territory as well as the flow of oil
into storage depots at the Turkish port of Ceyhan.
</P>
<P>
Rasheed said that Iraq has signed contracts with many
international companies to sell Iraqi oil with
U.N. permission. More contracts will be signed in the coming
days, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that representatives of these companies have arrived
in Baghdad and priority will be given to countries and firms
that have maintained positive attitudes toward Iraq throughout
the U.N. embargo imposed on the country following its August 1990
invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The oil minister expressed optimism over the possibility of
redoubling or increasing by 50 percent the amount of oil allowed
to be exported under the oil-for-food deal signed by Iraq and the
U.N. in May this year.
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the oil pact, Iraq is allowed to sell 2
billion U.S. dollars worth of oil every six months on renewable
basis to raise money for the purchase of food, medicine and other
humanitarian supplies for its sanctions hit population.
</P>
<P>
Iraq wants the amount of oil allowed to be exported by the
U.N. increased because of the insufficiency of oil revenue to be
used in exchange for basic needs for Iraqis living under six
years of U.N. embargo.

<HEADLINE> President: Cyprus Not to Accept Turkish Control of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus will not accept
Turkey's control over the republic's military spending to upgrade
its defense, Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides said today.
</P>
<P>
The President made the remarks while commenting on a
U.S.-proposed moratorium to ban the flights by Turkish and Greek
military aircraft over Cyprus for a limited period of time, a move
viewed as an effort to defuse tension on the island.
</P>
<P>
"Turkey now demands to be allowed to use military force
during this period, if we go ahead with certain upgrading of
our defense which Turkey does not accept," Clerides said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that "we cannot consent to an agreement which
would ban flights by Turkish aircraft on one hand but on the
other, it would give Turkey the right to pull out of such
an agreement and strike us, if we proceed with certain defense
programs."
</P>
<P>
U.S. State Department official Carey Cavanaugh put forward the
proposal to President Clerides earlier this week on the sidelines
of the summit of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe (OSCE) which ended in Lisbon, Portugal, Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking upon his arrival from Lisbon Thursday night,
President Clerides said the talks in Lisbon with Cavanaugh were
interrupted when it became known that Turkey insisted it should
have the right to take military action in Cyprus to stop arms
purchases by the government.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the U.S. proposal is expected to be
discussed in detail at a high-level meeting in Athens next
Monday, which will be attended by the defense ministers and other
high-ranking military officers of Greece and Turkey.

<HEADLINE> UK Tories in Minority After MP Quits Whip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 6 (Xinhua) -- A Conservative MP has resigned
the party's whip, which plunged the government into a
parliamentary minority, according to a BBC report this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
John Gorst is quitting over the threat to axe the full-time
casualty unit at Edgware General Hospital.
</P>
<P>
"I am today withdrawing my cooperation from the government," he
said in a statement. The move means Britain has its first minority
government since the Labor government of l979.
</P>
<P>
Gorst, MP for London's Hendon North area, earlier told deputies
that Health Secretary Stephen Dorrell had broken a promise to keep
open Edgware hospital's casualty unit.
</P>
<P>
Losing majority in the parliament will make it hard for the
Tories to push through some legislation.
</P>
<P>
Labor leader Tony Blair said, "The government is disintegrating
before our eyes. It lurches from one crisis to the next.... It is
divided and incompetent and incapable of governing the country."
</P>
<P>
"The sooner we get the chance to put them out of their misery,
the better," Blair added.
</P>
<P>
However, the opposition Labor party does not plan to force a
vote of confidence against the government after the Tory party
lost its parliamentary majority.
</P>
<P>
A Labor spokesman said in a statement, "There won't be a vote
of confidence because we're not sure of winning one." "We won't
call one because it only unites the government," he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 6 (Xinhua) -- The British Foreign Office
announced here today that British Foreign Secretary Malcolm
Rifkind was to visit Cyprus on December 16-17.
</P>
<P>
During the two-day visit, Rifkind will hold separate talks with
Cyprian President Glafcos Clerides and Foreign Minister Dinos
Michaelides to discuss a comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus
problem.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus, a former British colony, has been locked in internal
disputes between local Greek and Turkish communities for many
years. The United Nations has deployed a 2,200-strong peacekeeping
force in the country since 1963.
</P>
<P>
This will be the first visit to Cyprus by a British foreign
secretary since 1960 and Rifkind said that he was greatly looking
forward to his visit to Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
"As a Guarantor Power and a permanent member of the UN Security
Council, Britain has always been an active participant in the
international efforts to resolve the Cyprus problem," Rifkind said
in a statement.
</P>

<HEADLINE> UK New Car Sales Fall 5.4 Percent in November </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 6 (Xinhua) -- The growing momentum of the
recovery in new car sales in Britain was halted last month, with
sales falling 5.4 percent year-on-year, according to figures
released today by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders
(SMMT).
</P>
<P>
Car sales in November totaled 135,340, nearly 5 percent lower
on October's figures which showed a 13.3 percent annual increase,
and were the highest October figure on record.
</P>
<P>
Sales to private motorists dropped 6 percent while fleet and
business deals were 4.9 percent lower.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, imports rose to 60.5 percent of the market, compared
with 53.8 percent a year ago.
</P>
<P>
However, Ernie Thompson, the society's chief executive, said
that with total sales in the first 11 months 3.9 percent ahead on
the same period in 1995 at just under 1.95 million, the industry
remained on course for a market of more than 2 million this year,
the third best on record.
</P>
<P>
The SMMT said that November's fall in sales may have been
caused partly by the unexpected surge in October sales which were
boosted by the Birmingham Motor Show.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Hopes US Not to Change Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese foreign Minister Farez
Boueiz today expressed his hope that Washington would not change
its foreign policy following the nomination Madeleine Albright as
new U.S. secretary of state.
</P>
<P>
"A big country like the U.S. should have firm positions
and policy, which are represented by its secretary of state,"
the foreign minister was quoted by the state-run Lebanese
National News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think that the U.S. policy will come into the
framework of some person's temperament," the Lebanese minister
said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Albright, who had served as U.S. Ambassador to
the U.N., has "a new style and approach in the practice of
diplomacy that make some fear her dogmatic and inflexible
decisions."
</P>
<P>
The remarks implied Boueiz's disheartened feeling towards
Albright's performance in the United Nations in the past few
years.
</P>
<P>
The outgoing U.S. ambassador to the U.N. gave Arab countries a
deep impression when she cast the only veto as the Security
Council voted over an extension of U.N. Secretary General Boutros
Boutros-Ghali's mandate.
</P>
<P>
Ghali is the first Arab who has ever become the chief of the
world body.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Albright apparently failed to win a favor of
the Arabs for her statements on the critical issues in the
Middle East.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Promises Continuity of France's Africa Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 6 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
today promised African countries that France would pursue its
Africa policy adopted by the late President Francois Mitterrand,
although the policy should adjust itself to "the evolution of
things."
</P>
<P>
Chirac made the statement at the end of the 19th Franco-African
summit held today and Thursday in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faro,
according to reports.
</P>
<P>
While calling for the establishment of a partnership between
African countries and France, the president said that it is no
longer suitable for any foreign country to interfere in the
internal affairs of Africa.
</P>
<P>
"The Africa policy of mine is in the right line of that of Mr.
Mitterrand, which was not fundamentally different from that of his
predecessors, under the only reserve that each time, these
policies adjust themselves," said Chirac.
</P>
<P>
He said that France and Africa have moved from a period of
colonization to one of cooperation and partnership.
</P>
<P>
Chirac also rejected accusations that France has failed to meet
its commitment to Africa. France is the second largest donor
country to the black continent after Japan, he added.
</P>
<P>
The summit, which drew 44 African heads of state and
representatives, was focused on the crisis of the Great Lakes
region of central Africa, economic development, establishment of
law and order in Africa, and building of a security mechanism in
Africa under the auspices of the Organization of African Unity.

<HEADLINE> Israel Rejects Idea of Israeli-Palestinian Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 6 (Xinhua) -- No meeting is due to take
place between Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu and
Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat in Cairo Saturday,
reported Israel Radio tonight.
</P>
<P>
The radio, citing political sources in Jerusalem, said that in
any case it will be more appropriate to hold such a meeting in
Israel, not in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak had been
trying to host the Netanyahu-Arafat summit to iron out the
differences obstructing an agreement on partial Israeli troop
withdrawal from the West Bank town of Hebron. A senior Palestinian
official was quoted as saying that the meeting might he held in
the Egyptian capital as early as Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu and Foreign Minister David Levy met here this
afternoon with U.S. Ambassador Martin Indyk, who briefed them on
the U.S. efforts to successfully conclude the negotiations on
Hebron.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, top Israeli negotiator Yitzhak Molcho held
discussion with Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erekat.
</P>
<P>
On his way back from a three-nation European tour earlier this
week, Netanyahu expressed willingness to meet Arafat to solve the
outstanding issues on Hebron, and Arafat responded favorably.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has been talking about a proposal to move
straight to the final status talks after an agreement on
Hebron is reached. But the Palestinian side has set conditions
for a Hebron accord linking it with a definite timetable for
further redeployments in the West Bank, which were supposed to
have started on September 7 under the Oslo 2 agreement.
</P>
<P>
Ahmed Tibi, Arafat's adviser, told Israel Television that there
are still several cardinal points that must be wrapped up
first. He rejected Netanyahu's suggestion that the two sides
skip over to the final status talks immediately after a Hebron
agreement, stressing that Israel is trying to circumvent the
further withdrawal from the occupied parts of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Arafat is due to fly to Cairo for talks with Mubarak
Saturday while Netanyahu will participate in activities of the
Jewish Hanukka Holiday in Jerusalem Saturday evening after Shabbat
ends, according to an announcement of Netanyahu's media adviser
this evening.

<P>
LONDON, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Retail sales growth in Britain
slowed down in November, with a fall in the number of retailers
reporting that sales were higher than those in the previous month,
according to a survey from the Confederation of British Industry.
</P>
<P>
The latest distributive trades survey of 15,000 retail,
wholesale and motor trade outlets showed that the net balance of
high street shops reporting an increase in sales fell from 55
percent in October to 48 percent last month.

Retailers reported that sales were above average for the time

</P>
<P>
However, confidence among retailers continued to increase, with
53 percent expecting greater sales volumes and a net balance of 37
percent expecting their overall position to improve, its highest
level since August 1988.
</P>
<P>
Retail sectors most closely related to the housing market saw
the best trade last month. These include furniture, carpets,
hardware and durable goods.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, December 6 (Xinhua) -- A workshop for Uganda's timber
traders and users was held here today, with an aim of increasing
government revenue, raising the value of timber by encouraging
legal enterprises and minimizing wastage of forest resources.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony, Commissioner for Forestry in
the Ministry of Agriculture E.B. Olet said currently Uganda's
forest covers only 4 percent of the total land area, adding that
there is urgent need to conserve the existing forest resources.
</P>
<P>
Uganda is losing its forest cover at an alarming rate.
Statistics show that Uganda's forest cover has dwindled from 14
percent of its total land area in 1967 to four percent at
present.
</P>
<P>
Between 1973 and 1986 alone, the country lost a net acreage of
256 square kilometers of natural vegetation to agriculture.
</P>
<P>
At the one-day workshop, Olet called upon the participants to
desist from illegal pit swaying by acquiring licenses from the
forest department.
</P>
<P>
He called for massive tree planting and advised timber dealers
to form an association which will enable them to get easy access
to loans and better representation.
</P>
<P>
The workshop attracted more than 70 participants dealing in
timber processing, transporting and marketing in the country.

CAIRO, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian Authority (PA)
President Yasser Arafat will arrive here Saturday for a short
visit to Egypt, the Middle East News Agency (MENA) reported this
evening.
</P>
<P>
Arafat will hold talks with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
and Foreign Minister Amr Moussa on the latest developments of the
Middle East peace process, especially the Palestinian-Israeli
track.
</P>
<P>
MENA quoted Arafat's adviser Nabil Abu-Redina as saying that
Arafat was ready to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu to iron out differences between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
However, both PA Minister of Local Government Saeb Erekat and
Minister of Planning and International Cooperation Nabil Sha'ath
ruled out the possibility of holding such a meeting before
settling the current Palestinian-Israeli disputes.
</P>
<P>
Conflicting reports circulated about the Arafat-Netanyahu
meeting in the Egyptian capital in the past two days.
</P>
<P>
Ahmed Abdul-Rahman, PA spokesman in Washington, said Thursday
that Arafat would meet Netanyahu today or Saturday. He expressed
his hope that the expected meeting would change the atmosphere
currently prevailing in the region.
</P>
<P>
However, Israel Radio reported this evening that no meeting is

<HEADLINE> BWC Review Conference Supports Intensified Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, December 6 (Xinhua) -- The fourth review conference on
the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC) ended here today with a
final declaration supporting intensified work for a verification
protocol of the BWC.
</P>
<P>
The conference expressed the hope that the ad hoc group, which
began work in 1994, would reach agreement on a draft protocol to
be considered by a special conference of states parties to the BWC
"as soon as possible," and before the fifth review conference.
</P>
<P>
The conference made the decision that a fifth review conference
shall be held in Geneva at the request of the majority of states
parties to the BWC or in any case not later than 2001, according
to the final declaration.
</P>
<P>
During the two-week session, representatives of nearly 140
countries which have either ratified or acceded to the BWC
expressed the views of their governments in general debates and
closed-door discussions.
</P>
<P>
Many countries stressed that implementation of the BWC should
facilitate economic and technological development and
international cooperation in the field of peaceful biological
activities.
</P>
<P>
The United States and the European Union wanted to set a target
date of 1998 for completion of a verification protocol. Developing
countries deemed the artificial timetable not scientific.
</P>
<P>
At the second day session of the conference beginning on
November 25, Iranian representative Sirous Nasseri said, "Lack of
specific reference in the convention to a total ban could leave
the door ajar, and so Iran had formally presented specific
language for amending the convention to remedy this shortcoming."
</P>
<P>
The final declaration took note of the Iranian proposal and
recommended it for consideration by states parties. It reaffirmed
states parties' determination "to act with a view to achieving
effective progress toward general and complete disarmament,
including the prohibition and elimination of all types of weapons
of mass destruction."
</P>
<P>
The formal title of the BWC is the Convention on the
Prohibition of the Development, Production, and Stockpiling of
Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on Their
Destruction. The BWC was opened for signature in April 1972.

<HEADLINE> US Factory Orders Up by 0.9 Percent in October </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Orders to U.S. factories
increased by 0.9 percent in October, the seventh advance this
year, U.S. Commerce Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The department said that orders for both durable and nondurable
goods totaled a seasonally adjusted 321.3 billion dollars in the
month, up from 318.5 billion in September.
</P>
<P>
Orders for durable goods -- items that are expected to last
more than three years -- rose by 0.3 percent, much slower than the
4.5 percent surge in September.
</P>
<P>
The growth was almost entirely for electronic and other
electrical equipment, which shot up 17.2 percent, the fourth
increase in five months.
</P>
<P>
Transportation orders, which had shot up 2.6 percent in
September, fell by 7.7 percent in October, with all components
include aircraft and autos sharing in the loss.
</P>
<P>
Orders were down by 1.4 percent for industrial machinery and
equipment and by 0.6 percent for primary metals.
</P>
<P>
Nondurable goods such as petroleum and food products rose by
1.5 percent in October, the biggest increase since a 1.9 percent
advance in July. They had edged up 0.3 percent a month earlier and
have been up for seven months in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The report said that backlog of unfilled orders in the U.S.
increased by 1.2 percent, the fifth advance in six months.
</P>
<P>
Shipments, a measure of current activity, were up 0.1 percent,
the fourth straight gain. Inventories rose 0.3 percent, also the
fourth consecutive advance.
</P>
<P>
Factory orders are considered as a key gauge of manufacturing
strength in the U.S. and growth could mean increased production
and more jobs.
</P>
<P>
Subsequent data point to continued growth in November in the
country. A survey of the U.S. purchasing managers released earlier
this week indicated manufacturing growth soared last month to the
highest level since June.

Netherlands and then in Canada, reports said today.
</P>
<P>
The smugglers moved people first to a Western European country
with lax visa restrictions. Then they would go to Amsterdam, be
supplied with false passports and eventually fly to Canada.
</P>
<P>
Raids by the Dutch police across the country this fall resulted
in dozens of arrests and great media coverage.
</P>
<P>
However, the case has received no public attention in Canada.
And only one officer of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP)
has been assigned to pursue the investigation full time.
</P>
<P>
So far, the RCMP has charged two Iranians with conspiracy to
smuggle illegal immigrants into Canada using false travel
documents, the reports said.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Foreign Minister to Visit Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus Foreign Minister
Alecos Michaelides will pay a one-day official visit to Israel
Sunday for talks on Cyprus security as well as the Mideast peace
process.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot minister is expected to meet Israeli Prime
Minister Binyamin Netanyahu and hold talks with his Israeli
counterpart David Levy.
</P>
<P>
An official press release issued here today says that
Michaelides' talks in Israel will focus on the Cyprus problem,
the situation in the Middle East, and regional cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believed that the issue of Turkish warplane
deal with Israel will be high on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan has reportedly signed
a 600 million U.S. dollar agreement with Israel for the
modernization of Turkish F-4 fighter-bombers.
</P>
<P>
The five-year modernization project covers 54 U.S.-made F-4
planes and will be financed with Israeli credit.
</P>
<P>
The deal will involve the installation of advanced avionic
systems including radar and electronic warfare and navigation
systems.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus fears that Turkish warplane modernization might pose
threats to this eastern Mediterranean island.
</P>
<P>
Turkey still maintains about 35,000 troops in the northern
part of Cyprus, which was divided in 1974 when Turkey militarily
intervened following an Athens-backed coup.

<HEADLINE> Shuttle Columbia Returns Home After Record Flight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 6 (Xinhua) -- The U.S.'s oldest space
shuttle Columbia and the oldest astronaut ever to travel in space
returned home today, finishing a near 18-day record-setting
research mission.
</P>
<P>
Columbia touched down on the runway of Kennedy Space Center at
6:49 EST (11.49 GMT) after a mission marked by the release and
retrieval of two satellites and the cancellation of two
spacewalk.
</P>
<P>
The flight, which lasted 17 days, 15 hours, 54 minutes and 20
seconds, set a new space endurance record for NASA shuttles.
</P>
<P>
The five astronauts on board had originally planned to return
to Earth on Friday, but bad weather made the landing time
erratic. NASA had options to land its oldest shuttle any day
before next Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The two billion U.S.-dollar spaceship rocketed into orbit on
November 19, carrying the oldest person ever to travel in space,
61-year-old Story Musgrave, and two satellites.
</P>
<P>
Besides setting the age record, Musgrave tied NASA moon walker
John Young's record for the most number of space flights by any
human being. He also became the first astronaut to take part in
six shuttle missions and the first to ride in all five shuttles.
</P>
<P>
The crew released an ultraviolet telescope on November 19 for
two weeks of free flight to look at stars and galaxies. They also
deployed the Wake Shield Facility, a saucer-shaped prototype
computer chip factory,
</P>
<P>
Columbia then led the two spacecraft for an up to 120-kilometer
-long space parade, setting a NASA record for two spacecraft to
fly freely in formation with a shuttle.
</P>
<P>
The Wake Shield facility had to be picked up three hours
earlier than planned to avoid a possible space collision because
the telescope was moving faster than expected.
</P>
<P>
On Thanksgiving night, two astronauts were forced to give up
their planned spacewalk after trying unsuccessfully for two hours
to open a jammed shuttle hatch. NASA canceled the second spacewalk
two days later out of concern for the crew's safety.
</P>
<P>
The astronauts finished the mission and were ready for a home
ride on Wednesday, having retrieved the telescope which had
carried out more than 420 observations of nearly 150 objects.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Government Proposes Venue for Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 7 (Xinhua) - The Philippine government's chief
negotiator said today that the government has recommended a
northern Mindanao city as the venue of its first round of peace
talks with the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF).
</P>
<P>
Speaking over a local radio, Fortunato Abat, the government
chief negotiator, said he recommended Cagayan de Oro city, capital
of Misamis Oriental province, as the venue for peace talks to end
speculations on which side would make the first move in naming the
venue and schedule of the talks.
</P>
<P>
Abat said he had already talked with Ghadzali Jaafar, MILF
chairman for political affairs, but the latter chose to refer the
matter first to the MILF Central Committee for a consensus.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the government and MILF expressed readiness to start
the talks as soon as possible but were engaged in a deadlock after
both sides awaited at each other for suggestions to start the
talks.
</P>
<P>
The government proposal for the Cagayan de Oro meeting has also
ended perceptions on the MILF's suggestion of holding the talks
inside their camps at the borders of Lanao Del Sur and Maguindanao
provinces.
</P>
<P>
"It is not that I do not trust them, but perhaps we can talk
outside their camps because (if I agree with them) I would be
practically occupying their camps," Abat said, sticking to the
idea that negotiations be held on neutral grounds.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the MILF's demand for an independent state for
Mindanao, Abat said the talks would be in accordance with the
Philippine Constitution and sovereignty of the country.
</P>
<P>
The 12,000-strong MILF rejected a peace accord signed by the
government and the Moro National Liberation Front in September and
vowed to fight on for an independent state of Mindanao.

JOHANNESBURG, December 7 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela on Saturday urged the visiting evaluation
commission of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to
surpport Cape Town's bid for the 2004 Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
"Give us these games, we are ready for them," he told the

<HEADLINE> Charter Change Drive Gains Momentum in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 7 (Xinhua) -- A charter change drive in the
Philippines gained momentum today when labor and civic groups
formed here a new organization to campaign for President Fidel
Ramos' re-election.
</P>
<P>
In a press statement issued here, the organization, called the
Demokratikong Pagsulong ng Ekonomiya at Nasionalisymo Para sa
Sambayanan (National Democratic and Economic Growth for the
Country), said that President Ramos' re-election could consolidate
economic gains achieved by his administration and avoid certain
political instability.
</P>
<P>
But the group stressed that the charter change should pave the
way for Ramos' re-election and not extension of the term of the
president for another two years.
</P>
<P>
It also said that the amendment should benefit the president
alone and not other elected official.
</P>
<P>
According to the country's current constitution, President
Ramos is serving a single six-year term, which will end in June
1998.
</P>
<P>
The new organization was formed by the Young Engineers of the
Philippines, the Tribal Communities Association of the
Philippines, the People With Disabilities and the Federation of
Jeepney Operators and Drivers Association of the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The new organization launched its bid today at the National
Press Club in Manila, a day after the People's Initiative for
Reform, Modernization and Action (PIRMA) began a nationwide
signature-gathering drive to force constitutional changes that
would allow elected officials, including President Ramos, to seek
re-election.
</P>
<P>
However, President Ramos has repeatedly said that he has no
intention of running for a second term and will step down in June
1998.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the presidential palace said in a statement that it
has not been involved in the current charter drive.

<HEADLINE> Asian Talbe Tennis Union Holds 13th Congress in Singapore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, December 7 (Xinhua/OANA) -- A proposal to the
International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF) to shift the 45th
world table tennis championships in 1999 from Yugoslavia was one
of the decisions taken at the Asian Table Tennis Union (ATTU)
Congress here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Participants of the bilateral meeting said that it is unsafe
for them to participate in the championships due to the uncertain
situation in the country and they hinted a boycott by all of
ATTU's Islamic member organizations if the 1999 event is held in
Belgrade, Yugoslavia as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
The Congress approved an ealier decision made by the ATTU's
Executive Committee that Japan is to host the next Asian
championships in 1998. The event is set for September 27 to
October 4 in Osaka.
</P>
<P>
The Third Asian Team Cup is to take place in next January in
Shanghai, China and the fourth session is pending on discussions
inside the Union.
</P>
<P>
And China is to host the first ever Asian Club Cup next year,
which comes as an experimental event to further encourage
corporate sponsorship for the sport. A success in the inaugural
event, with the site and date yet to be fixed, would most probably
result in its replacement of the Asian Team Cup from next year on.
</P>
<P>
India is authorized to host the Sixth Asian Junior
Championships in September 1-7 next year in a venue yet to be
decided and a training camp is to be set up prior to the event, to
give more training and chances of exchanges among youngsters.
</P>
<P>
And a re-election of the ATTU leadership was carried out at
today's meeting, with all the current leaders re-elected.
</P>
<P>
Han San Kook from South Korea will remain on his post as one of
ATTU's four Vice-Presidents, although his term expires this year.
The issue of his replacement would not be discussed until next
April, the organization decided.

In the morning, Kuwaiti Amir Sheikh Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah
and Omani Sultan Qaboos Bin-Said arrived separately. Qatari Emir
Sheikh Hamad Ben Khalifa al Thani was present at Doha
International Airport to welcome them.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival, Sultan Qaboos gave a statement, saying "the
summit is convened at a time when the strategic and political
status of our region is enhanced."
</P>
<P>
"This, in itself, has put added responsibility on our states
to step up efforts to cope with this new reality ... to
contribute to bolstering joint cooperation for our states, as
well as closing Arab ranks and consolidating world peace and
security," he added.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed his hope for the success of this summit and

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania is ready to
campaign for Salim Ahmed Salim, current Secretary General of the
Organisation of African Unity (OAU), for the post of Secretary
General of the United Nations, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The campaiign will start if other countries showed interest to
support Salim as a candidate for the post, Foreign Minister
Jakaya Kikwete said in Burkina Faso on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Kikwete said that despite the lack of a new consensus on the
issue, Tanzania would drum up support for Salim if he is proposed
for the post.
</P>
<P>
According to reports reaching here, incumbent Secretary
General Boutros Boutros-Ghali has been vetoed by the United
States, claiming that the Egyptian statesman was not the right
sort of administrator to carry out extensive reform in the
operations of the UN system.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration has signaled that it would not
settle its arrears to the UN systm, stretching beyond 1.4 billion
U.S. Dollars, unless the UN actually picked a new secretary
general in whom Washington would have confidence.
</P>
<P>
Boutros-Ghali announced this week to have temporarily
suspended his bid for a second term.
</P>
<P>
Africans have not yet consulted on whether to opt for an
alternative or stick with the Egyptian deplomat and scholar, the
first African to hold the world's most influential civil service
post.
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, the secretary general holds two consecutive
terms or at least the post is retained in the same continent. The
post should in this interpretation continue to be held by an
African, Diplomats contend.
</P>
<P>
According to reports, a number of African diplomats have given
notice of intention to campaign for the post, including Kofi
Anan, an Under Secretary General at the UN in charge of peace
keeping operations, Hamid Algabid of Niger who is incumbent
secretary general of the Organisation of Islamic Conference,
Amara Essy, the Ivorian Foreign Minister and Salim, the current
OAU chief.
</P>
<P>
The OAU was still expected to hold summit level consultations
on the matter, said officials in the Foreign Ministry of
Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, South Africa is reported hat it will back Salim for
candidacy to the UN post.  enditem

<P>
CAIRO, December 7 (Xinhua) -- The newly-appointed European
Union's Middle East envoy Miguel Angel Moratinos will arrive here
today in a bid to secure the European role in putting the derailed
Mideast peace march back on track.
</P>
<P>
The EU envoy will hold talks with Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak and Foreign Minister Amr Moussa Sunday on the latest
developments of the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
Moratinos, who is also Spain's ambassador to Israel, is
currently making his first tour of the Middle East region since
his appointment in October. The tour has already taken him to
Israel, the Palestinian self-rule areas and Syria, and will take
him to Egypt, Jordan, and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel and the U.S., main sponsor of the peace process
initiated in Madrid in 1991, had been cool to an European role.
</P>
<P>
But Moratinos's appointment was welcomed by both Israel, and
the Palestinians who have been seeking a more active European role
since the right-wing Israeli government led by Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu took office last June.

<P>
BEIJING, December 7 (Xinhua) -- China has worked out a plan for
the reform of state-owned enterprises in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Wang Zhongyu, minister in charge of the State Economic and
Trade Commission, said at a national meeting that reformers should
"storm five fortified positions" in this regard.
</P>
<P>
First, a modern enterprise system will be further experimented
to get more experience. Operational Suggestions should be put
forward on how to spread the system.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, merger and bankruptcy are major contents in the
reform of sluggish state firms.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, efforts should be made to readjust industrial
structure which include enterprise setup and product mix.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, efforts should also be made to turn money-losing
enterprise into ones that make profits and to further ease
enterprises' burden brought by non-economic factors.
</P>
<P>
Wang urged that substantial progress be achieved in reforming
state firms next year.

according to a reliable sources.

The 45th world championships are slated for 1999 in Belgrade,
Yugoslavia.

situation in Yugoslavia makes the country an unsafe venue for the
event and all the Islamic members of the ATTU had strongly hinted
a collective boycott if the championships do take place there.

<P>
And at least one Asian has showed interest in taking over to
host the world championships if they are to be shift from
Belgrade.

The ITTF is believed to have this issue on the agenda for its
executive committee meeting scheduled for next week in the Chinese
city of Tianjin, which is to host the Grand Finals of this year's

He said about 24 trucks with a capacity of 50 people each have
been lined up for the repatriation exercise.
</P>
<P>
On their arrival at the border, refugees will be handed over
to the UNHCR team in Rwanda, he said, explaining that the latter
will assist the returnees to reach their respective communes.
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR official said that about 100 trucks are ready at the
Rwandese side of the border to move the refugees to the
countryside.
</P>
<P>
Preparations for the repatriation of refugees follow an
announcement by the State House on Thursday that the government
and UNHCR have agreed to request all Rwandese refugees in the
country to return home.
</P>
<P>
The move comes in the wake of a massive return of refugees
from Goma in Zaire to Rwanda, owing to the upheaval in
northeastern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
According to reports reaching here, Rwandese autorities have
assured Tanzania of a conducive environment for the refugees to
return home in safety.
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR has similarly assured refugees that sufficient
preparations had been made to receive them.
</P>
<P>
Facilities like medicines, transport, food, water and shelter
had been gathered for the repatriation and resettlement exercise
in Rwanda, noted the UN agency.  enditem

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Rear Fish in Cages in Identified Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia has identified 35
areas nationwide for rearing fish in cages to overcome the problem
of inadequate fish supply to meet higher demand, Agriculture
Minister Sulaiman Daud said today.
</P>
<P>
The technology for rearing fish in cages would come either from
Norway or Spain, both of which have proven successful in rearing
fish from the sea in cages, he told reporters after officiating
the Malaysian Fisheries Department's Quality Day in Melaka, about
150 kilometers southeast from the capital, the Malaysian national
news agency Bernama reported.
</P>
<P>
Studies are still being carried out in the areas concerned to
ensure they are sheltered from strong waves and nearer to the
mainland or islands to "facilitate maintenance and rescue in the
event of strong waves," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sulaiman said that each cage could produce between 40,000 and
50,000 fish worth 10 million ringgit (4 million US dollars), but
the overhead cost would also be high.
</P>
<P>
The minister hoped that the private sector could help in making
the project a success.
</P>
<P>
Two private companies were reported to have already offered to
implement the project.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak to Meet With Arafat Today </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
today will hold talks here with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
on ways to activate the Israeli-Palestinian peace track.
</P>
<P>
They will discuss the outcome of the talks between Egyptian
Foreign Minister Amr Moussa and Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu during the meetings of the Organization of Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) that wound up in the Portuguese
capital Lisbon last week, the Egyptian Middle East News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
But before his meeting with Arafat, Mubarak will first discuss
the matter with Moussa, who conveyed to Netanyahu the president's
second message in a week.
</P>
<P>
In his first message to Netanyahu, Mubarak warned against the
serious consequencies of Israel's settlements policy.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the exigency of achieving an agreement between
Israel and Palestinian National Authority (PNA) on the points of
differences and resuming the negotiations on the Syrian track.
</P>
<P>
Despite Palestinian and Syrian outcries, the Israeli government
has decided to build new Jewish settlements in occupied Arab lands.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, the first Arab country to have diplomatic ties with the
Jewish state, recently stepped up its attacks against the Israeli
policy.
</P>
<P>
The Mubarak-Arafat meeting takes place amid many conflicting
local reports Friday that Arafat and Netanyahu would meet in
Cairo within two days at the invitation of Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
Both Arafat and Netanyahu have reportedly shown willingness to
meet each other to reach an agreement on Hebron. Local press
reported that Netanyahu said Friday that the time is ripe to meet
with Arafat to complete the negotiations on Hebron, Arafat gave a
positive answer with no less promptness.
</P>
<P>
But Palestinian Minister of Local Government Saeb Erekat
and Minister of Planning and International Cooperation Nabil
Sha'ath ruled out the possibility of such a meeting without an
agreement eliminating pending difference in the
Palestinian-Israeli negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Moussa, upon his return from his European tour Friday, said the
summit is possible but it is not a proposal agreed upon or a
present arranged for.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Foreign donors promised to
provide Vietnam with 2.4 billion U.S. dollars in aid to support
its structural reforms and five-year plan implementation.
</P>
<P>
This was announced on Friday at a press conference here at the
end of the fourth meeting of international aid donors with the
Vietnamese government.
</P>
<P>
Javad Shirazi, chairman of the consultative group of the
meeting, said the aid exceeded the target of 2 billion
U.S. dollars set by the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
Of the pledged aid for 1997, about 500 million U.S. dollars are
in the form of non-refundable aid and the rest are loans with
preferential interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Japan committed 800 million U.S. dollars, ranking first among
the donors, while the World Bank pledged 400-500 million dollars
and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) 340 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Participants at the donor conference lauded the continued
strong performance of the Vietnamese economy in 1996, noting that
growth will exceed nine percent, inflation will remain under
control, and investment will reach nearly 30 percent of its annual
gross domestic product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
Donors urged Vietnam to mobilize necessary investment capital
from domestic and foreign sources, improve policies and
institutions necessary for enhancing the economy's efficiency and
international competitiveness, tap rich potential in human
resources, and contain environmental degradation.
</P>

Vietnam's Deputy Prime Minister Phan Van Khai reassured donors
that the government is firmly committed to deepening economic and
public institution reforms.

DHAKA, December 7 (Xinhua) -- The problem of traffic congestion
in Dhaka causes a loss of about 1.6 billion tk (37.2 million U.S.
dollars) annually, according to sources here today.
</P>
<P>
The sources quoted a World Bank report as saying that traffic
congestion in the Dhaka city has reached an alarming situation
with 160,000 motorized and 300,000 non-motorized vehicles now
plying on the city roads.
</P>
<P>
With 300,000 rickshaws, twice the number of motorized vehicles,
73 percent of road space in Dhaka is occupied by rickshaws, the
least efficient users of road, the sources noted.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, lack of parking facilities and efficient traffic
personnel are also helping create traffic congestion in Dhaka.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank report suggested an immediate action plan which
includes traffic management, widening important junctions,
construction of some of the important missing links, introduction
of efficient bus system.
</P>
<P>
It also suggested a mid-term action plan involving construction
of link roads to future satellite towns.

<HEADLINE> Vietnamese Newspaper Raps U.S. Radio </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Nhan Dan, a leading Vietnamese
newspaper, has strongly criticized the U.S. move to restore Radio
Free Asia (RFA), saying it is detrimental to the recent efforts to
improve Vietnamese-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
In a commentary on Friday, the paper called the recent U.S.
efforts to open Radio Free Asia "a move to renew the psychological
warfare in the Cold War period, using the pretext of democracy and
human rights to launch a war of ideological and cultural invasions
and interfere into Asian countries' internal affairs."
</P>
<P>
The paper said that from the idea of its establishment to
preparations for the start of its broadcasts, "Radio Free Asia has
exposed itself as a wicked political instrument and a product of
the Cold War period", which are designed "to oppose socialist
countries, including Vietnam".
</P>
<P>
"The heinous attempt of hostile forces to use RFA to undermine
Asian countries has been criticized and protested by the world,
including pro-American countries as well as a section of the
U.S. political circle who has warned that RFA will deepen the
confrontation between the U.S. and Asian nations and increase an
anti-American psychology in these countries," the paper said.
</P>
<P>
As a government-funded corporation, RFA is charged by the
U.S. Congress with broadcasting to Asian countries in Chinese,
Burmese, Korean, Khmer, Laotian and Vietnamese.
</P>
<P>
"Using RFA as a means to impose U.S. ideology, intervene in
other countries' internal affairs and destablize Asian nations is
very dangerous, obsolete and unacceptable," the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The paper also demanded that the U.S. administration abolish
its plan to begin RFA broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
It said Vietnam will intensify vigilance and take effective
measures, especially in the ideological and cultural sectors, to
frustrate all schemes and moves of the so-called "peaceful
evolution" staged by hostile forces.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Enacts 14th Constitutional Amendment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe
on Friday enacted the 14th amendment to the constitution of Zimbabwe
which imposes strict screening in the granting of citizenship to
spouses of Zimbabweans.
</P>
<P>
The Constitution of Zimbabwe Amendment (No. 14) Act also
guarantees more protection to property of foreign investors and
ensures human rights abuses are investigated.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the amendment, only foreign spouses of Zimbabwean men had
automatic citizenship rights, while foreign husbands could only be
granted citizenship when they were approved as investors or as
holders of scarce skills.
</P>
<P>
However, under the amendments, gazetted on Friday, limits are
placed on the right of all foreigners married to Zimbabwean citizens
to enter and live in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Women's groups which in the past complained about the tough
screening imposed on spouses of Zimbabwean women, have since been
quiet, seeming satisfied that both spouses now face the restrictions.
</P>
<P>
The amendment also protects the rights guaranteed to foreign
investors and other people under international treaties and
conventions to which zimbabwe is a party.
</P>
<P>
The term ''illegitimate'' when referring to children born of
unmarried parents will be banned and they shall instead be known as
''children born out of wedlock''. enditem

Certificate (ZJC) examination papers and called for maximum security
and confinentiality in the processing of the papers.
</P>
<P>
Chief Executive Peter Mabande said in a statement, the subsequent
resignation of Education Minister Edmund Garwe after admitting
responsibility for the leakagbe through his teenage daughter was a
relief.
</P>
<P>
Garwe tendered his resignation to President Robert Mugabe on
Thursday saying he accepted responsibility for the leakage of ZJC
papers at the Dominican Convent High School in Harare where his
daughter was studying.
</P>
<P>
''We feel relieved that the perpetrator of this shameful act chose
to resign and that the national ZJC examinations were not nullified
since only two candidates are said to have seen the papers,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
''However, teachers are still worried that confidential
examination question paper documents were taken home from a
consultative meeting. There must be maximum security and
confidentisality in the processing of examinations,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Garwe has since withdrawn his daughter from writing the ZJC
examinations. enditem

<HEADLINE> India Likely to Sign Thruster Deal with British Firm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 7 (Xinhua) -- India may award a
50-million-U.S.-dollar contract to a Britain-based company this
month for the supply of 20 thrusters for its satellite-2E
(Insat-2E) program, a highly-placed source said here today.
</P>
<P>
The Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) is scheduled to
launch the Insat-2E in 1997-98.
</P>
<P>
The ISRO has shortlisted two foreign bidders -- the
Britain-based Chromolloy Inc. and the U.S.-based Marcot Kaiser.
</P>
<P>
The source said the ISRO is more inclined to the British firm,
which has longer association with ISRO projects. Chromolloy Inc.
provided thrusters for Insat-2A and 2B.
</P>
<P>
Chromolloy's quoted price is 2.4 million U.S. dollars per
piece, some 10 percent higher than that offered by Marcot Kaiser.
</P>
<P>
The source said that Chromolloy has supplied over 700 thrusters
to major aviation companies worldwide, while the U.S company,
until recently, had been associated with space-related activities
in a comparatively small way.
</P>
<P>
ISRO officials and a Chromolloy delegation concluded technical
and commercial negotiations in the last week of November and are
scheduled to have their final meeting at the ISRO's Bangalore
headquarters on December 15.
</P>
<P>
The Insat-2E, now under construction, continues the ISRO's
efforts for an operational space system in the spheres of
telecommunications, radio and television broadcasts, and
meteorology.

<HEADLINE> DPRK Lashes at LDP's Decision on Yasukuni Shrine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, December 7 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) today lashed at a recent decision made
by Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) involving the
Yasukuni shrine.
</P>
<P>
A commentary published by Rodong Sinmun, the leading official
newspaper in DPRK, said that the decision, which will request
visiting foreign heads of state and other political figures to pay
homage to the Yasukuni Shrine, can never be justified and realised.
</P>
<P>
The Yasukuni Shrine houses the memorial tablets of 14 class-A
war criminals, including Hideki Tojo, who owed Asian people heavy
debts of blood, and Japan's war dead since the 19th century.
</P>
<P>
The decision shows "how persistently the Japanese rightist
reactionaries are trying to materialize the old dream of
militarism", the paper said
</P>
<P>
"The visit to the Yasukuni shrine is a sensitive issue getting
on the nerve of the Asian peoples who suffered from Japanese
aggression," the paper noted.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese authorities' attitude towards the issue has been
considered something showing the government's position concerning
Japan's history of aggression and its criminal acts.
</P>
<P>
"What the Japanese reactionaries are seeking through the visit
to the shrine by foreign state leaders and political figures is
worldwide support for the revival of militarism," it pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Their visit to the shrine is not a matter of diplomatic
practice and etiquette, but a political matter showing whether
they favor Japan's history of aggression or not, the paper
explained.
</P>
<P>
The paper urged "the Japanese reactionaries" to give up the
attempt to justify the revival of militarism with an absurd and
impudent sophism.

</P>
<P>
IBF official Jeff Robson said Friday in Denpasar of Indonesian
Bali island, that the sport governing body has decided to use the
15-point system with a 90-second break at point 8 instead of using
the 5-time-9 secoring system, which was used at the Dutch Open in
September.
</P>
<P>
"In the tournament, there is a break in each game when the
players reach eight points," Robson said. "The break is 90 seconds
and coaching is allowed. The coach can be at the side of the
court to discuss with the player how to play the rest of the game."
</P>
<P>
In the women's singles, the break is after six points and then
the setting will be only at point 10. The players have three
options: sudden death, two or three points.
</P>
<P>
In the men's singles and doubles, women's doubles and mixed
doubles, the players will have the break after eight points. The
setting options are the same.
</P>
<P>
In the third game, ends will be changed when the first player
reaches eight points, or six in women's singles, during the
interval.
</P>
<P>
Robson said that the federation needs more time to try the
system in international tournaments in order to gauge the players'
responses.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Punch Gunalan, president of the Asian Badminton
Confederation, said that its members have agreed not to support
the scoring system changes.
</P>
<P>
But they still support all efforts to develop badminton playing
and competions and to attact more spectators, Gunalan added.

<P>
SHANTOU, December 7 (Xinhua) -- The port city of Chaoyang in
south China has vowed to accelerate its urbanization process,
predicting that by 2015, its urban population will reach 70
percent of the total number of city residents.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, the status of the Chaoyang County was upgraded to a
city, in a move to promote its urbanization process. By the year
2015, a dozen smaller cities and ten towns will be set up in the
Chaoyang area, according to an official with the city government.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two years, Chaoyang has raised 1.16 billion yuan
(about 139 million US dollars) for the construction of highways
and other infrastructure facilities.
</P>
<P>
The city has also built a cargo wharf for 5,000 dwt ships, one
220-kv and three 110-kv sub-stations, and a thermal power plant
with an installed capacity of 85,000 kilowatts. It is also
equipped with a program-controlled telephone switchboard.
</P>
<P>
In Chaoyang's city of Miancheng, 830,000-sq-m of old houses
have been demolished, and 14 new quarters built in their place.
</P>
<P>
In Xiashan Town, the urban area has expanded from 0.8 to 7.0
square kilometers, thanks to a one billion yuan investment to
build highways, pipelines, apartment buildings, stores and hotels.
</P>
<P>
Chaoyang will build 18 quarters in various towns: three will be
used for residential buildings, six for industrial development,
five for business and trade, one for culture and education and
three for tourism.

<HEADLINE> HK Joins WTO Government Procurement Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Signatories to the World
Trade Organization (WTO) Agreement on Government Procurement
unanimously agreed Thursday to accept Hong Kong's participation,
according to an official release today.
</P>
<P>
"We are pleased that Hong Kong can become a party to the
Agreement. This will provide greater opportunities for our
exporters and suppliers to tap into overseas government
procurement markets," a government spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"Our participation in the Agreement would also reinforce the
confidence of overseas and local suppliers in our already open and
non-discriminatory government procurement system," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Agreement on Government Procurement provides for a set of
rules that govern the procurement of goods and services by
government and other public entities of signatories.
</P>
<P>
Under the Agreement, each signatory is obliged to treat the
products, services and suppliers of other signatories in public
procurement as if they were of domestic origin.
</P>
<P>
The Agreement was first concluded in 1994. Hong Kong did not
sign the Agreement then because other negotiating parties included
at the final stage of negotiations some discriminatory provisions
in the Agreement which were objectionable in principle to Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman explained that now the signatories have agreed to
remove these discriminatory provisions targeted specifically
against Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> 3 Global Giants Vie for India's Aviation Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Three global aircraft giants
have reportedly come out with fresh baits to bag the 2 billion US
dollars worth contract for Air India's passenger fleet, scheduled
to be finalized by March next year, Aviation Ministry sources said
here today.
</P>
<P>
While the American Boeing has offered 30 percent of the total
contract value as subcontracts to Indian firms, the European
Airbus Industries has gone one step ahead placing a 50 million
dollars worth contract for supply of doors for its A-320 aircraft
besides offering the 30 percent subcontract bait.
</P>
<P>
Airbus Industries spokesman David Velupillai said that the
contract to India's Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd. (HAL) to produce
600 ship sets showed the confidence his company had in India. He
also pointed out that 60 percent of Air India's present fleet
consisted of Airbus planes. Moreover, Airbus had been the first to
award a contract worth 50 million dollars to HAL.
</P>
<P>
The 30 percent subcontract offered by Boeing, which would work
out to 600 million dollars, would consist of manufacture of doors
and parts of subsystems, besides various aviation software. Boeing
spokesman Dinesh Keshar said that his company wanted to involve
HAL in several of its ongoing projects mainly because of its
technical competence.
</P>
<P>
A recent contract to digitize drawings of Boeing-747 worth 3
million dollars was being successfully implemented by HAL. The
contract was to convert old manual drawings of the earlier 747
planes into computer images for the design of new-generation
Boeing planes.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, another competitor for this big deal, McDonnell
Douglas, is finishing a third with its MD-11, a 100-seater twin
jet.
</P>
<P>
"In this kind of deals, it is not the merit of the product that
matters most, but several other considerations go into merit," a
top Air India official said.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Remains Firm on Labor Issue at WTO Meeting </HEADLINE>

<P>
BANGKOK, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Thailand will stand by its
position on opposing any attempt to introduce the issues of labor
standards at the first World Trade Organization (WTO) ministerial
meeting scheduled for December 9-12 in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Thai Deputy Prime Minister Amnuay Virawan reiterated this
position after a Thai government coordinating meeting on the WTO
issues on Friday at the government house.
</P>
<P>
But Amnuay said Thailand will support the entry of all 28
applicants for WTO membership at the Singapore meeting, including
China, Laos, Russia and Cambodia, according to local newspapers
today.
</P>
<P>
Amnuay will lead a Thai delegation to attend the meeting where
delegates from at least 120 countries and regions will sort out
their differences over farm trade liberalization, textiles and
labor standards, and new issues like government procurement and
efforts to create global rules on investment.
</P>
<P>
Thailand is expected not to endorse a U.S.-supported
information technology agreement. Thai Commerce Minister
Narongchai Akrasanee, who will accompany Amnuay to the Singapore
meeting, pointed out that it is impossible to end tariffs on
information technology products.
</P>
<P>
However, Thailand reportedly will propose a flexible timeframe
for the agreement at the meeting with final tariff rates and a
list of items to be covered.

WASHINGTON, December 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Warren Christopher met his visiting Pakistani counterpart Friday
and the two held talks on bilateral and international issues, the
U.S. State Department said.
</P>
<P>
Christopher and Pakistani Foreign Minister Sahabzada Yakub
Khan, who began a two-day visit to Washington on Thursday, "had
very good discussions" on recent internal developments in
Pakistan, State Department Spokesman Nicholas Burns said.
</P>
<P>
"The secretary applauded the interim government's efforts to
restore economic stability in Pakistan," he said.
</P>
<P>
A caretaker cabinet was inaugurated in the south Asian country
in early November, after Pakistani president dismissed Prime
Minister Benazir Bhutto on charges of corruption and incompetence.
</P>
<P>
The talks also touched on Afghanistan and U.S. concerns about
non-proliferation, Burns said.
</P>
<P>
Khan also discussed with Christopher about prospects for
dialogue between Pakistan and India.
</P>
<P>
He said he expected to meet Indian officials later this month
during a ministerial meeting of the South Asian Association for
Regional Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Khan, former ambassador to the United States, was scheduled to
meet U.S. National Security Adviser Anthony Lake and Defense

<HEADLINE> UC Anti-Affirmative Action Proposition Blocked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 6 (Xinhua) -- A federal judge in San
Francisco on Friday blocked the University of California (UC) from
implementing Proposition 209, barring the university from
canceling affirmative action policies in decisions concerning
spring 1997 admissions and financial aid.
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Thelton Henderson will consider arguments
by civil rights groups for a preliminary injunction against the
anti-affirmative action law on December 16.
</P>
<P>
Henderson said he found "an immediate possibility of
irreparable harm" if the measure remained in effect, while the
state would not suffer from "the continuation for a few days of
affirmative action programs already in place," the United Press
International reported.
</P>
<P>
Tirso del Junco, chairman of the Board of Regents, said Friday
that the university passed its own anti-affirmative action measure
in July 1995 and was already well along in the process of
eliminating race and gender as factors in admission, hiring and
contracting.
</P>
<P>
The UC policy would have taken effect for students applying for
spring 1998 enrollment -- one year later than what is required by
Proposition 209.
</P>
<P>
The measure would have sped up implementation of the
university's own anti-affirmative action policy, del Junco said.
</P>
<P>
On November 27, Henderson issued a restraining order barring
the governor and attorney general from implementing the measure,
which was approved by 55 percent of California voters in the
November 5 election.

<HEADLINE> World War Two Bomb Dismantled near Berlin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, December 6 (Xinhua) -- German experts on Tuesday
successfully defused a bomb dropped by the U.S. air force during
the Second World War at Oranienburg, a city close to Berlin.
</P>
<P>
The 500-kilogram bomb, the biggest among the 50 handled so far,
was 7.5 meters deep into the earth. It took the experts six hours
to take out the chemical fuse of the bomb.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of people evacuated from four schools,
several factories near the site were allowed to come back after
the work was done.
</P>
<P>
Oranienburg served as an important military base of the Nazi
and a stronghold for the Schutzstaffels during the war.
</P>
<P>
It became a major target of the U.S. air force because there
located airports and heavy water research laboratory.
</P>
<P>
On March 15, 1945 alone, 3,000 bombs were dropped to this city
and 300 of them did not go off.
</P>
<P>
Former East Germany began to eliminate these unexploded bombs
after the war and the united Germany continued the job.

BANGKOK, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Thailand will seek the
chairmanship of the Intellectual Property Committee of the World

</P>
<P>
The bid will be made at the WTO meeting scheduled from Monday

here Friday after a WTO preparatory ministerial meeting at the
Government House.
</P>
<P>
"It would be beneficial for Thailand as it would enable us to

regulations," said Kobsak Chutikul, director-general of the
Department of Economic Affairs in the Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
He said Thailand's bid is widely backed by WTO members as its
permanent representative at the WTO, Krirk-Krai Jirapaet, has
received pledges of support from many of his counterparts.
</P>
<P>
Thailand will also urge other developing countries to actively
participate in the preparation of WTO regulations to prevent any
conflict arising from differences between developed and developing
countries, Kobsak said.
</P>
<P>
He said that his country supports the WTO's acceptance of 28
applicants as full members, including Cambodia, China, Laos,

<HEADLINE> Japan, U.S. Hold Working-Level Insurance Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Japan and the United States
continued the working-level meeting today morning, with a hope to
find a way to settle their prolonged insurance disputes after
making little progress at yesterday's talks, Kyodo reported today.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka and acting
U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky held the first-day
session of their two-day talks Friday night, but were unable to
narrow their differences over Japan's measures to deregulate its
insurance market under a 1994 bilateral insurance accord.
</P>
<P>
The dispute centers on U.S. allegations that Japan will violate
the 1994 accord by opening up the so-called "third sector" of its
insurance market before substantially deregulating the primary
life and non-life insurance sectors, which are dominated by the
Japanese domestic companies.
</P>
<P>
The third sector covers cancer, personal accident,
hospitalization and other insurance policies that fall into a gray
zone between the life and non-life insurance businesses.
</P>
<P>
Although it accounts for only 5 percent of Japan's overall
insurance market, the third sector has become a major source of
earnings for foreign insurers operating in Japan.
</P>
<P>
After failing to narrow differences in several rounds of talks,
the two countries agreed in October on the December 15 deadline,
with Japan freezing the entry of newly licensed subsidiaries of
major life and non-life insurers into the third sector until
December 31.
</P>
<P>
Japan has insisted that without an insurance accord by December
15, it will allow the subsidiaries to sell third-sector products
from January 1.
</P>
<P>
Washington has threatened to retaliate if Tokyo authorizes
their entry without first striking an agreement with the U.S.
</P>
<P>
The working-level session is scheduled to be followed by
ministerial talks between Mitsuzuka and Barshefsky. If they fail
to work out an accord, it would mean a virtual breakdown of the
insurance talks.

<HEADLINE> Weekly Report on Kuala Lumpur Stock Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Share prices on the Kuala
Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE) ended the week broadly lower across
the board with the Composite Index touching the 1,900 level at the
close after hovering at 1,220 for the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
The market came under selling pressure following comments by
U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, which were taken by
market players to mean that the Federal Reserve was concerned
about the recent surge in U.S. stock prices.
</P>
<P>
Analysts are of the view that the fall was not surprising given
the spillover effect of market declines in other regions,
particularly in the Nikkei and Hang Seng markets, both suffering
serious battering on fears that the comments would lead to a
possible hike in U.S. interests.
</P>
<P>
On the KLSE market, the CI closed as low as 1,191.32, down
33.62 points, compared with last week's closing level of 1,226.52
in anticipation that the Dow Jones would drop by 100 to 150 points
overnight.
</P>
<P>
The all main board stocks Emas Index closed at 336.38, down
8.88 points, and the Industrial Index lost 70.12 points to

The second board index lost 22.97 points to 540.90, reflecting
the shift in interest to the main board.
</P>
<P>
One analyst said, however, that the second board correction was

<HEADLINE> Japan, U.S. Hold Working-Level Insurance Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Japan and the United States
continued the working-level meeting today morning, with a hope to
find a way to settle their prolonged insurance disputes after
making little progress at yesterday's talks, Kyodo reported today.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka and acting
U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky held the first-day
session of their two-day talks Friday night, but were unable to
narrow their differences over Japan's measures to deregulate its
insurance market under a 1994 bilateral insurance accord.
</P>
<P>
The dispute centers on U.S. allegations that Japan will violate
the 1994 accord by opening up the so-called "third sector" of its
insurance market before substantially deregulating the primary
life and non-life insurance sectors, which are dominated by the
Japanese domestic companies.
</P>
<P>
The third sector covers cancer, personal accident,
hospitalization and other insurance policies that fall into a gray
zone between the life and non-life insurance businesses.
</P>
<P>
Although it accounts for only 5 percent of Japan's overall
insurance market, the third sector has become a major source of
earnings for foreign insurers operating in Japan.
</P>
<P>
After failing to narrow differences in several rounds of talks,
the two countries agreed in October on the December 15 deadline,
with Japan freezing the entry of newly licensed subsidiaries of
major life and non-life insurers into the third sector until
December 31.
</P>
<P>
Japan has insisted that without an insurance accord by December
15, it will allow the subsidiaries to sell third-sector products
from January 1.
</P>
<P>
Washington has threatened to retaliate if Tokyo authorizes
their entry without first striking an agreement with the U.S.
</P>
<P>
The working-level session is scheduled to be followed by
ministerial talks between Mitsuzuka and Barshefsky. If they fail
to work out an accord, it would mean a virtual breakdown of the
insurance talks.

<HEADLINE> Weekly Report on Malaysia's CPO, Tin, Rubber Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's markets of
crude palm oil (CPO), tin and rubber closed the week all lower.
</P>
<P>
The year-end factor saw CPO physicals in see-saw trading this
week awaiting clearer indications to lift market sentiment.
</P>
<P>
The market, depressed in tandem with the weaker Chicago Board
of Trade (CBOT) and Kuala Lumpur Commodity Exchange (KLCE), traded
in clueless direction.
</P>
<P>
The downtrend on both futures markets resulted in players
sidelined ahead of the release of production and stock forecasts
by private forecaster Ivan Wong.
</P>
<P>
The forecaster predicted Friday that the production would fall
by 14 percent to 764,000 tons and stocks would rise to 965,000
tons from 953,241 tons in October, with exports slipping to
655,000 tons from 727,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
The market rebounded in the middle of the week on rumors of
Pakistan's tender for 6,000 tons of refined, bleached and
deodorized (RBD) palm oil for January 10 shipment.
</P>
<P>
December South slipped to 1,205 ringgit (about 482 U.S.
dollars) per ton at the close from 1,215 ringgit (about 486 U.S.
dollars) the previous week.
</P>
<P>
The Kuala Lumpur Tin Market (KLTM) ended the week lower in a
very tight range of only one ringgit (about 40 U.S. cents) due to
the performance on the London Metal Exchange (LME) throughout the
week.
</P>
<P>
Absence of buying interest due to the ringgit's strength
against the U.S. dollar this week dampened market activity.
</P>
<P>
The ringgit closed higher against the greenback at 2.5180/90
compared with 2.5250/60 last week.
</P>
<P>
The market lost eight sen to 14.99 ringgit (about 5.996 U.S.
dollars) per kilogram from 15.07 ringgit (about 6.028 U.S.
dollars) last week.
</P>
<P>
This week's accumulated turnover dropped sharply to 377 tons
from 608 tons the previous week.
</P>
<P>
Uncertainty over the Malaysian rubber market's direction
towards the year-end forced a plunge in prices this week.
</P>
<P>
Any new indication was expected to perk up the dull market as
it awaited fresh leads.
</P>
<P>
The market began mixed this week on anticipation that the wet
weather would affect supply and help boost market sentiment.
</P>
<P>
However, players were turned down on absence of major players
from Europe and China.
</P>
<P>
January RSS One lost two sen to 315.50 sen (about 126.2 U.S.
cents) per kilogram at the close this week from 317.50 sen (about
127 U.S. cents) per kilogram last week.
</P>
<P>
SMR 20 also slipped by two sen to 303.50 sen (about 121.4 U.S.
cents) per kilogram from 305.50 sen (about 122.2 U.S. cents) per
kilogram last week.

<HEADLINE> Romanian Parties Sign Coalition Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Romania's three major
parties, which won the elections last month, signed a coalition
agreement today to ensure "a stable government" in the next four
years.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached between the Democratic Convention of
Romania (DCR), the Social Democratic Union (USD) and the Hungarian
Democratic Union (UDMR).
</P>
<P>
At the signing ceremony, Ion Diaconescu, DCR chairman and
newly-elected chairman of the Chamber of Deputies, the lower
house, said the DCR must sign a coalition accord with the other
parties to guarantee a "stable government" as the DCR had not won
an absolute majority in the parliamentary elections on November 3.
</P>
<P>
The DCR won 37.06 percent of the seats in the senate while the
USD obtained 16.08 percent and the UDMR 7.69 percent.
</P>
<P>
The coalition gave the three parties a 60.83 percent majority
in the senate and a similar weight in the Chamber of Deputies.
</P>
<P>
The three parties also agreed on the new government's governing
programs: a six-month short-term program focused on improving
living conditions and social welfare for the poor and a long-term
program aimed at speeding up Romania's economic reform.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister-designate Victor Ciorbea told reporters today
that the line-up of the new cabinet has been decided and he would
submit the list to the parliament for approval next Monday.

<HEADLINE> Movement Launched to Amend Philippine Constitution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 7 (Xinhua) -- A Philippine group supporting
the re-election of President Fidel Ramos has launched a movement
to change the limit on the presidential term prescribed by the
country's constitution, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The group, which calls itself "the People's Initiative for
Reform, Modernization and Action" (PIRMA), Friday formally asked
the Commission on Election to set the date for it to begin
gathering signatures required for a plebiscite on constitution
changes.
</P>
<P>
The constitution sets a single-term limit on the president to
prevent recurrence of dictatorships in the Philippines, which had
been under a 20-year rule by Ferdinand Marcos before 1986.
</P>
<P>
Ramos, who took office in 1992, will reach the end of his
six-year term in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine constitution allows amendment in three ways: by
Congress as a constituent assembly, by Congress calling for a
Constitutional Convention, or through a people's initiative.
</P>
<P>
The PIRMA must secure at least 7.2 million signatures before
the Commission on Election can recognize the movement as a
legitimate people's initiative and call for a nationwide vote.
</P>
<P>
On Friday's press launch, the PIRMA said it hoped to gather at
least 5 million signatures by January 15 next year. It also asked
the commission to declare a plebiscite period between January 11
and June 11 next year.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, the commission warned that the PIRMA's efforts
might be "futile" because of the time constraint.
</P>
<P>
The pressure on the PIRMA is further aggravated by a strong
coalition in the country that has vowed to wage a vigorous
campaign against the signature-gathering movement.
</P>
<P>
Opposition congressmen, human rights groups, church-based
organizations and business groups in the Philippines have forged a
covenant and are determined to foil any attempt to change the
constitution.
</P>
<P>
The Coalition Against State Terrorism, which leads the
anti-PIRMA move, said that it will question before the Supreme
Court the constitutionality of the signature-collecting campaign.
</P>
<P>
Some senators said the ruling LAKAS-NUCD party is behind the
PIRMA movement, noting that it would not be so well financed if it
were not backed by the ruling party.
</P>
<P>
Some of the senators expressed fears that with the support of
the ruling party, the PIRMA could accomplish its campaign in just
three days, as the party alone can offer the needed signatures.
</P>
<P>
"If that is the case, the people's initiative will be so swift
... so fast that we won't know what had hit us," Representative
Jose Zubiri said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Presidential Executive Secretary Ruben Torres refuted the
charge, saying that the signature campaign was "purely the
initiative of people."
</P>
<P>
He said that both the ruling party and the Presidential Palace
were "surprised that they are conducting this signature campaign
nationwide."
</P>
<P>
He denied that the Presidential Palace had any connection with
the campaign and confirmed that President Ramos would not seek
re-election even if the movement succeeds in having the
constitution amended.

<HEADLINE> General Motors Mulls Plant in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 7 (Xinhua) -- General Motors will invest in a
variety of projects in the Philippines to complement its car
manufacturing plant in Thailand and is interested in making the
country one of its hubs in Asia.
</P>
<P>
General Motors (GM) President Donald Sullivan made the remarks
during a meeting Thursday with Philippine President Fidel Ramos,
who earlier wrote to top GM officials convincing them of the
advantage of putting up an overseas plant in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Ramos, in turn, ordered Trade and Industry Secretary Cesar
Bautista to form a study group composed of representatives from
the Board of Investment and GM to identify the areas in the
automobile industry where the American car maker can participate.
</P>
<P>
Bautista said that GM will determine specific projects on the
basis of the results of the study and that a final decision might
be available from the GM chief in a month's time.
</P>
<P>
Philippine trade officials have been luring GM to put up a 1
billion-U.S.-dollar regional manufacturing base for GM vehicles
and spare parts in the country.
</P>
<P>
The proposed plant is expected to manufacture some 100,000
units yearly for export to neighboring countries and will generate
employment for more than 30,000 Filipinos. Eighty percent of the
vehicles to be assembled in the plant will be exported to Japan.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Big Banks Reap Record Profits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Profits for Canada's Big Six
banks shot to a record high of 4.66 billion U.S. dollars for
fiscal 1996, almost 22 percent higher than its 1995 level.
</P>
<P>
Royal Bank of Canada, the largest of all, raked in 1.058
billion dollars, up 13 percent over last year.
</P>
<P>
Profit at National Bank, the smallest of the Big Six, reached
235 million, which is 30 percent ahead of 1995 for the fiscal year
that ended October 31.
</P>
<P>
The high profits put the group's average return on equity to
16.23 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Soaring stock market activity and plunging loan losses are the
two main factors behind the surge, the banks stressed.
</P>
<P>
The industry's record profits, particularly that of the Royal
Bank, the highest tally ever reported by any Canadian company,
have also come to be big public relations headaches.
</P>
<P>
Rallies against the banks were held in seven cities across the
country Thursday, and there have been calls for a tax on "excess"
bank and other corporate profits to finance a national job
creation scheme, reports said today.
</P>
<P>
A group called Democracy Watch reiterated an earlier demand
that banks be forced to disclose more information about their
costs and profits so that consumers can tell if they are being
"gouged" on such items as service charges and credit card interest
rates.
</P>
<P>
So far, this has been echoed by some members of the parliament,
who called for a public inquiry into card rates.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Ready for WTO Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Thailand has prepared its
negotiating position for the World Trade Organization's
ministerial meeting on Monday in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's emphasis is on agricultural and textile products,
according to local newspaper Bangkok Post today.
</P>
<P>
Thai Commerce Minister Narongchai Akraseni will leave Sunday
for Singapore for the WTO meeting.
</P>
<P>
Narongchai said Thailand could not be bound to scrap tariffs by
2000 on trade in information technology products, although it
agreed liberalization of this sector would benefit the country.
</P>
<P>
Thailand already had a low average tariff of 0.5 percent on
imports of information technology, expect for basic telephones
taxed 20 percent, and could not afford to scrap it, he said.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister Amnuay Virawan said although the United
States would press for an information technology agreement,
Thailand wanted flexibility in negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The ministerial meeting, the first held by the WTO, is likely
to see compromise between developing and developed nations, he
predicted.
</P>
<P>
Narongchai said labor protection should be discussed by the
International Labor Organization rather than the WTO, but Thailand
agreed that child workers should be safeguarded.
</P>
<P>
Amnuay said Thailand was ready to discuss liberalization of
basic telecommunications but that liberalization should proceed in
stages based on the economic development of each member.

<HEADLINE> Ukrainian Parliament Urges Pull-out of Foreign Troops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Ukrainian lawmakers will debate on
a draft law preparing the withdrawal of foreign troops from its
territory in a furious response to Russian parliament's claim to
its Black Sea naval port of Sevastopol.
</P>
<P>
This was announced in a Ukrainian parliament statement issued
here today after Russia's Federation Council, upper house of the
parliament, stated Tuesday that Sevastopol, base of the former
Soviet Black Sea Fleet, belonged to Russia.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, parliament chairman Alexander Moroz said
Moscow had been warned not to make any claim to Ukrainian
territory and accused his Russian colleagues of jeopardizing
European security.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the status of Sevastopol should not be
changed. It belonged to and will always belong to Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
Though the Ukrainian constitution bans foreign troops from its
soil, its amendment allows foreign lease of military installations
under parliament-approved international treaties.
</P>
<P>
There are about 150 ships and at least 12,000 sailors under
Russian command in Sevastopol.
</P>
<P>
Moscow and Kiev have been arguing about how to split the fleet
since the collapse of the former Soviet Union in 1991. They agreed
in principle that Moscow should lease the port for 20 years, but
with no agreement signed and Russian Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin's planned November 15 visit here never realized.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Budweiser Beer Breaks Into Philippine Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 7 (Xinhua) -- The world's largest brewer of
beers, Anheuser-Busch International Inc. of the U.S., will
formally sign an agreement here next week with the Manila-based
Asia Brewery Inc., one of the largest beer makers in Asia, to make
and sell Budweiser beer in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
August A. Busch, chairman and chief executive officer of
Anheuser-Busch International Inc., will arrive in Manila Monday to
sign the agreement, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Asia Brewery will brew Budweiser beer
under the supervision of one of the company's brewmasters, said
Stephen Burrows, president and chief operating officer of
Anheuser-Busch International.
</P>
<P>
Anheuser-Busch will direct marketing of the brand in the
Philippines, while Asia Brewery will direct distribution, Burrows
said.
</P>
<P>
The move marks another step by Anheuser-Busch to break into
markets overseas, particularly in Asia. The Philippines is Asia's
fifth largest beer market.
</P>
<P>
Asia Brewery is the second largest beer producer in the
Philippines next to food and beverage giant San Miguel Corp.,
which occupies about 81 percent of the country's market.
</P>
<P>
Asia Brewery is also one of Asia's largest and most modern
breweries, which boasts a host of international premium beer
brands.
</P>
<P>
Burrows said that Anheuser-Busch is impressed by the capability
of Asia Brewery to capture market share from San Miguel.
</P>
<P>
Anheuser-Busch has a 144-year history of brewing high quality
beers. From a tiny family-owned brewery in St. Louis, Missouri, in
1860, Anheuser-Busch dramatically grew to become what it is today
-- a leading brewer in the U.S. and the biggest brewery in the
world. Anheuser-Busch first brewed Budweiser in 1876.

<P>
BANGKOK, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Thailand is ready to help
Vietnam develop the capital market since it has promising economic
growth prospects, according to Chatumongkol Sonakul, permanent
secretary of the Thai Finance Ministry.
</P>
<P>
In earlier discussions with former Thai finance minister
Surakiart Sthirathai, Vietnamese officials asked Thailand to send
experts to help set up a stock market in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Thai and Vietnamese officials will discuss the issue in Hanoi
on December 19 and 20.
</P>
<P>
Chatumongkol was quoted today by local newspaper Bangkok Post
as saying that a capital market is essential for an emerging
economy such as Vietnam, which needs huge amounts of capital to
finance infrastructure and basic industries.
</P>
<P>
A stock market in Vietnam, especially one established with Thai
help, could benefit Thailand in the long term, he said. If the two
markets could be linked in some way, economic expansion in both
countries would be promoted.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam is also interested in studying Thailand's customs
regulations and excise tax system, he said.

Out go the "slick" treadless dry weather tyres, to be replaced
by grooved compounds, the International Automobile Federation
(FIA) World Council decided on Friday.
</P>
<P>
New rules on brakes will be introduced, aimed at increasing
stopping distances. This means that drivers will have to brake
earlier on approaching corners, theoretically giving a more
skilful driver the chance to overtake.
</P>
<P>
The FIA also decided to reduce the maximum overall width of

<HEADLINE> Plutonium in Russian Space Capsule Not to Affect Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, December 6 (Xinhua) -- The amount of plutonium
contained in the Mars-96 Russian space capsule that fell into the
Pacific Ocean on November 16 is not enough to affect the
environment, the Chilean Defense Ministry said today.
</P>
<P>
Only 270 grams of plutonium 248, a highly toxic radioactive
element, were kept as fuel in each of the four small
thermoelectric generators, said a release from the Defense
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The plutonium was kept into 18 leak-proof microcontainers,
which can resist temperatures up to 2,400 degrees centigrade, high
atmospheric pressure and high-speed impact.
</P>
<P>
The adoption of maximum security measures in the construction
of the capsule guarantees the almost total absence of danger for
the environment and human life, said the release.

<HEADLINE> Ministry Moves to Stabilize Grain Output </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 7 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Agriculture is
making efforts to stabilize the country's grain harvest next year,
according to the Ministry of Agriculture, said "China Daily" today.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Communist Party Central Committee and the ministry
will convene separate conferences in the next two months to
discuss measures to further boost agricultural production and cope
with problems that might come up after bumper harvests, according
to ministry officials.
</P>
<P>
China's grain production hit a new record of 480 million tons
this year after farmers set a record of 465 million tons last
year. These results are attributable to favourable government
policies and good weather.
</P>
<P>
However, ministry officials and experts have warned that unless
the government works out effective measures to protect farmers'
enthusiasm for grain production, output could stagnate or fall, as
has happened in past decades.
</P>
<P>
According to a survey released by the State Statistics Bureau
this week, farmers plan to increase grain acreage by 2.2 percent
in their autumn and winter sowing. They are apparently inspired by
this year's good prices of grain, including State purchase prices,
according to the ministry.
</P>
<P>
The increased acreage may promise a bumper harvest next summer.
</P>
<P>
But experts warn that grain prices have started to slide. If
the trend is not checked, it might affect grain growing later.

MANILA, December 7 (Xinhua) -- The following are Philippine
business news in brief:
</P>
<P>
-- Sales of locally assembled passenger cars in the Philippines
grew by 24.1 percent in the first 11 months of the year despite an
11.5 percent decline last month, the Chamber of Automotive
Manufacturers of the Philippines said in a document released here
today. It said that the industry, as of end-November, has already
exceeded its sales target of 80,000 units by 368 units.
</P>
<P>
-- Philippine Airlines Inc. said that a government ruling in
favor of its pilots union may force it to cut back on orders for
seven Boeing and four Airbus Industrie jets. It said that it would
appeal a decision by the Department of Labor and Employment that
requires the airlines to use two first officers on long-haul
flights. The airlines, which said one officer would be adequate,
said the ruling would increase its costs and jeopardize a
4-billion-U.S.-dollar expansion and modernization program.
</P>
<P>
--The Philippine government said Friday that Detroit-based car
giant General Motors Corp. (GM) is planning to open several
automotive related projects in the Philippines. "They are
considering a lot of projects here, but the specific ones will
come out later. In a month's time, a final decision from the GM
chairman might be available," Trade and Industry Secretary Cesar
Bautista said.

SAN JOSE, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Costa Rican police sources
said today that the killing of a Colombian Wednesday at a parking
lot of a discotheque here could have been linked to drug
trafficking.
</P>
<P>
The sources said it could have been a revenge or an incident in
relation with drug trafficking.

<P>
SHENYANG, December 7 (Xinhua) -- China will further deepen
reforms in enterprises, especially in state-owned ones, and seek a
coordinated development for its national economy in the year 1997,
a senior Chinese economic official said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Wang Zhongyu, director of the State Economic and Trade
Commission under the State Council, China's cabinet, made these
remarks at a national conference on economic and trade work, which
opened yesterday in Shenyang, capital of northeast China's
Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
"The general situation for China's national economy this year
is good, as we have effectively controlled inflation while
maintaining a rapid economic growth," he said in a report to the
conference.
</P>
<P>
He added that in 1996, the overall supply and demand of the
society tend to reach a balance, and the country has gained major
harvests in the agricultural sector.
</P>
<P>
"All these achievements have created favorable conditions for
the reform and development of the state-owned enterprises next
year," he noted.
</P>
<P>
However, he conceded that there are also a number of
difficulties facing Chinese economy next year, which include no
major growth in the general social demand, and incompatibility
between the products structure and the market requirements.
</P>
<P>
"With the establishment of the market economy system and
deepening of various reforms, the gap will be widened between
enterprises with good and poor performance, and some sectors and
enterprises could face greater difficulties," he said.

<HEADLINE> China Making Full Preparations for Lianyungang Nuclear Power Plant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 7 (Xinhua) -- China is wasting no time to
complete comprehensive plans for the Lianyungang Nuclear Power
Plant, a Sino-Russian cooperative project to be launched in the
country's Ninth Five-Year Plan period (1996-2000).
</P>
<P>
The plant, originally designated to be in northeast China's
Liaoning Province, will be built in eastern China's Jiangsu
Province instead.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Jiangsu, a province with a double-digit
economic growth rate and limited coal and water resources, has
found power shortages an obstacle to economic development.
</P>
<P>
Jiangsu currently consumes 80 million tons of coal annually,
but it can only produce 10 million tons for its own use. Heavy
pressure on transportation and heavy pollution from coal burning
force the province to turn to nuclear power for help.
</P>
<P>
The new site of the plant, which will include two
1,000-megawatt reactors, is in the Pashantou area of Lianyungang,
on the shore of the Yellow Sea.
</P>
<P>
Located in the the city's Lianyun District, the site is 28 km
outside the Xinpu District, 33 km from the Haizhou District, and
five km from the Lianyungang Wharf.
</P>
<P>
Lying in an area between low hills and the shore, the broad
area has convenient traffic conditions and favorable geological
and seismic situations, said Chang Nan, vice director of the
Preparatory Office of the Lianyungang Nuclear Power Plant.
</P>
<P>
In the first phase, two Russia-made VVER-1000 reactors will be
installed in the plant, Chang said, adding that vacant space for
building another two or four generating units will also be
provided.
</P>
<P>
On October 31, a meeting was held to discuss the joint
construction of the Lianyungang plant. The meeting was attended by
China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC)'s president Jiang
Xinxiong and executive vice president Chen Zhaobo, Jiangsu's
provincial governor Zheng Silin and executive vice governor Ji
Yunshi, as well as officials from relevant departments.
</P>
<P>
Chang said the group has reached a consensus on issues
governing the legal person of the project, funding, negotiations
with Russia, and also on preliminary work.
</P>
<P>
In early March, the preliminary feasibility study report passed
the examination of the Ministry of Power Industry and CNNC.
</P>
<P>
At present, China is working on the feasibility study report
and conducting negotiations with Russia so that the nuclear power
project be launched as soon as possible, he said.
</P>
<P>
As for commercial affairs, Chinese and Russian experts have
basically reached a common understanding of the framework
contract. They have also expressed their wish to sign the
framework contract and initial the technical design contract at an
early date, the official revealed.

CAIRO, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian soccer club Arab
Contractors downed Sodigraf of Zaire 4-0 in the second leg to win
the African Cup Winners' Cup here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Aly Ashour found the net twice in the seventh and 56th minute,
while Mohamed Ouda also scored twice in the 24th and 73rd minute.
</P>
<P>
It was the Egyptian team's third success in the tournament but
their first continental trophy in 13 years.
</P>
<P>
The first leg in Kinshasa two weeks ago ended in a goalless
draw, giving Contractors a 4-0 win on aggregate as well.
</P>
<P>
Ashour fired Contractors ahead in the seventh minute with a
powerful free kick that Sodigraf's goalkeeper Nzambangisi Babale
let slip through his hands.
</P>
<P>
Another error by Babale allowed defender Ouda to score an easy
second goal in the 24th minute against the run of play.
</P>
<P>
Sodigraf paid for several squandered chances 11 minutes into
the second half when Ashour converted a penalty and Ouda chipped
a speculative effort in from the edge of the penalty area in the
73rd minute for the fourth.
</P>
<P>
Contractors goalkeeper Ahmed Saber made two fine saves in the
final 15 minutes to deny Sodigraf a consolation goal in the
half-empty Cairo stadium.
</P>
<P>
The victory was marred by attacks on a small contingent of
Zairian fans, who were pelted with stones by Egyptian fans from
the stands above them.

<HEADLINE> IFC Launches Two Greek Drachma Floating Rate Notes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 6 (Xinhua) -- The International Finance
Corporation (IFC) today announced the launching of a GRD 26.7
billion which is about 110 million U.S. dollars equivalent public
offering of floating rates notes (FRN).
</P>
<P>
The offering consists of two issues: one is a GRD 14.6 billion
FRN issue with a one time capital redemption of GRD 5.4 billion in
December 1998 and a final maturity in December 2000. The other is
a GRD 12.1 billion FRN issue maturing in April 1999. Both issues

</P>
<P>

the Greek capital markets. In November last year, IFC launched a
GRD 40 billion floating rate note issue. Besides, the corporation
also launched a fixed rate issue in April 1994 and another in July
1995 in the Greek market.

<HEADLINE> "Most Chinese Patients Satisfied With Hospital Services" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 90 percent of Chinese
patients who have been treated in domestic hospitals are satisfied
with the services there, according to the results of a five-year
survey released by the Ministry of Public Health here today.
</P>
<P>
"These statistics indicate that the majority of China's public
health workers are basically competent, and our efforts to foster
professional ethics among medical workers in recent years have
been quite successful," said a ministry official.
</P>
<P>
During the past five years the ministry has randomly selected
962 hospitals across the country, and conducted face-to-face
interviews with nearly 130,000 patients.
</P>
<P>
"Nearly 50 percent of the respondents were interviewed at home,
after they had been discharged," the official noted.
</P>
<P>
The survey showed that in terms of the doctors' service and
medical skills, the rate of patient satisfaction had respectively
risen from 86 and 75 percent in 1991 to 92.6 and 91.5 percent in
1995.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, more than 89 out of 100 patients in 1995 were pleased
with the nurses' performance, while the figure for 1991 was less
than 75 percent.
</P>
<P>
In recent years violations of professional ethics in China's
medical circles have drawn strong criticism from society at large.
</P>
<P>
People were most angry at doctors and nurses who solicit money
and gifts from the patients they treat, and medicine purchasers
who ask for sales commissions from pharmaceuticals factories.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Public Health issued two disciplinary circulars
in 1993 and 1995, respectively, to hospitals throughout the
country, in a bid to put an end to such misconduct.
</P>
<P>
It also organized a number of nationwide inspections and
examinations, and tried hard to complete an internal supervision
system.
</P>
<P>
A ministry official said that, after years of efforts, the
situation is now turning for the better, and medical workers are
earning praise from both the government and the public.
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed out that there are several serious problems
haunting the existing medical system in China, which include
unreasonable charges for medical services, and poor management of
the production, supply, sales and use of drugs.
</P>
<P>
"These are all factors that cause various types of misconduct
in medical circles," he said, adding that these problems can only
be solved by gradually deepening medical reform.
</P>
<P>
China currently has nearly 190,000 medical institutions and
more than 5.3 million medical workers.

</P>
<P>
Speaking at an on-going meeting on inviting foreign experts, Wu

</P>
<P>

this year, 15,000 of whom are working in cultural and educational
fields. Other experts are working in the fields of energy
resources, communications, telecommunications, electronics,

<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Serbian Information Minister
Aleksander Tijanic announced his resignation here on Friday while
peaceful demonstration continued in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
Tijanic said at a press conference that his resignation had
nothing to do with the on-going protest in the Belgrade streets
these days.
</P>
<P>
He said he handed in his resignation to the cabinet on Thursday
because of pressure being exerted on independent media.
</P>
<P>
But local observers say he was just a victim of public pressure
on the authorities to make compromise to ease the tension in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Ministry of Traffic and Communication canceled the
only independent radio station in the country, B 92, on December 3
but allowed the radio to resume its work two days later after
protests from both home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a massive protest rally was staged in central
Belgrade on Friday, the 17th consecutive day after the first
protest broke out on November 19.
</P>
<P>
The opposition coalition Zajedno, which organized the
demonstrations, again called on Serbian President Slobodan
Milosevic to step down and urged the government to recognize the
results of the second round of local elections held on November
17.
</P>
<P>
The protesters first marched in the streets, blowing whistles,
crying insults, throwing fire crackers and lighting candles in
front of the buildings of Serbian radio and television and
Politika daily.
</P>
<P>
Belgrade university students also protested at noon in the
center of Belgrade and then marched for two hours.

the death of three victims in the attack, including Mohamed Ben
Chaou, a 25-year-old Moroccan student who died in hospital after
being fatally wounded by the explosion.

"In these hard circumstances, I personally make myself
available for you to bring all necessary help to your compatriots
and to their families," the Agence France Presse (AFP) quoted de
Charette as saying in his message to Filali.
</P>

Another Moroccan and friend of Ben Chaou, Younes Slimane Nait,

<HEADLINE> Canada Softens Tax Rules on Foreign Assets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, December 6 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian government has
softened part of its proposed tax reporting rules on foreign
property as a result of bitter complaints from businesses and
immigrants.
</P>
<P>
Yet, the changes have not gone far enough as to meet the
demands of the two groups, reports said today.
</P>
<P>
Taxpayers must still disclose foreign investments worth over
100,000 Canadian dollars as of the 1996 tax year.
</P>
<P>
Many were disappointed that the government still left the
threshold at 100,000 dollars. "That's very low. People were
suggesting 500,000 or 1 million dollars," a lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
However, Canadian taxpayers will get an extra year to file
their papers, which gives people more time to gather their data.
</P>
<P>
It also gives those planning to leave Canada more time to avoid
the new rules, some people suggested.
</P>
<P>
The new rules have also cut penalties for failing to comply to
5 percent of the value of the undisclosed property from 10
percent.
</P>
<P>
According to Bill Lawlor, International tax partner at
accountants KPMG, the rules will be very tough to enforce because
people just don't want to report that much detail.
</P>
<P>
"These are the kinds of rules that can make crooks out of a lot
of people," Lawlor noted.

PARIS, December 6 (Xinhua) -- The presidents of four African
countries arrived this evening in the capital of the Central
African Republic, Bangui, on a mediation mission between President
Ange-Felix Patasse and the mutinous soldiers, reports from Bangui
said.
</P>
<P>
The presidents of Burkina Faso, Mali, Gabon and Chad directly
flew from the Burkinabe capital Ouagadougou to Bangui, on a
decision made by the leaders attending the 19th Franco-African
summit, which closed there today.
</P>
<P>
Fierce fighting broke out between the mutinous soldiers and
government forces backed by French troops in Bangui on Thursday,
in an escalation of the two-week long mutiny which has a tribal
background.
</P>
<P>
The mutinous soldiers, who are calling for the the
reimbursement of their pay arrears and want President Patasse to
step down, said today that they also welcomed the mediation by the
four African presidents, according to a report by the Agence

</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the United Nations today withdrew the staff of their
institutions from Bangui to the capital of Cote d'Ivoire, Abidjan.

French President Jacques Chirac made it clear today that France
does not intend to be involved in the interior conflict of the

<HEADLINE> UN Urges Eradication of Trafficking in Women </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 6 (Xinhua) -- UN Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali today said that the highly organized,
international trafficking in human beings, particularly young
women and girls, was an evil trade which could only be ended
through concerted national and international action.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the General Assembly in observance of International
Day for Abolition of Slavery, he said that tens of millions of
people all over the world today are living in slavery.
</P>
<P>
"In some countries, traditional slavery has still not
disappeared. In others, new forms such as debt bondage and forced
labor have become commonplace," he said.
</P>
<P>
The traffic in human beings has become a serious challenge to
the entire international community, as the traffic often leads to
prostitution, forced domestic service and pornography, he added.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that good intentions were not enough. They must be
translated into concrete measures, new legislation and an increase
in resources at the national and international levels.
</P>
<P>
General Assembly President Razali Ismail described the
persistence of the problem as a "reproach to our age" which was
nothing short of modern slavery and an affront to humanity.
</P>
<P>
Carme Sala Sansa, minister of Education, Youth and Sports of
Andorra said all forms of violence against women must cease:
economic, social, political, physical and sexual violence.
</P>
<P>
Ireland Ambassador John Campbell, speaking for the European
Union and also for 12 other countries, said the odious practice of
trafficking in persons, especially women and children, involved
consistent and systematic violations of human rights and
fundamental freedoms. There was a need for concerted national and
international action.
</P>
<P>
Felipe Mabilangan of Philippines said at the international
level, priority should be given to the ratification and
enforcement of international convention and instruments on human
rights.
</P>
<P>
Compared to the long negotiating process on a new treaty or
convention, it would be more useful just to amend the old 1949
Convention for the Suppression of Traffic in Persons and of the
Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others. The Convention could
be provided with a wider view of the problem, including forced
marriages and forced labor, and it should also have a monitoring
mechanism, he said.

<P>
ANKARA, December 6 (Xinhua) -- The Turkish citizens living in
the Atrushrefugee camp in northern Iraq are seeking help from
Iraq's Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) so as to facilitate their
return to Turkey, the semi-official Anatolia News Agency reported
here today.
</P>
<P>
The agency said that about 10,000 Turkish citizens left
Turkey and went to northern Iraq after the Gulf War and settled
in the Atrushrefugee camp under the auspices of the United
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
</P>
<P>
Turkey claims that these camps were controlled by the
outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which has been fighting
a 12-year-old separatist war for self-rule in southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The KDP headed by Massoud Barzani and Patriotic Union of
Kurdistan (PUK) led by Jalal Talabani agreed to close down the
Atrushrefugee camp during meetings held between the two rival
factions here in October and November.

<HEADLINE> Turkey, US Consider to Reduce Planes over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Turkey and the United States
are discussing to reduce the number of the planes patrolling
the no-fly zone in northern Iraq under the Operation Provide
Comfort (OPC), the Anatolia News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted a senior official close to the
Turkish-U.S. talks as saying that the number of the planes has
already been decreased, but it might be further reduced.
</P>
<P>
He said that the reduction of the land force under the OPC
plan and the transformation of the OPC into a "reconnaissance
force" was a "positive development" for Turkey.
</P>
<P>
"We would not allow OPC land force to return to northern
Iraq. The Americans have expressed the same opinion," the
official said.
</P>
<P>
The OPC force, comprising Turkish, U.S., British and French
troops, was established in 1991 in a bid to provide air
protection for the Iraqi Kurds living in northern Iraq in case
of a possible attack by Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
During the Turkish-U.S. talks, which started earlier this
week, the Turkish side demanded that its air force take part in
the reconnaissance flights over northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The future of the OPC force has led to different opinions
between Islamist Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan and Deputy
Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan said that the task of the OPC force had been
accomplished and should be disbanded, while Ciller strongly
supported the continuation of its existence on the Turkish
territories.
</P>
<P>
In its latest meeting, Turkey's National Security Council
declined to give the cabinet an advisory opinion on whether or
not to end the OPC mandate.
