Bush Compliments Gore on Lieberman
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   OXNARD, Calif. (AP) -- Republican presidential nominee George W. Bush
complimented Vice President Al Gore for a ''good pick'' in selecting Connecticut
Sen. Joseph Lieberman as his running mate. But as he began a three-day West
Coast campaign swing on Wednesday, the Texas governor added: ''Remember who is
going to be president. The race is between Al Gore and me.'' Bush also pledged
not to write off California as he suggested other Republican presidential
candidates -- including his father -- had done.

Dallas NAACP Head Quits on Remarks
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- The president of the Dallas branch of the NAACP resigned
Wednesday after he was suspended for criticizing Sen. Joseph Lieberman, the
first Jew on a major political party ticket. The official, Lee Alcorn, said on
Monday that Democratic presidential candidate Al Gore's selection of the
Connecticut senator as a vice presidential running mate was suspicious. The
comment sparked outrage from Jews and blacks. NAACP President Kweisi Mfume
suspended Alcorn on Wednesday morning, saying he found the comments about
Lieberman to be ''anti-Semitic and anti-NAACP.''

Two Killers Executed in Texas
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   HUNTSVILLE, Texas (AP) -- A pair of convicted killers, including a prisoner
described by death penalty foes as mentally retarded, were executed tonight in
Texas. The U.S. Supreme Court had declined to block either execution. Oliver
David Cruz was put to death for the 1988 abduction, rape and fatal stabbing of a
24-year-old woman at Kelly Air Force Base in San Antonio. Cruz's IQ tested as
low as 63. Brian Keith Roberson was executed for the 1986 stabbing deaths of a
couple in Dallas.

NY Governor Signs Sweeping Gun Law
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   GARDEN CITY, N.Y. (AP) -- Gov. George Pataki today signed into law a sweeping
gun-control bill that requires mandatory trigger locks, a sophisticated tracking
system for weapons and background checks at gun shows. ''This is something the
rest of the nation should take a look at,'' Pataki said. ''I hope this serves as
a model.'' With the new law, New York becomes the first state in the nation to
close a loophole in the federal Brady Law, which requires gun sales by federally
licensed firearms dealers to be accompanied by background checks.

Montana Wildfires Rage On
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   HAMILTON, Mont. (AP) -- More than 6 million acres of southwestern Montana
were closed to public use today as wildfires burned across 300,000 acres of the
state, destroying houses and driving hundreds of people from their homes.
Nationally, 70 large wildfires were burning across 992,000 acres. More than
20,000 firefighters are on the lines in the hot and dry West. The National
Interagency Fire Center in Idaho is recruiting up to 80 people from New Zealand
and Australia to join fire crews that already include firefighters from Canada
and Mexico.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A bald eagle has hatched in Washington, the first time in
a half-century that the national symbol is known to have nested in the nation's
capital. After receiving a tip from a resident who spotted a pair of eagles
flying around with branches and twigs in their beaks, federal wildlife officials
spotted them building the nest in January on National Park Service land, The
Washington Post reported on its Web site Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Finding Soldiers Said Top Priority  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL ALEXANDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) -- Pursuing reports of American soldiers
still alive a quarter-century after the end of the Vietnam War
remains the top priority even though 21,000 alleged sightings have
failed to pan out, a U.S. official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Robert L. Jones, deputy assistant secretary of defense for the
POW/Missing Persons Office, said all the reports have been
investigated. ''None has borne fruit,'' he said. ''There still
remains a lot of work to do in that area.''
</P>
<P>
   The number of reports has steadily shrunk since 1973, after
Vietnam said it returned all American prisoners of war, with only
one alleged sighting for all of last year, he told reporters at the
end of a four-day visit.
</P>
<P>
   Jones echoed the praise that Defense Secretary William Cohen
gave to Vietnam when he visited in March and toured a site where
U.S. military forsenic experts were working.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thank the Vietnamese government and people for everything
they have done,'' Jones said. ''We could not have had the success
we have had without their assistance.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington is urging Vietnam to conduct more unilateral
searches, particularly in central Vietnam where some of the
fiercest fighting took place. Those would supplement monthlong
joint operations now held five or six times each year.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said the U.S. presidential election would not affect
Washington's commitment to account for the 2,014 still listed as
MIA -- 1,514 in Vietnam; the rest in Cambodia, Laos and China.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our methods may change, but we will continue to seek missing
Americans until all of them are accounted for,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Since January 1993, 249 sets of remains have been repatriated
and returned to their families, including 28 since Jan. 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Vietnam has recovered the remains of 2,500 of its 300,000 MIAs
with U.S. assistance, including 800 in the past year after being
given access to U.S. military archives, Jones said.

<HEADLINE> Investigators probing cause of midair plane collision over New Jersey </HEADLINE>
By BRENDAN SCHURR
<TEXT>
<P>
   BURLINGTON TOWNSHIP, N.J. (AP) - The key to learning how two
small planes collided in midair over a neighborhood here, killing
all 11 on board, will be determining at what angle they met, a
federal aviation official said.
</P>
<P>
   National Transportation Safety Board investigator Robert Benzon
said specialists in radar, aircraft performance and operations will
join representatives from the U.S. Navy and from the plane
manufacturers in the probe.
</P>
<P>
   ''My main job is to talk to the witnesses to determine the angle
that the aircraft came together,'' Benzon said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, victims' families, a police department and a Navy
installation are grieving the loss of those killed in Wednesday's
early morning crash.
</P>
<P>
   Seven of the victims were civilian employees of the U.S. Navy.
Another was a police officer who also worked as a flight
instructor.
</P>
<P>
   The two planes collided over an upscale subdivision about 10
miles south of Trenton, sending wreckage hurtling into a garage and
setting the home ablaze. The couple who lived in the house escaped
unharmed and no injuries were reported on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Five bodies and the fuselage of one plane landed in the garage
of that house, and another victim fell through the roof of a garage
two blocks away, police said. Three more bodies fell from the sky
into nearby athletic fields, some still in their airplane seats.
The bodies of a flight instructor and student pilot from the second
plane fell into a soybean field, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Nicole Lambert, who lives near the crash site, said she saw
wreckage fall in a column of fire as debris scattered around her
home. One engine piece gouged a chunk into the street near her
driveway.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought someone was shooting birds,'' Lambert said. ''I
couldn't figure out why the little birds would keep falling. Then I
saw the big piece fall down and I knew it was a plane.''
</P>
<P>
   The planes did not carry flight recording devices commonly known
as ''black boxes,'' Benzon said. Complicating the investigation is
the fact that radar images do not give enough detail, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will take good old-fashioned detective work to determine
the angle,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Naval employees and two crew members were on a chartered
Piper Navajo from the Lakehurst Naval Air Engineering Station, said
State Police Maj. Barry Roberson. They were en route to the
Patuxent River Naval Air Station, Md.
</P>
<P>
   The second plane, a Piper Seminole from Northeast Philadelphia
Airport, carried a flight instructor and a student, officials said.
The instructor was identified as Craig Robinson, 28, of Hamilton
Township, Mercer County, who also was a nine-year veteran of the
Washington Township Police Department in Mercer County. He worked
as a flight instructor for Hortman Aviation. Owner Herb Hortman
said Robinson was an experienced pilot with between 1,800 and 2,000
hours of flying time.
</P>
<P>
   Hortman Aviation is located about two miles from Northeast
Philadelphia Airport, where Robinson and the student took off
Wednesday morning, according to the Federal Aviation
Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson is survived by his wife, Tara, and a 7-month-old son.
</P>
<P>
   The student, who was not immediately identified, was a licensed
pilot working toward his commercial license.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy identified its seven employees as: Angelo George of
Toms River, a program manager; Cynthia Kovacs of Robbinsville, a
mechanical engineer; Robert Polo of Barnegat, a logistics
management specialist; Michael Simodejka of Toms River, a logistics
management specialist; John Vail Jr. of Howell, a program manager;
John Zukow of Toms River, an engineering technician; and David
Dahlen, of Warminster, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   Crew members were identified as Daniel Groff and Joseph Mari,
employed by Patuxent Airways of California, Md.
</P>
<P>
   George, 39, managed engineering programs at the Lakehurst
facility, said a family friend, Dennis McCarthy.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was a wonderful son, friend, brother and father,'' McCarthy
said. Survivors include his wife and children, McCarthy said, but
he would not be more specific.
</P>
<P>
   Dahlen, 57, retired in 1989 after spending 26 years as a career
officer in the U.S. Navy, where he was a commander in the supply
corps. He then went to work for Information Spectrum Inc., a
defense contractor based in Annandale, Va., said co-worker Fran
Poole.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's hard to distill somebody's life in a few sentences, but
he was a good man. I know everybody says that, but when you really
think of a good man, you think of David. I've never seen him upset.
Whatever you asked him to do, he did. He was very friendly, one of
those good people.''
</P>
<P>
   Dahlen was an avid NASCAR fan, Poole said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He lived and breathed NASCAR. He was a die-hard Jeff Gordon
fan. But his first hobby was his family. He was a devoted father
and devoted grandfather. They were a very close-knit family.''
</P>
<P>
   Dahlen is survived by his wife, Gail; a daughter, Debbi Kirsch,
of Lansdale, Pa., and his 2-year-old grandson, Andrew Kirsch.
</P>
<P>
   A woman who answered the home at the Simodejka home Wednesday
evening declined to talk to a reporter.
</P>
<P>
   A woman who answered the phone at the Polo residence said it was
''not a good time to talk.''
</P>
<P>
   The occupants of the house that was hit by the falling wreckage
ran out as it caught fire. Homeowner Ed Trzaskawka said he was in
bed, and his wife, Cathy, had just gotten out of the shower when
the plane plunged into their garage.
</P>
<P>
   ''I heard a loud explosion, then a roar and the house shook,
then immediately ignited,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Christie Whitman visited the home hours after the crash.
Cathy Trzaskawka is a former employee in the governor's office.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you can look for a bright side to all this, it is a miracle
no one on the ground was hurt. It's a miracle they survived,''
Whitman said.

<HEADLINE> Bears' Jaeger Return Short-Lived  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PLATTEVILLE, Wis. (AP) -- Jeff Jaeger's second stint with the
Chicago Bears lasted just two days.
</P>
<P>
   The Bears reached an injury settlement with the veteran kicker
on Wednesday, and Jaeger said he will go home to heal. The team
would not release the terms of the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Jaeger, who spent most of the 1999 season on injured reserve
with a hip injury, was brought in Monday by his former team to
compete with rookie Paul Edinger and second-year pro Jaret Holmes.
</P>
<P>
   However, Jaeger pulled a muscle on his left side in warmups
Tuesday morning, an injury that was expected to keep him out the
remainder of the preseason.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a tough deal for us all,'' Bears vice president of
player personnel Mark Hatley said Wednesday. ''We hoped that Jeff
could come in and compete for the job with the other two kickers,
but it didn't work that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Jaeger, a 13-year veteran, said it was a tough decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''After what I went through last year, my first reaction was to
throw my hands up and say, 'I quit,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hatley urged Jaeger, who kicked for the Bears from 1996-99, to
reconsider. Jaeger thought about it some more and decided it was
best for both himself and the team to cut the cord.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm just going to go home and be with my wife and kids, get
healed,'' Jaeger said. ''We'll see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bears are talking about re-signing veteran Michael Husted,
whom they cut to make room for Jaeger. In the meantime, Hatley is
encouraged by what he saw from Edinger and Holmes in last
Saturday's 20-8 exhibition victory over the New York Giants.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're stepping up to the plate in the competition,'' Hatley
said. ''I've been real pleased with them. We'll continue to look to
see what's available.''
</P>
<P>
   Jaeger, who ranks ninth among active NFL players with 1,008
points, joined the Bears in 1996 and set the club's season record
for field-goal percentage (.826).
</P>
<P>
   He became the first kicker in team history to make more than 80
percent of his field goal attempts in three consecutive seasons
(1996-98) and is an impressive 29-of-36 (80.5 percent) at Soldier
Field.
</P>
<P>
   Before coming to Chicago, Jaeger led the Raiders in scoring for
seven years. He was voted to the Pro Bowl in 1991 after scoring 116
points, fourth best in the NFL. He is one of 26 players in NFL
history to reach 1,000 career points.
</P>
<P>
   ''If this were the end of his career, he had an awfully good
one,'' Bears coach Dick Jauron said. ''So you can't feel too bad
for him.''

<HEADLINE> Montana Wildfires Rage On  </HEADLINE>
By TOM LACEKY
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAMILTON, Mont. (AP) -- More than 6 million acres of southwestern
Montana were closed to public use Wednesday as wildfires burned
across 300,000 acres of the state, destroying houses and driving
hundreds of people from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ''We would not do this if it were not absolutely essential,''
Gov. Marc Racicot said. ''This is devastating.''
</P>
<P>
   Montana's 19 largest fires Wednesday had scorched 300,000 acres.
The fires are concentrated in the Bitterroot Valley, where at least
52 homes have burned and more than 970 people have had to evacuate.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, 70 large wildfires were burning across 992,000
acres. More than 20,000 firefighters are on the lines in the hot
and dry West.
</P>
<P>
   The National Interagency Fire Center in Idaho is recruiting up
to 80 people from New Zealand and Australia to join fire crews that
already include firefighters from Canada and Mexico. It is
uncertain when they will arrive and where they would be assigned,
said Neal Hitchcock, a manager at the center.
</P>
<P>
   In Oregon, Gov. John Kitzhaber declared a state of emergency
Wednesday, allowing National Guard troops to be called for
firefighting duty. As many as 400 troops were expected to be called
to duty over the next two weeks to be trained to fight fires.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's vital we be ready with additional firefighters should the
need arise,'' Kitzhaber said.
</P>
<P>
   A 26,700-acre fire in Idaho's Nez Perce National Forest burned
along a mile and a half of the Salmon River and threatened to jump
the river, which is about 100 yards wide near McCall.
</P>
<P>
   If the fire crossed the river, historic cabins and rock art
could be threatened.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Armstrong, archaeologist for the forest, said three cabins
were wrapped in fire-resistant materials. The numerous historic
sites along the river include 1,000 pieces of rock art that depict
birds and fish and hunting posts. Some are much as 8,000 years old.
</P>
<P>
   In Montana, Racicot said the closure of between 6 million and 8
million acres of state, private, tribal and federal land was
necessary to prevent additional fires and to reduce the chance that
people using forested lands could be trapped by wildfires.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's announcent forbids hiking, fishing and all other
activities on state land beginning Friday unless a permit is
obtained. Only homeowners who must cross the lands to reach their
homes are exempt.
</P>
<P>
   In Colorado's Mesa Verde National Park, a 5,000-acre fire that
threatened ancient cliff dwellings was more than 50 percent
contained Wednesday night, and incident commander Mike Lohrey
expected full containment Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's looking good, but nobody's letting down their guard,''
said park spokesman Will Morris.

<HEADLINE> In Texas, a pair of executions  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL GRACZYK
<TEXT>
<P>
   HUNTSVILLE, Texas (AP) - One was repentant. The other defiant.
</P>
<P>
   Two condemned killers, both high on drugs when they committed
their crimes, received a lethal dose of drugs 33 minutes apart in
back-to-back executions Wednesday evening in the nation's busiest
death chamber.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of one of the inmates, Oliver David Cruz, 33, said
the man convicted of abducting, raping and fatally stabbing a
24-year-old woman stationed at Kelly Air Force Base in San Antonio
was mentally retarded and should not have been put to death
Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   But the U.S. Supreme Court, which has allowed some three dozen
mentally ill or retarded prisoners to be executed in this country
over the past two decades, refused to stop Cruz's lethal injection.
</P>
<P>
   Just over a half-hour earlier, another inmate, Brian Keith
Roberson, 36, was executed in an identical procedure for the 1986
stabbing deaths of an elderly couple who lived across the street
from him in Dallas. The high court also had refused to stop his
punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Sobbing and teary-eyed, Cruz asked for forgiveness from his
victim's family and his own family and apologized for the 1988
slaying that sent him to death row.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm sorry for what I did to her 12 years ago,'' he said just
before the lethal drugs took effect. ''Take me home, Jesus,'' he
cried.
</P>
<P>
   A tear ran down his face several moments after he stopped
breathing.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorneys said Cruz's IQ tested as low as 63, seven
points below what is considered mildly retarded, although Bexar
County prosecutors showed his IQ at 83 when he arrived at the Texas
Department of Criminal Justice in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   The twin lethal injections marked the first multiple executions
in Texas in three years. State officials noted execution dates are
set by district judges at the local level and the double execution
Wednesday was coincidental. On Feb. 8, 1924, the electric chair was
used for the first time in Texas and five convicted killers were
executed that single night.
</P>
<P>
   While Cruz's mental retardation claims gave him some notoriety,
the attention paid to the two inmates paled in comparison to the
noisy hoopla that drew the hundreds of protesters and media to
Huntsville in June for the lethal injection of Gary Graham.
</P>
<P>
   Graham's claims of innocence and an unfair trial spotlighted
Texas as the nation's execution capital and support of the death
penalty by Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican presidential
nominee.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday evening, about 100 demonstrators were stationed
outside the Huntsville Unit prison. Many of them prayed. A few
carried signs critical of Bush. During Cruz's punishment, many of
them cried. One fainted.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Board of Pardons and Parole refused by identical 18-0
votes to recommend to Bush that he halt Wednesday's executions, the
27th and 28th in Texas this year.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly Donovan, a senior airman from Rumson, N.J., who worked as
a linguist at Kelly Air Base, was taking a walk the night of Aug.
7, 1988, when she was abducted by Cruz and Jerry Kemplin, who were
driving home after a drinking party. She was raped by Cruz, who
then stabbed her to death.
</P>
<P>
   Cruz blamed the attack on drug use that began for him at age 13.
He said he and Kemplin, who testified against him in exchange for a
65-year prison term, had taken LSD and drank ''a couple of bottles
of liquor.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the 25 states that allow the execution of retarded
killers, some are considering laws stopping it. The Texas
Legislature, which killed a bill last session outlawing the
execution of someone whose IQ is below 65, will revisit the issue
next year.
</P>
<P>
   In the Dallas case, Roberson was rebellious at the end and used
a vulgarity to wind up his last statement.
</P>
<P>
   ''To all the racist white folks in America that hate black folks
and to all the black folks in America that hate themselves ...
y'all kiss my black ass,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Roberson fatally stabbed James Boots, 79, and Boots' wife,
Lillian, 75, during a home robbery.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wasn't in a solid frame of mind,'' he said when arrested,
blaming the attack on his use of PCP and liquor. ''I was just
juiced up.''
</P>
<P>
   Janice Warder, who helped prosecute the case in Dallas County,
said Roberson had a history of being a bully. It was the same
tactic he used on his murder victims.
</P>
<P>
   ''I do regret that family has had to wait this long to have some
closure,'' said Warder, now a state district judge in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ''This has brought closure to this grim and gruesome
situation,'' said Randy Fleming, grandson of Roberson's victims,
and one of the people who watched Roberson die.

   The peaceful demonstration through downtown to Congress
coincided with the end a two-week-long march by hundreds of workers
that began in Rosario, a port city located about 200 miles
northwest of Buenos Aires.
</P>
<P>
   The marchers stopped in more than 15 cities along the way,
seeking signatures for a petition demanding a $380 monthly subsidy
for unemployed heads of family.
</P>
<P>
   State workers unions and other labor groups joined Wednesday's
rally, denouncing a recent cutback in their salaries by more than
12 percent. The government says the reduction was needed to trim a
federal deficit by $2.5 billion this year.
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Gonzalez, a 28-year-old teacher, said he was struggling to
make ends meet with his $700-a-month salary. ''They should raise
salaries to reactivate the economy,'' he said angrily.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the signs waved by demonstrators blasted the
International Monetary Fund. Argentina's must meet the IMF's
financial targets to maintain access to loans. ''Money for food,
education, and health -- not the IMF!'' read one placard.
</P>
<P>
   The government reported last month that unemployment stood at
15.4 percent, up from 13.8 percent last October. The news was a
blow to the government of President Fernando De La Rua, which has
repeatedly said that an economic recovery is forthcoming.

<HEADLINE> Bald Eagle Hatched in Washington  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A bald eagle has hatched in Washington, the
first time in a half-century that the national symbol is known to
have nested in the nation's capital.
</P>
<P>
   After receiving a tip from a resident who spotted a pair of
eagles flying around with branches and twigs in their beaks,
federal wildlife officials spotted them building the nest in
January on National Park Service land, The Washington Post reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In March, the female eagle was sitting on the nest, and in April
a chick hatched. It has been flying on its own since late June.
Now, the eaglet and its parents still spend time near the nest, but
not in it.
</P>
<P>
   Wildlife officials are thrilled because eagles have a reputation
for being fussy about where they live. Until recently, scientists
had thought eagles would not nest in developed areas.
</P>
<P>
   The eaglet, which will not develop the species' distinctive
white head feathers for several years, is the first bald eagle
known to be hatched in the city since the late 1940s, according to
the National Park Service. After that, loss of habitat and
widespread use of the pesticide DDT, which weakened eagle eggs so
that they were crushed in the nest, caused the population in the
lower 48 states to plummet.
</P>
<P>
   The bird's numbers began rising after DDT was banned in 1972,
and the Clinton administration is close to removing the bald eagle
from the endangered species list.

<HEADLINE> L.A., Vegas Train Plan Delayed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The start of high-speed passenger trains
between Los Angeles and Las Vegas will be delayed at least a year
while permits for track construction and rail cars are pending.
</P>
<P>
   Amtrak had planned to start service next month, with one train
leaving Los Angeles for Las Vegas each morning and returning each
evening.
</P>
<P>
   But construction of about 20 miles of tracks in the Mojave
Desert, which would take about 10 months, needs approval from the
National Park Service and Fish and Wildlife agency before work can
begin. The agencies are concerned about the impact on desert
tortoise habitat.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've got the equipment, and the money in hand, in order to
ensure a 5&AMP;frac12;- to 6-hour run time,'' Liz O'Donoghue, spokeswoman for
Oakland-based Amtrak West, said Wednesday. In the past, passenger
trains made the 300-mile trip in about seven hours.
</P>
<P>
   Also needing Federal Railroad Administration approval is the
planned use of 14 Spanish-designed rail cars. The cars, in use the
past four years in the Pacific Northwest by Amtrak, do not meet the
specifics of new federal crash-safety standards adopted last year,
The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe they do meet the new standards. We believe they are
just as safe,'' O'Donoghue said Wednesday. Amtrak has filed a
request with the FRA to grant an exemption for the cars.
</P>
<P>
   Amtrak estimates the Los Angeles-Las Vegas route would carry
62,000 people in its first year and grow to 100,000 by the third
year.

<HEADLINE> GOP to Counter DNC Online  </HEADLINE>
By D. IAN HOPPER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Look out Al Gore and Joseph Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   In a strike matching an earlier one by the Democratic National
Committee, the GOP may return fire in what's shaping up to be a
presidential war of Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the Republican National Committee reserved the sites,
AlandJoe.com and AlandJoe.org -- named for Gore, who next week
becomes the Democratic nominee for president, and running mate
Lieberman, a senator from Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Neither site is up and running, but they won't spread good news
about the Democratic duo.
</P>
<P>
   RNC deputy chief of staff Larry Purpuro registered the sites,
but he wouldn't divulge his plans for them to ''the opposition'' or
say when they would go online. But he did have some harsh words
Wednesday for the DNC's earlier production, calling it ''an attempt
to mislead.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic National Committee has paid for and authorized
Bush-Cheney.net, a site critical of Republican vice presidential
nominee Dick Cheney's voting record when he served in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not in the business of trying to fool the public with
impostor Web sites,'' Purpuro said.
</P>
<P>
   The RNC registered PhonyAlGore.com and BureaucratsForGore.com
earlier this year, though neither are functional.
</P>
<P>
   A Gore campaign spokesman did not return a telephone call
Wednesday for comment.
</P>
<P>
   When Republicans went shopping for Web addresses, they found
slim pickings. All possible combinations of the Democratic
candidates' names had been taken by private citizens.
</P>
<P>
   LiebermanGore.com is owned by Wisconsin resident Chris
Demarinis, Texan Kevin Wood has GoreLieberman2000.com and
GoreLieberman.com belongs to David Jackson of Skokie, Ill.,
according to public registration records.
</P>
<P>
   But Jackson, a 20-year-old University of Maryland student, is
giving his domain to the Gore campaign for free, the Washington
Post reported in its Thursday editions.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the best domain name that has a combination of these
men's names, and it is the one we wanted,'' Ben Green, Gore's
Internet director, told the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Pete Lucas of Bridgewater, N.J., spent a pile of money -- it
costs about $70 to register a single Web address -- to reserve a
long list of potential sites, including GoreLieberman.org,
Gore-Lieberman2000.com, Gore-Lieberman2000.org and
GoreLieberman2000.org.
</P>
<P>
   He also hedged his bets by grabbing GoreBayh.org and
GoreKerry.com. Sens. Evan Bayh of Indiana and John Kerry of
Massachusetts also were on Gore's short list of candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Messages left Wednesday at Lucas's listed number were not
immediately returned.
</P>
<P>
   He isn't the only one who gambled on another vice presidential
possibility, however.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the other Bayh and Kerry possibilities are taken, and
GoreMitchell.com -- for former Maine Sen. George Mitchell -- is
reserved, too. But only GoreMitchell.com shows anything to viewers
-- bouncing them to Republican George W. Bush's presidential
campaign site, at georgewbush.com.

Montana Wildfires Rage On
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   HAMILTON, Mont. (AP) -- More than 6 million acres of southwestern Montana
were closed to public use Wednesday as wildfires burned across 300,000 acres of
the state, destroying houses and driving hundreds of people from their homes.
Montana's 19 largest fires Wednesday had scorched 300,000 acres. The fires are
concentrated in the Bitterroot Valley, where at least 52 homes have burned and
more than 970 people have had to evacuate. Nationally, 70 large wildfires were
burning across 992,000 acres. More than 20,000 firefighters are on the lines in
the hot and dry West.

<HEADLINE> Group Asks Gore's Help to Stop Gala  </HEADLINE>
By MICHELLE DeARMOND
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A Catholic group is asking Vice President Al
Gore to use his clout to cancel a Hispanic political action
committee fund-raiser next week at the Playboy Mansion.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is not attending the Hispanic Unity USA gala Tuesday but
the Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights wants him to use
his influence with Rep. Loretta Sanchez, D-Calif., the event's
chairman, to stop it.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has the ability spike this event,'' William Donohue,
president of the New York-based Catholic group, said Wednesday.
''If someone in my organization was out campaigning, doing
something untoward, believe me, I'd have that man or woman in here
saying 'knock it off.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Catholic League says Playboy founder Hugh Hefner and his
daughter have made disparaging remarks about the church and Playboy
Enterprises has supported Catholics for a Free Choice, an abortion
rights organization.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Meier, speaking for Gore, said the event is not part of
the Democratic National Convention opening Monday and the vice
president does not control it. Gore said earlier he would not
attend and does not condone the gala.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's campaign, meanwhile, has threatened to punish Sanchez if
she does not cancel the fund-raiser, the Washington Post reported
Thursday, citing Democratic sources.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Daley, Gore's campaign manager, warned Sanchez in a
telephone call this week that she could lose her convention
credentials, a speaking role at the gathering and even her position
as a general co-chair of the Democratic National Committee by going
ahead with the party, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has begun to highlight moral values on the campaign trail
and, this week, he named Sen. Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut as
his running mate. Lieberman, an observant Orthodox Jew, was a
strong critic of President Clinton's relationship with White House
intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Playboy spokesman Bill Farley said he's never heard the Hefners
say anything anti-Catholic. He said Playboy's magazine and
foundation have consistently supported abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   ''I could see how some religious groups ... would take exception
to our position,'' Farley said.
</P>
<P>
   But he said the gala is a bipartisan event over which Gore
should not exercise any influence.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Playboy Mansion for a political event is not Sodom and
Gomorrah,'' he said. ''It is in many respects like a five-star
hotel.''

<HEADLINE> Reports Sees China Nuke Buildup  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A new U.S. intelligence report predicts China
would accelerate its nuclear arms buildup if the United States
erected a national defense against long-range missiles.
</P>
<P>
   The prediction, in a classified report known as a National
Intelligence Estimate, was disclosed Wednesday by U.S. officials
speaking on condition of anonymity. They said it is part of a
broader assessment of how foreign countries might respond to a U.S.
decision to go ahead with a national missile defense,
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has said he would decide soon whether to
authorize the initial steps toward deploying a network of missile
interceptors, missile-tracking radars and battle management
computers to defend all 50 states against a small-scale nuclear
attack. China is among the few nations capable of a nuclear strike
on the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In making his decision, Clinton has said he would take into
account four main factors: the urgency of the missile threat, the
cost of a missile defense, the feasibility of building a reliable
defense and the implications for U.S. foreign policy, including
responses from China and other nations.
</P>
<P>
   China and Russia are strongly opposed to the U.S. plan, arguing
it would undercut the deterrent value of their nuclear arsenals,
violate the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty and undermine global
stability. As well, many U.S. allies in Europe are leery.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and his national security aides have tried, with little
apparent success, to convince China's leaders that a U.S. national
missile defense would not be directed against China's nuclear
missile capability. A defensive system, they contend, would be for
''rogue'' nations like North Korea and Iran that are pursuing
intercontinental ballistic missile technologies and might not be
deterred by U.S. nuclear threats.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, an unclassified CIA report released Wednesday said
China increased its missile technology assistance to Pakistan last
year and also had a hand in missile development in North Korea,
Iran and Libya. The report said, ''The Chinese have taken a very
narrow interpretation of their nonproliferation commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   The spread of missile technology is at the heart of the Clinton
administration's justification for developing a missile defense.
</P>
<P>
   The fear is not only of an attack but also of the possibility
that a country like Iraq -- if armed with a missile capable of
striking a U.S. city -- might try to use the threat of an attack to
persuade the United States to stay out of a regional crisis such as
a conflict in the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials who are familiar with the classified intelligence
report said it states that China plans to increase its nuclear
arsenal regardless of U.S. national missile defense plans. However,
it adds that the increase likely would be sped up if a missile
defense were built.
</P>
<P>
   ''Would they probably accelerate it? Yes,'' said one official.
</P>
<P>
   Additions to China's nuclear arsenal probably would be modest,
the report said, and designed to give China a numerical edge over
the U.S. missile defense system, which in its initial configuration
might overcome a couple of dozen incoming missiles.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA said last year that China has about 20 long-range
nuclear missiles capable of reaching any part of U.S. territory. It
said then that China was likely to test within the next several
years a longer range missile capable of being fired from a mobile
platform, and that it would be targeted mainly at the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   The classified report also affirms an intelligence estimate of
September 1999 that the United States most likely will face a
missile threat by 2015 from North Korea, probably from Iran and
possibly from Iraq, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The report also predicts Russia would continue shrinking its
nuclear force, which has been eroded in recent years by a lack of
money. Russian officials have warned that they would feel compelled
to respond to a U.S. missile defense, possibly by withdrawing from
major arms control agreements.

<HEADLINE> Report: Elderly Living Longer  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL RECER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- There are more Americans aged 65 or older than
any time in history, and they are living longer, healthier and in
more comfort.
</P>
<P>
   But, by some measures, up to one in four elderly Americans in
some racial and ethnic groups are not sharing equally in this
better life.
</P>
<P>
   Those are the conclusions in a report released Thursday that
summarizes data on elderly Americans collected from nine federal
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ''People are living longer and living more of their life in
better health than before,'' said Richard Suzman, an expert at the
National Institute on Aging, the lead agency in assembling the
report.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge, he said, is to keep up that trend of improvement
and to spread the benefits more equally among all races and ethnic
groups.
</P>
<P>
   Suzman said the report should help policy-makers brace for the
old-age arrival of the baby boomers, a population wave that will
create ''an enormous stretch'' of society's health and elder care
services.
</P>
<P>
   The study, ''Older Americans 2000: Key Indicators of
Well-Being,'' compiles for the first time statistics from various
agencies ''to provide a unified picture of the overall health and
well-being of older Americans, said Katherine K. Wallman, chief
statistician of the Office of Management and Budget.
</P>
<P>
   ''I see a very positive picture, but clearly problems do
remain,'' said Dr. Edward J. Sondik, director of the National
Center for Health Statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Among the report's findings:
</P>
<P>
   --There are approximately 35 million people in the United States
age 65 or older, accounting for about 13 percent of the total
population. In 1900, the number of older Americans was about 3.1
million.
</P>
<P>
   --With the aging of baby boomers -- those people born between 1946
and 1964 -- America's older population will double by 2030, reaching
some 70 million.
</P>
<P>
   --Life expectancy for Americans age 65 in 2000 is 18 years, on
average. In 1900, 65-year-olds could expect to live, on average, an
additional 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   --In 1998, women accounted for 58 percent of those over 65 and 70
percent of those 85 or older. About 41 percent of the older women
live alone.
</P>
<P>
   --The older population will become more ethnically and racially
diverse, the study predicts. Of those age 65 or older now, about 84
percent are non-Hispanic whites. By 2050, that number will be 64
percent.
</P>
<P>
   --From 1959 to 1998, the percentage of older Americans living in
poverty declined from 35 percent to 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
   --The median net worth in households headed by older people
increased from 1984 to 1999 by 70 percent, but there is a gaping
disparity between races. In 1999, the median net worth in
households headed by older black people was $13,000, compared with
$181,000 for older white householders.
</P>
<P>
   --There was a wide difference in the rates of poverty between
racial and ethnic groups for Americans 65 and older. In 1998, the
percentage of non-Hispanic whites living in poverty was 8.2,
compared with 26.4 percent for non-Hispanic blacks, 16 percent for
non-Hispanic Asian and Pacific Islanders and 21 percent for
Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   --Heart disease, cancer and stroke are the big three killers.
Mortality rates for heart disease and stroke have declined by a
third since 1980, while the rate for cancer has gone up slightly.
</P>
<P>
   --The rate of chronic disability among older Americans declined
from 24 percent in 1982 to 21 percent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   --About 4 percent of the population 65 and older, some 1.46
million people, were in nursing homes in 1997. About 192 out of
every 1,000 people aged 85 or older were in nursing homes in 1997.
The rate for this group in 1985 was 220 per 1,000.
</P>
<P>
   --A survey of Americans age 65 and older between 1994 and 1996
found that the vast majority considered themselves healthy. For
non-Hispanic whites, 74 percent considered themselves in good or
excellent health. For non-Hispanic blacks, the figure was 59.3
percent, while it was 64.9 percent for Hispanics.

<P>
   The decision allows her daughter, the president, to reorganize
the Cabinet ahead of elections.
</P>
<P>
   Bandaranaike, the mother of President Chandrika Kumaratunga, has
been a dominant force in Sri Lankan politics for four decades but
has been in ill health for months and had canceled most public
appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Bandaranaike set a pattern when she first assumed the
leadership of Sri Lanka in 1959. She was followed by the region's
most towering figure in the last 30 years -- male or female --
India's Indira Gandhi, who became prime minister in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   A stunned Sri Lankan Parliament was told that Bandaranaike's
post will be filled by Ratnasiri Wickramanayaka, minister of public
administration and home affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Born Sirimavo Ratwatte on April 17, 1916, into one of the Indian
Ocean island's wealthiest families, she was educated in a Catholic
convent and never intended to become a politician.
</P>
<P>
   In 1940 she married Soloman Dias Bandaranaike, a senior
politician in the United National Party which was then governing
the soon-to-be independent country, that used to be called Ceylon.
</P>
<P>
   After breaking away to form his own Sri Lanka Freedom Party,
Soloman Bandaranaike was elected prime minister in 1956.
</P>
<P>
   A deranged Buddhist monk assassinated him three years later.
</P>
<P>
   Bandaranaike, who had stayed out of the limelight, found the
mantel of party leadership thrust upon her. She rode a wave of
public sympathy to a landslide victory at the next election in
1960, becoming prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   She governed until 1965, lost the next elections, then regained
power in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1972, Bandaranaike made the country a republic.
</P>
<P>
   In her second term, she nationalized private companies. Imports
were banned and many Sri Lankans still remember the long queues for
bread and rationing of basic necessities such as rice and cloth.
</P>
<P>
   She used the military to ruthlessly crush a 1971 insurrection by
Marxist rebels. Estimates of the number of people killed range up
to 20,000.
</P>
<P>
   With the crushing of the rebellion, Bandaranaike's popularity
began to wane. The small Marxist parties who were part of her
coalition government began to desert her.
</P>
<P>
   When elections were finally held in 1977, her party was reduced
to a mere eight seats in the 157-member Parliament, down from 90 in
1970.
</P>
<P>
   Bandaranaike managed to win her own seat from her hometown,
Attanagalla, 22 miles northeast of Colombo. But in 1980, Parliament
expelled her, accusing her of misusing power while prime minister,
and banned her from holding public office for seven years.
</P>
<P>
   Her civic rights were restored in 1986, in time for the next
elections in 1988. By then the country had changed to a French
style of government, with most power residing in an executive
presidency. Bandaranaike narrowly lost the election for president.
</P>
<P>
   Suffering from diabetes, and repeatedly undergoing minor surgery
to correct a bone problem on her left foot, Bandaranaike reduced
her political activities.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993 her daughter took over the party's leadership, although
Bandaranaike remained the party's official president.
</P>
<P>
   In November of 1994, the daughter, Kumaratunga was elected
president, and appointed her mother to what had become the largely
ceremonial prime minister's post.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Nomar Garciaparra hit a three-run homer
as the Boston Red Sox snapped a four-game losing streak with 4-2
victory Wednesday night over the Anaheim Angels.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Fassero (8-5) pitched into the sixth inning for only his
second win in nine starts since the end of June.
</P>
<P>
   With two outs in the third, Garciaparra lined the first pitch he
saw from rookie Matt Wise into the left-field bullpen for his 18th
homer, scoring Mike Lansing and Trot Nixon, who singled.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Lowe pitched the final two innings for his 25 save in 30
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra's first hit in nine at-bats in the series
overshadowed Tim Salmon's 26th homer in the sixth, which cut
Boston's lead to 3-2. It was the 222nd homer of Salmon's career,
tying Brian Downing's franchise record.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Gant gave the Angels a 1-0 lead in the first with his third
homer in his last four at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   Fassero faced his biggest jam in the fifth, which began with a
double by Bengie Molina. Walks to Keith Johnson and Gant loaded the
bases with two outs for Mo Vaughn. Fassero retired the former
Boston slugger on a weak grounder to first.
</P>
<P>
   When Salmon led off the sixth with his milestone homer, Boston
manager Jimy Williams quickly removed Fassero in favor of Hipolito
Pichardo.
</P>
<P>
   Fassero allowed four hits and two runs. He walked three and
struck out five. Fassero was 1-3 in his previous eight starts,
averaging only four innings.
</P>
<P>
   Wise (0-1), who pitched three shutout innings of relief in his
first two big-league appearances, was sharp in his starting debut.
He allowed three runs on five hits.
</P>
<P>
   Wise, the Angels' sixth-round draft choice in 1997, was 9-6 with
a 3.69 ERA in 18 starts for Edmonton.
</P>
<P>
   Manny Alexander hit his a solo homer in the ninth, his second.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Gant's homer was the third of his career off Fassero. He
was 2-for-3 with a solo homer when Fassero faced the Phillies on
June 4. ... Vaughn went 3-for-5 in the series opener, including his
first homer against the Red Sox, but was 0-for-7 in the final two
games. He is 7-for-43 in his career against Boston. ... Salmon has
eight homers and 20 RBIs in his last 19 games. ... Boston went 23
consecutive innings without a run-scoring hit until Garciaparra's
homer. The Red Sox's first two runs of the series scored on infield
grounders.

<HEADLINE> Connecticut Democrats welcome Lieberman and Gore  </HEADLINE>
By MATTHEW DALY
<TEXT>
<P>
   STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) - It seems like everyone in Joe Lieberman's
hometown has a story to tell about his nice manners, his integrity
or his down-to-earth style.
</P>
<P>
   Some who turned out to watch him in his first Connecticut speech
as Al Gore's vice presidential running mate said they like
Lieberman so much they may even cross party lines to vote for him.
</P>
<P>
   Dorothy Frantin, 68, said she is a Republican, but is leaning
toward voting for the Gore-Lieberman ticket because she admires
Lieberman. The two-term senator is known for his stands against
violence and sex in the entertainment industry, and his public
rebuke of President Clinton in the Monica Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need somebody like that, after the administration we've
had,'' she said. ''As a matter of fact, I wish he was running for
president.''
</P>
<P>
   Donna Tuck, the Democratic first selectman in the town of
Sherman, said her husband, a Republican, giggled with delight when
he heard that Gore had chosen Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   ''He said he thought the Democrats would win now. Even he said
he might vote for Gore-Lieberman,'' Tuck said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Lieberman appeared together Wednesday at the Italian
Center of Stamford, where more than 1,000 people listened as Gore
introduced a ''son of Stamford'' to a raucous crowd in the city
where Lieberman grew up.
</P>
<P>
   As the pair's motorcade drove by Lieberman's mother's home,
Lucas Isidro, a 55-year-old Stamford police officer, put up a 4
foot by 8 foot American flag.
</P>
<P>
   ''I love Joe Lieberman,'' he said. ''I'm very proud of him. I
think he stands for everything I believe in - the American dream,
home, family values, integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside the overflowing banquet room, the rally had the feel of a
rock concert, and those attending waited in lines up to a half-hour
long just to get inside.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, who was introduced by Vida Lionetti, his former high
school girlfriend, appeared choked up as he spoke about being back
home.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel like the homecoming king,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman's speech was briefly interrupted by a Ralph Nader
supporter, who held up a Nader for President sign and called the
election a ''sham.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman replied that he also is a fan of Nader, whom he called
''another son of Connecticut.'' Lieberman said he admires Nader, a
Winsted native, ''in general, but not in particular in this
election.''
</P>
<P>
   Police led the man away and Lieberman resumed speaking.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman's elevation to Gore's running mate has energized
Connecticut politics, particularly as the fate of Lieberman's
Senate seat remains uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   Under state law, Lieberman can run for both offices
simultaneously, and he has said he intends to do so. If elected
vice president he would have to resign from the Senate and
Republican Gov. John G. Rowland would appoint a replacement, who
would serve until the next statewide election in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   But Lieberman could also quit the race as late as Oct. 27 and
still be replaced by a Democratic Party nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats at the rally made a point of saying they want
Lieberman to run for both offices.
</P>
<P>
   ''Connecticut residents will be honored to have the opportunity
to vote twice for Joe,'' said Attorney General Richard Blumenthal,
who is considered the leading Democrat to replace Lieberman if he
decides not to run.

<HEADLINE> Lieberman a leader at early age  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN CHRISTOFFERSEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   Joe Lieberman was a teen-ager when a major controversy erupted
over a proposal to end summer school in Stamford, Conn., more than
40 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, class president at Stamford High School, led his
classmates to the Board of Education to successfully convince them
not to end the program, recalled Martin Levine, a current school
board member who attended Stamford High a few years before
Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   ''They caused summer school to happen,'' Levine said. ''That was
real leadership right from the start.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman's selection as the first Jewish vice presidential
candidate from a major party did not surprise his classmates.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think there were people at the time who said he could be the
first Jewish president,'' Levine said. ''He had a presence about
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Classmates and friends say Lieberman's integrity, friendliness
and intelligence made him a natural leader.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was always the guy to placate everyone,'' said Genaro
Rubino. ''Joe was always a leader. Very mild mannered, but always a
leader.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubino vividly remembers the junior prom, when Lieberman, his
date and a few other couples insisted on walking several miles
because it was the Jewish Sabbath.
</P>
<P>
   ''That stuck out in my mind that he had such strong beliefs,
even then,'' Rubino said, noting that Lieberman was about 16 at the
time. ''I have to believe religion has something to do with his
character and his intelligence.''
</P>
<P>
   Anna Schmid, another classmate, first voted for Lieberman in the
9th grade when he was class president.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was so well spoken, even as a child,'' Schmid said. '' You
just had that feeling he would be something some day.''
</P>
<P>
   Schmid recalled Lieberman asking her 10 years ago at a reunion
if it was possible for a Jewish candidate to be president.
</P>
<P>
   ''I said 'yes Joe, and if you decide to run, you have my vote,'
'' Schmid said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton puts in good word for vice president, first lady  </HEADLINE>
By CLAUDE R. MARX
<TEXT>
<P>
   McLEAN, Va. (AP) - President Clinton did some stumping for his
vice president and his wife Wednesday night, saying the best way to
ensure continued prosperity was to send Al Gore to the White House
and Hillary Rodham Clinton to the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ''This election is a very big deal,'' the president told 30
people who paid $10,000 each to help Mrs. Clinton's campaign for
the Senate from New York. ''How you use your prosperity is as
important a test as how you deal with a crisis. You have to go
around and convince people of that.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he was ''flattered'' that some Republicans borrowed his
words at the party's convention last week but said their policies
are still the ones failed during the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a difference between changing the rhetoric and
changing the policies,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the ''clarity of choice'' in this fall's election
will help Democrats because people will realize which party has the
best policies.
</P>
<P>
   He said the major difference is that Democrats ''want us all to
go along for the ride'' and said their policies would enable the
people serving the meal to have the same chance to send their
children to college as those eating it.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton praised his wife for being an advocate of children's
issues before it became fashionable to do so. He added that she had
helped make Arkansas a role model in neonatal care while she was
first lady there.
</P>
<P>
   Electing her to the Senate would give her the chance to keep
working on these and other issues and support broader policies that
will keep the country's prosperity on track, Clinton noted.
</P>
<P>
   He praised Gore for being an early advocate of strong measures
to protecting the environment and of programs to make technology
more accessible.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spoke at the home of Al and Claire Dwoskin, who are
friends of the Clintons, at their home in McLean, an affluent
Washington suburb.
</P>
<P>
   Later, at a second $10,000-per person event for his wife,
Clinton said she has the ''best blend of mind and heart and
knowledge'' of anyone he knows. That event was at the Washington
home of Clinton's friend Tom Quinn.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Neb. Football Coach Eyes Congress  </HEADLINE>
By JESSICA FARGEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LEXINGTON, Neb. (AP) -- Two rough-and-tumble pastimes are going
hand-in-hand this year in Nebraska's sprawling 3rd Congressional
District: Football and politics.
</P>
<P>
   Retired University of Nebraska coach Tom Osborne has had little
trouble with name recognition in a pigskin-crazed district that
spans 65,000 square miles -- nearly 85 percent of the state's land
mass.
</P>
<P>
   Although he hadn't lived in the rural district since leaving
nearly 40 years ago, the Republican faces a little-known real
estate investor and is the odds-on favorite in November.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope that people who vote for me would do so because they
think I could do a good job, not because I was a football coach,''
Osborne said during a recent campaign break at Kirk's Restaurant
near Lexington.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've tried not to play up the football aspect,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That's hard to ignore in a state where most boys grow up
aspiring to be Cornhuskers and most families own a Big Red T-shirt
or ball cap, mouse pad, sweat pants or flag. Games on Saturday
afternoons are piped into grocery stores.
</P>
<P>
   Husker football is the unifying force in this sparsely populated
farm state, and Osborne was at the helm of it all for 25 years as
he led teams to three national championships, creating a dynasty.
The team is ranked No. 1 again this year in preseason polls, two
years after Osborne left.
</P>
<P>
   Smiles greet Osborne almost everywhere in the state. When he
stood up to leave Kirk's Restaurant, a trucker rose to shake his
hand -- and as Osborne exited, he hollered: ''You got my vote in
November!''
</P>
<P>
   Is the trucker a Husker fan?
</P>
<P>
   ''Isn't it a requirement in Nebraska?'' he replied.
</P>
<P>
   Osborne left football to spend more time with his family and the
youth-mentoring program he started by matching Husker players with
at-risk youth. He also cited concerns over heart problems, but
since has received a clean bill of health.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a full schedule of speaking engagements and appearances
at charitable events, Osborne grew bored of retirement and decided
to give politics a try.
</P>
<P>
   ''I guess I'm not good at retiring,'' the 63-year-old said.
</P>
<P>
   The grandson of a former Nebraska state senator, Osborne saw an
opening when Republican Rep. Bill Barrett announced that he would
retire from representing the 3rd District at the end of his fifth
term.
</P>
<P>
   Before Osborne started his campaign in January, no one knew for
sure his political affiliation or where he stood on major issues.
It didn't matter.
</P>
<P>
   ''I leave town, come back and find out God is running against
me,'' said Carroll Sheldon, one of four Republican candidates who
dropped out after Osborne entered the GOP primary race.
</P>
<P>
   Barrett himself said the party found someone who can ''walk on
water'' to replace him. Against two little-known opponents in the
May primary, Osborne won 71 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Having the support of the state's football faithful in a
district where two out of three voters are Republicans, Osborne
nearly has a lock on the district seat. Even his opponent admits
that.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm running against one of the most popular men in America --
based on his football success,'' said Democrat Rollie Reynolds, 69.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Osborne doesn't accept money from political action
committees or any individual contributions of more than $300, he
has amassed more than $200,000. Reynolds has raised $1,375.
</P>
<P>
   ''People haven't given me much of a chance,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Osborne's campaign is rooted in his call to revitalize
agriculture by lifting trade embargoes, stopping the brain drain of
Nebraska's youth and thwarting what he calls the unraveling of
culture.
</P>
<P>
   He opposes abortion and gun control, supports increasing legal
immigration quotas and questions the fairness and deterrence of the
death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   To run for the district's seat, Osborne recently took up
residence at a cabin he owns at LeMoyne, 260 miles west of Lincoln.
</P>
<P>
   Call him a carpetbagger, point to his lack of political
experience or refer to his so-so support of the death penalty in
this conservative district and you'll get nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   ''Tom Osborne is so highly regarded,'' state Democratic Party
Chairwoman Anne Boyle said. ''Anybody who wants to go negative on
Tom Osborne is probably not going to be well-received.''
</P>
<P>
   Even one of the darkest chapters in Osborne's life is not likely
to be rehashed during the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The coach was sharply criticized by some for his handling of
Lawrence Phillips, a star Nebraska running back who pleaded no
contest to assaulting his ex-girlfriend during the 1995 season.
</P>
<P>
   Osborne suspended Phillips for six weeks but allowed him back on
the team to play in the Fiesta Bowl and help the Huskers win their
second consecutive national championship.
</P>
<P>
   His critics claimed the incident proved that Osborne was willing
to win at any cost.
</P>
<P>
   ''Many people were outraged at the way it was handled,'' said
Mary Beck, a member of the University of Nebraska's women's
commission. ''The coaching staff seemed to be quite willing to
close their eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I tried to treat each player like I would want my son to be
treated,'' said Osborne, who is clearly tired of reliving his
Phillips decision.
</P>
<P>
   But even Beck admits voters likely will only recall Osborne's
successes.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you poll most Nebraskans, they wouldn't care because
football is a very big deal here,'' she said. ''It won't come back
to haunt him.''

<HEADLINE> Catholic Diocese Created in Texas  </HEADLINE>
By MICHELLE KOIDIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAREDO, Texas (AP) -- Hundreds of devoted Catholics packed the
Laredo Civic Center as church officials formally established the
Diocese of Laredo and installed its first bishop, the Most Rev.
James Tamayo.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a historic moment for the church in Texas,'' said the
Most Rev. Gabriel Montalvo, a representative of Pope John Paul II
to the U.S. church. He initiated Tamayo during a special Mass on
Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   The event was long anticipated by thousands of Catholics living
along the Texas-Mexico border.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's a very special thing for people to have their
leader so close by,'' said Joyce Raulie, 64, who was among an
overflowing crowd of about 2,000 at the bilingual service. ''They
feel comfort.''
</P>
<P>
   Tamayo, 50, auxiliary bishop of the Diocese of Galveston-Houston
since 1993, will oversee a huge swath of south Texas. The border
region, previously split between the San Antonio and Corpus Christi
dioceses, is home to nearly 200,000 Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   Creating a diocese in the rapidly growing area had been
discussed for more than 10 years. Laredo becomes the 15th diocese
under the ecclesiastical province of San Antonio, the largest
Catholic province in the country and third largest in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Tamayo, a Mexican-American born in Brownsville and raised in
Corpus Christi, earned a bachelor's and master's degree from the
University of St. Thomas in Houston before becoming ordained in
Corpus Christi in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   He headed the Corpus Christi diocese's western vicariate in
Laredo from 1990 to 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The bilingual bishop wants to mold his new diocese to address
the specific needs and desires of border residents. He said the
diocese will follow tradition, ''but with the uniqueness of our
Spanish language and culture integrated into the devotions of the
church.''
</P>
<P>
   Tamayo says his motto is ''Todo con amor,'' or ''all with
love.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Anthony Mendoza, parochial vicar of Laredo's San Martin
de Porres Parish, said parishioners have been looking forward to
Tamayo's arrival.
</P>
<P>
   ''People are very excited because we'll have a bishop more
accessible to us instead of a bishop who has to travel from very
far away,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Medicaid Funds Used To Remove Lead  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID RISING
<TEXT>
<P>
   PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- When 9-month-old Siara Padilla was
diagnosed with lead poisoning, her mother couldn't afford to remove
the lead paint from the window panes of her home.
</P>
<P>
   To protect her child, Marie Padilla had to forfeit her West
Warwick house, declare bankruptcy and move.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been a rough road back,'' Padilla said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a new state program aims to help people like Padilla by
using Medicaid funds to provide homeowners low-interest loans for
lead removal.
</P>
<P>
   Rhode Island worked for two years to win permission for the
program from the U.S. Department of Human Services. The state is
the first in the nation to use Medicaid money normally slated to
treat lead poisoning for lead removal instead, Gov. Lincoln Almond
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's an accomplishment of which we can all be very proud,''
Almond said. ''Removing these windows is one of the best ways to
make lead poisoning a thing of the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Lead paint was banned in 1978. Medical experts linked lead
poisoning to lower IQ, mental retardation, learning difficulties,
behavioral problems and even death.
</P>
<P>
   In the last three years alone, Rhode Island has spent $10
million in state and federal money on lead removal, education and
other health programs, reducing the risk to young people.
</P>
<P>
   Next year, the percentage of children with lead poisoning
entering kindergarten in the state is expected to about 13 percent,
compared with 35 percent four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But about 300,000 homes in Rhode Island remain contaminated,
partly due to a shortage of lead abatement teams and the complexity
of removing the hazardous paint.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's throughout our state. Rich, poor, middle class -- it's a
silent killer that affects all of our children,'' said Christine
Ferguson, director of the Department of Human Services.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new program, $300,000 of Medicaid funds will be
combined with other government money to help homeowners replace
painted windows, the primary source of lead dust in homes, said
Richard Godfrey, executive director of Rhode Island Housing.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have had a lot of inquiries from other states about how we
went through the process of getting the special waiver,'' said
Tracey Manni, spokeswoman for the Department of Human Services.
''Nobody had ever asked to use Medicaid funds to replace windows.''
</P>
<P>
   Hector Diaz, who owns a home in Providence, was among the first
beneficiaries of the program. He said the loan was the only way he
could do what was needed to protect his son and daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's too much money to fix the house,'' Diaz said as his
windows were being replaced Wednesday. ''This is a good program.
This neighborhood needs this program. There are a lot of houses in
bad condition.''

<HEADLINE> Auditor Blasts Shipyard Project  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL RUBINKAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The state auditor has launched a scathing
attack on the Philadelphia Shipyard project, saying millions of
taxpayer dollars have been wasted with little government oversight.
</P>
<P>
   In a 171-page report issued Wednesday, Auditor General Robert
Casey Jr. portrayed the 1997 deal that brought Norwegian
shipbuilder Kvaerner ASA to Philadelphia as an expensive gamble
with little public benefit so far.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was an irresistible deal for Kvaerner and a risky
proposition for taxpayers,'' said Casey, a Democrat who is widely
mentioned as a possible gubernatorial candidate in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Tom Ridge's administration disputed the findings of the
16-month performance audit. The Republican administration called
them ''fiction'' and a ''disingenuous sleight of hand.''
</P>
<P>
   The audit found that the agreement permitted Kvaerner to spend
little of its own money to develop the shipyard while putting
Pennsylvania taxpayers on the hook for $227 million. The city, the
federal government and private sources kicked in an additional $202
million, while Kvaerner was required to invest $165 million over 11
years, beginning in 2004.
</P>
<P>
   Casey also found that the Philadelphia Shipyard Development
Corp., the agency overseeing the project, gave nearly $2 million in
taxpayer money to Kvaerner for living expenses for top executives.
Among them: $2,000 for a child's swing set, $6,000 for a grand
piano, $4,800 for artwork, $16,500 for sofas and $8,400 for patio
furniture. PSDC later determined the swings, piano and artwork were
not reimbursable expenses.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, taxpayers paid for the Kvaerner president's leased
BMW 740iL ($1,007 per month) and his rented, $675,000 suburban
Philadelphia house ($6,500 per month.) In all, he received $12,600
per month for living expenses, while six vice presidents received
$9,500.
</P>
<P>
   Casey called the perks a ''serious, substantial abuse of the
public trust.''
</P>
<P>
   However, administration officials said the money spent on
company executives was in line with industry standards and deemed
appropriate by the accounting firm Ernst &AMP; Young. Also, PSDC pays
monthly allowances that are subject to a final audit. The audit
began only recently and has already turned up several
nonreimbursable expenses, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We haven't had our crack at it yet. We started it according to
our schedule just a couple months ago,'' Ridge spokesman Tim Reeves
said.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations with Kvaerner, Europe's largest shipbuilding
business, began in 1996 and led to a $429 million funding package
to provide training and services for former employees of the
Philadelphia Naval Shipyard. Ridge and others said the project
would restore jobs and revive a dying American industry with deep
roots in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Nine months later, Kvaerner announced it was leaving the
shipbuilding business because of sagging profits. However, the
company was bound by its agreement here and began construction on
its first ship this spring.
</P>
<P>
   The 700-foot container vessel, the first to be built in
Philadelphia since 1970, is scheduled for completion by summer
2002.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel McCullough, state secretary of community and economic
development, estimated the project will eventually add more than
13,000 spinoff jobs to the region, a per-job expenditure of
$31,000.
</P>
<P>
   Ridge also noted that Casey voted for the Kvaerner deal three
years ago as a member of the Delaware River Port Authority, which
contributed $65 million to the shipyard.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the deal was so outrageous, he should have voted no. You
can't get the laurels three years ago, and stand up in outrage
now,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Japan Gov. Sentenced in Sex Assault  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- A court sentenced the former governor of Osaka on
Thursday to 18 months in prison for molesting a college student in
a case viewed as a test of how Japan's justice system deals with
sexual harassment.
</P>
<P>
   Knock Yokoyama, 68, had pleaded guilty to indecently assaulting
the 23-year-old volunteer in the back of a campaign van last year
when the trial started in March.
</P>
<P>
   The court granted prosecutors' demands that Yokoyama be given an
18 month jail term, but suspended the sentence for three years, the
court said.
</P>
<P>
   The groping scandal forced the former standup comic to resign as
governor in December, and focused Japan's attention on the issue of
sexual harassment that until recently had not been taken very
seriously here.
</P>
<P>
   A civil court has ordered Yokoyama, whose real name is Isamu
Yamada, to pay $101,852 in damages to the victim, the largest award
in a sexual harassment case in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Yokoyama had repeatedly denied any wrongdoing last year before
pleading guilty to the charges in March.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Set To Greet Venezuela Leader  </HEADLINE>
By LEON BARKHO
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez's visit to
Iraq -- the first by a head of state since the Persian Gulf War --
violates no U.N. sanctions but is being called ''particularly
galling'' by the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Iraqi officials waited with nervous excitement Thursday for
Chavez to start a visit that has delighted President Saddam
Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqi Foreign Ministry has pulled out all the stops for the
Venezuelan leader, hailing him as ''a dear guest'' whose visit is
''another slap in the face of American rulers ... for their
rejected practices in the international arena.''
</P>
<P>
   The government has prepared a red-carpet reception for Chavez,
who was due to drive across the Iranian-Iraqi border at
al-Mundhariya, 125 miles east of Baghdad, about lunchtime. Cabinet
ministers, a brass band and dozens of foreign and local journalists
will be there.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez's trip to the Middle East, designed to drum up support
for a summit of Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries in
Caracas on Sept. 27, has already borne fruit in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Oil Ministry officials have said they regard Venezuela,
previously a notorious buster of OPEC production quotas, as an
''oil-producing partner'' with whom they can coordinate plans to
counter the influence of Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez's visit appears to have made Iraq change its view on his
proposal for an oil price band that OPEC members should aim for.
Iraq had rejected the idea in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ''We agree with what Chavez is lobbying for,'' the head of the
Iraqi Oil Ministry's economic section, Abdulillah al-Tikriti, told
The Associated Press, adding that his country will accept Chavez's
ideas for a price band.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has expressed dismay about Chavez's trip,
saying it confers on Saddam legitimacy he doesn't deserve.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. State Department spokesman Richard Boucher says it is
''particularly galling'' that the first state visit to Iraq since
the 1991 Persian Gulf War is being made by a democratically elected
leader, and called it a ''dubious distinction'' for Chavez.
</P>
<P>
   Venezuelan Foreign Minister Jose Vicente Rangel says Chavez is
free to travel as he pleases.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez, who is popular at home, has a record of bucking the
United States in foreign policy. He has nurtured ties with
countries such as Cuba and China and has hailed Libya as a ''model
of participatory democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   But he is not bucking the U.N. sanctions maintained against Iraq
since its 1990 invasion of Kuwait. Chavez will cross the border by
road, respecting the sanctions' ban on flights to and from Iraq,
and is expected to take a helicopter to Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez could have run into trouble if he had flown into Iraq,
although enforcement of a 1990 Security Council resolution imposing
a type of air embargo has been in dispute for years.
</P>
<P>
   Since Chavez will not be violating any U.N. sanctions by
traveling overland, U.S. Ambassador Richard Holbrooke has not
raised the matter before the U.N. sanctions committee and likely
will not, U.S. officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear whether Saddam would meet Chavez at the border,
but the two leaders were certain to meet in Baghdad, where Chavez
will stay overnight before returning to Iran on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez's tour has taken him to Kuwait, Iran, Qatar, Saudi Arabia
and the United Arab Emirates. Unlike these OPEC states, Iraq is not
part of the cartel's quota system but its exports of nearly 2.6
million barrels a day under a U.N. aid program cannot be ignored.
</P>
<P>
   A senior official at Iraq's Oil Ministry, Faleh al-Khayat, said
Iraq is determined to produce and export as much as possible to
maximize its earnings, which are used mainly to purchase food,
medicine and other essential goods to ease the plight of Iraqis
living under the sanctions.

<HEADLINE> Media Takes on German Neo-Nazism  </HEADLINE>
By BURT HERMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- Nancy Dietz owns her own hair salon in Stuttgart.
She's a 31-year-old native of Kenya with two children who has lived
in Germany for 12 years. This, the readers of Germany's most widely
read newspaper, learned from a short biography of Dietz printed
with her photo under the logo: ''I live in Germany.''
</P>
<P>
   The 10-day-old campaign by Bild Zeitung, launched after a bomb
blast injured 10 recent immigrants, promotes awareness that
foreigners are an integral part of German society -- from soccer
players to TV moderators to ordinary citizens.
</P>
<P>
   It is part of a burgeoning media response to growing fears of
right-wing violence; The first neo-Nazi killing in years was
recorded in 1999, and three have occurred so far this year. Across
the country, newspaper front pages, advertising campaigns and Web
sites are being dedicated to galvanizing Germans to leave their
living rooms and act loudly and publicly against neo-Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can succeed in forcing the right-wing violence out of our
society only by working together,'' editors of the Berliner
Morgenpost newspaper wrote Wednesday in a front-page letter to
readers, introducing an issue dedicated entirely to fighting
right-wing violence.
</P>
<P>
   With many politicians on summer break, and the president -- whose
ceremonial role traditionally serves as Germany's conscience --
recovering from surgery, the media has been increasingly asserting
its place as the country's moral compass.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a positive development that it has become a large theme
in the media,'' said Franziska Hundseder, head of the union
representing German journalists who has written extensively about
the extreme right.
</P>
<P>
   The Berliner Morgenpost newspaper's special issue Wednesday
featured politicians, business leaders and entertainers speaking
out against violence on the cover of each section. For more than a
month, the respected Die Zeit weekly has been publishing a
''Chronology of Violence'' detailing neo-Nazi incidents.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we let violence go, or play it down, it's not just about
Germany's reputation, but about the culture and our own image of
our country,'' former President Roman Herzog wrote in a front-page
article published Wednesday in Bild.
</P>
<P>
   Stories about neo-Nazi violence are regularly covered in German
media. But there's been a distinct change in tone. Now, stories
that might have been relegated to back pages in newspapers are
getting front-page treatment and leading national newscasts.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, news that three skinheads would stand trial for
murder in the beating death of a Mozambican man was a top story on
TV newscasts.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the blanket coverage, Hundseder, the journalist union
leader, said not enough has been done to cover all sides of the
rising threat of the right -- such as those in academic or
intellectual circles, who aren't so easily identified by the
clothes they wear or their haircuts.
</P>
<P>
   ''The danger to democracy there is just as large as the danger
of violence on the street,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The government, along with Jewish leaders, this week also
announced plans for a wide-reaching ''Show Your Face'' campaign
with figures from film, television and sports, who are to appear at
a major event scheduled for late September in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a campaign against the violence can only work if it gets
the backing of all of society, said Rainer Erb, a professor of
sociology who works at the Center for anti-Semitism Research at
Berlin's Technical University.
</P>
<P>
   ''One needs to motivate the citizens' power against this
violence, in churches, schools and so on,'' he said. ''Then the
politicians can give help and they can support them.''
</P>
<P>
   Answering the call for more public involvement, a group of
citizens took to the Internet to post a home page that aims to
bring different people together. Under their page, at www.howru.de,
people can offer anonymous invitations to host dinners with
foreigners living in Germany or foreigners can express their
interest.
</P>
<P>
   Andreas Evers, a longtime west Berlin resident reading the
Berliner Morgenpost special edition at a cafe over coffee and a
croissant, said he thought campaigns including public figures could
be effective but questioned why such an uproar wasn't made earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is good to see this in all newspapers, but in my opinion it
is too late,'' he said. ''The mood is really at point-zero. People
have just looked on far too long in schools, but perhaps also in
families.''

<HEADLINE> Former Israeli Allies Frustrated  </HEADLINE>
By RON KAMPEAS
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHLOMI, Israel (AP) -- In cramped rooms cluttered with mementoes
of Lebanon, Israel's former allies and their families talk, think
and dream of the land they left behind.
</P>
<P>
   There's little else to do for the 5,000 or so refugees who fled
across the border when Israeli forces ended their 18-year
occupation of south Lebanon two months ago: They need special
permission to leave their quarters. Most don't ask for it, having
nowhere special to go.
</P>
<P>
   Television and radio broadcasts about Wednesday's deployment of
Lebanese security forces to the south broke the monotony at the
youth hostel in this sleepy mountain town in northwestern Israel,
where 276 of the Lebanese are housed.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to see if it's for real,'' said Nicola, a former
militiaman in the mostly Christian Israel-controlled South Lebanese
Army. ''If it is, we'll go home.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicola -- like all those interviewed, he fears retribution and
would give only his first name -- says he believes the Beirut-based
government would restore order if it is genuine in its effort to
control the south.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, the vacuum has been filled by the Hezbollah, the
Islamic militia that led the battle to drive Israel from the
''security zone'' it declared to protect its northern villages from
attack. Hezbollah has promised punishment for those who
collaborated with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The Lebanese government has suggested that its forces -- and U.N.
peacekeepers -- would only replace the militia in parts of the
south.
</P>
<P>
   Others at the hostel were less optimistic than Nicola, citing
the likelihood of a continued Hezbollah presence in the south.
</P>
<P>
   ''We hope to go to Canada, where I have a brother,'' said Eva,
cradling her 4-year-old daughter, Juliana. ''We don't want to deal
with the Hezbollah.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the signs of the Hezbollah approaching the town of
Marjayoun -- ''We saw the flags, we heard the cries of 'God is
Great!''' -- that led Eva and her husband, Elias, to gather their
small children and leave for an uncertain future in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ''In Marjayoun, the kids had a playroom filled with books,
videos, toys,'' Eva said. ''Here we are five to a room.''
</P>
<P>
   A growing number of the Lebanese here are becoming vociferous
about living conditions they had been led to believe were
temporary. Israel's notoriously secretive Shin Bet security
service, which handles their absorption here, will not reveal its
plans for the families.
</P>
<P>
   ''We spend our days on remote control,'' said Pierre, the Shlomi
group's unofficial leader, miming a clicker. ''At seven, get up,
have breakfast, sit around and talk until one, have lunch, sit
around and talk until dinner, then to sleep -- and it starts again
the next day.''
</P>
<P>
   They discuss their anxieties: Will they be asked to settle here,
in one of the northern cities, or have they received an invitation
to Germany, France or Canada? Will they get jobs? When -- and where
-- will their kids start school?
</P>
<P>
   At lunch, Pierre uses a megaphone to issue a warning to those
assembled in the cafeteria: All excursions out of Shlomi must be
authorized by their hosts. The Israelis who run the hostel won't
say why, but Shlomi's mayor recently complained to the press that
the former SLA men ''look at'' local girls.
</P>
<P>
   One man, Nicola explained, who hopped a bus to a nearby town to
visit a brother had just been punished by being exiled to ''less
pleasant'' quarters. Nicola was not sure where that was, but
Israeli newspapers have published photos of former SLA men living
in damp-ridden bomb shelters.
</P>
<P>
   About 2,000 refugees, most not related to militiamen, have
returned since May.
</P>
<P>
   The militia's senior officers are housed at luxury hotels
overlooking the Mediterranean. The residents of the Shlomi hostel
get about $500 a month, plus room and board.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the money goes into the hostel's single pay phone, where
they make expensive calls to Lebanon. They ask about family,
property and the sentences handed down in absentia in Beirut
courts.
</P>
<P>
   In his room, standing before a corner decorated with photos of
himself in Lebanese nightclubs, all of which surround an icon of a
pregnant Virgin Mary, Pierre said he knows he can never return.
</P>
<P>
   Had he learned whether a court had sentenced him? He nodded and
smiled, drawing a fingertip across his throat.

<HEADLINE> British Hoover Children Reunited  </HEADLINE>
By SUE LEEMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Charles Hardy and Fred Tilsley last met 60 years
ago, two boys on board the liner Sameria sailing to the United
States as evacuees from the war in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   As the children of Hoover workers, they were being sent to sit
out the war in North Canton, Ohio, the headquarters of the famous
kitchen goods manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   Although the two failed to keep in touch, Tilsley, 73, quickly
recognized the 72-year-old Hardy as they quaffed champagne
Wednesday at the 60-year reunion of Hoover evacuees outside the
company's striking Art Deco former headquarters in West London.
</P>
<P>
   ''I remember Charles,'' he said, as the two settled down
together to look through photos of the evacuation. ''He was the
same age as me. The crossing was unbelievable -- there were five big
passenger boats in convoy.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardy, who was accompanied by two younger brothers, added: ''I
remember I won a talent competition on board and won $100 by doing
impersonations.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoover, which prided itself on its socially enlightened
policies, sent 83 employees' children, aged 5 to 15, to North
Canton, where employees at company headquarters sheltered them for
five years.
</P>
<P>
   Hoover paid for their crossing, but foster parents were
responsible for their upkeep. Back home, their own parents
contributed to European children's relief funds.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty former evacuees made it to Wednesday's reunion, where
they toured the Hoover building -- now owned by supermarket chain
Tesco -- and drank champagne among the roses on the lawn.
</P>
<P>
   It was from here on Aug. 9, 1940 -- the day before the Battle of
Britain began -- that the evacuation party set out, spending a night
in London with their parents before heading north to Liverpool to
board the Sameria, which took 10 days to zigzag across the Atlantic
as it dodged submarines.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was very hard to let them go,'' said Charlotte Carter, 94,
whose daughter Eileen was on board. ''But we felt we had no
choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Vina Williams, who was 10 at the time, remembers her father
chasing the children's coach as it inched through heavy traffic on
its way out of London.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a difficult time, and in 1941 the British parents
signed consent forms that if the Germans overran Britain our
American parents would look after us indefinitely,'' said Williams,
who organized the reunion.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was a lot for the American parents to take on. But there
were far more people willing to help than there were children.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the youngsters returned with American accents and
dazzling tales of life away from British rationing.
</P>
<P>
   The three Soundy brothers -- Peter, Barry and Robert, 12, 9 and 8
when they left -- rhapsodized about new clothes and discovering the
soda fountain.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was too exciting for us to be sad,'' Peter said, as Robert
interjected: ''The ice creams were 10 times bigger and the hot dogs
were about a foot long. We hadn't seen hot dogs before.''
</P>
<P>
   But for Barbara Cramp, now 73, there is still no place like
home. ''You got care, wonderful care,'' she said. ''But not love --
I used to go to the cinema all day by myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruthe Palmer, who was 11 when she left, said five years ''was a
long time to be away from home. There has always been an aspect in
my life which has never felt truly English.''

<HEADLINE> Stephen King Spotted in Pa.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUTLER, Pa. (AP) -- Maybe there's nothing eerie about western
Pennsylvania, but folks keep seeing Stephen King in a seafood
restaurant around here.
</P>
<P>
   Some residents of Butler and Lawrence counties spotted the
horror author Sunday and Monday at a state police barracks and at a
Red Lobster restaurant. Apparently, King visited the area, about 35
miles north of Pittsburgh, to research rural life for a new book.
</P>
<P>
   Trooper Rob Lagoon said King toured the state police offices
while keeping tightlipped about the story. The author did say it
should be out in 2003 and would be set in an area like western
Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Tina Slupe, the general manager of the restaurant where King
ate, said employees recognized King and asked for his autograph.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LAFAYETTE, Ind. (AP) -- Tippecanoe County Judge Laura Zeman's
fascination for singer Ricky Martin is making her a celebrity, too.
</P>
<P>
   The judge's unlikely hobby prompted music video network VH1 to
dispatch a film crew to Lafayette this week to interview Zeman, her
family and co-workers about her obsession.
</P>
<P>
   Zeman, 43, caught her first Martin concert last Halloween. Since
then, she has been to eight more, and her Martin-mania still hasn't
subsided.
</P>
<P>
   Some people around the courthouse shook their heads Tuesday when
they saw the commotion the six-man film crew caused. But Zeman had
some advice for people who think it's inappropriate for a judge to
be a music fan.
</P>
<P>
   ''They need to get a life,'' said Zeman. ''Everybody has to have
a hobby. What I do for fun is my business. It has nothing to do
with my being a judge.''

<HEADLINE> Lieberman's Finances Scrutinized  </HEADLINE>
By CONNIE CASS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. Joseph Lieberman's wife owned stock in
two TV networks that received his ''Silver Sewer'' award for
offensive programming, but sold them after the issue was raised
publicly.
</P>
<P>
   Senate financial records show Lieberman's biggest source of
outside income last year was a $45,000 advance from Simon &AMP;
Schuster for his autobiographical book, ''In Praise of Public
Life.''
</P>
<P>
   The book, which describes his career and promotes public
service, came out in February as Lieberman was gearing up his
re-election campaign in Connecticut and being mentioned as a
possible running mate for Democratic presidential candidate Al
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Gore picked Lieberman on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The disclosure form filed May 11 shows that Lieberman also
received a $20,000 trustee fee from a trust for heirs of his uncle,
Bernard Manger. Lieberman, 58, who served in the Connecticut Senate
and as state attorney general, received $10,735 in state retirement
payments in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   His wife Hadassah, also received undisclosed sums as a Manger
family trustee and in salary from the American Committee for Shaare
Zedek Hospital in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Their major assets included a blind trust worth $100,000 to
$250,000 and a federal savings account valued at $15,000-$50,000.
Assets are reported within broad ranges, not by exact amount.
</P>
<P>
   Along with several other trades on April 19, 1999, Mrs.
Lieberman bought stock in CBS and Fox Entertainment Group, holdings
valued at less than $15,000 each. In September, Lieberman presented
Fox with his mock award for shows with vulgar, sexual content.
</P>
<P>
   The senator had singled out CBS the year before for airing shock
jock Howard Stern's raunchy television show and a ''60 Minutes''
broadcast of Dr. Jack Kevorkian giving a lethal injection to a
terminally ill man.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Lieberman chooses her investments independently of her
husband and bought the network stocks without his knowledge, as
part of a larger package of recommendations, said Lieberman
spokesman Dan Gerstein. Questions emerged as the holdings were made
public this spring.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Lieberman sold the CBS and Fox stocks shortly afterward
''because some concerns were raised about the perceptions, even
though she didn't see anything wrong with it,'' Gerstein said. ''It
wasn't because Senator Lieberman told her to. She did this on her
own.''
</P>
<P>
   Goading the TV networks to elevate their programming is a
favorite theme of Lieberman's.
</P>
<P>
   ''As even the casual viewer has noticed, there has been an
explosion of crude, rude and lewd material in prime time,'' the
senator writes in an upcoming issue of a magazine for the
Democratic Leadership Council, the centrist political group he
chairs.
</P>
<P>
   Urging the Federal Communications Commission to investigate,
Lieberman writes, ''Is the public interest being served by the glut
of crud currently on the air?''
</P>
<P>
   In other stock activity last year, Mrs. Lieberman sold 500
shares of Occidental Petroleum, valued at less than $15,000.
Environmentalists opposed to the company's oil drilling have
complained that Gore's family holds some $500,000 in Occidental
stock in a trust fund left by his father.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Lieberman also owned $15,000-$50,000 worth of stock in
Pfizer Inc., the pharmaceutical company that makes Viagra.
Executives and employees of pharmaceutical companies, including
Pfizer, make up a large chunk of Lieberman's Senate campaign
donors.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Lieberman's other investments of $15,000 or less include:
CVS drugstores; Questar, the official natural gas supplier to the
2002 Winter Olympics; GTE Corp., which merged with Bell Atlantic to
become Verizon; and MCI Worldcom.
</P>
<P>
   The Liebermans also owned numerous mutual funds, U.S. Treasury
bonds and a condominium in New Haven, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Gerstein said he didn't know whether Lieberman would alter his
portfolio now that he is running for vice president.

<HEADLINE> Genesee brewery gets U.S. funding  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) - Genesee Brewing Corp. has been awarded a
$6.5 million federal grant and loan incentive package.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Andrew Cuomo,
Rochester Mayor William A. Johnson Jr. and U.S. Rep. Louise
Slaughter, D-Fairport, announced the incentive program Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The funds are expected to help Genesee retain 375 workers and
create 80 jobs, Cuomo's office said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's a great day to drink beer!'' said Genesee
President and Chief Executive Tom Hubbard, who is working with an
investment group to buy the brewery from the parent company.
</P>
<P>
   It is unknown when Genesee Corp. directors might make a decision
on Hubbard's purchase offer. It is also uncertain whether the
federal aid is contingent upon the Hubbard group's purchase.
</P>
<P>
   Genesee would use the money - $1.5 million in grants and $5
million in loans - to buy a new production system and build a
brewpub restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Genesee produces 1.6 million barrels of beer and ale a year and
had revenues of $103.3 million in the 1998-99 fiscal year. Its
brands include a line of regional beers - Genesee Beer, Genny Light
and Genny Cream Ale - as well as high-end specialty beers such as
J.W. Dundee Honey Brown Lager and Michael Shea's Irish Amber.

<HEADLINE> Italy's Amato Poised To Be Candidate  </HEADLINE>
By ALESSANDRA RIZZO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME (AP) -- Italy's center-left coalition doesn't have to look
far to find a candidate for premier in next year's elections.
</P>
<P>
   Current Prime Minister Giuliano Amato appears poised to take up
the challenge, even though the coalition leaders and Amato himself
keep saying the official decision will not be made until September.
</P>
<P>
   ''I say that Amato is doing his job very well and that the
electoral match is not lost yet,'' the leader of Italian
Communists, Armando Cossutta, told the Turin daily La Stampa.
</P>
<P>
   National elections must be held by next spring.
</P>
<P>
   The center-right opposition leader, media magnate Silvio
Berlusconi, has been leading in polls. Support for the premier
appears on the rise within the nine-party coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Amato took office as the head of Italy's 58th postwar government
last April and was mainly regarded as stopgap leader, chosen to
take the country to the polls after Massimo D'Alema's resignation
following a bitter loss in regional elections.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the 62-year-old politician nicknamed Dr. Subtle for
both his political finesse and his slender frame has made no secret
of his ambition.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few weeks into the job, he went so far as to threaten to
quit if his allies kept fighting over his successor while he was
still in office. And his remarks last month, during the G-8 summit
in Okinawa, Japan, left little doubt about his intentions.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't run the risk of withdrawing. I don't feel like (Marco)
Pantani,'' he told reporters, referring to the Italian cyclist who
had pulled put of the Tour de France. ''I hope I'll be at the next
G-8 as well.''
</P>
<P>
   In September, Amato is scheduled to present the 2001 budget,
which for the first time in a decade doesn't include new taxes or
public spending cuts -- a move the premier hopes will boost his
popularity.
</P>
<P>
   There is also one other element working for his candidacy: Few
alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   The only serious rival to the premier appears to be Rome's
mayor, Francesco Rutelli. But some political analysts suggest that
the left might not want to waste his candidacy in an election that
many consider already lost.
</P>
<P>
   Among the center-left politicians critical of the premier,
former anti-corruption prosecutor Antonio Di Pietro has been the
most outspoken.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have no intention of being open to Amato,'' he wrote in the
Rome daily La Repubblica, announcing he will not be part of the
coalition. ''By choosing Amato, the left has already lost.''
</P>
<P>
   Amato was the right-hand man to Bettino Craxi when the late
Socialist leader served as premier in the 1980s. Di Pietro
prosecuted Craxi on corruption charges. Amato, however, was never
touched by the scandal.

<HEADLINE> Cubs 5, Dodgers 4, 10 Innings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Jeff Reed drew a bases-loaded walk from
Antonio Osuna in the 10th inning Wednesday night as Chicago beat
the Los Angeles Dodgers 5-4, the Cubs' 13th victory in 19 games.
</P>
<P>
   Osuna (2-5) gave up a one-out double to Sammy Sosa, walked Mark
Grace intentionally and hit Damon Buford with a 1-2 pitch to load
the bases.
</P>
<P>
   With the infield in, first baseman Eric Karros knocked down a
grounder by Gary Matthews Jr. and made a desperate throw to the
plate to force Sosa by a step.
</P>
<P>
   Osuna got ahead of Reed 0-2 before walking him to force in
Grace.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Worrell (2-3), who escaped his own jam in the ninth, pitched
one inning. Rick Aguilera thwarted another Dodgers threat in the
10th for his 27th save in 34 chances.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles put runners on the corners with no one out in the
10th on singles by pinch-hitters Tom Goodwin and Jim Leyritz. But
Aguilera struck out Devon White and got Mark Grudzielanek on a pop
up.
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Green walked to load the bases for Gary Sheffield who
fouled out to Grace at first to end the game.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Lieber, coming off his worst outing of the season, took a
4-3 lead into the eighth before Dave Hansen hit his fifth
pinch-homer this.
</P>
<P>
   Hansen's homer, which ended a string of 14 consecutive batters
retired by Lieber, was his 11th career pinch homer and 10th with
the Dodgers, breaking the franchise record.
</P>
<P>
   Lieber, 5-0 in his last nine starts, was charged with four runs
and five hits in eight innings -- the 15th time in 17 starts that
the right-hander has gone at least seven. He struck out eight and
walked none for the fifth time this season.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Brown, failing for the third straight time to get his 11th
victory, gave up four runs and nine hits -- tying season highs in
both departments.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs snapped a 1-1 tie with three runs in the third on four
hits and two throwing errors by catcher Todd Hundley.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Huson dashed home on the front end of a double steal with
Eric Young. Ricky Gutierrez drove in Young with a single and
Grace's double scored Gutierrez to make it 4-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers closed to 4-3 with two runs in their half of the
third. Lieber gave up a leadoff triple by Cora, hit White with one
out and surrendered consecutive RBI singles by Grudzielanek and
Green. But Sheffield, 3-for-21 lifetime against Lieber, grounded
into a double play with the tying run at third.
</P>
<P>
   Sammy Sosa's RBI double in the first gave the Cubs a 1-0 lead.
Sosa is tied with San Francisco's Jeff Kent for the NL lead with
102 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Hundley broke out of an 0-for-18 slump, including 10 strikeouts,
in the second with his 18th homer. The shot, only the ninth fair
ball hit into the loge level in Dodger Stadium's 39-year history,
tied it at 1.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Brown, who has not won in three starts, struck out five and
walked two. It was only the third time in 16 starts he has allowed
more than one walk. The only other time Brown went three straight
outings this season without a victory was May 5-16, all
no-decisions. ... The Cubs' previous steal of home was by Brian
McRae, on April 13, 1996, at San Francisco. ... John Frederick, who
played for the Dodgers from 1929-34, previously held the mark for
pinch-hit homers. ... Dodgers SS Alex Cora was spiked on the arm by
Young in the third inning during Young's steal of second.

<HEADLINE> NFL Camps Roundup  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Dallas Cowboys cornerback Kevin Smith is at home
deciding
whether to retire after a nine-year career that began with Super
Bowl titles his first two seasons.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ''Kevin came in here with hopes of playing. At this point, he's
making some decisions based on how he feels,'' coach Dave Campo
said Wednesday. ''I think he'll make a relatively quick decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Dallas already was in a bind at cornerback by having to replace
Deion Sanders. Veteran Ryan McNeil was signed to start on one side,
and coaches were hoping Smith could hold down the other while three
draft picks cut their teeth in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Smith was a first-round draft pick from Texas A&AMP;M in 1992. He
became a starter late in his rookie year and was part of Super Bowl
champion teams his first two seasons and another Super Bowl his
fourth year.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's departure also leaves the Cowboys without yet another
link to their glory days of the mid-1990s. Michael Irvin and Daryl
Johnston retired this summer, and offensive tackle Erik Williams
also is away from camp mulling retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Should Smith and Williams leave, only eight players would remain
from the Cowboys' most recent Super Bowl team in 1995. 
Bengals:
</P>
<P>
   Holdout running back Corey Dillon, under pressure to sign before
Friday night's exhibition game with Atlanta, has finally reached
agreement with Cincinnati on a one-year deal.
</P>
<P>
   The team's Web site reported that the contract is worth $3
million, more than twice the $1.37 million tender offer Dillon
turned down in June.
</P>
<P>
   The Bengals have been increasing pressure on Dillon to sign
after failing to work out the multiyear deal.
</P>
<P>
   A restricted free agent, Dillon had been threatening to miss the
season's first 10 games and play only in the last six so that he
could become an unrestricted free agent next season.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Bengals notified Dillon that he would be
ineligible for the first regular-season game on Sept. 10, unless he
signed and reported in time for the Atlanta game, which will be the
Bengals' second preseason game.
Broncos:
</P>
<P>
   Eight-time Pro Bowl safety Steve Atwater will return to the
Broncos after a one-year absence, but just to say goodbye.
</P>
<P>
   Atwater, who played for the New York Jets last year, will sign a
one-year contract with Denver on Aug. 18, only so he can retire as
a Bronco.
</P>
<P>
   Atwater will be honored at an Aug. 19 preseason game at Mile
High Stadium against Dallas, after which he will be released
without any salary-cap ramifications.
</P>
<P>
   Owner Pat Bowlen called it ''a tribute for one of the finest and
classiest players ever to wear a Broncos uniform.''
Chiefs:
</P>
<P>
   First-round draft pick Sylvester Morris arrived at training camp
Wednesday, giving him five practices before his first exhibition
game.
</P>
<P>
   The wide receiver from Jackson State ended a 20-day holdout by
agreeing to a seven-year contract. Terms of the contract were not
released, but are reported to be about $9 million for the first
five years, including a signing bonus.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Gunther Cunningham said Morris will see some action
against San Francisco on Sunday.
Lions:
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Charlie Batch estimates he has a 75 percent chance
of playing in the team's opener at New Orleans on Sept. 3.
</P>
<P>
   Batch, who broke a bone in his right knee on June 5 and had
surgery on June 12, spent Monday and Tuesday in Birmingham, Ala.,
with orthopedic surgeon Dr. James Andrews.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everything was very positive down there,'' Batch said. ''He
used the sessions to see how much pain I could tolerate and whether
or not my knee would swell up. None of the two occurred, and that
was very encouraging.''
Bills:
</P>
<P>
   Doug Flutie, joking he's pedaled enough on a stationary bike to
be ready for the Tour de France, believes he's ahead of schedule in
recovering from a torn groin muscle.
</P>
<P>
   An MRI scheduled for early next week to assess his recovery will
hopefully confirm his beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wanted to take the exam this week because I'm feeling better
than I think they thought I would,'' Flutie said. ''Once we know,
we can beef up a little.''
</P>
<P>
   Flutie, who was hurt two weeks ago, said there's an outside shot
he'll be ready for the Bills regular-season opener on Sept. 3. At
the latest, Flutie said he'll be back by Oct. 1, the fourth game of
the season, which follows their scheduled bye week.
</P>
<P>
   With Flutie out, the Bills re-signed Alex Van Pelt to back up
starter Rob Johnson.
49ers:
</P>
<P>
   Center Chris Dalman is out indefinitely with a spine injury.
</P>
<P>
   Dalman collided with another player during blocking drills
Tuesday. An X-ray and MRI revealed an injury between the fifth and
sixth vertebrae in his neck.
</P>
<P>
   Dalman has been the 49ers' starting center for the past three
seasons. He was expected to return to San Francisco on Wednesday to
consult with Dr. Bob Millard, the team orthopedist.

<HEADLINE> Pacers Sign Reggie Miller  </HEADLINE>
By HANK LOWENKRON
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Reggie Miller has a new contract, and he
wants backcourt mate Mark Jackson to join him for another season
with the Indiana Pacers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mark has meant so much to the franchise,'' Miller said in a
statement distributed at the news conference where his signing was
announced. ''You hear about some of these jerks and some of these
guys with attitudes, it is hard to find quality people who know how
to play the game.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mark knows how to play the game. It would be a disservice to
this organization if they do not sign Mark.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson is one of six key players, including four starters, who
became free agents this summer. Club president Donnie Walsh has
re-signed four and said Wednesday he'd like to bring back all six
back. Rik Smits, who is considering retirement, is the other
unsigned free agent.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh said he hoped to talk with Smits later this month to
discuss his plans and would negotiate a new deal if he the 7-foot-4
center wants to return.
</P>
<P>
   The big change for Miller and his teammates since the Los
Angeles Lakers ended their season in Game 6 of the NBA Finals has
been Isiah Thomas replacing Larry Bird as coach.
</P>
<P>
   ''Isiah was one of the players along with Magic Johnson, Byron
(Scott), Michael Cooper that helped cultivate and raise me when I
was at UCLA when they would come in and play in the pick-up summer
games,'' Miller said. ''I have had a great relationship with him
these past 10 or 11 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller, the NBA's career leader in 3-point attempts and baskets,
apparently convinced Walsh to offer him a new contract during the
playoffs, when Miller averaged 24 points.
</P>
<P>
   Miller will be 35 this month.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has been part of every big moment that we've had here the
last 13 years,'' Walsh said. ''Judging from the playoffs that he
had last year (season), I didn't see any age in all that. It seemed
to me he played as well or better than he ever played. ... I think
that was a remarkable performance.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller has played more games and scored more points than any
player in franchise history. His clutch shooting carried Indiana to
its first trip to the NBA Finals last season.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-7 guard earned $9 million last season and was
eligible to receive up to $14 million next season.
</P>
<P>
   Contract terms were not disclosed by the team. ESPN and The
Indianapolis Star reported Miller agreed to a three-year, $36
million deal, which Walsh refused to confirm or deny.
</P>
<P>
   Three telephone calls to agent Arn Tellem's office were not
returned.
</P>
<P>
   Led by Miller, the Pacers advanced to the Eastern Conference
finals five of the last seven years -- and won their first
conference title this season.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can make another run, but we still need to add a few more
weapons. There are other teams in the East that have gotten much
better than we are now,'' Miller said in his statement.
''Hopefully, Donnie isn't done. He needs to find some more players.
... We can't stay status quo. We need some bigger bodies.''

<P>
   Walsh, meanwhile, said he is assuming that young players like
Jonathan Bender, Al Harrington and Jeff Foster might be significant
help next season.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh also said that while he wants to bring Jackson back, he
might lack the money to accomplish the job.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've made offers. There is a team out there that has a lot of
cap room. I'm not quite sure I'm going to be able to match what
they offer,'' Walsh said of Jackson. ''He may be in a position
where he can get a bigger offer we might not be able to match.''
</P>
<P>
   The speculation is that Toronto might be the team Walsh was
talking about, although he did not specify it was the Raptors.
</P>
<P>
   Jalen Rose, who edged Miller as the team's scoring leader last

seven-year deal worth $93 million a week ago.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Cowboys WR Irvin Is Arrested  </HEADLINE>
By KELLIE B. GORMLY
<TEXT>
<P>
   PLANO, Texas (AP) -- Police looking for someone else arrested
former Dallas Cowboys wide receiver Michael Irvin for marijuana
possession.
</P>
<P>
   Irvin and 21-year-old Nelly Adham of Dallas were arrested at a
north Dallas apartment by an FBI task force Wednesday. They were
taken into custody at Plano City Jail and charged with possession
of less than 2 ounces of marijuana, a Class B misdemeanor, Plano
Police Department Sgt. Mark Hunt said.
</P>
<P>
   Irvin said he simply was in the wrong place at the wrong time
and described the arrest as an unfortunate coincidence.
</P>
<P>
   ''I really don't know what went on. I was visiting somebody and
the police came looking for somebody else and I was in the house,''
Irvin said after his lawyer signed for his release.
</P>
<P>
   ''They tore the house up and they found I guess what you would
call a roach, a half a joint, and that's why I got arrested,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Irvin said police found ''nothing on me ... They impounded my
car, they searched my car, and they found nothing in my car. That's
all I gotta say.'' Irvin then departed in a sport-utility vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Maximum punishment on a Class B misdemeanor is a $2,000 fine and
180 days in jail.
</P>
<P>
   FBI spokeswoman Lori Bailey said officers from a drug task force
went to the apartment to arrest a woman for heroin trafficking as
part of a regional sweep. The woman named in the warrant was not at
the apartment, but Irvin and Adham -- described as a friend of
Irvin's -- were there with marijuana, Hunt said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is total happenstance. We had no prior knowledge he was
going to be in there,'' Bailey said.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second time in less than five years Irvin was charged
with a drug crime. In 1996, he pleaded no contest to second-degree
felony cocaine possession in exchange for four years of deferred
probation, a $10,000 fine and dismissal of misdemeanor marijuana
possession charges from the same incident.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Duke, spokesman for the Plano Police Department, said he
understood officers found marijuana on Irvin, but Irvin denied it.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said he would reserve comment until he
knew more details, noting that in late 1996 Irvin was falsely
accused of sexual assault. That claim came five months after Irvin
pleaded no contest to felony drug charges.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would remind us all that Michael has been a victim of false
allegations before,'' Jones said from training camp in Wichita
Falls. ''I know this: I'm going to be very sensitive, very careful
how I come to any conclusions.''
</P>
<P>
   Irvin, who won three Super Bowls with the Cowboys, retired in
July after seriously injuring his neck last Oct. 10 in a game at
Philadelphia. He was hired to work on the Sunday pregame show on
Fox Sports Net.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't yet have all the facts and until we do, we have no
comment,'' Fox Sports Net spokesman Lou D'Ermilio said in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Four days before he announced his retirement, Irvin completed
his probation on the 1996 drug charge. The terms included 800 hours
of community service. The NFL also suspended him for five games.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, he cut a teammate's neck with a pair of scissors while
horsing around in a dormitory during training camp.
</P>
<P>
   Irvin caught 750 passes for 11,904 yards in his career. At the
time of his final play, both figures ranked ninth in NFL history.
Of the players ahead of him, only Jerry Rice had as many Super Bowl
rings.

<HEADLINE> 11 Dead in N.J. Plane Collision  </HEADLINE>
By BRENDAN SCHURR
<TEXT>
<P>
   BURLINGTON TOWNSHIP, N.J. (AP) -- The support beams in Ed and
Cathy Trzaskawka's brick home are clearly visible, the roof and
garage charred. Around the burned-out shells of their two cars is
the wreckage of a small plane.
</P>
<P>
   The couple managed to escape unharmed from the house set ablaze
Wednesday when two planes collided in the air, showering debris and
bodies over a neighborhood in the nation's most densely populated
state.
</P>
<P>
   ''I heard a loud explosion, then a roar and the house shook,
then immediately ignited,'' Ed Trzaskawka said.
</P>
<P>
   All 11 people aboard the two planes died. No one on the ground
was injured.
</P>
<P>
   Five bodies and the fuselage of one plane landed in the garage
of the Trzaskawka's house in the upscale Steeplechase subdivision,
about 10 miles south of Trenton. Another victim fell through the
roof of a garage two blocks away, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Three more bodies fell from the sky into nearby athletic fields,
some still strapped in their seats. The bodies of a flight
instructor and student pilot from the second plane fell into a
soybean field.
</P>
<P>
   The search area covered two square miles.
</P>
<P>
   Nicole Lambert, who lives near the crash site, said she saw
wreckage fall in a column of fire as debris scattered around her
home. One engine piece gouged a chunk out of the street near her
driveway.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought someone was shooting birds,'' Lambert said. ''Then I
saw the big piece fall down and I knew it was a plane.''
</P>
<P>
   The Piper Navajo carried seven civilian Navy employees and two
crew members. The second plane, a Piper Seminole, carried the
flight instructor and student.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Aviation Administration and the National
Transportation Safety Board were interviewing witnesses and
examining wreckage to determine what happened. A key will be
determining at what angle the planes collided, NTSB investigator
Robert Benzon said.
</P>
<P>
   The planes did not carry flight recording devices commonly known
as black boxes. Benzon said radar images also do not give enough
detail.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will take good old-fashioned detective work to determine
the angle,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Specialists in radar, aircraft performance and operations will
join representatives from the Navy and the plane manufacturers in
the probe.
</P>
<P>
   The Naval employees and two crew members were on a chartered
flight from the Lakehurst Naval Air Engineering Station to Patuxent
River Naval Air Station, Md., about 60 miles southeast of
Washington, D.C., said State Police Maj. Barry Roberson.
</P>
<P>
   The flight instructor, from the Hortman Aviation flight school,
and student had taken off from Northeast Philadelphia Airport.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you can look for a bright side to all this, it is a miracle
no one on the ground was hurt. It's a miracle they survived,'' said
Gov. Christie Whitman, visited the Trzaskawka's home hours after
the crash. Cathy Trzaskawka is a former employee in the governor's
office.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy identified its seven employees as Angelo George of Toms
River; Cynthia Kovacs of Robbinsville; Robert Polo of Barnegat;
Michael Simodejka of Toms River; John Vail Jr. of Howell; John
Zukow of Toms River; and David Dahlen of Warminster, Pa. The crew
was identified as Daniel Groff and Joseph Mari, employed by
Patuxent Airways of California, Md.
</P>
<P>
   The flight instructor was identified as Craig Robinson, 28, of
Hamilton Township. The student, a licensed pilot working toward a
commercial license, was not immediately identified.

<HEADLINE> Democratic Ticket To Focus on South  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE GLOVER
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Focusing on welfare reform and economic revival
in the South, Al Gore and Joseph Lieberman signaled their intent to
contest the region despite its recent Republican tilt.
</P>
<P>
   The first stop Thursday was a meeting southern Democratic
governors convened here specifically to tie into the Gore-Lieberman
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   While they planned no new policy initiatives, they were couching
welfare issues in terms geared to sell with moderates, arguing they
represent a new generation of Democratic leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ''We imposed time limits and required work,'' Gore said in
remarks prepared for the conference, taking pride in facets of
welfare reform that angered liberals.
</P>
<P>
   ''We moved millions from welfare to work and gave people more
than a paycheck, we gave them pride again,'' said Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Gore aides said the southern Democratic governors want to push
welfare reform as an issue in the region. Gore noted that the
nation now has the fewest number of people on welfare -- 6.6 million
-- since 1968 and pledged to continue the effort.
</P>
<P>
   If elected, Gore said he would seek ''the next generation of
welfare reform, to encourage responsible fatherhood.''
</P>
<P>
   Governors expected at Thursday's meeting were Don Siegelman of
Alabama, Paul Patton of Kentucky, James Hunt of North Carolina and
Roy Barnes of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   With Bush favored throughout the region, Gore could gain by
forcing his rival to spend valuable time and money in the South.
</P>
<P>
   But first, the Democratic pair had some explaining to do
Wednesday on abortion and some other differences.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman has said he favors measures requiring parental consent
for a minor's abortion as long as children are given the
alternative option of seeking court approval.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who takes a tougher position in support of abortion
rights, was asked to explain the difference of opinion. He said he
could support some version of legislation requiring only that a
parent be notified before minor's abortion, but hasn't seen a
version that's workable.
</P>
<P>
   ''If there is a formulation that allows, below a certain age, a
set of safety valves that actually work, I'd be willing to consider
it and look at them. But I haven't seen it,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Aides said he has long opposed consent requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Both sought to minimize any difference.
</P>
<P>
   ''The important point here is a big and honest difference,''
said Lieberman. ''We support a woman's right to choose. The other
ticket does not.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue is a touchy one for Gore, who is striving to solidify
support among core groups such as women and who argued that his
administration would uphold abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not going to support anything that becomes an attack on a
woman's right to choose,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Lieberman also had to explain their differing views on
school vouchers. Lieberman has supported experimental programs that
would allow public funds to be spent to educate children in private
schools. Gore strongly opposes such programs.
</P>
<P>
   At the opening event Wednesday in Gore's hometown of Carthage,
Tenn., a retired teacher asked Lieberman to defend his support for
vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman said he's backed only experimental voucher programs.
</P>
<P>
   ''The differences are very, very few. We share values, we share
a vision for the country,'' he said, adding that he preferred to
focus instead ''on all of those other things Al Gore and I agree
on.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not afraid to have a vice president who disagrees with me
on some issues,'' said Gore. ''Our administration will be opposed
to private school vouchers.''

Sri Lanka Prime Minister Retires
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) -- Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike, the first
woman elected head of government, retired from office Thursday at the age of 84.
The decision allows her daughter, the president, to reorganize the Cabinet ahead
of elections. Bandaranaike, the mother of President Chandrika Kumaratunga, has
been a dominant force in Sri Lankan politics for four decades but has been in
ill health for months and had canceled most public appearances. Mrs.
Bandaranaike set a pattern when she first assumed the leadership of Sri Lanka in
1959. She was followed by the region's most towering figure in the last 30 years
-- male or female -- India's Indira Gandhi, who became prime minister in 1966.

Iraqi officials waited with nervous excitement Thursday for Chavez to start a
visit that has delighted President Saddam Hussein. The Iraqi Foreign Ministry
has pulled out all the stops for the Venezuelan leader, hailing him as ''a dear
guest'' whose visit is ''another slap in the face of American rulers ... for

<HEADLINE> Reform Fued Heats Up at Convention  </HEADLINE>
By SCOTT LINDLAW
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- A deeply fractured Reform Party
formally opens its convention Thursday with one faction battling
against candidate Pat Buchanan and threatening to hold a breakaway
gathering nearby.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-Buchanan forces also were preparing to ask federal
elections officials to block him from receiving the $12.5 million
that comes with the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ''The papers are on a plane to Washington,'' said Jim Mangia,
head of the contingent trying to stop Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   The split that began Tuesday with Mangia's faction storming out
to name its own national committee members widened on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Each side issued separate credentials to party members it
certified as ''true'' delegates.
</P>
<P>
   The composition of the delegation is crucial because while the
nominee will be decided by mail-in voting, the convention can
overrule the balloting with a two-thirds vote of the delegates.
</P>
<P>
   By late Wednesday, Buchanan's campaign claimed to control 410 of
the 596 delegates, while Mangia's side said it would reach about
400.
</P>
<P>
   Each contingent predicted that when the anti-Buchanan delegates
arrived at the convention Thursday, they would be refused seating.
</P>
<P>
   Mangia rented a hall down the street from the convention hall
and said if his loyalists are turned away, they will march to that
arena to stage their own nominating convention.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan backers dismissed the prospect of a rival convention,
saying it would be meaningless and that Buchanan would be affirmed
as the party's nominee.
</P>
<P>
   ''Fine, that means the losers are meeting,'' said K.B. Forbes, a
Buchanan campaign spokesman. ''It doesn't mean anything. It's
insignificant. This is the real convention.''
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of dueling conventions raised the likelihood of two
nominees, an outcome that would throw into question who is entitled
to the $12.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan opponents back John Hagelin, a nuclear physicist who
also is running for president in the Natural Law Party.
</P>
<P>
   In another twist, Hagelin is scheduled to address the original
convention controlled by Buchanan, but Buchanan will not.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan aides say he wants to project an image as a winner, and
will only give an acceptance speech on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Hagelin could choose to address the breakaway convention, or
both.
</P>
<P>
   ''The whole thing is sandy ground,'' said Hagelin spokesman Bob
Roth.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint to the Federal Elections Commission asks the panel
to decline to recognize Buchanan as the winner and to deny him the
$12.5 million in federal funds.
</P>
<P>
   ''The FEC will have to decide who is the nominee of the party,''
said former party chairman Russ Verney, a Hagelin backer, adding
that the money matter may eventually have to be resolved by a
judge. ''A court will decide custody of the $12.5 million.''
</P>
<P>
   Hagelin backers are also considering other legal action in state
and federal courts.
</P>
<P>
   As the sides shouted at one another Wednesday, Buchanan
dismissed the ''little tiffs'' between factions as sour grapes from
longtime party members seeing their clout disappear.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think you'll see, just by yourselves, taking a look at the
energy and fire and the numbers here, this nomination belongs to
us,'' Buchanan told a few hundred chanting supporters gathered at
his hotel.

Wednesday. The number of reports has steadily shrunk since 1973, after Vietnam
said it returned all American prisoners of war, with only one alleged sighting
for all of last year. Washington is urging Vietnam to conduct more unilateral
searches, particularly in central Vietnam where some of the fiercest fighting
took place. Those would supplement monthlong joint operations now held five or

Cheaper Prozac To Come in 2001
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Consumers will be able to buy a less expensive, generic form
of the popular antidepressant Prozac by next August as a result of a federal
court ruling that dashes Eli Lilly and Co.'s hopes of extending through 2003 the
patent protection on its blockbuster drug. The court's decision on Wednesday is
a major blow to Lilly, which counts on Prozac for about a quarter of its total
sales and had sought to defend itself from competitors for two more years. The
ruling is beneficial not only for consumers, but for generic drugmaker Barr
Laboratories Inc., which has battled Lilly over its Prozac patent since 1996.

Indians Beat Rangers 6-4
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Kenny Lofton's three hits sparked the top of Cleveland's
batting order Wednesday night and the Indians inched closer in the AL wild-card
race with a 6-4 victory over the Texas Rangers. Lofton went 3-for-3, drove in
two runs and scored twice in the leadoff spot as the Indians won for the seventh
time in eight games. Omar Vizquel and Roberto Alomar, Cleveland's Nos. 2 and 3
hitters did their share, as the trio went 5-for-7 with five RBIs, three runs,
three sacrifices and two walks. The win, coupled with Oakland's 12-1 loss at New
York, moved the Indians within 1&AMP;frac12; games of the Athletics for the playoff
wild card.

<HEADLINE> Sandeno, Carvin Claim Olympic Berths  </HEADLINE>
By BETH HARRIS
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Chad Carvin lunged for the wall, not knowing
if he was first or second.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't matter. He was a winner either way.
</P>
<P>
   Carvin, who couldn't compete for a spot in the Atlanta Games
four years ago because of a serious heart ailment, earned his first
Olympic berth Wednesday night at the U.S. trials, even though he
was edged at the finish of the 400-meter freestyle by Klete Keller.
</P>
<P>
   Both men eclipsed a 12-year-old American record, but Keller's
name goes in the book with a time of 3 minutes, 47.18 seconds.
Carvin finished at 3:47.50 to claim the other Olympic berth.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was filled with so much emotion,'' Carvin said. ''All I've
gone through flashed before me.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the final of the women's 100 butterfly is shaping up
as an epic race between former training partners Dara Torres and
Jenny Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   The 33-year-old Torres, making a remarkable comeback after
retiring for seven years, eclipsed Thompson's American record in
the preliminaries, bringing the crowd at the Indiana University
Natatorium to its feet with a time of 57.58.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, whose previous mark of 57.88 was set last August, just
missed reclaiming the record in the evening semifinals at 57.59,
but that was still good enough to make her the fastest qualifier
for Thursday night's final. Torres, swimming in a different
semifinal heat, coasted to second at 58.07.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was told to chill,'' said Torres, relaying her prerace
instructions from coach Richard Quick. ''He told me it's an
eight-day meet. Try to act like a veteran and not go as fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, it's time for the showdown between two swimmers who trained
together at Stanford after Torres began her comeback in July 1999.
By December, Quick split them up because the intensity of their
workouts made every day seem like a mini-Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ''Things can get intense when you've got two swimmers going
after exactly the same thing, and there's only one thing out there
-- the gold medal,'' Torres said. ''But it's not like we're
enemies.''
</P>
<P>
   Torres is trying to become the first American woman to swim in
four Olympic Games. Her first was 16 years ago in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson is a five-time gold medalist, but all have come as part
of relay teams. She was a major disappointment at the 1996 trials,
failing to qualify in any of her individual events.
</P>
<P>
   Carvin, 26, couldn't even get in the water four years ago. He
tried to watch the trials on television while resting at his
parents' home in California, but quickly gave up.
</P>
<P>
   ''I broke down in tears,'' he said. ''I couldn't even make it
through the first day.''
</P>
<P>
   A few months earlier, tests revealed a condition known as viral
cardiomyopathy, which limits the amount of oxygen reaching the
heart. In Carvin's case, he was receiving only about half the
required amount.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors feared the swimmer might need a transplant and ordered
him to stop all strenuous activity for three months. Instead of
training for the Olympic trials, Carvin found himself parking in
handicapped spaces.
</P>
<P>
   After fighting off the virus, Carvin began training for Sydney.
But he endured another medical mishap in 1998, when a bulging disc
in his back forced him out of the world championships.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was probably more down and out the second time,'' Carvin
said. ''I had worked so hard and overcome so much.''
</P>
<P>
   Keller, an 18-year-old from Phoenix, broke the American mark of
3:48.06 set by Matt Cetlinski in the 1988 Olympic trials. Carvin
led most of the race, but Keller was nearly stroke-for-stroke over
the final 50 meters before reaching the wall first.
</P>
<P>
   ''I like to take it out kind of easy,'' Keller said. ''I want to
be relaxed and see how I feel, then take it home at the end. I knew
I had the strength to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Carvin didn't mind a bit.
</P>
<P>
   ''This meet is not about winning,'' he said. ''It's about making
the team and having a shot at Sydney. That's the ultimate goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Keller and Carver will be going up against Ian Thorpe of
Australia, whose world-record time is nearly six seconds faster
than the American record.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're the best America has to offer,'' Keller said. ''I think
people will be surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   Keller isn't the only teen-ager headed to the Olympics. Kaitlin
Sandeno, 17, of Lake Forest, Calif., led the entire way in the 400
individual medley and won in 4:40.91 -- the world's third-fastest
time this year.
</P>
<P>
   Maddy Crippen, 20, of Philadelphia took the second Olympic spot
in 4:42.81.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm going to be missing a month of high school,'' said
Sandeno, who's dominated the event nationally for three years.
''But I think it's a good excuse.''
</P>
<P>
   In the semifinals of the men's 100 breaststroke, Ed Moses of
Burke, Va., was the fastest qualifier (1:00.99) for Thursday
night's final. Auburn teammates Pat Calhoun and David Denniston
were 2-3 in the semis.

<HEADLINE> TV Convention Intermission Over  </HEADLINE>
By FRAZIER MOORE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Bill Maher was lampooning the Republican
National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   ''The whole theme was inclusiveness,'' said the ''Politically
Incorrect'' host. ''But they took this too far. Tonight's
benediction was by the naked gay guy from 'Survivor.'''
</P>
<P>
   Very funny. Now, during the intermission between last week's
shindig in Philadelphia and next week's Democratic whoop-de-do in
Los Angeles, who can resist drawing further parallels between TV's
political coverage and more popular programming?
</P>
<P>
   Imagine ''Political Survivor,'' where the ballots are parchment
and the top vote-getter vanishes from sight. (''The tribe has
spoken....'')
</P>
<P>
   Imagine politicians' big-money game show, ''Who Wants to Build a
Multimillion-Dollar Campaign War Chest?''
</P>
<P>
   And come to think of it, the harmonious display at the
Republican convention could have been directed by ''Big Brother''
houseguest Brittany, the show's cuddle queen.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, there's a fundamental difference between
so-called ''reality TV'' and what viewers typically see at the
conventions. On ''Survivor'' and ''Big Brother,'' the action is
unscripted and no one knows until the end who's going to win.
</P>
<P>
   Is anything as it appears to be at the modern political
convention? Last Thursday, Fox News Channel's Brit Hume dashed a
reasonable assumption: that the people in the hall are listening.
</P>
<P>
   ''Anybody who's ever been out on a convention floor knows that
only the major speakers -- and only when they're doing very well --
are rewarded with silence,'' Hume told viewers. ''The place is a
terrific racket. Nobody pays attention to almost any of the
speeches.''
</P>
<P>
   So let's get this straight: The Republicans or Democrats mount a
big, expensive showcase where no business is conducted, where the
delegates are extras, and the only delegation that pays any
attention is the press corps.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the real focus of all this artifice -- namely,
television -- looks upon it with a jaundiced eye. That's because the
geniuses who package these conventions forget the first rule of TV:
Tell a gripping tale.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder a repeat of NBC's cops-and-firefighters drama ''Third
Watch'' drew more viewers than either ABC's hour of prime-time
coverage or CBS' ''48 Hours'' newsmagazine, half of which was
devoted to the convention, on opening night.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the Republican convention four years ago gave
viewers one galvanizing interlude: Elizabeth Dole, the candidate's
wife, stole the show by stepping from the podium and strolling down
on the floor among the delegates.
</P>
<P>
   It was the very definition of drama, a performance that
commanded the willing suspension of disbelief by her audience as
Mrs. Dole delivered (with well-rehearsed precision) what were meant
to seem like off-the-cuff remarks. And it introduced legitimate
suspense: Would she stumble descending the steep podium steps?
</P>
<P>
   Nothing nearly that theatrical happened last week. Instead,
these were the major developments:
</P>
<P>
   -- The newfangled Internet coverage that spawned the term
''e-convention'' (a media story, not a political story).
</P>
<P>
   -- President Ford's stroke (a human-interest story, not a
political story).
</P>
<P>
   -- The diversity of the convention's participants (an
image-making story, not a political story).
</P>
<P>
   But we're only half done. What will happen during Act II next
week?
</P>
<P>
   Who cares?
</P>
<P>
   If you do, you'll have uninterrupted coverage of the Democratic
National Convention on C-SPAN or, if you don't have cable, on PBS.
Of course, the cable news networks will be in Los Angeles to carry
some of the convention and talk the rest of it to death.
</P>
<P>
   But what role should the three broadcast networks be playing?
The news divisions of ABC, CBS and NBC continue to search for their
proper place in a world of more and more news outlets.
</P>
<P>
   For NBC, the challenge is minimized. Often, news the broadcast
network can't or won't accommodate finds refuge on its cable
sister, MSNBC.
</P>
<P>
   But the other networks don't have cable surrogates. For each
convention, ABC and CBS deploy their sizable resources just to
service their regular newscasts, then to squeeze out their
prime-time reports.
</P>
<P>
   And for what purpose? To memorialize a bygone era, when a
convention made news and the three networks' coverage swamped prime
time each night?
</P>
<P>
   To maintain their stake in the overriding saga of the '00
election year?
</P>
<P>
   Just to keep up appearances?

<HEADLINE> Stocks Fall on Earnings Fears  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed Thursday on fears that
earnings will decline during the second half of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   In late morning on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average
was up 12.46 at 10,918.29.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were lower.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 1.16 at 1,471.71, and
the Nasdaq composite index was down 16.29 at 3,837.21.
</P>
<P>
   Trading was marked by caution as fears that earnings could slow
in the second half of 2000 re-emerged as a factor.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of semiconductor equipment maker Applied Materials fell
25 cents to $71.875 on Thursday despite reporting third-quarter
earnings that beat Wall Street's expectations.
</P>
<P>
   And Gap stock was down $4.312 at $26.938 after announcing
second-half earnings might be lower than earlier predictions.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. stock markets are extending a recent pattern in which
blue chip and technology stocks rise and fall on alternate days.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, blue chips fell, dragged down by a selloff in drug
stocks following a court ruling that could speed up the sale of a
generic version of the antidepressant drug Prozac.
</P>
<P>
   Tech stocks rose, meanwhile, after widely held bellwether Cisco
Systems announced solid quarterly earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Internet stocks lagged Thursday following two broadsides this
week from Wall Street analysts.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, influential Merrill Lynch analyst Henry Blodgett said
he believes 75 percent of existing Internet companies will fold or
merge into other companies in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
   And on Wednesday, a Sanford Bernstein analyst initiated coverage
of Internet retailer Amazon.com at a rating of underperform,
meaning the analyst doesn't expect Amazon's stock to perform as
well as the broader market. Amazon shares were unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   Market watchers say the alternating trading pattern should
continue until investors get a clearer idea as to whether Federal
Reserve Board policy makers intend to raise interest rates at their
next meeting Aug. 22.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues slightly outnumbered advancers on the New York
Stock Exchange, where volume came to 324.95 million shares.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index fell 2.17 to 505.33.

<HEADLINE> Reports Sees China Nuke Buildup  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A new U.S. intelligence report predicts China
would accelerate its nuclear arms buildup if the United States
erected a national defense against long-range missiles.
</P>
<P>
   The prediction, in a classified report known as a National
Intelligence Estimate, was disclosed Wednesday by U.S. officials
speaking on condition of anonymity. They said it is part of a
broader assessment of how foreign countries might respond to a U.S.
decision to go ahead with a national missile defense.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has said he would decide soon whether to
authorize the initial steps toward deploying a network of missile
interceptors, missile-tracking radars and battle management
computers to defend all 50 states against a small-scale nuclear
attack. China is among the few nations capable of a nuclear strike
on the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In making his decision, Clinton has said he would take into
account four main factors: the urgency of the missile threat, the
cost of a missile defense, the feasibility of building a reliable
defense and the implications for U.S. foreign policy, including
responses from China and other nations.
</P>
<P>
   China and Russia are strongly opposed to the U.S. plan, arguing
it would undercut the deterrent value of their nuclear arsenals,
violate the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty and undermine global
stability. As well, many U.S. allies in Europe are leery.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and his national security aides have tried, with little
apparent success, to convince China's leaders that a U.S. national
missile defense would not be directed against China's nuclear
missile capability. A defensive system, they contend, would be for
''rogue'' nations like North Korea and Iran that are pursuing
intercontinental ballistic missile technologies and might not be
deterred by U.S. nuclear threats.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, an unclassified CIA report released Wednesday said
China increased its missile technology assistance to Pakistan last
year and also had a hand in missile development in North Korea,
Iran and Libya. The report said, ''The Chinese have taken a very
narrow interpretation of their nonproliferation commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   In Islamabad, Pakistani Foreign Minister Abdul Sattar denied
that China was aiding his country's missile program.
</P>
<P>
   The spread of missile technology is at the heart of the Clinton
administration's justification for developing a missile defense.
</P>
<P>
   The fear is not only of an attack but also of the possibility
that a country like Iraq -- if armed with a missile capable of
striking a U.S. city -- might try to use the threat of an attack to
persuade the United States to stay out of a regional crisis such as
a conflict in the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials who are familiar with the classified intelligence
report said it states that China plans to increase its nuclear
arsenal regardless of U.S. national missile defense plans. However,
it adds that the increase likely would be sped up if a missile
defense were built.
</P>
<P>
   ''Would they probably accelerate it? Yes,'' said one official.
</P>
<P>
   Additions to China's nuclear arsenal probably would be modest,
the report said, and designed to give China a numerical edge over
the U.S. missile defense system, which in its initial configuration
might overcome a couple dozen incoming missiles.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times reported Thursday that the intelligence
report estimates that China might increase its arsenal of
intercontinental ballistic missiles from the current 20 to as many
as 200 by 2015, and that this might prompt India and Pakistan to
respond with their own nuclear arms buildups.
</P>
<P>
   The Times also said the report predicts that deployment of a
U.S. national missile defense could prompt Russia to resume placing
multiple warheads on missiles that now carry only one -- a practice
Russia agreed to stop as part of the START II nuclear arms
reduction pact that it ratified this year.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA said last year that China has about 20 long-range
nuclear missiles capable of reaching any part of U.S. territory. It
said then that China was likely to test within the next several
years a longer range missile capable of being fired from a mobile
platform, and that it would be targeted mainly at the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   The classified report also affirms an intelligence estimate of
September 1999 that the United States most likely will face a
missile threat by 2015 from North Korea, probably from Iran and
possibly from Iraq, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The report also predicts Russia would continue reducing the
number of missiles in its nuclear force, which has been eroded in
recent years by a lack of money. Russian officials have warned that
they would feel compelled to respond to a U.S. missile defense,
possibly by withdrawing from major arms control agreements.

<HEADLINE> Elvis' Death Vigil Going Digital  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) -- The King is going digital on the 23rd
anniversary of his death.
</P>
<P>
   A global audience will be able to go online and tune in to the
annual candlelight vigil that commemorates the Aug. 16, 1977 death
of Elvis Presley, who died at age 42 of heart disease worsened by
drug abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Elvis Presley Enterprises representatives say surveys show about
half of Presley's fans are under age 35 and are more likely to be
connected to the Internet than older fans.
</P>
<P>
   The Tuesday event, billed as a ''vigilcast,'' will be broadcast
on a Web site launched Wednesday (www.elvis-presley.com). Cameras
will be set up on the grounds of Graceland and in the plaza across
the street from the Presley estate.
</P>
<P>
   The new Web site welcomes visitors with a videolike montage of
Elvis performing decade-by-decade with introductory audio of his
'50s hit ''Hound Dog.''
</P>
<P>
   The vigil attracts crowds of up to 50,000 people.

Removing zoning obstacles to houses of worship
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A coalition of more than 80 religious and
legal advocacy groups, from liberal to conservative, support
legislation that would make it harder to use zoning rules to
prevent building houses of worship.
</P>
<P>
   Zoning regulations cannot ''place a substantial burden on
exercise of religion'' unless local officials show a compelling
governmental objective, according to the Religious Land Use and
Institutionalized Persons Act, which was passed by both houses of
Congress on July 27. It is expected to be signed into law by
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also seeks to ensure that people in institutions like
mental hospitals and prisons can practice their faith freely.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters include the American Jewish Congress, the Christian
Legal Society, the Baptist Joint Committee, Americans United for
Separation of Church and State, the Family Research Council and the
American Civil Liberties Union.
</P>
<P>
   Zoning conflicts involving houses of worship have become
contentious across the nation in the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   Muslim leaders in Culver City, Calif., for example, ran into
complaints about everything from the possibility of traffic
congestion to sun glare off the marble when they tried to build a
mosque.
</P>
<P>
   They eventually built it and opened the doors last year -- but
not before making many concessions.
</P>
<P>
   ''As religious communities, we do encounter situations, not
imposed by cities themselves but by people who reside in the area.
They have certain prejudices and they bring these issues up to give
the city a headache,'' said Usman Madha, community liaison for the
mosque.
</P>
<P>
   The law ''will give leverage to religious groups which we never
had before,'' he said.
AME Zion church delays proposed merger with CME church
</P>
<P>
   GREENSBORO, N.C. (AP) -- Delegates to the African Methodist
Episcopal Zion Church convention have delayed plans to merge with
another historically black denomination until at least 2008.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the AME Zion Church and the Christian Methodist
Episcopal Church had hoped delegates to the AME Zion meeting last
week in Greensboro would approve a plan that calls for the
denominations to merge in 2004.
</P>
<P>
   But delegates voted to delay a merger to give leaders time to
work out details, including what the name of the unified
denomination would be.
</P>
<P>
   ''The name is a problem,'' said Bishop Cecil Bishop of
Charlotte, the senior bishop of the AME Zion Church.
</P>
<P>
   A merger committee proposed that the name of the new
denomination be the Christian Methodist Episcopal Zion Church.
Delegates to the AME Zion meeting objected, saying that ''African''
must be in the name.
</P>
<P>
   Merger would create a denomination of more than 2 million
members. The two denominations are theologically close and have
worked together for years.
</P>
<P>
   The AME Zion Church was formed in 1796 and has more than 1.2
million members, making it the country's second-largest body of
black Methodists, after the African Methodist Episcopal Church.
Members attend 3,100 churches, most of them in North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   The CME Church, with about 800,000 members, was formed in 1870.
Clergy battle casino plan in Wisconsin county
</P>
<P>
   LA CROSSE, Wis. (AP) -- Clergy from a dozen churches have united
against an Indian tribe's plan to open a casino.
</P>
<P>
   The Ho-Chunk Nation has asked the La Crosse County board to hold
a referendum in November on whether to allow the casino. Local
officials have said the Ho-Chunk have discussed paying the county
and city $2 million each annually in lieu of property taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The clergy said they oppose casino gambling for moral and
economic reasons. They plan to form an alliance with businesses,
attend county meetings and advertise their opposition.
</P>
<P>
   The Ho-Chunk issued a statement addressing the moral objections.
</P>
<P>
   ''Even within a single faith, not all members agree on what is a
sin,'' it said. ''That is the purpose of a referendum, to give all
people a voice.''
</P>
<P>
   La Crosse County voters turned down a plan for a casino in an
advisory referendum in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's still a sense the people of the La Crosse area are
opposed,'' said the Rev. Ted Dewald of Trinity Lutheran Church.
''Why is this coming up again?''
Custody case shines light on church practices
</P>
<P>
   RUTHERFORDTON, N.C. (AP) -- In a custody dispute, former members
of The Word of Faith Fellowship accuse church leaders of
restraining children and screaming prayers at them to drive out
demons.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have seen children with bruises on their bodies, scratches
made on their arms, fingernail marks on their arms,'' said former
church member Sheri Nolan.
</P>
<P>
   A hearing, expected to conclude Tuesday, will determine
temporary custody of three children belonging to Ben and Pamela
McGee. Ben McGee left the church and his wife in April; she remains
a member. Their children range in age from 4 to 9.
</P>
<P>
   The fellowship, with an estimated 300 to 400 members, was
established in Rutherford County in 1978. Over the past decade,
former members and neighbors have made allegations that church
elders mistreated children and brainwashed congregants.
</P>
<P>
   The State Bureau of Investigation examined the church five years
ago after more than 40 former members told their stories to news
organizations. The probe concluded without any charges.
</P>
<P>
   Church elders acknowledged that children were paddled, but
denied they were abused.

By RICHARD N. OSTLING
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) -- By most accounts, evangelical
Protestantism is one of the great, growing religious movements
internationally, as it is in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   There was ample evidence of that at ''Amsterdam 2000,'' Billy
Graham's grand assemblage of 10,700 evangelical activists from 209
nations and territories that convened here through last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Underscoring the significance of the event, the Rev. David
Barrett, editor of the forthcoming World Christian Encyclopedia,
estimates the movement now numbers some 210 million.
</P>
<P>
   The conference sharply defined the message, methods and mission
of the evangelicals -- but it failed to clarify key aspects of their
future.
</P>
<P>
   One important unknown is who the top future leaders will be.
</P>
<P>
   It was the last world meeting that will be led by Graham, who at
81 was recovering from surgery and unable to attend. Graham is
preparing to turn his organization over to his son, Franklin.
</P>
<P>
   Franklin, 48, says operations will continue unchanged. But he
acknowledges he's no second Billy, and his conference address was
devoid of any broad or stirring evangelical vision.
</P>
<P>
   Evangelicalism ''became a distinct global reality in the second
half of the 20th century,'' said the ''Amsterdam Declaration,'' a
10-page statement based on conference speeches and strategy
discussions. And the gathering was a nostalgic final bow on the
world stage for those who jump-started evangelicalism after World
War II.
</P>
<P>
   One workshop leader, a Baptist from Ghana, complained that the
average age of main conference speakers was 65. ''Who is taking
over, and why are they not given the opportunity to do things?'' he
wondered.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. John Akers, the program chairman and a top aide to
Graham for 23 years, said Graham wanted seasoned speakers to pass
''the wisdom of one generation on to the next.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham's U.S. staff picked all the participants and speakers,
and thus determined who got exposure from evangelicalism's
deepening talent pool in the non-Western nations.
</P>
<P>
   Akers, a former church history professor, thinks evangelicalism
may be moving away from an era of famous leaders. But he said, ''If
there is a new Billy Graham in the next generation, he is likely to
come from one of the other continents.''
</P>
<P>
   A related issue is whether evangelicalism can develop women
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bright, 78, the retiring founder of Campus Crusade for
Christ, shared the platform with wife Vonette, but the only other
female plenary speaker was Billy's daughter, Anne Graham Lotz, an
evangelist who doesn't feel it's right for women to seek clergy
ordination or bear church authority. However, she accepts that
other women believe differently.
</P>
<P>
   Another fuzzy area is evangelicals' relations with fellow
Christians, about which Amsterdam said next to nothing, as opposed
to other world religions, about which it said much.
</P>
<P>
   The declaration sternly rejected the sort of religious pluralism
promoted by liberal theology and secular society. ''Christ is the
one and only Savior of the world,'' it proclaimed.
</P>
<P>
   Though other religions may have elements of truth, it said,
Jesus is the exclusive way to know God. Hell awaits those who do
not repent of their sins. Everyone everywhere must be evangelized.
The Bible is ''totally true'' and orthodox doctrines are essential.
</P>
<P>
   A speaker from Sri Lanka, which is largely Buddhist, said
preaching only one path may seem arrogant, but ''the real arrogance
is for us to reject what the God of the universe says about
himself'' to fit the cultural mood.
</P>
<P>
   Another speaker, raised in India, told a news conference that
it's simply an illusion to think Hindus or Muslims are not also
evangelizing, or that only Christianity makes exclusive truth
claims.
</P>
<P>
   Intra-Christian relations saw no breakthroughs at the gathering.
Even the prospering Pentecostals and Charismatics, who are part of
evangelicalism, got little platform time.
</P>
<P>
   After Holland's Roman Catholic primate brought greetings and
read from the pope's response to a Graham letter, and a speaker
praised a Catholic missionary, one Brazilian Protestant delegation
went home in protest.
</P>
<P>
   David Neff, editor of the U.S. evangelical magazine Christianity
Today, said the conference, like revivalistic evangelicalism
generally, would have gained by drawing upon non-Protestant riches
such as the spiritual disciplines and ancient church fathers.
</P>
<P>
   Relations with the World Council of Churches, which includes the
Orthodox and a wide spectrum of Protestants, are especially
complicated. Many WCC Protestants are evangelical in outlook. Other
evangelicals remain outside both the Geneva-based WCC and the
Singapore-based World Evangelical Fellowship. Graham and his allies
seek neither a broader evangelical organization to compete with the
WCC, nor closer ties with the council.
</P>
<P>
   At Graham's invitation, the WCC did send one staff observer, the
Rev. Kwame Labi, a Greek Orthodox priest from Ghana. He lamented
the conference's omission of sociopolitical pronouncements, because
matters of social injustice and poverty ''belong to the very
essence of the Gospel.''
</P>
<P>
   Evangelicals say believers should work on those issues, but the
conference kept a narrow focus on evangelism.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Gerald Anderson, retired director of the Overseas
Ministry Study Center in New Haven, Conn., is a United Methodist
and thus part of the WCC constituency. He thinks that as a result
of liberal theology, ''the passion and commitment to world
evangelism has largely disappeared from the heart of the ecumenical
movement'' as represented by the council.
</P>
<P>
   If world Protestantism has a two-party system, Amsterdam 2000
seems to have strengthened the conservative party.

<HEADLINE> Reno Plans White House E-mail Probe  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department will hire a major
university to conduct an independent analysis of the FBI's
''Carnivore'' e-mail surveillance system, Attorney General Janet
Reno said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The university review team will have total access to any
information they need to conduct their review,'' Reno told her
weekly news conference.
</P>
<P>
   The team report will be made public and a review team of top
department officials will ask privacy and law enforcement experts
to comment before making a final recommendation to Reno.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would hope we could do it quickly,'' Reno said.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant Attorney General Steve Colgate, a career official who
is supervising the review and will chair the department review
committee, said Reno might be able to choose a university in 10
days and that final recommendations from the university and from
the department panel might reach her by Dec. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ''Carnivore'' is the name for an FBI system for monitoring
e-mail transmissions that has caused an uproar in Congress and
among privacy and civil liberties advocates.
</P>
<P>
   The system is composed of a computer running the Microsoft
Windows NT operating system and software that scans and captures
''packets,'' the standard unit of Internet traffic, as they travel
through an internet service provider's network. The FBI installs a
Carnivore unit at a provider's network station and configures it to
capture only e-mail going to or from the person under
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   FBI officials say they obtain court orders for the surveillance
and see only those e-mails covered by the orders. But privacy
advocates say only the FBI knows what Carnivore can do, and
Internet providers are not allowed access to the system while it is
installed.
</P>
<P>
   ''As much as possible will be made public, and we will get as
much input from outside as possible,'' Colgate said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Reno and Colgate said that the FBI, state and local law
enforcers and privacy and civil liberties groups will be consulted
not only on the choice of a university and the scope of its review
but also for their reactions to any recommendations from the
university panel.
</P>
<P>
   The university team will have complete access to all hardware
and software involved, including the computer source code for
Carnivore, Colgate said.
</P>
<P>
   The source code, however, is likely to be withheld from the
public, because it is a trade secret of the company that produced
the software, Colgate said. He said the commercial software had
been modified by the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   The department's chief science and technology officer, Donald
Prosnitz, formerly a physicist at the Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory in California, has contacted three major universities
and will probably contact another six before recommending one to
Reno, Colgate said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some folks have volunteered to do this for free,'' Colgate
said. He said Reno would select a university with computer security
and Internet expertise but the school might also bring outside
experts into its review.
</P>
<P>
   Colgate anticipated that among the schools that Prosnitz will
contact is the University of California at San Diego, which he said
had had some preliminary discussions with the FBI about a review
before Reno expanded the review to include officials outside the
FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Reno said Colgate will chair the department panel that analyzes
the university's recommendations for her. Also on that panel will
be FBI Assistant Director Donald Kerr, a nuclear physicist who
heads the FBI laboratory; Prosnitz; Ed Dumont, the Justice
Department's chief privacy officer; and a senior representative of
the department's criminal division.

<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Eric Abbott often finds the sea bewildering. The
coast guard often finds him -- and is getting fed up.
</P>
<P>
   Abbott, 56, called for help Thursday after running aground in
the Rhyl estuary on the north coast of Wales. On Tuesday, he called
for help in the same area after getting lost in the dark.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not giving up,'' Abbott told reporters Thursday. ''Bring
out the champagne.''
</P>
<P>
   The Coastguard and Maritime Agency, which has gone to Abbott's
rescue half a dozen times at an estimated cost of $50,000, was not
inclined to toast his persistence.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are exasperated with him but there is nothing we can do to
stop him going out to sea,'' said Geoff Lunt, a coast guard watch
manager at Holyhead, Wales.
</P>
<P>
   Abbott's sailing career aboard the 24-foot ''Plus VAT'' -- his
protest against value-added tax -- began in Liverpool on July 23,
1999. The next day, Abbott sent a distress call and was towed to
land. The same thing happened the day after that.
</P>
<P>
   Abbott, who is from Northwich, Cheshire, in western England,
didn't call for further help until April 23 when he had to be towed
to shore, and then ran aground later in the day.
</P>
<P>
   On June 18, Abbott radioed Belfast, Northern Ireland, to say he
was lost but thought he could see mountains. ''When we got to him
he had a road map and he said he didn't know how to use his
compass,'' the coast guard noted.
</P>
<P>
   ''I suppose the lifeboat service in the U.K. and in Ireland may
be a bit fed up with me, but really I never mean to get into
trouble,'' Abbott said after his rescue Tuesday. ''When you are out
there on your own, the Irish Sea can be quite a big place. I have
one map but it isn't that detailed.''
</P>
<P>
   The Royal Yacht Association may have a solution: the coast guard
said Thursday that Abbott has accepted the association's offer of a
free place on its 10-day skipper's course.

<HEADLINE> Japan WWII Pilot Defends Military  </HEADLINE>
By GARY SCHAEFER
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's top surviving World War II fighter pilot
has made peace with his former enemies. But as the country prepares
to mark the 55th anniversary of its surrender, Saburo Sakai has yet
to come to terms with some of his countrymen.
</P>
<P>
   That's because the former navy flier, 84, is tired of hearing
that the military alone was responsible for leading Japan into a
devastating war that ended after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima
and Nagasaki 55 years ago this week.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were ordered to go die for victory,'' he said at a news
conference Thursday. ''Instead, some of us came back alive and
defeated, and that's when people began saying that we had started
the war ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Sakai, who shot down 64 enemy aircraft from his Zero fighter
plane, embodies the bitterness that some Japanese veterans feel
toward what has become accepted history in this country.
</P>
<P>
   Though a coterie of military leaders were convicted as war
criminals, the man in whose name Sakai and his comrades fought --
the late Emperor Hirohito -- was officially exonerated. Other key
political figures were later rehabilitated.
</P>
<P>
   Sakai thinks that's a whitewash. He said that Japan will never
be respected by the rest of world until it confronts its past head
on.
</P>
<P>
   ''Who gave the orders for that stupid war?'' he said. ''The
closer you get to the emperor, the fuzzier everything gets.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he doesn't feel any bitterness toward his old enemies,
even though he was wounded four times -- blinding one eye -- and saw
his unit decimated during Japan's defense of Iwo Jima against
American forces in 1945.
</P>
<P>
   ''I pray every day for the souls of my enemies as well as my
comrades,'' he said. ''We all did our best for our respective
countries.''
</P>
<P>
   The war ended with Japan's surrender on Aug. 15, 1945.
</P>
<P>
   Sakai sent his daughter to a university in the United States
''to learn English and democracy.'' She married an American, and he
has two U.S.-born grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Sakai, who has written extensively about his wartime
experiences, insists he never believed in the kamikaze spirit of
self-sacrifice that was drilled into Japanese pilots.
</P>
<P>
   ''Glorifying death was a mistake,'' he said. ''Because I
survived I was able to move on and make friends in the U.S. and
other countries.''

<HEADLINE> Elvis Concert Film To Be Re-Released  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) -- Forget the jumpsuit jokes and all those
fat wannabes. Elvis Presley still had the fire -- and the slim
waistline -- of a rock 'n' roll king when he took to the Las Vegas
stage at age 35.
</P>
<P>
   To ensure Elvis fans and the general public don't forget, the
Presley estate is re-releasing the 1970 concert film ''Elvis,
That's the Way It Is.''
</P>
<P>
   The 97-minute documentary on Presley's Las Vegas concerts will
debut Saturday in Memphis as part of Elvis Tribute Week, the annual
fan pilgrimage to The King's hometown to commemorate the
anniversary of his death, Aug. 16, 1977. The show will air
nationally on Turner Classic Movies on Jan. 8, which would have
been Presley's 65th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   ''He looks absolutely fabulous. He looks in the best shape
you've ever seen him on the screen,'' said Rick Schmidlin, the
film's producer.
</P>
<P>
   An annual candlelight procession past Presley's Graceland grave
will be broadcast on a new Web site -- www.elvis-presley.com --
beginning at 10 p.m. EDT on Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Lou Rawls Stars in 'Me &AMP; Mrs. Jones'  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Get ready for ''Me &AMP; Mrs. Jones'' -- the
musical.
</P>
<P>
   Lou Rawls stars in the stage show based on the real-life story
and hit record about a woman's romance with a judge. The show
begins a nationwide tour next spring with rehearsals starting this
month in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ''Me &AMP; Mrs. Jones'' was produced by songwriters Kenny Gamble and
Leon Huff. Inspiration for a musical came when Rawls guest-starred
in Broadway's ''Smokey Joe's Cafe'' last year.
</P>
<P>
   '''Smokey Joe's Cafe' is based on the huge hits written by
Lieber and Stoller,'' Rawls said Thursday. ''The thought occurred
to me, 'Why not a Gamble and Huff musical?' So, I invited Kenny
Gamble to see one of my shows on Broadway, and he told me to go
ahead and put it together.''
</P>
<P>
   The show is being produced by the newly formed Philadelphia
Sound Co., which recently acquired the musical theatrical rights to
the Gamble and Huff catalog of hits from Warner/Chappell Music.

<HEADLINE> Gael Greene Resigns As Food Critic  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- After three decades of reviewing restaurants for
New York magazine, Gael Greene will finally get to eat in.
</P>
<P>
   Greene, who wrote the magazine's first restaurant review in
October 1968, will step down as a critic next month but will
continue to write about food and restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   She told The New York Times she had sought the change because
she wanted to write longer articles and to do things that people
who do not dine out all the time do.
</P>
<P>
   ''Never got to shop, never got to dinner parties,'' Greene said.
''People think I can't cook. The only time I cook now is when I'm
out of town. That was the thinking behind it: Have a slightly more
normal life, finish my children's book, finish my novel, clean up
the closet, find a loft.''

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Economics Minister Quits  </HEADLINE>
By GEOFF SPENCER
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Indonesia's pro-democracy government
was thrown into further turmoil Thursday by the resignation of the
minister charged with rescuing the ailing economy.
</P>
<P>
   Senior economics minister Kwik Kian Gie quit less than 24 hours
after embattled President Abdurrahman Wahid surrendered day-to-day
administration of the world's fourth most populous nation to Vice
President Megawati Sukarnoputri.
</P>
<P>
   Although a close ally of Megawati, Kwik has been widely
criticized along with Wahid for not ending the financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   As chief architect of economic policy, Kwik has been the
government's prime contact with the International Monetary Fund,
which is overseeing a multibillion-dollar rescue and reform
package.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid empowered the popular but inexperienced Megawati on the
insistence of disgruntled lawmakers who earlier threatened to
impeach him.
</P>
<P>
   In stormy sessions of the national assembly, they complained
that his erratic leadership during the past 10 months had worsened
the many crises facing the sprawling Southeast Asian nation.
</P>
<P>
   Concerns have also been raised about the 60-year-old president's
health. Though he is nearly blind and weakened by a series of
strokes, Wahid maintains he is fit for office.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new arrangement, Megawati will be in charge of a new
and streamlined Cabinet but would be answerable to the president.
Law Minister Yusril Mahendra said the new ministerial lineup would
be announced Aug. 21.
</P>
<P>
   Kwik's resignation, which Wahid accepted on condition he stay on
until the new Cabinet is named, has heightened uncertainty about
how the power-sharing arrangement will work.
</P>
<P>
   ''We still need to clarify some of her executive powers,'' said
Laksamana Sukardi, a former trade minister and close aide to the
vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Although her Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle has the
biggest slice of seats in the assembly and the national parliament,
Megawati, 54, has confined herself to ceremonial duties.
</P>
<P>
   Critics accuse her of lacking ability despite her popularity and
pedigree as the daughter of Indonesia's founding president,
Sukarno. Some question her grasp of the problems facing Indonesia,
citing her failure to negotiate an end to a Muslim-Christian
conflict in the Maluku islands after Wahid named her a special
envoy to the region.
</P>
<P>
   ''Her leadership will now be tested,'' said Salim Said, a
political analyst. ''If it works, that means she could be elected
president in the (2004) elections. But if she fails, she is
finished.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Rewards Prompt Loan Payment  </HEADLINE>
By SONYA ROSS
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- President Clinton offered a simple message here
Thursday: It pays to pay those student loans on time.
</P>
<P>
   At a round-table discussion at DePaul University, Clinton
announced a plan to give lower interest rates to college students
who make their first 12 loan payments promptly, a move that would
save them and their parents roughly $600 million over the next five
years.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was making the changes through an order to the Education
Department. He does not need approval from Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think helping people go to college is number one,'' Clinton
said. ''If I didn't have a chance to go, I wouldn't be here
today.''
</P>
<P>
   The president listened as DePaul's financial aid director, a
computer science major, a mother of three and a newly minted
kindergarten teacher pursuing a master's degree described the
pressures of trying to scrape together enough money for education.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's plan works like this:
</P>
<P>
   Those making new loans directly from the federal student loan
system will receive an immediate interest rebate equal to 1.5
percent of the loan. Students who consolidate existing loans under
the federal student loan system -- and send in the first year's
payments on time -- will get a 0.8 percentage point break in their
interest rate.
</P>
<P>
   The White House estimates that the changes will help 1.7 million
students taking new loans in this coming academic year, and would
save more than $500 annually for a student with $10,000 in loans.
The average undergraduate could save $150 on every $10,000 in
student loans; Over a standard 10-year loan, this rebate amounts to
an interest rate reduction of 0.24 percentage points per year.
</P>
<P>
   ''You don't have to be a math teacher to know that's pretty good
arithmetic,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   He also announced a loan forgiveness effort for college students
who decide to teach at schools in needy urban or rural areas. The
new rule would forgive up to $5,000 in loans to borrowers after
they have taught for five consecutive years.
</P>
<P>
   ''They will be paying it back by teaching our kids. This is an
assignment we cannot afford to fail,'' Clinton said. ''I think it
is a tiny investment for the rest of us as a nation to make.''
</P>
<P>
   The new benefit, which will take effect six months after Clinton
leaves office next year, will only apply to new teachers. Those
with loans taken out before Oct. 1, 1998 are not eligible.
</P>
<P>
   Studies indicate that good payment habits in the first year help
keep students on pace to repay their loans on time. Students who
make their first 12 payments on time are three times more likely to
pay the entire loan back than other borrowers.
</P>
<P>
   A government report last fall found defaults on federal loans to
students were their lowest in more than a decade of tracking: 8.8
percent in fiscal 1997, down from 9.6 percent the year before. The
loans go to students at more than 7,000 vocational schools, college
and universities.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent data available show federal student loans in
1999 totaled $42.9 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Students often take out a combination of federal and private
loans to get through college and advanced schooling.
</P>
<P>
   Four years after receiving their college diplomas, only 16
percent of student borrowers were debt-free, a new federal study of
1993 graduates has found. About half of those surveyed -- 51 percent
-- incurred debt averaging $10,000 each. The debt averaged $66,200
for those who completed a professional degree by 1997.

<HEADLINE> Iran Marriage Age Bill Proposed  </HEADLINE>
By ALI AKBAR DAREINI
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- Iran's parliament is seeking to pass a bill
that would ban girls under 14 and boys under 16 from getting
married without court permission, a lawmaker said Thursday. The
looming debate is shaping up as another clash between hard-liners
and reformers.
</P>
<P>
   Reformist lawmaker Fatemeh Haqiqatjou said a two-thirds majority
in parliament on Wednesday agreed to debate the bill in the
legislature, where hard-liners and reformers confronted each other
on Sunday over easing the nation's restrictive press law.
</P>
<P>
   The debate on the marriage-age bill could set up another clash
between reformist and hard-line members of parliament. Haqiqatjou
said leading hard-line lawmakers oppose the bill. Hard-liners say
the bill contradicts Islamic sharia laws, which they claim allow
girls to be married at 9 and boys at 15.
</P>
<P>
   Reformists disagree.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are many cases of girls forced to marry at the age of 10
or 11 in different parts of Iran, especially in central Iran, which
is harmful to them and creates many social and cultural problems,''
Haqiqatjou told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Haqiqatjou said the bill was expected to be debated and approved
next month. It will then be submitted to the hard-line Guardian
Council for final approval. The Guardian Council must approve all
bills before they become law.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's approval to debate the bill by the reformist
majority legislature came just three days after supreme leader
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei ordered the legislature not to amend the
press law aimed at lifting restrictions on press freedoms. Khamenei
has the final say in state matters.
</P>
<P>
   Iran's hard-line judiciary for the third time in a week
imprisoned a journalist, state-run Tehran radio said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Massoud Behnoud was summoned Wednesday and underwent seven hours
of interrogation before the court issued a temporary arrest warrant
and sent him to Evin Prison, the radio said. It said 85 complaints
had been lodged against Behnoud, but did not reveal the charges.
</P>
<P>
   Hard-liners have banned 25 publications -- all but one
pro-reform.
</P>
<P>
   In February elections, Iranian hard-liners lost control of the
legislature for the first time since the 1979 Islamic revolution.
One of their last undertakings in the previous legislative session
was to force through the press law.
</P>
<P>
   Though they lost control of parliament, the hard-liners still
control the judiciary, military and television network and are
backed by Khamenei, who has the last say on all matters.
</P>
<P>
   Khamenei was not elected, but he has more influence than the
reformist President Mohammad Khatami. Since his 1997 election,
Khatami has promoted social and political reforms.

<P>
   CORPUS CHRISTI, Texas (AP) -- A U.S. Navy helicopter with six
people on board crashed in the Gulf of Mexico on Thursday morning.
Two crew members were rescued from a raft and four were missing.
</P>
<P>
   Several Coast Guard and Navy craft, including three helicopters,
a jet and a patrol boat and the USS Gladiator minesweeper, searched
for the missing crew members Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The two injured were taken to Spohn Memorial Hospital in Corpus
Christi. Their precise condition was not immediately known, but
Coast Guard Lt. Cmdr. Jan Johnson said the injuries were ''critical
enough to warrant being transported directly to a hospital.''
</P>
<P>
   The crew was aboard an H-53 helicopter that crashed about 11
a.m. some 15 nautical miles (roughly 17 miles) offshore, Johnson
said. They were from the HM-15 squadron, which is based at Corpus
Christi Naval Air Station, and typically takes part in
mine-sweeping operations.

<HEADLINE> Pit Bulls Targeted in France  </HEADLINE>
By MORT ROSENBLUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENNEVILLIERS, France (AP) -- Nikita, a pitiful 8-month-old pit
bull, cowered on Biter's Row among the snarling hard cases busted
under a new law aimed at dog breeds branded as natural-born
killers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Look at that gentle face,'' said veterinarian Serge Belais in
the Paris pound's maximum security zone. ''Even if he gets out of
here alive, now he will be mean.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Tie, whose fangs and gaping maw lunged from the
pages of Paris Match after he and four others ripped to death
86-year-old Maria Berthelot on her evening stroll in a placid
village.
</P>
<P>
   France, along with Germany, faces fierce controversy over what
Europeans call a fad from America: growing numbers of people buying
ferocious dogs, for fun or in fear.
</P>
<P>
   ''Pit bull terriers are popular because they're so powerful,''
Belais says, insisting no breed has murder in its genes. ''You
could train a poodle as an attack dog if anyone would take it
seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   But after repeated terrifying attacks from Paris suburbs to the
heart of rural France, a clear majority in this dog-loving nation
is ready to eliminate whole breeds.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a ban on their sale, France has at least 40,000 pit
bull-type dogs and breeders sell clandestine litters at a fast
clip, Belais said.
</P>
<P>
   ''These wackos see Mike Tyson with a pit bull tattooed on his
arm, and they've got to have one,'' he said. ''They pick names like
Saddam, Scud. That ought to tell you something. But cared for
properly, these are very safe pets.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, other experts maintain certain breeds are bred to be
aggressive. If encouraged by training or embittered in puppyhood,
they are tantamount to deadly weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ''No one even counts up the incidents anymore,'' a background
paper to the new law said, ''but there is a general climate of
fear.''
</P>
<P>
   Since January, France requires pit bulls to be castrated,
registered and periodically controlled. They are banned from nearly
all public areas and must be muzzled and held on a leash by an
adult with no criminal record.
</P>
<P>
   Their import and sale are illegal, with the aim of eliminating
banned breeds within a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Jean-Pierre Digard of the French National Center for Scientific
Research dismisses the law as racist, absurd and unenforceable.
Although Paris has a small unit for handling dangerous dogs, few
other municipalities are equipped.
</P>
<P>
   German authorities are debating a similar law, pushed by
outraged public opinion after a pit bull and a Staffordshire bull
terrier killed a 6-year-old boy.
</P>
<P>
   ''Pit bull'' amounts to a broad category that traces back to the
English bull and terrier bred last century as a gladiator, sleek
and short-haired with chunky muscles, to fight other dogs to the
death in a pit.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, they don't merely bite but bear down with broad jaws
of legendary strength and long, sharp fangs.
</P>
<P>
   Americans found them loyal, lovable and laughable. Patch-eyed
''Petey'' in ''Our Gang'' films was a pit bull. So was that RCA
Victor dog, tuned to his master's voice. And the Buster Brown
mascot. Teddy Roosevelt had one in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Rival kennel clubs registered purebreds as the American pit bull
terrier or the American Staffordshire terrier. Cross breeds were
lumped in generically as pit bulls.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1980s, pit bulls evolved as the attack dogs of choice
for social misfits, drug dealers and delinquents on both sides of
the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   Britain banned them in 1991. Now, the new European controversy
feeds an already heated debate in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Gail Goalab of a special dog-bite task force of the American
Veterinary Medical Association said laws aimed at certain types of
dogs are almost impossible to enforce and don't solve the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ''We take a strong position against breed specific
legislation,'' she said. ''Any dog can bite. The responsibility
must be with the owner, not the dog. Ban one breed, and he'll just
get another.''
</P>
<P>
   In France, the new law is less severe with Rottweilers and does
not mention such breeds as Great Danes, German shepherds or bull
mastiffs.
</P>
<P>
   Internet chat rooms devoted to pit bulls rage with vehemence.
</P>
<P>
   One pit bull advocate told a woman of a different view that
people make dogs mean. Fine, she replied, keep the dogs legal and
sterilize the masters.
</P>
<P>
   More thoughtful argument in Europe and the United States
resembles the gun debate: Do dogs kill people, or do people kill
people via their dogs?
</P>
<P>
   ''No question, bad owners are a problem,'' Belais says. ''The
common scenario is some guy gets a dog and then realizes how much
work it is. He chains it out back, maybe forgets to feed it. Beats
it for barking. You can picture the result.''
</P>
<P>
   In such a case, he said, the owner should be responsible.
</P>
<P>
   ''If a Peugeot 205 runs somebody over, do you lock up the car or
the driver? We should punish these morons who use their dogs badly,
but how can you outlaw the dogs themselves?''
</P>
<P>
   The other side points to the numbers: the Centers for Disease
Control in Atlanta found that of 199 fatal dog attacks between 1979
and 1996 in the United States, 70 were by pit bulls, which make up
1 percent of the canine population.
</P>
<P>
   Opinions are often mixed. A Virginia woman told a chat room she
had given loving care to her sweet-tempered pit bull until it bit
her 2-year-old son. The boy needed 489 stitches and nearly lost an
eye.
</P>
<P>
   In the French village of Tonnay-Charente, Bernard Berthelot
knows what he thinks. It was his mother who Tie and four others
killed in June. The dogs had dug their way out of a backyard.
</P>
<P>
   ''The law would be a good start if they enforced it, but they
don't,'' he said. ''You still see these monsters run loose, without
muzzles. There are no good pit bulls, only bad. I'd be happy if
they wiped out the whole damn race.''

<HEADLINE> Chilean Judge Deciding on Pinochet  </HEADLINE>
By EDUARDO GALLARDO
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) -- Judge Juan Guzman may have the legal fate
of Gen. Augusto Pinochet in his hands. Having successfully stripped
Pinochet of his immunity, the soft spoken, strong-willed magistrate
now faces the task of trying the man who once held total power and
retains political and military support.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am not going to say this is a matter of just enforcing
law,'' Guzman said hours after the Supreme Court removed Pinochet's
congressional immunity, at Guzman's request, clearing the way for a
trial on human rights charges.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is a former ruler who has an enormous influence on a large
part of our society, the army included,'' Guzman told reporters
Wednesday at the University of Chile's Law School, where he
attended a seminar.
</P>
<P>
   As he entered the school, hundreds of students gave Guzman a
standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   Hours earlier, still recovering from prostate surgery, Guzman
had resumed work, almost at the same time the Supreme Court voted
14-8 to remove Pinochet's immunity.
</P>
<P>
   That ruling allows Guzman to try Pinochet in one of the worst
cases of human rights abuses during his 17-year rule -- a military
squad known as ''the caravan of death,'' that executed 72 political
prisoners shortly after the 1973 coup that brought him to power.
Nineteen of the victims remain unaccounted for.
</P>
<P>
   Five members of the caravan, including a general, remain
indicted and detained by Guzman.
</P>
<P>
   The judge didn't respond to a request for an interview by the
Associated Press. Interviews with local media are also rare and his
comments usually come from informal talks with reporters who
approach him as he leaves his office.
</P>
<P>
   The son of a prominent Chilean poet and diplomat, Guzman
attended 10 schools in different countries, including the United
States, Venezuela, France and Argentina. He is fluent in English
and French. He and his French wife have two grown daughters.
</P>
<P>
   Guzman, 61, must now decide when and whether to prosecute
Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
   In his meeting at the law school Guzman admitted that a trial of
Pinochet ''is very far away.''
</P>
<P>
   Before making a decision, he must get past several hurdles,
including the Pinochet family's opposition to have the former ruler
examined by doctors to determine whether he is mentally fit to
stand trial. Pinochet, 84, suffers from diabetes, uses a pacemaker
and has had three mild strokes.
</P>
<P>
   Right-wing politicians who visited Pinochet on Wednesday said
the retired general himself opposes any examination, and is willing
to fight in court if necessary. Guzman said the tests are
mandatory.
</P>
<P>
   Guzman also said he would rather question Pinochet in person,
although as a retired general, the former ruler is entitled to be
questioned and respond in writing.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have to worry because the general is a human being and older
than 80,'' Guzman said at the law school. ''In addition to
interpreting the law, we judges have to have compassion.''
</P>
<P>
   Guzman is probing 158 criminal complaints against Pinochet, and
had focused his efforts on trying to determine the fates of more
than 1,000 dissidents who disappeared after being arrested,
including digging in cemeteries in Santiago and elsewhere. No
results were known.
</P>
<P>
   His efforts now center on his ''tremendous responsibility'' in
the Pinochet case.
</P>
<P>
   Those who have worked with Guzman describe him as warm, polite
and compassionate, often comforting people during legal questioning
sessions.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has done much more than we expected,'' said Hugo Gutierrez,
one of the lawyers for the plaintiffs against Pinochet.

<HEADLINE> Russia Probing Rush-Hour Blast  </HEADLINE>
By ANGELA CHARLTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Police were inundated with reports of suspicious
packages and bomb threats Thursday after a blast in downtown Moscow
that killed eight people. Investigators announced no progress in
solving the crime.
</P>
<P>
   Nerves were frayed after the rush-hour blast in a busy
underground passageway Tuesday in Pushkin Square. For many
Muscovites it was a frightening reminder of the apartment bombings
that killed some 300 people in Moscow and two other cities last
September.
</P>
<P>
   Security agents were called in Thursday to examine suspicious
objects found in building entrances and other public places,
including a box at one of Moscow's main airports, Vnukovo. Some
turned out to be filled with garbage; all were deemed harmless,
police said.
</P>
<P>
   A man injured in the bombing died overnight, bringing the death
toll to eight. More than 90 people were injured, the Emergency
Situations Ministry said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Among the injured was a 13-year-old American boy of Russian
descent who was visiting relatives in Moscow. Ilya Yelin, of
Brooklyn, N.Y., was shopping with his mother in the kiosk-lined
passageway when the bomb exploded.
</P>
<P>
   ''I went to buy CDs there and then when I stepped away from the
store the explosion came. I fell and then I got up and grabbed
somebody's hand and we went outside. Then the ambulances came,''
Yelin told Associated Press Television News from his hospital bed.
He suffered burns and lacerations, and was to be released from the
hospital later Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators announced no new arrests or breakthroughs in the
case. Two men who had been questioned Wednesday were being
released, the Interior Ministry press service said. The men had
matched witness descriptions of two who left a bag in the
passageway minutes before the explosion.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities suspect Chechen rebels, who have been fighting
Russian troops in their Caucasus republic since last September. No
one has claimed responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ''All the clues discovered lead to militants in Chechnya, which
is an established fact,'' Deputy chief of the general staff, Gen.
Valery Manilov, told reporters Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The tragedy ''will help mobilize all the resources available''
for destroying the Chechen rebels, Manilov said. The Interior
Ministry press service, however, said it had no evidence confirming
that Chechens were to blame.
</P>
<P>
   Chechen rebel leaders suggested Russian authorities staged the
blast to feed anti-Chechen anger and justify continuing the
military offensive.
</P>
<P>
   A pro-Moscow Chechen leader, Malik Saidullayev, said Thursday
that the bombing was aimed at discrediting President Vladimir Putin
and his law-and-order platform.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's apartment bombings remain unsolved. Authorities also
blamed Chechen rebels for those blasts, which were one of the
justifications Russia cited in resuming its fight in Chechnya after
withdrawing troops in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of people have sought trauma counseling since Tuesday's
blast, officials with the Center for Social and Forensic Medicine
told a local television station. More than 1,000 have sought to
donate blood to those injured.
</P>
<P>
   FBI director Louis Freeh offered help in a phone conversation
with Russian Interior Minister Vladimir Rushailo on Thursday, the
Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   Putin ordered Atomic Energy Minister Yevgeny Adamov to tighten
security at Russia's nuclear facilities in case of new attacks.

<HEADLINE> Blast Kills 11 in Kashmir  </HEADLINE>
By QAISER MIRZA
<TEXT>
<P>
   SRINAGAR, India (AP) -- The guerrilla group that brought hopes of
peace to Kashmir declared war again Thursday, setting off a decoy
grenade that lured policemen and then slaughtering them with a
powerful car bomb. At least 11 people were killed and 19 wounded.
</P>
<P>
   The Hezb-ul Mujahedeen, the main Muslim militant group in this
Himalayan province, claimed responsibility for the attack in which
10 police and one photojournalist died. It was the Pakistan-based
group's first strike since it called off a cease-fire Tuesday and
canceled talks with the Indian government aimed at restoring peace
in the Kashmir Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ''With our cease-fire we showed the Indians that we can be
peace-loving, but with this we have now shown them that we can also
be strong fighters,'' Hezb-ul Mujahedeen spokesman Salim Hashmi
told The Associated Press in the Pakistani capital, Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
   Before Thursday's lethal blast, the guerrillas set off a hand
grenade explosion that drew soldiers and journalists to Lal Chowk,
the business district in Srinagar, the summer capital of
Jammu-Kashmir state. An army colonel and a soldier were hurt in the
first explosion, police said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We took positions in our bunker after the first blast and we
saw many journalists rush to the area,'' said Devanand Thakur, a
guard at the State Bank of India near the blast site.
</P>
<P>
   Ten minutes later, eyewitnesses said, the second explosion
roared out from a car near the bank. Several journalists filming
damage from the first explosion were among the wounded, and other
officers were hurt in addition to the 10 that died.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everything was dark. We could see dust and smoke in the air.
People were running,'' Thakur said.
</P>
<P>
   Mutilated bodies, mangled metal and broken tree branches were
strewn on the street, and motorcycles, cars and a dozen shops were
badly damaged. Some of the wounded wailed as they were taken away
by soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Caps from the dead policemen were strewn on the road, which was
deserted within minutes as shops shut down and terrified people
scurried for cover. Electric wires lay twisted.
</P>
<P>
   Associated Press Television News producer Andrew Drake was
standing with other journalists outside the bank building. When the
second blast erupted, ''soldiers fired in the air and police
cordoned off the area. Fire trucks and ambulances were racing to
the area,'' Drake said. ''Some people were pouring water over the
bodies.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I have removed seven bodies,'' said Manohar Singh, a
paramilitary soldier. ''They were all in uniform.''
</P>
<P>
   Pradeep Bhatia, a photographer for The Hindustan Times, was
killed in the blast, said Satish Kumar, an assistant to the
newspaper's New Delhi-based editor, Vir Sanghvi. Bhatia, 31, whose
heart was pierced by shrapnel, was pronounced dead at the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   In all, at least 20 people were injured, said Jamshied Ahmed, a
doctor at a police control room who performed autopsies. One died
later.
</P>
<P>
   Kashmir, which is divided between India and Pakistan, has been
wracked by a separatist movement since 1989. The various groups of
Muslim militants fighting Indian security forces here want the
Indian-controlled part of Kashmir to break away and remain
independent or merge with Pakistan. The conflict has left 25,000
people dead.
</P>
<P>
   Another of the guerrilla groups, Lashkar-e-Tayyaba, condemned
the latest bombing.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is very easy for us to attack Indian armed forces and their
headquarters and we have always avoided attacks on public places
because we don't want to kill civilians,'' group spokesman Yahya
Mujahed said by telephone from the Pakistani Punjab capital,
Lahore.
</P>
<P>
   Later Thursday, another grenade exploded half a mile away from
the blast site, injuring two women shopping for groceries.
</P>
<P>
   In Baramullah, 40 miles to the north, militants attacked a
border patrol, killing one soldier and injuring another. Police
said the soldiers, angry at being targeted, killed one civilian and
injured five others when they opened fire indiscriminately.
</P>
<P>
   In Jammu, Indian-controlled Kashmir's winter capital, police
arrested a man they said was a Hindu militant working for the
Hezb-ul-Mujahedeen. Bharat Kumar was arrested with two explosive
devices, one of them timed to go off on Aug. 15, India's
independence day, Inspector-General R.V. Raju said.
</P>
<P>
   The day of violence came less than three weeks after the Hezb-ul
Mujahedeen suddenly announced a cease-fire on July 24, angering
other militant groups opposed to talks that did not involve them or
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 1 and 2, nine attacks in southern Kashmir killed 102
people. The Indian government accused smaller militant groups of
launching the attacks in retaliation for the cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   The Hezb-ul Mujahedeen called off the cease-fire on Tuesday,
angered that Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee refused to
involve Pakistan in peace talks.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Mixed on Earnings Fears  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed Thursday on fears that
earnings will decline during the second half of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   In late afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones
industrial average was up 25.28 at 10,931.11.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were lower.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 10.20 at 1,462.67, and
the Nasdaq composite index was down 77.32 at 3,776.18.
</P>
<P>
   Trading was marked by caution as fears that earnings could slow
in the second half of 2000 re-emerged as a factor.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a lot of nervousness in the technology sector. The
valuations are so high in that area that they can brook no
disappointments,'' said Michael Metz, a managing director and
portfolio manager at CIBC World Markets in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of semiconductor equipment maker Applied Materials fell
$2.578 to $69.547 on Thursday despite reporting third-quarter
earnings that beat Wall Street's expectations.
</P>
<P>
   And Gap was down $4.50 at $26.75 after announcing that
second-half earnings might be lower than earlier predictions.
</P>
<P>
   Metz said investor expectations have grown so high during the
decade-long bull market that even companies that meet but fail to
beat Wall Street's earnings targets are being punished.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. stock markets seemed poised to extend a recent pattern in
which blue chip and technology stocks rise and fall on alternate
days.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, blue chips fell, dragged down by a selloff in drug
stocks following a court ruling that could speed up the sale of a
generic version of the antidepressant drug Prozac.
</P>
<P>
   Tech stocks rose, meanwhile, after widely held bellwether Cisco
Systems announced solid quarterly earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Internet stocks lagged Thursday following two broadsides this
week from Wall Street analysts.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, influential Merrill Lynch analyst Henry Blodgett said
he believes 75 percent of existing Internet companies will fold or
merge into other companies in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
   And on Wednesday, a Sanford Bernstein analyst initiated coverage
of Internet retailer Amazon.com at a rating of underperform,
meaning the analyst doesn't expect Amazon's stock to perform as
well as the broader market. Amazon shares were down 43.70 cents at
$30.438, and most other Internet stocks followed suit, notably
Priceline.com, down $1.625 at $24.
</P>
<P>
   Market watchers say the alternating trading pattern should
continue until investors get a clearer idea as to whether Federal
Reserve Board policy makers intend to raise interest rates at their
next meeting Aug. 22.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues slightly outnumbered advancers on the New York
Stock Exchange, where volume came to 751.12 million shares, down
from Wednesday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index fell 4.28 to 503.22.

<HEADLINE> Divers To Seek Treasure off Greece  </HEADLINE>
By ELENA BECATOROS
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- An international team of divers has been
given the go-ahead to search for sunken treasure taken from Greek
Jews by a Nazi officer.
</P>
<P>
   Searchers believe some $2.4 million worth of gold, jewels and
other valuables were aboard a ship scuttled in 1943 by a Nazi SS
officer who demanded payments from Jews to avoid sending them to
death camps.
</P>
<P>
   The officer never kept his promise, and nearly the entire Jewish
community in Greece was wiped out during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The team of 12 divers will begin their search Friday from the
port of Kalamata, 175 miles southeast of Athens. Permission was
granted for a five-day search, which will concentrate on the area
around Skhiza Island off the southwestern tip of the Peloponnese,
port authorities said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Underwater searches -- and even scuba diving expeditions -- are
prohibited without permits in most areas of Greece to avoid the
theft of antiquities.
</P>
<P>
   The reputed treasure was assembled by Max Merten, an SS officer.
Searchers believe Merten sank the ship, apparently intending to
recover the loot later.
</P>
<P>
   Merten returned to Greece in 1958 and was arrested. He was
convicted as a war criminal, but was released under a government
amnesty.
</P>
<P>
   The Central Board of Jewish Communities, one of the search
organizers, got information on the wreck's possible location from a
Greek man who claimed to have been imprisoned with Merten.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty percent of any treasure recovered will belong to Greece.
The rest will be divided between the Jewish board and the
informant. Claims may also be filed by any survivors of those who
died on the ship.

<HEADLINE> McCaffrey To Head New Drug Panel  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- White House drug policy chief Barry McCaffrey
says a panel created by President Clinton must develop more
effective ways to prevent young athletes from turning to
performance-enhancing drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ''Too many athletes still feel they must cheat to compete,''
McCaffrey said Thursday in a statement issued by the Office of
National Drug Control Policy. ''As it stands, we risk creating new
records that cannot be bested without chemical engineering.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the new task force, appointed Wednesday, is charged with
helping the sports community -- from athletes, parents, and coaches
to leagues, governing bodies and international federations --
''develop a comprehensive and effective approach to this problem.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most importantly, we must develop more effective ways to
prevent children from turning to these drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton established the panel on performance-enhancing drugs in
sports and ordered the group to develop better ways for the federal
government to combat the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ''The use of drugs in sports has reached a level that endangers
not just the legitimacy of athletic competition but also the lives
and health of athletes,'' the executive order signed by Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   A study last year found the rate of steroid use has risen 50
percent among young people of both sexes, Clinton noted.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey, various federal agencies and advisory boards will
make appointments to the panel, which will include a separate group
to study the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ''With the Sydney Games just 35 days away, and with only 18
months before the world gathers in Salt Lake City for the 2002
Games, this next phase of U.S leadership is critical,'' McCaffrey
said. ''We owe this to all of today's athletes.''
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey added that ''we have begun to make progress ... still,
much remains to be done. There are too many gaps -- some scientific
and some of commitment -- in existing anti-drug and -doping
programs.''

<HEADLINE> International Custody Case Ends  </HEADLINE>
By FRANCES D'EMILIO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME (AP) -- Two sisters who spent months holed up in the Italian
Embassy in Kuwait during an international custody dispute spent
their first day back in Italy playing in their grandparents' garden
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The family decided to give the girls, aged 13 and 8, a day to
relax before taking them to see doctors on Friday. The older girl
was to be treated for anorexia, which relatives say intensified
during her eight months at the embassy.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're feeling the toll of all those months in the embassy,''
maternal grandmother Odina Grosso said, speaking by telephone from
her home near the northern Piedmont town of Ivrea.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't have the heart to wake them up early today'' for
medical examinations, Grosso said.
</P>
<P>
   The girls and their Italian mother flew to northern Italy early
Thursday, escorted by a diplomat from the Italian Foreign Ministry
who had worked for months to end the custody battle.
</P>
<P>
   The standoff started in January, after the father was granted
custody of the older girl following a 1999 divorce. The father is a
citizen of both Egypt and Italy; the family continued to live in
Kuwait after the divorce.
</P>
<P>
   In January, the older girl fled to the Italian Embassy in Kuwait
City and refused to leave. In June she was joined by her mother,
Stefania Atzori, 33, and younger sister.
</P>
<P>
   At Italy's urging, a Kuwaiti court agreed this week to allow the
children to return to Italy for medical care.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Remiddi, Atzori's lawyer, told The Associated Press that
the older sister was suffering from anorexia.
</P>
<P>
   The grandmother described the girls as being ''cheerful'' on
their first return to Italy since December 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ''The first thing they said was how lovely the house was and
then they asked to see the dogs,'' Grosso said.
</P>
<P>
   Their father, speaking Thursday by telephone from Cairo, told
The Associated Press that he was seeking help from the Egyptian
Foreign Ministry to get his daughters back. The father has refused
to be identified. He said he learned about their departure from
Italian television.
</P>
<P>
   The older girl kept up her studies while living in the embassy,
her grandmother said.
</P>
<P>
   ''She's very resourceful, always studious,'' Grosso said, adding
the girl had passed the necessary school exams to be promoted to
the next grade.
</P>
<P>
   Atzori, who lived in Kuwait for 12 years, accuses her ex-husband
of abusing her and their daughters. He has denied the charge.

<HEADLINE> Polish President OK'd To Run Again  </HEADLINE>
By MONIKA SCISLOWSKA
<TEXT>
<P>
   WARSAW, Poland (AP) -- A Polish court ruled Thursday that
President Aleksander Kwasniewski did not work for the communist-era
secret police, freeing him to run for re-election in October.
</P>
<P>
   The court issued its verdict a day after hearing testimony from
former secret police officers who disputed suggestions in old
police files that Kwasniewski, an ex-communist, worked as an agent
code-named Alek in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am very pleased. Truth and justice triumphed,'' said
Kwasniewski, smiling and looking relieved after a judge read the
verdict.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's ruling was the result of a new law requiring top
officials to declare past links to the secret police. A screening
court must then vet their statements. There is no penalty for
admitting collaboration, but anyone caught lying is barred from
office for 10 years. At least two members of parliament have lost
their posts so far.
</P>
<P>
   Opinion polls indicate Kwasniewski should easily win a second
term in the Oct. 8 election. His challengers include Lech Walesa,
founder of the Solidarity movement that toppled communist rule, who
also has been forced to defend his reputation in the screening
court.
</P>
<P>
   Walesa is due for a third hearing Friday, when a ruling in his
case is expected.
</P>
<P>
   The 2-year-old screening law is being applied to presidential
candidates for the first time. Most of the 20 presidential
candidates have been cleared. But Kwasniewski and Walesa faced
embarrassing public hearings because of old police documents
indicating they worked as agents.
</P>
<P>
   Each man has staunchly denied the allegations and suggested the
evidence was fabricated by political enemies.
</P>
<P>
   Kwasniewski said he believed screening is necessary but that the
law is ''deeply imperfect'' and creates ''absurd situations in
which people are helpless.''
</P>
<P>
   He threatened to call to account whoever ''manipulated the
documents and dates'' used against him, but gave no additional
details.
</P>
<P>
   The spectacle of respected politicians having to fight
allegations in open court has shocked many Poles and sparked a new
debate over Poland's struggle to come to terms with its communist
past.
</P>
<P>
   Walesa, Poland's first popularly elected president after
communist rule collapsed a decade ago, said he supports the law and
expects to be cleared.

<HEADLINE> Germany Wants End to Neo-Nazi Party  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL GEITNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- The government pressed ahead Thursday with efforts
to ban an extreme-right party that has become a magnet for neo-Nazi
skinheads as police questioned one of its youth leaders in the
bombing of a Turkish-owned restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   No one was injured in the early morning blast, which shattered
the glass door of a snack bar in the eastern city of Eisenach. But
the attack sent renewed shudders across Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've never had problems with Germans till now,'' Yilmaz Alkan
said as he surveyed the damage to the business he's run for five
years. ''They're really good customers. But now I'm worried for my
wife and my two children.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the explosion, police took a 19-year-old into
custody after he was spotted near the scene. Police spokesman
Detlef Kasch said the youth, Patrick Wischke, was considered the
prime suspect, but had denied involvement.
</P>
<P>
   Wischke is known to police as the local leader of the youth wing
of the extreme-right National Democratic Party of Germany. He has
been convicted several times for causing bodily harm in fights.
</P>
<P>
   German politicians are considering a ban on the National
Democratic Party of Germany as part of an effort to stem the surge
in neo-Nazi violence.
</P>
<P>
   Electorally insignificant, the party known as the NPD
nonetheless has become the most visible far-right party, through
skinhead rallies and marches. Especially in the depressed, former
communist east, unemployed and disillusioned youth, attracted to
drunken camaraderie, buy into the party's anti-foreigner message.
</P>
<P>
   ''The NPD has completely changed in the past two or three years
from an old man's club to a collecting pool for aggressive
neo-Nazis,'' said Bavarian Interior Minister Guenther Beckstein,
who is leading the push for a ban ''to take away this
crystallization point of the violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Other leaders, however, expressed skepticism about whether a ban
would be effective.
</P>
<P>
   ''One can't ban political muddle-headedness,'' said Hesse state
governor Roland Koch.
</P>
<P>
   After a second telephone conference call Wednesday night, a
state and federal group led by the Interior Ministry in Berlin was
to meet Friday to examine whether to ban the NPD.
</P>
<P>
   Interior Ministry official Brigitte Zypries said a report was
expected by mid-October so a decision could be made at a November
conference.
</P>
<P>
   Shocked by the increasing frequency of xenophobic and
anti-Semitic violence, including bombings and three fatal beatings
so far this year, civic leaders have appealed for police and courts
to crack down on neo-Nazis and for the public to get involved in
thwarting such attacks.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of determination, a court in the Berlin suburb of
Potsdam convicted a 37-year-old man of inciting racial hatred and
using illegal Nazi slogans just 10 hours after he was arrested for
shouting ''Sieg Heil'' and ''Jews out'' from his apartment window
in the middle of the night.
</P>
<P>
   The man was ordered to pay a fine, and was placed on eight
months probation.

<HEADLINE> China Naval Ships To Visit US Ports  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two Chinese naval ships will make port visits
to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, and Everett, Wash., in September as part
of a naval exchange to improve U.S.-China relations, the Pentagon
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Pearl Harbor is headquarters for the U.S. Pacific Fleet. Everett
is the home port for the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier battle group.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the USS Chancellorsville, a U.S. Navy cruiser, made a
port call at Qingdao, China -- the first visit to China, other than
Hong Kong, by an American warship since the U.S. bombing of the
Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia last year.
</P>
<P>
   The exchange of ship visits was worked out in July when Defense
Secretary William Cohen held talks with Chinese leaders in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon said the Qingdao, a Luhu-class guided-missile
destroyer, and the Taicang, a Fuqing-class oiler, will visit Pearl
Harbor Sept. 5-8, and then make a port call in Everett Sept. 14-18.
The senior Chinese naval officer aboard will be Rear Adm. Lu
Fangqiu, the chief of staff of the North Sea fleet.
</P>
<P>
   During the visits, U.S. and Chinese sailors will interact and
take tours of each other's ships, the Pentagon said.

<HEADLINE> Investigators blame deadly fire on careless smoking  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) - A cigarette burning on a living room sofa
caused an apartment fire last month that killed one man and left
three people critically injured.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities were not able to determine which of the three adults
in the second-floor apartment were smoking on the sofa, said
Investigator Ken Heffernan. All three adults were smokers and had
been drinking beer before police discovered the blaze.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nobody really remembers much of anything that led up to the
fire. The events of the fire were real sketchy to them,'' Heffernan
said.
</P>
<P>
   Killed in the fire was 33-year-old Andrew M. Harris.
</P>
<P>
   The three people injured in the fire remained hospitalized
Thursday in serious condition, including a 2-year-old girl.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Harris' brother, Charles, has since said Andrew didn't
smoke.

<HEADLINE> Serb Father, Sons Cleared of Murder  </HEADLINE>
By DRAGAN ILIC
<TEXT>
<P>
   NIS, Yugoslavia (AP) -- A day after their release from a U.S.-run
military prison, a Serb father and his two sons acquitted of
murdering an ethnic Albanian in Kosovo expressed relief at being
free -- but bitterness over 13 months in jail.
</P>
<P>
   ''Gone is the wealth we once had, all we now own are just our
bare lives,'' Miroljub Momcilovic, 60, said Thursday at the home of
friends in Nis, Serbia's third-largest city.
</P>
<P>
   Momcilovic and his sons, Jugoslav, 32, and Boban, 26, were
released from a U.S. Army prison in Kosovo on Wednesday. Instead of
returning home to the province's eastern town of Gnjilane, they
left for Serbia, joining tens of thousands of other Serbs who have
fled Kosovo for fear of persecution by the ethnic Albanian
majority.
</P>
<P>
   Their acquittal weakened arguments that Serbs could not expect a
fair trial in Kosovo. Still, critics say, the three men received
due process only after they became the focus of international
attention.
</P>
<P>
   A judicial panel of four ethnic Albanians and one French judge
acquitted them in the slaying of Afrim Gagica outside their home.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were not guilty and yet we have been persecuted,''
Momcilovic said of the ordeal that began July 10, 1999, when ethnic
Albanians attacked their home and car repair shop. Gagica was among
the attackers, Momcilovic said, as was another wounded Kosovo
Albanian.
</P>
<P>
   Momcilovic believes his family was targeted because they were
well off and their car shop was the ''best for miles around.''
</P>
<P>
   The Momcilovics fired back at their attackers, using arms left
by Yugoslav troops before they retreated from Kosovo, handing the
province over to NATO and U.N. peacekeepers after last year's
78-day NATO bombing of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The shootout in Gnjilane drew the attention of U.S.
peacekeepers, who fired to ''disperse the bandits,'' Momcilovic
said. Then he and his sons were arrested.
</P>
<P>
   After three months, they charged with murdering one Albanian and
wounding another. And, although five security cameras showed the
ethnic Albanians attacking, ''the Albanians claimed the tape had
been rigged, edited,'' Jugoslav Momcilovic said.
</P>
<P>
   While they were jailed, their home and shop were burned and
looted.
</P>
<P>
   ''Not a brick is left standing,'' Gorica Momcilovic, 58, said
with a sigh as she served coffee to visitors. After her husband and
sons were arrested, she fled Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The acquittal came a day after a U.S. soldier testified about
American involvement in the shootout, which occurred in the
American-controlled sector of Kosovo. His testimony and related
evidence showed U.S. troops shot at Gagica.
</P>
<P>
   ''Four NATO soldiers confirmed they had shot at the assailants,
seeking to stop the attack,'' Jugoslav said.
</P>
<P>
   Although acquitted of murder, the three were convicted of
illegal firearms possession and sentenced to time served.

<HEADLINE> State regulators ask for more phone number conservation  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW BRITAIN, Conn. (AP) - To delay the need for a third or
fourth area code in Connecticut, state utility regulators on
Thursday asked the federal government to approve another telephone
number conservation measure.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Public Utility Control asked the Federal
Communications Commission to allow telephone companies with extra
numbers to donate them to other companies.
</P>
<P>
   Such a system has worked in other states for MCI WorldCom and
Focal Communications Inc., the DPUC said.
</P>
<P>
   Starting Oct. 1, the DPUC will implement other methods to
conserve numbers in the 860 area code, such as allotting numbers in
smaller blocks and reassigning numbers that are not being used.
</P>
<P>
   Without conservation, regulators estimate that the 203 and 860
area codes will run out of numbers by next year. When more codes
are needed, Connecticut will use the 959 and 475 area codes.
</P>
<P>
   The state added the 860 area code five years ago because of the
demand for numbers for portable telephones, pagers, beepers, fax
machines and computer modems.

<HEADLINE> 11 people charged with running drug ring  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PHILADELPHIA (AP) - Eleven people from the metropolitan area
were indicted Thursday on charges they conspired to distribute over
100 pounds of methamphetamine from December 1998 to June 1999,
federal and state officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Named in the 21-count indictment were Thomas Hoffner Sr., Thomas
Hoffner Jr., Frank ''Wiggs'' Bennett, Mark Louis Katzin Sr., Gorman
Edward Keehn Sr., William Lees, James Paul Hoffner, Theodore
Weiner, Michael Hoffner, Robert O'Toole and Fame Bartholomew.
</P>
<P>
   Details of the indictment were released by the United States
Attorney's Office, the Drug Enforcement Administration and the
state Attorney General's office.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment charges that Thomas Hoffner Sr., 55, of
Philadelphia controlled and managed a methamphetamine manufacturing
and distribution organization. Frank ''Wiggs'' Bennett, 63, of
Philadelphia, is identified in the indictment as Hoffner's primary
distributor.
</P>
<P>
   According to the indictment, Hoffner used a garage in Havertown,
Delaware County, to conceal and store methamphetamine for
distribution and Bennett obtained methamphetamine from the garage.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Hoffner Jr., 36, of Philadelphia; Gorman Edward Keehn
Sr., 64, of Gloucester Township, N.J.; and Mark Louis Katzin Sr.,
43, of Philadelphia are identified in the indictment as mid-level
distributors of methamphetamine obtained from Bennett.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Hoffner Jr. is charged with distributing the drugs to
Fame Bartholomew, 42; James Paul Hoffner, 30; Theodore Weiner, 45;
and William Lees, 40. All are from Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment alleges that Katzin distributed methamphetamine
to Robert O'Toole, 40, of Philadelphia and Thomas Hoffner Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Hoffner, 35, of Maple Shade, N.J., is alleged to have
used the telephone to arrange the collection of drug sale proceeds.
All of the defendants except O'Toole are charged with using the
telephone to discuss and plan drug transactions.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, the defendants each face sentences of as high as
life in prison and as much as $17.5 million in fines.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment also seeks forfeiture of more than $176,000 in
drug proceeds and property valued at more than $250,000.

<HEADLINE> U.S.: N. Korea Talks Made Progress  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A U.S. envoy made some progress in two days of
talks with North Korea aimed at getting the isolated communist
country to clear its record on terrorism, State Department
spokesman Richard Boucher said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The discussions in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, between
Michael Sheehan, U.S. coordinator for counterterrorism, and Vice
Minister of Foreign Affairs Kim Gye Gwan ''were productive,''
Boucher said. ''They focused on what steps North Korea must take to
end its support for terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   He said there will be additional meetings but no date has been
set. The previous round took place in March in New York.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea is one of seven countries branded by the U.S. State
Department as a sponsor of terrorism. Under U.S. law, this bars all
but humanitarian aid to North Korea and rules out bank loans from
international financial organizations, which are heavily influenced
by Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if North Korea were any closer to coming off the list
after two rounds of talks, Boucher said it was ''hard to judge, day
by day.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the United States would continue to focus on what North
Korea needs to do ''until we see these steps taken.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials reportedly are demanding that North Korea
publicly renounce terrorism and expel all terrorism suspects before
it can be considered for removal from their list.
</P>
<P>
   Boucher said it was a ''major concern'' for the United States
that these suspects find a safe haven in North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Pyongyang was put on the terrorism list because of involvement
in the midair bombing of a South Korean airliner near Burma, now
Myanmar, in 1987. All 115 people on board the Korean Air plane
died.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea has normalized ties with Italy, Australia and the
Philippines this year in gestures apparently aimed at easing
international concerns over the country and facilitating outside
economic aid.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea also is pursuing better relations with the United
States and Japan. Its leader, Kim Jong Il, held an unprecedented
summit in June with South Korean President Kim Dae-jung.

<HEADLINE> Soldiers reap rewards of fighting in Gulf War  </HEADLINE>
By NANCI G. HUTSON
The News-Times
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW MILFORD, Conn. (AP) - When Iraq invaded Kuwait 10 years ago
this month, U.S. Army Reserve specialist Alan Kozlowski of New
Milford was a military newcomer with no idea he might soon be
fighting in a war.
</P>
<P>
   ''I did not expect to go,'' said Kozlowski, a lieutenant with
the U.S. Army 411th Civil Affairs battalion in Danbury who, a
decade ago, served with a military intelligence unit. ''When I got
called up at 1 a.m. on Jan. 21, I had a very sinking feeling about
it. I was scared.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Kozlowski said he had no second thoughts about doing his
duty.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's my job,'' said Kozlowski, now 35, who was trained as a
Polish linguist but during the Gulf War helped maintain a database
for captured enemy documents.
</P>
<P>
   ''They trained us, in the event of war, to go to war, and I
accepted it. And I went,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of Americans went during the months following
the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2, 1990. U.S. jets arrived in
Saudi Arabia within a week, as President Bush vowed to turn back
the attack. The amassing of troops was dubbed Operation Desert
Shield. It turned into Desert Storm on Jan. 16, 1991, when U.S.
planes began bombing Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   A ground attack followed on Feb. 24, and a cease-fire was
declared barely 100 hours later. History books may note the ease
with which the U.S.-led coalition defeated the troops of Iraqi
leader Saddam Hussein. What stands out even more strongly in the
memories of Danbury area residents is the spirit with which
Americans supported the troops.
</P>
<P>
   From the start, Danbury Veteran Affairs Director Patrick Waldron
said he received requests from Boy and Girl Scout troops, school
groups, civic clubs and individuals who wanted to send letters and
packages overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Waldron remembered one touching reunion between a soldier and a
little girl who faithfully corresponded with him until he returned.
</P>
<P>
   ''On one side of the coin, we didn't want to get into another
Vietnam situation,'' he said. ''But on the other side of the coin,
with Saddam Hussein being so aggressive going into Kuwait, with the
oil critical to the United States, we couldn't let that happen,
either.''
</P>
<P>
   Julie Reppenhagen, manager of the Western Connecticut chapter of
the American Red Cross, said her staff and volunteers wore yellow
ribbons throughout the war, and offered support groups to families
of the soldiers. The Red Cross helped get letters and care packages
to soldiers, and provided their families with assistance.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was a lot of support for us folks before we left,'' said
Kozlowski, the Army reservist. ''I know there were organizations
willing to send whatever assistance they could, including personal
hygiene items, to any soldier. A lot of folks wanted our addresses
just to send a card.
</P>
<P>
   ''When we left, we were in very good spirits to go. There was no
worry about a public backlash.''
</P>
<P>
   Danbury Police Officer Peter Tragni, then 27, married, and a
first lieutenant in the U.S. Army Reserves, was vacationing in
South Carolina when he learned of the invasion. Four months later,
in a twist of fate, Tragni was preparing a personal hygiene care
package to send to an American soldier in the Persian Gulf. Before
he could ship it, he learned that he, too, was going to be in need
of those contents.
</P>
<P>
   He said he went to the Persian Gulf without hesitation. Tragni
said he felt he owed the military, and his country, his allegiance
for opportunities they provided including his college education.
</P>
<P>
   Tragni, who was assigned to the 7th Cavalry Division in the
Persian Gulf, is now using his veteran's benefits to cover the cost
of master's degree courses.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is where the rubber hits the road; when you pay back for
all that you have received,'' Tragni said of his willingness to go
to Saudi Arabia with other American troops.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Kozlowski and Tragni recognized that war is dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   One of Kozlowski's lingering memories is of relaxing atop a roof
in Kuwait with a friend when they heard a metal-on-metal explosion.
</P>
<P>
   ''If there was any moment when I felt within a half-hour we were
going to die, that was it,'' he said of the day an Iraqi Scud
missile hit the Air Force barracks and killed several soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   ''We heard the explosion, heard the chemical alarm sirens go
off,'' Kozlowski said, ''and even though we had on our protective
masks, we really thought this was it for us.''
</P>
<P>
   ''To this day, I jump at loud noises,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   What bolstered the spirits of both these young men was the
support they received from home.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody was behind them,'' said Cleo Joseph, commander of
the Veterans of Foreign Wars Post 149 in Danbury. ''We were behind
the troops in Desert Storm. They did a hell of a job over there.
They did it fast, with very few casualties, and they came back
home, and we're happy for that.''
</P>
<P>
   As were Tragni and Kozlowski.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was glad to see the 100 days come to an end,'' Kozlowski
said. ''We did our job. Ultimately, culture shock was starting to
catch up with everybody, and our place was back in the United
States, and that was the general feeling of the reservists. The
quicker it's over, the better. And once it's over, make haste on
getting home.''
</P>
<P>
   In Danbury, the city honored the returning Gulf War veterans
with a welcome home parade in Rogers Park that Tragni described as
the ''highlight of the whole experience.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I was so glad I was one of the ones chosen to go,'' Kozlowski
said. ''To put it this way, it pretty much spelled out my whole
career.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Desert Storm, Kozlowski expected to leave the Army
Reserves after he finished his four years. Afterward, he felt much
differently.
</P>
<P>
   ''I stayed in the Army,'' he said, ''and here I am, talking to
you.''

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Prime Minister Retires  </HEADLINE>
By NAMINI WIJEDASA
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) -- Sirimavo Bandaranaike, the world's
first woman prime minister, retired Thursday at 84, letting her
daughter, the president, appoint a hard-line prime minister in the
fight against Tamil separatists.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe it is time for me to quietly withdraw from the
humdrum of busy political life, to a more tranquil and quiet
environment,'' Bandaranaike said in a letter, ending four decades
of political life.
</P>
<P>
   Bandaranaike's daughter, President Chandrika Kumaratunga,
appointed Ratnasiri Wickramanayaka, 67, prime minister in a bid to
improve her government's image, bruised in trying to resolve the
struggle with the minority Tamils.
</P>
<P>
   Wickramanayaka believes Tamil separatists who have fought a
17-year war for independence need to be wiped out, while
discussions can be held with more moderate Tamils. The war has
killed 62,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   In one of his first interviews after being named prime minister,
Wickramanayaka told The Associated Press: ''Terrorism will have to
be wiped out militarily.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Kumaratunga fell 12 votes short in her attempt to
push a new constitution through Parliament to give Tamils autonomy
-- but not independence -- in the north and east, where most of them
live.
</P>
<P>
   The attempt to give the Tamils, who are Hindus, autonomy angered
senior Buddhist monks and the Sinhalese majority. Buddhism is the
religion of most Sinhalese, who comprise 76 percent of Sri Lanka's
18.6 million people.
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister's post is ceremonial without administrative
powers but it carries political clout with the people.
</P>
<P>
   ''Wickramanayaka, who is a Sinhala Buddhist hawk, can blunt some
of the criticism by the Sinhalese nationalists,'' said Dayan
Jayatilaka, a political analyst,
</P>
<P>
   Bandaranaike also pushed the cause of the Sinhalese Buddhist
majority during her political career, which included three terms as
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Born Sirimavo Ratwatte on April 17, 1916, Bandaranaike was a
member of one of this Indian Ocean island's wealthiest families. In
1940 she married Soloman Dias Bandaranaike, a senior politician in
the United National Party that was governing Sri Lanka, then called
Ceylon.
</P>
<P>
   Breaking away to form his own Sri Lanka Freedom Party, her
husband was elected prime minister in 1956. A deranged Buddhist
monk assassinated him three years later.
</P>
<P>
   Bandaranaike was transformed from shy housewife into a political
dynamo. She campaigned for her husband's party in the 1960
elections and became its leader.
</P>
<P>
   She was elected the first woman head of government on July 20,
1960, six years before Indira Gandhi became India's first woman
prime minister. Her election was so unusual that newspapers weren't
sure what to call her.
</P>
<P>
   ''There will be need for a new word. Presumably, we shall have
to call her a Stateswoman,'' London's Evening News wrote July 21.
''This is the suffragette's dream come true.
</P>
<P>
   In September 1961 at the Neutral Summit Talks in Belgrade,
Yugoslavia, she made history by being the first national leader to
say she was speaking ''as a woman and a mother.''
</P>
<P>
   She governed until 1965, lost the next elections, then regained
power in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   ''She knew her priorities very well and had a foresight,'' said
Jehan Perera, a Sri Lankan political analyst. ''She knew keeping
good relations with big neighbor India was very crucial for a small
country like ours.''
</P>
<P>
   Bandaranaike and Indira Gandhi had a strong personal rapport.
Both lost their husbands at a young age and came from upper class
families.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting a shift toward the left, Bandaranaike ordered the
U.S. Peace Corps out of the country in 1970 and closed the Israeli
Embassy.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1972, Bandaranaike made the country a republic. During
her second term she nationalized private companies, church schools
and newspapers and banned imports.
</P>
<P>
   She used the military to crush a 1971 insurrection by Marxist
rebels, and up to 20,000 are believed to have died.
</P>
<P>
   Parliament expelled her in 1980, accusing her of misusing power
while prime minister, and banned her from office for seven years.
Her civic rights were restored in 1986, and she narrowly lost the
election for the new, more powerful post of president in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Suffering from diabetes and a foot problem that put her in a
wheelchair, Bandaranaike reduced her political activities.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Kumaratunga took over the party's leadership and when
elected president a year later, she appointed her mother prime
minister.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Said To Nix US Refugee Plan  </HEADLINE>
By IBRAHIM BARZAK
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
turned down an American plan to set up a $30 billion international
fund to resettle refugees, a top Palestinian official said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Salim Zanoun, chairman of the PLO Central Council, said the
offer came during last month's summit at the Camp David
presidential retreat outside Washington. He said it was part of
American pressure on Arafat to compromise on the refugee issue.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians are demanding that millions of refugees be
allowed to return to their former homes in what is now Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Rejecting the offer, Arafat ''told the Americans that the issue
of refugees is non-negotiable,'' Zanoun told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Israel is willing to allow a few thousand Palestinian refugees
to be reunited with their families in Israel. The others would
settle in a Palestinian state or in countries where they now live.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians fled during the 1948 war that followed Israel's
creation. They were confined to refugee camps in Egypt, Jordan,
Syria and Lebanon, where many still live with their descendants.
Some of the camps came under Israeli control in 1967, when Israel
captured the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
   Zanoun also said that the Central Council, the PLO's ruling
body, will convene a week before the Sept. 13 deadline for a peace
treaty with Israel to set the date for declaring Palestinian
independence.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat has given conflicting signals on whether he will proclaim
statehood on Sept. 13, even without Israel's blessing, or delay
such a move if a peace agreement has not been reached by then.
</P>
<P>
   During a tour of Europe and the Arab world following the Mideast
summit at Camp David, Arafat did not win unanimous backing for a
unilateral statehood declaration, Zanoun said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some countries told him (Arafat) that they will support the
declaration on Sept. 13, such as Egypt and Saudi Arabia,'' Zanoun
told a news conference in Gaza City. ''Some countries asked him to
give more time to peace talks and resume negotiations before any
declaration.''
</P>
<P>
   Zanoun said the 129-member Central Council would convene in the
first week of September, but did not give an exact date. In its
previous session in early July, the council told the Palestinians
to prepare for statehood by Sept. 13, but the wording of the
decision was vague enough to allow for an extension.
</P>
<P>
   By the first week of September, it will be clearer whether a
peace treaty can be reached.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and the chief Palestinian
negotiator, Ahmed Qureia, said Wednesday that prospects for another
Mideast summit were dim. Qureia said the gaps remain wide on all
issues, including borders of the Palestinian state, the status of
Jerusalem and the fate of Palestinian refugees.

<HEADLINE> Mayor: I'm trying to write a book  </HEADLINE>
By TIMOTHY WILLIAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -He dropped out of the Senate race. He's out as
mayor in 15 months and can't run for re-election. And he says he's
not interested in being governor or taking a cabinet post in a
George W. Bush administration. So what's Rudolph Giuliani gonna do
come next November?
</P>
<P>
   Would you believe write a book?
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the mayor said he's going to do just that, although
he doesn't yet know what it'll be about, or when - or if - he'll
ever finish it.
</P>
<P>
   ''Since I was U.S. Attorney, I think actually it is four or five
different versions that I've started,'' said Giuliani, discussing
the chief hazard of living the writer's life. ''And several times
I've thought about writing a book of different kinds. And now I
think I'd really like to do it. But it's not really more formulated
than that.''
</P>
<P>
   And anyone who thinks that writing is something other than an
extraordinarily humbling pursuit need only listen to Giuliani, a
Type A personality who, let's just say, is loathe to ask for help.
</P>
<P>
   ''I better,'' he said, when asked if he needed a ghostwriter -
or as they say in the publishing world, a ''collaborator.''
</P>
<P>
   ''If I've started it five times and I didn't finish it, I better
get some help.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing seems certain. Giuliani's ''collaborator'' is unlikely
to come from the ranks of the City Hall press corps, who Giuliani
has routinely taken to task for coverage of his administration.
</P>
<P>
   But former Mayor Ed Koch, a three-term mayor and the author of
12 books, was kind enough to offer a bit of advice to Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   ''He should read 'Mayor.' That's the one he should look at,''
said Koch, referring to his 1984 tome that sold 153,000 copies and
was on The New York Times bestseller list for 12 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Koch said he writes his books (eight autobiographies, four
mysteries) only during weekends, in longhand. He also works with a
collaborator, who tapes his musings and gets him thinking by asking
questions.
</P>
<P>
   But Giuliani hasn't taken Koch's advice about being mayor, so
it's unlikely he'll consult him about writing either.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Giuliani's prospects in the publishing industry,
Constance Sayre, director of the publishing trade association group
Marketing Partners International, said it depended on the subject
matter.
</P>
<P>
   A recent book, ''Rudy! An Investigative Biography of Rudolph
Giuliani,'' by Wayne Barrett, alleged that the mayor's father
served prison time for the armed robbery of a milkman and was an
enforcer for his brother-in-law's loan-sharking operation.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor has not denied the allegations, and earlier this week,
said he was aware of some of his father's criminal activity. His
father's past, he said, helped lead him to pursue a career in law
enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a question of what he would write about,'' Sayre said,
wondering if the tightly wound mayor would broach topics such as
his family, prostate cancer and estranged marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ''But,'' she added, ''he'd rile people and ruffle feathers and
generally be a pain, no matter what.''
</P>
<P>
   Which in politics is not so good, but in getting a political
memoir published is absolutely necessary.
</P>
<P>
   The question though, is how big an advance Giuliani would
receive for a tell-all book. Could he get the millions that Gen.
Colin Powell received and that General Electric boss Jack Welch is
getting for his upcoming book? Or would it be closer to the
$100,000 that Koch got for ''Mayor''?
</P>
<P>
   ''For a book that only has possibly regional interest,'' said
Sayre, ''if he gets $100,000, I'd think he'd be doing well.
Although what do I know, publishers are crazy.''

<HEADLINE> More Woe for Zimbabwe White Farmers  </HEADLINE>
By ANGUS SHAW
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) -- The crisis facing Zimbabwe's embattled
white farmers intensified Thursday, when banks cut off their
financing and the government began moving landless blacks to plots
the farmers used to own.
</P>
<P>
   The developments raised fears of food shortages. White farmers
produce nearly half the country's 2.2 million tons of corn, the
staple food, and most of its capital-intensive soy and wheat crops.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is seriously impacting on all operations,'' said Neil
Wright, chief economist at the union that represents much of the
country's white farming minority.
</P>
<P>
   Zimbabwe's government has said it plans to seize more than 3,000
white-owned farms and resettle hundreds of thousands of blacks on
the land. On Thursday, the farmers' union said some poor blacks
were being taken in government vehicles to farms targeted for
seizure.
</P>
<P>
   The union said 24 families were shown plots on two private farms
they were told they could settle near Gweru, 170 miles southwest of
Harare, the capital. The families left the properties, apparently
to return later with their belongings.
</P>
<P>
   The relocations continued a six-month siege of white farmers'
property in Zimbabwe, where the tiny white minority owns about a
third of the productive land.
</P>
<P>
   In February, government-backed squatters started occupying more
than 1,600 white farms, trapping some white farmers in their homes
and attacking others. President Robert Mugabe called the
occupations a legitimate protest against unfair ownership of land,
though opposition leaders said he was just trying to boost his
support among landless blacks in advance of parliamentary
elections.
</P>
<P>
   In the months since, the government has announced its plans to
seize many of the white farms without paying compensation. Farm
owners have 90 days to pack up and go after receiving official
seizure notices.
</P>
<P>
   The names of 800 of the seized farms have been published by the
government, with some having already received official seizure
orders. The remaining 2,200 have not been identified, leaving many
of the country's farmers worried about planting crops they may not
be around to harvest.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, farm leaders and bankers said farmers' loans had
been cut off. Greg Brackenridge, head of the bankers association,
said banks could not give loans without guarantees that farmers
owned their land and would be able to harvest their crops
unhindered.
</P>
<P>
   Without loans for equipment and materials, and with continuing
disruptions, corn growers could lose up to 40 percent of their
harvests next March. Preparations for planting ahead of seasonal
rains in November should now be under way, but in many cases they
are not.
</P>
<P>
   Already farm disruptions have cost Zimbabwe 25 percent of its
current wheat and tobacco production. Tobacco is the largest earner
of desperately needed hard currency.
</P>
<P>
   Wright said large-scale commercial farms owed banks hundreds of
millions of dollars. Farmers whose land is confiscated would be
unable to repay their loans, threatening the future of the
country's economy and its banking sector, the farm union said.

<HEADLINE> Desperate dermatologist says he's been fired  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SCARSDALE, N.Y. (AP) - A doctor who offered $200,000 for a bride
claims he is being fired by Mount Sinai Medical Center for
attracting so much attention.
</P>
<P>
   The notoriety has become ''a nightmare,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Paul Dantzig placed a $3,000 ad in New York magazine last
month offering $200,000 to anyone who could fix him up with the
woman he eventually marries - or, if there's no middleman, to the
woman herself.
</P>
<P>
   Dantzig, 52 and divorced, told The Journal News he is
considering legal action against Mount Sinai. Hospital spokeswoman
Joan Lebow refused to comment Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The dermatologist said this week that he's still single, but has
had some interesting takers. The magazine said he had received 190
responses, plus uncounted e-mails.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Up 3, Nasdaq Ends Down 78  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks closed mixed Thursday as technology
stocks slumped on fears that earnings will decline during the
second half of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average closed up a scant 2.93 at
10,908.76, according to preliminary figures.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were lower.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index finished down 78.35 at 3,775.15, and
the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index fell 11.18 to 1,461.69.
</P>
<P>
   Trading was marked by caution as fears that earnings could slow
in the second half of 2000 re-emerged as a factor.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a lot of nervousness in the technology sector. The
valuations are so high in that area that they can brook no
disappointments,'' said Michael Metz, a managing director and
portfolio manager at CIBC World Markets in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of semiconductor equipment maker Applied Materials fell
$2.875 to $69.25 on Thursday despite reporting third-quarter
earnings that beat Wall Street's expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Applied Material's earnings report helped drag down the entire
sector. Even Cisco Systems, a hero on Wednesday for beating Wall
Street's earnings expectations, was punished, falling $4.438 to
$63.375.
</P>
<P>
   And Gap was down $4.25 at $27 after announcing that second-half
earnings might be lower than earlier predictions.
</P>
<P>
   Metz said investor expectations have grown so high during the
decade-long bull market that even companies that meet but fail to
beat Wall Street's earnings targets are being punished.
</P>
<P>
   A similar dynamic emerged a month ago when bellwether companies
such as Microsoft, Intel and Apple Computer served as catalysts for
tech stocks selloffs despite reporting earnings that either met or
beat Wall Street predictions.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. stock markets have fallen into a pattern in which blue chip
and technology stocks rise and fall on alternate days.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, blue chips fell, dragged down by a selloff in drug
stocks following a court ruling that could speed up the sale of a
generic version of the antidepressant drug Prozac. Tech stocks
rose, meanwhile, on Cisco's solid earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Internet stocks lagged Thursday following two broadsides this
week from Wall Street analysts.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, influential Merrill Lynch analyst Henry Blodgett said
he believes 75 percent of existing Internet companies will fold or
merge into other companies in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
   And on Wednesday, a Sanford Bernstein analyst initiated coverage
of Internet retailer Amazon.com at a rating of underperform,
meaning the analyst doesn't expect Amazon's stock to perform as
well as the broader market. Amazon shares were down 43.70 cents at
$30.438, and most other Internet stocks followed suit, notably
Priceline.com, down $1.875 at $23.75.
</P>
<P>
   Market watchers say the alternating trading pattern should
continue until investors get a clearer idea as to whether Federal
Reserve Board policy makers intend to raise interest rates at their
next meeting Aug. 22.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues slightly outnumbered advancers on the New York
Stock Exchange, where volume came to 936.96 million shares, down
from Wednesday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index fell 4.03 to 502.47.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Suharto Has Brain Scan  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Former dictator Suharto, who is facing
a corruption trial, underwent a brain scan and brief checkup
Thursday, doctors said.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-minute hospital procedure was routine and Suharto then
returned to his Jakarta home, said Dr. Sri Hutari, a supervisor at
Pertamina Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ''He had a brain scan and was examined by doctors. It was
routine and he was not sick. He comes here often for checkups,''
she said, adding that results from Thursday's tests were not
immediately available.
</P>
<P>
   Suharto, 79, ruled Indonesia for three decades, but was forced
from power two years ago by pro-democracy protests.
</P>
<P>
   State prosecutors have charged him with siphoning off at least
$570 million of state funds through a complex network of charities
under his control. Suharto, who like many Indonesians uses one
name, has denied any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors want to put him on trial sometime this month. But
his attorneys say a series of recent strokes have damaged his brain
and he should not be forced into a court room.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, a judge changed Suharto's detention status. He has
been under house arrest since May but will now be allowed to travel
around, but not outside of, Jakarta.

<HEADLINE> Metal Strip Tied to Concorde Crash  </HEADLINE>
By ELAINE GANLEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- A fuel leak that led to the fiery crash of an Air
France Concorde jet was probably caused by a strip of metal left on
the runway where the supersonic jet took off, investigators said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The 16-inch metal piece probably punctured one of the jet's
tires, sending heavy chunks of rubber flying into the jet fuel
tanks.
</P>
<P>
   The debris -- some weighing nine pounds or more -- was projected
outward and damaged one or several fuel reservoirs on the plane's
left wing, causing ''a very important fuel leak and fire,'' said a
statement from the Transport Ministry's Accident and Inquiry
Office.
</P>
<P>
   The statement, which said the plane was traveling at 195.5 mph
at the time the tire burst, shed more light on why the Air France
Concorde crashed outside Paris on July 25, plowing into a hotel and
killing 113 people.
</P>
<P>
   But it said the exact chain of events that brought the plane
down remains to be determined, and that experts still must confirm
their theory that the stray 16-inch-long metal piece was
responsible for the tragedy. It also did not say where the metal
might have come from.
</P>
<P>
   Air France's five remaining supersonic Concorde jetliners have
been grounded since the crash, though British Airways' fleet of
seven Concordes continue to fly.
</P>
<P>
   French Transport Minister Jean-Claude Gayssot has said the Air
France Concordes will not fly again until experts understand
exactly what caused the accident.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators on Thursday resumed gathering debris from the site
where the Concorde plunged into a hotel in the town of Gonesse. The
work had been halted a week ago after cancer-causing asbestos from
the doomed aircraft was found in the engines, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a report in the British publication New Scientist
raised questions about the needle-nosed jet's engines. According to
the publication, a 1998 study commissioned by British Airways shows
55 ''significant risks'' inherent in the design of the Concorde
engines.
</P>
<P>
   The publication quoted a spokeswoman for British Airways as
saying a joint program was under way with Air France to eliminate
risks that could lead to a catastrophe. However, New Scientist
reported that some of the risks identified in the study -- including
uncontrolled fire and multiple engine failure -- figured into last
month's crash.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Gives Economics Lesson  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- President Clinton, whose capacity for discourse
on almost any subject amazes even his close aides, delivered an
impromptu economics lesson Thursday courtesy of an indebted college
student named Heather Ely.
</P>
<P>
   He cited Ely as an example of the many opportunities available
to young people in a booming economy, and an unwitting victim of
success.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that Ely, who will be a senior at DePaul University
this fall, ''actually got hurt by the prosperity of the economy,''
which the president takes large credit for fostering over more than
seven years in office. Clinton spoke at DePaul during a discussion,
arranged by the White House, of education costs.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the $25,000 Ely has borrowed for school so far came from
private bank loans with variable interest rates. She also has low,
fixed-rate federal loans.
</P>
<P>
   During her time in school, interest rates on the variable loans
have shot up, she told the president.
</P>
<P>
   ''I worry how I am going to pay it back when I get out of
school,'' Ely said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton then began a lengthy explanation of why and how interest
rates rise in a good economy and the ''unintended consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   ''What happened was, when the economy started growing so fast,
interest rates went up because there was a lot of competition for
money and because the Federal Reserve got worried about
inflation,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a good thing to have growth without inflation, but if you
have to get it by raising the interest rates, you have all these
unintended consequences,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Although he frequently says he never interferes with the rate
decisions of Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, Clinton apparently could
not resist a small editorial aside.
</P>
<P>
   ''When people raise interest rates, they think, 'I'm going to do
this to slow down the economy, so I'll stop people from buying
optional things, or I'll defer the business loan for expansion,'''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ''But they don't think about people on flexible interest rates,
home mortgages, college loans and things like that, or credit cards
even,'' Clinton continued.
</P>
<P>
   The president then mused about various repayment options open to
Ely and the possible tax consequences. He wondered aloud, and at
some length, whether private bank loans and government loans are
treated the same way under the federal tax code.
</P>
<P>
   His audience, mostly college students, looked a little lost at
this point, but rallied as Clinton wound down.
</P>
<P>
   ''You've actually given me something to go back and look into,''
Clinton said, as Ely shrugged in surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will be something positive to occupy myself with, since I'm
not a candidate this year,'' Clinton said to laughter. ''I need
something good to do in September and October, and I'll do that.''

<HEADLINE> Thousands of striking Verizon workers rally in Manhattan  </HEADLINE>
By FRANK ELTMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Chanting ''C-W-A'' and ''no contract, no work,''
thousands of Verizon Communications workers rallied in Manhattan on
Thursday, calling for a fair contract settlement on the fifth day
of a walkout by 87,200 employees in 12 states and the District of
Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   ''There will be no peace for this renegade corporate giant until
it stops outsourcing good union jobs,'' AFL-CIO President John
Sweeney declared to the boisterous crowd.
</P>
<P>
   The rally outside Verizon headquarters was one of several large
gatherings on Thursday, and more were scheduled for Friday in
Boston, Washington, Baltimore and Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Before climbing aboard a flatbed truck to address the Manhattan
gathering, estimated by police at about 8,000, Sweeney noted that
the CWA walkout could be a harbinger for future labor negotiations.
Verizon, the nation's largest local and wireless telephone company,
was formed by the June merger of Bell Atlantic and GTE.
</P>
<P>
   The unions fear that the company - as it expands its territory -
will shift work to less-expensive areas, reducing the number of
jobs in their existing centers.
</P>
<P>
   ''This company is trying to do things that other companies are
watching to see how successful they are,'' he said. ''These
courageous strikers here are not only striking for their own
issues, but on behalf of workers who are in similar situations
across the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Another speaker yelled from the podium, ''This is the strike of
the 21st century; we are fighting for justice in the new economy.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Sweeney, the strikers heard from Sen. Charles
Schumer, who also read a letter of support from first lady and
Senate candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton. Others addressing the
rally included a bevy of New York City politicians: Public Advocate
Mark Green, Comptroller Alan Hevesi, Bronx Borough President
Fernando Ferrer, state Sen. Thomas Duane, and City Councilwoman
Christine Quinn.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've got five children to support and I'll stay out on strike
as long as it takes to get a contract,'' said John Marceda, an
equipment technician from Valley Stream.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Brown, a customer service representative from the
Bronx, added: ''The issue here is job security. They don't want us
in the Internet and the DSL markets, and that's where the money
is.''
</P>
<P>
   In Albany, about 1,000 workers rallied in front of the state
Capitol, right across from Verizon's offices. ''No CWA worker will
go back to work until we have a contract that says our job will
stay right here in this community,'' said Gil Carey of CWA Local
1118.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth Howard, who works in repair services, said she wished
''they'd hurry up so we can go back to work. We have to do what we
have to do to get what we want.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Ernie Sacco, a field technician in Albany, ''We're just
looking for job security. I want my little boy to have what I
have.''
</P>
<P>
   Following the New York City rally, the operators of nearby
Bryant Park complained that striking workers had damaged flower
beds, chairs and tables and caused customers to skip lunch at the
Bryant Park Grill restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   The park is directly east of the Verizon building and was filled
with overflow demonstrators who didn't fit on the sidewalk outside
the company headquarters on Sixth Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can't be the site of demonstrations meant for the Verizon
building,'' said Dan Biederman of the Bryant Park Restoration Corp.
and Bryant Park Management Corp., which runs the city-owned
facility. He said a sculpture called ''Tar Roses,'' by Dennis
Oppenheim, also was damaged.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our intent in the future is to close the park even if we get
wind of a demonstration,'' Biederman said.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Master, a CWA spokesman, said his membership was told by the
police that they could enter the park. ''Frankly, I guess it never
occurred to us that there would be a problem. Obviously we're very
sorry if any damage was done. I don't know that anything was done
deliberately. We're really sorry.''

<HEADLINE> NASA to Send Two Landers to Mars  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL RECER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- NASA, still recovering from back-to-back Mars
mission failures last year, plans to double up on a 2003 landing
expedition by sending a pair of wheeled robots to search for
evidence of water on the Red Planet.
</P>
<P>
   Two spacecraft, each carrying identical roving robots, will be
launched in 2003 and then bounce, 18 days apart in January 2004, to
beach ball-like landings on Mar, agency officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Sending two spacecraft, officials said, will double the chances
of success and shed more light on fundamental questions about Mars
and the possibility the planet once harbored life.
</P>
<P>
   Two separate Mars exploration craft, including a lander, failed
last year, forcing a reorganization of NASA's Martian program.
</P>
<P>
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration already had
planned to send one robot explorer. But Edward Weiler, head of
NASA's office of space science, said that ''celestial mechanics'' --
an unusual alignment of Mars and the Earth in 2003 -- made a second
mission an attractive and economical option.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you have an opportunity for surface science on Mars, then
maybe it is a good idea to do two landers,'' Weiler said at a news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   Weiler said that in the wake of last year's failures, NASA has
added some new managerial positions and plans to provide more funds
for testing and to solve any problems. For this reason, he said,
the new Mars missions will be ''slightly more expensive'' than
before the reorganization.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, said Scott Hubbard, NASA's Mars program director, the
two missions are a bargain in the field of planetary exploration.
</P>
<P>
   While final figures are being calculated, Hubbard estimated that
building, launching and operating the first rover is expected to
cost $350 million to $400 million. An identical second mission,
which benefits from economies in testing and development, adds
about $200 million.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Garvin, Mars program scientist, said that both of the
sophisticated mobile robots will be able to act as mechanical
geologists, examining and even breaking open rocks to search for
clues to Mars' history. Instruments will analyze the rock chemistry
and a microscopic camera will send close up images back to Earth.
</P>
<P>
   All of this is centered on NASA's Martian exploration theme of
''follow the water,'' Garvin said.
</P>
<P>
   Data from earlier Mars explorations suggest that Mars once had
oceans, rivers and lakes. Recent studies of pictures from a
satellite orbiting Mars even suggests there may still be water just
beneath surface. Experts say that learning the water history is key
to the possibility that life, in some form, once existed on Mars
and could still.
</P>
<P>
   ''One of the engaging mysteries is what happened to the water?''
Garvin said.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Squyres, a Cornell University professor and the principal
scientist for the robot missions, said that the Mars 2003 rovers
each will weigh about 300 pounds. They will have six wheels that
will run by solar-charged electrical power. Each will communicate
independently with Earth, using a pop-up dish antenna.
</P>
<P>
   Pictures collected by the rovers will be relayed immediately to
a Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ''You'll be able to see what we see,'' said Squyres. ''You'll
see a rover's eyeview'' of Mars.
</P>
<P>
   The robots are expected to operate for at least 90 days each.
They are expected to have enough electrical power to roam about 110
yards during each of the Martian days (24 hours, 37 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   Squyres said the robots will have 20/20 color vision from 10
cameras on board each vehicle. One camera will be used for
navigation and will be linked to an onboard computer that will let
the rovers look ahead and plot a wheeled course to specific
destinations. It is so intelligent, he said, that it will avoid
obstacles and try alternate paths without being told.
</P>
<P>
   A single arm on the rover will contain a tool that can break
open rocks and a camera that gives microscopic views of grain-sized
specimens.
</P>
<P>
   The rovers will be launched separately from Cape Canaveral Air
Force Station in Florida by Delta 2 rockets. The first is scheduled
for May 22, 2003 and the second on June 4. The launch dates are
dictated by a favorable alignment with Mars that will not be
repeated for six years, Weiler said.
</P>
<P>
   After a trip of 7&AMP;frac12; months, the robots will reach Mars 18 days
apart. They will fall through the Mars atmosphere, protected by
heat shields. At seven miles above the surface, parachutes will
deploy and lower the craft to 1,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, air bags surrounding the robots will inflate and
the spacecraft will drop to the surface.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will bounce and roll for maybe a half mile,'' said Hubbard.
</P>
<P>
   The air bags will deflate and the rovers will roll off on their
own.

<HEADLINE> Court Backs Russia's Paris Embassy  </HEADLINE>
By VERENA VON DERSCHAU
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- A French appeals court on Thursday lifted a freeze
on Russian Embassy bank accounts after a three-month legal battle
that left the embassy struggling to pay its bills.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the embassy said the ruling was a victory for the
diplomatic world, and embassy staff said they would now be able to
get on with their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The legal battle, which further strained France's already
troubled relations with Russia, pitted Russian diplomats against a
Swiss-based company, Noga, that said Russia owed it millions of
dollars from oil-for-food deals signed in 1991, the year the Soviet
Union dissolved, and 1992.
</P>
<P>
   In May, a court froze the accounts of Russia's embassy, trade
representation and delegation to UNESCO at Noga's request.
</P>
<P>
   Russia appealed, and on Thursday the freeze was ordered lifted,
following a recommendation by a government prosecutor. The accounts
hold about $392,000.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a victory, not only for Russia but also for the
diplomatic world,'' said Daniel Guyot, a lawyer for Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ''Good sense and justice have triumphed,'' said Konstantin
Petrichenko, first secretary at the embassy.
</P>
<P>
   ''We could no longer pay our bills, carry out little repairs or
organize diplomatic receptions, concerts or exhibitions as we did
before,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian Foreign Ministry described the decision as ''the
only one possible.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Justice, although belatedly, has been served,'' the ministry
said in a statement. Russia ''considers the question conclusively
settled and removed from the agenda of Russian-French relations.''
</P>
<P>
   Noga, headed by businessman Nessim Gaon, is seeking repayment of
$62 million. Its bid to recoup its money was boosted in 1997 when
an arbitration court in Stockholm, Sweden, backed its claim.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from pinching the embassy's budget, the dispute was a
further irritant in relations between Russia and France, which has
strongly criticized Russia's war in the breakaway region of
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Russia argued the freeze violated treaties on diplomatic rights
and immunity.
</P>
<P>
   The sniping intensified when Noga managed to have a renowned
Russian sailing ship impounded when it came to France last month to
take part in an international regatta. The Sedov was finally
allowed to sail from the northwestern port of Brest after a court
ruled it could not be held for the state's debts.
</P>
<P>
   The Court of Appeals said in its Thursday ruling that Russia had
not shown an ''unequivocal'' desire to renounce its immunity in the
original contracts signed with Noga. The firm argued the former
Soviet Union had renounced all immunity, including diplomatic
immunity.

<HEADLINE> Report: China Might Increase Nukes  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A new U.S. intelligence report predicts China
would accelerate its nuclear arms buildup if the United States
erected a national defense against long-range missiles.
</P>
<P>
   The prediction, in a classified report known as a National
Intelligence Estimate, was disclosed Wednesday by U.S. officials
speaking on condition of anonymity. They said it is part of a
broader assessment of how foreign countries might respond to a U.S.
decision to go ahead with a national missile defense.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has said he would decide soon whether to
authorize the initial steps toward deploying a network of missile
interceptors, missile-tracking radars and battle management
computers to defend all 50 states against a small-scale nuclear
attack. China is among the few nations capable of a nuclear strike
on the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In making his decision, Clinton has said he would take into
account four main factors: the urgency of the missile threat, the
cost of a missile defense, the feasibility of building a reliable
defense and the implications for U.S. foreign policy, including
responses from China and other nations.
</P>
<P>
   China and Russia are strongly opposed to the U.S. plan, arguing
it would undercut the deterrent value of their nuclear arsenals,
violate the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty and undermine global
stability. As well, many U.S. allies in Europe are leery.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and his national security aides have tried, with little
apparent success, to convince China's leaders that a U.S. national
missile defense would not be directed against China's nuclear
missile capability. A defensive system, they contend, would be for
''rogue'' nations like North Korea and Iran that are pursuing
intercontinental ballistic missile technologies and might not be
deterred by U.S. nuclear threats.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, an unclassified CIA report released Wednesday said
China increased its missile technology assistance to Pakistan last
year and also had a hand in missile development in North Korea,
Iran and Libya. The report said, ''The Chinese have taken a very
narrow interpretation of their nonproliferation commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   In Islamabad, Pakistani Foreign Minister Abdul Sattar denied
that China was aiding his country's missile program.
</P>
<P>
   The spread of missile technology is at the heart of the Clinton
administration's justification for developing a missile defense.
</P>
<P>
   The fear is not only of an attack but also of the possibility
that a country like Iraq -- if armed with a missile capable of
striking a U.S. city -- might try to use the threat of an attack to
persuade the United States to stay out of a regional crisis such as
a conflict in the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials who are familiar with the classified intelligence
report said it states that China plans to increase its nuclear
arsenal regardless of U.S. national missile defense plans. However,
it adds that the increase likely would be sped up if a missile
defense were built.
</P>
<P>
   ''Would they probably accelerate it? Yes,'' said one official.
</P>
<P>
   Additions to China's nuclear arsenal probably would be modest,
the report said, and designed to give China a numerical edge over
the U.S. missile defense system, which in its initial configuration
might overcome a couple dozen incoming missiles.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times reported Thursday that the intelligence
report estimates that China might increase its arsenal of
intercontinental ballistic missiles from the current 20 to as many
as 200 by 2015, and that this might prompt India and Pakistan to
respond with their own nuclear arms buildups.
</P>
<P>
   The Times also said the report predicts that deployment of a
U.S. national missile defense could prompt Russia to resume placing
multiple warheads on missiles that now carry only one -- a practice
Russia agreed to stop as part of the START II nuclear arms
reduction pact that it ratified this year.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA said last year that China has about 20 long-range
nuclear missiles capable of reaching any part of U.S. territory. It
said then that China was likely to test within the next several
years a longer range missile capable of being fired from a mobile
platform, and that it would be targeted mainly at the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   The classified report also affirms an intelligence estimate of
September 1999 that the United States most likely will face a
missile threat by 2015 from North Korea, probably from Iran and
possibly from Iraq, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The report also predicts Russia would continue reducing the
number of missiles in its nuclear force, which has been eroded in
recent years by a lack of money. Russian officials have warned that
they would feel compelled to respond to a U.S. missile defense,
possibly by withdrawing from major arms control agreements.

<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Among the 11 people were killed in
Wednesday's collision of two small planes over Burlington Township
were seven civilian employees of the U.S. Navy. They and two crew
members were on a chartered Piper Navajo en route to Patuxent River
Naval Air Station, Md., from Lakehurst Naval Air Engineering
Station.
</P>
<P>
   That aircraft collided with a second plane, a Piper Seminole
from Northeast Philadelphia Airport, carrying a flight instructor
and a student.
</P>
<P>
   Here are brief sketches of the victims:
</P>
<P>
   - Angelo George, 39, of Toms River, managed engineering programs
at the Lakehurst facility. Family friend Dennis McCarthy said
George was ''a wonderful son, friend, husband and father.'' He is
survived by his wife and four daughters - all under the age of 5,
including 1-year-old twins.
</P>
<P>
   ''He really lived life to the fullest. I know that's a cliche,
but it's true,'' said co-worker Dennis Dusenshine, 39. He also
played in a base softball league.
</P>
<P>
   - Cynthia Kovacs, 39, of Robbinsville, was a mechanical engineer
who work on aircraft safety systems, including those designed to
prevent midair collisions. ''It's kind of ironic,'' Dusenshine
said. She survived a 1&AMP;frac12;-year bout with breast cancer, working the
entire time she was undergoing treatment, and was declared
cancer-free in February, said co-worker Pattie Odoardo. ''It's very
heartbreaking ... to see someone survive such a terrible disease
and then go like that,'' Odoardo said.
</P>
<P>
   An avid jogger, Kovacs ran 6 miles a day, sometimes going to the
base gym on her lunch hour or after work. A neighbor, Aurelia
Youngken, said Kovacs was involved in PTA and Little League
activities. She is survived by her husband, Wayne, a 5-year-old son
and a 9-year-old daughter. ''They were her life and joy, her
children,'' said Odoardo.
</P>
<P>
   - Robert Polo, 39, of Barnegat, worked as a logistics management
specialist at the naval station. He is survived by his wife,
Noreen.
</P>
<P>
   - Michael Simodejka, 52, of Toms River, became a logistics
management specialist after leaving the U.S. Army as a captain.
''He was extremely energetic, straightforward in his speech and a
very strong advocate for his people,'' said Capt. Stephen Himes,
commander of the Naval Air Engineering Station. ''He had a
no-nonsense approach, but he was friendly, outgoing and gregarious
on the personal side,'' Himes said.
</P>
<P>
   Simodejka is survived by his wife, Patricia, and two children,
Dawn and Jason.
</P>
<P>
   - John Vail Jr., 36, of Howell, was a program manager. Friends
said Vail did volunteer work, collecting money for the Leukemia
Society of America, and was involved in his parish, St. Catherine
of Siena in Farmingdale. He is survived by his wife, Michelle.
</P>
<P>
   - John Zukow, 56, of Toms River, was an engineering technician.
Friends said Wednesday's charter flight was the first for Zukow,
who usually took commercial flights to Maryland. He is survived by
his wife, Kathleen.
</P>
<P>
   - David Dahlen, 57, of Warminster, Pa., worked for Information
Spectrum Inc., a defense contractor based in Annandale, Va. He
spent 26 years as a career officer in the U.S. Navy before retiring
in 1989. Friends described him as an avid NASCAR fan.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Gail; a daughter, Debbi Kirsch, of
Lansdale, Pa., and his 2-year-old grandson, Andrew Kirsch.
</P>
<P>
   - Daniel Groff, 38, of Lacey Township, was a pilot with the
contract carrier, Patuxent Airways of California, Md. His uncle,
Jacob Groff of New Holland, Pa., said he began flying after
attending Shippensburg State University in Pennsylvania on a
football scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   He moved to Ocean County with his wife, Dana, and son about two
years ago. ''He struck me as a professional aviator, dedicated to
servicing his customers the best way possible,'' said Himes.
</P>
<P>
   - Joseph Mari, 37, of Toms River, also was a pilot for Patuxent
Airways. His sister, Sue Mari, said her brother had become a pilot
six years ago. He worked for Shadow Traffic in Philadelphia and
O'Brien Aviation in Lakewood before joining Patuxent Airways less
than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   - Craig Robinson, 28, of Hamilton Township, Mercer County, was a
flight instructor who also worked as a patrolman with the
Washington Township Police Department. He and his wife, Tara,
celebrated their fifth wedding anniversary last week. Their
5-month-old son, Alexander, was baptized on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   - Jason Wismer, 20, of Bensalem, Pa., was the student pilot
flying with Robinson. No other information was immediately
available.

<HEADLINE> 666 is winning combination in Thursday lottery  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW BRITAIN, Conn. (AP) - The winning number picked Thursday in
the Connecticut State Lottery's Mid-Day 3 drawing was a combination
many superstitious people would avoid: 666.
</P>
<P>
   The triple 6 combination, sometimes associated with Satan, won
players anywhere from $250 to $2,500. Lottery officials said they
won't know how many people picked the winning numbers until at
least Friday, when winners turn in their winning tickets at retail
lottery outlets.
</P>
<P>
   The 666 combination is one of 1,000 possible combinations in the
Mid-Day 3 game, drawn live on television at 1:57 p.m. Monday
through Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Players pick a combination of three numbers, from 000 to 999.
Wagers can range from 50 cents to $5, with payouts ranging between
$250 and $2,500, depending on the wager.
</P>
<P>
   The 666 combination is not very popular among players, said
Diane Patterson, a marketing coordinator for the lottery. She said
the combination has been drawn just eight times in the game's
23-year history.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson downplayed the Satanic association, saying many
players simply pick repeating digits.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're easy to remember,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> US Discourages Taiwan Meeting  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Wary of inflaming relations with China, the
State Department said Thursday it would not look favorably on a
proposal by members of Congress to meet with Taiwanese President
Chen Shui-bian when he stops in Los Angeles this weekend while en
route to the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman Richard Boucher said the administration sees Chen's
visit as an overnight layover only, and not a reason for official
activities.
</P>
<P>
   ''We would expect activities to be consistent with the purpose
of transiting and for the safety, comfort and convenience of the
traveler,'' Boucher said.
</P>
<P>
   Two California congressmen have requested private meetings with
Chen. One is Republican Dana Rohrabacher, a prominent congressional
China critic; the other is Democrat Howard Berman.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Rohrabacher, Ricardo Bernal, said the Clinton
administration has pressured Chen not to meet with the lawmakers
and that Chen has passed word that ''it would be difficult'' for
any such meeting to take place.
</P>
<P>
   Bernal said Rohrabacher was still exploring whether a meeting
could be arranged. Efforts to obtain comment from Berman's office
were unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   China objected to the U.S. decision to issue Chen a visa for the
layover and warned that it would severely damage U.S. ties with
China.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao expressed ''strong
resentment and firm opposition'' to the decision.
</P>
<P>
   China regards Taiwan as a renegade province and is
extraordinarily sensitive to any activity that would give Chen
increased international legitimacy.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan is a hot-button issue for the State Department as well.
U.S.-Chinese dialogue on Taiwan hit a low point in 1995 when the
administration granted a visa to then-President Lee Teng-hui to
visit Cornell University, his alma mater, despite giving Beijing
assurances that no visa would be issued.
</P>
<P>
   Boucher said Chen will be greeted as a courtesy by the chairman
of the nominally private organization that oversees unofficial
relations with Taiwan. The United States has no official relations
with Taiwan; it traded them in 1979 for relations with China.
</P>
<P>
   Boucher brushed aside questions about the lawmakers' proposed
meetings with Chen. Privately, a senior official said that the
administration is not in a position to tell a member of Congress
with whom he or she can meet.
</P>
<P>
   But in a letter sent Tuesday to Stanley Roth, the State
Department's top official for East Asia, Rohrabacher complained
that requests from members of Congress to meet privately with Chen
had been denied.
</P>
<P>
   ''In order for the United States to retain its role-model status
as the world's democratic leader, President Chen and his entourage
should be permitted to envoy the basic rights of freedom of speech
and assembly,'' Rohrabacher said.
</P>
<P>
   Boucher took issue with Rohrabacher's claim of a denial. ''There
is no procedure or request that we get that we approve or deny,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bernal, Rohrabacher's spokesman, said the administration has
been telling the Taiwanese that it would not be in their interest
for Chen to meet with members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The Taiwanese information office did not immediately return a
call seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Chen's two-week trip, beginning Sunday, includes Dominica,
Nicaragua, and Costa Rica, and the African countries of Gambia,
Burkina Faso and Chad. They are among the 29 countries with which
Taiwan maintains diplomatic relations.

<HEADLINE> Reno Plans FBI E-mail Probe  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department plans to hire a major
university to analyze the FBI's ''Carnivore'' e-mail surveillance
system, but civil libertarians said such a review can't answer all
the questions about the system.
</P>
<P>
   ''The university review team will have total access to any
information they need to conduct their review,'' Attorney General
Janet Reno told her weekly news conference Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The report will be made public, and a team of department
officials will ask privacy and law enforcement experts to comment
before making final recommendations to Reno about the system that
has caused an uproar among civil libertarians and in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would hope we could do it quickly,'' Reno said.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant Attorney General Steve Colgate, a career official who
will chair the department review committee, said Reno might be able
to choose a university in 10 days. The department panel will
analyze public comment on the university's recommendations and
forward a final report to Reno by Dec. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not a truly independent review,'' said Barry
Steinhardt, associate director of the American Civil Liberties
Union. ''The fox doesn't get to choose who guards the henhouse.''
</P>
<P>
   David L. Sobel, general counsel of the Electronic Privacy
Information Center, said he doubted such a review could satisfy
concerns that the system might be abused. ''The technical community
believes widespread testing is the only way to fully understand the
capabilities and vulnerabilities of a system,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sobel and Steinhardt said outsiders, like judges and Congress,
should decide whether Carnivore complies with the Constitution's
Fourth Amendment ban on unreasonable searches.
</P>
<P>
   Their groups have filed Freedom of Information lawsuits to
obtain records of the system, including its computer source code. A
judge gave the FBI until Wednesday to provide a timetable for
turning over documents.
</P>
<P>
   The Carnivore system has software that scans and captures
''packets,'' the standard unit of Internet traffic, as they travel
through an internet service provider's network. The FBI installs a
Carnivore unit at a provider's network station and configures it to
capture only e-mail to or from someone under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   FBI officials say court orders limit which e-mails they can see.
</P>
<P>
   But privacy advocates say only the FBI knows what Carnivore can
do, and Internet providers are not allowed access to the system.
They ask why the FBI retains remote control of Carnivore equipment
and doesn't just give it to Internet providers so they can comply
with court orders.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, FBI officials told Congress that Carnivore has been
used 25 times, including 10 national security and six domestic
criminal cases this year. None of the cases has gone to trial, so
the FBI has not disclosed details. Colgate said the system is still
in operation and criminal division attorneys monitor its use.
</P>
<P>
   ''It seems backward to still be using it, while arranging to
answer the questions about it,'' Sobel said.
</P>
<P>
   Describing the review, Colgate said Thursday, ''As much as
possible will be made public, and we will get as much input from
outside as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno and Colgate said the FBI, state and local law enforcers and
privacy and civil liberties groups will be consulted on the choice
of a university, the scope of its review and for reactions to any
recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   The university team will have complete access to all hardware
and software involved, including the computer source code for
Carnivore, Colgate said.
</P>
<P>
   The source code, however, is likely to be withheld from the
public because it is a trade secret of the company that produced
the software, which has been modified by the FBI, Colgate said.
</P>
<P>
   Steinhardt and Sobel said the source code should be released to
enable widespread examination of its capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   The department's chief science officer, Donald Prosnitz, a
physicist from the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, has
contacted three major universities and will probably contact six
more before recommending one to Reno, Colgate said.
</P>
<P>
   Among those Prosnitz will contact is the University of
California at San Diego, which Colgate said had preliminary talks
with the FBI before Reno expanded the review to include officials
outside the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Colgate's review panel will include Prosnitz; FBI Assistant
Director Donald Kerr, a nuclear physicist who heads the FBI
laboratory; Ed Dumont, the department's chief privacy officer; and
a criminal division representative.

<HEADLINE> 3 Missing in Navy Helicopter Crash  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CORPUS CHRISTI, Texas (AP) -- Three crew members were missing
Thursday afternoon after a Navy helicopter with six people on board
crashed and sank in the Gulf of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Two members of the crew were rescued from a raft. Both were
suffering from head injuries and were in stable condition at
Christus Spohn Memorial Hospital, said Lt. j.g. Chuck Bell with
Naval Air Station Corpus Christi.
</P>
<P>
   A third crew member was rescued later and taken to a hospital;
his condition was not immediately know, said Navy Storekeeper 2nd
Class Will Warner.
</P>
<P>
   The crew was aboard an MH-53E helicopter, also known as a Sea
Dragon, that crashed about 11 a.m. about 17 miles offshore. Bell
said the crew members reported mechanical problems before the craft
went down.
</P>
<P>
   The helicopter was from the HM-15 squadron, based at the naval
air station, and typically takes part in minesweeping operations.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the MH-53E, manufactured by Sikorsky Aircraft
Corporation of Stratford, Conn., can tow vessels, and transport
cargo and equipment. The helicopter can carry 55 passengers, or a
16-ton payload.

<HEADLINE> Camden man serving time for drug dealing indicted in 1993 murder  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) - A man who helped run what prosecutors called
this city's largest narcotics operation has been indicted on murder
charges related to a 1993 homicide.
</P>
<P>
   Luis ''Tun Tun'' Figueroa, 35, is accused of killing another
Camden man in the one-count indictment announced Thursday by Camden
County Prosecutor Lee A. Solomon.
</P>
<P>
   A medical examiner said Manuel ''Manolin'' DeJesus, 24, died
from two gunshot wounds to the head.
</P>
<P>
   The body was stuffed into the trunk of a 1982 Toyota which was
then set on fire on West Arlington Street in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Three co-defendants in the case have pleaded guilty to
conspiracy to murder, according to a statement from Solomon.
</P>
<P>
   Figueroa is now being held in the Fairton Correctional Facility
while he awaits a sentencing hearing in U.S. District Court.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 29, a federal jury found Figueroa guilty of drug
conspiracy. He faces up to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   During that trial several convicted drug dealers testified
against Figueroa and co-defendant Jose ''J.R.'' Rivera, detailing
how the organization distributed hundreds of kilograms of cocaine
in Camden through two open-air drug markets.
</P>
<P>
   One admitted drug dealer testified that in the mid-90s he was
involved in transporting as many as 685 kilos of cocaine with an
estimated street value of $65 million into Camden.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities have said the drug ring flourished because of its
high-ranking connections. Witnesses at the trial said law
enforcement officers shook down drug dealers for bribes and tipped
them off about upcoming raids.
</P>
<P>
   Testimony during the eight-week trial included allegations that
Camden Mayor Milton Milan bought kilo shipments of cocaine in 1993,
before he was elected. Milan faces federal corruption charges and
is also accused of laundering drug money.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said the organization used violence to control the
business.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera and Figueroa were among 15 people charged when
authorities broke up the drug ring. They were the only defendants
to stand trial. The others pleaded guilty and cooperated with
authorities.

<HEADLINE> Paciello's brother named in federal bank robbery indictment  </HEADLINE>
By TOM HAYS
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - The older brother of a Miami Beach nightclub
entrepreneur facing trial in a Brooklyn mob case has run afoul of
the feds himself.
</P>
<P>
   In an indictment unsealed Thursday in Brooklyn federal court,
George Paciello - brother of Chris Paciello - was identified as one
of 13 members of a loose-knit crew which robbed or burglarized more
than 30 banks in New York, Florida and elsewhere. One of his
co-defendants is a reputed soldier in the Bonanno organized crime
family.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say the crews' crime spree began in 1992 with an
armed holdup at a Staten Island bank - a $300,000 heist allegedly
masterminded by Chris Paciello and sanctioned by the Bonannos.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with crowbars, hammers, police scanners and
walkie-talkies, the crew scored $1.3 million over a seven-year
period by raiding night deposit boxes in the middle of the night in
Brooklyn, Staten Island, Long Island, Delaware, New Jersey and
Maryland, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999 - at the height of Chris Paciello's reign over the South
Beach club scene - his older brother and other bandits allegedly
broke into banks in Hollywood, Fl., making off with more than
$55,000 each time. George Paciello also was involved in a third
burglary at a Boca Raton bank, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   FBI agents arrested George Paciello, 31, on Thursday morning and
arraigned him in Miami federal court on bank burglary charges
carrying a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. He was released
on $300,000 bond.
</P>
<P>
   Paciello's attorney, Sam Burstyn, said his client ''fully
denies'' the charges. The older brother - a Boca Raton resident who
has worked for his brother in the nightclub business - and his wife
are expecting their first child, Burstyn said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We look forward to getting this put behind them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Paciello, 28, is charged with felony murder in a
racketeering indictment along with Anthony Spero, identified as the
former acting boss of the Bonanno crime family, and family
associates. The indictment alleges that as a member of the ''Bath
Avenue crew,'' he participated both in the 1992 bank robbery and a
botched push-in robbery that left a Staten Island housewife dead in
1993.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities also have accused Paciello of exporting mob money
and strong-arm tactics to South Beach, where he reinvented himself
as the owner of celebrity hangouts like Liquid, Bar Room and Joia.
</P>
<P>
   Paciello, whose real name is Christian Ludwigsen, has denied any
wrongdoing. He remains under house arrest on Staten Island,
awaiting trial in September.

<HEADLINE> FBI and State Police arrest four in plot to rob armored car  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MAYS LANDING, N.J. (AP) - Four Atlantic County residents were
ordered held without bail Thursday on charges they plotted to rob
an armored truck carrying cash destined for Atlantic City casinos.
</P>
<P>
   FBI agents and state troopers arrested the four at different
locations Wednesday night following a monthlong investigation
triggered when one of the suspects, Christine Baughman, contacted
an employee at Brinks Armored Services Inc., according to court
papers filed by the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Baughman, 28, of Egg Harbor Township, told the worker that she
and a friend wanted to rob a Brinks truck and asked if the worker
wanted to participate, the FBI said.
</P>
<P>
   The employee, who was not named, contacted the FBI and secretly
taped several conversations over the next weeks, according to the
filing.
</P>
<P>
   The conversations included a July 18 meeting with Steve Nieves,
34, of Egg Harbor Township, who said he wanted the informant to be
on the truck the day of the robbery, planned for this past
Wednesday, Aug. 9, at a rest stop on the Atlantic City Expressway,
the filing said.
</P>
<P>
   Nieves had once worked for another armored car company, FBI
Special Agent Sandra J. Carroll said.
</P>
<P>
   The informant met July 23 with Baughman, who said she and Nieves
hoped ''to obtain enough money - at least $1 million each - so that
they would not have to work any longer,'' the filing said.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll declined to say how much money is carried by the truck,
which she said travels between Brinks vaults in Pennsylvania and
Mays Landing, Atlantic County.
</P>
<P>
   She also said that they had found a place in northern New Jersey
where they would stash the money until it was divided.
</P>
<P>
   The filing said that this past Sunday, Nieves gave this game
plan to the informant:
</P>
<P>
   Nieves would arrive at the rest stop about 8 p.m. Wednesday in a
red vehicle and page the informant about 8:45 p.m., giving the code
''111'' to mean he and the others were ready.
</P>
<P>
   Nieves also said he would have a .357-caliber handgun with him
and would force the informant and another Brinks worker into the
back of the truck. They would drive it to a remote location, where
another person would be waiting with Nieves's blue pickup truck.
</P>
<P>
   Nieves drove the informant to that location. The informant gave
him three blue shirts and hats similar to those worn by Brinks
workers, which had been requested by Nieves, the filing said.
</P>
<P>
   An FBI surveillance team saw Nieves meet with Rafael Ocasio and
Radames Rodriguez about 7 p.m. Sunday at a restaurant in Egg Harbor
Township.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, 39, of Pleasantville, and Nieves left in a red
Mustang; Ocasio, 35, of Atlantic City, in the blue pickup.
</P>
<P>
   Nieves and Rodriguez were arrested at the Farley rest stop in
Mullica Township. A .44-caliber revolver loaded with hollow-point
bullets was under Nieves's seat, the FBI said.
</P>
<P>
   Ocasio was arrested in the pickup at the parking lot of Best
Buys in Mays Landing, while Baughman was arrested at her home.

<HEADLINE> Soccer Coach Says He's Lucky  </HEADLINE>
By JOSEPH WHITE
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) -- Jim Gabarra figures he got the plum
assignment.
</P>
<P>
   The first coach to be hired in the new women's professional
soccer league, he'll be coaching Mia Hamm in a city where women's
sports do well.
</P>
<P>
   Gabarra was introduced Thursday as the coach of the Washington
franchise of the WUSA, an eight-team league that begins play in
April.
</P>
<P>
   ''I consider myself lucky,'' Gabarra said. ''We've made our home
here, and anything that came up in this area I was certainly
interested in pursuing. To achieve it is certainly great luck.''
</P>
<P>
   Gabarra's background, like that of many American soccer players
and coaches, runs the gamut. He played for the U.S. Olympic team in
1988 and has played indoor and outdoor soccer professionally for an
alphabet soup of leagues: ASL, AISA, MISL, CISL and NPSL.
</P>
<P>
   Gabarra coached the Washington Warthogs in an indoor league from
1994-98 and also coached the international all-star team in the
U.S. women's indoor tour last fall. Lately he has been serving as a
volunteer assistant with his wife, 1996 U.S. soccer Olympian Carin
Jennings-Gabarra, who coaches the Navy women's team.
</P>
<P>
   Hamm, who went to high school in the Washington area, is one of
three national team players assigned to Gabarra's team. Michelle
French and goalkeeper Siri Mullinix are the others.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've seen the lows, when there wasn't a league and you had to
play indoors,'' Gabarra said. ''It's very fulfilling now to coach
in what will be the top league in the world for women. It would be
like popping up in England and being able to coach a Premier League
team.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials say the Washington team, will get a nickname after the
Olympics, will probably play its games at RFK Stadium.

<HEADLINE> Russian Hockey Players Denied Visas  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- USA Hockey has stepped in to help a coach and
three players on Russia's national junior hockey team obtain visas
to compete in a tournament in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Russian Ice Hockey Federation has come to us asking us to
help out and, basically, what we've done is we faxed out this
morning an official invitation to participate in the tournament,''
said Chuck Menke, director of media and public relations for USA
hockey, the country's governing body for the sport.
</P>
<P>
   Menke, contacted Thursday at USA Hockey's headquarters in
Colorado Springs, Colo., said the invitation was sent to the U.S.
embassy in Moscow. He said he didn't know why the U.S. government
has denied visas for the four to attend the tournament, Hockey
Night in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The tournament, featuring some of the world's top high school
age players, runs July 27 through Aug. 20 for boys, and Aug. 13 to
Aug. 20 for girls. The games are played at Merrimack College in
North Andover, Mass., and the Ice Center in Salem, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Sergei Gersonsky and players Mikhail Telnov, Anton Babchuk
and Nikolai Zherdev were summoned to the U.S. Embassy's consular
department Thursday, two days before they were to have left for the
tournament, said Sergei Samoilov, secretary-general of the Russian
Ice Hockey Federation, which is based in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Consular officials found that the four did not give sufficient
evidence that they were part of the team, Samoilov said.
</P>
<P>
   All team members have been approved by the Russian federation,
he added.
</P>
<P>
   ''We fail to comprehend what we face here -- incompetence or an
attempt to ruin the relations between two federations,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many Russian applicants for U.S. visas say there's often nothing
they can do to prove they won't overstay their welcome. But
American officials insist the approval process is fair and say that
three-fourths of applications are accepted.
</P>
<P>
   Menke said he hoped the official invitation ''will explain why
it's important for them to be here.''

<HEADLINE> Wildlife Sanctions Urged Vs Japan  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The World Wildlife Fund urged the Clinton
administration Thursday to immediately impose economic sanctions
against Japan after a report that a whale from an endangered
species had been killed.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no longer any reason for the United States to delay
action,'' said Richard N. Mott, the fund's vice president.
''President Clinton should impose sanctions immediately to avoid
further killing.''
</P>
<P>
   The fund said a Japanese fishing newspaper reported the first
killing of a Bryde's whale in more than 10 years at the start of
Japan's expanded hunt, which began in the northwest Pacific July
29.
</P>
<P>
   It said Japan's decision to expand the hunt to include sperm and
Bryde's whales ignored appeals from Clinton, British Prime Minister
Tony Blair, other world leaders and environment groups.
</P>
<P>
   Both kinds of whale are protected under U.S. endangered species
law. The Japanese already hunt minke whales which are considered
abundant enough to allow limited harvesting.
</P>
<P>
   Japan is a member of the International Whaling Commission, which
imposed a global moratorium on commercial whaling in 1986. But the
convention allows limited hunting of whales for scientific
research.
</P>
<P>
   The fund says Japan exploits this loophole to sell whale meat on
its domestic market, where it is a delicacy.
</P>
<P>
   Six Japanese whaling ships are hunting 160 minke as well as 50
Bryde's and 10 sperm whales. It is the first time Japan has hunted
Bryde's and sperm whales since 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Japan maintains that sperm and Bryde's whales are now populous
enough to be hunted commercially, but the wildlife fund and other
environment groups say there isn't enough information to justify
the Japanese claim.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeline Albright told the Japanese last week
the United States was deeply troubled by their decision to expand
the hunt. She said the United States would not hesitate to impose
penalties.
</P>
<P>
   The fund said if the Clinton administration wavers, it would
send a powerful signal to other nations interested in renewing
commercial whaling.

<HEADLINE> Cop's remark more apt to discourage than recruit to NYPD  </HEADLINE>
By DONNA DE LA CRUZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - One of the ads in the NYPD's second recruiting
campaign aimed at minority residents features actor Ray Romano
discussing how much he admires his brother the cop. But Sgt.
Richard Romano's remarks after Thursday's news conference were more
apt to discourage recruits than welcome them.
</P>
<P>
   ''Monetarily, it doesn't really pay now with the incentive you
get to retire,'' said Sgt. Romano, who is retiring next month.
''I've done 20 years on the streets and every man has his point
where he says it's his breaking point.''
</P>
<P>
   Police officials tried to downplay Sgt. Romano's comment, saying
he was ''not trained'' to talk to the media. And the sergeant later
clarified his remark to say that after 20 years on the job, he felt
it was time to move on.
</P>
<P>
   ''I really love this job,'' added Sgt. Romano, assigned to the
Manhattan Gang Unit.
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. Romano's remarks did not surprise Patrick Lynch, president
of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, the union representing
more than 26,000 officers. The PBA is in the midst of contract
negotiations with the city in hopes of obtaining raises and better
benefits. Lynch said city officers are close to the ''bottom of the
list'' nationwide when it comes to salaries.
</P>
<P>
   ''He spoke honestly and truthfully,'' Lynch said. ''He spoke
what all cops think. Police officers are moving on for greener
pastures. We need to make it worth staying on this job.''
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. Romano's remarks referring to finances and stress reflect
several of the reasons why the department is seeing a decrease in
the number of recruits. Last year, 15,200 people signed up to take
the police exam, the first step in joining the force. The number
was up from 14,202 in 1998, but previous tests were taken by more
than 20,000 applicants. In 1996, the number hit 31,986.
</P>
<P>
   With the booming economy, people are not attracted to a job with
a starting pay of $31,000, growing to $60,000 after five years.
Also, the stress of the job, low morale and frustration is evident
in the exodus of cops retiring from the force.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, 888 officers retired when they reached 20 years of
service, compared with 617 in 1998. Upon retiring at 20 years, an
officer gets half of his yearly salary, but ''none of the
aggravation,'' Lynch said.
</P>
<P>
   The PBA has launched its own ad campaign, with Lynch saying:
''Most people wouldn't take this job for a million bucks. A New
York City police officer does it for a helluva lot less.''
</P>
<P>
   The ads can be heard on the radio but several TV stations have
rejected the PBA ad depicting a bleeding officer lying on the
ground as too graphic.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Police Commissioner Howard Safir said he is
confident the recruiting campaign will work.
</P>
<P>
   ''Recruiting candidates, not just for the NYPD, but for all
government agencies, has become more difficult because of the
economy, and although I'm confident we will have enough recruits
for our next class, we want to make sure we get the best and the
brightest in the city,'' he said at the news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's recruitment campaign - the city's largest and
costliest at $10 million - was announced shortly after the fatal
shooting of Amadou Diallo by four white police officers, when
minority residents complained the force was too white.
</P>

   According to NYPD statistics, the force is 66 percent white,
18.5 percent Hispanic, 13.7 percent black, 1.7 percent Asian, and
0.1 percent American Indian or other ethnicity. The city's

   This year, the department is spending another $10 million on the
second campaign to pay for TV, radio, newspaper and billboard ads,
along with production costs. The ads will be printed in Chinese,
English, French, Korean, Russian and Spanish. Last year's ads were
in English and Spanish only.
</P>
<P>
   This year's campaign theme is ''Mission: Possible. Together we
can make a difference.'' The ads - nine in all - represent the
stories of different police officers told by people who know them
personally, said Terry Gallo, president of Robert A. Becker's
consumer division, which created the ads.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Romano, who stars in the TV show ''Everybody Loves
Raymond,'' wrote the text that appears in his ad.
</P>
<P>
   ''Like most brothers growing up, Rich and I were rivals,'' the
ad reads. ''But as much as the kid brother in me believes I can do
anything he can, the truth is, he has a courage I'll never have.
His daily dedication to helping people amazes me. Sure, I may get
the attention, but he's the one who deserves it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray Romano said he did the ad in honor of his brother and his
service to the city.
</P>
<P>
   ''He puts his life on the line and I tell jokes about diapers,''
he said.

<HEADLINE> N.Korea Terrorism Talks Productive  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP)-- Two days of U.S.-North Korean talks on
terrorism issues were productive and more are planned, the State
Department said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman Richard Boucher said the talks in Pyongyang, much like
a previous round in New York, focused on what North Korea must do
to remove itself from the list of countries the U.S. alleges
sponsor terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Leading the delegations were Michael Sheehan, an assistant
secretary of state, and Kim Gye Gwan, a vice foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
   Removal from the terrorism list would make the North Koreans
eligible for certain economic benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Pyongyang was put on the list because of its alleged involvement
in the midair bombing of a South Korean airliner near Myanmar in
1987.

<HEADLINE> Brother of murder suspect indicted on evidence tampering charges  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SOMERVILLE, N.J. (AP) - A Winslow man helped dispose of the body
of a woman by dumping her into Raritan Bay after she was killed by
his brother five years ago, a grand jury alleged Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   James Korman, 48, was charged with tampering with evidence,
concealing and removing the body of Paula Strazdas, whose body
surfaced in the river on Sept. 5, 1995. She had been shot twice in
the head.
</P>
<P>
   Korman's brother, John Korman, admitted last November to killing
34-year-old Strazdas in August 1995. He also admitted to killing
21-year-old Nancy Nott of Plainfield three years later with a
baseball bat, then burying her body in his back yard.
</P>
<P>
   John Korman came to his brother's Hillsborough home in the
summer of 1995 with Strazdas' body, the indictment said. The
brothers drove to James Korman's boat in Atlantic Highlands,
weighed Strazdas' body down with cinderblocks and dumped it in the
bay, the indictment said.
</P>
<P>
   James Korman's home telephone number is unlisted and he could
not be reached for comment Thursday.

<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Tony Batista hit his 34th homer, leaving
him tied for the American League lead, and had a go-ahead single
Thursday as the Toronto Blue Jays rallied past the Kansas City City
Royals 15-7.
</P>
<P>
   David Wells, 17-4 this season but 2-2 since the All-Star break,
failed to hold a 3-0 lead. He allowed seven runs and seven hits in
3 2-3 innings, his shortest outing since April 14 against Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Carpenter (8-10) won in relief for the first time this
season, giving up two hits in 4 1-3 scoreless innings. Overall, it
was his first victory since July 6.
</P>
<P>
   Brad Fullmer hit a three-run homer for the Blue Jays, who outhit
Kansas City 17-14 and won for just the fifth time in their last 11
games. Shannon Stewart was 3-for-6 with a homer and three RBIs, and
Alex Gonzalez was 3-for-6 with two RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City's Johnny Damon went 3-for-4 and is 61-for-124 (.492)
since the All-Star break, raising his average from .267 to .329. It
was his 18th multihit game since the break.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Fussell (4-3), who relieved with a the score 7-7 in the
fourth, gave up three runs and two hits in two innings.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Meadows, making his first start since the Royals acquired
him from San Diego on July 31, was tagged for seven runs and eight
hits in 3 2-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto trailed 6-3 in the fourth before going ahead on
Batista's homer, which tied him with Chicago's Frank Thomas,
consecutive doubles by Jose Cruz Jr. and Craig Grebeck, and
Stewart's two-run homer, which chased Wells.
</P>
<P>
   Jermaine Dye's RBI double tied it in the bottom half, but Dave
Martinez walked against Fussell leading off the fifth, advanced on
Carlos Delgado's groundout and scored on Batista's two-out single.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto made it 13-7 in the sixth on Gonzalez's RBI double off
Fussell, run-scoring singles by Martinez and Delgado off Tim Byrdak
and Fullmer's 24th homer, his 10th since the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart and Gonzalez added RBI singles off Jerry Spradlin in the
seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto took its first-inning lead on Martinez's RBI single and
Delgado's two-run double. But Kansas City took a 4-3 lead in the
bottom half on Dye's RBI double, Joe Randa's run-scoring single and
Mark Quinn's two-run homer.
</P>
<P>
   Randa hit and RBI double in the third and scored on Hector
Ortiz's infield single.
</P>
<P>
Notes  Wells remained 10-1 on the road. ... Stewart's had three
homers in the series. ... Royals 1B Mike Sweeney made a diving stop
Fullmer's grounder down the line and threw to Meadows on a close
play at first for the out. ... Quinn leads AL rookies with 23
homers. ... Royals manager Tony Muser had an extended argument with
plate umpire Mike Everitt in the fourth when Carlos Febles was
called out after his bunt hit him. Wells began walking off the
field to escape the heat during the long discussion and got to the
third-base line before Muser gave up. ... Blue Jays manager Jim
Fregosi was ejected by Everitt in the sixth for arguing a called
third strike on Stewart.

<HEADLINE> PLO Said To Nix Aid on Refugees  </HEADLINE>
By IBRAHIM BARZAK
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
turned down an American plan to set up a $30 billion international
fund to resettle refugees, a top Palestinian official said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Salim Zanoun, chairman of the PLO Central Council, said the
offer came during last month's summit at the Camp David
presidential retreat outside Washington. He said it was part of
American pressure on Arafat to compromise on the refugee issue.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians are demanding that millions of refugees be
allowed to return to their former homes in what is now Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Rejecting the offer, Arafat ''told the Americans that the issue
of refugees is non-negotiable,'' Zanoun told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher
declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   Israel is willing to allow a few thousand Palestinian refugees
to be reunited with their families in Israel. The others would
settle in a Palestinian state or in countries where they now live.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians fled during the 1948 war that followed Israel's
creation. They were confined to refugee camps in Egypt, Jordan,
Syria and Lebanon, where many still live with their descendants.
Some of the camps came under Israeli control in 1967, when Israel
captured the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
   Zanoun also said that the Central Council, the PLO's ruling
body, will convene a week before the Sept. 13 deadline for a peace
treaty with Israel to set the date for declaring Palestinian
independence.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat has given conflicting signals on whether he will proclaim
statehood on Sept. 13, even without Israel's blessing, or delay
such a move if a peace agreement has not been reached by then.
</P>
<P>
   During a tour of Europe and the Arab world following the Mideast
summit at Camp David, Arafat did not win unanimous backing for a
unilateral statehood declaration, Zanoun said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some countries told him (Arafat) that they will support the
declaration on Sept. 13, such as Egypt and Saudi Arabia,'' Zanoun
told a news conference in Gaza City. ''Some countries asked him to
give more time to peace talks and resume negotiations before any
declaration.''
</P>
<P>
   Zanoun said the 129-member Central Council would convene in the
first week of September, but did not give an exact date. In its
previous session in early July, the council told the Palestinians
to prepare for statehood by Sept. 13, but the wording of the
decision was vague enough to allow for an extension.
</P>
<P>
   By the first week of September, it will be clearer whether a
peace treaty can be reached.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and the chief Palestinian
negotiator, Ahmed Qureia, said Wednesday that prospects for another
Mideast summit were dim. Qureia said the gaps remain wide on all
issues, including borders of the Palestinian state, the status of
Jerusalem and the fate of Palestinian refugees.

<HEADLINE> Tigers 14, Orioles 3  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- Bobby Higginson had three hits and four RBIs, and
knuckleballer Steve Sparks baffled Baltimore for 7 2-3 innings as
the Detroit Tigers routed the Orioles 14-3 Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Damion Easley hit a two-run homer and Juan Gonzalez was 3-for-5
with two RBIs for the Tigers, who gained a split of the four-game
series with only their second win in seven games against the
Orioles this season. Rich Becker scored four runs and reached base
five times.
</P>
<P>
   Delino DeShields hit a two-run homer for Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Higginson, just 4-for-23 in his previous six games, hit RBI
singles in the first and third innings and a two-run double in the
fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit, averaging 2.8 runs in its previous six games, had a
trio of four-run innings. The Tigers had 14 hits and were helped by
three errors.
</P>
<P>
   Sparks (2-2), pressed into the rotation when Hideo Nomo went on
the disabled list, won his second straight start, allowing two runs
and four hits with four strikeouts and a walk.
</P>
<P>
   Sidney Ponson (6-8) gave up six runs and seven hits in four
innings, losing for the fourth time in five decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Higginson's RBI single gave the Tigers a 1-0 lead in the first,
but DeShields' two-run homer put the Orioles ahead in the third.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers batted around in a four-run home half featuring RBI
singles from Higginson and Jose Macias, and Deivi Cruz's sacrifice
fly. Another run scored on shortstop Melvin Mora's throwing error.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez doubled off the center-field wall for a 6-2 lead in the
fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Higginson's two-run double highlighted Detroit's four-run fifth
off Jason Johnson. Becker had an RBI single and the other run
scored on third baseman Ryan Minor's fielding error.
</P>
<P>
   Easley hit a two-run homer and Gonzalez a run-scoring single in
a four-run seventh off B.J. Ryan. Chris Richard added a sacrifice
fly off Todd Jones in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Tigers' three, four-run outbursts in the third and
fifth innings matched their highest total runs in any previous game
of the homestand. ... Orioles pitchers have allowed four or more
runs in an inning 57 times. ... Mora made two errors in the past
two games, including two Thursday, but hit .467 (7-for-15) in the
series. ... Orioles LF Brady Anderson left after failing to make a
diving catch of Damion Easley's double in the seventh. ... Tigers
3B Dean Palmer missed his second straight game to be with his wife,
who delivered twin boys overnight in Detroit. ... The crowd of
40,093 was the second-largest at Comerica Park.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Arrives in Moscow for Talks  </HEADLINE>
By ANNA DOLGOV
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat said upon arrival
in Moscow on Thursday that he had high hopes for his talks with
Russian officials on the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat is traveling the world seeking support after the failure
last month of his Camp David summit with Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud Barak. The Palestinians have vowed to declare an independent
state next month, a move that could spark violence if an agreement
is not reached beforehand.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat told journalists at the airport in Moscow that
Palestinian relations with Russia are ''good and friendly'' and
said talks with Russian officials are especially important now that
the talks have broken down.
</P>
<P>
   Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Vasily Sredin said Thursday that
Russia hopes Arafat will reach agreement with Israel and abstain
from unilaterally declaring independence.
</P>
<P>
   Sredin said that Moscow ''has always recognized the right of the
Palestinian people to the formation of their own state.''
</P>
<P>
   But ''Russia is convinced that the realization of this right
should be achieved by means of negotiations,'' he was quoted as
saying by the ITAR-Tass news agency.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat is expected to ask Russia to play a more active role in
the Mideast peace process. Russia is a co-sponsor of the process,
along with the United States, but has played a mostly low-profile
role.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat was to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin and
Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In Iran earlier Thursday, Arafat suffered a snub when the
government sent only a deputy foreign minister to greet him at the
airport. Iran is opposed to Arafat's peace deals with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat later asked Iran's President Mohammad Khatami for
political backing for the Palestinians' claim to Jerusalem,
state-run Tehran radio said.
</P>
<P>
   At Camp David, Barak offered the Palestinians limited control
over areas of east Jerusalem, but Arafat demanded full sovereignty
over that sector.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis, meanwhile, are also seeking to bolster
international support for their position. A top Israeli minister
visiting Turkey on Thursday urged negotiators to be practical in
their search for peace.
</P>
<P>
   ''Both of us need not to think that we represent the Messiah,''
said Shlomo Ben-Ami, who served as Israel's chief negotiator before
the Camp David talks.
</P>
<P>
   The top Palestinian envoy to Russia, Khairi Al-Oridi, said
Thursday he hoped that if Russia agrees to mediate more actively in
Mideast negotiations, the peace process would become more ''fair,''
ITAR-Tass said.
</P>
<P>
   Also Thursday, Putin and Barak spoke by telephone to discuss the
peace process. Putin assured Barak that Russia ''will continue to
do all it can to help achieve a compromise between the sides,'' the
Kremlin said in a statement.

<HEADLINE> Italy Frees Chileean Slay Suspect  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME (AP) -- Italy's Justice Ministry on Thursday freed a Chilean
leftist arrested in the 1983 slaying of a former leader of Chile's
military government.
</P>
<P>
   Italy also ruled out extraditing the man for what it said was a
political crime.
</P>
<P>
   Jaime Yovanovic Prieto had been held since Sunday in the central
town of Assisi at the request of the international police agency
Interpol. Prieto was wanted in Chile in the slaying of Gen. Carol
Urzua, who died in an ambush by leftist guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   Responsibility for the killing was claimed by the Revolutionary
Leftist Movement, which fought Gen. Augusto Pinochet's 1973-90
military dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   The Italian Justice Ministry said Prieto's alleged crime was of
a ''political nature,'' and that Italy's constitution bars
extradition in such cases. Italy also refuses to hand over suspects
when they might face the death penalty, as is the case in Chile.
</P>
<P>
   About 50 leftist activists staged a sit-in outside the prison
where Prieto was held until his release late in the day.
</P>
<P>
   Prieto, who lectures at a university in Sao Paulo, Brazil, was
in Assisi for a meeting. He has not asked for political asylum,
according to the Italian Justice Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   During Pinochet's regime, more than 3,100 people were killed by
secret police for political reasons, according to a Chilean
government report. The figure includes more than 1,000 people who
disappeared. On Tuesday, Pinochet was stripped of parliamentary
immunity by a Chilean court, opening the way for his trial.

<HEADLINE> Quann Sets Breaststroke Record  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL NEWBERRY
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Talk about an impatient teen.
</P>
<P>
   Megan Quann breaks her own American record, but that's not
enough for the 16-year-old. She wants to take on the world.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not satisfied,'' Quann said Thursday, even though she had
just set a national record at the U.S. Olympic trials in the
100-meter breaststroke. ''I want to break the world record and I
know I can do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Quann finished her preliminary swim in 1 minute, 7.12 seconds --
fastest in the world this year and eclipsing her mark of 1:07.54
set in March. She was 0.60 seconds off the world record held by
South Africa's Penny Heyns -- a significant difference to make up as
she headed into the evening semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   Was Quann worried about the gap? Hardly.
</P>
<P>
   ''Because the world record is such a low time, people think it's
untouchable,'' she said. ''I don't feel that way. I have a goal, to
break that record, and I believe I can get it.''
</P>
<P>
   Her strategy is simple.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every time I get up on the blocks, I want to swim as fast as I
can,'' said Quann, who has a 3.8 grade-point average at Rogers High
School in Puyallup, Wash. ''If you're racing, and especially at a
big meet like this, why would you want to swim anything but your
fastest?''
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe she could learn a thing or two from Lenny
Krayzelburg, world record-holder in the men's 100 backstroke. The
24-year-old native of the Ukraine cruised through the prelims at
54.33, fastest in the world this year.
</P>
<P>
   But he was just getting warmed up. Krayzelburg wore a
traditional suit -- forgoing the high-tech bodysuit -- and didn't
even bother with a skin cap. Heck, he probably could have reached
the semifinals swimming in a suit and tie.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can come in and work on some things and build my race,'' he
said. ''I'm saving it for (the final) tomorrow night.''
</P>
<P>
   Two of the most anticipated races of the eight-day trials were
on Thursday night's schedule.
</P>
<P>
   In the women's 100 butterfly, 33-year-old Dara Torres was
matched against former training partner Jenny Thompson. In the
men's 400 individual medley, Tom Wilkens challenged the dominance
of Tom Dolan, world record-holder and defending Olympic champion.
</P>
<P>
   Torres, who made her Olympic debut in 1984, is trying to become
the first American to swim in four Games. She has been remarkably
strong since ending a seven-year retirement, breaking the U.S.
record in the 100 fly in Wednesday's preliminaries.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, 27, was the inspiration for Torres' comeback in July
1999, and the two initially trained together at Stanford. By
December, their coach split them up because workouts were starting
to resemble a mini-Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson is a five-time gold medalist, but all have come on
relay teams. She was a major disappointment at the 1996 trials,
failing to qualify in any of her individual events.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkens, of Palo Alto, Calif., was on world-record pace through
300 meters in the morning prelims but dropped back on the freestyle
leg to 4:16.91, missing Dolan's mark by more than four seconds. His
rival was second-fastest at 4:18.89.
</P>
<P>
   The top two in each event will make the Olympic team.
</P>
<P>
   Brooke Bennett, the 1996 gold medalist in the 800 freestyle,
took it easy in the prelims of the 400 free and still finished at
4:08.87 -- more than two seconds ahead of the next-fastest
qualifier, Diana Munz.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was the easiest 4:08 I ever swam in my life,'' said
Bennett, sounding confident heading into the evening final.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett still has unfinished business from the 1996 trials, when
she failed to qualify in the 400 -- her best event. She wants to
make up for it in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm using all my experience from '96,'' Bennett said. ''I can
really feel the wisdom I've learned over four years.''
</P>
<P>
   Courtney Shealy of Columbia, S.C., was fastest qualifier in the
women's 100 backstroke and Josh Davis of Austin, Texas, led the 200
freestyle qualifying.

<HEADLINE> Poll finds Bush lead narrowed since Lieberman announcement  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   STORRS, Conn. (AP) - A new national poll taken since Connecticut
Sen. Joseph Lieberman was selected as Al Gore's running mate finds
Republican George W. Bush running slightly ahead of the Democratic
ticket.
</P>
<P>
   The telephone poll of 502 voters, conducted Monday through
Wednesday by the Center for Survey Research and Analysis at the
University of Connecticut, found Bush and running mate Dick Cheney
favored by 43 percent of people surveyed.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Lieberman drew support from 38 percent of respondents,
while Green Party candidate Ralph Nader, a resident of Winsted,
Conn., was backed by 4 percent. Less than 1 percent supported
possible Reform Party candidate Pat Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage
points.
</P>
<P>
   Polls taken after the GOP convention but before Gore picked
Lieberman had shown Bush with a double-digit lead.
</P>
<P>
   The poll found that while Lieberman is well-known in
Connecticut, more than half of voters surveyed nationally said they
did not know enough about him to form an opinion. Forty percent
said they had a favorable opinion of the 58-year-old senator while
6 percent had a negative view.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-five percent of Democrats said the selection of Lieberman
made them more likely to vote for the Democratic ticket; an equal
number of Republicans said the selection of Cheney - who served as
defense secretary under former President Bush - made them more
likely to back the GOP ticket.
</P>
<P>
   But more than a quarter of Republicans surveyed said Cheney's
selection made them less likely to support Bush, while 16 percent
of Democrats said they were less likely to back Gore because of
Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman was an early critic of President Clinton's behavior in
the Monica Lewinsky scandal, although he later opposed impeachment.
After being told that Lieberman had been an ''outspoken critic'' of
the president's actions, 55 percent of respondents said that made
them much more or somewhat more likely to vote for him.
</P>
<P>
   ''With Lieberman on the Democratic ticket, it makes it easier
for Al Gore to distance himself from any negative baggage left over
from the impeachment,'' said Sam Best, co-director of the poll.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Lieberman confirmed Thursday that Lieberman
planned to continue his re-election campaign for the Senate as well
as run for vice president. More than half - 54 percent - of the
people surveyed said they felt Lieberman should bow out of the
Senate race.

<HEADLINE> More mosquitoes, birds found with West Nile virus  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - Two dead crows and three samples of trapped
mosquitoes have tested positive for West Nile Virus in the city,
but no additional people have been infected, health officials
announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   A Staten Island man was infected with the deadly virus earlier
this month but made a full recovery.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, 33 birds and 11 mosquito samples have found to
be carrying the West Nile virus in the city. The virus has also
been found in birds and mosquitoes in the city's suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent samples of infected mosquitoes were found in
northern Manhattan, the Glen Oaks section of Queens and the
Tottenville area of Staten Island in late July. One of the crows
was found in northern Manhattan, the other in Staten Island.
</P>
<P>
   The areas where the birds and mosquitoes were found have since
been sprayed with pesticide, said city health commissioner Neal
Cohen.

<HEADLINE> Driver killed, pedestrian critical in bizarre incident  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - An aspiring hip-hop mogul, dying from two
gunshot wounds suffered outside a lower Manhattan club, made a
fruitless flight for safety early Thursday that ended when his car
slammed into a pedestrian two blocks away.
</P>
<P>
   Ivory Davis, 27, was mortally wounded while sitting inside his
parked Range Rover just after 4 a.m. outside 315 Hudson St. in
Soho, said police Chief of Detectives William Allee.
</P>
<P>
   In a bizarre twist, police said Davis had survived a previous
shooting outside another Manhattan night club just six months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Davis was parked near the popular nightspot Club NV, Allee said.
At least one gunman walked up to the driver's side of his vehicle
and fired four shots, hitting Davis twice.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, attempting to flee his killer, swung onto Spring Street
and headed west. After careening wildly for two blocks, the vehicle
jumped the curb, smashed into a restaurant front and struck a man
walking on Sixth Avenue, Allee said.
</P>
<P>
   Johan Camitz, 38, a visitor from Sweden, was critically injured
in the accident. According to police, Camitz was a director who
last year won an ANDY Award for his work on a Volkswagen
commercial. The awards honor creativity in commercials worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Camitz died later Thursday at St. Vincent's Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, whose vehicle also struck a light pole as well as tables
and planters at the restaurant, was declared dead at the scene. He
was the co-owner of Yo-Yo Records, a Weehawken, N.J.-based hip-hop
label.
</P>
<P>
   The Brooklyn native was wounded in a Feb. 23 shooting outside
another Manhattan club, the Tunnel, Allee said. No arrests were
ever made in that shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Davis had been in and out of jail since 1993, and was awaiting
sentencing on a Brooklyn assault conviction when he was killed. He
had a half-dozen previous arrests on a variety of charges.
</P>
<P>
   Police were interviewing witnesses and clubgoers to determine if
Davis was actually inside the club before the shooting. There were
no arrests in the Thursday morning shooting, police said.

	   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) - A Fort Campbell, Ky., soldier from
Castleton, N.Y., died Thursday, four days after an apparent fight
outside a Nashville nightclub.
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. Shane A. McCulloch, 22, was declared dead at Vanderbilt

<HEADLINE> Soldier Suspended for Nazi Web Site  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- A German army sergeant suspected of registering a
''Heil Hitler'' Web address last week has been suspended from duty,
the Defense Ministry said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Media reports that the soldier, 28, had applied for the site
address prompted prosecutors in the eastern city of Schwerin to
examine whether he should be charged under laws banning neo-Nazi
activity. Authorities have not identified the suspect.
</P>
<P>
   The Web address www.heil-hitler.de has been removed by the
German-based Internet service provider. The Defense Ministry said
the soldier has been barred from wearing a uniform pending the
outcome of investigations.
</P>
<P>
   News of the Web site case comes at a time of growing concern in
Germany about neo-Nazi propaganda on the Internet and a wave of
attacks on foreigners and other minorities, in which at least three
people have died this year.

<HEADLINE> Cowboys' Lett Primed for Season  </HEADLINE>
By JAIME ARON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas (AP) -- In his last two full seasons, Leon
Lett has been a Pro Bowl defensive tackle for the Dallas Cowboys.
Problem is, those seasons were 1994 and '98.
</P>
<P>
   Drug-related suspensions have done a better job of stopping Lett
than offensive linemen. Three punishments have cost him 28 games in
the '95, '96, '97 and '99 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Lett goes into this season knowing he has a lot to prove.
</P>
<P>
   The main thing is remaining drug-free. A close second, though,
is showing that he still has the quick first step that earned him
the nickname ''Big Cat'' and the ferociousness to terrorize
backfields.
</P>
<P>
   ''I tell Leon all the time, 'This is your year. You're going to
make it through everything,''' coach Dave Campo said. ''And, to be
honest with you, I feel good about him right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Lett is coming off a mediocre season. He played the final eight
games and averaged just three tackles a game. Yet there were
flashes of his old self, such as the Philadelphia game when he tied
his career high with nine tackles.
</P>
<P>
   The optimism surrounding this season is based on Lett being in
better shape. He's 290 pounds, about 20 more than last season, and
most of the new bulk is muscle. He's upped his bench press to 500
pounds. He's also getting to go through training camp this season,
which he missed in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ''Leon has that explosive first step back,'' said defensive
tackles coach Andre Patterson. ''He makes a big play every day in
practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Lett is in a rotation behind starters Alonzo Spellman and Chad
Hennings. Patterson believes fewer snaps will make Lett more
effective.
</P>
<P>
   Lett, though, is hungry for more.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can't keep him out of drills,'' Patterson said. ''We wanted
to give him some practices off and he won't do it. He's enjoying
being out there, he's enjoying learning and he's getting better all
the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Lett doesn't give interviews, he appears happy. He
smiles often and jokes with teammates. He walked off the practice
field Thursday talking to a young fan and spent some time signing
autographs while still wearing his helmet and pads.
</P>
<P>
   That's the kind of person Patterson expected, even though he
barely knew Lett.
</P>
<P>
   Their paths first crossed at the 1998 Pro Bowl when Patterson
was an assistant. Lett impressed Patterson by staying late after
practice and showing an eagerness to learn when he could've run off
to enjoy a Hawaii vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson was a fan of Lett's long before then. He had even
built a collection of Lett highlights to use as a teaching tool
while at New England and Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very unique for a 6-7 guy to have that kind of quickness
and explosiveness,'' Patterson said. ''I wanted to show my tall
guys that a big guy can do that.''
</P>
<P>
   The question now is whether he can still do it. And for how
long.
</P>
<P>
   He'll be 32 midway through this season. If he gets suspended
again, it would cost him at least another full season.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's definitely still got Pro Bowl potential,'' Patterson
said. ''If he stays healthy and continues to progress the way he's
been doing, there's no question.''

<HEADLINE> 49ers Promote Donahue  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   STOCKTON, Calif. (AP) -- The San Francisco 49ers have promoted
player personnel director Terry Donahue to assistant general
manager, another step in paving the way for Bill Walsh's eventual
retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh, 68, indicated Wednesday that he could step down after
this season. Donahue has been considered Walsh's heir apparent
since joining the 49ers in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have another year on my contract following this one,'' Walsh
said at the 49ers training camp, ''but I wouldn't eliminate the
possibility of stepping away sooner.''
</P>
<P>
   Donahue, the former UCLA coach, will continue to be involved
with the draft process and expand his responsibilities in contract
negotiations, personnel decisions and administrative duties, Walsh
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''As time goes on,'' Donahue said, ''I'll start taking more of
those responsibilities on.''
</P>
<P>
   Donahue, 56, coached the Bruins from 1976-95, winning 98 Pac-10
games, the most in conference history. Before he joined the 49ers,
he was an analyst for CBS Sports.
</P>
<P>
   He said he's excited about the future.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to play. It's like being the backup quarterback. You
want to play,'' he said. ''For me to say, 'No, I'm going to be
patient forever,' that's not accurate. I want to play, but at the
same time I want to be respectful and appreciative of what Bill
Walsh and (vice president) John McVay have meant to this
organization. And I'm going to continue in that role.''
</P>
<P>
   Walsh said he expects the addition of Donahue, new 49ers
president Peter Harris and others in the front office will help
alleviate problems associated without he salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our problems, if there are any, are related to the salary
cap,'' Walsh said. ''But we see ourselves dealing with that
directly, and each year that passes we're less affected by it. We
expect to have just one more year of the salary cap issue. We've
addressed it.''

<HEADLINE> 15 World Cup Vets Make Olympics  </HEADLINE>
By JOSEPH WHITE
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) -- Despite a youth movement from a new coach,
the U.S. women's Olympic soccer team will look a lot like the team
that won the World Cup a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen of the 20 players from the World Cup squad, including
all of the regular starters, were chosen Thursday by coach April
Heinrichs to make up the 18-player roster that will represent the
United States next month at the Sydney Games.
</P>
<P>
   Heinrichs made the veterans nervous when she experimented with
younger lineups after she succeeded Tony DiCicco in January. It
quickly became apparent that five players from the World Cup team --
Tisha Venturini, Danielle Fotopoulos, Tiffany Roberts, Tracy Ducar
and Saskia Webber -- did not figure in Heinrichs' Olympic plans.
</P>
<P>
   But the mainstays are still there, from Mia Hamm to Brandi
Chastain to 34-year-old Michelle Akers, the oldest member of the
team. Akers, who had shoulder surgery in May and suffers from
chronic fatigue syndrome, has said this will be her last
international tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ''Actually I didn't think I was going to make it this year,''
said Akers, who wore a shoulder harness as she practiced with the
team Thursday. ''There were many times I thought 'There's too many
obstacles, too exhausting, too much pain.' Every time I hit the
wall something was there to help me over it and, one day at a time,
I made it.''
</P>
<P>
   Akers has played in 150 games for the U.S. national team,
appearing in three World Cups and the 1996 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Two other players recovering from injuries also made the cut.
Captain Carla Overbeck, who is also retiring from international
competition after the Olympics, had knee surgery in May, but it
held up well in Thursday's grueling practice. Goalkeeper Briana
Scurry was selected after a long battle with shin splints, but she
is now the backup to Siri Mullinix in the only major change to the
starting lineup from the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ''Having Michelle Akers and Carla Overbeck on this team was a
decision that I made in my mind two or three months ago because of
Carla's leadership,'' Heinrichs said.
</P>
<P>
   ''While Carla's knee might be at only 70 to 75 percent right
now, her will and power among these players, along with her
leadership, makes her the glue of this team. ... We all know that
Michelle one year ago helped this country win one of its most
impressive trophies ever. One year away from that she is still a
world class player, but she struggles with her shoulder. I think
what we will see over the next couple of weeks that she will get
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Heinrichs' eye on the future was reflected in three players who
weren't at the World Cup: Mullinix, 22, Nikki Serlenga, 22, and
Danielle Slaton, 20
</P>
<P>
   ''After the first week some players approached me and were a
little concerned about brining in these young players,'' Heinrichs
said. ''I told them if we had more than two-to-three younger
players, we've made too much of a change. I'm so proud of these
players who've hung in there, and clawed to hang around this team.
We weeded out the ones that aren't mentally ready yet, and we
weeded out the ones that aren't physically ready yet.''
</P>
<P>
   The team is training in Annapolis and will play there against
Russia in the first game of a three-game Olympic kickoff tour
Sunday.

<HEADLINE> At Naval air station, tearful employees remember victims  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN CURRAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKEHURST, N.J. (AP) - They cried and they reminisced. They
gathered in small groups to talk or went, individually, to seek out
crisis counselors.
</P>
<P>
   In the offices, cubicles and hangars of Lakehurst Naval Air
Engineering Station, disbelief turned to mourning Thursday among
the workers and friends of the six civilian employees killed in the
midair collision of two twin-engine planes in Burlington Township.
</P>
<P>
   ''The grief around the base is just tremendous,'' said Pattie
Odoardo, a co-worker of victim Cynthia Kovacs. ''It's very, very
quiet. People are still in a state of shock.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 2,200 people work here, but there were hardly any who
weren't touched in some way by the crash.
</P>
<P>
   ''It seems that everybody knew some on the plane, or somebody
affected by it,'' said Patrick Murphy, a base spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Flags flew at half-staff and the daily shuttle flights that
carried Lakehurst officials to the Patuxent River, Md.,
headquarters of the Naval Air Warfare Center were suspended in the
wake of Wednesday's crash, which killed 11 people.
</P>
<P>
   Such stoppages are routine after crashes, Murphy said. It wasn't
clear when they would resume.
</P>
<P>
   The flights were routine for Lakehurst employees working on the
design and development of steam catapults, aircraft carrier
arresting gear, air launch and recovery equipment and other
projects.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was on the plane Tuesday and I was supposed to go
(Friday),'' said Chris Neubert, 39, a systems safety engineer whose
cubicle was next to Kovacs'.
</P>
<P>
   ''Somebody set the meetings for the right day - for me,
anyway,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, the flights would go directly to Patuxent River, Md.
But Himes said the doomed plane made a stop at Mercer County
Airport just before the crash to pick up Kovacs, 39, and
57-year-old David Dahlen, who worked for a Virginia-based defense
contractor.
</P>
<P>
   The other Lakehurst employees killed were Angelo George, 39;
Robert Polo, 39; Michael Simodejka, 52, John Vail, 36; and
56-year-old John Zukow. Kovacs was a mechanical engineer who worked
on aircraft safety systems. Vail worked as a program manager. Polo
and Simodejka were logistics management specialists. George managed
engineering programs and Zukow was an engineering technician.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy base plans to hold a memorial for the victims next week
in the gymnasium, but the date and time will not be set until all
six are buried, according to commanding officer Capt. Stephen
Himes.
</P>
<P>
   About 20 crisis counselors fanned out across the sprawling Ocean
County air base and members of its Family Services Center were
available to tend to co-workers and friends feeling the grief.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can see it in people's faces. And a lot of people have
those faces on today,'' Himes said.
</P>
<P>
   Pamela Schott, a social worker from the base's Family Services
Center who was overseeing the grief counseling, said she saw
employees crying as she made her rounds Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''What I heard, resoundingly, was 'How can we help the
families?' even if they didn't know (the victims) personally,''
Schott said.
</P>
<P>
   The families of base workers were grieving, too, if only because
the tragedy hit so close to home.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I was leaving (for work) today, my wife said to me, 'Be
careful.' She never said that before,'' said George DeBiase, the
base's chief engineer.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, two- and three-person ''casualty assistance teams''
from the base were assigned to each of the families, to help them
retrieve their loved ones' personal effects, seek counseling and
begin to deal with administrative issues, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're focusing our attention on the families, helping them
through this time of grieving,'' Himes said.
</P>
<P>
   Aviation tragedies are nothing new at Lakehurst. The base is the
location of perhaps the most famous one of all - the Hindenburg.
</P>
<P>
   On May 6, 1937, the 804-foot airship exploded into flames above
the airfield after a 2&AMP;frac12;-day flight from Frankfurt, Germany, killing
35 passengers and one Navy crewmen on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   On July 26, 1973, two F-4 Phantoms practicing for an air show
collided at the base, killing three military aviators.

<HEADLINE> Grand jury charges police officers with extortion, drug possession  </HEADLINE>
By HADLEY PAWLAK
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - A federal grand jury indicted two
Schenectady police officers Thursday on charges they intended to
sell crack cocaine they forcibly took from a suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Patrolmen Michael Siler, 32, and Richard Barnett, 30, have each
been charged with one count of extorting drugs by the wrongful use
of force and one count of possessing crack with the intent to sell.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted of each county, they face up to 20 years in prison
and fines that could top $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   About 40 Schenectady police officers stood outside the federal
courthouse in Albany when the indictments were announced,
supporting their fellow officers and maintaining Siler and
Barnett's innocence.
</P>
<P>
   Accusations of brutality and corruption have plagued the
Schenectady police over the last year, breeding distrust of the
150-plus member department among residents in the city of 65,000.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's always difficult for a law enforcement officer to bring
charges against another officer,'' said Tom McClenaghan of the FBI.
''But it's sadder that an officer in uniform would take crack
cocaine from a suspect with the intent of selling it.''
</P>
<P>
   Siler denied any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   ''All I'm going to say is I fully expect to be cleared because
I've done nothing wrong,'' he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Barnett nor his lawyer would comment.
</P>
<P>
   The grand jury charged that on Aug. 3, 1999 Siler and Barnett,
while on duty, threw an individual against a car, told him not to
move and took a quantity of crack from his pocket. They did not
arrest the individual or turn the crack into evidence at the police
station, the indictment charges.
</P>
<P>
   David French, the U.S. Attorney for the northern district of New
York, said the investigation is ongoing and could result in more
charges.
</P>
<P>
   A black man has alleged Siler and Barnett picked him off a city
street last summer for no reason, forced him into a patrol car and
then punched him and threw his shoes into the bushes before
abandoning him on a dark rural road. He has sued the officers, the
city and the police department in federal court.
</P>
<P>
   Several allegations of witness tampering have been brought
against the Schenectady Police Department since the federal grand
jury investigation began, according to French. Those accusations
are being investigated and, if proven, could carry a ''serious
federal penalty.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Public corruption is one of the top priorities of the FBI,''
said McClenaghan. ''This is a sad day for law enforcement in the
capital region,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Koenig, Siler's lawyer, vehemently denied any charges of
witness tampering.

<HEADLINE> Pataki pledges $10 million down payment  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   YONKERS, N.Y. (AP) - Gov. George Pataki called Thursday for an
end to federal involvement in the Yonkers school system, urging all
parties to meet immediately to settle a desegregation case that has
lasted two decades.
</P>
<P>
   ''These are difficult issues to resolve that will require all
sides to show good faith and a willingness to compromise,'' Pataki
said at a news conference at the Museum Middle School. ''We can end
federal control of Yonkers schools and secure a better future for
our children if we all work together.''
</P>
<P>
   A call to the NAACP, which brought the desegregation case in
1980, was not immediately returned.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki said he was demonstrating his own good faith by pledging
up to $10 million immediately as a kind of down payment on whatever
amount the state is eventually billed to help remedy what the
courts have called ''vestiges of segregation'' in Yonkers schools.
The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in May that the state would have to
share costs of a desegregation plan that includes magnet schools,
voluntary busing, school closings and staff reassignments for the
city's 24,000-student school district.
</P>
<P>
   The schools' troubles have continued this year with Mayor John
Spencer firing Andre Hornsby, the city's first black schools
superintendent, whose tenure saw higher test scores and smaller
gaps between white and minority students. They clashed over federal
control, with Hornsby fearing that if federal oversight ended, the
schools would lose court-mandated funding.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge ruled in 1985 that Yonkers officials
intentionally and unlawfully promoted racial segregation through
their housing and school policies. He ordered the city to
desegregate the school system and build subsidized housing in
predominantly white sections of the city.

<HEADLINE> Nine subway clerks indicted in MetroCard scam  </HEADLINE>
By SAMUEL MAULL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Nine subway clerks have been charged with
stealing nearly $100,000 from the Transit Authority by using
discarded MetroCards to create new cards which they sold for their
personal benefit.
</P>
<P>
   The nine, who worked various shifts in different Manhattan
subway stations, stole amounts that ranged from $1,470 to $34,947
between Jan. 1 and Aug. 1, according to an indictment that was
unsealed Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. John Cassidy, who led the eight-month investigation of the
scam, said the clerks hired people to collect and crease the
valueless MetroCards which the clerks used to create new cards,
each with a single $1.50 fare.
</P>
<P>
   Cassidy said the investigation began after police arrested
several hustlers for selling rides by using bent cards that fool
the turnstile's fare recording mechanism into thinking there is a
fare on the card. Facing jail, they told on the clerks, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cassidy said the clerks took the collected and bent cards, and
made computer records show that the $1.50 had simply been
transferred from one card to another. The clerks sold those newly
created cards to the public and pocketed the money.
</P>
<P>
   The people the clerks hired to collect and bend abandoned cards
were paid half the value that the clerks gave to each card, or 75
cents.
</P>
<P>
   Cassidy said that when clerk Anthony Waller, 29, of Brooklyn,
was arrested three hours into his shift last week at the Fulton
Street station on the Lexington Avenue line, he had 100 old, bent
cards on him.
</P>
<P>
   The other eight defendants were arrested Wednesday at the TA's
Jay Street offices in Brooklyn. Six were charged with third-degree
grand larceny and face up to seven years in prison if convicted,
and two were charged with fourth-degree grand larceny, which is
punishable by to four years.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everything that happens with a MetroCard is recorded
somewhere,'' Cassidy said. This includes the recording of a clerk's
identification number every time he or she uses the computer to do
anything with a card.
</P>
<P>
   Cassidy said he asked transit officials to use their mainframe
computers to identify the clerks with the highest volume of traded
in cards, and that is how they identified the clerks who allegedly
were stealing.
</P>
<P>
   Of the eight defendants arrested Wednesday, two were released in
their own recognizance and the other six were held in bail amounts
that ranged from $1,000 to $2,500. They are due back in court on
Aug. 17.
</P>
<P>
   In March, subway clerk Vincent Capuccio, 29, of Lake Ronkonkoma,
was arrested in Queens on charges of stealing $327,000 in a similar
MetroCard scam. Queens District Attorney Richard Brown said
Cappucio once created more than $38,000 worth of MetroCards in a
single day.

By The Associated Press	   Excerpts from Clinton's remarks At Ministers'
Leadership
Conference in South Barrington, Ill.:
<TEXT>
<P>
   ''I think that, as awful as what I went through was and
humiliating as it was -- more to others than to me even, sometimes
when you think you've got something behind you and then it's not
behind you, this, sort of, purging process, if it doesn't destroy
you, can bring you to a different place.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm now in the second year of a process of trying to totally
rebuild my life from a terrible mistake I made. And I now see -- I
don't think anybody can say, ''Hey, the state of my spiritual life
is great. It's on -- it's constant and it's never going to change.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I had to come to terms with a lot of things about the
fundamental importance of character and integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been an amazing encounter, you know, trying to rebuild my
family life, which is the most important thing of all. And it took
a lot, a lot of effort that I've never talked about, and probably
never will, because I don't really think it's anybody else's
concern.''
</P>
<P>
   ''To rebuild the support of the people I work with, and then to
try to be worthy of the fact that two-thirds of the American people
stuck with me. You know, that's an incredible thing.''
</P>
<P>
   ''And so, I wake up everyday, no matter what anybody says or
what goes wrong or whatever, with this overwhelming sense of
gratitude, because it may be that if I hadn't been knocked down in
the way I was and forced to come to grips with what I've done, and
the consequences of it, in such an awful way, I might not never
ever had to really deal with it 100 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   ''You know, I -- because this kind of thing happens to -- not
maybe this kind of thing, but all kinds of problems come up
people's lives all the time, and usually they're not played out
with several billion dollars of publicity under neon lights before
people, but they still have to be dealt with. And in a funny way,
when you realize there's nothing left to hide, then you -- it, sort
of, frees you up to do what you ought to be doing anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know if that makes any sense. But to me, I feel this
overwhelming sense of gratitude.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I also learned a lot about forgiveness. I've always thought I
was, sort of, a forgiving, generous person, you know,
non-judgmental in a negative sense, not that I don't have
opinions.''
</P>
<P>
   ''But I realized once you've actually had to stand up and ask
for forgiveness before the whole wide world, it makes it a little
harder to be as hard as I think I once was on other people. And
that has meant something to me, too. I think I've learned something
about that.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I just -- you know, to me, I had to come -- there were a lot of
things going on at the time, as you remember, that were unrelated,
I think, to the fact that I did something wrong that I needed to
acknowledge and apologize for and then begin a process of atonement
for. And there were a few days when I basically was thinking more
about what my adversaries were trying to do than what I should be
trying to do.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I think I gave a clear, unambiguous, brutally frank and
frankly personally painful statement to me, because I had to do it.
I mean, I finally realized that I was -- you know, that I'd never be
all right unless I stood up there and said what I did, and said it
was wrong, and apologized for it.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that anyone who saw that, and who observed what
happened afterward, would not doubt that there had been a full and
adequate apology.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I think one of the things you learn is that even a president --
all you can do is be responsible for what you do, you know? And
what other people say about it or whether it gets out there, you
have to work hard to get it out there.''
</P>
<P>
   ''But I suppose there was a time when I was upset about it. But
then I realized that that was another form of defensiveness; that
if I really thought about that, that was just another excuse not to
be doing what I should be doing, which is to work on my life, work
on my marriage, work on my parenthood, work on my work with the
White House and the administration, and work on serving the
American people.''
</P>
<P>
   ''You know, believe it or not, I hadn't thought about it in a
long, long time now. I thought about it a little bit now because
you asked me to do this and I said yes, and here we are in the soup
together.''
</P>
<P>
   ''But I don't think about it now, because I realize that any
time you're supposed to be doing something with your life and you
get off thinking about what somebody else is saying or doing about
it or to you or whatever, it's just a crutch for not dealing with
what you're supposed to be dealing with. So I finally just let it
go.''
</P>
<P>
   ''And I hope people can see that it's different. You know, you
just have to hope that and go on.''

<HEADLINE> Russia: U.S. Doc Can't See American  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Russia on Thursday refused a request to have a
U.S. Embassy physician in Moscow visit an imprisoned Pennsylvania
businessman, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have raised this issue repeatedly with senior Russian
officials,'' Boucher said. ''We have made clear they bear the
responsibility for protecting the welfare of American citizens
detained in Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   The businessman, Edmund Pope, who has bone cancer that is in
remission, was arrested four months ago on charges of stealing
military secrets. He was gathering information on a commercially
advertised torpedo. No trial date has been set.
</P>
<P>
   Boucher said is concerned that Pope's health has deteriorated
sharply since his incarceration.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our understanding is that he has not had good medical care,''
Boucher said. I'm not sure if there's been a local doctor, a prison
doctor or not. But we have felt strongly that he needed to have our
embassy physician make an independent assessment and give medical
advice.''
</P>
<P>
   State Department concern about Pope has been heightened by the
death of a U.S. citizen, Yefim Skurkovich, who officials say died
because of improperly treated ailments in late July while in a
Russian prison.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are angered by the failure of Russian authorities to
provide adequate medical attention to this U.S. citizen,'' said a
State Department official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   ''This only underscores the urgency of our request to have our
embassy physician see Mr. Pope as a first step until he can be
fully examined by an independent physician,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials described Skurkovich as a 51-year old businessman who
had lived in Russia for two or three years, but had no other
immediate information.
</P>
<P>
   As for Pope, Boucher said the Russians maintain only consular
officials not other diplomats can make prison visits. The U.S.
Embassy doctor has diplomatic status.
</P>
<P>
   Boucher said international conventions allow consular officials
to be accompanied by other diplomats and the United States permits
such visits to U.S. prisons.
</P>
<P>
   However he said he did not think it would help Americans
traveling in Russia if the United States retaliated by restricting
visits to Russians imprisoned in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. consular officials have visited Pope nine times since his
arrest,counting Thursday's session. His wife, Sheryl, saw him last
month in Moscow's Lefortovo Prison and said he has lost
considerable weight.
</P>
<P>
   He runs CERF Technologies International, a consulting firm in
State College, Pa., that developed commercial contacts with Russian
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Curt Weldon, R-Pa., an expert on U.S.-Russian relations,
has taken up Pope's case. He contends the arrest was an attempt by
Russian authorities to show that they have clamped down on spying.

<HEADLINE> Jury finds Ex-Serbian leader owes $745 million for wartime horrors  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - A jury, sending a symbolic message about the
value of human life in a war-torn country, decided Thursday that a
former Bosnian Serb leader should pay $745 million for atrocities
committed by his soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   The jury had deliberated since Wednesday afternoon after hearing
tearful testimony from several women who described how their lives
were shattered after Serbian soldiers included them in what the
plaintiffs' lawyers say was a campaign of ethnic cleansing.
</P>
<P>
   Maria T. Vullo, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said she told her
clients immediately after the verdict that lawyers would do
everything possible to try to recover the money from former Bosnian
Serb leader Radovan Karadzic.
</P>
<P>
   She said she believed he has millions of dollars in assets,
including the homes he took from thousands of victims.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict, she said, will ''tell everyone this really
happened. These women were raped. Genocide occurred and he's
responsible for this.''
</P>
<P>
   ''What this case establishes is that rape is a form of
genocide,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The jury awarded $265 million in compensatory damages and $480
million in punitive damages, including $70 million for a woman who
son was murdered before she was taken to an underground camp and
raped repeatedly.
</P>
<P>
   Another plaintiff, Jadranka Cigelj, of Zagreb, Croatia, said the
verdict was ''a tremendous success.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's like hikers when they reach the high point of the
mountain,'' said the former corporate lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Cigelj said she has wondered at times whether those who died in
camps where they were interned were better off than those who
lived.
</P>
<P>
   ''But for us it was a great fortune that we were here for this
verdict,'' Cigelj said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are happy,'' said another victim, Nusreta Sivac, who was a
civil judge in Prijedor, Bosnia when she encountered the Serbs.
''We have moral satisfaction. it was worthwhile waiting seven years
to see this.''
</P>
<P>
   During the two-week trial, rape victims described the attacks in
the early 1990s by soldiers wearing pictures of Karadzic. Jurors
sometimes cried as they listened. After the verdict was read aloud,
a dozen plaintiffs stood and applauded.
</P>
<P>
   One juror, leaving the courthouse afterward, said the victims
who testified were ''very brave, wonderful and dignified ladies who
deserved justice for the indignities they suffered.''
</P>
<P>
   Karadzic, an international fugitive, was previous indicted by
the U.N. war crimes tribunal in The Hague, Netherlands, on charges
of genocide against other communities in the former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   He was named in a lawsuit brought in Manhattan on behalf of 15
women and two survivor groups under a 221-year-old U.S. law letting
foreign citizens sue foreign officials and citizens for violating
the law of nations.
</P>
<P>
   Karadzic fought the lawsuit through New York lawyers for four
years before sending a letter to U.S. District Judge Peter K.
Leisure, saying he would not defend himself.
</P>
<P>
   ''Can you really hope to find truth or do justice or protect
rights for people in distant nations?'' he wrote. ''Do you really
believe that attaching a U.S. dollar sign to human tragedy around
the world by empty judgments in uncontested lawsuits is a step
toward peace or justice?''
</P>
<P>
   Leisure ruled that Karadzic defaulted in the lawsuit, leaving
the jury only to decide what he owed the plaintiffs for
compensatory and punitive damages.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the women said the brutal actions of the Bosnian
Serbs arose from their attempt to rid the country of people unlike
themselves, targeting in particular those of Croatian ancestry and
Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers had urged the jury to send a message to the world
that wartime atrocities, especially when women are targeted, will
not go unpunished.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the multimillion dollar verdict, it was likely to be a
long fight to try to recover money from the fugitive whose picture
during the trial was taped to a courtroom defense table chair.
</P>
<P>
   Tears often poured forth as supporters of those who testified
listened to the stories of how normal lives were pushed to horrible
ends in a land where the expectation of death and rape was more
reliable than a daily meal.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Frees Rights Activist on Bail  </HEADLINE>
By SALAH NASRAWI
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- Prosecutors on Thursday freed a prominent
critic of the Egyptian government whose detention without charge
for more than five weeks had sparked protests from international
rights groups and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Saad Eddin Ibrahim arrived at his south Cairo home from a Cairo
prison to an exuberant family welcome, said his wife, Barbara.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's pretty chaotic, but happy chaos,'' she said in a
telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   Ibrahim, who has U.S. and Egyptian citizenship, said he had been
treated well, ''although it was a prison,'' and made clear the
experience had not deterred him. He said he would resume his work,
as a sociology professor at the American University in Cairo and
director of a think tank, after resting two or three days.
</P>
<P>
   ''I decided early on in my life that I will raise my voice in
defense of every honorable cause. I have no red lines and I will
continue to do that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Farid el-Dib said the investigation of Saad Eddin
Ibrahim, an outspoken critic of the Egyptian government, would
continue and that he had been ordered to post bail a $2,600 bail.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm pleased to see Mr. Saad Eddin out of this dilemma,''
el-Dib said. ''I will continue defending him. I believe the
accusations made against him cannot stand in any court of
justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors had no immediate comment.
</P>
<P>
   According to lawyers and Egypt's official Middle East News
Agency, four other associates of Ibrahim also were given bail,
while seven others remained in detention. All those released were
banned from leaving the country, MENA said.
</P>
<P>
   The 61-year-old Ibrahim was arrested June 30. He could have been
held up six months without trial under Egyptian law.
</P>
<P>
   Amnesty International, which had protested the detention, said
it welcomed the release of Ibrahim and his colleagues, but
''remained concerned that the charges brought against them have,
some 45 days after their arrest, yet to be clarified and
substantiated.''
</P>
<P>
   Ibrahim said he was not sure why he had been freed, but ''the
prosecutors had asked all the questions they wanted to ask and
finally ... we were only chatting.''
</P>
<P>
   He doubted that pressure from the United States had played a
role in his release.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know President (Hosni) Mubarak personally,'' Ibrahim said.
''He is too independent, stubborn and proud to yield to pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   Ibrahim said all the prosecutors' accusations were political.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were aimed at my position as a public figure. They were
directed at my activities which are all of a political nature. Even
the questions about receiving foreign funding were political
because it is all about elections.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Ibrahim had said he was questioned about whether he
accepted foreign money without government permission and forged
ballots for a documentary film about elections that allegedly would
have tarnished Egypt's image.
</P>
<P>
   Ibrahim confirmed he had been accused of spying for the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ''These were the most stupid and naive accusations that they
made. Even the prosecutors themselves were surprised,'' he said,
adding these allegations stemmed from the state security forces.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Ends Down 94; Dow Ends Up 3  </HEADLINE>
By DUNSTAN PRIAL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks closed mostly lower Thursday as
technology shares slumped on fears that earnings will decline
during the second half of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index fell 93.51 to 3,759.99, while the Dow
Jones industrial average closed up a scant 2.93 at 10,908.76. The
broader Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index fell 12.62 to 1,460.25.
</P>
<P>
   Trading was marked by caution as fears that earnings could slow
in the second half of 2000 re-emerged as a factor in the market.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a lot of nervousness in the technology sector. The
valuations are so high in that area that they can brook no
disappointments,'' said Michael Metz, a managing director and
portfolio manager at CIBC World Markets in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Semiconductor equipment maker Applied Materials fell $2.875 to
$69.25 despite third-quarter earnings that beat Wall Street's
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Applied Material's earnings report helped drag down the entire
technology sector. Even Cisco Systems, a hero on Wednesday for
beating Wall Street's earnings expectations, was punished, falling
$4.438 to $63.375.
</P>
<P>
   Dell Computer, one of the biggest personal computer makers in
the country, suffered a similar fate after the end of regular
trading. Despite beating analysts' earnings expectations and
announcing that sales should remain strong through the end of the
year, Dell's shares fell $1.375 to $40.375 as of 5:30 p.m. EDT in
after-hours trading, after falling 6.25 cents to $41.75 during the
regular session.
</P>
<P>
   On the New York Stock Exchange, retailer Gap was down $4.50 at
$27 after announcing that second-half earnings might be lower than
earlier predictions.
</P>
<P>
   Metz said investor expectations have grown so high during the
decade-long bull market that even companies that meet but fail to
beat Wall Street's earnings targets are being punished.
</P>
<P>
   A similar dynamic emerged a month ago when bellwether companies
such as Microsoft, Intel and Apple Computer served as catalysts for
tech stocks selloffs after reporting earnings that either met or
beat analyst forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. stock markets have fallen into a pattern in which blue chip
and technology stocks rise and fall on alternate days.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, blue chips fell, dragged down by a selloff in drug
stocks following a court ruling that could speed up the sale of a
generic version of the antidepressant drug Prozac. Tech stocks
rose, meanwhile, on Cisco's solid earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Internet retailer stocks lagged once again Thursday, unable to
recover from two broadsides this week from Wall Street analysts.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, influential Merrill Lynch analyst Henry Blodgett said
he believes 75 percent of existing Internet companies will fold or
merge into other companies in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
   And Wednesday, a Sanford Bernstein analyst initiated coverage of
Internet retailer Amazon.com at a rating of ''underperform,''
meaning the analyst doesn't expect Amazon's stock to perform as
well as the broader market.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon shares were down 43.70 cents at $30.438, and most other
Internet retailer stocks followed suit, notably Priceline.com, down
$1.875 at $23.75.
</P>
<P>
   Market watchers say the overall market's alternating trading
pattern should continue until investors get a clearer idea as to
whether Federal Reserve Board policy makers intend to raise
interest rates at their next meeting Aug. 22.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues slightly outnumbered advancers on the New York
Stock Exchange, where volume came to 936.96 million shares, down
from Wednesday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index fell 5.85 to 501.65.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.37 percent.
Germany's DAX index was up 0.75 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was
down 0.42 percent, and France's CAC-40 was down 0.11 percent.

<HEADLINE> U.S. May Train African Peacekeepers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon probably will send several
hundred soldiers to Nigeria and Ghana to train those West African
countries' soldiers for peacekeeping duty in Sierra Leone,
officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said no final decision has been
made on the number of American troops to be involved, but that a
small group of U.S. soldiers now in Nigeria and Ghana are expected
to complete an assessment by the end of the week on the assistance
those two countries will require.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's reasonable to assume that once they complete
their work it would require several hundred U.S. trainers and
support personnel to train several battalions in Nigeria, Ghana and
maybe another country,'' Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
   In Sierra Leone, guerrillas of the Revolutionary United Front
are waging war against government forces and in May kidnapped
hundreds of United Nations troops. In response to the U.N.
peacekeeping crisis there, President Clinton pledged $20 million to
bolster the effort. The training of Nigerian and Ghanian soldiers
is part of that, Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the Pentagon's announcement, Republican presidential
candidate George W. Bush said: ''It depends on how long the
commitment is. If it is a limited amount with a good focus, then
I'll be supporters,'' he told reporters while campaigning in
California.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who was traveling with Bush, added
that troop deployments under the Clinton administration have
suffered from ''a lack of cohesion, a lack of focus.''

<HEADLINE> Gymnast Phelps Out of Olympic Trials  </HEADLINE>
By NANCY ARMOUR
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Jaycie Phelps' knees hurt too much to even take her dog for
a walk, she knew her Olympic dream was over.
</P>
<P>
   With the Sydney Games only a month away, the second-youngest
member of the Magnificent Seven announced Thursday she was
withdrawing from next week's U.S. Olympic gymnastics trials because
of chronic knee problems.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was really tough. Probably one of the tougher decisions
I've had to make,'' Phelps said. ''I don't have enough time now to
get my knee fixed and have enough time to train.''
</P>
<P>
   Four other members of the first American women's team to win
Olympic gold, at Atlanta in 1996, are expected to compete next
week. Combined scores from trials (60 percent) and last month's
U.S. Gymnastics Championships (40 percent) will be used to rank the
gymnasts, and a selection committee headed by Bela Karolyi then
will choose the six-person squad.
</P>
<P>
   Phelps, 20, wasn't even supposed to get this far. She's had knee
problems throughout her career, and her left knee was surgically
repaired three times. After her last operation, to replace the
meniscus in her left knee in 1997, doctors told her she shouldn't
do gymnastics again.
</P>
<P>
   When she decided last November to try for the Sydney Olympics,
doctors cautioned her against doing the vault or floor exercise
because the pounding would put too much stress on her knee. She
went ahead and trained for all four events, anyway, trying to
absorb most of the pounding with her right leg.
</P>
<P>
   But by trying to protect her left leg, coach Geoff Eaton said,
she injured her right leg and now has some fraying in the meniscus
of her right knee. Rather than risk further injury, Phelps decided
to withdraw from the Olympic trials.
</P>
<P>
   ''We knew it was a long shot and it's too bad the cards fell
this way for us, but at least we tried. At least we gave it that
shot,'' Eaton said. ''It's much better to try and know than not
(try) at all and always wonder.''
</P>
<P>
   This isn't retirement, though. Phelps said she plans to have her
knee cleaned out soon, participate in the post-Olympic tour and
some professional events. If those go well, she might compete in
some elite-level individual competitions.
</P>
<P>
   She also plans to start school at Arizona State and do some
coaching.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's in my best interest to do this right now, get the knee
fixed and hopefully I can do some things in 2001,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Phelps started feeling pain about a week before nationals, but
decided to compete in the all-around preliminaries. She struggled
to a 17th-place finish, and her highest score was a 9.050 on the
balance beam.
</P>
<P>
   She withdrew before the finals there because of her injury.
After taking some time to think about it, Phelps decided it was
best to pull out of the Olympic trials, too.
</P>
<P>
   ''I came back to start training and I did a couple of workouts
and it got to the point where I couldn't walk out of the gym,'' she
said. ''I couldn't take my dog for walk, I couldn't get up my
stairs.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a tough decision, but Eaton said it was the right one.
</P>
<P>
   ''Of course it's disappointing, especially for Jaycie. But we
knew this going in,'' Eaton said. ''Jaycie is a very, very gifted
athlete. This was solely a matter of her body not allowing her to
go any further.''

<HEADLINE> Pak: Harmon Is Too Busy With Woods  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO
<TEXT>
<P>
   AYLMER, Quebec (AP) -- Se Ri Pak says she has dropped coach Butch
Harmon because he's too busy with his other pupil, Tiger Woods.
</P>
<P>
   Pak, who has yet to win on the LPGA Tour this year, on Thursday
said she and Harmon -- mostly Harmon -- are too busy to get together
except for ''maybe three times'' on ''one or two days'' a few
months ago.
</P>
<P>
   After shooting a 3-under 69 during the first round of the du
Maurier Classic, Pak said it is impossible to coordinate her
schedule, Harmon's and Woods' to create time for her and Harmon to
work together. Harmon has been Woods' teacher for more than seven
years and has been known to drop everything and fly to where his
star pupil is if Woods' swing needs special attention.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think they are getting together a long time,'' Pak said. ''I
know that he's more important, because he's Tiger. ... So I
decided, actually, I don't think it's going to work that well.''
</P>
<P>
   Following the du Maurier, Pak said, ''I think I've got to find a
coach after this week.''
</P>
<P>
   ''So this is my last week for being by myself in practice,'' Pak
said.
</P>
<P>
   She gave no hint as to who she might hire.
</P>
<P>
   Pak and David Leadbetter ended their relationship in late 1998,
with Leadbetter complaining of being a ''tennis ball'' because of
his ''on again, off again, on again, off again'' status coaching
the Korean star.
</P>
<P>
   Pak has not won on tour this year and is 14th on the money list
after finishing second in 1998 and third in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Harmon's other clients include Darren Clarke and Mark
Calcavecchia.

<HEADLINE> Major Leaguers To Go to Japan Again  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- San Francisco's Barry Bonds and Seattle's
Kazuhiro Sasaki were picked Thursday to play for a major league
All-Star team that will play eight games in Japan in November.
</P>
<P>
   The remainder of the roster will be filled out later this
season, the commissioner's office said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The series opens Nov. 3 at the Tokyo Dome, where games also will
be played the following two days.
</P>
<P>
   After a day off, the All-Stars play Nov. 7 at Fukuoka, Nov. 8 at
Osaka, Nov. 9 at Nagoya. The series concludes with games Nov. 11 at
Seibu and Nov. 12 at the Tokyo Dome.
</P>
<P>
   Sasaki, who has 28 saves in his first season with the Mariners,
played for Yokohama for 10 years and holds Japan's Central League
records for saves in a season (45) and career (229).
</P>
<P>
   In the last All-Star tour of Japan, major leaguers won the
series 6-2 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The major league All-Stars will have 28 players, a roster
jointly selected by the commissioner's office and the Major League
Baseball Players Association.

<HEADLINE> Pernice Takes Back Seat to Tiger  </HEADLINE>
By HARRY ATKINS
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND BLANC, Mich. (AP) -- Tom Pernice wore a big pin on his cap,
a gift from his daughters, Kristen and Brooke. It read: ''This dad
is loved a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Good thing, because hardly anyone else at Warwick Hills Golf and
Country Club seemed to care much about Pernice during the first
round of the Buick Open on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Pernice was the defending champion, but Tiger Woods -- in his
first tournament since completing the Grand Slam with a victory at
the British Open last month -- was in the next fairway.
</P>
<P>
   Guess where all the fans were?
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a fact of life,'' Pernice said. ''All the people are here
to see Tiger, and that's to be expected.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods, playing in a group with Davis Love III and Tom Purtzer,
teed off on No. 1 at 7:39 a.m. Eight minutes later, Pernice, paired
with Tom Scherrer and John Cook, went off on the 10th.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the early hour, and the chill of a brisk wind rolling
dark clouds out of the northwest, thousands of fans were already on
the grounds -- with thousands more pouring through the gates.
</P>
<P>
   ''In all my years, I've never seen this many people here this
early -- especially on a Thursday,'' said Joe Dowling, a marshall
working his 26th Buick Open. ''In years past, this would be a
Sunday crowd.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been 88,000 individual tickets sold for this year's
tournament, a substantial hike from the 54,000 sold last year. For
the week, upwards of 144,000 fans are likely to attend -- most
hoping to get a glimpse of greatness.
</P>
<P>
   Only a handful of curious onlookers took notice of Pernice and
his group. That proved both good and bad.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the silence was less than golden. An example:
</P>
<P>
   At No. 15, the sixth hole of the day for his threesome, Pernice
walked up to one of the few fans standing around the tee.
</P>
<P>
   ''Take your hands out of your pockets,'' Pernice told the man as
Scherrer got ready to tee off. ''You're rattling your change.''
</P>
<P>
   The man gave him a puzzled look, but eventually complied.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   TOO LITTLE, TOO LATE: Fred Couples hasn't given up hope that
Ken Venturi might consider him as a captain's pick for the
Presidents Cup. That's why Couples is playing the Buick Open.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been playing a little more, practicing a little more,''
said Couples, who has played in every Presidents Cup since it began
in 1994. ''I still have a chance to make the Presidents Cup team,
which would be a great thing.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whoever plays extremely well has a better shot. If I don't
embarrass myself, I'm sure I'll be in a pool of five or six
players.''
</P>
<P>
   Venturi was quick to mention Couples' name when he was selected
as the U.S. captain a year ago. But he is 29th in the standings.
Only the top 10 qualify, along with two wild cards named by
Venturi, and Couples likely would have to get into top 20 to merit
consideration.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a big deal for me to make that team,'' Couples said.
</P>
<P>
   Couples provided the two more memorable shots at the Robert
Trent Jones Golf Club in Virginia, site of the October matches. He
hit an approach into 1 foot to beat Nick Price on the last hole in
1994, and he holed a 35-footer on No. 17 to beat Vijay Singh in
1996 for the decisive point.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   BAD OMEN: Davis Love III was just off the ninth fairway as he
neared completion of his first round. Trouble was, he was playing
the 18th hole.
</P>
<P>
   That was typical of the way Love drove the ball Thursday, when
he hit only four of 14 fairways but still managed a 1-under 71.
</P>
<P>
   Love jokingly traced the problem to his pro-am the day before.
</P>
<P>
   He said he split the middle on every fairway. When he got to his
last hole -- No. 9 on Wednesday -- one of his partners said, ''You
know what's wrong with your driving? You're too boring. You need to
duck-hook one or something.''
</P>
<P>
   Love proceeded to hook his drive onto the adjacent 18th fairway.
</P>
<P>
   ''And I've been hitting like that ever since,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   Divots: Steve Elkington withdrew from the tournament,
complaining of a sore hip. ... David Sutherland had a difficult lie
on the par-3 eighth. His tee shot landed in the canvas chair of
Sharon Ploof, from nearby Davidson, wedged between her left leg and
her purse. After consulting with a rules official, Sutherland got a
drop, but bogeyed the hole.

<HEADLINE> WNBA Playoffs To Begin  </HEADLINE>
By MELISSA MURPHY
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Houston Comets, the only champions the WNBA
has ever had, are in an unfamiliar position heading into the WNBA
playoffs. They're the No. 2 seed.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Sparks, who swept the three-time defending
champions during the regular season, have the top spot as the WNBA
playoffs begin Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''The difference is their maturity,'' Houston coach Van
Chancellor said. ''(Coach) Michael Cooper has got them playing
together. They are willing to give up the ball for the good of the
team so they can dethrone us. That is their whole mission.''
</P>
<P>
   But first, Los Angeles (28-4) will need to get past the Phoenix
Mercury (20-12) in the best-of-three opening round of the Western
Conference playoffs. On Saturday, Houston (27-5) will face the
Sacramento Monarchs (21-11).
</P>
<P>
   In the Eastern Conference, the Orlando Miracle (16-16) play host
to the Cleveland Rockers (17-15) on Friday, while the New York
Liberty (20-12) travel to Washington to play the Mystics (14-18) on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in the league's four-year history, the Comets
are not conference regular-season champions. Los Angeles won all
three games against the Comets, including a 10-point win at the
Compaq Center, to become the only team to win consecutive
regular-season series against Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a magical aura there,'' Cooper said of the Comets'
52-9 regular-season home record. ''It's about getting past the
mystique and realizing defensively what you need to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper, the 1987 NBA defensive player of the year with the Los
Angeles Lakers, has made defense a priority for the Sparks. They
are holding opponents to a league-low 39.5 percent shooting from
the field.
</P>
<P>
   Houston can become the first professional basketball team to win
four consecutive championships since the Boston Celtics (1959-66).
It could be the final championship run for Cynthia Cooper, the
three-time WNBA championship MVP, who may retire after the season.
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor denied that Cooper's midseason announcement had been
a distraction for the team.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know that this is her last season,'' Chancellor said.
''If she wanted to make it her swan song, if she got 40 points in
Sacramento, it wouldn't bother me a bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston's Sheryl Swoopes is the WNBA's top scorer (20.6) -- a
spot Cooper held the last three seasons -- and a candidate for the
league MVP award.
</P>
<P>
   ''She's tougher mentally,'' Chancellor said of Swoopes. ''She's
putting the ball on the floor, playing better defense and
rebounding. And you always need a scorer.''
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles is anchored by Lisa Leslie, who is averaging 17.8
points and 9.5 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ''Not to take anything away from Sheryl Swoopes, but I think
Lisa Leslie is the MVP of the league,'' Michael Cooper said. ''Lisa
is a premier big (player), commands double teams, and distributes
the ball to perimeter players. She's number one to me in altering
shots.''
</P>
<P>
   The Liberty defended their the Eastern Conference title, but
coach Richie Adubato disagrees with the format that sends the top
seed on the road for Game 1.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our belief is when you earn the right to homecourt advantage,
you earn the right to play the first game at home,'' said Adubato,
whose team is 12-4 at Madison Square Garden. ''I would like a 1-1-1
setup, but obviously the league feels differently.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mystics won the season series 2-1 against New York, and have
won five of seven meetings. Washington's Chamique Holdsclaw, the
1999 rookie of the year, hit the game-winning jumper at the Garden
on July 13.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've got to try to contain her,'' Adubato said. ''She's
blossomed into a premier player who can carry her team.''
</P>
<P>
   Adubato, a former assistant coach for the New York Knicks, will
be coaching against former Knick Darrell Walker.
</P>
<P>
   Walker, who served as interim coach with the NBA's Washington
Wizards last season, took over the Mystics when Nancy Darsch
resigned at midseason. Darsch's triangle offense has given way to
an offense that features Holdsclaw.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're getting her some more touches in the post,'' Walker
said. ''I told Meek when I took over, 'If you want to be a star in
this league ... you have to be more of a leader in practice and on
the court.'''
</P>
<P>
   New York guard Teresa Weatherspoon is recovering from a broken
nose and a slight concussion suffered against Orlando on Aug. 4.
Last season, Weatherspoon hit the 50-foot shot at the buzzer
against Houston to extend the WNBA Finals to a third game.
</P>
<P>
   ''She's bounced right back,'' Adubato said. ''She hasn't missed
a game for three years. She's a very determined athlete who is
going to play unless she's in a wheelchair.''

<HEADLINE> Jazz Poised To Sign Crotty  </HEADLINE>
By TIM KORTE
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Point guard John Crotty reached an
agreement Thursday with the Utah Jazz, probably signaling the end
of Howard Eisley's tenure with the team.
</P>
<P>
   Crotty, 31, will sign a contract Friday, Jazz officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The length of the contract wasn't disclosed, but as a seven-year
veteran, Crotty will earn $736,00 next season under the NBA's
collective bargaining agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The deal comes two days after Utah re-signed Jacque Vaughn to be
the No. 2 point guard behind John Stockton.
</P>
<P>
   Eisley, who played behind Stockton last season, was Utah's top
priority when the free-agent negotiating period opened July 1, but
talks between the Jazz and Eisley's agent, Dan Fegan, broke down.
</P>
<P>
   Jazz vice president Kevin O'Connor withdrew the team's reported
five-year, $20 million offer on Monday. Fegan had been seeking a
six-year, $30 million deal.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Fegan nor O'Connor returned messages seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor said during Vaughn's news conference that coach Jerry
Sloan hoped to acquire a third point guard. The 38-year-old
Stockton has spent less time on the practice court in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Eisley averaged 8.6 points and shot 41 percent last season.
</P>
<P>
   Crotty, meanwhile, will return to Utah after four seasons with
five other teams: Cleveland, Miami, Portland, Seattle and Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   He played for the Jazz from 1992-95, after signing as an
undrafted free agent from Virginia. He spent last season in
Detroit, averaging 4.7 points and 1.9 assists in 13.6 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   During his first stint in Utah, Crotty played in 165 games,
averaging 3.2 points and 2 assists in 9.5 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the Jazz signed shooting guard John Starks
to a $2.25 million exception. Utah also offered a $1.2 million
salary-cap exception to veteran forward Danny Manning.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Discourages Taiwan Meeting  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Wary of inflaming relations with China, the
State Department said Thursday it would not look favorably on a
proposal by members of Congress to meet with Taiwanese President
Chen Shui-bian when he stops in Los Angeles this weekend while en
route to the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman Richard Boucher said the administration sees Chen's
visit as an overnight layover only, and not a reason for official
activities.
</P>
<P>
   ''We would expect activities to be consistent with the purpose
of transiting and for the safety, comfort and convenience of the
traveler,'' Boucher said.
</P>
<P>
   Two California congressmen have requested private meetings with
Chen. One is Republican Dana Rohrabacher, a prominent congressional
China critic; the other is Democrat Howard Berman.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Rohrabacher, Ricardo Bernal, said the Clinton
administration has pressured Chen not to meet with the lawmakers
and that Chen has passed word that ''it would be difficult'' for
any such meeting to take place.
</P>
<P>
   Bernal said Rohrabacher was still exploring whether a meeting
could be arranged. Efforts to obtain comment from Berman's office
were unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   China objected to the U.S. decision to issue Chen a visa for the
layover and warned that it would severely damage U.S. ties with
China.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao expressed ''strong
resentment and firm opposition'' to the decision.
</P>
<P>
   China regards Taiwan as a renegade province and is
extraordinarily sensitive to any activity that would give Chen
increased international legitimacy.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan is a hot-button issue for the State Department as well.
U.S.-Chinese dialogue on Taiwan hit a low point in 1995 when the
administration granted a visa to then-President Lee Teng-hui to
visit Cornell University, his alma mater, despite giving Beijing
assurances that no visa would be issued.
</P>
<P>
   Boucher said Chen will be greeted as a courtesy by the chairman
of the nominally private organization that oversees unofficial
relations with Taiwan. The United States has no official relations
with Taiwan; it traded them in 1979 for relations with China.
</P>
<P>
   Boucher brushed aside questions about the lawmakers' proposed
meetings with Chen. Privately, a senior official said that the
administration is not in a position to tell a member of Congress
with whom he or she can meet.
</P>
<P>
   But in a letter sent Tuesday to Stanley Roth, the State
Department's top official for East Asia, Rohrabacher complained
that requests from members of Congress to meet privately with Chen
had been denied.
</P>
<P>
   ''In order for the United States to retain its role-model status
as the world's democratic leader, President Chen and his entourage
should be permitted to enjoy the basic rights of freedom of speech
and assembly,'' Rohrabacher said.
</P>
<P>
   Boucher took issue with Rohrabacher's claim of a denial. ''There
is no procedure or request that we get that we approve or deny,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bernal, Rohrabacher's spokesman, said the administration has
been telling the Taiwanese that it would not be in their interest
for Chen to meet with members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The Taiwanese information office did not immediately return a
call seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Chen's two-week trip, beginning Sunday, includes Dominica,
Nicaragua, and Costa Rica, and the African countries of Gambia,
Burkina Faso and Chad. They are among the 29 countries with which
Taiwan maintains diplomatic relations.

<HEADLINE> Krayzelburg Aims for American Dream  </HEADLINE>
By BETH HARRIS
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Lenny Krayzelburg is a star in the making.
All he needs are two Olympic gold medals and the Ukrainian-born
swimmer, who didn't speak English 11 years ago, can realize his
American dream.
</P>
<P>
   Krayzelburg goes for his first Olympic berth when he swims the
100-meter backstroke Friday night at the U.S. trials. He tuned up
with the fastest qualifying time in Thursday's preliminaries.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel confident I can swim fast enough to be the best,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   His past performances certainly back him up. Krayzelburg set the
world and American records of 53.60 seconds last August.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is an important meet for me to make a statement,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The 24-year-old moved to the United States from Odessa, Ukraine,
in 1989, and became an American citizen in 1995. He trains at the
University of Southern California, and lives close to his parents
in Studio City.
</P>
<P>
   Krayzelburg speaks with barely any trace of a Russian accent,
and that, along with his blond hair, blue eyes and amicable
personality have already made him a hit with sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   Even before he boards a plane for Sydney, Krayzelburg has seven
endorsement deals that earn him a reported six-figure income. Two
gold medals could launch him into the superstar category.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hopefully I will do well enough to deal with that afterward,''
he said. ''I try not to think about the pressure. Nothing is really
for sure until you touch the wall.''
</P>
<P>
   The top two finishers in most events make the Olympic team,
which means many swimmers are as happy with second as they are with
first at trials. Not Krayzelburg.
</P>
<P>
   ''Second is just as good as first, except for me,'' he said. ''I
want to come in here and establish myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Krayzelburg was upset by 17-year-old Aaron Peirsol
in the 200 backstroke at a meet in Los Angeles. It was
Krayzelburg's first loss in the event in two years.
</P>
<P>
   ''I went out too fast and I was struggling,'' he said. ''With
rest, I felt my body was going to come around.''
</P>
<P>
   Krayzelburg and Peirsol will meet in Friday's 100 back final,
but Peirsol's stronger event is the 200 backstroke, where he and
Krayzelburg will swim prelims Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Neil Walker may have something to say about Krayzelburg's finish
in the 100. Walker, who qualified second for the final, set a world
record in the 100 at this year's short course world championships.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was a huge turning point for me,'' he said. ''I have a
lot of confidence going into the trials.''
</P>
<P>
   The women backstrokers will share Friday's spotlight with their
male counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   B.J. Bedford, who's medaled in every major international meet
outside the Olympics, leads the field for the women's 100 final.
</P>
<P>
   Among her near-misses at three previous trials was a third-place
finish in '96. Bedford's mother, Jane, decided to stay home this
week.
</P>
<P>
   ''My mom thinks it's her fault I haven't qualified,'' Bedford
said. ''She thinks she jinxed me in '88, '92 and '96.''
</P>
<P>
   Bedford took six months off after the '96 trials only to be
tortured by having the Atlanta Olympics on TV at the sports bar in
Austin, Texas, where she worked pouring drinks.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was like, 'Get that crap off the TV,''' she said, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   Also Friday are finals in the men's 200 freestyle and the
women's 100 breaststroke, where 16-year-old Megan Quann lowered her
own American record in Thursday's prelims.
</P>
<P>
   Josh Davis, whose three relay golds in Atlanta were the most by
any man, briefly threatened Matt Biondi's 12-year-old American
record during Thursday's 200 free prelims.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Criticizes Chavez's Iraq Visit  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The State Department said Thursday the visit
of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez ''bestows an aura of
respectability upon Saddam Hussein, which he clearly does not
deserve.''
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman Richard Boucher said the visit was inappropriate based
on Saddam's ''behavior in the past, invading, occupying neighboring
countries and repressing his own people.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the administration does not necessarily see the visit as
a reason for imposing sanctions against Venezuela or retaliating in
some other way.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez, who met with Saddam on Thursday, is the first foreign
leader to visit Iraq since the U.N. security Council imposed
sanctions against Iraq following its invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Boucher said the Iraqi media ''have seized on this visit as a
propaganda tool. And Iraq in its press statements has once again
demonstrated that Saddam Hussein is going to use any pretext to
maintain his rejection of the requirements established by the
United Nations.''

<HEADLINE> Burns Leads AT&AMP;T Canada Senior Open  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- George Burns had a hole-in-one in a
7-under-par 65 Thursday and held a one-stroke lead over three
players after the first round of the $1.45 million AT&AMP;T Canada
Senior Open.
</P>
<P>
   Burns, whose caddie was a local 16-year-old, aced the 174-yard
2nd hole at the St. Charles Country Club with a 6-iron.
</P>
<P>
   Walter Hall, Hugh Baiocchi and Ed Dougherty all had 66s, while
Leonard Thompson and Doug Tewell were another stroke back.
</P>
<P>
   Burns had more to say about his caddie than the ace that
one-hopped into the cup.
</P>
<P>
   ''I putted extremely well today, thanks to the young fellow,''
he said, referring to local caddie Stewart Bannatyne. ''He knows
these greens inside and out. The only putt I missed badly was on
(the par-4) 16th, and that's the only one I went against his read.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the best I've putted in a long, long time. I can't
really put a finger on why, but I owe a lot to the youngster.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns, a resident of Boynton Beach, Fla., has had limited
success on the Senior PGA Tour, partly due to a string of nagging
injuries the last few seasons. But some time spent recently on the
European Senior Tour has given his confidence a much-needed boost.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm playing a lot more relaxed right now, and that's probably
helped,'' he said. ''I haven't put any pressure on myself to win
overseas. I've mostly been concentrating on just healing up my
body.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns made the turn at three under after the hole-in-one and a
birdie at the par-5 5th. He added birdies on Nos. 12 and 13 before
closing out his bogey-free round with a 9-foot birdie putt on 18.
</P>
<P>
   Hall capped his round with a 60-foot chip-in for eagle on the
par-5 18th.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Nicklaus, competing in this championship for the first time
in five years, had the galleries roaring. The Golden Bear was five
under through 16 holes before making a bogey out of a bunker on the
par-3 17th. He closed out with a par and had a 68 to finished tied
with Tom Wargo, Tom Jenkins, John Bland and John Morgan.
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus, who had the ball close to the hole all day, felt his
score could have easily been much lower.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm leaving my putter at the golf course, because I don't want
to talk to it tonight,'' he joked. ''(My score) certainly could
have been better. ... I probably could have been 63 or 64 if I'd
have made a few more putts. But everyone wants that. That's nothing
new.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm pretty excited to be right up there (on the leaderboard).
I haven't been to Canada in several years, and this is a new golf
course for me. I've got some confidence, and hopefully that will
allow me to play better as we move through the weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   Baiocchi, even through 11 holes, caught fire with birdies on
Nos. 12 and 13, an eagle at 14 and another birdie at 15. He closed
out with a birdie on the final hole.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wasn't expecting anything standing on the 12th tee, but I
sure got rolling,'' he said. ''My short game got very hot all of a
sudden.''

<HEADLINE> Eight dead crows test positive for West Nile virus  </HEADLINE>
By DONNA TOMMELLEO
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - Following a pattern predicted by
environmental officials, more dead birds have tested positive for
the West Nile virus in several Connecticut towns.
</P>
<P>
   Eight crows carrying the potentially fatal disease were found in
Stamford, Milford, Greenwich, Norwalk, Westport and Cheshire,
environmental and health officials announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the birds were found in Stamford, where the first
positive results from a mosquito were found on July 21. The eight
birds were collected between July 5-31.
</P>
<P>
   ''We won't be surprised to see 10 or 20 Connecticut towns fall
in the next couple weeks,'' said state epidemiologist Dr. James
Hadler.
</P>
<P>
   He stressed, as state health officials have for several weeks,
that the risk of humans contracting the mosquito-borne disease is
extremely low.
</P>
<P>
   Humans cannot contract the virus from birds. The batch of
mosquitos that tested positive in Fairfield County were of the
bird-biting variety.
</P>
<P>
   Since the first positive result on that pool of mosquitos three
weeks ago, all other positive findings have been in birds.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental officials plan no new spraying as a result of the
latest results, but do intend to step up mosquito trapping and
larvicide application. Six more traps will be placed in Cheshire,
bringing the total to more than 80 statewide.
</P>
<P>
   ''We spray when we find positive mosquitoes, not positive
birds,'' said Arthur Rocque, commissioner of the state Department
of Environmental Protection.
</P>
<P>
   Rocque said about 100 dead birds are awaiting testing. Most have
been collected from Fairfield County. So far, 10 dead birds have
tested positive for the virus.
</P>
<P>
   A positive result on a dead crow last week in Columbia marked
the first such finding in eastern Connecticut. The most recent
positive results, said Rocque, ''tells us the virus is pretty well
established in the northeast.''
</P>
<P>
   The virus first surfaced in the region last year, killing seven
people - all of whom were over 75 - and sickening 62 others in New
York. It also killed hundreds of birds in Connecticut, New York and
New Jersey. There have been no human cases yet in Connecticut. The
only known human case in the region this year was a 78-year-old man
from Staten Island, N.Y., who is recovering.
</P>
<P>
   Most people who contract the disease experience flu-like
symptoms and never realize they have been exposed to the virus. The
virus can lead to a potentially fatal form of encephalitis, an
inflammation of the brain.
</P>
<P>
   Hadler and Rocque said the news of more positive results should
serve ''as a wake-up call'' to residents who should be taking
precautions.
</P>
<P>
   They urged the use of repellents to prevent mosquito bites and
said homeowners should eliminate potential breeding areas, such as
pools of stagnant water that gathers in buckets, catch basins,
gutters and other area around the home. Homeowners can buy the
larvae-killing pellets at home and treat mosquito breeding areas on
their own property.
</P>
<P>
   The state revived its mosquito control program more than four
years ago, when mosquitoes in Rhode Island tested positive for the
Eastern Equine Encephalitis virus. Since then, the DEP has spent
more than $3 million a year on the program.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm confident if we need more money, we'll be able to get
it,'' said Rocque.

<HEADLINE> Pesticide spray against West Nile Virus questioned  </HEADLINE>
By REAGAN HAYNES
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Some people fear preventive spraying against
the West Nile Virus is more threatening than the virus.
</P>
<P>
   ''No one has given their permission to be poisoned,'' said Anna
Niedzielski, an employee at Minnewaska State Park Preserve in
Ulster County.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the risk of spraying pesticides is greater than the
risk of getting West Nile Virus,'' said Hatti Langsford, the park
interpreter at the preserve.
</P>
<P>
   The state Department of Health said there is little known about
the cumulative effects of the pesticide sprays Malathion, Scourge
and Anvil that are being used statewide to counter mosquitos
carrying the potentially fatal virus.
</P>
<P>
   ''We did not say it was safe,'' state spokeswoman Kristine Smith
said. ''We said specifically, based on the current research, there
appear to be few health effects from these pesticides at the level
with which they are used.''
</P>
<P>
   The effects could include breathing problems, burning feelings
in eyes, nose and mouth.
</P>
<P>
   Tests on pregnant rats showed large amounts of Anvil and Scourge
affected the weight of both the mother and offspring, lowered the
weight of vital organs in offspring and showed some growing more
slowly than normal.
</P>
<P>
   Tests also showed pregnant rats and offspring exposed to low
levels of pesticides were unaffected, according to state health
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Testing of pesticides can take months and even years before the
federal Environmental Protection Agency approves its use, an EPA
spokeswoman said. Manufacturers are required to conduct long-term
health tests on laboratory animals, the results of which are then
reviewed by EPA scientists.
</P>
<P>
   ''Based on that information and the effectiveness (of the
pesticide), we decide whether to register the pesticide or not,''
said Nina Habib Spencer of the EPA's Region 2 office in New York
City. ''All of the ones being used (in New York) are registered
pesticides with the EPA.''
</P>
<P>
   Spencer cautioned that pesticides ''are toxic chemicals. They
are designed to kill things. In high doses, they can bring about
negative health affects in humans and other animals.
</P>
<P>
   ''Something we say around here quite often is, 'It's the dose
that makes the poison,''' Spencer said, adding that EPA regulates
the amount used by contractors.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers must use certified applicators and follow state
and federal regulations, according to Department of Environmental
Conservation officials.
</P>
<P>
   However, counties, rather than the state, decide whether to
spray and how often.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you don't have data it's harder to weigh the down side,''
Anthony Billittier, health commissioner of Erie County said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are dealing with scientific uncertainty in the face of a
scientific certainty,'' Smith said. ''West Nile can and will kill
human beings.''
</P>
<P>
   Anvil and Scourge, commonly selected by towns to spray, kill
adults then dissipate in about two hours according to health
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Neil Woodworth of the Adirondack Mountain Club said he is
concerned about how the pesticides breakdown in the environment.
</P>
<P>
   ''Often times, the manufacturer of a pesticide company will do
extensive testing on the pesticide itself, but they don't always do
tests on what they break down to,'' Woodworth said. ''What, if any,
testing has been done on what they break down to?''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said Scourge and Anvil ultimately breakdown into carbon
dioxide and water. She said studies show Malathion sometimes breaks
down into chemicals as toxic as the original form.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't recommend,'' Smith said. ''We support decisions made
on a local level.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the state doesn't perform tests, and that each county
has local factors to consider before spraying is ordered. Smith
said spraying should be a last resort. That, however, could change
as more information becomes available, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Anvil and Scourge are used to control fleas and ticks on pets.
They are also in human shampoos for lice control, according to
health officials.

<HEADLINE> 15 Vets on U.S. Olympic Soccer Team  </HEADLINE>
By JOSEPH WHITE
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) -- Despite a youth movement from a new coach,
the U.S. women's Olympic soccer team will look a lot like the team
that won the World Cup a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen of the 20 players from the World Cup squad, including
all of the regular starters, were chosen Thursday by coach April
Heinrichs to make up the 18-player roster that will represent the
United States next month at the Sydney Games.
</P>
<P>
   Heinrichs made the veterans nervous when she experimented with
younger lineups after she succeeded Tony DiCicco in January. It
quickly became apparent that five players from the World Cup team --
Tisha Venturini, Danielle Fotopoulos, Tiffany Roberts, Tracy Ducar
and Saskia Webber -- did not figure in Heinrichs' Olympic plans.
</P>
<P>
   But the mainstays are still there, from Mia Hamm to Brandi
Chastain to 34-year-old Michelle Akers, the oldest member of the
team. Akers, who had shoulder surgery in April and suffers from
chronic fatigue syndrome, has said this will be her last
international tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ''Actually I didn't think I was going to make it this year,''
said Akers, who wore a shoulder harness as she practiced with the
team Thursday. ''There were many times I thought 'There's too many
obstacles, too exhausting, too much pain.' Every time I hit the
wall something was there to help me over it and, one day at a time,
I made it.''
</P>
<P>
   Akers has played in 150 games for the U.S. national team,
appearing in three World Cups and the 1996 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Two other players recovering from injuries also made the cut.
Captain Carla Overbeck, who is also retiring from international
competition after the Olympics, had knee surgery in May, but it
held up well in Thursday's grueling practice. Goalkeeper Briana
Scurry was selected after a long battle with shin splints, but she
is now the backup to Siri Mullinix in the only major change to the
starting lineup from the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ''Having Michelle Akers and Carla Overbeck on this team was a
decision that I made in my mind two or three months ago because of
Carla's leadership,'' Heinrichs said.
</P>
<P>
   ''While Carla's knee might be at only 70 to 75 percent right
now, her will and power among these players, along with her
leadership, makes her the glue of this team. ... We all know that
Michelle one year ago helped this country win one of its most
impressive trophies ever. One year away from that she is still a
world class player, but she struggles with her shoulder. I think
what we will see over the next couple of weeks that she will get
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Heinrichs' eye on the future was reflected in three players who
weren't at the World Cup: Mullinix, 22, Nikki Serlenga, 22, and
Danielle Slaton, 20
</P>
<P>
   ''After the first week some players approached me and were a
little concerned about brining in these young players,'' Heinrichs
said. ''I told them if we had more than two-to-three younger
players, we've made too much of a change. I'm so proud of these
players who've hung in there, and clawed to hang around this team.
We weeded out the ones that aren't mentally ready yet, and we
weeded out the ones that aren't physically ready yet.''
</P>
<P>
   The team is training in Annapolis and will play there against
Russia in the first game of a three-game Olympic kickoff tour
Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Clippers Pick Gentry as Coach  </HEADLINE>
By BILL MARTINEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Los Angeles Clippers finally gave their
highly touted rookie class a leader.
</P>
<P>
   Alvin Gentry was introduced Thursday as coach of the franchise
loaded with young talent and burdened with a checkered history.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you look at what happened on draft night, I think there are
a lot of people who would like to be where I am,'' Gentry said.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers signed Gentry, 45, to a four-year deal and terms of
the contract were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   He had accepted a job as an assistant with the San Antonio Spurs
on June 16, and turned down a similar offer from the Atlanta Hawks
three days earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only thing distracting about this job is I've got suits
older than most of the players here,'' said Gentry, whose hiring
capped a busy week in which the Clippers signed first-round draft
picks Darius Miles, Keyon Dooling and Quentin Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is basically a college atmosphere,'' Gentry said, and
noted that rules will be the primary means of getting his message
to the players.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't want to treat these guys as babies,'' he said. ''We
have to make them understand that this is a job and there are
responsibilities that go with that.''
</P>
<P>
   He made no secret that the reconstituted team will be built
around Lamar Odom, the budding second-year star.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not afraid to tell the other guys that this is his team. I
look at him and I see the same talent as Grant Hill,'' said Gentry,
who coached the star forward in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Elgin Baylor, the Clippers' vice president of basketball
operations, said Gentry's attitude will be key through the season.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's important to get someone with the right
temperament to work with the players and improve them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gentry compiled an 88-93 record during parts of four seasons as
a head coach, most recently with Detroit, where he was 28-30 last
season and 73-72 overall before being fired on March 6.
</P>
<P>
   His first head coaching stint was with Miami, taking over in an
interim capacity in February 1995 and finishing that season with
record of 15-21.
</P>
<P>
   He also was an assistant with the Clippers during the 1990-91
season.
</P>
<P>
   Gentry's hiring fills a void left when the Clippers fired Chris
Ford in February and decided not to hire interim coach Jim Todd
after the team finished with an NBA-worst 15-67 record.
</P>
<P>
   Gentry steered away from commenting on the checkered past of the
franchise.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've got to be judged on what happens from this day
forward,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers thought they had a coach last week when they
offered University of Cincinnati coach Bob Huggins a reported
four-year deal worth $8 million.
</P>
<P>
   But Huggins turned it down, saying that he wanted to win a
national championship with the Bearcats.
</P>
<P>
   Center Michael Olowokandi expressed relief that the search was
over.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every team needs a coach, be it in off-season workouts or
during the season,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Mets 10, Astros 3  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL A. LUTZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- Mike Piazza, showing no sign of his knee injury,
went 4-for-4 and drove in four runs, and Robin Ventura also had
four RBIs as the New York Mets routed the Houston Astros 10-3
Thursday to complete a 5-2 road trip.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza, who mildly sprained his left knee Saturday, missed three
games because of of the injury, then homered and went 2-for-5
Wednesday in the Mets' 12-5 win.
</P>
<P>
   He had RBI singles in the first and fifth innings Thursday,
doubled in the third and hit a two-run single in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby J. Jones (7-5) won his third straight start, allowing two
runs and 10 hits in eight innings.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura went 2-for-5, including a two-run double in the
three-run seventh. Jay Payton homered and had an RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   New York closed within 2&AMP;frac12; games of NL East-leading Atlanta, the
closest the Mets have been to first place since July 2.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Bagwell homered twice, the 20th multihomer game of his
career and second this season. He is the first Houston player to
hit 30 homers in five consecutive seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Tony McKnight, a 23-year-old right-hander, lost in his major
league debut, allowing four runs -- three earned -- six hits and
three walks in six innings. He escaped a bases-loaded, two-outs jam
in the second when Hamilton hit a comebacker.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza's RBI single put the Mets ahead in the first, but
Bagwell's homer tied it in the bottom half. Ventura's grounder
scored Piazza in the third, but Bagwell homered again in the
fourth, his 31st of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza's fifth-inning single, which followed Benny Agbayani's
walk and Edgardo Alfonzo's single, put the Mets ahead for good and
Payton's homer made it 4-2 in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   New York, which outhit Houston 14-12, broke open the game in the
seventh against Joe Slusarski on Hamilton's leadoff triple, an
intentional walk to Piazza, Ventura's two-run double and Payton's
RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura added an RBI double in the eighth off Jay Powell.
</P>
<P>
   Raul Chavez doubled home a run in the ninth off Pat Mahomes.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Bagwell and Cincinnati's Ken Griffey Jr. are the only
active players with current streaks of five straight 30-homer,
100-run seasons. Bagwell's other multihomer game was July 1 against
St. Louis. ... Astros 2B Craig Biggio had surgery on his left knee
on Thursday to repair the anterior cruciate ligament. Biggio also
injured his medial collateral ligament but it is expected to heal
without surgery.

<HEADLINE> White House Battles Employee Porn  </HEADLINE>
By DEB RIECHMANN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- When White House officials punished a handful
of employees a year ago for downloading pornographic material from
the Internet, they thought they had snuffed out the problem. It has
resurfaced.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was a recent uptick in incidents of this in the last
month or so,'' White House spokesman Jake Siewert said Thursday.
''We're not certain who did it, but we're starting to sort it out
and those people will be punished too.''
</P>
<P>
   The Internet news site WorldNetDaily, which first reported the
story Wednesday, said a consultant hired last year to improve
security in the White House's computer network uncovered ''massive
pornographic video files passing through the system's Internet
firewall,'' which protects the system against hackers.
WorldNetDaily said the unidentified computer consultant from
California alerted officials to the cyber-porn problem in February
1999.
</P>
<P>
   ''A handful of White House employees were reprimanded and one
was suspended without pay a year ago for downloading pornographic
material from the Internet,'' Siewert said, insisting that the
problem was not ''massive'' as WorldNetDaily reported, but amounted
to ''isolated incidents.''
</P>
<P>
   He declined to provide details or say how many employees were
involved. In response to the problem, the White House enhanced
filters used to block access to inappropriate sites.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is clearly against White House policy,'' Siewert said.
''Every time you turn on a computer you're told to use the Internet
specifically for official government business only.''

<HEADLINE> Study: American children still poorer than two decades ago  </HEADLINE>
By VERENA DOBNIK
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - The poverty rate among American children has
decreased since it hit high levels in the early 1990s, and the
South is no longer the traditionally poor area it was in the past,
a study released Thursday shows.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the improvement, the poverty rate for children in
this country still is higher than it was about 20 years ago,
according to the report by the National Center for Children in
Poverty, a non-partisan research center at Columbia University.
</P>
<P>
   About 13.3 million children across the nation lived in poverty
in 1998, the most recent year for which data is available. They
represented almost 19 percent of the country's 71 million children.
</P>
<P>
   That compared to 16 percent of the nation's then 63 million
children living in poverty in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Still the rate has dropped in recent years since the poverty
rate among youngsters, after 1979, jumped to 22.5 percent in 1993,
an increase of almost 40 percent, according to the report, ''Child
Poverty in the States: Levels and Trends from 1979 to 1998.''
</P>
<P>
   The study analyzed annual income data from the U.S. Census
Bureau, with the poverty threshold for a family of four an annual
$16,600 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The long-term increase in child poverty has had an especially
strong impact in California, where the number of poor children grew
from just under 900,000 in 1979 to 2.15 million in 1998. One in six
poor American children now lives in California.
</P>
<P>
   The number of children in poverty increased by over 375,000 in
Texas, to about 1.2 million; by more than 200,000 in Arizona, to
360,542; and by over 200,000 in New York, to 1.1 million. In Ohio,
Georgia, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Minnesota, and Oregon, the number
rose by about 100,000 in each state to about half a million.
</P>
<P>
   A key finding was that poverty is less concentrated in the
South.
</P>
<P>
   Of the nine states that have reduced their child poverty rates
by one third or more since 1993, six are in the South, according to
the study.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, seven of nine states with poverty rates significantly
higher than the 16 percent national average were in the South.
Today only two of six southern states - Louisiana and West
Virginia- have a significantly higher poverty rate, with 29 percent
and about 27 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   ''The South is no longer the poverty zone that it was in 1979,''
said Neil Bennett, the center's senior adviser for demographic
research and analysis and one of the report's co-authors.
</P>
<P>
   Center director Larry Aber said: ''The progress in reducing
poverty in the South as well as in New Jersey and Illinois tells us
that this is not an intractable problem.''
</P>
<P>
   In New Jersey, child poverty fell by 37 percent to 241,000, and
in Illinois, by 32 percent to 473,000.

<HEADLINE> Man accused of drugging, raping girl over eight years  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LAKE LUZERNE, N.Y. (AP) - A man is accused of using an
ether-soaked sock to drug and rape a teen-age girl.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel B. Colson, 31, of Lake Luzerne was charged with
first-degree rape of the 15-year-old girl after Warren County
Sheriff's Department investigators questioned him Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Colson is accused of using an ether-soaked sock to cover the
girl's face and incapacitate her, before he raped her early Tuesday
morning, police said. Police said they were notified of the crime
Tuesday, after the girl was taken to the Glens Falls Hospital,
where she was treated and released.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Colson admitted raping the girl several times over a
period of eight years.
</P>
<P>
   Colson was arraigned Tuesday in Lake George and was sent to
Warren County Jail for lack of $50,000 cash bail or $100,000 bond.
</P>
<P>
   Lake Luzerne is 46 miles north of Albany.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- The San Jose Sharks re-signed restricted
free agent Niklas Sundstrom on Thursday, avoiding a salary
arbitration hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot, 195-pound right wing had 12 goals and 25 assists in
79 games last season with the Sharks. Sundstrom, who is six games
short of 400 for his career, also set a franchise record for
game-tying goals with three last season.
</P>
<P>
   The Sharks acquired Sundstrom from the Tampa Bay Lightning at
the start of last season. In his five-year career, he has 77 goals
and 123 assists.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing for the group II restricted free agent was scheduled
for Friday. Sundstrom filed for arbitration on July 17.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Thursday, the Sharks re-signed free agent left wing
Jarrett Deuling, who had 17 goals and 25 assists with the Kentucky
Thoroughblades of the American Hockey League last season, and free
agent defenseman Steve Bancroft, who split last season between the
Cincinnati Cyclones and the Houston Aeros of the International

<HEADLINE> Austin Leads Buick Open  </HEADLINE>
By DOUG FERGUSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND BLANC, Mich. (AP) -- For one day, Woody Austin discovered
what it's like to putt as well as Tiger Woods. The result was a
9-under-par 63 that left him stunned, and also leading after the
first round of the Buick Open.
</P>
<P>
   Austin, whose only PGA Tour victory came in the '95 Buick Open,
took only 22 putts and made 11 birdies on the pure greens of
Warwick Hills Country Club to take a two-stroke lead over Paul
Azinger.
</P>
<P>
   ''My game is pretty bad,'' Austin said. ''I needed some positive
input on my game, and this was very important.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods, in his first tournament since completing the Grand Slam,
three-putted twice -- once from 12 feet -- but still managed to walk
off the course with a 2-under 70.
</P>
<P>
   Masters champion Vijay Singh and Joe Ozaki were at 66. Hal
Sutton and Billy Mayfair were in the group at 67.
</P>
<P>
   For Woods, it was his 24th consecutive round at par or better,
dating to a 3-over 73 in the first round of the Byron Nelson
Classic in May.
</P>
<P>
   ''I broke 80, which is good for me,'' Woods joked.
</P>
<P>
   Golf has been a cruel joke for Austin, the PGA Tour rookie of
the year in '95 who has struggled to keep his card ever since his
two-year exemption from winning the Buick Open that year expired.
</P>
<P>
   His best television exposure occurred a couple of years ago when
he was caught banging the shaft of his putter against his forehead
in rapid succession. Small wonder. Austin has never finished higher
than 138th in putting.
</P>
<P>
   ''People don't know what it means to putt bad,'' he said. ''To
putt bad is to putt bad all the time. It sure would be nice one
year to be 80th -- that's still 70 spots better than I've been.''
</P>
<P>
   His strength his ball-striking, and he often wondered what it
would be like if the cup looked like a manhole instead of an ant
hole. He found out Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The 63 matched his lowest round on the PGA Tour, a stretch of
446 rounds dating to the first round of the '95 Buick Open.
</P>
<P>
   Starting his round on No. 10 in the afternoon, Austin birdied
the first five holes and kept his momentum with a 12-foot par save
out of the bunker. On his 15th hole, he sank a 25-footer for birdie
and the light came on.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's when I felt like I couldn't miss,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Azinger has fond memories of Warwick Hills. He has never won the
Buick Open, but this is where he made his return to the PGA Tour in
1994 after he was diagnosed with lymphoma.
</P>
<P>
   ''Welcome back to golf,'' the announcer said that day on the
first tee.
</P>
<P>
   Six years later, Azinger is slowly making his way back to the
days when he was a perennial winner on tour, which culminated with
his victory in the '93 PGA Championship. He finally won again this
year, a wire-to-wire victory in Honolulu, and would have contended
in the U.S. Open and British Open if Woods had taken those weeks
off.
</P>
<P>
   ''The hard thing for me was to play four years with no hope,''
Azinger said. ''That's all changed. I go to every tournament
thinking the way I used to think. I'm going to every tournament
with a lot of confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Confidence is never in short supply when the birdie putts are
essentially tap-ins, which is what Azinger had in his favor when
every birdie came inside about 8 feet -- and he made eagle by
chipping in from 35 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Loren Roberts and Casey Martin were among those at 68, while
Phil Mickelson was in a large group at 69. On a breezy, mostly
sunny day, 91 out of 155 players were at par or better.
</P>
<P>
   Woods has finished out of the top 20 only twice in his last 31
tournaments, both times in his first event after winning a major.
</P>
<P>
   The Buick Open seemed to be heading that direction as he played
for the first time since his record-setting performance in the
British Open. Despite a birdie-birdie start, Woods started showing
signs of rust and then came unraveled in the middle of his round.
</P>
<P>
   ''I did make a move,'' he said. ''Only it was the wrong way.''
</P>
<P>
   He pulled a 4-iron into the trees on the par-3 8th, leaving him
30 yards short of the green and blocked by a 25-foot oak tree. He
hit a flop shot over the tree, but 40 feet below the hole, and then
three-putted for double-bogey.
</P>
<P>
   Two holes later, he three-putted from 12 feet to make bogey,
lipping out from 18 inches. And while his tee shot on the par-3
11th hit the flag, he still missed the 8-footer for birdie, was 2
over and in danger of falling far behind.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger in trouble?
</P>
<P>
   Not so fast. He was pin-high on the 345-yard 12th, but left of
the green some 40 yards with a 30-foot pine right in his way. He
hit another flop shot onto the green, and again hit his putt too
hard. This one, however, hit the back of the cup and dropped for
birdie.
</P>
<P>
   He followed that with eagle putts on the next two holes -- a
two-putt from 35 feet on the par-5 13th, and a two-putt from 40
feet after hitting driver to the 322-yard 14th. Woods added another
birdie with a nice bunker shot on the par-5 16th.
</P>
<P>
   ''Granted, I was 2 over through 10,'' he said. ''But I thought,
'Just hang around a little bit and it will turn out all right.'''
</P>
<P>
   It turned out even better for Austin.

<HEADLINE> GOP:Commerce Should Have Census Say  </HEADLINE>
By GENARO C. ARMAS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The decision to release sampled census data
which could dramatically affect the way political district lines
are redrawn should remain with the Commerce Department secretary,
several Republicans have asserted.
</P>
<P>
   House GOP members led by Rep. Dan Miller of Florida, as well as
Michigan Gov. John Engler outlined their views in letters to the
Census Bureau. They wrote in response to a public comment period
over the Commerce proposal to delegate the decision-making to the
statistical agency.
</P>
<P>
   In general, Republicans oppose sampling, while Democrats and
Census director Kenneth Prewitt favor it. Prewitt believes the
proposal removes a layer of partisan influence from the
decision-making process.
</P>
<P>
   Sampling is a statistical method which supporters believe will
help account for parts of the population missed in prior counts,
including minorities, the poor and inner-city residents that
traditionally vote Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Some GOP leaders fear using sampled numbers could result in
reshaped congressional districts with more Democratic voters when
constitutionally mandated redistricting begins next year. They also
say the Census Bureau's sampling plan is statistically flawed.
</P>
<P>
   Commerce Secretary Norman Mineta supports giving the job to the
Census Bureau, Mineta spokesman Morrie Goodman said Thursday. ''It
should be the experts and professionals (at the Census Bureau) who
make that determination.''
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau is part of Commerce, which unveiled the
proposal in June. Goodman said Commerce hopes to make a final
decision by October.
</P>
<P>
   Seven of at least 23 letters received so far oppose it,
including ones from Miller, chairman of the House Government Reform
Committee's census panel and Engler, a fellow Republican.
Supporters include four former Census directors, including Barbara
Everitt Bryant, a Republican and head of the agency during the Bush
administration.
</P>
<P>
   ''The point, however, is that decision to vest this authority
lies with the Congress; and Congress has given final
decision-making authority exclusively to the Secretary, not the
Director of the Census Bureau,'' Miller's letter said. Five other
GOP members signed it, including Rep. Dan Burton of Indiana, the
government reform committee chairman, and Rep. Harold Rogers of
Kentucky, chairman of the House Appropriations subcommittee that
oversees Census funding.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our attorneys feel very confident that everything about the
delegation of authority is perfectly legal,'' Goodman said.
</P>
<P>
   Prewitt has said that if left up to him, his choice will be
based purely on what is best to do scientifically, not politically.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats say the Republican presidential nominee, Texas Gov.
George W. Bush, would have the power to reverse the decision should
he win the election.
</P>
<P>
   ''Republicans oppose getting an accurate count of America's
blacks, Hispanics and Asians and they will stop at nothing to
oppose it,'' said Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., ranking census
subcommittee member.
</P>
<P>
   In his letter, Engler said that the decision should take into
account opinions from nonpartisan statisticians outside the Census
Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   ''This deficiency in the proposed rule should cause the rule to
be rejected,'' Engler said.
</P>
<P>
   Nonsampled data, which will be used to reapportion congressional
seats, is due to President Clinton by Dec. 31. If approved, sampled
data would be released by next April.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court last year said the reapportionment of House
seats must be based on raw, non-sampled data. However, it left open
the option for states to use statistically adjusted numbers for
purposes of redrawing political boundaries.

<HEADLINE> Majoli, Lareau Gain Olympic Berths  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Former French Open champion Iva Majoli of Croatia and
Sebastien
Lareau of Canada have been given wild-card entries into the Sydney
Olympics.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Majoli, who won the French women's singles crown in 1997, will
play both singles and doubles, the International Tennis Federation
announced Thursday. In doubles, she will team with countrywoman
Silvija Talaja, who already had earned a singles berth in the games
because of her world ranking.
</P>
<P>
   Lareau, Canada's top-ranked player, was given a spot in men's
singles.
</P>
<P>
   The wild cards are chosen on the basis of international computer
rankings and geographic diversity. Under rules for Olympic tennis,
there are 14 ITF wild-card places in both the men's and women's
singles, plus two wild-card places chosen by a committee made up of
the International Olympic Committee, the national Olympic
committees and the ITF.
</P>
<P>
   However, eight of the ITF places in the men's singles were
awarded directly using the ATP Entry System ranking of July 10 as
part of the agreement between the ITF and the ATP Tour.
</P>
<P>
   In both men's and women's doubles, there are eight ITF wild-card
places. Some of the doubles players had already qualified for
singles, such as Goran Ivanisevic of Croatia, Andre Medvedev of
Ukraine and Nicolas Lapentti of Ecuador.
</P>
<P>
   ''One of the aims of the ITF was to strike a balance between top
quality competitors and the desire to have a more international
field at the Olympic tennis event,'' said ITF president Francesco
Ricci Bitti. ''We ... are particularly pleased we have been able to
give wild cards to a number of top young players who are the future
of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Slovenia's Tina Pisnik replaced Poland's Magdalena Grzybowska as
a direct acceptance in the women's singles after Grzybowska
withdrew.
</P>
<P>
   The addition of the wild cards brings the number of countries
taking part in Olympic tennis to 53.

<HEADLINE> AmericaOne Sells Boats to Oracle  </HEADLINE>
By HOWARD ULMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   The America's Cup no longer is a rich man's game. It's a contest
for the super rich.
</P>
<P>
   With four billionaires lined up to participate, skipper Paul
Cayard decided to sell the best U.S. entry in this year's
competition when he realized he couldn't raise enough money to be
competitive.
</P>
<P>
   So he announced Thursday that he sold AmericaOne, loser in the
Cup semifinals in New Zealand last February, and another yacht, to
Larry Ellison, chief executive officer of software giant Oracle,
based in the San Francisco area. No price was disclosed, although
Cayard said, ''it's a fair deal for both sides.''
</P>
<P>
   But not entirely satisfying.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's tough,'' said Cayard, who has participated in five
America's Cup campaigns. ''AmericaOne is our child, in a sense. But
one also has to be realistic.''
</P>
<P>
   After months of fund-raising efforts and analysis, he decided
the most he was likely to come up with was about $30 million.
During that period, he was contacted by Ellison's representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Cayard concluded that there were likely to be four $80 million
campaigns for the Cup that will be defended by New Zealand in
Auckland in 2002-03.
</P>
<P>
   ''Beating one guy who had $80 million might be possible,'' he
said in a conference call, ''but with four of them, the odds were
severely diminished.''
</P>
<P>
   Cayard said he wants to remain active in the Cup but doesn't
know what role, if any, he'll have with Ellison.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some days I wake up and say, 'It's a lot of hard work to be
the best skipper in the world and I want to spend more time with my
kids and my family,''' he said. ''Other days I wake up and lift
more weights than I ever lifted and say, 'I'm only 41 years old. I
can still do it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Five American syndicates were among 11 challengers to face
defending champion New Zealand this year. They were whittled down
to Prada of Italy and America One, representing the St. Francis
Yacht Club in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Cayard's boat led their best-of-nine series 4-3, then Prada won
the last two races. It was the first time since Cup competition
began in 1851 that the United States didn't reach the finals.
</P>
<P>
   Prada got there, but was whitewashed 5-0 by New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
   Patrizio Bertelli, head of the Prada syndicate, is expected to
mount one of the big-bucks campaigns next time. So is Ellison.
</P>
<P>
   Swiss billionaire Ernesto Bertarelli has lured away skipper
Russell Coutts, tactician Brad Butterworth and others from New
Zealand's team that won 10 straight finals races dating to a sweep
of Dennis Conner off San Diego in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Telecommunications executive Craig McCaw reportedly is behind a
Seattle syndicate that has hired Laurie Davidson, a principal
designer of Team New Zealand's winning boats in 1995 and 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Yacht Club may not have billionaire backing but is
teaming up with four-time Cup winner Dennis Conner to launch
another challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Cayard insisted throughout the last competition that the
American effort was diluted with five syndicates. He said he
expects three to compete next time for the right to face New
Zealand in the finals.
</P>
<P>
   ''We did not put our best foot forward last time,'' he said.
''If you don't have the wherewithal that Ellison and McCaw have, I
find it unlikely that they will go very far.
</P>
<P>
   ''I really feel that we have worked toward the better American
solution in our decision to take reality into account and not be
bullheaded about staying on our course.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellison ''did some sailing in the '70s,'' said Bill Erkelens,
project manager for Sayonara, Ellison's maxiboat. ''His sailing
career really has flourished in the last five years.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellison won the storm-tossed Sydney-to-Hobart race off Australia
for the second time in December 1998 aboard Sayonara. The race was
marred by the deaths of six sailors.
</P>
<P>
   Now he's prepared to enter the most prestigious sailing arena,
joining such wealthy America's Cup competitors of the first four
decades of the 1900s as Cornelius Vanderbilt, Sir Thomas Lipton and
Sir T.O.M. Sopwith.
</P>
<P>
   ''In those days, they were industrialists'' who participated,
Cayard said. ''Nowadays, you have the kings of high tech who have
the capability to play this game.''

<HEADLINE> Judge may face discipline over altercations with former boyfriend  </HEADLINE>
By KATHLEEN CANNON
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Superior Court Judge Rosemarie Williams
traded in her judicial robes Thursday for a seat at the defense
table.
</P>
<P>
   The seven-year judge is defending herself against charges she
engaged in heated public altercations with her former boyfriend, a
Mercer County sheriff's officer.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, 48, a civil court judge who was transferred from
Mercer County to the Somerset County Courthouse, faces a penalty
ranging from reprimand to removal at the conclusion of the hearing
before the Supreme Court Advisory Committee on Judicial Conduct.
</P>
<P>
   The panel, headed by retired Supreme Court Associate Justice
Alan Handler, heard a full day of testimony Thursday and will
continue the hearing Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Williams has alleged in court papers that she was a victim of an
abusive relationship with former boyfriend Alfred ''Wes'' Bridges
Jr., 27. She broke into tears Thursday when Bridges denied hitting,
threatening her or pointing a gun at her during their affair.
</P>
<P>
   But he later admitted under cross-examination that he may have
injured her in an April 1999 incident.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's possible that I caused one of those injuries,'' he said
after listening to a medical report of Williams' cuts and bruises
read by her defense attorney.
</P>
<P>
   However, the case now before the judicial watchdog panel deals
with an incident that occurred one year later.
</P>
<P>
   It comes down to the word of two-thirds of the lovers triangle:
Bridges, a tall, athletically built former Rutgers University
gridiron star and son of a prominent Ewing Township politician, and
his date the night of April 14, Tami DeVitas of Princeton.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few weeks before the date, Bridges testified he broke up
with Williams following a year and a half romance. They became
involved after he provided security in her courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   The night of the date, Williams first confronted the couple at a
restaurant in Ewing, Bridges and DeVitas both testified.
</P>
<P>
   The judge was in a ''very angry upset way. I was just looking
for an easy way out,'' said Bridges, who said that Williams pulled
and stretched his shirt during their heated talk about the other
woman.
</P>
<P>
   DeVitas said Williams was ''loud and boisterous,'' using profane
language to ask her if she was having sex with Bridges.
</P>
<P>
   Williams then followed the couple to another bar, where she
continued to harangue them, they both testified. Police were
called, but took more than a half hour to respond, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Bridges testified Williams attacked him again, this
time tearing his shirt completely. He brought the shirt into court
Thursday, a navy blue T-shirt with torn and fraying sleeves.
</P>
<P>
   DeVitas testified that at the second bar, Williams used a vulgar
term to describe her, testimony that was not collaborated by
Bridges.
</P>
<P>
   But Williams' defense attorney pointed out inconsistencies
between DeVitas' testimony and her earlier statements to police and
committee investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Handler on Monday is expected to rule on the admissibility of
tape recordings Bridges made of conversations with Williams and
messages she left on his voice mail, starting in July 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, the retired justice would not allow him to testify
about the specific contents of the tapes. Bridges said only in
court that they document threats Williams made against him.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought I had to protect myself. I had received threats from
Williams about various things. If it came down to my word against
hers, I knew I'd be in trouble,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Agent: Grant to Miami Deal Not Done  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- A sign-and-trade deal that would send free agent
power forward Brian Grant to the Miami Heat has not been completed,
the player's agent said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sign-and-trades are difficult,'' agent Mark Bartlestein said.
''There's no deals done as of yet, nothing is completed. We're
obviously talking with Miami.''
</P>
<P>
   The Palm Beach Post, however, in a story for Friday's editions,
reported that an agreement in principle was reached among the
Portland Trail Blazers, Cleveland Cavaliers and the Heat for the
three-way deal.
</P>
<P>
   Portland plans to sign Grant to long-term deal, which will pay
him as much as $9.2 million next season and $87 million over seven
years, and then send him to Miami. Cavaliers forward Shawn Kemp
will go to Portland. Cleveland will get forwards Clarence
Weatherspoon and Chris Gatling from Miami and Portland will throw
in Gary Grant, after signing him to a three-year contract, the
newspaper reported, citing anonymous NBA sources.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously there's a lot of interest on both sides,'' Heat
general manager Randy Pfund said. ''We've inched a lot closer, but
because of the timing, the situation cannot be resolved right
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Gatling's inclusion in the deal would mean the trade could not
be declared official until at least Aug. 26. The Heat obtained
Gatling from Denver in June and league rules do not allow a player
to be traded twice within 60 days.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Grant almost ended up in Cleveland in a $93 million deal
that would have sent him to the Cavaliers in exchange for Kemp. But
as a free agent, Grant used his power to turn down the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Then, after opting to become a free agent at the end of June and
giving up a guaranteed $40 million over the next four years, Grant
this week reportedly turned down a $70 million, six-year offer to
stay with the Blazers.

<HEADLINE> British Protest Pedophiles  </HEADLINE>
By JILL LAWLESS
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- The placards on the baby buggies at daily protests
were unambiguous. ''Kill the pedophiles,'' read one over the head
of a chubby toddler. ''Don't house them, hang them,'' said another.
</P>
<P>
   Britain has been obsessed with pedophiles this summer, ever
since the naked body of 8-year-old Sarah Payne was discovered in a
field in southern England two weeks after she disappeared while out
playing -- and a tabloid newspaper started printing pictures of sex
offenders.
</P>
<P>
   In the coastal city of Portsmouth, demonstrators marched every
night for a week in an effort to drive out convicted or suspected
sex offenders, before agreeing Thursday to suspend their campaign
and meet with local officials to seek a solution.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrators say they have a list of 15 to 20 people they
want removed, compiled from sources including police radio
transmissions, the Internet and word of mouth. One man was
reportedly suspected because he lived alone and talked about how
much he loved his mother.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want them out of the area and we won't rest until they're
gone,'' said Barry Pettinger, a father of three. ''Where they go is
not our problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The protesters in Portsmouth, 70 miles southwest of London, say
they are fighting for their children's safety. Police, religious
leaders and other critics say the protests create a climate of fear
and hysteria that will only drive sex offenders underground and
place children in more danger.
</P>
<P>
   Police say five innocent families have been driven from the
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ''A number of families who have nothing whatsoever to do with
pedophiles or sex offenders have moved because they do not like
what is going on,'' said Hampshire Police spokesman Richard
Horobin.
</P>
<P>
   The protests follow a campaign by the News of the World, a
mass-market Sunday tabloid newspaper usually better known for its
stories about the sex lives of celebrities. For two weeks the
newspaper published names, photos, identifying details and
locations of alleged pedophiles.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign was followed by a series of vigilante attacks on
people identified in the newspaper and on innocent people mistaken
for them.
</P>
<P>
   Last week in Portsmouth, a police officer was injured and a car
set ablaze when 150 people rioted outside the home of an alleged
sex offender. The local member of Parliament, Syd Rapson, said he
had received death threats after expressing doubts about the
protests.
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, several people who shared surnames with
alleged offenders named by the News of the World were attacked by
vigilante gangs.
</P>
<P>
   Police say two recent suicides may be linked to the newspaper
campaign. A grandfather from the Manchester area who took an
overdose of pills on Saturday fled his home two weeks earlier after
a vigilante attack.
</P>
<P>
   A wealthy motorcycle dealer under investigation for allegedly
molesting teen-age boys was found dead at his home in southern
England on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The News of the World has a lot to answer for,'' Richard
Harries, the bishop of Oxford, told The Guardian newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've only got to remember examples like the witches of Salem,
where communities got caught up in communal hysteria.''
</P>
<P>
   Robin Corbett, chairman of a House of Commons committee on home
affairs, on Wednesday asked the government to consider prosecuting
the News of the World for inciting public disorder.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was perfectly predictable when the News of the World
started this what the outcome would be, and I suspect they knew it
as well,'' Corbett told the British Broadcasting Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper insists that it does not condone vigilante action.
</P>
<P>
   It has called for legislation that would allow residents to know
if a convicted sex offender moved into their neighborhood. Named
''Sarah's Law'' in memory of Sarah Payne, it is modeled on
''Megan's Law,'' the U.S. legislation named for Megan Kanka, the
New Jersey child who was raped and murdered by a repeat sex
offender.
</P>
<P>
   The paper says 350,000 people have signed its petition for the
legislation, which has received the backing of police and
child-welfare groups.
</P>
<P>
   The government introduced a national register of sex offenders
in 1997, but it is available only to police and probation officers.
</P>
<P>
   Officials have resisted the calls to make the register public,
but on Thursday Home Office Minister Barbara Roche announced a
review.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will meet with everybody concerned,'' she said. ''But we
need to be able to do that in a period of calm and quiet
discussion.''

<HEADLINE> Organ Network Proposes New System  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's organ transplant network proposed
Thursday a more sophisticated system of ranking patients waiting
for new livers.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal is meant to better target livers by using more
specific medical criteria to place waiting patients along a
continuum. The current system groups patients into more static
categories.
</P>
<P>
   The United Network for Organ Sharing, which runs the national
transplant system, plans to put the plan out for public comment
next week, and finalize it by its November meeting.
</P>
<P>
   It also plans a public session in September to discuss the plan.
</P>
<P>
   It's part of the network's effort to comply with a controversial
Health and Human Services directive to get more livers to the
sickest patients.
</P>
<P>
   But the network has not yet published a corollary proposal that
goes to the heart of the issue: wider sharing of organs over
geographic areas.
</P>
<P>
   Under the current system, patients in certain parts of the
country get transplants much quicker than those in other areas,
partly because donated livers are distributed to local patients
first, even if there is someone sicker in a neighboring community
or region.
</P>
<P>
   HHS wants to break down those barriers, which often are
artificially drawn.
</P>
<P>
   The second piece of the liver plan will be unveiled after public
comments are collected on the first part, said Joel Newman, a
network spokesman.

<HEADLINE> Barry Signs Deal With Kings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Free agent guard Jon Barry re-signed
with the Sacramento Kings on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings said Barry, the 31-year-old son of former NBA star
Rick Barry, signed a multiyear contract, but would not disclose
details of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Barry, who originally signed with the Kings as a free agent in
1999, averaged a career-high 8.0 points last season, finishing
ninth in the NBA in 3-point field goals.
</P>
<P>
   ''Jon's a veteran who is an outstanding outside shooter,'' said
Geoff Petrie, the Kings' vice president of basketball operations.
''He provides us with a tremendous amount of energy when he's out
there on the floor. He's one of the most productive players off the
bench in the entire league last season.''

<HEADLINE> Astros Second Baseman Has Surgery  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- Houston Astros second baseman Craig Biggio had
surgery Thursday to repair the anterior cruciate ligament on his
left knee Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Biggio was hurt Aug. 1 when Florida's Preston Wilson slid into
second base and caught Biggio's leg, tearing ligaments in Biggio's
left knee. It was Biggio's first major injury in 13 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The medial collateral ligament also was injured but doctors
expect that to heal without surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Biggio will wear a knee brace for six weeks and can start
jogging in about three months. Astros general manager Gerry
Hunsicker said he was optimistic Biggio will be ready for spring
training in February.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of his injury, Biggio was hitting .268, his lowest
average since 1989, when he was still a catcher. He has eight home
runs and 35 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Biggio played at least 160 games in every season since 1996 and
appeared in all 162 games three times in his career.

<HEADLINE> D'Alessio Leads LPGA du Maurier  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO
<TEXT>
<P>
   AYLMER, Quebec (AP) -- LPGA Tour rookie Diana D'Alessio needed
only 23 putts Thursday in a 5-under-par 67 that gave her the
first-round lead in the du Maurier Classic, the final major of the
year in women's golf.
</P>
<P>
   D'Alessio's career-best round gave her a two-stroke lead over Se
Ri Pak, Annika Sorenstam, Kristi Albers, Marisa Baena and Tracy
Hanson.
</P>
<P>
   Karrie Webb, seeking to become the first golfer since 1986 to
win three majors in one year, shot a 71 at the 6,403-yard Royal
Ottawa Golf Club.
</P>
<P>
   D'Alessio missed the cut in four of the 12 tour events she has
played this year. Her $43,693 in winnings was thanks mainly to the
$31,072 she won for finishing fourth in the Hawaiian Ladies Open in
February. She has made only $5,094 since April.
</P>
<P>
   But the 25-year-old native of Dover, N.J., said her ''lull''
from playing on Saturdays and Sundays has been mainly due to a
mental battle over maintaining self-confidence throughout an entire
round rather than hitting the ball poorly.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, she said she stepped on every tee ''knowing that I
could make birdie.''
</P>
<P>
   Starting on the back nine in one of the first threesomes off the
tee in the morning, D'Alessio made birdie putts of 15 feet on No.
10, 40 feet on No. 11 and 2 feet on No. 14 to start the day at the
top of the leaderboard.
</P>
<P>
   An errant drive on 15 cost her a stroke, but she made a 4-footer
for birdie on No. 1, chipped in from about 25 feet on No. 2 and
made a 36-foot putt for another birdie on No. 5. After making a
bogey from the sand on the par-3 8th, D'Alessio closed out her
round with a two-putt birdie on the short par-5 9th.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everything went my way today,'' she said. ''I made a lot of
putts. I've never had 23 putts before in my life. That's my
career-low putting for a day.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who played in the afternoon had to contend with winds and,
because of a nearly two-hour rain delay, soggy fairways and
unpredictable greens.
</P>
<P>
   Sorenstam, tied with Webb for most tour wins this year with
five, hasn't won a major since the 1996 U.S. Open and has often
played herself out of contention in the first rounds of those
events. Not so Thursday, with a solid five-birdie, two-bogey round
which would have been even better if she had converted birdie
opportunities on 16, 17 and 18 after the rain delay.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a great first round,'' Sorenstam said. ''It's the best
first round I've had in a major in a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Albers, who is struggling with a bad back, said she stretched
and ''did everything that I possibly could during the delay to stay
warm'' except hit balls. Once play resumed, she had two birdies.
</P>
<P>
   Baena, a Colombia native in her second year on the tour, would
have had second place to herself except for a bogey on 18.
</P>
<P>
   Pak made four birdie putts under 10 feet and had one bogey, but
said she spent most of her round scrambling for pars or trying to
stay out of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't have any kind of big problem today,'' said Pak, who is
trying to win her third career major and first since the 1998 U.S.
Women's Open. ''It's just OK, but it's the consistency. That's why
I have a lot of up-and-down.''
</P>
<P>
   Webb would claim a $1 million bonus for winning the du Maurier
and becoming the first women's golfer since Pat Bradley 14 years
ago to win three majors in one year. She previously won the Nabisco
Championship and the U.S. Women's Open.
</P>
<P>
   Juli Inkster, who won the year's other major at the LPGA
Championship, shot an even-par 72 Thursday. Prince Edward Island
native Lorie Kane, Canada's best hope in the only tour event played
on Canadian soil, also shot 72.
</P>
<P>
Divots@: Either Inkster or Webb have won the last six majors dating
to the 1999 LPGA Championship. ... Martha Nause, the 1994 du
Maurier champion, withdrew because of back spasms. ... Emilee Klein
withdrew with the flu, clearing a spot in the field for Oh-Yeon
Kwon. But Kwon lasted only five holes before withdrawing with a
recurring wrist injury.

<HEADLINE> Dom DiMaggio Disgusted by Article  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Dom DiMaggio is angry with Vanity
Fair's story on his brother, Joe, which was based on interviews
with Morris Engelberg, the lawyer for the late Hall of Famer.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe it's a sick monologue of utterances delivered by a
person that appears to have a very serious problem,'' Dom DiMaggio
said Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mr. Engelberg professes a great love, affection and a very
close friendship with and for Joe, then proceeds to destroy the
privacy Joe so zealously guarded when Joe is no longer available to
defend himself. I think it's disgusting.''
</P>
<P>
   Engelberg, who was at the Yankee outfielder's bedside when he
died, recalled DiMaggio's last words in the Vanity Fair story.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'll finally get to see Marilyn,'' DiMaggio whispered,
according to Engelberg.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Daily News reported a hospice worker said DiMaggio
had no last words.
</P>
<P>
   ''Of course, there were, and that's what Joe told me,''
Engelberg said.
</P>
<P>
   The article is featured in the September issue. DiMaggio died of
lung cancer in March 1999 at 84.
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio is pictured as a brooding, parsimonious loner who held
grudges and demanded strict adherence to rules.
</P>
<P>
   Engelberg said one reason he granted the interview to Vanity
Fair was to dispel stories that he made money from the deals he
arranged for DiMaggio.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason, Engelberg said earlier this week was to
perpetuate DiMaggio's name among a new generation of fans.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't want Joe to become another Lou Gehrig. None of today's
kids knows who Lou Gehrig was,'' Engelberg said. ''I want Joe
DiMaggio to become another Babe Ruth when it comes to
recognition.''
</P>
<P>
   Engelberg said for the same reason he hopes to write a book
about DiMaggio. He said he has taped material for about 350 pages.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if Joe DiMaggio's name has been sullied recently, Dom
DiMaggio said, ''Yes I do.''
</P>
<P>
   Dom DiMaggio was in St. Petersburg for the Tampa Bay Devil Rays'
weekend celebration of the 100th anniversary of the American
League.

<HEADLINE> Mayor faces $54 million sexual harassment lawsuit  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   UTICA, N.Y. (AP) - Four male city employees filed federal
lawsuits Thursday charging former Mayor Edward A. Hanna with sexual
harassment and seeking a total of $54 million in damages.
</P>
<P>
   In the suits, one current employee and three former city
employees claim Hanna made ''unwelcome sexual advances'' and used
his authority to pressure them to perform sex acts with him or with
others while he watched. Hanna conditioned their jobs or pay on
their response, the suits claim.
</P>
<P>
   The 78-year-old Hanna, who resigned July 3 citing health
concerns, has denied the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hanna has stated from the beginning that these are outrageous
lies and fabrications,'' his lawyer, Louis T. Brindisi told the
Observer-Dispatch of Utica. ''He's been approached to settle the
case, but he refused to do so, because he believes these
allegations are lies and ... that he will be vindicated in court.''
</P>
<P>
   Utica lawyer Frank Policelli, who represents the four
plaintiffs, said Hanna was ready to settle but the city balked.
</P>
<P>
   ''I saw Hanna's check for his part of the deal,'' he said. ''It
was the city who didn't want to come up with their end of the
deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanna could not be reached Thursday. Mayor Tim Julian and
Assistant Corporation Counsel Charles Brown declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   In the lawsuits, Joseph DiPierro, Joseph Pouliot and Patrick Van
Etten each ask for $14 million in damages plus lawyers fees.
Current city employee Nathan Newman asks for $12 million, plus
fees.
</P>
<P>
   Among the allegations, the plaintiffs claim that in February
1999, Hanna watched a pornographic movie at his house with Pouliot
and another male city employee, then ordered both employees ''to
take their clothes off and get into the bed. (Hanna) then exposed
himself and began masturbating as he directed the two to engage in
sexual activity,'' the suit says.
</P>
<P>
   The suit also claims Hanna told Newman of a possible sexual
harassment lawsuit against him and said he would have investigators
make up stories about Newman if the employee didn't change his
story.

<HEADLINE> Thompson Wins 100-M Breaststroke  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL NEWBERRY
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Jenny Thompson and Dara Torres flapped
toward the finish line with almost perfect synchronization, two of
America's greatest swimmers chasing another taste of Olympic glory.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson reached the wall a split-second before Torres to win a
stirring 100-meter breaststroke at the U.S. trials Thursday night.
But Torres was a winner, too, becoming the first American swimmer
to qualify for four Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, a five-time gold medalist, shook off memories of a
poor performance at the 1996 trials to earn her third trip to the
Olympics in 57.78 seconds. Torres, swimming right beside Thompson,
was virtually stroke-for-stroke over the final 25 meters, falling
just short in 57.86.
</P>
<P>
   No one else was within a second of these two giants of the
sport.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Moses, who gave up swimming for six years after burning out
at age 10, showed why he's one of the favorites for gold in the
men's 100 breaststroke. He set an American record of 1:00.44 -- just
0.08 seconds off the world mark held by Russia's Roman Sloudnov.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Calhoun of Auburn, Ala., claimed the other Olympic berth at
1:01.09.
</P>
<P>
   The 33-year-old Torres, who returned to swimming last year after
a seven-year retirement spent dabbling in modeling and infomercial
work, held a slight lead at the turn. Thompson caught up on the
return trip and touched first at the end.
</P>
<P>
   Both swimmers finished short of Torres' American record of
57.58, set a day earlier in the preliminaries. And both have a lot
of work to do before Sydney, where Dutch sensation Inge de Bruijn
has set a very high bar to catch with a world record of 56.64.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it was a remarkable accomplishment by Torres, who swam in
the Los Angeles Games 16 years ago and also competed at Seoul and
Barcelona before leaving the sport with two gold medals, a silver
and a bronze.
</P>
<P>
   When Torres decided to begin competing again in July 1999, she
called Thompson her inspiration. They worked out together until the
practice pool began to resemble a mini-Olympics, forcing coach
Richard Quick to split them up.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, 27, has won five gold medals in her career -- but all
have come in relays. Her only individual medal is a silver in 1992,
and she failed to qualify in any of her individual events at the
1996 trials.
</P>
<P>
   Now, she can go for a gold medal all her own.
</P>
<P>
   In the morning preliminaries, 16-year-old Megan Quann broke her
own American record in the 100-meter breaststroke at 1:07.12.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not satisfied,'' said Quann, who eclipsed the mark of
1:07.54 set in March. ''I want to break the world record and I know
I can do it.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't happen in the evening semifinals, but she still
qualified for Friday's final in 1:07.66. Even her better time was
0.60 seconds off the world record held by South Africa's Penny
Heyns -- a significant difference to make up as she headed into the
evening semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   ''Because the world record is such a low time, people think it's
untouchable,'' she said. ''I don't feel that way. I have a goal, to
break that record, and I believe I can get it.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe she could learn a thing or two from Lenny
Krayzelburg, world record-holder in the men's 100 backstroke. The
24-year-old native of the Ukraine cruised through the prelims at
54.33, fastest in the world this year.
</P>
<P>
   But he was just getting warmed up. Krayzelburg wore a
traditional suit -- forgoing the high-tech bodysuit -- and didn't
even bother with a skin cap. Heck, he probably could have reached
the semifinals swimming in a suit and tie.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can come in and work on some things and build my race,'' he
said. ''I'm saving it for (the final) tomorrow night.''
</P>
<P>
   Another highly anticipated race was on the Thursday night
schedule. In the men's 400 individual medley, Tom Wilkens
challenged the dominance of Tom Dolan, world record-holder and
defending Olympic champion.
</P>
<P>
   Brooke Bennett, the 1996 gold medalist in the 800 freestyle,
took it easy in the prelims of the 400 free and still finished at
4:08.87 -- more than two seconds ahead of the next-fastest
qualifier, Diana Munz.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was the easiest 4:08 I ever swam in my life,'' said
Bennett, sounding confident heading into the evening final.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett still has unfinished business from the 1996 trials, when
she failed to qualify in the 400 -- her best event. She wants to
make up for it in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm using all my experience from '96,'' Bennett said. ''I can
really feel the wisdom I've learned over four years.''

<HEADLINE> Ex-Dem Fund-Raiser Seeks New Trial  </HEADLINE>
By GREG TOPPO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A former Democratic fund-raiser convicted of
arranging illegal contributions to the 1996 Clinton-Gore campaign
asked a federal judge to grant her a new trial Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for Maria Hsia told U.S. District Court Judge Paul
Freedman that Hsia conviction in March on charges she arranged more
than $100,000 in illegal contributions to President Clinton, Vice
President Al Gore and other Democrats in 1996, should be set aside,
along with her indictment.
</P>
<P>
   Hsia, a Taiwan native who began raising money for Gore more than
a decade ago, was convicted in U.S. District Court on five felony
counts of causing false statements to be filed with the Federal
Election Commission. Each charge carries a five-year maximum prison
term.
</P>
<P>
   In a hearing Thursday, Nancy Luque, an attorney for Hsia, said
the jury heard misleading and confusing evidence from prosecutors.
Luque said Hsia's alleged wrongdoing in the case was based on
''extremely weak to nonexistent evidence,'' and said publicity
surrounding the trial tainted the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   She also asked the judge to disqualify Justice Department
lawyers from the case for presenting what she called ''prejudicial,
horrible slime evidence'' pointing to Hsia, even though Luque said
her client had no knowledge of the nature of the donations.
</P>
<P>
   Luque said none of the checks alleged as illegal contributions
indicated that the money ''was to be used in a federal election,''
and none mentioned a candidate to whom the money should go.
</P>
<P>
   Friedman, a Clinton appointee, did not immediately say when he
would rule on the requests.
</P>
<P>
   During her trial, prosecutors alleged that Hsia, an immigration
consultant from Los Angeles, tapped a Buddhist temple and a few of
her well-to-do business clients for money to reimburse straw donors
listed as the contributors on federal election reports. Prosecutors
said a total of $109,000 in reimbursed donations went to
Clinton-Gore '96, the Democratic Party and the campaign of Rep.
Patrick Kennedy, D-R.I.
</P>
<P>
   Among the evidence was video footage of the vice president
attending a now-infamous donor event on April 29, 1996, at a
Buddhist temple in Hacienda Heights, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Gore later said he hadn't known he was attending a fund-raiser.
After documents turned up referring to the event in advance as a
fund-raiser, Gore modified his characterization, saying he had
thought it was a finance-related event.
</P>
<P>
   At the trial, former Democratic Party fund-raiser John Huang,
the central figure in the campaign fund-raising scandal, testified
that Hsia handed him an envelope containing $100,000 the day after
Gore attended the temple event.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the donations in the envelope were later reimbursed by
the temple. Prosecutors said Hsia helped arrange $65,000 in illegal
reimbursements to donors, using temple funds.
</P>
<P>
   Hsia's lawyers said there was no evidence that Hsia was aware of
the reimbursements, but prosecutors introduced canceled checks
suggesting that on three instances, from 1993 to 1996, Hsia used
temple funds to reimburse her own political donations.
</P>
<P>
   Her lawyers said the money was for public relations work Hsia
had done for the temple.

<HEADLINE> Gordon Spivack, formal federal prosecutor, antitrust attorney, dies at 71 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) - Gordon Spivack, a prominent antitrust
lawyer and former U.S. Justice Department official, has died. He
was 71.
</P>
<P>
   Spivack died of colon cancer on Sunday at his home in New Haven.
</P>
<P>
   He was a senior partner in the New York City law firm of Coudert
Brothers from 1986 until his death. His clients included some of
the country's biggest firms, including Union Carbide, Chevron,
Cargill and Coca-Cola Co. For decades he defended the soft drink
company's oft-challenged relationship with bottlers and
distributors.
</P>
<P>
   Following his 1955 graduation from Yale Law School, Spivack
joined the Justice Department's antitrust division. He was the
government's lead lawyer in a price-fixing lawsuit against General
Electric and Westinghouse. He became the department's director of
operations and oversaw 350 trial lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   In 1967, the New Haven native returned to Yale to teach
antitrust law and civil procedure.
</P>
<P>
   ''Antitrust was in his blood,'' said Stephen Hudspeth, a former
student who now heads up the litigation department at Coudert
Brothers. ''He lived the antitrust law and believed it was a
cornerstone of our democratic polity and of our economic freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Dolores, a brother, two sons and two
grandchildren.

<HEADLINE> Spain Protesters Detain Politician  </HEADLINE>
By DANIEL WOOLLS
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADRID, Spain (AP) -- Protesters screamed ''murderers'' at
politicians linked to the Basque separatist group ETA Thursday
during a vigil in Pamplona against a wave of attacks this week that
has killed five people and injured 11.
</P>
<P>
   One of the politicians was thrown to the ground and detained in
a scuffle with police, television images showed.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of people had gathered outside Pamplona's town hall to
observe five minutes of silence as part of a second straight day of
nationwide protests against a seemingly relentless wave of attacks
blamed on ETA.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, an army officer stationed in Pamplona,
2nd-lieutenant Francisco Casanova, 47, was shot in the head and
killed.
</P>
<P>
   Two car bombs left one person dead and 11 injured on Tuesday. On
Monday, a car laden with 55 pounds of explosives blew up in the
Basque city of Bilbao in northern Spain, killing four suspected ETA
terrorists. Since ending a 14-month cease-fire in December, ETA has
been blamed for nine deaths in about 20 attacks.
</P>
<P>
   At Casanova's funeral Thursday, the archbishop of Pamplona,
Fernando Sebastian, urged Spaniards not ''to be overcome by the
poison of hatred and revenge.''
</P>
<P>
   A dozen town councilors and other politicians belonging to
Euskal Herritarrok had gathered on the other side of Pamplona town
hall's square from the protesters. The party is widely considered
the political wing of ETA.
</P>
<P>
   The party on Wednesday had asked permission to hold a
demonstration but was turned down, the region's Interior Ministry
office said.

<HEADLINE> Reform Party Feud Intensifies  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE KELLMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- Reform Party candidate Pat Buchanan
pledged Thursday to make ''America a godly nation again'' by
cracking down on abortion and ''rampant homosexuality'' if he makes
it to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The conservative former Republican issued his personal manifesto
as his adopted party opened its convention by fracturing into two
separate meetings -- Buchanan backers and those of party founder
Ross Perot.
</P>
<P>
   ''While the Reform Party platform is silent on what have come to
be called the social, cultural and moral issues, I do not believe
presidential candidates can remain silent,'' Buchanan wrote.
</P>
<P>
   His ''Statement of Personal Belief'' stands in sharp contrast to
the third party's platform, which calls for campaign finance and
other government reforms. Instead, Buchanan pins the foundation of
his campaign on social issues, pledging to eradicate late-term and
taxpayer-funded abortions and to bar homosexuals from military
service.
</P>
<P>
   ''I will put moral authority of the office behind the causes of
life, faith and country, and support a rule of law based on a moral
order that is rooted in Biblical truth and the laws written by God
on the human heart,'' Buchanan said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
   ''High among the purposes of this campaign is to build a party
that will set about making America a godly nation again.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan listed six pledges, if elected:
</P>
<P>
   -- Appoint only anti-abortion conservatives to the Supreme Court
and impose term limits on federal judges.
</P>
<P>
   -- Eliminate taxpayer-funded abortions and fetal tissue research.
He also pledged to outlaw late-term abortions, comparing the
procedure to Nazi torture. ''When one reflects that German doctors
were executed after World War II for having participated in
Hitler's euthanasia program, what does that say about us as a
nation?''
</P>
<P>
   -- Require a ''family impact statement'' for proposed changes in
U.S. social policy and tax reforms.
</P>
<P>
   -- Refuse to give homosexuals extra protection under civil rights
laws. ''Rampant homosexuality (is) a sign of cultural decadence and
moral decline from Rome to Weimar,'' he said, calling it ''a
lifestyle ruinous to body and soul alike.'' Buchanan also said
persecuting homosexuals is wrong.
</P>
<P>
   -- Exempt women from the military service except as volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   -- Put ''the moral authority'' of the presidency behind every
decision.
</P>
<P>
   The statement confirmed the fears of Buchanan's opponents, led
by party officials who helped found the organization in its headier
days when Perot captured 19 percent of the vote in 1992. The party
has taken a hands-off approach to social issues, believing
government should have no role in such personal matters.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think it's going to serve any purpose, saying things
like that, which are just inflammatory,'' said Stanley Spink, a
delegate from North Kingstown, R.I., who opposes Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can be sure that's among the reasons people (in the party)
have split,'' said his wife, delegate June Spink.
</P>
<P>
   The battle for control of the party is aimed partly at gaining
$12.5 million in federal funds that go with the Reform Party
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Allies of Perot, who has stayed silent, have rallied around
little-known candidate John Hagelin as the only alternative to
Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   Hagelin appeared to respond to Buchanan in his own speech to
more than 1,000 people in the breakaway convention next door.
</P>
<P>
   The path to victory is ''not through a message of exclusivity
and intolerance, not through embroiling ourselves in divisive
social issues,'' he said. ''But by putting forth an inclusive
message, a broad-based platform of commonsense reforms, that the
overwhelming majority of people support.''
</P>
<P>
   Added former party chairman Russell Verney, a Hagelin backer:
''If you have hate in your heart, get out the door, we don't want
you.''
</P>
<P>
   While Buchanan focused on America's ''moral crisis,'' Hagelin
offered proposals on a litany of issues, including campaign-finance
reform, preventive health care, clean energy, teachers' salaries
and foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   He predicted the party would rise from the disarray, declaring:
''The reports of the demise of the Reform Party are exaggerated.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the dueling conventions both plan to convene, which
could mean two presidential candidates will be nominated.
</P>
<P>
   Perot and Hagelin supporters on Thursday filed a complaint with
the Federal Election Commission seeking to keep Buchanan from
receiving the campaign money, and the matter could end up in court.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint charged Buchanan with election fraud. He denies
the charge, counting 70 percent of some 600 delegates and party
Chairman Gerry Moan, who controls the party's finances, on his
side.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm depressed about the whole situation,'' said Wendall
Kinney, a delegate from Maine who said he is neutral and helped
found the party. ''The country needs a third party, other voices,
to survive.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday morning, Perot supporters had stormed the Buchanan
convention hall and were peacefully turned away before opening
their own proceedings at a performing arts center down the block.
</P>
<P>
   ''We Shall Overcome,'' Perot supporters sang as they marched
away.
</P>
<P>
   ''This reminds me of the old civil rights days of the 60s,''
Mississippi delegate Lee Dillsworth yelled into a bullhorn.

<HEADLINE> 2 Killed in Navy Helicopter Crash  </HEADLINE>
By MEGAN K. STACK
<TEXT>
<P>
   CORPUS CHRISTI, Texas (AP) -- Two crew members were killed and
two others were missing Thursday after a Navy helicopter crashed in
the Gulf of Mexico during a training mission. Two others on board
were recovering from injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The survivors were found floating in a life raft about half an
hour after the helicopter went down.
</P>
<P>
   Jeremy J. Yaklin, 19, of Lapeer, Mich., and Adan Shawn R. Palyo,
20, of Stratford, Conn., were hospitalized in stable condition in
Corpus Christi, said Lt. j.g. Chuck Bell with Naval Air Station
Corpus Christi.
</P>
<P>
   Cdr. Bob Riehl, commanding officer of the HM-15 mine
countermeasures squadron based at the station, identified one of
those killed as Jeffrey S. Paschal, 40, of Phoenix. The identity of
the second victim was being withheld until family members could be
notified.
</P>
<P>
   The crew was aboard an MH-53E helicopter, also known as a Sea
Dragon, that crashed about 11 a.m. some 17 miles offshore in about
50 feet of water. Crew members reported mechanical problems before
the craft went down, Bell said.
</P>
<P>
   A search over a 28-square-mile area will continue through the
night for the remaining two crew members, Riehl said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a big area. It's a big ocean,'' he said. ''I always have
hope.''
</P>
<P>
   All the crew members were equipped with survival gear including
strobes, radios and oxygen cylinders. ''The survivability rate is
very good down here,'' said David McBride, a Coast Guard spokesman.
The water temperature is about 80 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   The helicopter was practicing mine-sweeping as part of a
training mission when it reported a mechanical malfunction, Riehl
said. It was attempting to return to shore when it crashed, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Another helicopter taking part in the training mission spotted
wreckage about 15 minutes after the distress call.
</P>
<P>
   The MH-53E is manufactured by Sikorsky Aircraft Corp. in
Stratford, Conn. In 1996, a similar model, the CH-53E Super
Stallion, crashed, killing four Sikorsky employees in Stratford.
The Navy temporarily halted flights of all ''E'' models, including
the Super Stallion and the Sea Dragon. A faulty bearing was blamed
for the 1996 crash.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to mine-countermeasures, the MH-53E can be used to
tow vessels, transport cargo and transport equipment. The
helicopter can carry 55 passengers, or a 16-ton payload.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, six members of the same squadron were killed in the
Persian Gulf when their Sea Dragon helicopter crashed after taking
off from a ship north of Bahrain.

<HEADLINE> Police Link Killings to Extortion  </HEADLINE>
By RON HARRIS
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, Calif. (AP) -- A botched plot to extort $100,000 from an
elderly couple led to the murders of five people, including blues
guitarist Elvin Bishop's daughter, who may have been in on the
scheme, police said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Two brothers and their female roommate were arrested on drug
possession and burglary charges, and police consider them
''potential suspects'' in the slayings.
</P>
<P>
   Selina Bishop, 22, may have joined in the scheme before she was
killed, Concord Police Lt. Paul Crain said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously she had a relationship with these people. We're
trying to understand exactly what her involvement was, and at what
point she became a victim,'' Crain said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the biggest mysteries are when and where Bishop was
killed. Her remains and those of Ivan and Annette Stineman were
believed to be spread among at least eight duffel bags pulled from
a Sacramento County river this week.
</P>
<P>
   It's also unclear whether the Stinemans were forced to write two
checks before they were killed or if someone forged the signature,
Crain said.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop -- or someone else posing as her -- called a bank before
the checks written to her name were cashed last week, Crain said.
One police theory is that she may have fled and was killed after
objecting to the Stinemans' deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Fingerprints show Ivan Stineman is one of the three victims
whose remains were found in the bags, and coroners were working
Thursday to positively identify his wife and Bishop as the others.
</P>
<P>
   A chainsaw and a sawhorse were found inside the Stineman's van,
which was abandoned in Oakland with the keys still in the ignition,
Crain said.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop had been dating Glenn Helzer, 30, who had been the
elderly couple's former stockbroker, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said that connection helped them link the
disappearance of the Stinemans and Bishop last week to the shooting
deaths of Bishop's mother, Jennifer Villarin, 45, and her friend
Joseph Gamble, 54, who were found in Bishop's apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn and his brother Justin Helzer, 28, were arrested Monday
along with their roommate Dawn Godman, 26, in their home down the
street from the Stinemans. Police also found drugs in the home.
</P>
<P>
   The three were arraigned Wednesday but did not enter pleas. They
were being held without bail and are due back in court Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Public defender Penny Scanlon, who represented the Helzers and
Godman at their initial appearance, did not immediately return a
phone call Thursday. It was unclear whether private attorneys had
been hired for any of them.
</P>
<P>
   While no one has been charged in any of the murders, Glenn
Helzer made statements linking himself to the elderly couple's
disappearance, Contra Costa Deputy District Attorney Hall Jewett
said.
</P>
<P>
   The night Ivan Stineman, 85, and his wife, 78, were last seen
alive, a neighbor saw two men with long ponytails entering their
home, Crain said.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop was last seen alive with Glenn Helzer three days later at
a Berkeley pub. The next morning, her mother was shot to death in
Bishop's bed.
</P>
<P>
   As police raided the Helzers' home, Godman and Glenn Helzer fled
out the back door. Glenn Helzer allegedly broke into a nearby home,
armed himself with two kitchen knives and cut off his ponytail with
a pair of scissors.
</P>
<P>
   Had he killed somebody? His hostages wanted to know.
</P>
<P>
   ''Not yet,'' Helzer replied, according to police.
</P>
<P>
   The Helzers and Godman were raised as Mormons, and Glenn and
Justin had served their two-year missions. Glenn later married and
has two daughters. The Helzers' grandfather, Helmuth Helzer, told
The San Francisco Chronicle that the two brothers apparently got
involved with drugs and that Glenn lost his stock broker job at
Dean Witter and abandoned his family.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop reportedly met Glenn Helzer at a ''rave'' concert. Local
newspapers reported that she, the Helzers and Godman were active in
the ''goth'' movement, dressing in dark colors and spending time in
bars frequented by followers of occult activities.
</P>
<P>
   Elvin Bishop, best known for his 1976 pop hit ''Fooled Around
and Fell in Love,'' has not commented on the case, according to
Mike Grill, who works for Alligator Records in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Carma and Jerry Helzer, the suspects' parents, sat through
Thursday's news conference at the Concord Police station.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know what the truth is, but I will not tell you what the
truth is,'' Mrs. Helzer said, adding: ''I would like the victims'
families to join me in prayer.''

<HEADLINE> Brazil's Landless Workers Protest  </HEADLINE>
By HAROLD OLMOS
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) -- Thousands of landless peasants rallied
in front of the U.S. Embassy on Thursday, burning an American flag
to protest the foreign lenders and their country's free market
policies.
</P>
<P>
   The initials IMF, standing for the International Monetary Fund,
were painted on the back of the flag.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters linked to the Landless Rural Workers Movement, a
peasant organization seeking land reform, also smashed the plaque
identifying the compound as the U.S. Embassy.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-riots police units were kept on alert, but there was no
violence, a U.S. official said. Local media estimated 10,000 to
20,000 people took part in the protest.
</P>
<P>
   ''The actions of the government (of Brazil) are dictated by the
IMF which, in turn, obeys to the United States government's
policies,'' said Christiane Campos, a member of the movement.
</P>
<P>
   ''High rates of unemployment and widespread poverty result from
those policies. With this action we are showing that we don't want
an economy subdued to a foreign control that favors the rich,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF led a $41.5 billion bailout of Brazil's economy two
years ago that forced the country to curtail social spending and
divert money to paying off its massive foreign debt.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters call the IMF's requirements unwanted foreign
control and say they serve the interest of rich lenders at the
expense of Brazil's poor.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers said the march was also aimed at putting pressure on
the government to speed up land reform.
</P>
<P>
   Although the current administration says it has distributed more
land in the past five years than any other government in Brazilian
history, the peasant group says the pace is still too slow.

<HEADLINE> Cesar Chavez Holiday Seen in Calif.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- California would become the first
state to honor United Farm Workers founder Cesar Chavez with a
holiday under a measure approved Thursday by the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez, who died in 1993, spent his life organizing and fighting
to improve conditions for the predominantly Hispanic and immigrant
people who work in the nation's fields and orchards.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Gov. Gray Davis has promised to sign the bill to make
March 31 a holiday for state workers and an optional holiday for
public schools.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's time for us to honor the memory of the man who did so
much for the Latino community,'' said Assemblyman Robert Pacheco,
who worked in cotton fields as a boy.
</P>
<P>
   The bill easily passed the Assembly and Senate; Republicans cast
the only no votes.
</P>
<P>
   ''What kind of bill is this to give state workers a day off and
leave farmworkers working in the fields?'' asked GOP Assemblyman
Mike Briggs.

   GARDEN GROVE, Calif. (AP) -- Democratic Party officials today removed Rep.
Loretta Sanchez from her speaking role at next week's party convention, hours
after she refused to cancel a fund-raiser at the Playboy Mansion. Saying he was
''sorely disappointed'' in Sanchez, DNC chairman Joe Andrew said he had ''no
alternative but to take action.'' Under pressure from Al Gore's presidential
campaign, party officials were planning to meet tomorrow and could take further
action, including revoking her convention credentials.

   LONG BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- Seeking the Reform Party presidential nomination,
Pat Buchanan pledged today to make ''America a godly nation again'' by cracking
down on abortion and ''rampant homosexuality.'' The conservative former
Republican issued his personal manifesto as his adopted party opened its
convention by fracturing into two separate meetings -- Buchanan backers and
those of party founder Ross Perot. The battle for control of the party is aimed
partly at gaining $12.5 million in federal funds that goes with the nomination.

ministers, Clinton called the affair ''a terrible mistake.'' ''I feel much more
at peace than I used to,'' he told the clergymen, saying the disgrace made him
face the truth. He claimed that more than 60 percent of Americans have ''stuck

   DALLAS (AP) -- Motorists waited for hours at overtaxed tire stores today in
the hunt for replacements for Firestone tires the company is recalling because
of concerns they may be a factor in a series of car crashes. So far, the company
is only recalling tires in four states as it tries to manage demand. At least
one other manufacturer, Goodyear, announced it was increasing production to help
meet demand created by Bridgestone/Firestone Inc.'s recall of 6.5 million tires
-- most of which are on Ford sport utility vehicles and light trucks.

<HEADLINE> Ramseys' Former Housekeeper Sues  </HEADLINE>
By JUDITH KOHLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- John and Patsy Ramsey's former housekeeper is
challenging a state law preventing her from revealing what she told
a grand jury about their daughter JonBenet's death.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Hoffman-Pugh filed the lawsuit Thursday in federal court.
</P>
<P>
   She plans to write a book about her time with the Ramseys and
her appearance before the grand jury that investigated the
6-year-old's death. But a state law prohibits grand jury witnesses
from publicly discussing their testimony ''in perpetuity'' if no
reports or indictments are issued.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman-Pugh's lawsuit argues that the Colorado law violates
witnesses' First Amendment right of free speech.
</P>
<P>
   The grand jury looking into the girl's 1996 death adjourned in
October without issuing any indictments.
</P>
<P>
   L. Lin Wood, who represents the Ramseys, said he wasn't familiar
with the Colorado law. ''But logic and fairness, in my opinion,
would dictate that all the grand jury testimony be made public,
including Linda Hoffman-Pugh's,'' Wood said Thursday from his
office in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor Bill Wise declined to comment on the lawsuit, saying
no one in the office had seen it.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman-Pugh worked for the Ramseys for 14 months. She was
questioned about JonBenet's death and gave police blood, hair and
handwriting samples.
</P>
<P>
   JonBenet was found beaten and strangled in the basement of her
Boulder home on Dec. 26, 1996. Her body was found hours after Patsy
Ramsey reported finding a note demanding money for the girl's safe
return.
</P>
<P>
   No suspects have ever been named in the case, although
authorities say the parents remain under suspicion. The Ramseys
have denied any involvement and say they believe an intruder was
responsible.

<HEADLINE> Dolphins 15, Bucs 13  </HEADLINE>
By STEVEN WINE
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- The Miami Dolphins' first team dominated the
opening half, and Olindo Mare kicked his fifth field goal with nine
seconds left to beat the Tampa Bay Buccaneers 15-13 in an
exhibition game Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Quinn, competing for the third-string quarterback job,
moved Miami 44 yards in the final 1:03 to set up Mare's
game-winning kick, a 42-yarder. The Pro Bowl kicker finished
5-for-5, also scoring from 26, 21, 54 and 25 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay's reserves, helped by two long kickoff returns,
rallied with two fourth-quarter touchdowns to take the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams are 1-1. They'll meet in the regular season Dec. 10
in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins' first team played the opening half, rushing for 76
yards, converting six third downs and controlling the ball for more
than 18 minutes. But they led only 6-0 at halftime because of two
turnovers by Damon Huard, who threw an interception at the Bucs' 12
and lost a fumble at their 23.
</P>
<P>
   ''We moved the ball,'' Huard said. ''We didn't score points, and
that's a disappointment. We had turnovers, which are terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   Huard was 10-for-17 for 101 yards with three sacks. Lamar Smith
rushed for 72 yards in 17 carries, all in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was real happy with the running game, and I really liked
what Lamar Smith did,'' coach Dave Wannstedt said.
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins twice used receiver Bert Emanuel at quarterback in
third-and-short situations, and each time they picked up the first
down. He handed off once and kept once for 2 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay started slowly, receiving a delay of game penalty
before kicking off to begin the game, and didn't muster much
offense until the final period.
</P>
<P>
   The Bucs' first-team offense was 0-for-5 on third down and
struggled running the ball for the second consecutive week. Warrick
Dunn managed just 18 yards in nine carries.
</P>
<P>
   Shaun King played the first two quarters and went 9-for-13 for
83 yards, but he threw an interception to end the Bucs' best threat
of the half.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are playing very poorly right now,'' coach Tony Dungy said.
''It just wasn't a good half of football.''
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay lost two safeties to injury in the first half. John
Lynch bruised his ribs and Dexter Jackson sprained his right ankle.
</P>
<P>
   Miami cornerback Patrick Surtain left the game in the first half
with bruised ribs.
</P>
<P>
   Yo Murphy's 51-yard kickoff return set up the Bucs' first score,
which came on a 17-yard pass from Eric Zeier to Kevin McLeod. Aaron
Stecker returned a kickoff 78 yards, then scored on a 2-yard run
with 3:50 left to put the Bucs ahead 13-12.
</P>
<P>
   A mistake by Shevin Smith gave the Dolphins three points at the
end of the first half. With 16 seconds left, Huard threw an
alley-oop pass from midfield, and Smith tackled receiver Emanuel
before the ball came down. The 48-yard pass interference penalty
set up a field goal by Mare as time expired.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest ovation from the crowd of 58,703 followed a 17-yard
reception by Miami newcomer Thurman Thomas, long a thorn in the
Dolphins' side with the Buffalo Bills.

<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- Ford Canada said Thursday it was recalling up to
283,000 vehicles as part of the Bridgestone/Firestone Inc. effort
to replace tires being investigated in dozens of crashes.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 180,000 vehicles were being recalled immediately to

and some F-150 pickup trucks made in 1991-94, company spokesman
John Arnone said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he said, 103,000 vehicles -- Rangers and some
Explorers made in 1997-2000 -- were being recalled for inspection
and possible replacement of tires.
</P>
<P>
   Bridgestone/Firestone, which announced a recall of 6.5 million
tires in the United States on Wednesday, has yet to provide details
of its recall plan for Canada. In the United States, customers who
bought vehicles with the suspect tires will receive letters
notifying them of the recall in a process expected to be completed
by the end of 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Arnone said Ford Canada had been inundated with telephone calls
from worried customers and wanted to give them the chance to begin
the recall process immediately.

<HEADLINE> Steelers 13, Panthers 0  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN ROBINSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- The Pittsburgh Steelers turned one of
injury-depleted Carolina's three turnovers into Kordell Stewart's
4-yard scoring run and their third consecutive preseason victory,
13-0 over the Panthers on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Kris Brown kicked field goals of 53 and 33 yards, one just
before halftime following another turnover, as the Steelers'
inefficient offense was held to a single touchdown for the second
game in a row.
</P>
<P>
   The Steelers have scored 26 points in two games since beating
Dallas 38-10 in their preseason opener, yet managed to win both
times even as Stewart was a combined 1-of-13 passing for 3 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart was 1-of-7 for 8 yards against the Panthers, who left
much of their rebuilt defense back in Carolina with assorted
injuries. Eighteen Panthers, or nearly one-quarter of their roster,
were listed on the pregame injury report, including most of their
better-known players: Steve Beuerlein, Reggie White, Eric Swann and
Muhsin Muhammad.
</P>
<P>
   The Panthers lost two more players to injuries during the game,
wide receivers Patrick Jeffers (sprained knee) and Jim Turner
(strained hamstring). Steelers rookie receiver Danny Farmer left in
the second half with a sprained ankle.
</P>
<P>
   Just as they did a week ago in a 34-14 loss to Jacksonville,
quarterbacks Jeff Lewis and Dameyune Craig couldn't move a Panthers
offense that couldn't run with consistency or complete anything
except flare passes that usually gained only a handful of yards.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, starting for the second week in a row for Beuerlein, was
11-of-14 for 54 yards with no completion longer than 12 yards.
Craig had more rushing yards (29) than passing yards (19) while
going 2-of-11.
</P>
<P>
   The Panthers -- outscored 47-14 so far in the preseason --
threatened only once, driving to the Steelers' 4 in the second
quarter with Lewis in the game before Tim Biakabutuka fumbled on
fourth down and lost a yard.
</P>
<P>
   The Steelers led 7-0 at the time, needing to drive but 11 yards
for the game's only touchdown after Jason Gildon recovered Lewis'
fumble at the Panthers' 11.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Fuamatu-Ma'afala gained 7 yards on two carries before
Stewart scrambled to score from the 4 on third-and-3 with 9:05 left
in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Fuamatu-Ma'afala, who led a 13-10 comeback victory over Miami on
Saturday by running for 122 yards and a touchdown, managed four
carries for 19 yards before leaving with bruised ribs.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's 33-yard field goal on the final play of the first half
followed an 11-play drive led by backup quarterback Kent Graham
after Chad Scott's end zone interception of Craig's pass.
</P>
<P>
   Graham, 10-of-18 for 95 yards, also led an 11-play drive at the
start of the third quarter that ended with Brown's 53-yard field
goal at 10:02. Graham kept the drive going by finding Troy Edwards
for 10 yards on third-and-3 from the Panthers' 47.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Wright followed Stewart and Graham and was 6-of-9 for 59
yards. Steelers free agent Pepe Pearson of Ohio State was the
leading rusher with 52 yards on seven carries, all in the second
half.

<HEADLINE> Rebels: Food Shortages in Sudan  </HEADLINE>
By CHEGE MBITIRU
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) -- An estimated 3 million people in southern
Sudan face severe food shortages because government bombings have
forced relief agencies to suspend operations, a rebel spokesman
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The bombings have been directed at relief agency compounds and
are not harming the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army, said
Elijah Malok, head of the Sudan Relief and Rehabilitation
Association, the humanitarian wing of the SPLA rebels.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was actually a looming humanitarian crisis in the
making,'' Malok told a news conference in Kenya. ''The bombing has
complicated an already complicated situation.''
</P>
<P>
   He said his agency thinks about three million people will be
affected by drought or war.
</P>
<P>
   The hardest hit provinces are Bahr el Gazal, southern Kodorfan,
west of the Nile River, and southern and western Upper Blue Nile,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Sudan's air force bombed relief facilities in the
rebel-held town of Mapel for the second time in three days, forcing
the U.N. World Food Program to evacuate its workers.
</P>
<P>
   Mapel serves as a forward base for Operation Lifeline Sudan, a
U.N.-led group of relief agencies working in southern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   OLS flights were also suspended following Monday's bombing of
Mapel. Relief agencies issued a statement Wednesday in Nairobi
saying there had been 33 bombings since the attacks escalated in
July.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Sudan's Social Planning Ministry said it regretted
the suspension of the relief flights and urged U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan to ''take urgent steps to bring the
OLS operation back to work.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement broadcast on state television, the ministry also
appealed to the United Nations and the world community to ''put
pressure on the rebel movement to respect completely the
cease-fire.''
</P>
<P>
   The southern, largely Christian rebels took up arms in 1983 to
press for increased autonomy from the predominantly Muslim and
Arabized north.

<HEADLINE> Girl Assaulted After Phillies Game  </HEADLINE>
By JEN LIN-LIU
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- One youth has been arrested and two others
were being sought Thursday in connection with a sexual assault on
an 11-year-old girl after a Philadelphia Phillies game.
</P>
<P>
   The girl, who was visiting Philadelphia, was treated at
Jefferson Hospital on Wednesday night and released, police said.
The attack occurred at approximately 10:30 p.m. Wednesday about 100
yards from Veterans Stadium in a dark, secluded area.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Thursday night they had arrested one juvenile and
were looking for two others.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Joseph Mooney of the police Special Victims Unit, which
investigates sex crimes, said he would not specify the nature of
the acts, but said that no weapons were used during the assault.
The names of the victim and her aunt were not released.
</P>
<P>
   Mooney described the boys as 15- or 16-year-olds wearing
T-shirts that suggested they might be concession-stand workers.
</P>
<P>
   The girl had been accompanied by her aunt, but was separated
from her when the girl needed to use the restroom after the game.
When the girl emerged from the restroom, she was unable to find her
aunt, but ran into three boys whom she had met during the game,
police said.
</P>
<P>
   The boys told her they would help her find her aunt. The assault
took place shortly after, and the boys fled, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The girl's aunt found her outside of the stadium and took her to
the hospital, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Mooney declined to comment on security outside of Veterans
Stadium.

<HEADLINE> Ark. Governor Laughs With Leno  </HEADLINE>
By JAMES JEFFERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE ROCK (AP) -- ''Tonight Show'' host Jay Leno poked fun at
Arkansas' first couple face-to-face Thursday night over their move
from the Governor's Mansion to a triplewide manufactured home, and
Gov. Mike Huckabee gave it right back.
</P>
<P>
   After weeks of humorous jabs from NBC's late-night king,
Huckabee and his wife, Janet, agreed to join in, videotaping a
segment via satellite for airing Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope you're not too upset with some of the jokes,'' Leno
began.
</P>
<P>
   ''I tell you what, Jay,'' the governor said. ''We feel so good
about it, I'm going to send you a full set of Firestone tires for
your car.''
</P>
<P>
   When Leno referred to the manufactured home as a doublewide,
Mrs. Huckabee corrected him.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's actually a triplewide. We actually call that a
multi-section manufactured home,'' she explained.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's actually large enough so that we could get you and your
chin inside,'' the governor added, drawing howls of laughter from
Leno's television audience.
</P>
<P>
   The first family will be moving in to the donated $110,000
manufactured home behind the Governor's Mansion later this month
while the 50-year-old mansion is renovated.
</P>
<P>
   Leno asked if Arkansas voters might consider their governor as
putting on airs, getting uppity by living in such lavish quarters.
</P>
<P>
   ''Anybody that has a doublewide, a bass boat and a good dog,
what more does a man need?'' Huckabee said. ''But, by God, we're
going to try to keep it humble.''
</P>
<P>
   Huckabee said afterward that he decided to play along with the
ribbing because it was all in fun.
</P>
<P>
   ''One of the things we want to do is to show that people in
Arkansas aren't all that sensitive about people making light of
us,'' Huckabee said. ''We know who we are. The truth is that the
only people who really get bent out of shape about someone poking
fun at them are the people who are getting real close to the
truth.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Drug Czar Heads to Colombia  </HEADLINE>
By WILL WEISSERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARTAGENA, Colombia (AP) -- President Andres Pastrana met with
two top Clinton administration officials Thursday to coordinate
Washington's $1.3 billion anti-narcotics initiative.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting with Barry McCaffrey, director of the White House
National Drug Control Policy Office, and U.S. Under Secretary of
State Thomas Pickering came the same day that Pastrana approved the
extradition of an accused drug trafficker to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey and Pickering told a press conference after their
session with Pastrana that much work remained to be done in
determining where some of the funds should go.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new aid package, the United States is training
Colombian anti-narcotic army troops and providing them with combat
helicopters to seize cocaine- and heroin-producing plantations from
leftist rebels and right-wing paramilitary groups, which have a
lucrative protection rackets going.
</P>
<P>
   But the package, approved by Congress and signed by President
Bill Clinton last month, also includes more than $400 million for
nonmilitary projects such as alternative crop development,
McCaffrey pointed out.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials must still work out with their Colombian
counterparts specifically where these funds will go.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a process that we will need to develop as we go
along,'' Pickering said.
</P>
<P>
   Also in limbo after Thursday's meetings was the fate of about
1,000 Colombian troops who have completed training with U.S.
military specialists provided as part of an old aid package, but
have yet to begin anti-narcotics operations.
</P>
<P>
   But McCaffrey said Wednesday night that those soldiers were a
''tiny chip'' in Colombia's war against drugs and would not likely
begin anti-drug missions until more U.S.-trained military forces
are ready to join them.
</P>
<P>
   The delegation returned to the United States on Thursday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The trip helped lay the groundwork for Clinton's Aug. 30 visit
to Colombia. It will be the first Colombian visit by a U.S.
president since George Bush spent less than a day here in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's meeting comes less than a week after 83 U.S. Special
Forces personnel began training Colombian soldiers at a base in
southern Colombia's Amazonian jungle. The base is a two-hour drive
from the main stronghold of the guerrilla Revolutionary Armed
Forces of Colombia, or FARC.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Thursday, Pastrana signed an order for accused drug
trafficker Alberto Orlandez Gamboa to be extradited to the United
States to stand trial.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia's Supreme Court this week had cleared the way for the
extradition of Gamboa, identified by U.S. officials as one of
Colombia's most powerful and ruthless drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   Orlandez would become the third Colombian extradited to the
United States since the country lifted its ban on extraditions in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   According to an indictment filed in U.S. District Court in
Manhattan last year, Gamboa is the head of an international drug
trafficking and money laundering organization headquartered in
Barranquilla, on Colombia's Caribbean coast.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. federal prosecutors say Gamboa conspired to import
thousands of kilograms of cocaine from Colombia to New York and
other U.S. destinations and distribute it. He is also accused of
smuggling cocaine to Europe since 1991 and conspiring to launder
millions of dollars in drug profits.

<HEADLINE> Padres 15, Phillies 3  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Bret Boone and Phil Nevin each hit three-run
homers as the San Diego Padres set seasons highs for hits and runs
Thursday night in a 15-3 rout of the Philadelphia Phillies.
</P>
<P>
   Former Phillie Desi Relaford, and Joe Vitiello also homered for
the Padres, who have won nine of their last 12 games. San Diego got
19 hits, including nine for extra bases, and split the four-game
series.
</P>
<P>
   It was the most runs for the Padres since beating Houston 13-3
on June 10, and the most hits since getting 19 at Colorado on July
2, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Relaford, Damian Jackson, Wiki Gonzalez and Mike Darr each had
three hits. to back Woody Williams (7-4), who won for the third
time in four starts. He allowed three runs and six hits in six
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Wolf (9-6) was pounded for nine runs -- eight earned -- 12
hits and four walks in 5 2-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Boone broke a 1-1 tie in the fourth with his 19th homer, putting
the Padres ahead 4-1.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Glanville's RBI triple and Bobby Abreu's sacrifice fly
pulled the Phillies to 4-3 in the fifth, but Relaford homered in a
five-run sixth that also include Vitiello's sacrifice fly and
Nevin's 24th homer.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson added a two-run triple off Wayne Gomes in the seventh
that made it 11-3. Philadelphia added four in the eighth off Mark
Holzemer on Vitiello's solo homer, Darr's two-run triple and
Relaford's RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia, which gave up its most runs since a 14-9 loss to
the Chicago Cubs on July 26, went ahead in the first on Mike
Lieberthal RBI single. Darr's run-scoring grounder tied it in the
second.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Phillies 3B Scott Rolen was a late scratch due to a
strained left wrist. ... Glanville's first-inning double extended
his hitting streak to 11 games. ... Nevin has nine extra-base hits
(six doubles and three homers) during his current seven-game
hitting streak. ...Relaford's homer was his first as a Padre (five
games) and his first in 150 at-bats. ... Williams went 2-for-4,
raising his average to .324. ... Boone went 2-for-2 with an
intentional walk against Wolf. For his career, Boone is 4-for-4
with two walks against him. ... The hits were the most off the
Phillies since Cincinnati got 19 last Sept. 4. ... Phillies manager
Terry Francona was ejected by first-base umpire Charlie Williams in
the seventh inning. Francona, who had argued another call early in
the game by Williams, complained that Jackson's triple should have
been ruled a ground-rule double. Television replays clearly showed
the ball bounced over the fence. It was Francona's second ejection
this season.

<HEADLINE> Olympian Detained for Russian Plot  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Police have detained a four-time Olympic champion
on suspicion that he helped orchestrate a plot to assassinate a
prominent Russian governor, officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander Tikhonov was one of four people arrested Monday, and
police searching his apartment later found a cache of weapons and
ammunition, a spokesman with the Federal Security Service told
state-owned RTR television.
</P>
<P>
   RTR reported that Tikhonov, under guard in Moscow's Lefortovo
prison, faces charges in the alleged plot to poison Kemerovo Gov.
Aman Tuleyev.
</P>
<P>
   Tikhonov was a Soviet biathlete who won team gold in four
straight winter Olympics, from 1968-1980. He also won an individual
silver in 1968. He is now a businessman who runs bakeries.
</P>
<P>
   Security officials announced Tuesday they had foiled the plot to
kill Tuleyev, a Communist who came in fourth in March presidential
elections. Tuleyev said the plot appeared linked to attempts to
gain control of metallurgy factories in his province.
</P>
<P>
   Russian news reports suggested a possible link to organized
crime and said Tuleyev's would-be assassins had been promised
$700,000 for the hit.
</P>
<P>
   While contract killings involving disputes over control of
businesses and public funds are commonplace in Russian politics and
business, they rarely involve such prominent figures.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan's Allies and China Clash  </HEADLINE>
By EDITH M. LEDERER
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Taiwan's allies called Thursday for the
economically powerful island to join the United Nations, but China
insisted that Taiwan is one of its provinces and not eligible to be
a U.N. member.
</P>
<P>
   The rival views, spelled out in letters to Secretary-General
Kofi Annan, set the stage for an eighth attempt by Taiwan's allies
to get the U.N. General Assembly to consider membership for Taiwan
when it meets in September.
</P>
<P>
   The attempt is doomed to fail this year, as it has for the past
seven years, because Beijing's contention that there is only one
China enjoys widespread support. Last year, the General Assembly's
steering committee decided without a vote not to include the issue
of Taiwan on the assembly's agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the annual ritual puts the spotlight on the
contentious issue and the current state of relations between China
and Taiwan, which installed a newly elected president in May, Chen
Shui-Bian. He has taken a conciliatory stance toward China,
offering to discuss any issue at a summit, but insisting the island
is not controlled by China.
</P>
<P>
   When it was based in China, Taiwan's former Nationalist
government was one of the founding members of the United Nations in
1945. The Nationalist regime, representing the Republic of China,
kept its U.N. seat after the Communist Party captured the mainland
in 1949 and forced the Nationalists to retreat to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Anticipating a humiliating expulsion from the world body, the
Taiwan-based government gave up its U.N. seat in 1971 after the
United Nations accepted the communist government in Beijing as the
sole legitimate ruler of China.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1993, Taipei has mounted a campaign for equal
representation with China in the United Nations while Beijing has
been campaigning for Taiwan's reunification with the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   In their letter, a dozen of Taiwan's allies from Africa, the
Caribbean, Central America and the South Pacific said Taiwan's
democratically elected government ''is the sole legitimate one that
can actually represent the interests and wishes of the people of
Taiwan in the United Nations.''
</P>
<P>
   ''As Tuvalu of the South Pacific is to be admitted to the United
Nations later this year, the Republic of China on Taiwan will then
be the only country in the world that remains excluded from the
United Nations. Therefore, there is an urgent need to examine this
situation from a whole new perspective and redress this mistaken
omission,'' the allies said.
</P>
<P>
   But China's U.N. Ambassador Wang Yingfan countered that by
raising the U.N. membership issue, Taiwan's allies were committing
an ''illegal act'' and ''grossly'' interfering in China's internal
affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The new Taiwan leaders, he said, have ''attempted to continue
their separatist moves against the motherland and create 'two
Chinas' or 'one China, one Taiwan' within the United Nations system
under the cloak of 'democracy' and 'human rights.'''
</P>
<P>
   ''Such separatist moves by the Taiwan authorities are the source
of tension in the Taiwan Straits,'' Wang said.

Thousands Change Tires After Recall
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- Motorists waited for hours at overtaxed tire stores today in
the hunt for replacements for Firestone tires the company is recalling because
of concerns they may be a factor in a series of car crashes. So far, the company
is only recalling tires in four states as it tries to manage demand. At least
one other manufacturer, Goodyear, announced it was increasing production to help
meet demand created by Bridgestone/Firestone Inc.'s recall of 6.5 million tires
-- most of which are on Ford sport utility vehicles and light trucks.

<HEADLINE> If Clinton elected in New York, doubts will be erased, president says </HEADLINE>
By SONYA ROSS
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - President Clinton lavished praise on his wife
Thursday for pursuing a Senate seat from New York and promised that
if she is elected, doubtful New Yorkers ''will never have another
question'' about her qualifications.
</P>
<P>
   The president joined first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton for a
$25,000-a-plate dinner at the Upper East Side home of John and
Margo Catsimatidis. The event brought in $500,000 for the first
lady's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The president said he regrets that he and his wife had to
abandon plans to spend his last year in office traveling together,
but he doesn't mind because his wife is pursuing her dream.
</P>
<P>
   ''In 30 years, all she ever did was try to help other people,''
he said. ''This is the first time she's ever, ever done anything
where she's asking people to help her. Even though I'm kind of
missing this last year we looked forward to, I'm glad she's doing
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The president stressed his wife's history of advocacy for
children and families, work that ''is basically the kind of thing
New York needs in Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   ''If you get her elected, she'll be a magnificent senator,'' he
said. To those who question why she is seeking office from New
York, he said: ''After she's been there about 60 days, they will
never have another question.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton embraced her husband and said she is very optimistic
about the election because voters will see distinct differences
between her and her opponent, Rep. Rick Lazio, R-N.Y., as the
campaign wears on.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thank you for not only your contribution, but your vote of
confidence in the policies and the values and the vision that we
share about New York and about America,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd presented the president with a birthday cake with a
saxophone on it and sang ''Happy Birthday'' to him. He turns 54 on
Aug. 19.

<HEADLINE> BC-NY--Landfill Hearings,0686  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN KEKIS
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARCY, N.Y. (AP) - A crowd of about 500 people from rural
northern Oneida County, many of them service veterans, jammed a
college auditorium Thursday night for a public hearing on a plan to
develop a landfill they don't want.
</P>
<P>
   So many showed up that two closed-circuit television monitors
were set up outside 240-seat Kunsela Hall at SUNY Institute of
Technology so everyone could see the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   And nobody who commented to Edward Buhrmaster, an administrative
law judge from the New York State Department of Environmental
Conservation, minced words. From State Assemblyman David Townsend
to Vietnam veteran Bob Willson, the message was the same: Dump the
dump.
</P>
<P>
   ''Who in their right mind would put a landfill there in such a
pristine, environmentally sensitive area?'' Townsend asked to a
standing ovation, one of many during the evening session. ''If the
site is so good, so great, why are environmental waivers being
sought?''
</P>
<P>
   At issue is a permit needed by the Oneida County Waste Authority
from the DEC to develop the landfill, which would handle trash from
Oneida and Herkimer counties. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers also
was present to review testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The landfill would be built in the town of Ava, about 45 miles
northeast of Syracuse in a sparsely populated area of cornfields,
hayfields, woodlands and dairy farms. And it would be right next to
Veterans Memorial Forest, 798 acres of reforested land that was
dedicated in 1953 to service veterans by a nearby Veterans of
Foreign Wars post.
</P>
<P>
   ''If this landfill in this place does not offend our cultural
values, then our cultural values are broken indeed,'' said Michael
Gerrard, an attorney representing the town of Ava.
</P>
<P>
   The dump would be able to accept up to 220,000 tons of trash
each year and would be 800 feet from the edge of the veterans'
forest. It is projected to rise some 125 feet in the air before it
reaches capacity over six decades. That's twice as high as the
trees in the forest, critics said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest concerns voiced at the evening session was
the prospect of a dramatic increase in truck traffic in the area,
which receives more than 220 inches of snow a year. More than 120
trucks a day would travel to and from the dump, which would be
located on State Route 294, a hilly, seven-mile, two-lane highway
with virtually no shoulder for disabled vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   With buses from four area schools making 50 trips a day down the
highway, Ian Klingbail, an emergency medical technician and fire
department captain, was so concerned about a possible truck-school
bus accident that he showed a series of slides of the roadway in a
summer setting to paint a telling picture.
</P>
<P>
   ''Imagine that in whiteout conditions,'' Klingbail said. ''My
concern is not only with the condition of the route, but also with
the distance we are from a major hospital. It takes at least an
hour to make the trip, and we can only transport a maximum of eight
people at a time with minor injuries, and only four with major
injuries.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the biggest indictment of the permit process was
delivered by Oneida County Legislator Pamela Mandryck, who
apologized to residents in an emotional address.
</P>
<P>
   ''Environmental justice has not been achieved,'' said Mandryck,
who once represented Ava but was redistricted out after the
landfill was first proposed in 1991. ''I believe the site was
selected because of the limited education of the residents, their
financial background, and their insignificant political value. They
were an easy target.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe not so easy.
</P>
<P>
   ''They've been caught in all their lies,'' 71-year-old Lois
Mathis said during a break. ''Who do they think we are, a bunch of
dummies just because we live in Ava?''
</P>
<P>
   Anti-dump sentiment was so strong that landfill opposition
leaders had hoped for a 1,000-vehicle caravan to descend upon the
two hearings conducted Thursday. Although turnout was impressive,
the massive caravan never happened.

<HEADLINE> Man Executed in Oklahoma  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   McALESTER, Okla. (AP) -- A former truck driver who lured his
victims by impersonating a police officer was executed Thursday for
the deaths of two Arkansas teens.
</P>
<P>
   George Kent Wallace, 59, was given a lethal dose of drugs at the
Oklahoma State Penitentiary.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace pleaded guilty in 1991 in the deaths of William Von Eric
Domer, 15, of Fort Smith, Ark., and Mark Anthony McLaughlin, 14, of
Van Buren, Ark.
</P>
<P>
   The teens' bodies were discovered almost four years apart -- in
1987 and 1990 -- in the same pond just across the state line in
Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace also confessed to killing two men in North Carolina --
Jeffrey Lee Foster in 1976 and Thomas Stewart Reed in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   He was suspected in the death of another boy in Arkansas and had
indicated he would meet with authorities about the death of
12-year-old Alonzo Don Cade of Fort Smith, but later decided
against it. The boy's body was found in 1990 in a pond.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace was arrested after an 18-year-old supermarket employee
managed to escape after being stabbed in the back and arm.
</P>
<P>
   The man, now 28, told police Wallace had said he was a police
officer and was arresting him. He said Wallace put him in handcuffs
and leg irons, then drove him to a pond and attacked him. He
managed to escape by leaping into the car and driving away.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace's execution was the 11th this year in Oklahoma, the most
in a year since the state executed 14 men in 1933.

<HEADLINE> Lawyer Says Irvin Innocent  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE CRISSEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- Michael Irvin is innocent, his attorney said
Thursday, a day after the retired Cowboys receiver was arrested at
a north Dallas apartment on a misdemeanor marijuana possession
charge.
</P>
<P>
   ''The marijuana was not his, he did not possess any marijuana,''
Howard Shapiro said. ''What their (the FBI's) timing was and what
they hoped to accomplish, I have no idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro said he was contacted by Irvin on Wednesday evening
following his release from jail in the north Dallas suburb of
Plano. He had been arrested on a charge of misdemeanor possession
of marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   Irvin had not been formally charged with the Class B misdemeanor
in Collin County as of Thursday afternoon. Maximum punishment on
the charge is a $2,000 fine and 180 days in jail.
</P>
<P>
   FBI spokeswoman Lori Bailey said law enforcement officers from a
North Texas drug task force arrested Irvin in the apartment while
serving a routine warrant for Rhonda Adaham, a woman wanted for
violating her bond on a May drug arrest.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of finding Adaham, police found Irvin and her
sister, Nelly Adaham. They also found what Irvin described Thursday
as ''a roach, a half a joint (marijuana cigarette).''
</P>
<P>
   Bailey said Rhonda Adaham's whereabouts remained unknown
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Rhonda Adaham was indicted by a federal grand jury May 11 on
charges of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute heroin
and cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   According to a federal arrest affidavit, she was arrested May 17
along with 21 others as part of a nationwide sting to break up two
heroin and cocaine rings that were importing drugs from California
and Mexico for distribution throughout North Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro declined to discuss what Irvin was doing in the
apartment or his relationship with Nelly Adaham.
</P>
<P>
   ''The charge is not being at an apartment, and what he was doing
at the apartment was none of my business and not anyone else's,''
Shapiro said. ''I don't want to make more out of this than it
already is.''
</P>
<P>
   It is the second time in less than five years Irvin has faced
drug charges.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, he pleaded no contest to second-degree felony cocaine
possession in exchange for four years of deferred probation, a
$10,000 fine and dismissal of misdemeanor marijuana possession
charges from the same incident. The terms included 800 hours of
community service.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL also suspended him for five games.
</P>
<P>
   He finished his deferred probation on the charge July 6, four
days before announcing his retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Irvin, who won three Super Bowls with the Cowboys, retired July
10 after seriously injuring his neck Oct. 10 in a game at
Philadelphia. He was hired to work on the Sunday pregame show on
Fox Sports Net.
</P>
<P>
   Irvin caught 750 passes for 11,904 yards in his career. At the
time of his final play, both figures ranked ninth in NFL history.
Of the players ahead of him, only Jerry Rice had as many Super Bowl
rings.

<HEADLINE> New Chinese Officials for Taiwan  </HEADLINE>
By JOE McDONALD
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- Amid a flurry of overtures by Taiwan, China has
reshuffled its office that deals with the island, naming an army
general and a Harvard-educated bureaucrat to top posts, according
to a government official and news reports.
</P>
<P>
   The changes could indicate a new approach by communist leaders
to Taiwan, which has been ruled separately since a civil war that
ended in 1949. They have so far rebuffed offers by Taiwan's newly
elected president of high-level contacts.
</P>
<P>
   Zhou Mingwei, head of the Shanghai Foreign Affairs Office, left
this week to become deputy director of the Taiwan Affairs Office in
Beijing, an official in his office confirmed Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Maj. Gen. Wang Zaixi will fill another of the office's three
deputy director posts, according to Taiwanese news reports. A
spokesman for the Chinese office would not confirm the reports.
</P>
<P>
   Wang, who has been working at a think tank specializing in
Taiwan affairs, replaces Wang Yonghai, who is retiring, the
Taiwanese reports said. There was no indication of other possible
changes in the office.
</P>
<P>
   China and Taiwan have not had high-level contacts since 1995,
when Beijing broke off talks in a fury over a U.S. visit by the
island's then president, Lee Teng-hui. Beijing accused Lee of
preparing to declare formal independence.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's successor, Chen Shui-bian, has made several offers of new
contacts since his inauguration in May. China has demanded that
Chen first agree that the Beijing government has sovereignty over
the island.
</P>
<P>
   The new appointments in the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State
Council, China's cabinet, suggest Beijing wants to revitalize its
activities. But the backgrounds of the two men picked gave
conflicting indications of the direction any policy initiatives
might take.
</P>
<P>
   Zhou, who is in his 40s, represents a cosmopolitan generation of
younger Chinese officials. He speaks fluent English and attended
Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government. He has extensive
experience dealing with foreign companies in Shanghai, which has a
large Taiwanese business community.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Wang represents the People's Liberation Army, the
most nationalistic arm of government and one that favors a harder
line toward Taiwan. It has openly threatened the island, holding
war games nearby and firing missiles into the sea.
</P>
<P>
   The changes come just as Chen, the Taiwanese leader, is to leave
Sunday on an official trip to Central America and Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing has criticized the United States for giving him a visa
for a stopover in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The two-week trip includes stops in Dominica, Nicaragua, Costa
Rica, Gambia, Burkina Faso and Chad. They are among the 29 nations
that maintain diplomatic relations with Taiwan instead of China.

<HEADLINE> Conservation Law Loophole Examined  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration proposed Thursday
closing a perceived loophole in the Clean Water Act in an effort to
protect thousands of acres of environmentally valuable wetlands
across the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal would clarify current conservation regulations to
stop earth-moving activities such as ditch-digging and in-stream
mining that damage wetlands, which filter the nation's water
supply.
</P>
<P>
   ''Due to a legal loophole that has been exploited, an additional
20,000 acres of wetlands have been lost in this country over the
last two years,'' said EPA Administrator Carol M. Browner.
</P>
<P>
   The situation was created when the National Mining Association
challenged a 1993 EPA rule change in the wetland permit process,
administered by the Army Corps of Engineers. Court decisions in
1997 and 1998 sided with the trade organization.
</P>
<P>
   Conservation groups lauded the EPA's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''Limiting this loophole should protect the streams and wetlands
that are home to thousands of birds, fish and other wildlife,''
said Robin Mann, head of Sierra Club's National Wetlands Committee.
''Streams and marshes protect our communities by acting as a
natural sponge, soaking up water that would otherwise flood our
neighborhoods. The Sierra Club applauds the EPA and Army Corps of
Engineers for working to protect wildlife habitat and our
communities.''
</P>
<P>
   Previously, the administration had announced a Clean Water
Action Plan aimed at an annual net gain of 100,000 acres of
wetlands beginning in 2005 through wetlands restoration programs.
