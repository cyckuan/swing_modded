<HEADLINE> Turkey Seizes 165 Kilograms of Hashish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Turkish police and gendarme
soldiers seized 165 kilograms of hashish in a recent operation in
eastern Turkey, the semi-official Anatolia News Agency reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted a statement issued by the office of Bitlis
governor as saying that the gendarme soldiers disguised as drug
buyers bargained with drug smuggler Felemez Aslan in Mutki town of
Bitlis province. However, Aslan found the drug buyers as
government troops and managed to flee in the dark.
</P>
<P>
The government troops searched some places in the town and
found the 165 kilograms of hashish in 10 bags, said the
statement. But it failed to give the date when the drug was
seized.
</P>
<P>
The gendarme soldiers had staged operations in search of
Felemez Aslan in the region, according to the statement.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the Turkish police seized 4.4 tonnes of heroin,
accounting for 40 percent of the world's total haul, 12.3 tonnes
of hashish, 233 kilograms of opium, 13 kilograms of cocaine and
1,157 kilograms of base morphine.

HELSINKI, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Azerbaijan's Foreign Minister
Hassan Hassanov said today that Azerbaijan hopes to join the
Council of Europe (CE). the European Union (EU) and NATO, said
reports reaching here from Baku, capital of Azerbaijan.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the Finnish "Helsingin Sanomat" in Baku, Hassanov
said, Azerbaijan hopes to join the CE in the near future, although
NATO membership may not come as soon for the country.
</P>
<P>
The "western" policies it has chosen have saddened its
neighbors Iran and Russia, he said, nevertheless, as an
independent nation, Azerbaijan will not be affected by any sphere
of influence in its foreign affairs.
</P>
<P>
On Azerbaijan's economic development, Hassanov wishes foreign
countries to increase their investment in its oil industry to help
create job opportunities and achieve prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Without giving up its oriental cultural background, he noted,
Azerbaijan hopes to pipe its crude oil to the West European

<HEADLINE> Iran Against US Move to Disintegrate Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Parliament Speaker Ali
Akbar Nateq Nouri said here today that Tehran is against any move
by the United States to disintegrate Iraq.
</P>
<P>
According to the Iranian official news agency IRNA, Nouri
made the remarks in a meeting with head of Cuban parliamentary
delegation Juan Hererra Machado.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iran supports Iraq's territorial integrity and
independent sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Nouri said the United States should understand that it cannot
impose its domestic legislation on the international community.
</P>
<P>
Terming the U.S. presence in the Persian Gulf as a threat to
the regional security, Nouri said that the Persian Gulf should
be protected by the regional states and the U.S. and other
foreign forces should be withdrawn from the region.
</P>
<P>
Iran supports peace and security in the Persian Gulf and the
entire world, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the Middle East peace process, Nouri said the
process aimed to destroy the Palestinian nation, adding that "a
lasting peace will be established when the Palestinian nation,
either Muslims, Jews or Christians come together to form a
national government."
</P>
<P>
Describing the relations between Tehran and Havana as
"excellent," Nouri said the two countries have always confronted
the U.S. provocations aimed at undermining the Non-Aligned
Movement (NAM).
</P>
<P>
He called on the NAM member states to exercise coordination
and solidarity to foil the U.S. attempt to weaken the movement.
</P>
<P>
Machado appreciated Iran's support for Cuba in the
international forums, saying that Cuba will always stand by the
Islamic Revolution of Iran.
</P>
<P>
He expressed pleasure with the current political relations
between the two countries and called for further development of
economic cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine to Repair Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine is considering repairing
the ill-fated Chernobyl nuclear power plant as it collected enough
money at a recent fund-raising conference, Ukrainian President
Leonid Kuchma said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference here, Kuchma said Ukraine would
invest the funds into building a new shelter over the No. 4
reactor.
</P>
<P>
Blown up in 1986, sending radioactive cloud over a large part
of Europe, the reactor fell out to be the worst nuclear accident
in history.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma disclosed that his country raised 39 million dollars at
the conference held in New York on November 20 with the
participation of over 40 countries.
</P>
<P>
"This sum plus the 300 million dollars pledged by the Group of
Seven industrialized nations and Ukraine's contribution of 50
million dollars is adequate for repairing the reactor," Kuchma
noted.
</P>
<P>
However, international experts estimate that it needs 750
million dollars to repair the entire plant.
</P>
<P>
Participants of the conference realized the Chernobyl
catastrophe is not only a problem for Ukraine or Europe but a
problem for the whole world, he said.

<HEADLINE> Britain Pledges to Tackle International Terrorism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 24 (Xinhua) -- British Home Secretary Jack
Straw today promised to strengthen his efforts in cracking down on
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Responding to accusations by Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
that Britain was harboring terrorists, Straw said, "Tackling
international terrorism is a top priority for this government."
</P>
<P>
"We already have tough anti-terrorism laws and we intend to
strengthen these further," he said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak on Sunday criticized some countries, including Britain,
for sheltering fugitive Muslim militants and said they encouraged
attacks such as last week's massacre in Luxor of 58 foreign
tourists.
</P>
<P>
However, Straw's Home Office (interior ministry) has denied
Britain granted asylum to convicted terrorists, saying asylum was
only ever granted on the grounds established under the United
Nations' 1951 convention on refugees.
</P>
<P>
Straw last month pledged to overhaul Britain's anti-terrorism
laws, which currently do not make plotting to commit guerrilla
attacks abroad an offense.
</P>
<P>
Britain has come under attack in recent years from Tunisia,
Saudi Arabia and Israel, which have accused it of sheltering
guerrillas.

JOHANNESBURG, November 24 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela will hold talks with his Namibian counterpart Sam
Nujoma in Cape Town on Wednesday, a presidential spokesman Parks
Mankahlana said today.
</P>
<P>
Mandela and Nujoma will discuss matters of common interest,
including bilateral and regional issues, Mankahlana said.
</P>
<P>
There is a general realization among Southern African
Development Community (SADC) member states of the need for
greater cooperation between governments, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Mandela currently chairs the SADC.
</P>
<P>
Namibia, along with other SADC members such as Zimbabwe, is
critical of South Africa's economic dominance in the region and
has accused it of being too protectionist.
</P>
<P>
In August, Namibia accused South Africa of having designed
measures to hamper industrial development in the Southern African
Custom Union area in order to protect South African industries.
</P>
<P>
Namibia is also critical of South Africa's attempt to
negotiate a preferential trade agreement with the European Union,
which it fears, may be detrimental to its interests and those of
other SADC member states.
</P>
<P>
Another thorny issue is the disagreement between Mandela and
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe on who should chair the SADC
organ on politics, defense and security, which came to a head at
the recent SADC heads of state summit in Malawi.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The global influence of drug
cartels has become a threat to the socio-economic and political
order of countries in the world, Zimbabwe's Home Affairs Minister
Dumiso Dabengwa said today.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at a five-day Southern African Development
Community (SADC) workshop on illicit drug trafficking held in
Nyanga in east Zimbabwe. He said that the activities of drug
cartels could threaten the ability of governments to assert their
authority and to maintain order in their countries.
</P>
<P>
"The people involved in the illicit drug trade and the
organized crime groups have little respect for our laws and for
the lives of our people," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said drug cartels are motivated by financial greed and they
had grown through bribing the weak and corrupting the innocent.
</P>
<P>
"Drug trafficking and abuse are beginning to pose serious
problems in Zimbabwe and in most of the SADC countries," the
minister said.
</P>
<P>
The workshop is being attended by participants from the SADC
region.
</P>
<P>
Dabengwa stressed the need for the countries in the region to
tighten their boundaries and take other effective steps to
curb drug trafficking and abuses.

<HEADLINE> Nepal Stresses Need for New Treaty With India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Nepali Foreign Minister
Kamal Thapa today once again stressed the need for a new treaty
with India to replace the 1950 Indo-Nepal treaty, the official RSS
news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Thapa raised the issue when addressing a
briefing-and-orientation program organized by the Institute of
Foreign Affairs for some Nepalese ambassadors.
</P>
<P>
During a visit to India in mid-September, Thapa had officially
proposed to New Delhi that the Peace and Friendship Treaty be
replaced with a new one.
</P>
<P>
Thapa told the ambassadors that Kalapani in far-western Nepal
belongs to Nepal and the Indian army should be withdrawn from
there. Talks are underway with India on the issue, and if the
demand is vindicated, India will leave Kalapani, he said.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of Bhutanese refugees, Thapa said his government
aims to solve the problem by fostering relations with Bhutan on
the basis of goodwill, confidence and mutual understanding.
</P>
<P>
Nepal will not internationalize the issue, but ambassadors
should regularly inform the countries where they are posted about
the developments in this connection, he said.
</P>
<P>
About 100,000 Bhutanese refugees have been staying in eastern
Nepal in eight U.N.-run camps after being forced to flee Bhutan in
1989 and the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Thapa also stressed that the economic diplomacy being pursued
by Nepal should give priority to trade, foreign investment and
tourism.
</P>
<P>
Thapa was named foreign minister in mid-June and retained the
post after the government led by Surya Bahadur Thapa took office
in early October.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe today joined the
world nations in launching the anti-AIDS campaign as the
incidence of HIV/AIDS escalates, especially among young people.
</P>
<P>
The campaign was launched under the theme "children living in
a world with AIDS" in an effort to highlight the plight of
children who have become vulnerable due to increased cases of
child abuse.
</P>
<P>
Officially launching the campaign here, Zimbabwe's first lady
Grace Mugabe challenged every Zimbabwean to make a firm
commitment to curbing the spread of the pandemic.
</P>
<P>
She said the number of orphans who were losing their parents
to AIDS and ended up looking after themselves were on the
increase as most relatives could not take care of them.
</P>
<P>
"I appeal to all Zimbabweans to unite in condemning,
confronting and stamping out the evil of HIV positive
perpetrators who traumatize children and cut short their lives,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
"Appropriate behavior based on good old morality and
self-respect is the surest and cheapest long term solution to the
problem of AIDS," said Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
Health and Child Welfare Minister Timothy Stamps called on
parents to speak frankly about the dangers of HIV/AIDS to their
children.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe has one of the highest number of HIV infected people
in Africa. Of Zimbabwe's 12.4 million people, it is estimated
that most of the 10 percent infected with the HIV virus that
causes AIDS are those in the productive age group.
</P>
<P>
Statistics shows that there is an increasing number of
reported AIDS cases among the 15 to 19 years age group, with
girls constituting about 80 percent of HIV infections in this age
group.

<HEADLINE> UN Chief Recommends to Extend Mandate of UNPREDEP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 24 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan today recommended extending the mandate of the United
Nations Preventive Deployment Force(UNPREDEP) in the formal
Yugoslav Republic of Madedonia by an additional period of six
months until May 31, 1998.
</P>
<P>
In his report to the Security Council, Annan said over the
past five years, UNPREDEP has successfully contributed to
preventing the spillover of conflicts elsewhere in the region
into the republic.
</P>
<P>
Annan said UNPREDEP has promoted dialogue among the various
political forces and ethnic communities, provided humanitarian
assistance to the local population and helped to initiate a number
of development projects which have contributed to enhancing social
integration and national capacity as well as institution-building.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief said peace and stability in the former
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia continue to depend largely on
development in other parts of the region. In this connection,
concerns have emerged over the uncertainty of the outcome of the
presidential elections in Serbia and the possible repercussion
that may bring into the area.
</P>
<P>
The Secretary-General said increased violence in Kosovo has
also raised fears of a spillover effect on ethnic Albanians in
the host country, and the slow progress in implementing the
civilian aspects of the Dayton Peace Accords in Bosnia and
Herzegovian, particularly in the Republika Srpska, has
underscored the need for a longer-term commitment by the
international community in that country.

<HEADLINE> US Ambassador Urges Global Efforts to Eradicate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 12 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Ambassador to Egypt Edward
Walker today called for concerting international efforts to
eradicate terrorist activities.
</P>
<P>
Walker issued the call after his meeting with Arab League
Secretary General Esmat Abdul Meguid on the occasion of the end of
his four-year term as ambassador to Egypt.
</P>
<P>
He said that his talks with Meguid tackled the threats of
terrorism, citing the recent massacre in southern Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Islamic militants killed 58 foreign tourists and four Egyptians
before they were gunned down by the security police in front of an
ancient temple in Luxor, about 500 kilometers south of Cairo, on
November 17.
</P>
<P>
Walker said joint efforts can be exerted to stem that kind of
activity as it is a common enemy to Egypt, the United States and
all the countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
Walker said he also discussed with Meguid the current
developments in the region, especially those related to the peace
process, but they did not deal in detail with the latest
developments in the Iraq-U.N. crisis.
</P>
<P>
However, he said both of them agreed that diplomacy played a
key role in handling the crisis and setting matters on the right
course.
</P>
<P>
Walker, who represented the U.S. in the United Nations and in
the United Arab Emirates during the 1991 Gulf War, will become
U.S. ambassador to Israel if confirmed by the Congress.
</P>
<P>
The ambassadorial reshuffle comes after Martin Indyk, the
former U.S. ambassador to Israel, took the position of assistant
secretary of state for Near East affairs, leaving the crucial
ambassadorial position vacant during a period of increasingly
strained relations between Israel and the U.S..
</P>
<P>
Walker, a proponent of the privatization of Egypt's state-owned
companies, is being hailed by the Egyptian government and members
of the private sector as one of Egypt's most successful foreign
ambassadors because of his involvement in bringing U.S. companies
to invest in Egypt's markets.
</P>
<P>
Daniel Kurtzer, a Jew, was nominated as U.S. new ambassador to
Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Kurtzer has been a foreign service officer for 21 years,
including two years in the U.S. Embassy in Cairo, and served as
secretary for political affairs at the American Embassy in Tel
Aviv.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Ambassador praises Closer Asian-African </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Many Asian countries are
emerging as development partners for African countries with a
large participation of individual entrepreneurs from both
continents.
</P>
<P>
Japanese ambassador to Zimbabwe Asao Tsukahara made the statement
here at the opening session of a five-day regional workshop on
trade and investment diversification organized by the U.N.
Conference on Trade and Development.
</P>
<P>
"Given the rapid pace of economic liberalization and
globalization, the competitiveness of African countries could be
further enhanced through the maximum use of networking with
counterparts in Asian countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
Networking, he said, is a continuing process of bringing about
personal contacts and connections based on mutual understanding
and trust.
</P>
<P>
He added exports from Africa to Asia had increased
substantially from 1.6 billion U.S. Dollars in 1980 to 4.4
billion U.S. Dollars in 1995.
</P>
<P>
He said, "at the end of the day, I am sure that insights of
the participants will be further deepened into the challenges and
opportunities for Asia-Africa linkages and collaboration through
trade and investment."

<HEADLINE> Cypriot Government to Accept UN Procedure: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The Cypriot government will
accept any procedure the U.N. considers proper for a settlement
to the Cyprus problem, a government spokesman said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at his daily press briefing, government spokesman
Manolis Christofides said the methodology and procedure followed
during the peace talks between the two Cypriot communities in the
U.S. and Switzerland in July and August had been chosen by the
U.N. Secretary-General and "it's not for us to say if they were
wrong."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman was commenting on statements made at a press
conference in Nicosia last Friday by U.N. Secretary-General's
Special Advisor on Cyprus Diego Cordovez that the methodology he
had used in the summer peace talks was wrong.
</P>
<P>
Cordovez chaired the two rounds of direct talks between
Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash in July and August, but the talks produced no results.
</P>
<P>
"It is not the methodology that is to blame, but the lack of
goodwill and the intransigence the Turkish side continues to
show in every round of peace talks," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
What is important today, he added, is that the U.N. is
planning to begin new and decisive negotiations immediately after
the Cyprus's presidential elections in February 1998.
</P>
<P>
"We are prepared to follow the procedure which the U.N. will
propose," Christofides said, adding that the Cypriot government
is willing to participate in any talks and negotiations for a
Cyprus settlement.
</P>
<P>
Cordovez, who visited the island last week for the first time
since he was appointed special envoy earlier this year, has
warned that international interest in a Cyprus settlement will
end if a solution can not be found during next year's renewed
effort.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on this, Christofides said the international
interest should concentrate on the implementation of
U.N. resolutions on Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
"If this is the wish of the U.N. and influential governments,
the Cyprus resolutions can be implemented," he added.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into Greek Cypriot South and Turkish
Cypriot North since 1974 when Turkish troops landed and took
over the northern third of the island in the wake of a failed
pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.

UNITED NATIONS, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Development Programme (UNDP)'s Emergency Response Division is
contributing 200,000 U.S. dollars to help Somalia combat recent
flooding, a release from UNDP said today.

An estimated 1,000 people have died, ten of thousands are
homeless and as many as 200,000 others have been affected by the
disaster.

<HEADLINE> French FM: No EU Letter Blasting Netanyahu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Visiting French Foreign
Minister Hubert Vedrine denied here today that he is bringing a
letter from the European Union (EU) assailing Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu for torpedoing the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint news conference after his meeting with his
Israeli counterpart David Levy, Vedrine said that "there is not
a letter like that and I don't know from where the information
about the letter was got."
</P>
<P>
But he said that the EU, like the United States and other
friendly countries of Israel, is worried about the deadlocked
peace talks, noting that the only way to achieve stability and
security in the Middle East is to advance the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Local media Sunday quoted diplomatic sources as saying that
Vedrine will convey a verbal message from the EU to Jerusalem,
which urges Israel to move forward the peace process and
attributes the current stalemate to Netanyahu's policies.
</P>
<P>
The sources also said that there is a consensus between
Britain, France, and Germany on this issue and British Prime
Minister Tony Blair had spelled it out to Netanyahu at their
meeting on November 13 in London.
</P>
<P>
Levy told reporters that during their meeting he briefed
Vedrine on the latest development in the Israeli-Palestinian
peace talks. He praised France for its efforts to push forward
the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Levy said that "although the peace process is difficult, there
is no alternative for it."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Israel wants to resume peace talks with
Syria, noting that real efforts should be made to break the
deadlock in Israeli-Syrian talks.

<HEADLINE> Indian Coaches Serve Tanzanian Passengers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian Railways
Corporation has received 12 out of 27 third class coaches ordered
from India, boosting its passenger service, particularly on its
central line between Dar es Salaam, Mwanza and Kigoma, local
newspaper the East African reported today.
</P>
<P>
A senior TRC official said the 12 coaches were delivered last
month and the rest are expected to arrive shortly.
</P>
<P>
The newly received coaches will bring the number of TRC's
serviceable coaches to 61, alleviating the hardship passengers
have been facing in catching trains to the capital and other
urban centers.
</P>
<P>
The coach shortage had been worsened by a TRC requirement
which outlawed standing passengers on any of its train services.
The corporation runs regular passenger services on the Dar es
Salaam-Tabora main line which branches off at Tabora to Mwanza on
Lake Victoria and to Kigoma on Lake Tanganyika.
</P>
<P>
Stiff competition from bus companies has shut out the
corporation's shuttle service on the Dar es Salaam-Moshi and Dar
es Salaam-Tanga lines. The additional coaches, say TRC officials,
may not greatly change the situation, but it will improve the
company's ability to compete with the bus companies.
</P>
<P>
The delivery of the coaches come eight months after the
corporation received 67 fuel tank wagons under a European Union
grant which also included the offer of the coaches.

<HEADLINE> African Women Urged to Enhance Role in Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, November 24 (Xinhua) -- African women today were
urged to unite and enhance their role in conflict resolution and
peace building activities of the continent.
</P>
<P>
The call was made by Ugandan Vice-President Specioza W.
Kazibwe in her keynote address at the opening session of a
three-day workshop on documented best practices of women in peace
building and non violent means of conflict resolution held here.
</P>
<P>
Kazibwe stressed the need for the establishment of a strong
institutional framework whereby women could come together and
intensify their struggle against all sorts of violence affecting
themselves and the general public.
</P>
<P>
Women's initiatives during the process of peace building,
conflict prevention and resolution could not bring fruitful
achievements unless backed by pertinent governmental as well as
international bodies, she said.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the session, Ethiopian Education Minister Genet
Zewdi stressed the importance of empowerment of African women,
saying that women's access to decision making activities is the best
approach to conflict resolution and peace building progresses
both at the grass-roots and community levels.
</P>
<P>
She said conflict and violence usually surface in areas where
women's right to decision making activities are violated or not
at all ensured.
</P>
<P>
Women activities drawn from Burundi, Congo, Liberia, Mali,
Rwanda, Sudan, Somali and Ethiopia as well as representatives of
government and inter-government organizations and United Nations
agencies are attending the three-day workshop.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Denies US Allegation of Obstructing UN's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Iraq today denied U.S. Defense
Secretary William Cohen's allegation that Iraqi authorities had
obstructed U.N. inspectors' access to suspected sites in Iraq, the
official Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted an official spokesman as saying that Cohen's
statement was meant to mislead the world public opinion in
preparation for straining Iraq's relationship with the
U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) in charge of dismantling Iraqi
weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
According to the INA report, the places to which U.N. weapons
inspection teams were denied access were three Saddam Hussein's
presidential buildings.
</P>
<P>
On September 27, a U.N. inspection team demanded access to a
Special Republican Military unit through a special path which did
not lead to the unit, but to a presidential building, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
During the incident, the team head was offered to be taken to
that unit through another path, but he refused and decided to
withdraw.
</P>
<P>
As a U.N. inspection team demanded access to one of the
presidential sites on September 29, a high-level Iraqi official
asked the team head to enter with him into the site. In case the
inspector find anything related to weapons of mass destruction, a
group of the team would be called in.
</P>
<P>
However, the head decided to withdraw his team under the
pretext of bad contacts with New York, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The third incident occurred on October 1 when a
U.N. inspection team demanded access to a dilapidated building at
another presidential site, which the team thought was one of the
security departments.
</P>
<P>
In that incident, a senior Iraqi official offered to accompany
the team head into that building, but the inspector refused and
decided to withdraw, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The INA report quoted the spokesman as saying that the Iraqi
side did not practically deny U.N. access to those sites, rather
it offered alternatives that were rejected by the inspectors
themselves.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that what had been mentioned above was a
cogent evidence "on the campaign of lies and facts distortion
launched by the United States against Iraq."

<P>
LONDON, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The global drugs market
continued to be dominated by the U.S. market in September, with
U.S. year-on-year growth rising to 15 percent compared with a
seven percent average growth of the world's 10 largest markets.

percent in the year to August to 15 percent in September at 66
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
However, sales in the second and third biggest markets in Japan
and Germany were stagnant, with sales standing at 43.4 billion
dollars and 14.9 billion dollars respectively.
</P>

8.8 billion, the UK at eight percent to 7.5 billion, Spain eight
percent to 4.9 billion dollars and Canada eight percent to 4.0
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Israeli Warplanes Attack Guerrillas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Israeli warplanes and
artilleries today pounded south Lebanon and the country's eastern
area of Bekka Valley as a response to guerrillas' attacks on its
outposts.
</P>
<P>
The fighting has lasted for two days since Saturday midnight
when Lebanese guerrillas fired shells on the village of Beit Lif
in the western sector of the Israeli-occupied south Lebanon,
claiming lives of nine Lebanese civilians and leaving 12 others
wounded.
</P>
<P>
At 12:20 (GMT 10:20), Israeli warplanes fired air-to-surface
missiles in the areas surrounding the village of Hania, near
the Israeli border, in which Nepalese troops base of the
United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon(UNIFIL) is located.
</P>
<P>
After less than one hour, Israeli planes blasted the areas
surrounding the villages of Majdail Zun, 99 kilometers south of
Beirut, which were believed to be often used by guerrillas as a
launching pad for operations against Israeli troops. But no
casualties were caused.
</P>
<P>
In addition to air raids, Israeli artillery also bombarded the
villages in the western part, which faces an Israeli-occupied
enclave in the south.
</P>
<P>
Guerrillas used rocket-propelled grenades, mortars and
automatic weapons to respond Israel's strike. The statement issued
by guerrillas said that they "scored direct hits" in the enemy's
positions.
</P>
<P>
Muslim guerrillas are fighting a war to dislodge Israeli and
its ally troops from the 1,200-square-kilometer area in southern
Lebanon they have occupied since 1985 with an aim to prevent
cross-border guerrilla attack upon north Israel.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese PM Ends Visit to Saudi Arabia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister
Rafik Al-Hariri wrapped up his three-day visit to Saudi Arabia
today after holding talks with Saudi leaders on bilateral and
regional issues, reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, he held talks with Saudi Crown Prince and deputy
Prime Minister Abdullah Ibn Abdul-Aziz on intensified fighting
between Muslim guerrillas and Israeli soldiers in South Lebanon
and the stalemated Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders stressed that real peace in the region can only
be achieved through returning occupied Arab lands by Israelis.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Saudi Arabia, Al-Hariri also met with Saudi
King Fahd Ibn Abdul-Aziz Sunday and discussed Arab and
international issues of mutual concern as well as bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Fahd renewed the Kingdom's stand in supporting Lebanon and the
UN Security Council resolution number 425 that calls for an
immediate and unconditional Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed on the Kingdom's support for the
land-for-peace formula in the peace process.

<HEADLINE> UAE President Arrives in Cairo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 24 (Xinhua) -- United Arab Emirates (UAE)
President Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al-Nahyan arrived here this
evening for talks with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on
breaking the Mideast peace deadlock and boosting bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak greeted his UAE counterpart at the Cairo International
Airport before accompanying him to the Qubba presidential palace
where the UAE head of state will be staying during his two-day
visit.
</P>
<P>
Other key issues they will discuss include the recent crisis
between Iraq and the United Nations and rallying Arab and Islamic
ranks, according to local media reports.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Egyptian TV broadcast today on the
occasion of his visit to Egypt, the UAE leader praised the
strong ties between Egypt and his country as "a model for what
Arab relations should be like."
</P>
<P>
He expressed optimism over the present Arab situation, but he
noted that efforts should be made to "bring us closer to each
other."
</P>
<P>
"If all Arabs had a unified stance vis-a-vis Israel, the
Palestinian cause would have been long solved," he said, calling
on Arabs to stand as one man as they share common interest and a
common destiny.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said today the talks
between the two leaders will focus on developments in the Arab

process. Issues related to the Islamic conference to be held in
Tehran in December are also on their agenda.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian head of state General
Sani Abacha and other sub-regional leaders have waded into the
disagreement between the west African peacekeeping force ECOMOG
and Liberian President Charles Taylor, a source said here today.
</P>
<P>
Taylor has reportedly threatened to expel the ECOMOG because
he does not want the force to help restructure and train the new
Liberian army as mandated by the Economic Community of West
African States (ECOWAS).
</P>
<P>
Lansana Kouyate, Executive Secretary of ECOWAS, described as
" unfortunate" the reported tension brewing between the ECOMOG and
the Liberian government, saying that there is some
misunderstanding between the two parties.
</P>
<P>
Contacts were being made at the highest level to reduce the
tension and resolve the issue, Kouyate said at a new forum here
today.
</P>
<P>
"At the end of the day, the tension would be reduced and
hopefully it would be resolved through the Abuja framework for
peace in Liberia," he added.
</P>
<P>
Kouyate, a Guinean diplomat who once served as the United
Nations assistant secretary-general in charge of political
affairs, came into the current position at the ECOWAS summit last

<HEADLINE> ECOWAS, Sierra Leone Junta to Open 2nd-Phase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The second phase of negotiation
on restoring the ousted civilian government in Sierra Leone is
expected to open soon, a senior sub-regional organization
official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Lansana Kouyate, Executive Secretary of the Economic Community
of West African States (ECOWAS), disclosed he would leave for
Freetown, Sierra Leone today to make preparations for the talks.
</P>
<P>
He said he was mandated by the ECOWAS Committee of Five on
Sierra Leone to do so and will report to the committee when he
comes back so that it can assess the situation in that country.
</P>
<P>
Normally, the negotiation will be held on November 28, said
Kouyate, a Guinean diplomat who took the post at the ECOWAS
summit last August.
</P>
<P>
The committee of five and the ruling junta in Freetown, which
seized power in the May 25 coup, had their first round talks last
month in Conakry, Guinea.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the meeting, the junta agreed to step down and
hand over to the ousted government led by President Ahmed Tejan
Kabbah in April next year.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the junta leader, Major Johnny Paul
Koroma, and the commander of the west African peacekeeping force
(ECOMOG), Major-General Victor Malu, met in Freetown to work out
modalities for the implementation of the Conakry peace accord.
</P>
<P>
But they failed to reach consensus as to whether the armed
forces of Sierra Leone should be disarmed, among other key
issues.
</P>
<P>
As peace and security are so crucial for the development of
the west African sub-region, one of the poorest region in the
world, the ECOWAS has expressed strong determination to solve the
Sierra Leone crisis, particularly after it has successfully
helped bring an end to the seven-year-old civil war in Liberia.
</P>
<P>
In this concern, "much has to be done before April next year,"
said the new ECOWAS executive secretary.

<HEADLINE> Rafsanjani Urges Formation of Political Parties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of Iran's State
Expediency Council (SEC) and former President Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani today urged the formation of political parties in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the Iranian official news agency IRNA, Rafsanjani
attributed the recent political developments concerning the power
of the country's supreme leader to the absence of political
parties in the country.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani was referring to the event that earlier this month,
a famous Iranian religious canonist, Ayatollah Hussein Ali
Mentazeri, accused Supreme Leader Ayatollah Seyed Ali Khamenei of
intervening in the government's affairs.
</P>
<P>
The remarks by Mentazeri triggered series of condemnation and
attacks from religious and political figures and organizations.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani pointed out that democracy in parallel with
existence of political parties is legally allowed in Iran.
</P>
<P>
"If a variety of political parties were not formed, democracy
would not take shape in Iran and we would have similar events in
future," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that groups have replaced the political parties, the
people belonging to these groups make statements but they do not
regard themselves responsible.
</P>
<P>
In 1981, late Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini issued
an order to dismantle political parties. There have been only
political factions and groups in the country since then.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani said the recent events over the issue of the
supreme leadership, Velayat-e Faqih (governance of supreme
religious jurisprudent), were launched by "the dirty hands of the
enemies and something which has its roots in miscalculations."
</P>
<P>
However, he stressed that exchange of views should be carried
out in a healthy atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani also denied any interference by the SEC in the
affairs of the executive and legislative branches of the
government.
</P>
<P>
According to the country's constitution, he said, the SEC
arbitrates on any dispute between the Majlis (parliament) and the
Guardians Council and provides the supreme leader with
consultations, adding that the SEC is far from any factional
tendency.

<HEADLINE> French President Defends Idea of European Manned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 24 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
today defended the idea to develop manned space flight by European
countries which he said should be let Europe catch up with the
United States as a great power in space.
</P>
<P>
"The mastering of (rocket) launchers and the manned flights
are guarantee of the status of great power" for Europe, said
Chirac during a visit to the European space center in Kourou,
French Guyana, where the Ariane space rockets are launched.
</P>
<P>
"Man in space is also the confirmation of our presence," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Chirac praised French astronaut Jean-Loup Chretien who has
joined American space flights but has been criticized at home for
supporting American space programs.
</P>
<P>
Among his critics is the Minister of National Education,
Technology and Research, Claude Allegre, who disapproves of manned
space flight.
</P>
<P>
Chirac said that Europe is cooperating with the United States,
Canada and Japan to develop a kind of spacecraft which is smaller
than the American space shuttles but capable of carrying
astronauts to space stations and bringing them back home.

<HEADLINE> Reports of Harassment of Nigerians in Liberia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's defense headquarters
today described as " false reports" about harassment of Nigerians in
Liberia by Liberian security agents.
</P>
<P>
Col. Godwin Ugbo, Acting Director of Defence Information, said
here today that the Nigerian returnees, numbered about 3,000 who
came into the country at the weekend claiming harassment, were in
fact from Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Local media reported today that the returnees are mainly
traders and artisans, and many of them looked like refugees.
</P>
<P>
Noting that there are no Nigerian refugees in Liberia, the
defense spokesman appealed to Nigerians not to confuse the
Nigeria-Liberia issue, stressing that Nigeria was not at war with
Liberia.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile Executive Secretary of the Economic Community of
West African States (ECOWAS), Lansana Kouyate, said here today
that ECOWAS Chairman General Sani Abacha and other sub-regional
leaders have waded into the disagreement between the Nigerian-led
ECOWAS peacekeeping force (ECOMOG) and Liberian President Charles
Taylor.
</P>
<P>
Kouyate described as unfortunate the reported tension brewing
between ECOMOG and the Liberian government.
</P>
<P>
Taylor stated earlier his willingness to restructure his own
armed forces as against the Abuja accord which gives such
responsibility to ECOMOG.

<HEADLINE> German Officials Differ on Jobless Outlook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Germany's federal labour office
president, Bernhard Jagoda, said today that it is still premature
to predict that the country's joblessness would surge to a new
record of five million this winter.
</P>
<P>
His remarks came after Economic Minister Guenter Rexrodt said
over the weekend that it could not be ruled out the jobless total
might reach the five-million mark occasionally.
</P>
<P>
Jagoda, however, argued that he did not expected any major
seasonal job cuts in the construction sector this winter because
of the introduction of new wage arrangements in that sector since
November 1.
</P>
<P>
In order to combat the country's already high unemployment,
which was 4.29 million in October, Jagoda repeated his call for
tax and pension reforms.
</P>
<P>
But what is also necessary are flexible working hour
regulations, more domestic investment and more innovation, he
added.

PARIS, November 24 (Xinhua) -- France's butchers have called

In a message addressed to "Ladies and Gentlemen the

time when massacres, shootings or throat-cutting take place in
reality, the word "butcher" is used to describe the perpetuators

The press uses all the time the word "butcher" to describe
authors of crimes against humanity, the serial killers or tyrants,

<P>
CAIRO, November 24 (Xinhua) -- John Garang, leader of Sudan's
largest rebel group, arrived here today for talks with Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak on the latest developments in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Addressing reporters upon his arrival, Garang said his meeting
with Mubarak is meant to expound the peace efforts by his Sudan
People's Liberation Army (SPLA).
</P>
<P>
Garang, on his first visit to Cairo, welcomed Egypt's handling
and assessment of the situation in Sudan, and its support for
peace efforts in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
He said that his Cairo trip is a good opportunity to reassure
his determination to establish peace and democracy in Sudan and to
protect the national and territorial integrity of Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Garang's visit came less than a month after Sudanese Vice
President el-Zubeir Mohammed Salih met with Mubarak here in a bid
to improve the strained ties between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Cairo and Khartoum virtually went chilled
after Egypt accused Sudan of involving in a 1995 assassination
attempt on Mubarak in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. However, Sudan denied
the charge.
</P>
<P>
The two neighbors also have disputes over the control of the
Halaib border region on the Red Sea.
</P>
<P>
The Garang-led rebel group has been fighting the Islamic
government since 1983 to press for more independence for the
southern third of Sudan. So far, it refused to sign peace treaty
with the government.
</P>
<P>
Over 1 million people have died either in the fighting or
famine in this African country during the 14-year-old civil war in
southern Sudan.

WASHINGTON, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Officials of both the
United States and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK)
will hold bilateral talks in Washington this week, the State
Department said today.
</P>
<P>
The talks will be held at the vice foreign ministers' level and
will cover "a range of issues," State Department spokesman James
Foley told reporters.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said it was likely that Charles Kartman, U.S.
deputy assistant secretary of state, will lead the U.S. delegation
while Vice Foreign Minister Kim Gye-gwan will be the head of the
DPRK delegation.
</P>
<P>
The two men were also the heads of their delegations to talks
in New York last week, which reached an agreement that the DPRK,
South Korea, the United States and China will convene a meeting in
Geneva on December 9 to discuss peace issues on the Korean
Peninsula. That is the so-called four-party talks.
</P>
<P>
The officials said issues on the agenda will likely be a
planned exchange of liaison offices and search for remains of
Americans missing from the Korean War.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time that DPRK officials at the vice foreign
minister level hold talks with their counterparts at the State
Department in Washington D.C. The two countries usually talked in

<HEADLINE> Annan Recommends to Create New UN Haitian Mission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 24 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan today recommended to create a new UN Haitian mission to
replace the United Nations Transition Mission in Haiti(UNTMIH)
which was established in August 1997 and would expire on November
30, 1997.
</P>
<P>
In his report to the Security Council, Annan said the new
mission, known as the United Nations Police Mission in Haiti
(MIPONUH) with a mandate period of six months, would be composed
of up to 290 police officers, including a 90-strong special unit.
The police personnel would continue to carry personal weapons.
</P>
<P>
Annan said the proposed mission would have its headquarters in
Port-au Prince. It would oversee the technical assistance to the
Haitian National Police founded by the United Nations Development
Program (UNDP) and would operate closely with other
international and regional organizations in the country.
</P>
<P>
The UN chief said while the Haitian National Police has made
substantial progress forward, its development into a professional
force continued to be slow and uneven. The Young police force
continued to have difficulty in dealing effectively with the
country's increasing security demands.
</P>
<P>
The Secretary-General said the Haitian National Police would
continue to need international support during the legislative
election to be held in November 1998, and the proposed mission
would allow for continued international support through the
critical election period.
</P>
<P>
Annan stressed that the Government of Haiti must prepare itself
to assume full responsibility for the further strengthening and
effective functioning of its own institutions, including the
National Police, following the election.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Open Phone Market to Foreigners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government plans to
take a major step today to open America's 200 billion-U.S.-dollar
telecommunications market to foreign competition, hoping to lower
international calling rates for consumers and offer chances for
American communications companies elsewhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times reported today that the Federal
Communications Commission will vote today to approve rules
carrying out February's World Trade Organization agreement to
liberalize international telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
The ruling will make it much easier for foreign carriers to
offer service in the United States, increasing competition and
potentially driving down prices, it said.
</P>
<P>
The commission also plans to increase to 49 percent from 25
percent the limit on how much of an American communications
carrier can be owned by foreign firms, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
For years, the F.C.C. has forced foreign carriers that want
to offer service between the United States and their home
markets to demonstrate that their native market is open to
American companies. So far only Britain, Sweden and New Zealand
have passed that test, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Under the new rules, the commission will normally allow
companies from all 132 W.T.O. nations to market to American
customers and deliver services to America's shores, it reported.
</P>
<P>
Major American long-distance companies like AT&AMP;T and the MCI
could see their share of the nation's 12 billion U.S. dollar
international calling market fall as foreign communications giants
like Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom start offering service
directly to American businesses and consumers.

<HEADLINE> Arab League: Strong Economy Key to Arab Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Arab League Secretary General
Esmat Abdel Meguid said today that building a strong Arab economic
base is the best means of protecting Arab world's security and its
civilization identity.
</P>
<P>
In his address read out at the annual conference of Assiut
University Future Studies Center, Assiut, upper Egypt, Meguid
asserted the need for forming an economic grouping to confront
challenges posed by major economic blocs.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Arabs possess capabilities and potentials
that render them capable of dealing with various blocs from a
position of power.
</P>
<P>
In his address to the conference held under the theme "Arab
Common Market and the Future of Arab Economy", Egyptian Foreign
Minister Amr Moussa said an Arab common market has become a issue
of destiny that would benefit and protect Arab interests in the
light of the current regional and international changes.
</P>
<P>
Moussa referred to present international challenges represented
mainly in the collapse of the Soviet Union and the birth of major
economic blocs and the establishment of the World Trade
Organization and systems on liberalizing world trade.
</P>
<P>
The Arab common market, a concept first formed in the 1960s,
has largely remained on the paper over the years.
</P>
<P>
According to a resolution adopted by the Arab League last year
as a prelude to the Arab common market, the beginning of 1998 will
see the establishment of the Arab Free Trade Area, followed by
gradual elimination of non-tariff and tariff barriers until
complete liberalization was reached by the end of the year 2007.

hard-earned Sino-Japanese friendship which has stood the test of a
quarter of a century.
</P>
<P>
At a ceremony held in Beijing today, Yosaku Hirasawa, an old
friend of China, presented a special gift to the Chinese people to
mark the 25th anniversary of the normalization of Sino-Japanese
diplomatic ties.
</P>
<P>
The gift includes 100 Nishiki Carp to southwestern China's
Sichuan Province, hometown of the Giant Panda, and eight
25-year-old such fish to Chinese leaders.
</P>
<P>
Just like the Giant Panda, the Nishiki Carp is viewed by the
Japanese people as their national treasure. They have been gifts
to 16 heads of state and government who visited Japan.
</P>
<P>
Because of its colorful and gentle appearance and its long life
of more than 300 years, the Japanese people view the Nishiki Carp
as a symbol of good luck and peace.
</P>
<P>
Yosaku, also a well-known entrepreneur and an expert on
aquaculture, said that peace is most important for people of the
two countries, making the fish an appropriate gift.
</P>
<P>
He said non-governmental friendly exchanges in the 1950s
and 1960s were a major part of the foundation for reforging
bilateral diplomatic ties.
</P>
<P>
Yosaku has visited Sichuan Province several times. He also
donated today 220 million Japanese Yen (1.8 million U.S. dollars)
to help the province set up a center for raising the Nishiki Carp
because of the province's suitable weather and environment.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Starts Building Multi Billion Subway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Singapore started today to
build a long-expected subway line, which will cost some 5 billion
Singapore dollars (about 3.1 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The new subway project, known here as the North-East Line (NEL)
of the Mass Rapid Transit (MRT), is the biggest and most expensive
infrastructure project in Singapore in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Singapore Minister for Communications Mah Bow Tan said at the
ground breaking ceremony today that the start of the construction
of the subway brought the Singaporeans another step closer to a
world class public transport system for Singapore.
</P>
<P>
He said that based on the new financing formula proposed by the
country's Land Transport Authority in its White Paper last year,
the government decided to proceed with the NEL and bring the line
into operation by the year 2002, four years ahead of the original
plan.
</P>
<P>
"In spite of major financial unrest and slower economic growth
in the region, we are able to proceed without interruption with
this project. This is due to the hard work of our people and the
prudence of the Government in accumulating substantial reserves
over the years," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
He said the start of the project is also a reflection of the
government's commitment to investing in the country's basic
infrastructure, in order to enhance the efficiency of Singapore's
transport network.
</P>
<P>
The NEL will run from the World Trade Center, which is located
in the southernmost part of the Singapore island, to Punggol in
the north. There will be 16 stops along the 20-kilometer subway
line.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
today chaired a meeting of the Russian Security Council to discuss
scientific personnel training and relation with Chechnya, the
Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Yeltsin urged the government to complete the
payment of dued wages and subsidies to employees of
budget-financed organizations by January 1, 1998.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Russia is lacking of a system to train personnel
for Russian science and education.
</P>
<P>
Russia's development in the next years and further depends on
how promptly and effectively this issue will be resolved, he said,
adding that "we see the preparation of personnel as part of the
national security."
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said the state of sciences in the country is directly
linked with the quality of key state decisions, "although this
sphere has not been fine-tuned."
</P>
<P>
He said he is worried about brain drain from Russia. He noted
50 out of the 100 most reputed Russian scientists have left the
country and the exodus of young promising scientists continues.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said problems of the debts repayment to sciences will
be resolved and wages of school teachers and scientists will be
raised.
</P>
<P>
Today's meeting was attended by Security Council Secretary Ivan
Rybkin, First Deputy Prime Ministers Boris Nemtsov and Anatoly
Chubais and other other officials.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, Foreign Minister Yevgeny

<HEADLINE> UAE President Urges Tolerance in Settling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 24 (Xinhua) -- United Arab Emirates (UAE)
President Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al-Nahyan today called for
"forgiveness and tolerance" in settling conflicts in the Gulf and
a lifting of sanctions imposed on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Zayed, who left here today at the end of his two-day
visit to Egypt, made the remarks during a meeting with chief
editors of Egyptian newspapers.
</P>
<P>
He called for giving Iraqi President Saddam Hussein "another
chance to prove his goodwill," saying that the Iraqi people have
suffered enough from the U.N. sanctions imposed after Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he described Saddam's reckless thrust into
neighboring Kuwait in 1990 was out of "an ambition coveting the
entire Gulf region."
</P>
<P>
The UAE president criticized attempts to drive a wedge in the
Arab ranks, citing those by Qatari Foreign Minister Sheikh Hamad
Bin Jassim Bin Jabir al-Thani who attacked Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The Qatari foreign minister on November 12 linked Egypt to an
attempted coup against the Gulf Arab state's emir, Sheikh Hamad
Bin Khalifa al-Thani, who toppled his father in a bloodless palace
coup in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Cairo has denied Qatari allegations of its involvement in the
failed coup in Doha last year and has summoned its ambassador to
Qatar for the second time in 18 days for consultations on the
growing strained relations with the small Gulf emirate.
</P>
<P>
Since his arrival here Monday evening, Sheikh Zayed had held
two round of talks with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on the
situation in the gulf region, the deadlock in the Mideast peace
process, boosting bilateral ties, and rallying Arab and Islamic
ranks, according to local media reports.
</P>
<P>
This is the second meeting between the two leaders within a
month as Mubarak visited the UAE on October 31 before heading to
Kuala Lumpur to attend the G-15 summit.
</P>
<P>
The UAE is a key trade and economic partner to Egypt. Since it
was established in 1978, the Abu Dhabi Development Fund has pumped
111 million U.S. dollars into various development projects in
Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The UAE is also providing Egypt with financial assistance to
carry out three new irrigation schemes expected to cultivate more
land.
</P>
<P>
In recognition of Sheikh Zayed's contributions to various
agricultural projects nationwide, Egypt has named a giant
irrigation canal under construction in Toshka area after the UAE
leader.

<P>
MOSCOW, November 25 (Xinhua) -- President Boris Yeltsin said
today that he will not kick away First Deputy Prime Minister
Anatoly Chubais, the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Meeting Chubais for the first time after stripping his the post
as finance minister, Yeltsin said the story with advances "is not
lawlessness and not the Criminal Code. This is a moral-ethical
problem."
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin praised the first vice-premiers, Chubais and Boris
Nemtsov for their hard working, saying that "the government will
have to reply to many questions" on December 1 when the cabinet
gives an account to him.
</P>
<P>
The president also met with Chief of the general staff of the
Russian armed forces Anatoly Kvashnin and promoted him to the rank
of general.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin commended the certain success in the military reform,
highly assessed Kvashnin's work.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Kvashnin told Yeltsin about the steps taken by
the Defense Ministry for military construction and the forming of
combat ready units of the land forces, the air force and other
services of the armed forces.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan today reiterated
that it is ready to hold the fourth round of official talks with

</P>
<P>
"It really depends on India, they have reneged on
understanding, they have to come back to Islamabad agreement," a

<P>
BRUSSELS, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU)'s

<HEADLINE> Kurdish Party Accepts Cease-fire in Northern </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Iraq's Patriotic Union of
Kurdistan (PUK) has agreed to accept an unconditional cease-fire
with its rival Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) in northern Iraq,
a PUK representative said here today.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the KDP Monday said that the KDP decided
to halt military activities as from 12:00 local time (10:00 GMT)
on November 24.
</P>
<P>
But the cease-fire is conditional upon that the PUK prevents
the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) rebels and any other
third party from carrying out military attacks against the KDP
positions or against the civilians across the cease-fire lines in
northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
PUK Representative Shazad Saib in Turkey told Xinhua that "the
PUK has not supported the PKK and there is no any PKK militant in
our region," saying that the PUK agreed to accept the "cease-fire
without any condition."
</P>
<P>
Last Wednesday, Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman Necati Utkan
accused the PUK of provoking the recent clashes with the KDP in
northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Ankara has repeatedly blamed the PUK for close ties with the
PKK, an outlawed militant group, which has been fighting a
13-year-old war for autonomy in eastern and southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the pro-Iranian PUK and the PKK
launched a joint military offensive against the KDP on October 13
and the KDP launched a counter-offensive on November 8, regaining
all lands lost to the PUK and PKK.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Anatolia News Agency today quoted a KDP radio report
as saying that the KDP forces killed 13 PUK militants in the
clashes in Dolaros region of northern Iraq on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The KDP and the PUK, two Kurdish factions, have been fighting
each other for the control of northern Iraq following the 1991
Gulf War, when Iraqi President Saddam Hussein was rendered
ineffectively by allied forces.

BEIJING, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Tibet High School in the

</P>
<P>
The boarding school was set up in 1987 in response to the
Central government's call for assistance to the Tibet Autonomous

<HEADLINE> SMEs to Play Vital Role in EU Jobs Creation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The small and medium-sized
enterprises (SMEs) in Europe will play an important role in the
creation of jobs in the long run, said a report here today.
</P>
<P>
The fifth annual report of the European Observatory for SMEs
was presented today at a conference organized by the European
Commission, the European Union (EU)'s executive body.
</P>
<P>
The report provides an overview of the current situation
and perspectives of SMEs in all member states of the European
Economic Area and Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
It said that the employment growth, if there is going to be
any, will mainly come from the SMEs.
</P>
<P>
The report "is published at a moment when both the Commission
and the member states are intensifying their efforts for the
implementation of an integrated and coherent strategy in favor of
employment," said Christos Papoutsis, commissioner responsible for
enterprise policy.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of EU member countries approved a total of 19
guidelines for jobs creation across the EU at the jobs summit held
in Luxembourg on November 20-21, which emphasized the importance
of SMEs and enterpreneurship in jobs creation.
</P>
<P>
Papoutsis added that SMEs and the development of a new business
culture could "play a vital role" in tackling the problem of
unemployment.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his determination to strengthen the policies which
would help the EU create the new business mentality and a new
business environment so that the SMEs will become more competitive
and create the new jobs needed by Europe.
</P>
<P>
About one million new enterprises are started in the EU each
year. On average, a European enterprise provides employment for
six persons, said the report, which was prepared by the European
Network for SME Research.
</P>
<P>
However, the report said that employment created by new
enterprise is rather unstable, as failure rates of new businesses
are quite high.

<P>
STOCKHOLM, November 25 (Xinhua)-- Sweden and Russia are making
preparations for the forthcoming visit to Sweden by Russian
president Boris Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
A Russian delegation, headed by Vice Chairman of the Russian
Security Council Jurij Deriabin, met Swedish Defense Minister
Bjoern von Sydow and Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs
Jan Eliasson Monday, newspapers reported today.
</P>
<P>
Deriabin said that the Yeltsin's scheduled visit to Sweden
shows how important Sweden is to Russia and vice versa. He
emphasized that Russia supports the idea of the Baltic Sea region
as a new center of development in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin irked the Baltic countries and Sweden by having
proposed for increased security in Northern Europe and Russia to
provide security guarantees to these countries.
</P>
<P>
Deriabin said that the proposal has been misunderstood.
</P>
<P>
"It is not only about security guarantees but above all about
security-forming measures to reduce tension between Russia and the
Baltic states," he said.
</P>
<P>
On Monday's discussions on the preparations for Yeltsin's
visit, Eliasson said that they had been conducted in a very good
tone.
</P>
<P>
Sweden wished to create a security policy network with Russia
and all the other countries in this region, he said.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea, Japan Continue Fishery Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, November 25 (Xinhua) -- South Korea and Japan will open
three days of fishery talks here on Wednesday to settle
differences over revising the 1965 bilateral fishing accord.
</P>
<P>
South Korean Foreign Minister Yoo Chong-ha and his Japanese
counterpart, Keizo Obuchi, agreed to hold the talks when they met
last week in Vancouver, Canada, a foreign ministry spokesman said
today.
</P>
<P>
A two-day meeting on Japan's unilaterally declared straight
base line also opened here today, with delegations led by the
deputy director generals of the two foreign ministries present.
</P>
<P>
The fishery talks, the seventh this year, will focus on how to
map out a temporary revision to the current fishery agreement and
how to guarantee the vested fishing rights of one country in the
other's waters, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Such a provisional approach is aimed at preventing overlapping
claims to sovereignty over rocky islets in the middle of the sea
between them.
</P>
<P>
The talks come after Seoul expressed eagerness for an early
conclusion of a revised fishing accord.
</P>
<P>
Yoo Chong-ha said in Seoul last week that South Korea is ready
to conclude a new fishing agreement with Japan as early as the end
of the year.
</P>
<P>
However, Yoo said Seoul would accept a new fishing accord with
Japan providing it does not harm its sovereignty over the Tokdo
islets (Takeshima in Japanese), and the existing rights of the
South Korean fishermen.

<HEADLINE> 20 African States Face Food Shortage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Twenty African countries
continue to face exceptional food emergencies due to adverse
weather conditions and, in some cases, civil strife, according to
a U.N. report reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
Food shortage is particularly acute in Sierra Leone, eastern
Africa and the Great Lakes region, said the latest report on the
continent's food supply situation and crop prospects issued by
the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).
</P>
<P>
It says a severe drought at the beginning of this year
substantially reduced second-season food production in Kenya,
Tanzania, Uganda, Somalia and large parts of southern Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, late or erratic rainfall later this year have led
to reduced main-season harvest in Tanzania, Uganda and Kenya
where the cereal production will fall by 30, 27 and 22 percent
respectively compared to 1996, the report estimated.
</P>
<P>
The Tanzanian government estimates that about three million
people are facing severe food shortages and has recently appealed
for 76,000 tons of emergency food aid.
</P>
<P>
In Ethiopia, despite an overall satisfactory food supply
situation, it is officially estimated that some 4.6 million
people are in need of food aid.
</P>
<P>
Food supply is tight throughout Somalia where farmers' stocks
are exhausted after three consecutive poor harvests.
</P>
<P>
In the Great Lakes region, despite the easing of refugee
crisis, serious food difficulties persist, largely as a result of
major population dislocations, continuing insecurity and
unfavorable weather in some areas, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The food situation in Sierra Leone has continued to
deteriorate since the coup in May. Food prices have increased
sharply and serious food shortages are reported.
</P>
<P>
There are currently more than 92,000 internally displaced
people in Sierra Leone, up from about 65,000 before the coup.
</P>
<P>
The level of the cereal import requirement in sub-Saharan
Africa in 1997/98 is likely to be higher than in the previous
year, the report concluded.

<HEADLINE> 15 Coffee Plants Closed in Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Uganda Coffee Development
Authority (UCDA) has closed 15 coffee plants in Jinja and Kamuli
districts east of the country, The Monitor reported today.
</P>
<P>
These plants are blamed for processing wet coffee for export,
which will affect the coffee quality, the report added.
</P>
<P>
Jamds Juswata, a UCDA technical officer who is in charge of
the operation, said some plants had no licenses for operation,
and some were maize plants which failed to meet the standard for
coffee processing.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, UCDA had closed another 15 coffee plants in Jinja in
the east region and Mukono in central Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Similar operation will continue in other eastern areas,
Luswata added.

KHARTOUM, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese Foreign Minister Ali

</P>
<P>
He was quoted by Ra'e El-Aakher newspaper today as saying

</P>
<P>
The Sudanese minister added that he would make public the

<HEADLINE> Some OPEC Members Predict Oil Production Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Some members of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) have
predicted that there will be an increase in the OPEC's production
ceiling.
</P>
<P>
The ceiling will rise from the current 25.033 million barrels
per day (bpd) to 27 million bpd, Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Namdar
Zangeneh said upon his arrival at Soekarno-Hatta International
Airport here today.
</P>
<P>
He said the production quota issue will be taken up during the
103rd ministerial meeting of the OPEC to be held here from
November 26 to December 1 with the participation of 11 member
countries.
</P>
<P>
He also predicted that the world's oil demand will grow by
about 2 million bpd next year from the current 73.7 million bpd to
75 million bpd.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Saudi Petroleum Minister Ali al-Naimi said upon his
arrival here that oil prices "can be better."
</P>
<P>
But, he refused to comment on whether the OPEC should raise its
production quota.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil producer, accounts for 32
percent of OPEC output. It said several weeks ago that it favored
an increase of 2 million barrels a day to around 27 million
barrels.
</P>
<P>
But that was before talks of a possible rise in Iraqi output
under its oil-for-food arrangement with the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait's Oil Minister Isa al-Mazeedi on Monday renewed his
country's call for a higher individual OPEC quota if the group
agrees to raise its current overall production ceiling of 25.03
million bpd.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that despite expected higher world oil demand next
year, an increase in the OPEC quota plus a rise in Iraqi output
would be too much for the market and could push prices down.
</P>
<P>
However, Libyan Energy Minister Abdullah Salem el-Baderi said
here today that his country wants the OPEC to maintain its
production quota at the current level.
</P>
<P>
OPEC oil ministers will officially begin their semi-annual
meeting here Wednesday to decide whether to raise the quota for
the first time since September 1993 and how to accommodate resumed
Iraqi oil production.
</P>
<P>
The OPEC groups Algeria, Ecuador, Gabon, Indonesia, Iran,
Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab
Emirates, Venezuela and Iraq.

KIEV, November (Xinhua) -- The European Union will increase

although funds for other East European countries will be reduced,
a newspaper report here said today.

of a bailout by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), South
Korean stock prices tumbled today to a 10-year low for the second
consecutive day.
</P>
<P>
The leading composite index at the Seoul bourse plunged 11.05
points to 439.59, the lowest level since July 9, 1987, when the
index stood at 441.02.
</P>
<P>
During the day, the index once declined to 423.71 points, but
resurged on the back of the government's announcement that it
would review the possibility of introducing long-term bonds which
will not necessitate a background check on the source of the funds.
</P>
<P>
Market analysts said panic about an inevitable restructuring in
the business sector prompted bond yields to rise sharply. The
yield for three-year maturity bonds shot up 1.55 percentage points
to 17.6 percent, the highest level in five-and-a-half years.
</P>
<P>
Even though interest rates have greatly increased, the bonds,
including those issued by affiliates belonging to the top three
business groups, did not attract any buyers.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the South Korean won remained weak against the U.S.
dollar, mainly because of strong demand for the greenback among
foreign currency-thirsty merchant banks, dealers said.
</P>
<P>
The won, which lost the strength it regained over the few days
until Monday, closed at a further-sagging 1,122 against the
dollar, putting the base rate to be posted at 1,117.50 won on
Wednesday, up 17 won over Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Market experts predicted that the stock market would undergo a
further decline to the level of 400 points and the won would
remain at the 1,100 level for the time being.
</P>
<P>
A growing number of bankruptcies in troubled companies and
financial institutions would occur since the IMF is expected to
demand more painful steps to stablize the financial markets as
well as restructuring the debts-laden industries, they said.
</P>
<P>
South Korean and the IMF officials started their two or three
weeks' negotiations on the conditions for the IMF rescue loan on
Monday. The first batch of bailouts will come in mid-December.
</P>
<P>
In response to foreign press reports that the 20-billion-dollar
loan applied by Seoul will not be sufficient to resolve the
current financial crisis, a senior government official said Monday
that his government is considering a package of 50 billion
U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Vice Premier Discusses Role of Education in Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Vice Premier Li Lanqing
stressed the importance of education and opening up China's
central and western areas to economic development.
</P>
<P>
Li, also a Standing Committee member of the Political Bureau of
the Communist Party of China's (CPC) Central Committee, made these
remarks during a four-day tour this month in central China's Hubei
Province.
</P>
<P>
In his visit to institutions of higher education, primary and
middle schools in Wuhan, capital of Hubei from 21 to 24 of this
month, Li told teachers that China's modernization largely depends
on quality of citizens and skilled personnel, and that the country's
educational reforms should be deepened.
</P>
<P>
He urged all schools of fundamental education to abandon the
traditional mode of exam-oriented education and turn to quality
education to help students grow up comprehensively and healthily.
</P>
<P>
"The educational quality of a school should be judged by what
kind of people it fosters for the society, instead of merely by
its students' performance in the entrance examinations for
instutions of higher learning," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also urged local governments to ensure the quality of
textbooks and to take effective measures to improve both the
general quality and living conditions of the teachers, especially
those in primary and secondary schools.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with participants of a symposium on investment
and development of central Chinese areas, Li pointed out that the
15th CPC National Congress reiterated that opening up to the
outside world is one of China's long-term basic policies.
</P>
<P>
"With rich resources, a vast market and growing state support,
the central and western regions are gaining more advantages in
development and opening up," he added.
</P>
<P>
He urged the central and western areas to make greater
efforts at reforms and combine the opening-up drive with a
strategic reshuffle of the state-owned economy.

<HEADLINE> Orchestra Touring China to Play German, Austrian Music </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Rhine River musicians will
offer Chinese audiences the best of German and Austrian music
during their Chinese tour Nov. 26-30.
</P>
<P>
According to the China Performing Arts Agency (CPAA), the
Saarbrucken Radio Symphony Orchestra will give several concerts in
Tianjin, Shanghai and Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Chief conductor Michael Stern has directed such well-known
symphonies as the Orchestra National de Lyon in France and the
Tonhalle Orchestra Zurich.
</P>
<P>
"Stern is a firm believer in the responsibility of performers
to present the music of their time, and he is also active in
introducing new and little-known works," said a spokesman for
sponsoring CPAA.
</P>
<P>
The CPAA calls the upcoming performance a good combination of
East and West, because its soloist are two Chinese musicians
living abroad -- Wang Jian on cello and Han Xiaoming on horn.
</P>
<P>
Wang Jian studied cello with his father when he was four years
old. "During his years at the Shanghai Conservatory of Music he
was heard by renowned cellist Aldo Parisot, who was so impressed
that he arranged for the young artist to enter the Yale School of
Music in 1985," the spokesman said. At the age of 11, he won
international acclaim.
</P>
<P>
The upcoming five-day series of concerts will give Chinese
music lovers an opportunity to appreciate the works of such
classical composers as Richard Wagner, Joseph Haydn and Johannes
Brahms.

<P>
JAKARTA, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Trade between Indonesia and
China continues to increase and is expected to reach about 4
billion U.S. dollars by the end of this year, a noted businessman
said.
</P>
<P>
The Singapore-based Indonesian shipping magnate, Tong Djoe,
said here today that trade and investment between the two nations
will greatly increase if Indonesia could strengthen its
cooperation with China's small and medium-sized enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Trade and investment cooperation between the two countries has
been carried out by big businesses while China's potentials are in
its small and medium-sized businesses, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Trade value between Indonesia and China in 1995 was recorded at
3.49 billion dollars and it increased to 3.71 billion dollars in
1996.
</P>
<P>
"Both countries' trading value this year is expected to
increase as in the first semester of 1997 alone the figure already
reached almost 3 billion U.S. dollars," said Tong Djoe, who plays
an important role in promoting trade between Indonesia and China.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian commodities in demand in China are plywood, pulp,
crude palm oil, natural rubber and coffee.

<HEADLINE> European Commission Calls for Rights for EU Citizens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission today
kicked off the second phase of the Citizens First initiative, a
campaign to create awareness among the EU citizens about their
rights.
</P>
<P>
Under the initiative, the EU's executive body called for
citizen rights concerning equal opportunities between men and
women, consumer protection, buying goods and services in other
member states and traveling within the EU.
</P>
<P>
"Citizens First is a practical and effective means of raising
people's awareness about their rights in the EU," said Mario
Monti, EU commissioner responsible for single market affairs.
</P>
<P>
He added that the program was aimed at informing EU citizens of
their rights and how they can use them in practice in order to
make a success of the planned single market.
</P>
<P>
The second phase, which builds on the formula of the first
phase of Citizens First, is aimed to provide EU citizens with
clear and factual information on the rights and opportunities
people have as a result of the EU and on what to do if these
rights are denied.
</P>
<P>
Since the launching of the first phase in November 1996, some
75 million people across the EU have become aware of the program,
according to the Commission.
</P>
<P>
It says that more than one million people have contacted
Citizens First via the free phone numbers and the Internet site to
obtain guides and fact sheets concerning their rights to work,
live and study in another EU country.
</P>
<P>
However, EU surveys have revealed that though people are
interested in the areas covered by the second phase of the
initiative, they are still not always aware of their basic rights.
</P>
<P>
Some young people expect that it will become easier to travel
around the EU in ten years' time and yet do not realize how easy
it is already, says the survey, adding that almost half of young
people in the EU have not made a visit to another member state in
the last two years.

TEHRAN, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Iran today ruled out any impact
of its recent political developments on the forthcoming summit of
the Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC) due to be held here
next month.
</P>
<P>
"Iran is the most stable country in the region and we do not
believe the recent political developments in Iran would have any
impact on the OIC summit," Sadeq Kharrazi, head of the preparation
body for the summit, said at a press conference today.
</P>
<P>
Last week, rallies and demonstrations were held across Iran
condemning Ayatollah Hussein Ali Montazeri, a famous religious
canonist, who accused Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei
of interfering in the affairs of the government.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi said that other countries also had such political
issues, but the Iranian government had not shown any concern.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said that Iran was fully prepared for the summit,
adding that of the 55 OIC members, 27 heads of state had announced
to attend the summit.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that the seat of Afghanistan at the summit would
be vacant due to the chaotic situation in the war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
He said that the issues of Jerusalem, Palestine, Kashmir,
Bosnia-Herzegovina, Afghanistan would be the main subjects of the
summit.

<HEADLINE> Remains of American Air Crew Turned Over to U.S. </HEADLINE>

<P>
GUILIN, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Part of the remains of an
American military air crew who died in a crash in Guangxi during
World War II were turned over today to a field survey team from
the United States.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time the Chinese side has turned over
remains of the air crew to the United States. The first was on
January 15, this year.
</P>
<P>
More than half a century ago, during World War II, a U.S. Army
Air Corps B-24 bomber crashed in the Maoershan Mountains in
Xingan County in southern China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has assisted a team of experts in the
second search for crew members' remains.
</P>
<P>
A plank road along the face of a cliff was jointly built by the
Chinese and Americans to carry out the search work. Because of the
size of the area to be searched and bad weather, the U.S. team was
unable to thoroughly complete the search work. They plan to return
next year for a third search.
</P>
<P>
At today's transfer ceremony, the leader of the U.S. team -- on
behalf of his government, relatives of the dead crew, and the
whole American people -- offered hanks to the Chinese government
at all levels and Guangxi residents for their humanitarian
support.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists plan to
carry out a cloning project in the near future to increase the
number of Yunnan snub-nosed monkeys, according to today's
"People's Daily."
</P>
<P>
Scientists with the Kunming Zoological Research Institute are
using advanced technology to research hereditary features of the
primate in preparation for the cloning, the report said, but gave
no details.
</P>
<P>
"This is the third kind of protective ways for the rare
species, other than creating nature reserves and keeping them in
captivity," the report said, adding that the protection of this
rare primate could have a bright future.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan snub-nosed monkeys, also known as golden monkeys, are on
the brink of extinction.
</P>
<P>
Researchers at the institute, under the Chinese Academy of
Sciences, have bred 13 such monkeys in captivity since 1994 with
the aid of reproductive research, the report said.
</P>
<P>
They have conducted an overall investigation of the monkeys'
living conditions in the wild since they were discovered in
southwestern China's Yunnan Province a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
Nature reserves of the Yunnan snub-nosed monkeys have been
established in the northwestern part of the province.
</P>
<P>
"However, we are still facing problems, such as damage to the
monkey's habitats caused by excessive lumbering and a shortage of
research funds," said Ji Weizhi, director of the institute.

PARIS, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The National Secretary of the

possibility of a merger between his party and the Socialist Party,
because, he said, it would weaken the leftist force in France.
</P>
<P>
"The reversal of the Congress of Tours is out of the question,"

Congress of Tours held by the French Socialists, which resulted in

But he expressed his support to "all which can contribute to
improving the conditions of the union" with the Socialists through
a "unitary pact for progress."

He said the PCF and the Socialist Party could present common
candidates in the regional elections scheduled for March 1998.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Henri Weber, a French senator from the Socialist
Party, said that "ideologically, it is from now possible" to
reverse the Congress of Tours. He was writing in the PCF daily,

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Police Ordered to Probe Election Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The Kenya Electoral
Commission (EC) has directed the police commissioner to launch
immediate investigation into the reported incidents of election
campaign violence in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Nation today quoted the EC Chairman Zacchaeus
Chesoni as saying on Monday that the commission had moved to stem
violence during the campaign period when some presidential
opposition candidates were reported to have been subjected to
pre-poll violence.
</P>
<P>
The motorcade of the Democratic Party Presidential candidate
Mwai Kibaki was reportedly stoned in Kiambu town, about 20
kilometers north of Nairobi, minutes after he addressed a
campaign rally in the town on November 15.
</P>
<P>
Raila Odinga, who is vying on an opposition National
Development Party ticket, escaped with minor injuries when youths
stoned his motorcade last Saturday in Kisii District, southwest
Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The EC Chairman noted that the electoral code agreed on during
the Inter-Party Parliamentary Group talks empowers the commission
to bar a candidate or party from campaigning if found guilty of
encouraging violence.
</P>
<P>
He warned that it was an infringement of the code to publish
and repeat false, defamatory or inflammatory allegations
concerning any candidate or party.
</P>
<P>
The local newspaper East African Standard today reported that
at least two people were killed and scores injured as election
campaign violence escalated in various parts of Kenya.
</P>
<P>
A campaign manager to Lugari parliamentary aspirant Cyrus
Jirongo of the ruling Kenya African National Union was shot dead
by thugs during a door-to-door campaign.
</P>
<P>
The second victim was a youth who was stabbed to death as
rowdy mobs clashed over campaign cash handouts in Machakos
District, about 80 kilometers south of Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
Chesoni appealed to candidates to assist the commission to
enforce the electoral code by restraining supporters from acts of
violence, threats of violence or incitement.

<HEADLINE> UN Arms Inspectors Continue Mission in Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Six inspection teams of the
United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) overseeing the
dismantling of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction continue their
mission today, the Iraqi News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The teams set out between 8:30 and 9:30 local time (0530 and
0630 GMT) to inspect a number of suspected sites for making
weapons, according to the agency.
</P>
<P>
This was the fourth consecutive day that U.N. arms experts
undertake their work after Iraq allowed them back on Friday ending
a three-week standoff.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been cooperating with the UNSCOM, hoping that it will
finish its inspection mission as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The commission will certify if Iraq has complied with the
orders issued in 1991 to destroy all its nuclear, chemical and
biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
Only then will the U.N. Security Council lift the economic
sanctions, including a ban on oil export, imposed on Iraq
following its invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
But U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen Sunday accused Iraq of
barring U.N. inspectors from entering 63 sites, warning of the
possibility of rekindling a crisis.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Baghdad asserted that Iraq and UNSCOM have reached
an agreement that arms inspectors should not do anything that may
jeopardize Iraq's sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the inspectors should not enter the
"sensitive" sites like presidential palaces that represent Iraq's
sovereignty, it said.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Economic Growth Rate to Fall: Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The growth rate of Kenya's
economy is expected to be 3.6 percent this year, down from the
4.2 percent in last year, a central bank official said.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Nation newspaper today quoted Thomas Kibua, deputy
governor of the Central Bank of Kenya, as saying that the
expected drop in tourism earnings, lack of investor confidence
and the uncertainty associated with elections would lead to a
growth rate of about 3.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
He told an annual dinner of the Kenya Institute of Bankers
that the performance of the economy and the banking industry was
expected to improve next year due to improved earnings from
tourism and less investors' anxiety after the elections.
</P>
<P>
The bank official pointed out that the major challenges for
Kenya's economy would be maintaining low inflation and a stable
Shilling exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the World Economic Outlook for October published by
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) predicted that Kenya's
economy would increase by 3.5 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
The IMF publication attributed the lower growth rate to the
drought and El Nino rains suffered in most parts of the country,
the violence linked to the demands for constitutional reforms and
skirmishes at the coastal region adversely affecting the
country's tourism.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Chinese Senior Military Leader Meets French General Chief of Staff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 25 (Xinhua) -- General Chi Haotian,
vice-chairman of China's Central Military Commission, said today
that China values its ties with European Union countries and holds
that a prosperous and strong Europe will be conducive to the
world peace and stability in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Chi, also Chinese state councillor and national defense
minister, made the remarks in a meeting here this afternoon with
Jean-Philippe Douin, general chief of Staff of the Armed Forces of
France.
</P>
<P>
China and France enjoy a good relationship and ties between the
two armed forces have scored constant and steady growth since
the two countries forged diplomatic relations, Chi said.
</P>
<P>
China is the biggest developing country, while France is a
developed one, and both are permanent members of the UN Security
Council, he said, adding that the establishment of a comprehensive
strategic partnership for the future between the two nations will
not only serve the fundamental interests of the two peoples, but
also benefit the peace and development of the world as a whole.
</P>
<P>
He said that the present China visit by Douin would advance the
existing friendly and cooperative ties between the two countries
and the two armed forces.
</P>
<P>
Douin said that the relations between the two armed forces are
growing steadily. Every French government attaches great
importance to French-China ties, he told Chi.
</P>
<P>
France and China share similar or identical views on many
international issues and the two countries are conducting good
cooperation in various United Nations organizations, Douin said.
</P>
<P>
Douin noted that the current China tour has given him a better
understanding of China. China is a peace-loving country and is
pursuing a defensive policy of defense, thus it will not
constitute a threat to other countries, Douin said.
</P>
<P>
On another occasion today, Chinese Vice-Foreign Minister
Wang Yingfan also met with Douin and his party.

BEIJING, November 25 (Xinhua) -- A senior official of the
Chinese Communist Party (CPC) said here today that China is ready
to make joint effort with Mongolia to develop healthy and stable
ties of friendship and bring such relations into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>

Committee, said China and Mongolia are close neighbors and there
exists profound traditional friendship between the two peoples.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, he said, the exchanges and cooperation between
the two countries in political, economic, cultural and other areas
have been expanding.
</P>
<P>
Hu noted that the CPC attaches importance to the relations with
major political parties, particularly ruling parties, in China's
neighboring countries.

equality, mutual respect and mutual non-interference into each
other's internal affairs.

<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations is calling
for 406 million U.S. dollars in 1998 for its humanitarian programs
in Bosnia, Croatia, Yugoslavia and Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
In the two years after the signing of the Dayton accord,
noticeable progress has been achieved by the international
community to help the region overcome the war destruction build
lasting peace, said the UN Department of Humanitarian Affairs in a
press release Monday.
</P>
<P>
However, it pointed out, much still remains to be done. Up to
1.6 million displaced persons and refugees remain uprooted;
several million landmines continue to threaten lives and impede
rehabilitation and return of people; and much of the
infrastructure in the war-impacted areas, ranging from individual
homes through key services, are yet to be rehabilitated.
</P>
<P>
The programs contained in the Consolidated Inter-Agency Appeal
for 1998 will have a major role to play in meeting such needs.
</P>
<P>
The appeal covers the proposed activities of various UN
agencies including the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, the UN
Development Program, World Food Program, the UN Children's Fund
and the World Health Organization.

BERLIN, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Two former East German sports
doctors have been charged with physically harming female swimmers
by giving them banned substances, Berlin prosecutors said on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The two were named as 55-year-old Bernd Pansold and 58-year-old

<HEADLINE> China Eyes Nuclear Wasteland for Oil (1) By Zhang Xianguo and Li Xiguang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lop Nur (Xinjiang), November 25 (Xinhua) -- China is looking
for oil in the nuclear wasteland in northwestern China's Xinjiang
Uygur Autonomous Region soon after the Chinese government agreed
to a moratorium on nuclear testing last year.
</P>
<P>
On the lifeless land of the western Lop Nur, a granite stele
engraved with the inscription "The Center of China's First Nuclear
Test Explosion" stood lonely in the wilderness, with only a few
footprints of wild camels around it.
</P>
<P>
About eight kilometers south of the stele is a group of
white-colored temporary buildings which house over 100 geologists
and workmen looking for oil.
</P>
<P>
At Lop Nur, a desolate area often dubbed as the "zone of
death", China conducted 23 atmospheric nuclear tests from 1964 to
1981.
</P>
<P>
China formally became a party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation
Treaty in March of 1992, and in July last year the Chinese
government announced a moratorium on nuclear testing.
</P>
<P>
Sixteen years after China stopped nuclear explosion at the
site, the region's radioactive level has dropped to a much lower
and normal standard and poses no threat to environment, according
to researchers working there.
</P>
<P>
"Our gamma radiation measurements have shown that the radiation
here is pretty low," said Huo Wenhong, director of the prospecting team
sent by the China Petroleum and Natural Gas Corporation, "There is
no nuclear contamination of water and soil here."
</P>
<P>
"My colleagues and I are not worried about any health effects
due to environmental exposures," he added.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon's National Carrier Under Investigation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon's national carrier, the
Middle East Airlines (MEA), is under investigation over a leasing
deal of three planes with Singapore Airlines, the Beirut Times
newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon's judicial department has requested the MEA to submit
its monthly financial report for the investigation, according to
the paper.
</P>
<P>
The MEA reportedly paid a large commission to Marwan Fouad
Bardawil, son of Lebanese prominent businessman Fouad Bardawil, to
negotiate the deal with Singapore Airlines.
</P>
<P>
This has violated the ban of the national carrier on using
intermediaries in such deals or paying commissions.
</P>
<P>
Marwan Fouad Bardawil has been arrested for allegedly accepting
the money, according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
But Khaled Salam, chairman of the MEA said the airlines is not
involved in any unethical deal.
</P>
<P>
"We usually negotiate the leasing of planes with any foreign
firm directly, without the need to go through a third party to
finalize the deal," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the leasing deal of the three planes has been
approved by MEA's board of directors several months ago.
</P>
<P>
The MEA will pay 39 million U.S. dollars to Singapore Airlines
to lease the three planes for five years, according to Salam.
</P>
<P>
He revealed that the MEA has filed a law suit months ago
against Bardawil and Singapore Airlines, which he accused of
breaching their contract by paying commissions to the arrestee to
help win the deal.

<HEADLINE> HK People More Confident About Anti-Corruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 25 (Xinhua) -- An annual survey conducted
by the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) today
revealed a significant increase in public confidence in the body.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, 85.7 percent of respondents said their
confidence in the ICAC will increase or remain the same in the
coming year.
</P>
<P>
"This year's survey results showed that the public have become
more optimistic about the control of corruption and that public
confidence in the ICAC has increased significantly," said Prof.
Wong Siu-lun, Convenor of the Community Research Sub-Committee of
the ICAC's Citizens Advisory Committee on Community Relations.
</P>
<P>
The smooth transition and the ICAC's effective work in the past
year boosted the confidence, he said.
</P>
<P>
A total of 76.5 percent of respondents considered the ICAC's
anti-corruption work effective or very effective, which
represented an increase of 7.4 percentage points when compared
with last year.
</P>
<P>
Seventy percent of those surveyed considered the ICAC impartial
in its investigation work, which represented an improvement of
10.5 percentage points over last year.
</P>
<P>
As regards the finding that 55.2 percent of those polled said
the ICAC had not done enough to make its own work known to the
public, ICAC's Director of Community Relations Miss Janet Wong
Wing-chen said the ICAC will continue to enhance its transparency
through the media and direct contact.
</P>
<P>
A 13 episode-spot series on the ICAC's work will be telecast on
a local channel starting from tomorrow, followed by the English
version in March next year. A new drama series to be produced by
the ICAC itself will be released in the coming summer, she said.
</P>
<P>
She said the ICAC will step up preventive education in the
business sector and strengthen moral education for students as
well as young people at work.
</P>
<P>
In the first 10 months of this year, 2,471 reports alleging
corruption were received by the ICAC, down 4 percent from the same
period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The ICAC has conducted annual surveys to gauge the public's
views on issues such as the corruption scene in Hong Kong and
ICAC's performance. This year's survey was carried out by MDR
Technology Ltd. between July 14 and 18, with a total of 1,104
respondents interviewed through telephone.

<HEADLINE> Murder Cases Decrease in KwaZulu Natal Province, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The murder rate in South
Africa's KwaZulu Natal Province is down by 10.5 percent from
January to September this year compared to the same period in
1996, Premier Ben Ngubane said.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a two-day provincial crime prevention summit in
Durban Monday, Ngubane said attempted murder had decreased by 9.8
percent and armed robbery had also shown a significant drop.
</P>
<P>
However, rape had increased by 2.4 percent and stock theft by
6.4 percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
The premier commended provincial police for their active role
in combating crime in the province. He also attributed much of
their success to the public and their commitment and loyalty in
assisting police in investigations.
</P>
<P>
Ngubane stressed the fight against crime could not be left to
law enforcement agencies, saying, "the communities must be an
equally active partner."
</P>
<P>
KwaZulu Natal Province is believed to be one of provinces
where crimes and violence activities are high on alert.
</P>
<P>
The summit was part of a national crime preventiont strategy
organized by the Safety and Security Ministry to implement crime
prevention programs.
</P>
<P>
The meeting would discuss, among others, urban crime
prevention, youth as victims and perpetrators of crime, violence
against women and violence in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Similar summits had already been held in other eight
provinces.

<HEADLINE> Political Stalemate Continues in India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The political stalemate
arising from a report on the assassination of former Prime
Minister Rajiv Gandhi continued today as the Congress party is yet
to respond to a letter of reconciliation from Prime Minister Inder
Kumar Gujral.
</P>
<P>
The interim report, based on investigation into the 1991
assassination, accused the Dravida Munnetra Kazagham (DMK), a
major constituent of the ruling United Front, of involvement in
the incident.
</P>
<P>
Since the report was tabled in the parliament on November 20,
the Congress party has been demanding the ouster of the three DMK
ministers from the Gujral government, warning that it would
withdraw support for the government if its demand is not met.
</P>
<P>
The United Front government depends on the support of the
Congress party for sustaining a majority in the lower house of the
parliament.
</P>
<P>
In a letter delivered to Congress party President Sitaram Kesri
on Monday night, Gujral rejected the demand but offered to talk
with the party to seek a way out of the current political crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Congress Working Committee, the supreme decision-making
body of the Congress party, met here briefly on Monday night after
the letter was delivered to Kesri but deferred a response to the
letter.
</P>
<P>
The committee is likely to meet again later today to consider
Gujral's letter, the Press Trust of India reported.
</P>
<P>
United Front sources said a meeting of the core committee of
the 13-party front is likely to be held in the evening after the
Congress party responds to the prime minister's letter.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Trade Surplus Grows Sharply in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 25 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's trade
surplus rose sharply to 1.73 billion Rand (360 million U.S.
Dollars) in October from 144 million Rand (nearly 30 million
Dollars) in September, reflecting a 30 percent surge in exports.
</P>
<P>
The trade surplus far exceeded the consensus forecast of 620
million Rand (130 million Dollars), the Business Day newspaper
said today.
</P>
<P>
The trade surplus from January to October is 11.45 billion
Rand (2.4 billion Dollars), an increase of 37 percent from a year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
Customs and excise figures released Monday showed that exports
were 14.73 billion Rand in October, up from 11.35 billion in
September.
</P>
<P>
Manufactured exports have performed particularly well, making
up for gold's lackluster performance. Machinery and transport
equipment exports remained the star performers, with growth of
about 45 percent in the first 10 months of the year.
</P>
<P>
Although imports rose to almost 13 billion Rand in October
from 11.21 billion in September, economists said the growth was
less worrying as the bill had been boosted by oil purchases.
</P>
<P>
When oil was excluded, imports in October were up only 7
percent month on month and 5.5 percent year on year.

<HEADLINE> Asia to Build Sustainable Cities into 21st Century </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of delegates from
the Asia-Pacific region gathered here today at an environment
conference to discuss how the fast-growing Asian cities can
maintain sustained development into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
The Pollution in the Metropolitan and Urban Environment
(POLMET) conference, held every three years since 1985, centered
its theme this year on "Sustainability in the 21st century -- The
Challenge for Asian Cities."
</P>
<P>
Asia has achieved rapid economic growth over the past decade,
but at the same time the region has to face increasingly severe
environmental problems for lack of properly integrated policies,
financial resources and technical know-how, according to the
organizer, the Hong Kong Institution of Engineers.
</P>
<P>
The three-day meeting provides a forum for policy makers,
professionals and business executives from some 30 countries and
regions to address inter-relationships between society, economy
and environment.
</P>
<P>
Xie Zhenhua, head of China's National Environmental Protection
Agency, kicked off the keynote session today by delivering a
speech titled "Building sustainable cities". He said: "It is
possible to strike a balance between fast economic growth and a
clean living environment so as to attain the goal of
sustainability."
</P>
<P>
Six Chinese cities -- Dalian, Shenzhen, Weihai, Xiamen, Zhuhai
and Zhangjiagang -- that are attending the POLMET '97 have done
equally well in both economic expansion and environment
protection, said Xie.
</P>
<P>
Xie outlined the aims in tackling water, air, solid waste, and
noise pollution in all 666 Chinese cities in the near future. By
the year of 2010, he said, sewage disposal plants would be built
in middle-sized cities, the air quality index would be reported on
a weekly or even daily basis, and non-lethal petrol would be used
in all automobiles.

SINGAPORE, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Share prices declined
sharply on the Singapore market as the benchmark Straits Times
Industrials Index lost 35.45 points to close at 1,646.4 points
today.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said the sharp fall was triggered by steep losses in
Japan after the collapse of the Yamaichi Securities Co., the
fourth largest securities house of Japan.
</P>

However, they noted that talks of forced selling of Malaysian
shares also dampened sentiment for Singapore stocks.

The total market volume increased to 203.69 million units,
valued at 342.04 million Singapore dollars (about 213.78 million
US dollars). Declines overwhelmed advances by 290 to 61, while 267
other counters remained unchanged.
</P>
<P>
The Singapore Telecom was the most actively traded counter as
it registered a turnover of 19.36 million units. It was followed
by MBf Capital which had 18.37 million shares. Local computer
maker IPC Corporation had 10.76 million of its shares changed
hands.
</P>
<P>
Renong Bhd led the gainers of the day as it rose by 43 cents to
finish at 1.22 Singapore dollars. The Singapore Land increased by
20 cents to end at 4.6 Singapore dollars, while the Overseas Union
Bank (OUB) Foreign gained 15 cents to close at 5.85 Singapore
dollars.
</P>
<P>
On the downside, Del Gro 500 was the biggest loser as it
declined by 4.1 dollars to end at three Singapore dollars.
Creative 50 fell by 2.3 dollars to close at 43.7 Singapore
dollars. Uniphoenix lost 1.6 dollars to finish at 2.42 Singapore
dollars, while the Singapore Press Holdings (SPH) Foreign was 1.3
dollars lower at 21.1 Singapore dollars.

LONDON, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Colin McRae of Britain took a
comfortable lead in British RAC auto rally after the third stage
of the final day in Cheltenham, England, on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He was poised to win the race as his closest rival, fellow

McRae would win this year's world title if he takes the RAC
race and title rival Tommi Makinen of Finland finishes out of the
top six. Makinen was now in the sixth place.
</P>

Burns, level overnight with McRae, set the fastest time on the
opening stage of the day in his Mitsubishi and maintained a
14-second lead heading into the 21st stage.
</P>
<P>
But Burns was forced to change one of the tires after a
puncture, which dropped him to fourth overall four minutes and 45
seconds off the lead.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon's Two Leading Banks to Merge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Byblos Bank, one of
the country's largest banks, has agreed to a merger with Banque
Beyrouth pour le Commerce (BBC), a medium-sized bank, in a deal
rumored to be worth around 120 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
According to a press report said today, the move is the latest
in a series of central bank-sponsored consolidation in the
country's banking sector that has seen two other small banks
selling up to larger institutions.
</P>
<P>
The deal will result in a combined operation with a capital of
250 million U.S. dollars, and a market share of around 8 percent
of total deposits and 7.5 percent of loans, the Beirut Times
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
An analyst told the paper that BBC did not wish to be left
behind by the big banks. "They did the smart thing by joining big
boys," he added.
</P>
<P>
Maurice Iskandar, director of Beirut-based rating agency Fins,
said smaller banks that incorporate into larger ones benefit from
services and technologies they find too expensive to develop on
their own.
</P>
<P>
The new bank, which retains the name Byblos, will become the
third largest bank in the country ahead of Banque Audi and behind
Banque du Liban et d'Outre-mer and Banque de la Mediterranee.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the need for size to spread the cost of investment
in technology and training, one of the main advantages of the deal
is BBC's 19-strong branch network, which according to analysts,
fits in well with Byblos's 33 outlets.
</P>
<P>
Sources familiar with the deal also say that Byblos is keen to
retain BBC personnel who will be represented on the combined
banks' board after the merger goes through.
</P>
<P>
Byblos's profits are expected to top 30 million U.S. dollars
this year and its market capitalization is estimated in excess of
600 million U.S. dollars.

TOKYO, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The collapse of Yamaichi
Securities Co. jolted the Tokyo stock market today, with the key
Nikkei index marking the second largest single-day loss for the
year.
</P>

<HEADLINE> KDP Rejects Talks with PUK in Baghdad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, November 25 (Xinhua) -- A major Kurdish group has
refused to hold peace talks in Iraqi capital Baghdad with its
rival in northern Iraq, Turkey's Daily News reported today.
</P>
<P>
An official of the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP), who asked
not to be named, told the paper that his party made the decision
to protest the occupation of its positions by the pro-Iranian
Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK).
</P>
<P>
However, the official expressed KDP's willingness to continue
the talks in Turkish capital Ankara. The KDP is reported to have
the backing of both Ankara and Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
The two contenders have been fighting for the control of
northern Iraq since the 1991 Gulf War when the Iraqi government
was rendered ineffective by the allied forces to exert influence
there.
</P>
<P>
The Baghdad government has been trying to mediate a peace deal
between the two sides, which held their first round of talks last
October in Baghdad under the auspices of Iraqi Deputy Prime
Minister Tariq Aziz, but made little progress.
</P>
<P>
A second round of talks was suspended because of the fierce
attacks launched by the KDP two weeks ago, in which it recaptured
most of the territories lost to the PUK.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Turkey, the United States and Britain have been
making efforts to realize reconciliation between the two parties,
and restore peace and stability in northern Iraq within a formula
of "Ankara Peace Process."
</P>
<P>
A KDP delegation led by its senior official Sami Abdurrahman
who is in charge of the peace talks with the PUK is in Ankara for
discussion with Turkish officials.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Gov't to Postpone Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government has
decided to postpone investment implementation by two years due to
the monetary crisis, official sources from the Investment
Coordinating Board said here today.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made on Monday by State Minister of Investment
Sanyoto Sastrowardoyo, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
According to the state minister, the current monetary turmoil
does not affect investment approval but it delays implementation
of investment in the country.
</P>
<P>
According to investment regulations, investment application has
to be implemented in three years after being approved at the
latest.
</P>
<P>
Sastrowardoyo said the postponement aims at helping businessmen
who are facing liquidity problems and other difficulties due to
the monetary crisis.
</P>
<P>
Up till November 8, he said, approved domestic investment
amounted to 110 trillion rupiah (32.3 billion US dollars),
compared with 100.7 trillion (29.61 billions US dollars) of last
year. While the approved foreign investment totaled 29.6 billion
US dollars, compared with 29.9 billion dollars of last year.
</P>
<P>
The state minister said the implementation rate for domestic
investment was only 47.96 percent and the implementation rate for
foreign investment was 53.44 percent in the country.
</P>
<P>
The decline of investment implementation, he said, is due to
lack of liquidity while 90 percent of the approved investment is
financed with credit.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Summons Ambassador Amid Tensions With Qatar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Egypt has summoned its
ambassador to Qatar, Mohamed Meneissi, for consultations on the
growing strained relations with the small Gulf emirate, the Middle
East News Agency (MENA) reported today.
</P>
<P>
It was the second time in less than three weeks that the
ambassador was called back home. Angered by Qatar's insistence on
hosting the controversial fourth Middle East and North Africa
economic conference this month, Egypt recalled Meneissi on
November 7.
</P>
<P>
Egypt also has asked for an explanation from the Qatari
government regarding the statements its Foregin Minister Sheikh
Hamad ben Jassim ben Jabir al-Thani has recently made.
</P>
<P>
The Qatari official on November 12 linked Egypt to an attempted
coup against the Gulf Arab state's emir, Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa
al-Thani, who toppled his father in a bloodless palace coup in
1995.
</P>
<P>
Cairo has denied Qatari allegations of involvement in the
failed coup in Qatar last year.
</P>
<P>
Egypt asked to know whether these statements express the
personal views of the Qatari official or mirror the official
conviction, said MENA.
</P>
<P>
Reports here said Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa met with
Qatari Ambassador to Egypt, Maniya al-Hagry, on Monday to lodge
the requests.
</P>
<P>
Moussa was reported to have told his ambassador to Doha early
this month that relations with Qatar would be kept at the least
possible levels so as not to adversely affect the always tense
inter-Arab relations.
</P>
<P>
The bilateral ties have deteriorated because of Egypt's boycott
of the Doha economic conference that involved Israel at a time
when the Middle East peace process remained deadlocked due to
Israel's hardline policy.
</P>
<P>
Egypt was also furious at a Qatari ban enacted last month
barring the entry of Egyptians and nationals of other nine
countries as a security precaution for the economic
conference.

<HEADLINE> Israel's New Proposal Stirs Mixed Reactions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Reactions to Israel's
proposal on second-stage troop redeployment in the West Bank have
been mixed reactions and so far it seems hard for this proposal to
come into practice.
</P>
<P>
Worked out by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office here
on Monday, the proposal promises to transfer 6 to 8 percent of
West Bank to the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) and the
pullback would take place within five months.
</P>
<P>
But this is contingent on the PNA agreeing to suspend a
third-stage redeployment until the conclusion of final-status
talks.
</P>
<P>
In effect, this means that the third pullback would demarcate
the final boundary line of the Palestinian entity. Upon
completion of the second-stage redeployment, the PNA would control
35 percent to 37 percent of West Bank. At present it has only 29
percent of the land under its rule.
</P>
<P>
Late Monday night, Netanyahu's legal advisor Yitzhak Molcho met
with PNA Chairman Yasser Arafat in Gaza Strip in an attempt to
convince him to agree to Netanyahu's redeployment plan, but
Arafat said "no."
</P>
<P>
The other PNA officials reacted on Monday that they believe
Netanyahu is not serious about pulling back Israeli troops.
</P>
<P>
PNA local Affairs Minister Saeb Erekat said 90 percent of the
West Bank should be transferred to the PNA by the time the parties
approach final-status talks, and the PNA adheres to the original
Oslo timetable.
</P>
<P>
Israel has contended that intervening acts of terrorism delayed
the implementation.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian Legislative Council Speaker Abu Ala echoed Erekat's
statement, saying that he expected Israel to pull back from 90
percent of the land, 30 percent in each stage. Otherwise, he said,
the Palestinians would not agree to begin negotiations on a
permanent peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
Within Israel's coalition government, Netanyahu's proposal
received strong support from his key cabinet ministers like
Foreign Minister David Levy, Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai,
Infrastructure Minister Ariel Sharon, Agriculture Minister Rafael
Eitan and Interior Minister Eli Suissa.
</P>
<P>
They conditioned implementation of the pullbacks on a genuine
PNA crackdown on terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The Third Way also supports this proposal. But some right-wing
lawmakers, including Michael Kleiner representing the Land of
Israel Front in parliament, oppose this proposal, threatening to
topple Netanyahu's government should the second-stage pullback be
carried out.
</P>
<P>
Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh and Netanyahu's Policy Advisor
Uzi Arad will travel to Cairo today to present the proposal to
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in a bid to obtain Egypt's
endorsement, so that Mubarak can persuade the Palestinians to
accept the plan.
</P>
<P>
Under the Hebron Agreement signed January this year, Israel had
to complete its first-stage and second-stage troop redeployments
in West Bank by March 5 and September 7 respectively, and the
third-stage redeployment must be completed by August of 1998.
</P>
<P>
But so far no official redeployment has been executed due to
the Palestinian-Israel quarrel over the size of pullout and
terrorist bombing attacks in Jerusalem.

<HEADLINE> SKorea Eyes Cutbacks in Foreign Exchange Expenditure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, November 25 (Xinhua) -- South Koreans, civic groups and
the governments are now launching campaigns on cutting foreign
exchange spending in a bid to help the country out of the current
financial difficulties.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ministry of Finance and Economy (MOFE), among
this year's approximately 14-billion-U.S. dollar current-account,
the invisible trade shortfall mainly for overseas travel, expected
to reach 8 billion dollars, will be blamed for worsening the
nation's international balance of payment position.
</P>
<P>
Civic groups have called on the public to refrain from making
unnecessary overseas trips and to deposit dollars into banks, as
well as buy South Korean products.
</P>
<P>
Such civic group members can be seen in parks and on streets,
appealing to the people to be thrifty and save hard currency so
that the nation can get out of the financial dilemma.
</P>
<P>
Media reports said many South Koreans have decided to delay
their overseas trips until after the crisis and travel agencies
said more customers asked to cancel their overseas tours while
some of them turned to domestic ones.
</P>
<P>
The government stands poised to come up with a package of
measures aimed at reducing the country's invisible trade deficit.
</P>
<P>
First, the MOFE urged government agencies to cut officials'
business trips as a way to preserve hard currency.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government seeks to put the brakes on lavish
travel expenses. Specifically, monitoring on overseas credit-card
expenses will be strengthened.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, those spending more than 5,000 dollars overseas
with credit cards will be subjet to intensive investigations and
face punishment if their expenses violate foreign exchange
regulations. Possible violations include spending on gambling or
excessive payments for shopping.

<HEADLINE> World Bank: PNA Has Great Economic Potential </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian economy can
grow even under conditions of closure by Israel, The Jerusalem
Post said today, quoting a World Bank report.
</P>
<P>
The report, entitled "Development Under Adversity: The
Palestinian Economy in Transition" and issued Monday, said this
was achieved by taking advantage of its favorable trading status
with the U.S. and European Union,
</P>
<P>
Noting the stifling effects of Israeli blockade of the West
Bank and Gaza Strip, the report finds there are ways that the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) can take economic matters
into its own hands before a diplomatic solution comes about.
</P>
<P>
Among its main recommendations are: increasing the
diversification of trade, especially given the PNA's favorable
trading status with the U.S. and European Union; spending more
government funds on building infrastructure; fostering more
competition within the Palestinian economy.
</P>
<P>
Joseph Stiglitz, the Bank's chief economist, said the
Palestinian economy had enormous potential, citing that students
in Palestinian self-rule areas attend school for an average of
8.1 years, which is close to the Israeli figure.
</P>
<P>
He added that compared to many other economies, the PNA has
considerable capital at its disposal and a rich set of
Palestinian non-governmental organizations around world, which can
push forward the self-rule economy dramatically.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank report also outlines hardships faced by
Palestinians during Israeli occupation, and the uncertainties of
the interim period.
</P>
<P>
"The transitional arrangement has created an awkward mismatch
between responsibility and authority for the PNA," the report
said. "While the PNA can license a business in West Bank or Gaza,
it is Israel that largely controls the movement of goods and
people, including workers and managers."
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the report continues, the self-rule areas are
split into separate economic units. Transport between the north
and south of West Bank is "hampered by the Jerusalem bottleneck."
</P>
<P>
Palestinian and the United Nations estimates put the annual
cost of a prolonged closure imposed by Israel at 1.825 billion to
2.555 billion U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Australian MP Bombarded for Her Political Will Stunt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Bizarre, weird, stupid,
unwise, nutty, irresponsible are some of the terms used today by
Australian leading politicians to comment on Australian MP Pauline
Hanson's move to have her will taped under alleged death threats.
</P>
<P>
Her move, which was disclosed today, drew sharp attacks from
Australian Prime Minister John Howard, Deputy Prime Minister Tim
Fischer, Foreign Minister Alexander Downer and other leading
politicians.
</P>
<P>
Hanson, who is at the center of a race debate in Australia
sparked by her anti-Asian immigration and anti-indigenous people
speech last year, has her last political will and testament
recorded in an address to the nation to be broadcast fully only in
the event that she is assassinated.
</P>
<P>
During her will, Hanson says: "Fellow Australians, if you are
seeing me now, it means I've been murdered," the country's leading
newspaper The Australian reported today.
</P>
<P>
"For the sake of our children and our children's children, you
must fight on ... do not let my passing distract you for one
moment", Hanson was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
But excerpts from her 12-minute will is to be screened tonight
by Channel Seven, a national TV station.
</P>
<P>
Her move was prompted by a flood of death threats she claimed
she had received since founding her One Nation Party in April this
year, Channel Seven said.
</P>
<P>
She denied the address to the nation was a stunt in the wake of
her party's slump to three percent in the polls.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister John Howard, who is now in Vancouver for the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting, expressed surprise over
Hanson's move, the Australian Associated Press (AAP) reported.
</P>
<P>
"It seems very weird to me," the prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister Tim Fischer today told MPs that the
taping of a video will by Pauline Hanson was one of the most
irresponsible actions by any member of parliament that he could
remember.
</P>
<P>
Fischer told a joint meeting of Liberal and National MPs that
Hanson had breached a long-standing convention against bringing
the public's attention to death threats against politicians.
</P>
<P>
The bizarre twist given to the death threats by the recording
of the video will was a desperate attempt to generate publicity by
the Member of Oxley, he said.
</P>
<P>
Asked about Hanson's will, Foreign Minister Alexander Downer
said, "I would say it sounds a bit nutty," AAP reported.
</P>
<P>
Opposition Leader Kim Beazley described Hanson's video message
as totally bizarre.
</P>
<P>
"It is the case that from time to time those of us in politics
face a death threat or face threats to our security. But
generally, politicians considered it wise not to talk about
threats," he said.
</P>
<P>
"This goes a bit beyond that - this is truly bizarre behavior,"
Beazley said.
</P>
<P>
Jeff Kennett, premier of the state of Victoria, said Hanson was
"bizarre" and "stupid" by having her will recorded.
</P>
<P>
"I thought it was bizarre, but then again everything about
Pauline Hanson is absolutely bizarre," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar lost
more than half a U.S. cent today, pressured down by a slide on the
Japanese stock market that flowed through to other regional
bourses.
</P>
<P>
The currency closed in Sydney at 68.71 U.S. cents, from 69.28
late Monday.
</P>
<P>
The local unit had begun the local trading session in line
relatively steady but quickly headed lower in anticipation of the
reaction of the Japanese stock market to news that one of the
country's big four brokerages had collapsed.
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Falls in Asian stock markets
dragged the local exchange lower today but strong buying in the
afternoon ensured it finished well off its lows.
</P>
<P>
The all ordinaries index closed down 27.7 points at 2454.4,
well above its intra-day low of 2432.0.
</P>
<P>
The market was driven lower in the mid-session on fears of a
major collapse on Asian exchanges following Friday's failure of
major Japanese brokerage Yamaichi Securities and was down over two
percent at one stage.

But the lower prices prompted renewed support and a wave of
value buying in the afternoon revived flagging stocks.

The value of shares traded again broke 1 billion Australian
dollars (687.1 million U.S. dollars) with just under 1.25 billion

<HEADLINE> Boeing Increases Employment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles, November 24 (Xinhua) -- With 14,800 workers added
to its Washington state payroll this year through October, Boeing
now employs 234,850 people.
</P>
<P>
The Seattle aerospace manufacturer has 125,822 workers overall
at the beginning of this year, before the acquisition of
St. Louis-based McDonnell Douglas in August. The merger added
63,000 workers to the company.
</P>
<P>
Boeing generally freezes hiring at the end of the year because
of the holidays. But this year, a Boeing spokesman said, people
with needed skills still are joining the company because of
production delays in two factories and the need for more workers.
</P>
<P>
Boeing's Washington state payroll now totals 102,000, up from
87,200 at the beginning of the year. The increase is more than the
10,000 that Boeing estimated would be added this year.
</P>
<P>
Other areas where Boeing operations employ workers include
California, St. Louis, Wichita in Kansas and Philadelphia.

<HEADLINE> Zambian MP arrested for drug trafficking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lusaka, November 25 (Xinhua) -- A Zambian parliament member
together with his son has been arrested in connection with
trafficking in mandrax, Zambia Daily Mail reported today.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman Mukutulu Sinyani of Drug Enforcement Commission
(DEC) confirmed here Monday that Patrick Kamata has been arrested

with a street value of 18.9 million Kwacha (about 14,500 U.S.
Dollars).
</P>
<P>
"The MP was arrested on November 21, 1997 following a search
at his flat No. 4 Bivex in Chingola as a result of the MP's
request to have his son Patrick Johannes Chomba Kamata searched
for suspected abuse of drugs," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Kamata is jointly charged with his son. The case is before

<HEADLINE> Nepali Currency Further Devalued </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The Nepali rupee devalued
again today, the second time in a week, after the India rupee fell
against the dollar.
</P>
<P>
The Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) today refixed the buying and
selling rates of the dollar at 60.26 rupees and 60.86 rupees
respectively from Monday's 59.75 rupees and 60.35 rupees.
</P>
<P>
Since the Indian rupee fell to a two-year low against the
dollar Monday due to the country's deepening political crisis, the
Nepali rupee, which is pegged to the Indian rupee at a fixed rate
of 1.6:1, has no other choice but to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
But the NRB, the country's central bank, did not intervene in
the market this time, as the market has adequate foreign exchange
reserves, Nepali newspapers said.
</P>
<P>
When the Nepali rupee fell against the greenback a week ago,
the NRB floated 13.5 million U.S. dollars to prop up the currency.
</P>
<P>
Since August 27, the Nepali rupee has devalued five times, and
the NRB has intervened in the market three times by floating 44.1
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Foreign reserves held by the NRB had reached about 809 million
dollars by mid-July, the NRB said.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Provides $77 Million for Lake Victoria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank has set aside
77 million U.S. Dollars for the first phase of a five-year Lake
Victoria environmental management program, the East African
Standard today quoted a bank official as saying.
</P>
<P>
Graeme Donovan, World Bank's Principal Economist in charge of
agriculture operations in eastern and southern Africa, told the
paper that the money would be used for research purposes.
</P>
<P>
The research will focus on fisheries, water quality in the
lake, management of the wetlands and the control of its
degradation through various environmental factors, he added.
</P>
<P>
Donovan was on a fact-finding mission last week in Kisumu,
west Kenya, where he met Nyanza Provincial Commissioner Wilson
Chepkwony before proceeding to Uganda and later Tanzania for
similar missions.
</P>
<P>
He noted that following a tripartite agreement among the three
east African countries of Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania on the Lake
Victoria Environmental Management Project (LVEMP) last year,
funds had now been released for the project.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 3,000 hectares of the lake is covered by the fast
growing weed of hyacinth which has negated efforts for effective
fisheries and transport, and interfered with the flora and fauna
in the lake.
</P>
<P>
On Kenya's side, the Kisumu Pier is currently closed for both
cargo and passenger transport because of the weed, and several
beaches are completely blocked for transport.
</P>
<P>
Donovan pointed out that 25 million Dollars had been allocated
to Kenya for the initial phase of the five-year project.
</P>
<P>
He said that mechanical removal of the weed is the first step
and later on followed by using biological methods, adding that
the World Bank is committed to the project's success.

<HEADLINE> Lower Reaches Of Yellow River Have Water Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The lower reaches of the
Yellow River ended a 220-day dry spell on November 21 after a dry
season and increased water use by industry and agriculture led to
drying up along parts of the river.
</P>
<P>
The situation had gotten very serious this year, and parts of
Shandong Province, where people rely on Yellow River water for
industry, agriculture, and daily use, were having a crisis.
</P>
<P>
By November, several tens of thousands of people had difficulty
obtaining drinking water. In some areas there was little water
left and the water in stock could only last until mid-November,
said local sources.
</P>
<P>
The China National Flood and Drought Prevention General
Headquarters issued an emergency circular early this month calling
for more water discharged from reservoirs on the upper reaches of
the Yellow River and an effort was made by central departments,
water conservation organizations, and provinces and autonomous
region.
</P>
<P>
This was the fourth such actions have been taken this year.
</P>
<P>
Reservoirs at Sanmenxia and Liujiaxia have increased the amount
of water discharged, and Henan, Shaanxi, and Shanxi provinces, the
Ningxia Hui and Inner Mongolia autonomous regions have reduced the
amount of water being taken from the river for industrial and
agricultural use.

GUANGZHOU, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The 250,000 motorcycles in
Shantou, in south China's Guangdong Province, have become the
major means of transportation.
</P>
<P>
According to a Bureau of Urban Construction official, the 1.07
million people living in the city's urban area own 180,000
motorcycles.
</P>
<P>
One woman who works as an accountant said that common people in
Shantou can afford motorcycles since an expensive one costs 70,000
to 80,000 yuan, and an ordinary one around 30,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Most parking lots in the city are now controlled by
motorcycles, which also cause jams on major roads during rush
hours.
</P>
<P>
The popularity of motorcycles has resulted in less use of
public transportation. Statistics show only 150 buses in the city,
while in most Chinese cities there are 7 buses for every 10,000
people.

<HEADLINE> Government Pays For Education In China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, November 25 (Xinhua) -- It is governments at various
levels, instead of the society, that provide financing for the
country's education, according a senior Chinese official in charge
of education.
</P>
<P>
"Central and local governments always take education input as
the key to education development," said Chen Zhili, vice-minister
in charge of the State Education Commission (SEC), at a national
conference on education reforms that was held recently in
Changsha, the capital of central China's Hunan Province.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that it is a mistake to think that most of China's
education funding comes from donations. "The government remains
the major patron for education," he added.
</P>
<P>
Latest statistics showed that in 1996 China spent over 226
billion yuan on education, and 167.17 billion yuan of that came
from state revenues, making nearly 74 percent of the whole
education expenditures.
</P>
<P>
China supports education by getting funds from various sectors,
a change from the past when the government was the sole backer of
the national education system.
</P>
<P>
Changsha, for example, has built 107 primary schools with
Project Hope funds and 218 special schools with 20 million yuan
(about 2.4 million US dollars) in donations over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
Project Hope was begun in 1989 and is the largest education
foundation to help dropouts return to school. It also helps build
primary schools and libraries with donations from China and abroad.
</P>
<P>
Changsha has also raised some 1.5 billion yuan from the public
during the past decade, but this is peanuts compared to government
appropriations for education, according to an official of the
Changsha City Government.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Urged to Remain Cohesive to Face Common </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Foreign
Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi today stressed the need for ASEAN
to remain cohesive when taking the initiative in addressing common
challenges that affect the region.
</P>
<P>
As ASEAN stands at the threshold of the 21st century, it is
confronted with the challenges of ensuring its dynamism and
relevance in a rapidly changing global socio-economic and
political environment, he said when opening an International
Conference on ASEAN at the Crossroads: Opportunities and
Challenges here.
</P>
<P>
Economically, he said, "The current financial and currency
turmoils that we face now bear testimony to these daunting
challenges for us to reinforce our resolve and strengthen our
political will for closer regional cooperation."
</P>
<P>
The contagion effect of the crisis has shown that no economy,
however strong, can be immune to the economic conditions in the
neighborhood, he said, adding it is therefore "not good enough" to
put one's own house in order if the neighboring economies are in
disarray and hence it is important to have regional approaches to
complement national efforts.
</P>
<P>
He said in the political, security and strategic areas, the
security environment in Southeast Asia and the wider Asia Pacific
region is "generally stable and peaceful" and the challenge for
ASEAN member countries is to entrench the positive security
environment so that economic development could continue to be the
main focus for countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the future of the region will depend very
much on how well and how quickly the economies of the members are
transformed into market-oriented ones and are simultaneously
integrated into the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) arrangement as
well as on how well they can adjust to the ASEAN way and on how
prepared the original ASEAN countries are in accommodating and
leading them.
</P>
<P>
He said that with the determination, commitment and maturity of
past and present ASEAN leaders, ASEAN has grown from strength to
strength and has succeeded in most of its endeavors over the last
three decades.
</P>
<P>
"ASEAN is slowly emerging as one of the centers in the
evolution of an emerging multipolar order," he added.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN groups Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Laos, the
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Some 40 experts from all ASEAN members except Vietnam and from
Canada and Germany are attending the two-day international
conference themed "ASEAN Challenges and Opportunities" jointly
organized by the Malaysian Institute of Economic Research and
Germany's Konrad Adenauer Foundation.
</P>
<P>
At the conference, the participants will deliberate mainly
currency crisis, the geopolitical and security challenges, the
economic challenges and ASEAN external economic relations.

<HEADLINE> Rape Cases Drop in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Rape cases have decreased
dramatically in Zambia this year compared to that of last year,
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said here Monday that about 403 cases of rape
were recorded last year while 259 cases have been reported to the
police so far this year.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the fall to the initiative taken by the police
and various non-governmental organizations in the country,
according to today's Zambia Daily Mail.
</P>
<P>
The police are no longer treating rape cases as domestic
issues, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the various non-governmental organizations have
contributed to the decrease of the rape cases by educating women
countrywide on certain issues pertaining to the safety from
rapists.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Australia today promised one
million Australian dollars (700,000 U.S. dollars) in drought aid
for the Indonesian province of Irian Jaya.
</P>
<P>
Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said half of
Australia's donation would go to a United Nations Department of
Humanitarian Affairs (UNDHA) appeal and the other half to the
International Committee of the Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
He said 400,000 people faced starvation in Irian Jaya, which
borders Papua New Guinea where 500,000 people are also at risk
because of severe drought.
</P>
<P>
"A UN (United Nations) disaster assessment team which recently
visited the worst affected areas found Irian Jaya is on the verge
of famine," Downer said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"Smoke from forest fires is severely restricting flights
carrying food into the affected regions," he noted.
</P>
<P>
"The team also reported that local water supplies are drying
out and the little water left is polluted resulting in more people
suffering diarrhea, scabies and respiratory tract infections,"
the foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
Australia has already donated 4.9 million U.S. dollars towards
drought relief in Papua New Guinea, while 2.1 million U.S. dollars
has now been committed to Indonesia for drought and forest fire
assistance.

<HEADLINE> COMESA Urged to Lift Sanctions on Burundi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The Common Market for Eastern
and Southern Africa (COMESA) has been urged to lift sanctions
against Burundi because the sanctions are hurting the interests
of the business community in the region.
</P>
<P>
Boney Katatumba, chairman of the Eastern and Southern Africa
Business Organization (ESABO), made the appeal here Monday when
he addressed the fourth meeting of the COMESA Council of
Ministers.
</P>
<P>
He noted that while COMESA countries are effecting the
sanctions, European, American and Asian business communities have
taken advantage of the vacuum to flood it with goods.
</P>
<P>
Katatumba warned that if the situation is allowed to continue
unchecked, the Burundi market could be lost for forever.
</P>
<P>
"We fear that by the time the economic embargo on Burundi is
lifted, we would have lost the market to our competitors. We
therefore appeal to the Council of Ministers to consider
alternative measures to deal with the Burundi issues." he said.
</P>
<P>
After Burundi military leader Pierre Buyoya took power from
civilian president Sylvestre Ntibantunganya in a military coup in
July last year, the sanctions were imposed to force him to
restore democracy.

<HEADLINE> Yamaichi's Singapore Units to Wind Down Operations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The three Singapore
subsidiaries of the troubled Yamaichi Securities Co. will be
voluntarily winding down their operations after the fourth largest
securities house of Japan collapsed Monday.
</P>
<P>
The three Singapore units are engaged in the securities,
futures and merchant banking operations and each of them is a
separate legal entity from Yamaichi Securities Co. in Japan, local
industrial sources said today.
</P>
<P>
A Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) spokesman has said that
the MAS, the central bank, is in close contact with Yamaichi
regarding their operations in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
The three units -- the Yamaichi Merchant Bank, Yamaichi
futures, and Yamaichi Securities (Singapore), said that all their
liabilities will be met since they had sufficient assets to do so,
but some 130 employees will lose their jobs.
</P>
<P>
A Business Times report said that it was still not certain how
long the winding-down process will take, but it is likely to go on
for a few months.
</P>
<P>
As for other Yamaichi companies in Singapore, which include
Yamaichi Asia Venture Capital and Yamaichi Research Institute, the
report said that it was not clear what will happen to them. But
Yamaichi Capital Management, which operates independently of
Yamaichi Securities in Japan, emphasized that it is maintaining
normal operations here.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Encourages Enterprises' Participation in APEC Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VANCOUVER, Canada, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President
Jiang Zemin said today that China supports and encourages the
business circle to participate in the APEC process and contribute
to the economic development of the Asia-Pacific region and the
world at large.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the remarks during a dialogue with representatives
from the APEC Business Advisory Council (ABAC).
</P>
<P>
During the dialogue, Jiang shared with ABAC members four of his
observations on the participation of enterprises in the economic
cooperation of the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
Firstly, there should be a market-oriented constructive
partnership between the government and the business sector in
every member economy; secondly, the exchanges and cooperation
between business communities in every member economy should be
further strengthened; thirdly, the participation of business
communities benefits both sides; and fourthly, scientific and
technological cooperation should be an important part of business
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that at Tuesday's informal leaders' meeting he will
propose the APEC formulate an agenda for science and technology
industry cooperation into the 21st century. The agenda is designed
to move forward APEC technical cooperation and step up the
industrial application of science and technology achievements, he
added.
</P>
<P>
On the current financial turmoil in Asia, Jiang said China
takes a positive attitude toward financial cooperation in the
region.
</P>
<P>
The ABAC was established in 1995 to increase business sector
involvement in the APEC. The ABAC has 54 members and reports to
the annual APEC informal leaders' meeting.

</P>
<P>
Caris said the whole attitude of South Africans regarding
firearms was wrong, with people believing they could secure their
lives by arming themselves.
</P>
<P>
South Africans had to learn that possessing firearms did not
guarantee their safety, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Jenni Irish, director of KwaZulu Natal-based Network of
Independent Monitors, said there was a thin line dividing
licensed and unlicensed guns as "a licensed gun today could be an
unlicensed gun tomorrow," due to negligence and theft.
</P>
<P>
She said the proliferation of illegal weapons contributed
significantly to the cyclical problem where "gun breed guns" in a
race in which different groups sought to enhance their fire
capacity either defensively or offensively.
</P>
<P>
South Africa has been troubled with the proliferation of
illegal weapons for years, which have seen increasing death and
injuries in armed robberies throughout the country.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania's Mkomazi
Reserve has received 29 two-way radion systems from a British
Africa early this month, "The Guardian" said today.
</P>
<P>
The GP-900 Motorola radio systems would enable game wardens
to make quick response if the rhinos are found in a difficult
situation.
</P>
<P>
Tony Fitzjohn, the field director for the Mkomazi Project,
said that the reserve is located in a remote and largely
inaccessible area, covering 3,500 square kilometers.
</P>
<P>
"When talking of such distances, it is essential to be able
to communicate with your team#," he said.
</P>
<P>
When poachers are sighted on the reserves the two-way radio
will ensure fast communication and a prompt call to action, even
in the most isolated areas, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
No more than 10,500 rhinos are left in the wild in the world
today, while poaching continues to be a threat, according to the
report. Tanzania has between 20 and 25 black rhions left, the
wildlife authorities said.
</P>

The four black rhinos were the first of a total of 10
expected to be transferred from South Africa to Tanzania in the

ROME, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The third stage of Operation
Olympia, the two-year investigation against the Calabrian crime
syndicate `Ndrangheta', has dealt a heavy blow to organized crime
in Italy's southernmost area, ANSA News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
A major police operation during the night saw the arrest of 72
people on charges of racketeering, murder, extortion and
loan-sharking, and about 29 have already been incarcerated, ANSA
quoted police source as saying.
</P>
<P>
Operation Olympia has brought 376 people to trial over the past
two years and another 185 are in the appeals court.
</P>
<P>
among those arrested was Giuseppe Aquila, 36, vice-president of
the province of Reggio Calabria and a local leader of the Froza
Italian party.
</P>
<P>
The Ndrangheta was defined by Pier Luigi Vigna, the current
national anti-mafia prosecutor, as the most "lethal" among Italy's
organized crime syndicates, with branches throughout Italy and
abroad.
</P>
<P>
Two years of investigation gave authorities a clear picture of
how Ndrangheta works, where it gets its money and the aggressive
strategies of the gangs, the arms suppliers and contacts in
international drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
The Ndrangheta's biggest source of income, however, comes
mainly from drug trafficking. Its newest market is in eastern
Europe where it is also able to buy heavy weapons.

GUANGZHOU, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Foods like black rice, black
sesame, and dates have begun to appear recently on Chinese dining
tables as a form of nutritional food.
</P>
<P>
At a recent seminar on these dark forms of food in Guangzhou,
the capital of Guangdong Province, experts said that these foods,
which used to be considered disgusting, unlucky, and unclean, are
now being seen as nutritional forms of food.
</P>
<P>
Lai Laizhan, a black food expert at the Ministry of
Agriculture, says that more than ten provinces are selling new
species of dark grain, and 100 factories process 200 types of this
kind of food.

He said that traditional monographs on Chinese herbal medicine
and modern scientific research both emphasize the nutritional
value of these foods, which are also popular in Japan and
Southeast Asia.

TIANJIN, November 25 (Xinhua) -- China's cosmetics market
has great potential and experts predict annual sales of 30 billion
yuan by the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
Chinese spending on cosmetics has grown fast in the past few
years, reaching 14 billion yuan last year, 40 percent more than
for 1995.
</P>
<P>
Recent studies have shown that female spending on cosmetics in
major coastal cities is approaching the international levels,
especially in Shanghai, where women spent an average of 88.8 yuan
on skin care and make-up each month.
</P>
<P>
The central government has passed laws and regulations on
the production, marketing, importing and advertising of cosmetics.
</P>
<P>
Products of foreign-funded enterprises in China now have 80
percent of the Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
The recent cutting of customs duties from 55 percent to 35
percent will stimulate more internationally-known brands to enter
the Chinese market, industry observers say.
</P>
<P>
Competitiveness will also encourage domestic companies, and the
use of both advanced technology and traditional pure natural
materials for skin protection will make domestic products more
attractive.

<HEADLINE> California Sets up Special Courts for Domestic Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, November 24 (Xinhua) -- California, the most
populous state in the United States, has set up a new kind of
court to help abused women.
</P>
<P>
There are 12 such domestic violence courts in the state, where
family support projects, probation departments, district
attorney's offices and public defenders coordinate services and
work together to make it harder for offenders to elude the system.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that as many as four million women in the United
States suffer from some kind of violence at the hands of their
husbands or boyfriends each year. The Department of Justice
estimated in 1995 that each year women were the victims of more
than 4.5 million violent crimes. Victims of domestic violence come
from all walks of life, cultures, income groups and religions.
</P>
<P>
In California, previously domestic violence cases would go from
one courtroom to another, sometimes dragging on for a year. The
"family affairs" often make it difficult for law enforcement
agencies. Usually defendants who are arrested and brought to court
have been abusing their partners for a long time. On the other
hand, victims often intercede for the defendants, asking for
restraining orders to be rescinded and cases to be dismissed.
</P>
<P>
This could eventually lead to serious consequences. This past
August, a northern California county court dismissed a battery
charge against a man called James Nivette, a 54-year-old
psychologist. His girlfriend Gina Barnett, the victim, refused to
testify. Last week the man was apprehended in France on suspicion
of murdering Barnett.
</P>
<P>
Now with the special court, there is continual monitoring and
consistent follow-up, because the same judge, public defender,
district attorney and probation officer deal with one domestic
violence case after another.
</P>
<P>
If a defendant pleads guilty, he must admit to the judge what
he did wrong. This admission is the key because he has to own up
to his violent tendencies in the mandatory counseling program,
according to the judges.
</P>
<P>
Practices vary from court to court. But usually a conviction
for first-time offenders calls for three years' probation and up
to 30 days in jail. In the first year of probation, attendance in
a violence prevention program is required. Two weeks after the
plea, the offender must report back to court and show proof that
he enrolled in the classes. If he doesn't enroll, he could be sent
to jail. 30 days later, he must return to court with a progress
report from the program. After the first progress report, if the
offender is doing well, the judge will ask him to check back with
the court every 60 days. Between court visits, probation officers
randomly visit group counseling sessions to monitor his progress.
</P>
<P>
The new kind of court was pioneered in 1993 in San Diego,
California's second largest city, where coordinated domestic
violence intervention and prevention work has been recognized as a
national model. In 1989, a coalition of over 200 people
representing some 40 agencies formed the San Diego Domestic
Violence Task Force. The task force continues its work today in
the form of San Diego Domestic Violence Council, Inc. As a result
of its work, specialized domestic violence units have been
established in the attorney offices, the probation department and
the city police department. With more than 30 detectives,
sergeants and volunteer personnel, the San Diego Police Department
has one of the largest specialized domestic violence units of any
major law enforcement agencies in the United States.
</P>
<P>
But the San Diego Domestic Violence Council said last week that
the city has become a victim of its own success. "After 10 years
of declining domestic violence homicides, the rate has increased
40 percent this year," it said. The council has recently called
for more prevention efforts in cooperation with school,
businesses, medical professionals and churches, and for ways to
make the victims safer and hold abusers accountable.
</P>
<P>
Many laws have been made and many organizations set up in the
United States to deal with domestic violence. Hundreds of books
have also been written about the subject (The University of
Washington alone lists 184 such books on the Internet). But the
problem is still there and women continue to be victimized. One
district attorney in San Francisco said that the unique problem in
domestic violence cases is dealing with people who in most
instances will continue to live together.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Border Province Popular With Russian Tourists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, November 25 (Xinhua) -- China's northeastern border
province, Heilongjiang, which shares a 3,000-km border with
Russia, has become a popular resort spot for tourists from
Russia's Far East.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, a record 30,000 people came from that part of Russia
to Heilongjiang, and in the first ten months of this year, the
number of tourists was up 10 percent from that figure.
</P>
<P>
One-day tour services first started in l988 between Heihe city
in Heilongjiang and Blagoveshchensk of Russia. Now, one- or
several-day tours are available between 14 cities in the province
and some Russian cities.
</P>
<P>
Russia is now the largest tourist market for
Heilongjiang. Before the border was open to Russian tourists, the
province was mainly a ski resort for tourists from Japan, Hong
Kong, and Macao.

<HEADLINE> Astronauts Aboard Columbia Capture Satellite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Two space-walking
astronauts from Shuttle Columbia grabbed the out-of-control
science satellite, Spartan, and brought it back to the spacecraft
Monday night.
</P>
<P>
Having waited for more than an hour for the satellite to tilt
the right way, American astronaut Winston Scott and Japanese
astronaut Takao Doi leaned over and grasped opposite ends of the
slowly spinning satellite with their gloved hands and pulled it
back to the craft.
</P>
<P>
The work in the first stage went smoothly while the craft was
flying over the Pacific Ocean at around 21:00 p.m. (0200 GMT
Tuesday).
</P>
<P>
However, the astronauts could not lower the satellite into its
cradle in the cargo bay. So Mission Control ordered the crew to
use the shuttle's robot arm to help them.
</P>
<P>
The two space-walking astronauts floated out the hatch of
Columbia at 19:16 p.m. (0016 GMT Tuesday) as the shuttle closed in
on the satellite, floating 290 kilometers above Earth.
</P>
<P>
The 10 million U.S. dollar satellite was released on Friday. It
was intended to conduct research on the sun, but for reasons that
are still unclear, it malfunctioned within moments of its release.
</P>
<P>
While the crew on Columbia tried to retrieve it with the
shuttle's robot arm, it started tumbling too quickly to be grabbed
safely. The spaceship then backed away.
</P>
<P>
After three days of separation and one hour into the spacewalk,
Columbia was back at Spartan's side. By then, Scott and Doi had
positioned themselves on opposite ends of a platform spanning the
cargo bay, their feet in restraints and their bodies leaning back
to avoid being struck by the 1.5-ton satellite.
</P>
<P>
Ground controllers planned a series of checks to determine
whether it might be feasible to send the satellite back out later
this week.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, three space walkers captured with their gloved hands a
slowly spinning communications satellite, which was three times
the size of Spartan.

<P>
ZHENGZHOU, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Henan, one of China's major
agricultural provinces, has more irrigation projects to help make
sure that the year remains disaster-free.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, 200 million work days have been spent
on irrigation projects since September, and 230 million cubic
meters of earth have been moved.
</P>
<P>
The winter water conservation efforts have cost 600 million
yuan, 78 percent more than for the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The province suffered from a serious drought this fall that
affected 3.33 million ha. of land and reduced the amount of grain
by 2.93 billion kg.
</P>
<P>
The local government has called on farmers to join the effort
by building water conservation areas, and the province has added
89,300 ha. of irrigated areas, according to local sources.

<HEADLINE> Largest Tibetan Pagoda Takes on New Look </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Beijing residents can now
visit a renovated version of the largest and oldest Tibetan
Buddhist pagoda in China, after the completion of a refurbishing
program.
</P>
<P>
The 57.9-meter tall White Pagoda in Beijing's Xicheng District
was built in 1279 (Yuan Dynasty) with the White Pagoda Temple. It
is somewhat difficult to be seen from the street because of the
high buildings that have been built around it since the late 1960s.
</P>
<P>
To increase tourism in the district, the Xicheng District
Government collected more than 30 million yuan (3.5 million US
dollars) earlier this year to renovate the pagoda, which is ten
meters taller than the Tibetan pagoda in Beihai Park.
</P>
<P>
The project meant the removal a 2,000-sq.m. grocery store and
39 families from around the pagoda and the pulling down of
several structures, which prevented people from seeing the
pagoda.

<HEADLINE> Half of Bangladeshis Feared Infected With TB Virus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 25 (Xinhua) -- More than 50 percent of the
people in Bangladesh may have been infected with tuberculosis
bacteria while at least 350,000 others get infected every year,
the World Health Organization (WHO) said in a report released here
today.
</P>
<P>
"It is likely that over half of 120 million Bangladeshis are
already infected with TB bacteria," said the report published by a
visiting WHO experts team.
</P>
<P>
It added that the directly observed treatment, short-course
(DOTS) method is the most effective weapon against the epidemic.
</P>
<P>
The WHO team, which has visited nearly 100 TB control projects
in the country over the last two weeks, noted that 80 percent of
the TB patients are being cured where the DOTS method is applied.
</P>
<P>
The field-level introduction of the DOTS strategy began four
years ago in four counties in this poor South Asian country. Now,
the method is in use in 363 counties and nearly 30,000 health
workers have so far received training in various aspects of the
DOTS strategy.
</P>
<P>
The projects have received support from the World Bank and the
government of the Netherlands while the WHO is providing technical
assistance.

<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
economic news briefs from Latin American countries over the past
few days.
</P>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO -- Uruguay has shipped 57,766 tons of beef to
neighboring countries so far this year, up 53 percent over the
same period last year.
</P>
<P>
CARACAS -- Direct capital inflow into Venezuela in October
almost tripled that of September, said the Superintendent of
Foreign Investments.
</P>
<P>
Direct investments in October reached 145.95 million dollars,
while some 50.96 million dollars were invested in the country in
September.
</P>
<P>
PANAMA CITY -- A total of 335,376 foreign visitors came to
Panama from January to September this year, an increase of 10
percent compared with the same period in 1996, said the
Panamanian Institute of Tourism.
</P>
<P>
The institute said the increase was due to the holding of a
number of international fairs in the country.
</P>
<P>
The International Airport of Tocumen, the town of Paso Canoa on
the Costa Rican border, and the seaports of Balboa and Cristobal
were the main gateways for tourists.
</P>
<P>
SAN JOSE -- The Central Bank of Costa Rica said the country's
foreign reserves in October dropped by 99.2 million dollars or 9
percent over September, the biggest decrease in the year.
</P>
<P>
Foreign currency reserves were 996.9 million dollars in
October, down from 1.96 billion dollars accumulated a month
earlier.
</P>
<P>
Rodrigo Bolanos, president of the Central Bank, attributed the
decline to the reduction of deposits in dollars from commercial
banks into the Central Bank and to foreign debt duties.
</P>
<P>
MANAGUA -- Inflation during the first 10 months of 1997 in
Nicaragua was 6.2 percent and is expected to rise to 8.2 percent
by the end of the year, the Nicaraguan Central Bank said today.
</P>
<P>
The figure was 10.1 percent in October 1996 and 12.1 percent by
the end of 1996.
</P>
<P>
Economists said inflation was lower after taxes, currency,
salaries and prices were brought under control.

<HEADLINE> APEC Leaders Urged to Send Right Signals at Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of the Asia Pacific
Economic Cooperation (APEC) are urged to send the right signals at
their summit in Canada and do the right things when they get home,
so as to help restore confidence in the region's economic
development.
</P>
<P>
"Restore confidence is key to recovery and this can only happen
when APEC governments are serious in their undertakings," said the
newspaper The Straits Times in an editorial today. "Revamping the
financial sector will cause pain, but it must take top priority in
the spring-cleaning."
</P>
<P>
It said the current financial crisis plaguing the region's
economies shows that there are serious structural problems,
particularly in the financial sector. However, it also pointed out
that the herd instinct is clearly at work in the currency and
stock markets.
</P>
<P>
"Left unchecked, this negative trend will create even more
problems for the APEC economies which are about to embark on
reforms," the editorial warned.
</P>
<P>
"If market sentiments are to change for the better, APEC
leaders must send the right signals at the summit and do the right
things when they get home," it said.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, the editorial urged the APEC leaders to endorse
a framework plan drafted in Manila last week to promote regional
financial stability.
</P>
<P>
The new draft plan, it said, provides the mechanism for
regional surveillance, better supervision and a cooperative
financing scheme that supplements the resources of the
International Monetary Fund, which should have a pivotal role in
all of this.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the editorial called on the APEC leaders to move
decisively to free up trade and investment.
</P>
<P>
"It will be the wrong thing to do" for the weakened APEC
economies to be tempted to put the brakes on liberalization, it
said.
</P>
<P>
"APEC economies, if they are to do well, must lower the
barriers, and quickly. Open up they must, for competition and
transparency will help foster growth and instill confidence," the
editorial said.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam and Russia on Monday
signed a joint statement on bilateral cooperation in economy,
trade and science and technology.
</P>
<P>
The document was signed by visiting Russian Prime Minister
Viktor Chernomyrdin and his Vietnamese counterpart, Phan Van Khai.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin's three-day visit beginning Monday is the first to
Vietnam by a Russian leader since the disintegration of the Soviet
Union in 1991.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, Vietnam's then-Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet paid an
official visit to Russia.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin and Khai also signed accords on cooperation in oil
and gas exploration, tourism and veterinary sciences.
</P>
<P>
Also topping Chernomyrdin's agenda, however, is Vietnam's
looming debt to Russia.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam owns Russia billions of rubles, but the two sides
cannot agree on what exchange rate should be used for the debt.
</P>
<P>
The Itar-Tass news agency said Russia estimates the debt at
some 17 billion U.S. dollars. When the loans were granted, the
ruble was on a par with the dollar.
</P>
<P>
But at today's rate, the debt would be 1.7 million, says
Vietnam.

<HEADLINE> Australian Fisheries Output Value Up 4 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Pearls and rock lobsters
helped push the total value of Australian fisheries production up
about four percent to 1.26 billion U.S. dollars in the last
financial year which ended on June 30, 1997, Australian federal
government's major commodity adviser said today.
</P>
<P>
Stephen Beare, acting executive director of Australian Bureau
of Agricultural and Resource Economics (ABARE), said the rise was
particularly good news following last year's estimated six percent
fall in the gross value of production.
</P>
<P>
"The increase came about mostly as a result of a 39 percent
increase in the gross value of pearl production and a 10 percent
increase in the estimated gross value of rock lobster production,"
Beare said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"Japan continues to be the major market for exports of
Australian fisheries products, accounting for 34 percent," Beare
said.
</P>
<P>
Fisheries product imports, mainly prawns, rose slightly to
about 490 million U.S. dollars in the financial year of 1996-1997.
</P>
<P>
However, despite a two percent drop in the value of exports,
Australia remained a substantial net exporter with 74 percent of
total fisheries production sold overseas, reaping about 910
million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Beare said the value of aquaculture production jumped 14
percent, mainly driven by a sharp rise in the value of pearls.

<HEADLINE> Croatia Asks U.N. Police to Stay On in Eastern Slavonia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Croatia has invited U.N.
civilian police to stay on in Eastern Slavonia, the last
Serb-controlled part of Croatia, for nine months after the U.N.
administration leaves, Croatian Deputy Foreign Minister Ivo
Sanader today said.
</P>
<P>
The Croatian government also suggested that some 180 U.N.
policemen be stationed as observers in the region.
</P>
<P>
Sanader put forward the suggestion when meeting with
ambassadors of U.N. Security Council members and ambassadors
representing the European Union countries and the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe.
</P>
<P>
The mandate of the current U.N. administration is due to expire
on January 15, after which control of the region should pass to
Croatia in accordance with a 1995 peace accord.
</P>
<P>
Sanader said Foreign Minister Mate Granic had sent a letter to
U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan proposing that U.N. police stay
on for a maximum period of nine months.
</P>
<P>
The deputy foreign minister said the proposal was aimed to
demonstrate Croatia's cooperation with the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
U.S. ambassador Peter Galbraith told reporters after the
meeting that Washington welcomed the proposal. He added that the
task of U.N. police is to ensure local police to do their duty and
protect local residents.
</P>
<P>
Eastern Slavonia, which borders Serbia, was captured by Serbs
in 1991. The Serbs have asked for the U.N. to stay on, fearing
about their future under their former rivals.

<HEADLINE> OPEC Oil Prices Continue to Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The average price of OPEC's
basket of seven crudes fell to 18.81 U.S. dollars per barrel last
week, 16 cents down from the week before, statistics released
today by the Vienna-based OPEC Secretariat showed.
</P>
<P>
The monthly average price of OPEC oil in October was 19.54
dollars per barrel, while the benchmark price OPEC set is 21
dollars per barrel.
</P>
<P>
According to the Austrian press agency, Saudi Arabia proposed
that the raising of the oil quota of daily production be discussed
at the coming ministerial meeting of OPEC to be held in Jakarta,
Indonesia's capital.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia's proposal was opposed by some OPEC members, who
are worrying that raising oil quota would cause further drop of
oil prices.
</P>
<P>
OPEC expected that in 1998, the world's average daily demand
for oil would rise to 75.80 million barrels from the 73.48 million
at present.

<HEADLINE> OPEC May Lose 600 Billion Dollars due to Carbon Tax </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC) may lose 600 billion U.S. dollars in
potential revenues by 2020 due to the carbon tax imposed by OECD,
OPEC Secretary General Rilwanu Lukman said.
</P>
<P>
Lukman said at the ASEAN Council on Petroleum (ASCOPE)
Conference and Exhibition '97 here Monday that the carbon tax
imposed in the Organization of Economic Cooperation Development
(OECD) countries would cut worldwide demand for crude oil to
between 85 million and 87 million barrels per day (bpd) by that
year.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) groups Brunei,
Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore,
Thailand and Vietnam, whereas OPEC groups Saudi Arab, Kuwait, the
United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Iran, Indonesia, Nigeria, Libya,
Algeria, Iraq and Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
According to an OPEC forecast, the world demand for crude oil
would increase by 37 percent to more than 95 million bpd by 2020
with OPEC accounting for 52 percent of the world's oil market, up
from roughly 40 percent at present.
</P>
<P>
The world demand for crude oil stood at 73.48 million bpd last
year, of which 23.033 million bpd were supplied by OPEC members.
</P>
<P>
The loss in potential revenue would considerably affect OPEC
economies and reduce their capability to expand oil production, he
said.
</P>
<P>
This, in turn, would result in oil supply shortages and price
volatility as OPEC has roughly three-quarters of the world's
proven crude oil reserves, Lukman warned.
</P>
<P>
Lukman arrived here Sunday to attend OPEC's 103rd ministerial
meeting from November 26 to December 1.

<HEADLINE> Matured Debts of Indonesian Private Businesses Reach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Bank Indonesia revealed that
at least 9.6 billion U.S. dollars of the 65 billion dollars in the
private sector's foreign debts would mature by March 1998.
</P>
<P>
At a hearing with the House of Representatives here Monday,
Bank Indonesia Governor Soedradjad Djiwandono said the amount
covered principals and interest charges.
</P>
<P>
He reaffirmed that total private foreign debts as of September
totaled 65 billion dollars. The private debts were also part of
Indonesia's total debts which amounted to 117.3 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
"However, the concern in the market is how much of the debts
are short-term, and more importantly, how much of them will mature
soon," Soedradjad said.
</P>
<P>
The central bank governor reiterated that the government, with
the help of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), would continue
to ensure enough supply of dollars on the domestic market.
</P>
<P>
The IMF has arranged a 23 billion U.S. dollar financial package
for Indonesia to support its economic reforms to survive the
current currency turmoil plaguing the region.
</P>
<P>
Soedradjad also called on the public to remain calm, asking for
their patience with and support to the government efforts to
stabilize the national currency rupiah and revive the economy.
</P>
<P>
The value of the rupiah has dropped by about 50 percent against
the U.S. dollar this year following the monetary crisis in the
Southeast Asian region.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government introduced monetary and fiscal
policies, trade deregulation and structural adjustments to
overcome the crisis. The government has also cut development
budget, rescheduled major projects and closed 16 insolvent private
banks.
</P>
<P>
"These programs are badly needed to restore our economy, which
is weakened by monetary turmoil in Asia and facing hard challenge
from the internationally integrated financial market," he noted.

<HEADLINE> IMF Urges Manila to Stop Intervention on Foreign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) has urged the Philippine Central Bank to stop intervention
on the spot foreign exchange market for lack of proof that the
local currency was in fact undervalued.
</P>
<P>
"There is no strong evidence that the peso is undervalued," the
IMF mission which came to the Philippines last week to review the
country's economic performance said in its concluding report.
</P>
<P>
The IMF instead recommended that the central monetary authority
should allow the "peso to seek its own level" rather than risk
exhaustion of the country's foreign reserves, local press today
quoted the report as saying.
</P>
<P>
"It would be imprudent for the central bank to intervene, given
the relatively low level of foreign reserves," the IMF report
stressed.
</P>
<P>
The country's gross international reserves had dwindled to 10.2
billion U.S. dollars by the end of October from a high of 12.25
billion dollars in the first quarter of the year.
</P>
<P>
The central bank sold more than 2 billion dollars to fend off
speculative attacks on the peso following a regionwide currency
turmoil sparked by the freefall of the Thai baht in early July.
</P>
<P>
The local currency already depreciated by more than 30 percent
from the level before the de facto devaluation in early July
despite the central bank's wasted effort to prop up the peso.

<HEADLINE> Thai Export Growth Predicted at 10 Percent This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Thai exports are likely to
grow by some ten percent this year in baht value due to the baht
depreciation, Thai commerce officials predicted.
</P>
<P>
The Thai export growth prediction would be lower in baht value
if the baht had not depreciated sharply since July 2 this year,
the officials said at a meeting here with local exporters Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Ministry reportedly had postponed its issuing of
1998 forecast due to the volatility of foreign exchange rates, the
officials said. The government will wait and see how weak the baht
would be at the end of this year and then decide the real export
growth for this year before making forecasts for the next year.
</P>
<P>
They also said that the government is considering setting two
export targets for the next year, one in baht value and the other
in U.S. dollar value in view of the baht volatility.
</P>
<P>
Thai exports totaled 1,205.3 billion baht during the first nine
months of this year, up nearly 15 percent year-on-year, while Thai
imports for the period posted 1,398.4 billion baht, driving the
country's trade deficit lower to 193.1 billion, down 13.6 percent
compared with the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Major Thai export goods were computers and computer parts,
garments, integrated circuits, rice and frozen shrimp, which
accounted for 27 percent of the total during the period.
</P>
<P>
Major Thai imports during the period were vehicles and parts,
transformers, motors, chemical products, and plastic resin, which
accounted for 63 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
The officials predicted that the surplus would continue for the
last quarter of this year.

<HEADLINE> Full Text of Jiang's Speech at APEC CEO Summit (Part I) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VANCOUVER, Canada, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Following is the
full text of a speech by Chinese President Jiang Zemin at the
special extended session of the APEC CEO Summit, entitled "Towards
Broader Cooperation Among Enterprises in Asia-Pacific", here today.

Mr. Chair,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
</P>
<P>
I wish to thank Prime Minister Jean Chretien for his kind
invitation which gives me an opportunity to attend today's meeting
and share my views with you on strengthened cooperation among
Asia-Pacific enterprises.
</P>
<P>
With the advent of a new century, mankind is now at an
important historical juncture. The 20th century has witnessed
tremendous economic and social progress, and the 21st century will
be full of opportunities and challenges. All of us share a
responsibility to bring a hopeful Asia-Pacific into the new
century.
</P>
<P>
An important task for APEC now is to push forward progressively
and continuously economic and technical cooperation (Ecotech)
within the region and promote a mutually reinforcing relationship
between Ecotech and trade and investment liberalization with a
view to achieving the common development and prosperity of all
countries and regions in the Asia-Pacific. China stands ready to
make positive contributions to this end.
</P>
<P>
At the 1996 APEC Informal Leadership Meeting, I made a proposal
to establish an APEC-wide network of science and technology
industrial parks to facilitate the sharing of experiences and
information exchanges in the region. China has since opened four
national level parks of this kind to APEC members together with
the Beijing environmental protection center equipped with advanced
facilities. All this shows the positive attitude that China has
adopted toward closer Ecotech in the region.

<TEXT>
<P>
Modern enterprises are an important force in propelling
economic growth and scientific research and development.
Strengthened cooperation among enterprises is an important
foundation for enhanced Ecotech within APEC.
</P>
<P>
Strengthened cooperation among enterprises in the Asia-Pacific
should follow a number of basic principles. First, a new
cooperation mechanism for the purpose of common development of
enterprises in the region should be established. It should be
based on mutual respect, cooperation on an equal footing and
mutual benefit while allowing diversity and flexibility and
sticking to dialogues and consultations. Second, different needs
of enterprises of various countries and regions should be taken
into proper consideration and their interest relations handled in
a fair and reasonable manner. Third, policies of encouraging
greater Ecotech among enterprises should be formulated and steps
taken to remove all man-made restrictive and discriminatory
measures. It can be expected that with continued efforts in
practice, Ecotech among Asia-Pacific enterprises will surely
become more extensive.
</P>
<P>
Since adopting the policy of reform and opening-up toward the
end of 1970s, China has maintained the momentum of a sustained and
rapid economic growth. The average annual growth rate is around
9.8 percent. While doing that, we have managed to bring inflation
under effective control. Right now, China enjoys political
stability, economic prosperity, ethnic harmony and social progress
and our people are living and working in peace and contentment.
</P>
<P>
China's economic achievement has injected vigor into the
economic development of the Asia-Pacific and contributed to
regional stability.

<HEADLINE> Southwestern Chinese Province To Help Large Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The government of southwest
China's Yunnan Province has decided to support 40 large
enterprises and groups as part of its efforts to create 100 large
businesses by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
At least one of the 100 will have annual sales of 10 billion
yuan, and three will have annual sales between 5 and 10 billion
yuan each.
</P>
<P>
According to Li Jiating, Yunnan's vice-governor in charge of
industry, finance and trade, 31 of the 40 businesses are
industrial enterprises that account for 65 percent of the
province's industrial sales and 90 percent of the pre-tax profits.
</P>
<P>
The success of these enterprises will help the overall economic
development of Yunnan, Li said, but they need to expand at low
cost, lower assets-to-liabilities ratio, and with better
management.

<TEXT>
<P>
Not long ago, the Communist Party of China convened its 15th
National Congress which vowed to carry forward the cause of
building socialism with Chinese characteristics pioneered by
Mr. Deng Xiaoping. The Congress laid down a master plan for the
cross-century development of China's reform, opening up and
modernization drive. Our objectives are: to double our 2000 GNP by
the year 2010 while ensuring a more comfortable life for the
people and putting in place a relatively full-fledged socialist
market economic structure; to further develop our national economy
and improve our various institutions with another 10 years of
efforts; and to realize modernization by and large and turn China
into a prosperous, strong, democratic and culturally advanced
socialist country by the middle of the next century.
</P>
<P>
The parallel development of various economic sectors with
public ownership playing a dominant role is the basic economic
system of China at the current stage. Among 8 million-plus
enterprises under various forms of economic ownership in China,
300,000 are state-owned. To rejuvenate them, we are quickening the
tempo of reform by employing all operational and organizational
methods that reflect the laws of socialized production, including
the joint stock system and joint stock partnership, and
establishing a modern enterprise system so as to give better play
to their dominant role in the economy. In addition, we are
promoting technological upgrading of the enterprises by
encouraging and guiding greater investment by enterprises and
society into technological overhaul of existing enterprises and
developing a market-oriented mechanism of new product development
and technical innovation. As for the host of difficulties and
problems we have encountered in the reform process, we are taking
vigorous steps to solve them. We are confident that under the
guidance of the sound theory and with the rich experience we have
gained in reform and thanks to the method of piloting before
popularization and the concerted efforts of all our employees, the
reform of our state-owned enterprises will surely attain its
anticipated success.
</P>
<P>
To upgrade the technology, equipment and innovation capability
of enterprises is very important for them to become more vigorous
and acquire a new mode of growth. China has introduced a project
aimed at prodding enterprises to set up an innovation system with
technology center as the focal point.
</P>
<P>
Opening to the outside world is a long-term, basic state policy
of China. We are endeavoring to improve our all-dimensional,

<TEXT>
<P>
China will continue to steadily open its market, speed up the
opening of its energy, communications and other infrastructure
industries and gradually open its service industries such as
banking and insurance. Efforts will be made to further improve
our foreign-related legal regimes, protect intellectual property
rights, improve trade and investment climate, protect the rights
and interests of foreign-funded enterprises according to law and
introduce national treatment so as to create a level playing
ground of competition for both Chinese and foreign enterprises.
Import of equipment for foreign-funded projects that tally with
China's industrial policy and can bring in new technologies will
benefit from renewed necessary preferential policies.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to rapid economic development, China has been
transformed from a seller's market to a buyer's one. For foreign
enterprises desiring to enter the China market or enhance their
market competitiveness, a financial advantage alone is not
enough. More importantly, they should back themselves with
advanced technologies and products with greater technological
contents. In the socialist market economy we are building in
China, prices of an overwhelming majority of commodities are
determined by the marketplace. This, if I may, is the important
economic information I wish to bring you today.
</P>
<P>
What you are representing here are some of the most powerful
enterprises in the Asia-Pacific and even in the world. I welcome
your broader cooperation with China in the area of new
technologies, new techniques, new equipment and advanced
management expertise, especially in the fields of high-tech
industries, infrastructure development, environmental protection
and development of human resources. This will bring benefit to all.
</P>
<P>
Let us set our eyes on the future, seize the opportunity and
work together so as to make fresh contributions to the economic
development and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific.
</P>
<P>
Thank you.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Senator Praises Construction of Three Gorges Dam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 24 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. Republican senator
today praised the construction of the Three Gorges Dam in China
for its benefit to the people and criticized the U.S. Ex-Im Bank
for not supporting U.S. firms in investing in the largest-ever
dam project in the world.
</P>
<P>
Frank Murkowski, who recently took a trip with another senator
to China, told reporters here that it was "unfortunate" that the
Ex-Im Bank stuck to the policy of not granting guaranteed loans to
U.S. firms, which were interested in the project.
</P>
<P>
Murkowski strongly refuted the Ex-Im Bank's inference that the
building of the dam would lead to environmental damage along the
Yangtze River, saying that what will happen after the completion
of the dam will be just the contrary.
</P>
<P>
"The Three Gorges Dam will generate about 18,000 megawatts,
which is equal to about 36,500 megawatt coal-fired plants," he
said. That is a great "contribution to air quality."
</P>
<P>
One of other contributions by the dam will be the benefit to
navigation, Murkowski said. "It will increase navigation, which
will provide larger vessels to have access on the Yangtze River
further up to Chongqing," the largest city in southwestern China.
</P>
<P>
The senator also refuted criticism that the building of the dam
will leave 1.7 million people displaced, saying 70 million people
were constantly displaced by the floods that occurred from time to
time.
</P>
<P>
"Those floods won't occur anymore," because of the dam, which
will be able to control the water flow, he added.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in China, Murkowski talked with President Jiang
Zemin for about one hour.

<HEADLINE> Chinese College Students Visit Drug Rehabilitation Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Twenty Chinese college
students visited a drug rehabilitation center in Beijing on
Monday to see the effects of drugs, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
The students were allowed to see the addicts' living
conditions, watch them exercise and talk with them, their
relatives and doctors.
</P>
<P>
"I am deeply impressed by them," said a student from China
University of Politics and Law.
</P>
<P>
It was part of the university's education activities examing
the topic of "drugs".
</P>
<P>
The addicts, trying to break free from narcotics, usually stay
in the center for three months.
</P>
<P>
The students had numerous questions -- why the addicts began
using drugs, where they worked before becoming addicts and what
their future goals are.
</P>
<P>
"Most of the addicts are as young as the visiting students,"
the paper quoted Chu Zhiyong, a teacher and program initiator, as
saying. "I hope the students can learn the harm of drug abuse".
</P>
<P>
The university's drug-education activities are in accord with a
circular released early this month by China's National
Narcotics Control Committee and the State Education Commission
(SEC).
</P>
<P>
The circular calls on students -- in universities and primary
and middle schools -- to participate in drug prevention education
programs.
</P>
<P>
The education program, known as "Cherish Your Life and Keep Far
Away From the Drugs," is aimed toward youth.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Calls for Better Bank Services to Customers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, November 25 (Xinhua) -- A senior Myanmar finance
official has called for giving better services to the customers,
stressing the importance of banks' role in the country's economic
progress and public confidence in banks.
</P>
<P>
While meeting with officials of state-owned banks here Monday,
Minister for Finance and Revenue Brigadier General Win Tin called
for improving dealing with the public and avoiding delay in
depositing and drawing.
</P>
<P>
The minister also urged bank staffs to keep money safe and
avoid malpractice and bad dealing with customers, citing some
complaints by the public about cases at some state-owned banks,
official newspaper The New Light of Myanmar reported today.
</P>
<P>
Win Tin warned that severe action will be taken against those
who are responsible for bad practices.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, there are six state-run banks
in Myanmar, and 25 private banks have been added since the country
reformed its financial management system in line with the
market-oriented economy introduced in the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
A total of 48 representative offices of foreign banks have been
set up in the country, and some of them plan to establish joint
ventures with local banks in light of Myanmar's entry into the
second phase of its financial reform.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Central Bank to Monitor Currency Swaps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of the
Philippines will regulate banks' swap transactions, particularly
those involving the conversion of peso placements into foreign
currency deposits.
</P>
<P>
Alberto Reyes, deputy governor of the central bank, said here
Monday that his bank is working closely with the Bankers
Association of the Philippines to draft rules and regulations on
so-called "engineered swaps".
</P>
<P>
Reyes said that the central bank is studying the possibility of
imposing a ceiling on swap transactions to discourage banks from
using this scheme in skirting central bank rules.
</P>
<P>
The rules could be worked out by the first quarter of 1998, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Swaps are agreements between two parties to swap debts so that
one meets the interest and capital payments of the other.
</P>
<P>
But engineered swaps basically involves conversion of peso
deposits into dollars and then back to pesos.
</P>
<P>
Reyes said that banks engaged in engineered swaps are able to
avoid complying with the liquidity reserve requirements imposed by
the central bank.
</P>
<P>
They also avoid paying tax by entering into engineered swap
deals, he said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientists Issuing SOS for South China Tigers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The South China tiger, a major
attraction in local zoos, could become extinct within 30 to 50
years if it does not receive adequate protection, the "China
Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
Apart from those held in zoos, field surveys in the 1980s
showed that there are 20 to 30 South China tigers in Fujian,
Guangdong, Jiangxi provinces and the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous
Region, the tigers's original habitat.
</P>
<P>
There are only five of them left in Guangdong Province, where
forest is being destroyed as a result of the fast industrial
growth, said Wang Menghu, executive deputy secretary-general of
the China Zoo Association (CZA).
</P>
<P>
The surveys discovered only some tiger tracks, excrement and
traces of urine.
</P>
<P>
"It is possible that people will no longer be able to see these
tigers in the not too distant future unless effective and concrete
measures are taken to save and protect this rare and precious
animal," the zoological expert warned.
</P>
<P>
The life span of South China tigers is 20 to 25 years. But the
tigers breed infrequently, and the survival rate of infant tigers
is low due to increasing inbreeding.
</P>
<P>
Wang attributed the reduced number of the tigers to the serious
destruction of forest as a result of rapid industrial growth and
tourism development.
</P>
<P>
To save and protect the south China tiger, Wang said the CZA
has established an information data bank, a gene bank and several
scientific research projects.
</P>
<P>
"In addition to trying to save and protect tigers in the wild,
we have to improve the breeding and rearing of future generations
of tigers in zoos, making use of such techniques as blood testing
and gene research," Wang said.
</P>
<P>
With hard work and the help of artificial insemination it is
expected that the number of South China tigers will reach 150 to 180
in the coming century, Wang said.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Accepts IMF Arrangement for Exit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government has
agreed to the suggestion of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
for a "precautionary arrangement" as the country exits from IMF
supervision by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Philippine President Fidel Ramos accepted the offer of IMF
Managing Director Michel Camdessus when they met in Manila last
week because of the uncertainties brought by the financial crisis
in the East Asian region, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
"We exit but because of this turmoil in the Asia Pacific, it
has been -- and we have accepted it -- that a precautionary
arrangement be put in place for us in a form of a special
program," Ramos said in an interview with the Washington Post
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The offer of the IMF, he said, will be necessary to safeguard
the economic growth gained by the country for the past five years
as well as prevent it from severe damage brought by the
speculative attacks on the peso.
</P>
<P>
He said the precautionary arrangement with the IMF does not
necessary mean standby fund but sharing of information, analysis
and recommendations.
</P>
<P>
The IMF's proposal will also complement the four measures
adopted by the finance ministers from the Asia Pacific at their
conference in Manila last week, he said.
</P>
<P>
The measures include a monitoring system to watch the latest
development in the region, a monetary mechanism under the auspices
of the IMF to serve as a quick response fund for economies in
distress, closer cooperation on financial matters and individual
internal reforms to be undertaken by the economy.

<P>
HAIKOU, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Environmentally-friendly buses
have made their first appearance on the streets of Haikou, the
capital of China's southernmost island province of Hainan.
</P>
<P>
The 35 new buses run on liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) instead
of petroleum, thus reducing the amount of pollutant by 80 percent and
the cost of fuel by 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
Haikou plans to spend about 30 million yuan (about 3.6 million
US dollars) on transforming 5,400 automobiles into "green buses" and
building 18 LPG stations.
</P>
<P>
The 35 new buses are all Chinese-made with advanced
technology. Officials say that LPG will be used on all buses and
most cabs in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Environmental protection departments report that pollution in
many big cities in China is mainly caused by car and truck exhaust
rather than by coal.
</P>
<P>
Green automobiles are expected to change this serious
situation and help protect the environment. Two other south China
cities, Shenzhen and Guangzhou, already have some similar buses
operating on their streets.

</P>
<P>
According to an announcement of the Philippine Stock Exchange

However, it said, an audit is still necessary for a voluntary

percent by Yamaichi of Japan.
</P>
<P>
Yamaichi is Japan's fourth largest brokerage firm which has
been battered by short-term credit crunch, shrinking business and

<HEADLINE> Olajuwon to Have Knee Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Houston Rockets center
Hakeem Olajuwon will have arthroscopic surgery on Monday to remove
damaged tissue from his left knee.
</P>
<P>
The surgery will sideline Olajuwon until the All-Star break in
February.
</P>
<P>
Olajuwon underwent an MRI that revealed a folding of tissue in
the joint capsule known as a medial plica. He was to have surgery
at Methodist Hospital in Houston performed by team physician
Walter Lowe.
</P>
<P>
A team spokesman said the injury was a result of normal wear
and tear. The Rockets expect Olajuwon to return by the All-Star
break, which begins February 5.
</P>
<P>
Olajuwon played 39 minutes in Saturday's 90-84 victory over the
Golden State Warriors, recording nine points and 13 rebounds. On
Sunday, team doctors examined him and said he possibly faced
surgery.
</P>
<P>
The Rockets were already without All-Star forward Charles
Barkley, who is out until at least Friday with a groin injury.
</P>
<P>
After some early-season bickering, Houston has won its last
three games to climb to 6-5.
</P>
<P>
The 34-year-old Olajuwon has not missed a game this season and
is averaging 14.8 points, 9.2 rebounds and 2.8 blocks. He is a
12-time All-Star who led the Rockets to consecutive NBA titles in
1994 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
The top overall pick in the 1984 draft, Olajuwon was the 1994
Most Valuable Player and the Defensive Player of the Year in 1993
and 1994. He won the MVP of the NBA Finals in 1994 and 1995.

<HEADLINE> McRae and Burns Take Joint Lead in RAC Rally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 24 (Xinhua) -- British drivers Colin McRae and
Richard Burns shared the leading place of the British RAC Rally
after the second day race on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Burns seized the lead in his Mitsubishi on the day's first
stage in Wales when overnight leader McRae ran off the road into a
ditch in heavy fog and dropped to eighth.
</P>
<P>
But Burns's choice of tyres on the central Wales gravel stages
proved poor. He lost time as McRae recovered through the day and
was hit with a 10-second penalty after leaving the 16th stage late
because of a suspension problem.
</P>
<P>
McRae's championship rival Tommi Makinen had a frustrating day
that saw him up to fourth place after the day's opening stage
before he slowly dropped back after a 120 mph spin and a
transmission problem.
</P>
<P>
The Swede, who has a heavy cold, ended the day in the sixth
spot he needs to clinch the title having been handed a 20-second
penalty for leaving the service point after stage 16 late when
mechanics replaced an output flange.
</P>
<P>
His target of sixth place looked more attainable after
then-sixth Frenchman Didier Auriol rolled out of the rally after
a mistake on the 17th stage.
</P>
<P>
McRae set the fastest time in his Subaru on five of the day's
seven stages to climb up the order after his early incident and is
within reach of the win he needs to stand a chance of taking the
championship.
</P>
<P>
Finn Juha Kankkunen ended the day in third place, but his Ford
team-mate Carlos Sainz lost time on the 18th stage after suffering
a driveshaft problem and ended the day fourth.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's final leg has more stages in southern Wales before
the finish in Cheltenham and McRae will start first because he set
the fastest time on the opening stage of the rally.

NEW YORK, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar finished
slightly higher against the Japanese yen Monday but was barely
changed against the German mark.
</P>
<P>
The closure of Japanese financial markets for a national
holiday and the upcoming Thanksgiving break kept dealings quiet,
after Yamaichi Securities, the No. 4 Japanese brokerage firm,
became the biggest Japanese company to collapse since World War II
and the third financial company to fall in less than a month.
</P>
<P>
The dollar peaked at 127.23 in the early trading, but scaled
back and settled at 126.80 yen, up from 126.40 late Friday. It
also traded at 1.7375 marks, down from 1.7384.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Economy Forecast for Moderate Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Despite the possible impact
of some negative factors such as the financial turbulence in
Southeast Asia and a trend of growing trade deficit, economists
see the United States to maintain moderate economic growth and low
inflation in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
The economy is expected to grow by an average annual rate
between 2 percent and 2.6 percent this year and next, with
inflation below 3 percent, the Journal of Commerce reported today,
quoting a report of the Commerce Department as saying.
</P>
<P>
The report, jointly conducted with a private company
DRI/McGraw-Hill, considered higher foreign trade deficit the
principal drag on the economy next year.
</P>
<P>
However, chief economist of DRI/McGraw-Hill David Wyss said the
moderate growth may continue in the next five years, making it the
longest economic expansion since World War II.
</P>
<P>
Possible reduction of U.S. exports of such items as computer
equipment and aircraft to Southeast Asia may cost U.S. output a
minor dip of about one-fourth of a percentage point, Wyss said.
</P>
<P>
Another group of 39 professional forecasters see the economy to
grow at a moderate pace at least through the year 2003.
</P>
<P>
The forecasters, belonging to the Federal Reserve Bank of
Philadelphia, pegged U.S. real GDP growth at 2.7 percent in the
fourth quarter of this year and 3.7 percent for 1997.
</P>
<P>
Growth will decelerate gradually over the next five quarters
to 2.2 percent in the fourth quarter of 1998, they said in a
survey released today.
</P>
<P>
They anticipate the inflation, measured by the Consumer Price
Index, to average 2.5 percent for the fourth quarter, 2 percent
for 1997 and 2.6 percent for 1998.
</P>
<P>
The government reported last week that the CPI rose 1.8 percent
at a seasonally adjusted annual rate in the first 10 months of
this year, against a 3.3 percent jump for 1996.

WASHINGTON, November 24 (Xinhua) -- An 18-year-old man
suspected of putting a charred cross studded with racial slurs
outside a museum of black history in Wilberforce, Ohio, was
arrested.
</P>
<P>
Daniel P. Carter, who is white, was charged with ethnic

the patrol said.
</P>
<P>
Officials at the National Afro-American Museum and Cultural

with racial slurs, "KKK" and a swastika written on it. No one saw
it burning, but the cross had been soaked with an accelerant and
was slightly charred on the back, the Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
The museum, chartered by Congress, opened in 1988 to educate
the public about black history and culture.
</P>
<P>
It is on the old campus of Wilberforce University, 20 miles
east of Dayton.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Prospects of Sino-British Relationship Look Better </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 24 (Xinhua) - Derek Fatchett, Minister of
State for Foreign Affairs, said today that Britain and China now
enjoy "a unique opportunity" to move ahead in their bilateral
relationship.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a conference "China And Britain - Partners For The
21st Century", Fatchett said that after the smooth handover of
Hong Kong, the prospects of Sino-British relationship "look better
than ever".
</P>
<P>
Why is that? Fatchett said: "I believe we have a solid basis to
build on... The successful handover of Hong Kong is a model of
what we can achieve together through trust and cooperation."
</P>
<P>
On how to further develop bilateral relations, the Minister
said: "We are also working to build a new level of cooperation
between Britain and China on global issues, such as
non-proliferation of weapons and the environment."
</P>
<P>
"No one could dispute China's key place in the world. So there
is great scope for us to work together, for example by deepening
cooperation as fellow Permanent Members of the UN Security
Council," he added.
</P>
<P>
Referring to China's accession to the WTO, Fatchett said that
with its EU partners, Britain is keen to bring China into the WTO,
assuming that China's membership can be negotiated on mutually
satisfactory terms.
</P>
<P>
He said: "China's membership of the WTO on the right terms,
will carry important benefits for China's own development, as well
as for her trading partners and for the global trading system as a
whole."

<HEADLINE> Jiang on Principles for Cooperation Among APEC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VANCOUVER, Canada, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President
Jiang Zemin today outlined three basic principles for cooperation
among enterprises in the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the APEC CEO Summit, a gathering of about 300
corporate elite of the Asia-Pacific region, Jiang said modern
enterprises are an important force in propelling economic growth
and scientific research and development.
</P>
<P>
"Strengthened cooperation among enterprises is an important
foundation for enhanced Ecotech (economic and technical
cooperation) within APEC," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He said the strengthened cooperation should follow the
following three basic principles:
</P>
<P>
First, a new cooperation mechanism for the purpose of common
development of enterprises in the region should be established. It
should be based on mutual respect, cooperation on an equal footing
and mutual benefit while allowing diversity and flexibility and
sticking to dialogues and consultations.
</P>
<P>
Second, different needs of enterprises of various countries and
regions should be taken into proper consideration and their
interest relations handled in a fair and reasonable manner.
</P>
<P>
Third, policies of encouraging greater Ecotech among
enterprises should be formulated and steps taken to remove all
man-made restrictive and discriminatory measures.
</P>
<P>
"It can be expected that with continued efforts in practice,
Ecotech among Asia-Pacific enterprises will surely become more
extensive," the Chinese president said.
</P>
<P>
He believed that an important task for APEC now is to push
forward progressively and continuously economic and technical
cooperation within the region and promote a mutually reinforcing
relationship between Ecotech and trade and investment
liberalization.
</P>
<P>
"China stands ready to make positive contributions to this
end," he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang told the chief executive officers that he made a proposal
at last year's APEC informal leadership meeting to establish an
APEC-wide network of science and technology industrial parks to
facilitate the sharing of experiences and information exchanges in
the region.
</P>
<P>
China has since opened four national level parks of this kind
to APEC members together with the Beijing environmental protection
center equipped with advanced facilities, Jiang noted.
</P>
<P>
"All this shows the positive attitude that China has adopted
toward closer Ecotech in the region," he said.

<HEADLINE> Civil Rights Fighting Internet Hate Speech </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The largest civil rights
coalition of the United States and a regional Bell telephone
company have created a Web site designed to fight Internet hate
speech.
</P>
<P>
The Leadership Conference on Civil Rights said today the site
-- www.civilrights.org -- will be maintained for two years with a
contribution from Bell Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton made a call two weeks ago at a
White House Conference on Hate Crimes to find ways to fight the
problem.
</P>
<P>
"You are providing an antidote to cyberhate," Clinton told the
civil rights coalition in a letter read by Transportation
Secretary Rodney Slater at a news conference today.
</P>
<P>
Wade Henderson, LCCR executive director, said the idea to
create a Web site was triggered by a proliferation of Internet
hate speech by groups such as the Ku Klux Klan and White Aryan
Resistance.
</P>
<P>
Bell Atlantic chairman Ray Smith cited a study by the
Anti-Defamation League showing the number of hate sites on the
Internet has doubled to 250 in the past year.
</P>
<P>
Calling the new site "an antidote for poison," he said the idea
is to "counter the frightening espousal of hatred and violence
against Americans because of their race, gender, religious or
sexual orientation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Henderson said hate groups have become more sophisticated in
communicating their doctrines and recruiting. "Instead of the
street, they recruit on the net," he said.
</P>
<P>
In addition to providing information on hate crimes around the
country, the site will explain various strategies to address those
crimes and offer materials for young people, parents and teachers
to encourage diversity.

<HEADLINE> U-2 Takes Third Flights over Iraq without Incident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 24 (Xinhua) -- A U-2 spy plane flew over
central Iraq without incident to take pictures of sites for the
U.N. weapons inspection mission, U.S. State Department said on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
"There was a U-2 flight today that took photographs of
weapons of mass destruction-related facilities," spokesman James
Foley said at a briefing.
</P>
<P>
It was the third time flight by U-2 planes within two weeks
since the outbreak of a weapons inspection dispute between the
United States and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The United States has said it will continue to keep vigilant
on Iraq despite its agreement to let U.N. weapons inspection
teams back on their work.
</P>
<P>
U.S. warplanes and warships, reinforced to the Gulf after the
crisis over weapons inspections occurred on Oct. 29, will stay in
the region and sanctions on Iraq will not be lifted until
Baghdad subjects itself to full compliance with U.N.
resolutions, U.S. officials said.
</P>
<P>
"We're still in a watching mode. We don't consider that the
issue is closed. The teams have returned, they've started their
work and let's see whether they're able now to work more
effectively," Foley said.
</P>
<P>
A new dispute erupted as the U.N. weapons inspectors, who
returned to Iraq last Friday, insisted to check some sites that
the Iraqi authority claimed belonged to presidential area and
would not be allowed to enter as sensitive areas.
</P>
<P>
Foley said Iraq had no right to limit the scope of
inspections. "No sites is to be off limits to UNSCOM (U.N.
Special commission) in the performance of its mission," he said.

<P>
VANCOUVER, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang
Zemin said today that China is ready to make joint efforts with
the Republic of Korea (ROK) to bring the energetic, healthy and
steady bilateral ties into the next century.
</P>
<P>
At his meeting with ROK President Kim Young Sam here today,
Jiang noted the rapid growth of Sino-ROK political, economic,
trade and other relations since diplomatic relations were
established five years ago.
</P>
<P>
China is satisfied with its fruitful relations with the ROK,
Jiang told Kim.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president also spoke highly of Kim's valuable
contribution to the Sino-ROK friendly neighborhood and the steady
development of bilateral ties, according to Chinese officials.
</P>
<P>
At the turn of the century, China is willing to join the
efforts of the ROK in bringing the energetic, healthy and steady
ties of friendly neighborhood into the new millennium, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
The ROK president expressed his agreement and voiced the hope
that ROK-China cooperation in all fields will be further
strengthened.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Kim also congratulated Jiang on China's
success in the diplomatic front, noting the Sino-U.S. summit, the
Russian president's trip to China and the Chinese premier's visit
to Japan.
</P>
<P>
Both agreed that through meetings on various occasions, the two
countries' leaderships have established good working relations,
