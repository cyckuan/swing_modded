PIAZZA TO RETURN TO DODGER STADIUM
</HEADLINE>
 (or use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRANK GIRARDOT  
 c.1998 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ow that the Montreal Expos have left town, the
Los Angeles Dodgers are ready to take on the New York Mets and
their former catcher, Mike Piazza.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a big series for us,'' Dodgers manager Glenn
Hoffman said. ``There's going to be some electricity; there was a
lot when we went to New York. You know we need a big series.''
</P>
<P>
   Told that Piazza hit a home run Thursday against the San
Francisco Giants, Hoffman rolled his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``That means he's swinging the bat better now,'' Hoffman said.
</P>
<P>
   Then turning toward the visitor dugout at Dodger Stadium,
Hoffman remarked, ``Coming in from the other side might cool him
off a bit.''
</P>
<P>
   The return of Piazza has bolstered ticket sales at Dodger
Stadium. As many as 150,000 fans are expected to attend the
four-game weekend series, officials said. Going into Thursday, the
Dodgers were seven games behind the Mets in the race for the
National League wild-card berth. So will this be the highlight of
the Dodgers homestand?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that they are all big. We got the Giants coming up at
the end, the Phillies are right there. We're fighting to try to get
back into it. They are all important,'' Hoffman said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Been there: Dodgers second baseman Eric Young's game-winning
solo homer with two outs in the ninth Wednesday shouldn't have been
too surprising.
</P>
<P>
   Although it was just his fifth home run of the season, it was
the third time in 1998 that Young slugged the game-winner. In all,
four of Young's five home runs have either tied games or given the
Dodgers the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Three of Young's homers have come in the last 11 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been hot,'' Hoffman said. ``That one (Wednesday) was a
slider out and away he carried to right. For momentum-wise it was
perfect. He's really swinging the bat well.''
</P>
<P>
   __ On the mend: Right-hander Ismael Valdes made his second rehab
start in San Bernardino on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Infielder Tripp Cromer, coming back from surgery on his right
elbow, will also play at least five innings at second base, Hoffman
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see how he comes out of that and whether or not to bump
up the playing time,'' Hoffman said.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night's game was the final meeting between the Dodgers
and Expos. Going into the game the Dodgers were 4-1 against the
Expos at home; 4-4 overall.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Grudzielanek, who went hitless Wednesday night, did not
start Thursday's game. Juan Castro was inserted into the lineup by
Hoffman.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're giving Juan the start,'' Hoffman said.
``(Grudzielanek's) feet are a little sore and we're going to get
him ready for the (next) series.''

FILES FLY AS INTERIOR DEPARTMENT ANSWERS BABBITT SUBPOENAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By ADRIANNE FLYNN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Interior Department and at least one Indian
tribe are busy gathering documents to comply with a flurry of grand
jury subpoenas issued in the independent counsel investigation of
Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, sources have told ``The Arizona
Republic''.``''
</P>
<P>
   The House Government Reform and Oversight Committee also has
turned over all the documents it collected for two weeks of
hearings on the Babbitt matter early this year. Its staff met with
some of the half-dozen lawyers that independent counsel Carol Elder
Bruce has hired to conduct the probe, even though it has questions
about Bruce's choice of two attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   And Bruce has circulated a list of witnesses that she might want
to talk to before the probe is completed, sources familiar with the
investigation have told ``The Republic''.
</P>
<P>
   As the nation's attention has been focused on the work of
Kenneth Starr, the independent prosecutor investigating President
Clinton's relationship with former White House intern Monica
Lewinsky, the Babbitt investigating team has quietly gone about its
business. The word is that the independent counsel wants to reach a
conclusion about the case by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Interior is sagging under demands to comb four years of
electronic mail messages for those concerning the decision at the
heart of the Babbitt investigation: the July 14, 1995, denial of a
casino license for a Wisconsin tribe, according to department
employees who declined to be identified.
</P>
<P>
   E-mail messages among Interior staff on changing the rationale
behind the decision were seized upon by House investigators as
evidence of political influence on the denial.
</P>
<P>
   Interior also has been ordered to provide voluminous information
on taking land into trust for tribes, something a favorable casino
decision would have required, and to come forth with reams of
documents on Indian gaming.
</P>
<P>
   The Interior Department declined to talk about the investigation
or any subpoenas.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt, a former Arizona governor, is accused of lying in a
Senate hearing about the casino decision. Attorney General Janet
Reno asked that an independent counsel be appointed to investigate
the perjury allegations, and whether the underlying decision was
``criminally corrupted.'' Bruce was appointed in March.
</P>
<P>
   House and Senate investigators have said the denial was
influenced by political contributions to Democrats from opposing
tribes trying to protect their own gambling interests from
competition.
</P>
<P>
   At least one, and perhaps two of the opposing tribes have been
subpoenaed for documents relevant to the inquiry, sources in
contact with tribal officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Three bands of Chippewa Indians were asking Interior to allow
them to build a casino at a failing Hudson, Wis., dog track owned
by a Florida gaming company. Oneida, Sioux and another band of
Chippewas, which operated their own gaming facilities nearby,
opposed the application. These opposing tribes contributed more
than $300,000 to Democrats in the 1996 election cycle.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Republicans on the House committee that investigated
Babbitt are concerned about Bruce's hiring of two attorneys, Barry
Coburn and David Schertler, who were partners in a Washington firm.
Coburn's hiring in particular irks the committee. It was he who
advised leaders of the Cheyenne-Arapaho tribe to claim Fifth
Amendment protections from self-incrimination in Senate testimony
about Clinton administration solicitation of contributions from
Indian country.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is a bit too close to the one he's currently charged
with investigating, although the committee members, who declined to
be identified, stop short of calling it a conflict. &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Following are excerpts from the charges against
Mohamed Rashed Daoud al-'Owhali as filed in U.S. District Court and
unsealed Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
</P>
<P>
   V. MOHAMED RASHED DAOUD AL-'OWHALI a/k/a `Khalid Salim Saleh Bin
Rashed,'
</P>
<P>
   Defendant
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   2. From in or about March 1998 through the date of the filing of
this complaint, outside the jurisdiction of any particular state or
district, Mohamed Rashed Daoud al-'Owhali, a.k.a. ``Khalid Salim
Saleh bin Rashed,'' the defendant, together with others known and
unknown, unlawfully, willfully and knowingly combined, conspired,
confederated and agreed together and with each other to murder the
occupants of the United States Embassy Compound, Nairobi, Kenya, in
the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United
States, as that term is defined in Title 18, United States, Code,
Section 7(3).
</P>
<P>
   3. In furtherance of the conspiracy and to effect the object
thereof, the defendant and others committed the following overt
acts, among others:
</P>
<P>
   a. On or about July 31, 1998, Mohamed Rashed Daoud al-'Owhali,
a.k.a. ``Khalid Salim Saleh bin Rashed,'' the defendant, traveled
from Lahore, Pakistan to Nairobi, Kenya;
</P>
<P>
   b. On or about Aug. 4, 1998, Mohamed Rashed Daoud al-'Owhali,
a.k.a. ``Khalid Salim Saleh bin Rashed,'' the defendant, together
with others known and unknown, reconnoitered the Embassy.
</P>
<P>
   c. On or about Aug. 7, 1998, Mohamed Rashed Daoud al-'Owhali,
a.k.a. ``Khalid Salim Saleh bin Rashed,'' the defendant, along with
a co-conspirator not charged herein, traveled in a vehicle
containing an improvised explosive device from a location in
Nairobi, Kenya to the embassy.
</P>
<P>
   d. On or about Aug. 7, 1998, Mohamed Rashed Daoud al-'Owhali,
a.k.a. ``Khalid Salim Saleh bin Rashed,'' the defendant, threw a
small grenade-like device toward a guard stationed outside the
embassy.
</P>
<P>
   Count 14: Use of Weapons of Mass Destruction
</P>
<P>
   4. From in or about March 1998 through the date of the filing of
this complaint, in Nairobi, Kenya and outside the jurisdiction of
any particular state or district, Mohamed Rashed Daoud al-'Owhali,
``Khalid Salim Saleh bin Rashed,'' the defendant, together with
others known and unknown, unlawfully, willfully, and knowingly, and
without lawful authority, combined, conspired, confederated and
agreed together and with each other to use and threaten to use,
weapons of mass destruction, against property that is owned,
leased, and used by the United States, to wit, the defendant
conspired to detonate an improvised explosive device inside and in
the vicinity of the United States Embassy Compound, Nairobi, Kenya.
...
</P>
<P>
   The bases for my knowledge and the foregoing charges are as
follows:
</P>
<P>
   5. I have participated in the investigation of the
above-captioned matter, and have spoken with other individuals,
including Federal agents, other law enforcement officials, and
other witnesses. When I rely on statements made by others, such
statements are related in part and in substance unless otherwise
indicated. Moreover, because this affidavit is submitted for the
limited purpose of establishing probable cause supporting the
arrest of the defendant, I have not set forth each and every fact
learned during the course of this investigation.
</P>
<P>
   6. On Aug. 7, 1988, at approximately 10:30 A.M. local time, a
massive explosion occurred in the vicinity of the United States
Embassy in Nairobi, Kenya, demolishing a secretarial college
adjacent to the rear of the embassy and severely damaging both the
embassy and a nearby building. At least 258 persons were killed,
including 12 United States nationals.
</P>
<P>
   7. On or about Aug. 9, 1998, the defendant was contacted in
Nairobi by Kenyan officials. At the time the defendant was
contacted, he appeared to have suffered several injuries, including
lacerations and abrasions about the hands and face, as well as a
large wound on his back. The defendant was subsequently taken into
custody by Kenyan officials.
</P>
<P>
   8. On or about Aug. 12, 1998, after having been arrested by
Kenyan officials, Mohamed Rashed Daoud al-'Owhali, a.k.a. ``Khalid
Salim Saleh bin Rashed,'' the defendant, was advised of his Miranda
rights by Special Agents of the F.B.I. After waiving those rights,
the defendant stated, among other things, that he was standing in
the bank near the embassy on the day of the bombing with a
companion. Defendant also claimed that the clothes he was wearing
when arrested were the same clothes that he was wearing on the day
of the bombing, despite the fact that his clothes bore no traces of
blood from defendant's injuries. The defendant later admitted,
however, that the clothes he was wearing on the day of his arrest
were not the clothes he was wearing at the time of the bombing. On
or about Aug. 20, 1998, again after having been read his rights,
and after having waived those rights, the defendant made additional
statements concerning the bombing of the embassy.
</P>
<P>
   9. On or about Aug. 20, 1998, the defendant stated among other
things, the following:
</P>
<P>
   a. That he was trained in a number of camps in Afghanistan,
including a number of camps affiliated with al Qaeda, an
international terrorist group, led by Osama bin Laden, dedicated to
opposing non-Islamic governments with force and violence.
</P>
<P>
   b. The defendant stated that, while in the Afghanistan camps, he
was trained in explosives, hijacking, and kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
   c. He attended conferences and meetings with Osama bin Laden,
including a press conference, in Khost Afghanistan, which followed
a recent interview of bin Laden by ABC News. The defendant also
stated that he was aware of a fatwah against the United States by
the International Islamic Front which was signed by Osama bin Laden
and the leaders of other jihad groups, stating that it was proper
to kill Americans worldwide. ...
</P>
<P>
   d. His role in the Aug. 7, 1998, bombing of the embassy
included, among other things: traveling in late July from Lahore,
Pakistan to Nairobi, Kenya; reconnoitering the embassy on Aug. 4;
traveling with a co-conspirator in a vehicle containing an
improvised explosive device from a location in Nairobi, Kenya to
the embassy on the morning of the bombing; and tossing a
grenade-like device (which did not include fragmentation casing) at
a guard stationed at the embassy.
</P>
<P>
   e. The defendant also stated that the operation was supposed to
be a martyrdom operation, which he did not expect to survive.
</P>
<P>
   10. The defendant also stated that, while being treated at a
local hospital for the injuries he sustained from the blast, he
discarded in a hospital bathroom 2 keys that fit the padlock on the
rear of the bomb-laden vehicle, and 3 bullets for a gun he had left
behind in the vehicle. Employees of the hospital where the
defendant was treated recovered 2 keys and 3 bullets in the area
described by the defendant. &QL;

FDA APPROVES A DRUG THAT BLOCKS A GENE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (js) 
 By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration has approved the first drug
that works by blocking the action of a gene.
</P>
<P>
   Isis Pharmaceuticals Inc., a biotechnology company in Carlsbad,
Calif., said it had received approval late Wednesday for its drug,
fomivirsen, for the treatment of CMV retinitis, a virus that can
cause blindness in AIDS patients. Fomivirsen will be made by Isis
and marketed as Vitravene by Ciba Vision Corp., the eye-care unit
of Novartis AG, the Swiss pharmaceutical giant.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Isis rose 56.25 cents Thursday, to $9.8125, in Nasdaq
trading.
</P>
<P>
   Vitravene is based on a technology known as antisense, which
holds great promise for harnessing genetic information to make
potent drugs with few side effects. Antisense drugs, which are
essentially snippets of DNA that switch off genes that prompt cells
to produce disease-causing proteins, could in theory treat all
manner of infections, inflammatory diseases and cancers. But it has
been difficult to make the technology work in practice, and the
field has been beset by skepticism that it could work at all.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA's rapid approval, which comes just five months after the
application for Vitravene was submitted, ``should give people more
confidence in the antisense platform as a way to make drugs,'' said
Paul Boni, an analyst with Punk, Ziegel &AMP; Knoell. ``With any brand
new technology, you never know when the world will be ready for
it,'' he said. ``This could be the first important step for
antisense to get accepted.''
</P>
<P>
   The size of the market for Vitravene is not clear because the
incidence of CMV retinitis has been in decline as AIDS patients
live longer, healthier lives thanks to antiviral drugs. But recent
studies show many patients either resisting or not tolerating those
drugs, so infections like CMV retinitis may increase. Some analysts
expect the market to be less than $20 million.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Vitravene is injected directly into the eye, where it interferes
with the replication of the cytomegalovirus, which destroys the
retina. The side effects of Vitravene are minimal, while existing
therapies are extremely toxic, so it could become the primary
therapy for the disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very exciting from a patient-care point of view,'' said
Dr. Debra Goldstein, an assistant professor of ophthalmology at the
University of Illinois and a principal investigator on Vitravene.
``All of the other drugs we have are very similar, so if you are
resistant to one there's a chance you're resistant to all of them.
This acts by a whole new mechanism.'' The only side effects are
some inflammation and pressure in the eye, both of which are
temporary and treatable, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Because Vitravene is administered directly into the eye instead
of into the body, it may not silence the skeptics, and some may say
that while it works, it does not work by antisense. But Isis has
other drugs, including a treatment for the inflammatory bowel
condition known as Crohn's disease and two cancer drugs, in
clinical trials. Those drugs are injected into the body, and the
company is also working on second- and third-generation antisense
compounds that could be given orally.
</P>
<P>
   The success of Vitravene ``is one more piece in a mosaic of
evidence that antisense can be used to make drugs,'' said Stanley
Crook, the chairman and chief executive of Isis. ``By itself, it is
not enough to make me say that antisense will be the revolution I
believed it would be, but it is an important piece. The evidence is
overwhelming that antisense can work.''

SOPHOMORE POLAK RISES TO OCCASION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ UCLA's biggest player has the biggest
responsibility _ protecting quarterback Cade McNown's blind side _
and right tackle Brian Polak is not taking it lightly.
</P>
<P>
   Polak, a 325-pound sophomore, prepared for his role by rising at
5 a.m. daily this summer and commuting to Westwood from his home in
Hacienda Heights. His workouts began at 6 a.m., with 90 minutes of
conditioning followed by two hours of weight training. He was one
of 40 players who had perfect attendance in the summer program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brian did a lot of maturing this summer,'' strength coach
Kevin Yoxall said.
</P>
<P>
   To help secure the job _ and McNown's back _ Polak got stronger,
quicker and tougher. He played in 10 games last year as a true
freshman, relieving All-American Chad Overhauser and was the best
of an inexperienced bunch during spring drills. But UCLA signed a
junior college transfer, James Ghezzi, from Glendale College, in
case Polak wasn't ready.
</P>
<P>
   The summer commutes allayed their fears.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got here (a few weeks ago), all the coaches took one
look at me and said, `Wow, you look a lot better,''' Polak said.
``I just rededicated myself. I had a great opportunity ahead of me,
and I knew if I worked hard I could contribute.''
</P>
<P>
   Polak, a Bishop Amat graduate, entered training camp as the
starter. He's smart and possesses remarkably quick feet for a
325-pounder. Although he added five pounds this summer, his body
fat decreased. With more muscle and less fat, his agility improved.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he continues to improve through the rest of fall camp, then
we'll be very good at right tackle,'' line coach Mark Weber said.
</P>
<P>
   __ How they stand: Health allowing, Weber wants to rotate 10
players for the five line spots. The starting five is established,
from left to right: Kris Farris, Oscar Cabrera, Shawn Stuart, Andy
Meyers and Polak.
</P>
<P>
   The top reserves are Matt Phelan, who can play either guard
position, and Ghezzi, who can play either tackle. Beyond those
seven, the competition is fierce.
</P>
<P>
   Freshman Blake Worley has scaled the depth chart and is
entrenched as the fourth tackle ahead of David Wilford. ``He's big
and strong and very far along, physically,'' Weber said of Worley.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, freshman Mike Saffer is challenging Ed Anderson for
the fourth guard spot.
</P>
<P>
   Troy Danoff is the backup center, but Stuart is expected to take
at least 90 percent of the snaps.
</P>
<P>
   ``Troy had a good spring and is legitimately in the two deep,
but it's hard to rotate the center,'' Weber said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Movin' up: Freshman cornerback Julius Williams, who played
with DeShaun Foster at Tustin, is a pleasant surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a guy we thought would probably redshirt, but he has
impressed us enough that he might not,'' coach Bob Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   Williams is third on the depth chart at right cornerback, behind
Jason Bell and Ryan Roques.
</P>
<P>
   __ Walendy update: Starting fullback Craig Walendy continues to
recover from an allergic reaction to insect bites and has not
practiced. But he is expected to play against Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're playing it safe,'' he said. ``At this point, I could
play. But if something went wrong, it would jeopardize quite a bit
of the season. If we give them time to heal, then it's just a
matter of a week.''

<P>
   CARMEL, Calif. _ It wasn't a dark and stormy night, but it was a
dark and winding road. There were no street lights along the
mountain highway outside Carmel; there were only a few houses,
widely spaced. Suddenly, a person in a black coat darted in front
of the Cadillac DeVille prototype I was driving.
</P>
<P>
   I could see him with my naked eye only when I was within several
feet of him. By then, he was already across the road.
</P>
<P>
   I breathed a sigh of relief that I had been aware of his
presence. For I had actually spotted him sooner, while the car was
several yards back down the road, thanks to the Cadillac's Night
Vision display.
</P>
<P>
   The fleeting figure who interrupted my test drive proved the
point that General Motors' Cadillac Division was trying to make:
that its Night Vision system allows a driver to see three to five
times farther down the road than he or she would with only the low
headlight beams. That extra distance gives the driver more time to
react to an impending, dangerous situation.
</P>
<P>
   Cadillac, which demonstrated the system recently in California
and Washington, plans to be the world's first automaker to offer a
night vision system on a production vehicle. The system will be an
option on the next-generation DeVille, which is scheduled to go on
sale in about a year as a 2000 model.
</P>
<P>
   The DeVille will be the only GM vehicle to have the system
initially, though Cadillac executives acknowledged that the
technology could be expanded to other models. Cadillac has
historically led other GM divisions in the introduction of features
like air bags, anti-lock brakes and stability controls.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Zellner, chief engineer of the 2000 DeVille, noted that
although nighttime driving represented only about a quarter of all
driving, it accounted for more than half of all traffic deaths and
62 percent of pedestrian fatalities, according to the National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration. In addition, vehicles often
strike deer and other animals at night _ more than 300,000
collisions with deer are reported annually, and many others go
unreported.
</P>
<P>
   ``Visibility is a major factor,'' Zellner said. Improving
visibility by three to five times, as Cadillac says its night
vision system does, means more time to react to a deer. At 60 miles
an hour, reaction time increases from 3.5 seconds without night
vision to nearly 15 seconds with it, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nighttime is like drawing the curtain around a car,'' Zellner
said. ``But Night Vision draws back the curtains.''
</P>
<P>
   Night-vision technology was developed in the 1960s for the
military. The earliest systems were very expensive _ about $1
million each _ and could not cope with the heat of an automobile
engine. The technology has since been refined and the cost has
dropped sharply; night-vision goggles are now on the shelves of
discount stores.
</P>
<P>
   During the Persian Gulf war, fighter pilots used the technology
to home in on targets in the dark, a scene made familiar in
newscasts. Since then, night vision has been adapted for use in law
enforcement, like border patrols, as well as by fire departments
and marine rescue missions.
</P>
<P>
   In the DeVille prototype, a sensor that looks like a camera lens
peeks out of the grille. The unit, developed by Raytheon Systems
Co., uses infrared technology to detect the heat emitted by objects
_ like people, animals or moving vehicles _ that may be invisible
to the eye. Indeed, the amount of background light is irrelevant,
since the device ``sees'' only heat.
</P>
<P>
   The heat-sensitive image is projected onto the lower portion of
the DeVille's windshield, much like the heads-up display that gives
a speedometer reading in cars like the Pontiac Grand Prix GTP. The
image is in black and white, but in reverse. ``Hot'' objects, like
animals and people, appear white; ``cool'' objects, like the trees
lining the road, appear dark. The man in the dark coat who darted
in front of me appeared as a bright white image on the display.
</P>
<P>
   Because the system recognizes heat but not light, it ignores the
approaching headlights that can produce a blinding glare. In the
demonstration of the Cadillac system, a car came toward me with its
high beams on, but Night Vision did not show the headlights at all.
I could see the car, though, and because the image was glare-free,
I could tell there was no other vehicle behind it. In rain and fog,
engineers said, the picture may be more fuzzy, but the system still
works, essentially seeing through the elements.
</P>
<P>
   Night Vision powers up automatically. The headlights must be on,
and the Twilight Sentinel feature, which turns the lights on when
it detects darkness, must sense that it is nighttime. The
projection on the windshield can be adjusted up or down to suit the
height of the driver. Or it can be turned off if it is distracting
or unneeded _ as it would be on well-lighted city streets.
</P>
<P>
   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has not
studied Cadillac's night vision system, a spokesman, Phil Frame,
said. But a recent study done for the safety administration by
Scientex, an Alexandria, Va., consulting firm that conducts studies
on highway safety issues, indicated that a night vision system
might indeed benefit drivers. Ken Gish, Scientex's senior human
factors psychologist, said the studies showed that a driver using
such a system could see 1,200 feet beyond the range of the naked
eye.
</P>
<P>
   In the tests, conducted with a video monitor instead of a
heads-up display like Cadillac's, older drivers were less willing
to use the system. Younger drivers were more likely to use it and
realized the most benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, Cadillac engineers said, the Night Vision system should
be used as a backup. The driver should primarily rely on his or her
own vision, and glance at the night display on occasion, as he or
she would look at the rear view mirror. But I found myself focusing
on the night vision screen, only occasionally looking up at the
real world.
</P>
<P>
   Cadillac did not disclose a price for its system, though it is
likely to cost from $1,500 to $2,000. Executives said they expected
about 5 percent of DeVilles to be ordered with it.

NASCAR REDUCING TO TWO MEN

<P>
   Figures.
</P>
<P>
   If anybody was going to stop Jeff Gordon's four-race win streak,
it had to be Mark Martin, who did just that with his victory in
last Saturday's Goody's 500 at Bristol, Tenn. After all, one or the
other of the Winston Cup Tour's top two drivers has won six of the
past seven races.
</P>
<P>
   With the victory, Martin narrowed the gap between himself and
points leader Gordon to 67 points. And he extended a couple of
streaks of his own.
</P>
<P>
   It was Martin's 13th straight top-10 finish. And he is the only
driver among the top 14 to not have suffered a DNF (Did Not Finish)
so far in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon finished fifth in the race after battling an
ill-performing car all day long. But Martin was the only driver to
make a significant gain on him. The season points race has thus
become essentially a two-man battle with 11 races remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Dale Jarrett, running third, 223 points behind Gordon, said it's
time to step up the pressure on the leaders or start thinking about
next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to catch those two before it's too late,'' Jarrett
said. ``What we need is some wins and for them to have some
trouble. If not, we might as well forget about this championship.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Giving back: Like many racers, Valencia product Bryan Herta
got his start racing go-karts.
</P>
<P>
   Herta, who drives on the FedEx CART circuit for Team Rahal,
announced this week that he has purchased an interest in the Las
Vegas Karting Center in Sloan, Nev., with the intent of helping
young drivers get started.
</P>
<P>
   ``The center will host a number of national karting events as
well as establishing a first-class karting school,'' said Herta,
who began racing go-karts at 12. ``We want to help develop more
young racing talent at our center.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Musical chairs: Max Papis became the third driver to depart
the Arciero-Wells CART race team this year when he announced this
week he won't return in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Papis, who replaced La Canada's Jeff Krosnoff with the team
following Krosnoff's fatal crash in 1996, is rumored to be a
leading candidate to take over driving duties for Bobby Rahal, who
is retiring at the end of this season.
</P>
<P>
   Papis' departure follows those of Hiro Matsushima, who has
retired, and Robby Gordon, who will pursue other driving
opportunities next year. Scott Pruett recently signed with
Arciero-Wells to fill one of the vacancies.
</P>
<P>
   __ Starting over: His once-intimidating lead gone, Granada
Hills' M.K. Kanke heads to Saturday's NASCAR Southwest Featherlite
Tour NAPA 125in Colorado in second place.
</P>
<P>
   Kanke, the victim of three straight DNFs, now trails Steve
Portenga by 43 points (1,458-1,415) with six races remaining.
Despite his recent run of ill fortune, he remains optimistic about
winning this season's Southwest title.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the end of the season, we'll be back up there,'' Kanke
said. ``The reason we did so well at the beginning is all the other
guys had problems. We all have our ups and downs.''
</P>
<P>
   Kanke is also encouraged by returning to Colorado National
Speedway (Erie, Colo.). The track is home to his team, Bonicelli
Racing of Colorado Springs, and is the site of previous Kanke
victories.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won last year's race there,'' Kanke said. ``I think we can
win again.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Father vs. son: With Dale Earnhardt Jr. leading the NASCAR
Busch Grand National tour, there is a pretty good chance he and his
racing icon father, Dale Sr., could face off against each other as
members of next year's International Race of Champions tour.
</P>
<P>
   If that comes to pass, their first IROC event will likely not be
the first time they have raced against each other. That day is
supposed to come Nov. 22 in Japan, when the two Earnhardt's run in
the NASCAR Thunder Special Coca-Cola 500.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might be really weird the first time I try to pass him on
the track _ if I get a chance to pass him,'' the younger Earnhardt
said. ``But it is something that will be exciting for both of us,
I'm sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt Sr. said he has fond memories of his only time racing
his father, Ralph Earnhardt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got one exciting time racing with my dad and it was pretty
neat,'' he said. ``It is exciting to see Dale Jr. grow into the
sport and it will be a great experience to race him in Japan.
However, it wouldn't look very good for him to beat his old dad
now, would it.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Nuts and bolts: After running as high as fourth at the Indy
Racing League Radisson 200 at Pikes Peak on Aug. 16, Roberto
Guerrero has been signed to finish the season for the CBR team....
Road racer Ron Fellows will be in the Winston Cup No. 96
Caterpillar Chevy at the CMT 300 Sunday in place of Hut Stricklin,
who is recuperating from torn cartilage in his chest.... La
Canada's Tommy Kendall was part of a three-man team that claimed
fifth place last weekend at the First Union Six Hours at the Glen
road race at Watkins Glen, N.Y. Kendall's team started 10th....
Canyon Country's Jay Drake won the 50-lap USAC sprint car EMGE Joe
James/Pat O'Connor Classic at Salem, Ind., Sunday.... Tony Stewart
practiced at the Atlanta Motor Speedway on Thursday, ending rumors
his team might skip the event to protest a 15-point penalty
assessed them by IRL officials this week. The IRL docked Stewart
and teammate Robbie Buhl for using illegal rear wings in the Aug.
16 Radisson 200. The loss of points moved Stewart from first to
third in season points.

AUTO TECHNOLOGY: SHINING INFRARED LIGHT ON OBJECTS IN SHADOWS

<P>
   CARMEL, Calif. _ It wasn't a dark and stormy night, but it was a
dark and winding road. There were no street lights along the
mountain highway outside Carmel; there were only a few houses,
widely spaced. Suddenly, a person in a black coat darted in front
of the Cadillac DeVille prototype I was driving.
</P>
<P>
   I could see him with my naked eye only when I was within several
feet of him. By then, he was already across the road.
</P>
<P>
   I breathed a sigh of relief that I had been aware of his
presence. For I had actually spotted him sooner, while the car was
several yards back down the road, thanks to the Cadillac's Night
Vision display.
</P>
<P>
   The fleeting figure who interrupted my test drive proved the
point that General Motors' Cadillac Division was trying to make:
that its Night Vision system allows a driver to see three to five
times farther down the road than he or she would with only the low
headlight beams. That extra distance gives the driver more time to
react to an impending, dangerous situation.
</P>
<P>
   Cadillac, which demonstrated the system recently in California
and Washington, plans to be the world's first automaker to offer a
night vision system on a production vehicle. The system will be an
option on the next-generation DeVille, which is scheduled to go on
sale in about a year as a 2000 model.
</P>
<P>
   The DeVille will be the only GM vehicle to have the system
initially, though Cadillac executives acknowledged that the
technology could be expanded to other models. Cadillac has
historically led other GM divisions in the introduction of features
like air bags, anti-lock brakes and stability controls.

<P>
   Cadillac, with its rich tradition but lackluster recent past,
has been casting about for a new flagship to embody the brand's
attributes. Its designers have come up with a design concept for a
two-seat roadster, the Evoq, that will be shown to the public at
top-tier auto shows next year. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Evoq (pronounced ``evoke'') will be Cadillac's first concept
car in a decade, and ``is envisioned as a flagship model that
defines the soul of Cadillac,'' the General Motors division said in
releasing a sketch. Intended to evoke the power, emotion and
innovation of Cadillac's past, the Evoq suggests that GM may enter
the roadster market, where cars like the BMW Z3 and the Mercedes
SLK230 trade on retro themes.
</P>
<P>
   But Cadillac executives and designers stress that they are not
looking backward. ``This concept taps Cadillac's significant
heritage of design leadership without being at all retro,'' said
John F. Smith, Cadillac's general manager. ``We're interpreting in
a very modern way the attitude and flair of great Cadillacs from
the past. Its evocative design is a clear forerunner of future
Cadillacs.''
</P>
<P>
   Executives have spent much of the last several months
contemplating where GM's luxury division should head. They have
determined that future Cadillacs should fuse art and science _
combining distinctive styling with cutting-edge technology. High
style and advanced engineering were Cadillac hallmarks in the
division's glory days of the 1930s through the '60s.
</P>
<P>
   With its sharp edges and a look that almost seems
computer-generated, the Evoq indeed marks a bold design shift. The
wedge-shaped design includes vertical headlamps and taillights, a
Cadillac theme dating from the tail fins it originated in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   The rear-drive roadster is likely to be filled with high-tech
gadgets, including a three-piece retractable hardtop. It will be
equipped with the next generation of the Northstar V8 engine.

<P>
   &LR; In Saratoga Springs, N.Y., Victory Gallop and Coronado's Quest
are heading for a high-stakes rematch in the Travers on Saturday.
Here in California, fans of Kentucky Derby and Preakness winner
Real Quiet wonder which way to root.
</P>
<P>
   Real Quiet hasn't raced since his photo-finish loss to Victory
Gallop in the Belmont Stakes because of a hind-leg injury. He has
been jogging at Del Mar but isn't expected back in action until the
winter Santa Anita meeting. His absence has complicated the
campaign for the 3-year-old championship.
</P>
<P>
   Victory Gallop and Coronado's Quest, not necessarily in that
order, are the leading active 3-year-olds. If either goes
undefeated the rest of the season or beats his elders in the
Breeders' Cup Classic, he could expect to win the season-end
Eclipse Award vote by racing writers and executives.
</P>
<P>
   But if neither dominates, Real Quiet might yet win the
championship, even if some already consider his candidacy dead.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to the Travers, a $750,000, 1\-mile race at
Saratoga that is known as ``the summertime Derby'' and is likely to
be the last heavyweight event before 3-year-olds start facing older
horses. It's the favorites' second meeting, Coronado's Quest and
jockey Mike Smith having held off Victory Gallop and Gary Stevens
by 1\ lengths to win the Haskell Invitational Handicap at Monmouth
(N.J.) Park in the latter's only start since the Belmont.
</P>
<P>
   At least one of Victory Gallop's owners thinks the Travers will
be the pivotal race in the championship contest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if we win this race, we probably should be 3-year-old
champion,'' Art Preston said this week.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Janney, owner of Coronado's Quest, sees the Travers as a
little less decisive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I'd say it's pivotal,'' Janney said. ``I would
say that after what happened in the Haskell, we're a little bit
ahead. If Victory Gallop wins the Travers, maybe he's a little bit
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think whoever wins this race prances around and says
they're the 3-year-old champion. But it's a very important race.''
</P>
<P>
   Notice how neither mentions Real Quiet.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that reflects the general disrespect Real Quiet received
from the racing establishment _ which considered him ill-bred and
physically unimpressive _ even after he won the Derby and
Preakness.
</P>
<P>
   And maybe it shows how the importance of the springtime classics
to award voters has declined since the Breeders' Cup was
established in 1984 as kind of a championship playoff. Of the past
seven Kentucky Derby winners, only Thunder Gulch ('95) and Silver
Charm ('97) were voted 3-year-old champions.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, in the Eclipse Awards' 27 years, six horses
have won the Derby and Preakness only to be denied Triple Crowns in
the Belmont, and all six received the 3-year-old title: Canonero II
('71), Spectacular Bid ('79), Pleasant Colony ('81), Alysheba
('87), Sunday Silence ('89) and Silver Charm. Of course, most of
them won races later in the year.
</P>
<P>
   Real Quiet fans can also make these arguments:
</P>
<P>
   Against Victory Gallop: Hey, if he emerges as the leading
3-year-old of the late season, don't forget that he lost two of
three races against Real Quiet.
</P>
<P>
   Against Coronado's Quest: He's never faced Real Quiet, but
that's only because Coronado's Quest was held out of the Triple
Crown because of his persistent misbehavior in saddling paddocks
and post parades. Even if those turn out to have been caused by
panic attacks brought on by a breathing problem that has since been
corrected surgically, it's an invalid excuse for missing the
biggest 3-year-old races of all.
</P>
<P>
   Real Quiet's trainer, Bob Baffert, thinks it would be a shame if
his colt lost the age-group championship after ``he was a nose from
being Horse of the Year.'' Baffert assumes that if Real Quiet had
completed the first Triple Crown sweep in 20 years, he'd have been
guaranteed the Horse of the Year title, despite the heroics of
5-year-old Skip Away, who will try for his eighth straight victory
Sunday in the Iselin Handicap at Monmouth.
</P>
<P>
   Of Victory Gallop, Baffert said, ``I think he would have had to
win the Haskell and the Travers to beat him (Real Quiet) out.'' Of
Coronado's Quest, he said, ``You can't give it to a horse who
ducked the classics.''
</P>
<P>
   What Real Quiet fans should hope is that both are beaten by one
of the six other 3-year-olds in the Travers. Good luck. Behind
Victory Gallop (7-5 on the morning line as part of an entry with
rabbit Sheila's Flag) and Coronado's Quest (8-5), the best upset
chance belongs to Grand Slam (6-1), who was a solid third behind
the top two in the Haskell and has beaten neither.
</P>
<P>
   Victory Gallop won't have Stevens this time. California's top
stakes rider had surgery Tuesday to repair a meniscus tear in his
left knee and will miss two or three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Solis will be back on Victory Gallop. Together, they won
the Arkansas Derby and finished second in the Kentucky Derby.

TOMS RIVER EAST WINS U.S. LITTLE LEAGUE TITLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ED GUZMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILLIAMSPORT, Pa. _ They all made the pilgrimage here from Toms
River, N.J. Several hundred came by the busload and the carload,
having clearly caught the fever over their Little League team. One
devoted fan even came dressed in a monkey suit, holding up a sign
that read ``Unleash the Beast from the East.''
</P>
<P>
   These fans were not disappointed. Going through the pregame
tradition of tapping their lucky 2-foot tall gorilla, won in an
amusement park in Bristol, Conn., the Toms River East players
continued their charmed run with a 5-2 victory over Greenville,
N.C., in Thursday night's U.S. championship game in front of 28,300
at Howard J. Lamade Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Toms River had a three-run outburst in the first inning and then
held on for the second time in three days to win the U.S.
championship to stay undefeated in the series. Toms River will try
to continue its romp through Williamsport on Saturday afternoon
when it plays in the Little League World Series championship game
against Kashima, Japan, which won the international championship
earlier Thursday by 3-2 over Langley, Canada, in eight innings.
</P>
<P>
   For Toms River, shortstop Todd Frazier capped another brilliant
performance with a two-run home run over the center-field fence _
his third home run of the Series _ to give Toms River some
breathing room entering the sixth and final inning. Starting
pitcher Scott Fisher went the distance, allowing only four hits and
striking out 10. When first baseman Shelton Nelson's fly ball to
center field landed firmly in R.J. Johansen's glove for the final
out, the dream of a Little League World Series title was one step
closer to reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was awesome,'' Frazier said of the victory. ``It's like
we're the No. 1 team in the whole United States and it's a great
feeling to be that.''
</P>
<P>
   Frazier, who had scored seven of Toms River's 17 runs in this
World Series entering Thursday night, once again set the table for
his team's attack, drawing a walk on a full count to lead off the
game. Fisher followed with a towering fly ball to left that
Greenville left fielder J.D. Morgan was unable to handle, driving
in Frazier. Third baseman Gabe Gardner followed with his second
World Series home run, a majestic fly ball that landed well into
the grassy knoll beyond center field.
</P>
<P>
   Three batters into the game, and Toms River had a 3-0 lead. It
set the tone for the evening, much to the delight of the Toms River
crowd, which filled the night with chants of ``Let's go, East!''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was amazed after the first three games,'' said Toms River
manager Mike Gaynor. ``But after a week of competition, I felt
pretty confident heading into tonight's game. When we got up 3-0
early, it kind of took the wind out of the other team's sails.''
</P>
<P>
   Having won its first three games without starting its best
pitcher, Toms River finally started Fisher, a left-hander, Thursday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher, whose no-hitter in the East region championship game in
Bristol last week sent Toms River to the Little League World
Series, overcame some first-inning jitters and was masterful
against a power-hitting Greenville lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Greenville got a run back in the bottom of the first inning when
Brack Massey reached on a throwing error by Gardner.
</P>
<P>
   Massey made his way around the bases on a passed ball and two
wild pitches.
</P>
<P>
   After the first-inning, Greenville starting pitcher Alex White
let only one Toms River runner reach third base. White got some
great defensive help in the second inning, as right fielder Mike
Lilley made a diving grab of a Frazier line drive that was slicing
toward the line. The following inning, Fisher was denied a base hit
when third baseman Brandon Brown made a difficult over-the-shoulder
catch of Fisher's pop-up.
</P>
<P>
   Greenville again cut into the lead when shortstop Justin Hardee
crushed a pitch over the right-field fence for a solo home run. But
Toms River put on some nifty defense of its own, as second baseman
Joey Franceschini went up the middle to rob Massey of a hit.
</P>
<P>
   A scary moment occurred in the top of the fourth inning when
right fielder Eric Campesi led off the inning with a dribbler back
to the mound. White threw the ball away, but Campesi ran right into
first baseman Shelton Nelson's outstretched forearm.
</P>
<P>
   Campesi was down for several minutes, but eventually walked off
the field.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher brought the same determination to the mound, striking out
nine through the first five innings and retiring 13 of the next 16
batters he faced after allowing the first run to score.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher brought the delirious Toms River crowd to its feet when
he struck out the side in the fifth inning, capping off the inning
by getting Hardee swinging.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just one of the greatest pitchers,'' Frazier said. ``He's
awesome. I feel really confident when he's on the mound.''
</P>
<P>
   Frazier then commented on Saturday's game: ``I just want to go
out and have fun. Even if we lose, we're still the No. 1 team in
the U.S.''
</P>
<P>
   Gaynor added, jokingly, ``We're not going to lose, Todd.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, with Toms River on such a roll, he may only have
been half-joking.

 MOSCOW: President Clinton.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In an unusual move that spoke volumes about Yeltsin's diminished
authority, it was Yastrzhembsky who went to the parliament on
Thursday and spent three hours in conference with the chief of
Russia's Communist Party, Gennadi Zyuganov. The focus of their
discussions was a draft document which demands that the president
cede his considerable powers to appoint and fire governments and
sign economic decrees, and yield them to the parliament, or Duma,
now dominated by the Communist Party-led opposition.
</P>
<P>
   In return, the document would commit the Duma to support
Chernomyrdin as prime minister, stop impeachment proceedings
against Yeltsin, impose a moratorium on no confidence votes against
the government and pass a law on ``social guarantees'' for the
president.
</P>
<P>
   The political document _ devised as an informal treaty between
the Kremlin, the Duma and the Russian government _ would circumvent
the Russian constitution, forcing Yeltsin to become little more
than a ceremonial head of state, with powers similar to Britain's
Queen Elizabeth.
</P>
<P>
   According to a well-informed Russian journalist, Yastrzhembsky
told Zyuganov on Thursday that the president will refuse to sign
the document. Zyuganov, in turn, said that without the president's
signature, the parliament will not confirm Chernomyrdin as prime
minister at a session now scheduled for next week.
</P>
<P>
   In public comments after the meeting, Yastrzhembsky said only
that the political document, and the separate draft program for a
radical change in the country's economic course, ``constitute a
basis for compromise.'' Zyuganov hinted that negotiations are not
over.
</P>
<P>
   ``The presidential camp is now aware of what is happening in the
country and now that they understand reality, consultations may
become more productive,'' he said, noting in other comments that
the president's future ``social welfare'' was also discussed.
</P>
<P>
   According to Sergei Markov, director of the Institute of
Political Studies, Yeltsin's resignation before his term expires in
2000 is `'definitely under discussion, but the issue is when, and
with what mechanism.'' Markov said Yeltsin's primary concern will
be a guarantee that he and his family will be immune from any
future prosecution, which could arise on a list of charges,
including treason, included in articles of impeachment now being
discussed in the Duma.
</P>
<P>
   `'But,'' said Markov,''Boris Yeltsin can only resign if he sees
that Mr. Chernomyrdin controls the situation.'' Markov and other
political analysts say pressure on Yeltsin to resign is probably
coming from advisers who want to see Chernomyrdin _ whom Yeltsin
has already anointed as his successor _ run for president in early
elections, before he is too badly tarnished by the economic crisis.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But other analysts cautioned that most resignation scenarios now
spinning wildly on Moscow's rumor mill lack any hard information
about Yeltsin's own intentions. `'We don't know what the president
thinks about it,'' said Vyacheslav Nikonov, director of the
Politica Foundation. `'There is alot of talk about this
resignation, but no one is sure if he is well informed about it.''
</P>
<P>
   `'Everything is up to Yeltsin,''said Pavel Voshchanov, a
journalist who was the Russian president's press spokesman during
the 1991 coup. `'The situation in the Kremlin is in complete
disarray, almost everyone has left him. He is in a dead end.''
</P>
<P>
   Grigory Yavlinsky, who heads a party that has opposed Yeltsin's
policies but supports economic reform, said in a radio interview
that Yeltsin has to come forward with an explanation for his
decision to rename Chernomyrdin as prime minister, five months
after he fired him. `'If the Chernomyrdin appointment implies early
elections, let us hear this,'' said Yavlinsky in an Echo Moskvy
broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   Most observers agree that Chernomyrdin, faced with a fast
deteriorating economic situation, is ready to compromise with the
parliament, and its Communist-dominated majority, and even accept
its draft economic program. He is also expected to agree on naming
several Communists to his cabinet, although both sides may agree
that their ministerial portfolios should be limited to second-tier
positions, such as agriculture or culture.
</P>
<P>
   `'What Mr. Chernomyrdin needs most is early approval by the
Duma,'' said Nikonov, `'which is why he will sacrifice many things.
He also wants to spread responsibility as widely as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The draft document, now headed for discussion, would reverse a
seven-year- long economic reform program which has been based on
mass privatization and tight monetary policies. Instead, it calls
for increased government management of the economy, protection of
the banking system and support for Russian industry _ policies that
would necessarily require a mass infusion of rubles.
</P>
<P>
   In presenting the program on Thursday, the parliament's deputy
speaker, Vladimir Ryzhkov, parliamentary leader of Chernomyrdin's
party, Our Home is Russia, agreed that the program would require
money, ``but not a Niagara Falls of worthless rubles that will
inundate the economy and spur hyper-inflation.'' He described the
program as a compromise document, with proposals advanced by the
leftist opposition that is `'quite civilized and reasonable, not
extremist at all.''

RAFTER CONTINUES TO BLAZE THROUGH U.S. OPEN TUNEUP 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By RON DICKER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   COMMACK, N.Y. _ For Patrick Rafter, it was women's day at the
Hamlet Cup. Rafter, the dashing Australian who is seeded second,
gave his fans something to swoon over Thursday afternoon when he
signed autographs, kissed a woman celebrating her 40th birthday and
charmed his way through a question-and-answer session with more
than 400 women. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Thursday ight, he gave them something to cheer. Rafter made
quick work of Martin Damm of the Czech Republic, 6-4, 6-3, to reach
the quarterfinals. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very relaxed and serving well,'' he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rafter, the defending U.S. Open champion, has won 23 of his last
25 matches. He will take on Nicolas Escude of France on Friday.
Escude disposed of Hicham Arazi of Morocco, 6-3, 3-6, 6-3. Arazi
will be Rafter's first-round opponent in the United States Open
next week.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if it was crucial to play well in the Open tuneup, Rafter
said: ``It's important to feel good and to hit the ball well. The
results here are not quite as significant. I don't need to win here
to repeat.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gustavo Kuerten of Brazil fought off stifling afternoon humidity
and four match points in the tie breaker to defeat Francisco Clavet
of Spain, 2-6, 6-3, 7-6 (10-8). In the quarterfinals, Kuerten will
face eighth-seeded Felix Mantilla of Spain, a 7-6 (7-4), 6-3 winner
over Bohdan Ulihrach of the Czech Republic, in another
quarterfinal. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it would be too difficult to come back,'' Kuerten
said, ``but when I got to within a point I just thought I would
make him play my ball.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kuerten fell behind, 6-3, in the tie breaker before he went into
one of the shot-making flurries that characterize his play as much
as his inconsistency. He slammed a service winner, ripped a topspin
forehand winner and then evened the tie breaker with a drop shot
that died on contact with the asphalt. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At 8-8, Kuerten tapped another drop shot that Clavet returned,
but Kuerten's reflex volley landed for a winner to make it 9-8. He
then served an ace to finish the 1-hour-50-minute match. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I could play a little more intelligently,'' said Kuerten, who
won the 1997 French Open but has just one tour victory since. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Because of his recent lack of success, the No. 27-ranked Kuerten
enters next week's Open without the fanfare of 1997. ``Maybe when I
go up in the rankings, I push myself too hard,'' he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Friday's other Hamlet quarterfinals, David Prinosil of
Germany will meet Marat Safin of Russia and Daniel Vacek of the
Czech Republic will play fourth-seeded Greg Rusedski of England.

IRAN ORDERED TO PAY DAMAGES TO HOSTAGES 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A federal judge has awarded $65 million in damages
to three Americans who sued the Iranian government for its part in
kidnapping the three men in Lebanon in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson of U.S. District Court reportedly
found that the former hostages _ Joseph Cicippio, Frank Reed and
David Jacobsen _ were the victims of terrorism under a federal law
passed two years ago that allows such victims to pursue civil suits
in American courts against some foreign governments.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Iran will ever pay any of the damages is doubtful. It
did not take part in the legal proceedings, according to The
Washington Post, which first reported the judge's ruling in its
Friday editions.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson awarded $20 million to Cicippio, $16 million to Reed and
$9 million to Jacobsen, The Post reported. He awarded $10 million
each to the wives of Cicippio and Reed.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs had argued that the Iranian government controlled
the Hezbollah extremists who carried out the kidnappings.

COWBOYS SHOW JAGS VERY LITTLE IN LOPSIDED LOSS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. _ It's a good thing avoiding a winless
preseason wasn't a priority for the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   That attitude probably made the 42-20 gangster-slapping by the
Jacksonville Jaguars Thursday night before 71,526 fans at Alltell
Stadium and a national television audience in CBS' first broadcast
of the Cowboys in four years a little easier to take.
</P>
<P>
   Turnovers, poor tackling and host of mistakes by the Cowboys
reserves saw a 21-17 deficit in the third quarter erode into an
embarrassment, securing the first winless preseason for the Cowboys
(0-5) since 1986. The only other winless preseason came in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   Considering that the ho-hum results against Jacksonville
reflected the entire preseason for the Cowboys, there is a question
of what the Cowboys will actually look like in the regular-season
opener. They play the Arizona Cardinals Sept. 6, trying to end a
five-game losing streak that carries from last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would have hoped that the end result would have been
better,'' Cowboys coach Chan Gailey said. ``But that's over and
done with, and it's time to get to the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got work to do. But getting ready for the real thing was
our goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Though winning would have been nice, the Cowboys' main
intentions coming into the game were:
</P>
<P>
   To evaluate bubble players before Sunday's final roster cutdown
to 53 players.
</P>
<P>
   Get a look at backup quarterback Jason Garrett with the
first-team offensive line.
</P>
<P>
   Continue some of the momentum the first-team offense gained in
last week's outing against the St. Louis Rams.
</P>
<P>
   And try to find a kickoff returner.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe two out of four will do for Gailey, who saw some good
things out of rookie free-agent receiver Jeff Ogden, who might have
earned a roster spot with a solid performance, and Garrett, who led
the Cowboys to two scoring drives.
</P>
<P>
   However, while Troy Aikman and the first-team offense didn't
revert back to the struggling form they showed in preseason losses
to Oakland and New England, they displayed nowhere near the
crispness of the performance against the Rams.
</P>
<P>
   Playing just the first quarter, the Cowboys managed just 33
total yards and two first downs, compared to 161 and eight for the
Jaguars. On Saturday, the Cowboys outgained the lowly Rams 258-108
in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   The Jaguars, picked by many as Super Bowl contenders, held
running back Emmitt Smith to 3 yards on three attempts. He rushed
for 110 yards against the Rams in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the question of whether to re-sign kickoff returner
Herschel Walker remains unanswered. Receiver Stepfret Williams got
all the return opportunities against the Jaguars, offering an
uneven performance. Williams had a 51-yard return in the first
quarter, however, he showed hesitancy on a couple of other returns
and bottomed out with a fumble on a return in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys had four second-half turnovers, including two
fumbles and two interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Superlatives for the Jaguars included a team rushing total of
176 yards on 37 carries for an average of 4.8 yards per attempt,
Mark Brunell completing eight of 12 passes for 148 yards and two
touchdowns, and Jimmy Smith hauling in three passes for 94 yards
and two touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought at times we showed some things that were decent, but
obviously not nearly enough things,'' Gailey said. ``We were
sporadic offensively and missed too many tackles amd gave away too
many rushing yards on defense. You would have hoped we could have
done a little bit more. But we got a lot accomplished in the
preseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are we where we want to be? No. Can we get there? Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Aikman, who completed just two of four passes for 27 yards, said
he thinks the Cowboys will come out with a good performance against
the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are areas of concern,'' Aikman said. ``But the preseason
is over and will have no more excuses against Arizona.''
</P>
<P>
   At the outset, it looked like this might be the breakthrough
game for the Cowboys. Three plays after kickoff, the Cowboys
defense, maligned last season for its inability to create
turnovers, did just that.
</P>
<P>
   Starting free-safety candidate George Teague, playing in the
nickel defense, flashed in front of Jacksonville receiver Keenan
McCardell to deflect a pass from Brunell. The ball bounced into the
hands of speedy weakside linebacker Dexter Coakley, who returned
the ball 22 yards for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   The momentum, however, was shortlived, as the Jaguars promptly
answered with an 80-yard touchdown drive. Former Cowboys receiver
Smith blew past cornerback Kevin Mathis, who started in place of
injured cornerback Deion Sanders, for a 45-yard touchdown
reception.
</P>
<P>
   The Jaguars made the score 14-7 and really never looked back,
despite a brief Cowboys rally led by Garrett.

   NEW HAVEN, Conn. _ Not many players have beaten Steffi Graf
three times in one year. But Amanda Coetzer of South Africa is one
of them, having defeated her in three of their four meetings last
year, with two of those victories coming in Grand Slam events, the
Australian Open and French Open.
</P>
<P>
   But that was before the 29-year-old Graf _ the dominant women's
player of the late 1980s and most of the '90s _ underwent knee
surgery last June. Thursday night, playing in only her ninth
tournament since returning to competition, Graf found herself
matched against the 27-year-old Coetzer again in the quarterfinals
of the inaugural Pilot Pen International Women's Tennis
Championships.
</P>
<P>
   For Graf, the winner of 21 Grand Slam tournaments, but none in
the last two years, it was payback time against the tenacious,
never-give-up 5-foot-2-inch Coetzer, who finished last year ranked
third in the world but has slipped to 12th in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   After falling behind, 3-2, when Coetzer broke her service in the
fifth game of the opening set, Graf put on a vintage performance,
winning the last 10 games of the match to prevail, 6-3, 6-0, and
advance to Friday's semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   Graf's semifinal opponent will be top-seeded Lindsay Davenport,
who downed unseeded Anke Huber, 6-3, 6-3, in Thursday night's
second match. Graf holds a 5-3 edge over the 22-year-old Davenport.
But the 6-foot 2-inch Californian _ who has captured her last three
tournaments, and five over all this year, and risen to second in
the world ranking _ has won three of their last four matches.
</P>
<P>
   Second-seeded Jana Novotna, the reigning Wimbledon champion,
advanced to the semifinals with a 6-1, 7-6 (7-4) victory over
19-year-old Amelie Mauresmo of France, who is ranked 32d, during
the day session. Novotna will meet another relatively unknown
unseeded player from France, Julie Halard-Decugis, in Friday's
semifinal at 5 p.m. Halard-Decugis, 27, who is ranked 31st, beat
Mary Jo Fernandez, 7-5, 6-1.
</P>
<P>
   If it was not Graf at her best, it was close, as the German
overwhelmed Coetzer during those last 10 games with her serve,
powerful forehand and laserlike backhand. Helpless under the
onslaught, Coetzer, normally able to run just about everything down
_ as she did in a dramatic comeback victory over 17-year-old Anna
Kournikova on Wednesday _ lost her composure.
</P>
<P>
   Graf, whose best finishes this year have been as a semifinal
loser in three tournaments _ twice to Davenport _ was gracious in
victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't make many mistakes, and maybe she made more than
usual,'' said Graf, who yielded only 5 points in her last five
service games and only 2 in the second set. ``She didn't play her
best and in the second set didn't have a game plan and seemed to
lose control of what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Graf had a lot to do with that loss of control, as she played
nearly flawlessly, moving well and showing no signs of having
slowed down following her long recuperation from knee surgery that
kept her on the sidelines for eight months.
</P>
<P>
   ``My backhand worked very well,'' she said, ``and as the match
went on, I started to hit deeper and I didn't have any letdown.''
</P>
<P>
   Graf said that she was not trying to exact revenge for the three
losses at Coetzer's hands last year. But she did say, ``It made me
more focused than anything.''

   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
PHOENIX _ It wasn't pretty, but it sure was fun.
</P>
<P>
   Except for a couple of minor details.
</P>
<P>
   The team coached by the lady with the big mouth won. And the
player once coached by the Houston coach hit the shot that beat her
old coach _ 54-51 _ in the opening game of the best-of-three WNBA
finals.
</P>
<P>
   Boy, some kind of gratitude
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I hadn't coached her so well,'' Van Chancellor said of
one-time Ole Miss and current Phoenix star Jennifer Gillom, whose
post-up bucket with nine seconds left Thursday gave the
high-and-mighty Comets their first truly gagging dose of adversity
all season long.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love Jennifer,'' Chancellor said. ``But I love us more.''
</P>
<P>
   At Comets practice today, however, it's going to be tough love.
Chancellor didn't care for much of what he saw this night. While he
loathes the format that put the Comets in their predicament _ how
do you go 27-3 and wind up starting the WNBA Championship Series on
the road in a nut house like America West Arena? _ he decided not
to make excuses.
</P>
<P>
   He leveled the blame where it belonged _ on his players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have liked to have seen us show a lot more patience
with the basketball,'' Chancellor said. ``We're going to talk about
it a bunch, you can bet on that.''
</P>
<P>
   And he would have preferred that, patience or no patience, they
shoot with a modicum of accuracy and rebound with a tad more
tenacity.
</P>
<P>
   The Comets proved they are a great team because they shouldn't
have been anywhere close to winning at the end, yet they weren't
flat-out beaten until a pull-up 12-footer by Sheryl Swoopes decided
to literally jump back out of the basket after it was down inside.
</P>
<P>
   Not much help for Cooper
</P>
<P>
   Swoopes nearly threw the ball away on the inbounds pass, but
Tina Thompson made a gutsy save and Swoopes, suffering through a
dreadful offensive performance, wound up with a clean look at the
hoop.
</P>
<P>
   Her redemption was at hand.
</P>
<P>
   Clank.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, Cynthia Cooper's 40-foot hook shot off the right
side of rim in the last second was the miss that put the Comets
into their sudden sudden-death mode, but I'm not going to pick on
Madam Coop, believe me.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper tried to win it by herself, scoring 29 of Houston's 51
points while hitting 11 of the Comets' paltry 21 field goals. Her
11-for-24 compared rather favorably to the 8-for-38 the other
starters managed. That included a 3-for-14 effort by Swoopes and
poor Kim Perrot's 1-for-12.
</P>
<P>
   Factor in the Mercury's plus-nine rebounding bulge, and
Chancellor was exactly right: The Comets had no business hanging
around until the end. They put up 25 fewer points than their
regular-season norm.
</P>
<P>
   Especially galling for the frustrated visitors was the memory of
Miller, after an earlier loss to the Comets here, going before the
crowd and basically promising the Mercury would have the last
laugh.
</P>
<P>
   And way back in the preseason, Miller had told the locals the
Mercury was going to ``bring this bad boy home.'' How ``bad boy''
came to mean ``championship'' escapes me, but I suppose, whatever
the vernacular, it ain't bragging if you do it.
</P>
<P>
   If. I wouldn't count the Comets out just yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to win two home games,'' Chancellor said. ``It's as
simple as that.''
</P>
<P>
   And one loss would double their season total at Compaq Center.
</P>
<P>
   Turbo's time has come
</P>
<P>
   By the way, memo to you Comets crazies: You owe the Mercury the
same kind of roof-raising racket Saturday that your heroines were
subjected to here in the desert.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix pulled out all the stops. Even the Gorilla, the Suns'
eternal, infernal mascot, dropped by for a visit. After one
trampoline dunk, he pulled himself up onto the rim and stood there,
waving a giant Mercury flag while the 13,634 customers went utterly
berserk.
</P>
<P>
   And the referees actually let him do it, although during the
same timeout Miller was assessed a technical foul.
</P>
<P>
   This is war, Les. Turbo had better be on the premises Saturday.
And Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, the Comets had better bring a bench. Miller got
66 minutes from five Phoenix reserves whereas Chancellor played
only Janeth Arcain and Yolanda Moore for a combined 27. The Comets'
dismal shooting and poor boxing out were no doubt fatigue-related.
</P>
<P>
   Swoopes and Cooper, who missed five of her last seven shots,
each played 39 minutes on ouchy knees, and Perrot was on the court
for 38 with her aching ankle. No Phoenix player went more than 34
minutes. And the Mercury, with far fresher legs, still shot only 35
percent. Gillom was 4-for-19 herself until The Bucket.
</P>
<P>
   ``I should have done a better job of telling my team, `Don't let
Jennifer beat us,''' Chancellor said. ``We should have forced her
to kick the ball out.''
</P>
<P>
   At least another opportunity beckons. It's
put-up-to-shut-up-Miller time.

COWBOYS MIGHT BE RECEPTIVE TO JAGS' WILLIE JACKSON
</HEADLINE>
 NOTES-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. AND KEVIN LYONS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. _ If the Dallas Cowboys are in the market for
a receiver, Willie Jackson of the Jaguars might be available on
Sunday's final cutdown day.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, who was cut by the Cowboys as a rookie before
resurrecting his career in Jacksonville, is on the bubble. Rookie
Alvis Whitted has passed him as the No. 3 receiver with the
Jaguars, and receiver Reggie Barlow is expected to be their kick
returner. The Jaguars must decide how prudent it is to keep Jackson
and his veteran salary as a No. 4 or No. 5 receiver.
</P>
<P>
   Outside of Michael Irvin and Ernie Mills, Jackson offers the
Cowboys more experience than any of their receivers.
</P>
<P>
   Lacking quality receivers, the Cowboys used tight end Eric
Bjornson in the four-receiver set at times Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   _ Clarence E. Hill Jr. ZEBBIE IN NICKEL
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys gave former Texas Tech quarterback Zebbie Lethridge,
who is trying to make the transition to cornerback, a long look
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Lethridge played in the first-team nickel defense against the
Jaguars and replaced starter Kevin Smith at left cornerback in the
second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Jaguars quarterback Mark Brunell showed no mercy on the former
signal caller, burning him deep for a 31-yard touchdown pass to
Jimmy Smith. The Cowboys are trying to decide if Lethridge is worth
a roster spot or if he is a practice-squad candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Brunell and Smith weren't picking on Lethridge, they gave the
same treatment to cornerback Kevin Mathis, burning him deep for a
45-yard touchdown pass in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   _ Clarence E. Hill Jr. DAVIS STARTS AGAIN
</P>
<P>
   After starting ahead of Mills for the third consecutive game,
Billy Davis looks like he has won the battle at No. 2 receiver.
</P>
<P>
   Davis did not catch a pass Thursday night, but finished the
preseason with seven catches for 57 yards and a touchdown. Mills
caught one pass for 14 yards Thursday night, giving him three
catches for 27 yards in the preseason.
</P>
<P>
   _ Clarence E. Hill Jr. CUTDOWN FODDER
</P>
<P>
   The hardest decision the Cowboys might have to make concerning
cutdowns will be at wide receiver. Because of the receiving ability
of backup tight end Bjornson, coach Chan Gailey has indicated he
could conceivably keep five wide receivers on his roster.
</P>
<P>
   With that, the axe could fall on either Macey Brooks or Jeff
Ogden.
</P>
<P>
   Both had two receptions Thursday night. But Ogden had 61 yards
receiving to Brooks' 18. And Ogden turned in one of the night's
highlights with a one-handed, 39-yard reception from Jason Garrett
that set up a third quarter touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   _ Kevin Lyons TEAGUE MAKES CASE
</P>
<P>
   Omar Stoutmire got the start again at free safety for the fourth
time in the five preseason games. However, veteran George Teague
made a strong case for the position with a first-quarter pass
deflection that linebacker Dexter Coakley intercepted and returned
22 yards for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   The play was indicative of what Teague, who has been known as a
gambler throughout his six-year career and has a knack for making
big plays, can offer the Cowboys. Stoutmire, however, was solid in
run support. He recorded three tackles in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   _ Clarence E. Hill Jr. BRIEFLY
</P>
<P>
   _ Team owner Jerry Jones said the club is checking into whether
to sign linebacker Jim Schwantz, whom the 49ers released several
days ago.
</P>
<P>
   _ Linebacker James Bates (sprained left ankle), running back
Chris Warren (strained left groin), and cornerback Lethridge (left
hand contusion) were listed on the Cowboys' postgame injury report.
</P>

COWBOYS' GARRETT SHINES IN BACKUP ROLE
</HEADLINE>
 SIDER-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN LYONS c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. _ One of the top priorities for the Dallas
Cowboys on Thursday night was to see what they have in backup
quarterback Jason Garrett.
</P>
<P>
   Playing behind second- and third-team offensive linemen much of
the summer, Garrett had struggled mightily before playing the
Jacksonville Jaguars. He had been sacked five times, thrown a pass
that was intercepted and returned for a touchdown, and had a
team-low 54.9 rating in passing efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm interested in seeing how Jason Garrett operates with most
of the first team,'' team owner Jerry Jones said as he stood on the
sidelines before the Cowboys' 42-20 loss to the Jaguars. ``We want
to give him the protection and the blocking. We want to have a good
feel at that spot. It's not an issue of whether or not we're
looking to bring in someone as a backup quarterback. That's not an
issue. We just want him to get that work to have confidence, so we
can be confident too.''
</P>
<P>
   Like most teams, the Cowboys will not have much of a chance to
compete if starting quarterback Troy Aikman misses time because of
an injury. But Garrett did nothing to hurt the club's confidence in
him Thursday night. Finally, with time to throw, he led the Cowboys
to 10 points. He was 7-for-9 passing for 87 yards. More important,
he had no interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been playing with different combinations of guys, and
people get caught up in statistics too much sometimes,'' Garrett
said. ``Everybody understands that in the preseason you are going
to try different things. But my approach has always been the same,
to try to make plays when I have the opportunity. Tonight, I had
some nice opportunities and the guys around me made plays some nice
plays also.''
</P>
<P>
   Garrett opened the third quarter by leading an eight-play,
81-yard drive. It was Garrett's first touchdown drive of the
preseason and came with the second-team offensive line. Garrett
displayed his strength on the first play of the series, lofting a
perfect, deep spiral to free-agent Jeff Ogden, who beat man-to-man
coverage to make a one-handed grab.
</P>
<P>
   It was, coach Chan Gailey said, ``a great throw.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And that wasn't all,'' Gailey said. ``He showed nice execution
the way he drove us down the field. You try to work Troy in with
the first unit for continuity, then you get to the last game and
you try to work on getting Jason some reps with the first team. He
helped himself, and he helped us.''

RUBLE WOES FELT WIDELY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DEBORAH ADAMSON  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- First Asia, now Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The notion that America's economic welfare is tied to nations
around the world was sharply brought into focus when the U.S. stock
markets plunged in reaction to the worsening economic crisis half a
world away.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average Thursday dropped 357.36 points,
or 4.2 percent, to 8,165.99, the biggest one-day point loss since
Oct. 27. The Dow was last in 8,100 territory in February. The
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 Index dropped 3.8 percent, or 41.68, to
1,042.51. The Nasdaq Composite Index dived 81.72, or 4.6 percent,
to 1,686.41.
</P>
<P>
   The repercussions of Russia's financial woes have been heard all
over the globe:
</P>
<P>
   --In Germany, Japan and the United States, where major banks
have lent money to Russia that now may not be repaid.
</P>
<P>
   --In China and Hong Kong, where the probability of devaluation
there looms closer.
</P>
<P>
   --In Mexico and the rest of Latin America, where their status as
emerging markets makes them a nervous investment for investors
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   --And, finally, in the investment portfolios and pension savings
of millions of Americans, which have wilted under the heat of the
global commotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia is a systematic problem that will not be going away. It
will be there for years,'' said Don Wellenreiter, president of
Defined Risk Asset Management Inc., a commodity trading advisory
firm in Newbury Park. ``The ripple effect is starting to hit the
world markets and it will be around for quite a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Economists say this ripple actually started nine years ago, when
the Berlin Wall fell. Countries that were run by communists less
than a decade ago are now learning the nuances of market-driven
economies and, in Russia at least, having a hard time with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (Russian) government doesn't have a clue,'' said Michael
Bernstam, an expert on the Russian economy at the Hoover
Institution think tank of Stanford University. ``This is a house of
cards and any wind could blow it down.''
</P>
<P>
   Bernstam said Russia is beset by problems: It is having trouble
switching from an economy controlled by the government to a
market-driven economy, similar to the one in the United States; its
major industries continue to rely on government subsidies; private
citizens and companies that control Russia's natural resources are
not paying their taxes in part because of government inefficiency
at collection; and it relies on foreign money for even basic
expenses like wages.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign money that has poured into Russia comes from many
sources, and includes the investments of U.S. mutual, hedge and
pension funds as well as loans from German, U.S. and Japanese
bankers.
</P>
<P>
   But last fall's economic crisis in Asia affected Russia's
ability to attract foreign funds. The Asian nations that had their
own currency crises last fall increased their interest rates to
help prop up the value of their money. That meant that the rates
they would pay on bonds or loans rose as well. Russia, in turn, had
to raise its rates to compete for the world's investors.
</P>
<P>
   As interest rates rose, bond prices declined. Unfortunately,
many Russian banks had used the country's bonds as collateral for
their borrowings. When bond prices dropped, so did the value of
their collateral, Bernstam said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, international lenders made what are known as margin
calls. That is, they told Russian bankers to put up more collateral
or repay the loan. Russian banks defaulted.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't help that as the Asian crisis hit, world oil prices
weakened. Russia relies heavily on oil exports to bring more money
into the country. Less income from oil has made it difficult for
Russia to pay for imports like food.
</P>
<P>
   The International Monetary Fund and World Bank -- a coalition of
countries that assist financially troubled nations -- led a group
of institutional lenders that offered a $22 billion relief package
to Russia, an IMF spokesman said. About $4.8 billion was disbursed
immediately to Russia but it was depleted quickly, used to repay
some loans, pay the people's back wages and defend the ruble.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 17, the Russian government defaulted on its bonds and
allowed its currency -- the ruble -- to be devalued. That means it
takes more rubles to exchange for one U.S. dollar than it did last
month, increasing the cost of imported goods for Russians.
</P>
<P>
   The devaluation triggered a round of global jitters that
culminated with Thursday's sell-off on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   With the value of the ruble weakening, people exchanged their
money for U.S. dollars, a stable currency. With greater demand, the
value of the dollar rose. But in doing so, it made other nations'
currencies weaker in comparison.
</P>
<P>
   Countries that don't want their currency devalued will be forced
to defend it by raising their U.S. dollar reserves, if they can
afford it, Bernstam said.
</P>
<P>
   If not, they will be pressured to raise interest rates to shrink
the money supply and boost the currency's value. Higher rates make
it more difficult for businesses to grow by borrowing, so the
economy of a nation that raises rates could slow down.

VALDES PLEASED WITH SEVEN-INNING OUTING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS COCOLES  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN BERNARDINO, Calif. _ The blisters on his right hand that
stalled Ismael Valdes' road back to Dodger Stadium resurfaced in
perhaps his final rehabilitation start.
</P>
<P>
   The wounds opened up again, but unlike Saturday in Vero Beach,
Fla., when Los Angelesdodgers pitcher Valdes was limited to 31/3
innings, he wasn't about to pack it in Thursday at San Bernardino
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to go,'' Valdes said. ``(The Stampede coaching staff)
wanted me to stop.''
</P>
<P>
   His second rehab start since landing on the disabled list in
late July with a strained abdominal muscle, this one coming for the
Single-A San Bernardino Stampede against the JetHawks Thursday
night, wasn't anything spectacular when analyzing the numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The JetHawks managed seven hits and scratched out two runs off
the 25-year-old right-hander in 61/3 innings. But he achieved his
goals, throwing 92 pitches, 68 for strikes. He finished with four
strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an excellent experience for me. It's what I needed,''
Valdes said. ``The best thing for me was I went into the seventh
inning.''
</P>
<P>
   Valdes came out throwing strikes _ seven in a row to begin the
game. He jumped ahead in the count to the first six hitters he
faced, retiring all of them on just 21 pitches.
</P>
<P>
   In the third, when his blister acted up again, Valdes yielded a
bloop single to Karl Thompson when the ball was misjudged in right
field. Anton French followed with a clean base hit to right and
Joel Ramirez's blooper that dropped just inside of the right-field
line produced a run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't snap the slider and breaking ball. But the fastball
and changeup was pretty good,'' said Valdes, who hopes to return to
the big club by Tuesday and pitch again late next week.
</P>
<P>
   He experieneced no discomfort in his abdominal area, the reason
he was put on the disabled list. He even tested it, making a diving
stab of Joel Ramirez's would-be base hit back up the middle. On his
belly, Valdes flipped the ball over to first for the out.
</P>
<P>
   It's probably not something Dodgers manager Glenn Hoffman,

Valdes wasn't concerned.

BEAR MARKET FINDS HOME AS BROAD INDEXES BACK
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- For several broad indexes of the U.S. stock
markets, 4 percent drop of the Dow Jones industrial average was a
case of been-there-done-that.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the Dow has lost just over 12 percent of its value since
peaking in late July. And the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500, another widely
cited market index, has roughly mirrored the Dow, off 12.55 percent
in the same period.
</P>
<P>
   But step back and the carnage from recent sell-offs is far more
apparent and widespread.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under most circumstances, the S&AMP;P 500 is a fair indicator of
the overall market,'' said James Gipson, manager of the $973
million Clipper Fund based in Beverly Hills. ``So far this year,
that has not been the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Take, for example, what's happening in the small-capitalization
arena.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000, which tracks 2,000 small-cap companies with an
average market capitalization of $400 million, is in full-bear
mode, having lost more than 25 percent of its value since peaking
as far back as April. By definition, a market or index is
considered to be a ``bear'' if it is off at least 20 percent from
its peak.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investors around the world have been getting much more
risk-averse,'' said Tamoko Iwakawa, a vice president and
foreign-exchange adviser at Union Bank of California. Money has
been flowing away from stocks in general and toward safer
securities such as bonds, Iwakawa said. That phenomenon only has
been magnified for smaller firms.
</P>
<P>
   If history is any judge, it could take a year or more for the
small-cap companies suffering this year to regain the lost ground.
In its 1987 and 1990 bear markets, the Russell 2000 index took 11
months and 24 months respectively to reach its previous highs.
</P>
<P>
   But some believe the current bear in the small-cap arena could
live longer than its predecessors. Even with the corrections,
``valuations today are the highest in the history of man,'' Gipson
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got some of the lowest dividend yields and highest
(price to earning) ratios ever. The fact that a stock is down
doesn't mean it's cheap. It just means somebody lost money holding
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Other major indexes have fallen past the ``correction'' standard
of 10 percent and are heading toward ``bear'' territory as well.
</P>
<P>
   The NYSE composite, made up of the 3,000 or so companies traded
on the New York Stock Exchange, has fallen nearly 14 percent since
July.
</P>
<P>
   The even broader Nasdaq composite index, which includes the
5,215 companies traded on the Nasdaq stock exchange, has lost more
than 16 percent of its value since July. Heavily weighted toward
technology issues, the Nasdaq has borne the brunt of the Asian
currency crisis in the United States, with its members finding it
hard to sell computers, electronic components and specialized
software to countries like Indonesia, Korea and Thailand.

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Half of Phoenix coach Cheryl Miller's guarantee is in
the bag.
</P>
<P>
   With the Comets shooting terribly all game, Miller's Mercury
rode a strong first-half performance from center Jennifer Gillom to
deck the defending champions 54-51 in the first game of the 1998
WNBA Championship Series on Thursday night at America West Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like they said in The Wizard of Oz, there's no place like
home,'' Miller told the crowd once the Mercury had taken a 1-0 lead
in the best-of-three series, which resumes at Compaq Center at 3
p.m. Saturday for Game 2. ``We've been getting a little bit of heat
lately because of some brash statements made by the head coach. If
you don't believe in this team, in this city, in this franchise, I
tell you, it's on.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a similar postgame speech to one she delivered in July
when the Comets had beaten the Mercury 65-62 at America West,
sending Phoenix on a skid that resulted in seven losses in nine
games. Then, the Basketball Hall of Famer promised the teams would
meet in the WNBA finals and that the Mercury would ``win that bad
boy.''
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix now has the upper hand largely because of Gillom's
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jennifer is a great player just like Cooper (the Comets'
Cynthia Cooper) is a great player, and they make plays down the
stretch,'' Miller said. ``She was able to do that, and we made sure
on our last play that we would get the ball to Jennifer.''
</P>
<P>
   After a timeout and with the score tied at 51, Gillom took a
pass from Michele Timms, dribbled and, with Tina Thompson
defending, turned and dropped in a layup that gave the Mercury a
53-51 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt great,'' Gillom said. ``I had been struggling all
night. But I didn't care if I didn't make another shot, as long as
I made that one.''
</P>
<P>
   It completed a game during which the runner-up in this year's
voting for Most Valuable Player, Gillom, got the best of it despite
a championship-record 29 points by Cooper, the two-time MVP.
</P>
<P>
   Missed shots told the tale for the Comets, who were well under
40 percent most of the game and finished at 32.3 percent
(21-for-65). And the final seconds epitomized their plight. Sheryl
Swoopes (3-for-14) had an open look but missed from 12 feet with
less than three seconds left. Michelle Griffiths grabbed the
rebound, was fouled by Yolanda Moore and made one of two free
throws for a 54-51 lead with 1.5 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Van Chancellor called a timeout and, Swoopes said, ``told
us not to give up, that we still had time.''
</P>
<P>
   Time and opportunity. But a 3-point try by Cooper from near
midcourt missed. And the Mercury had a win that put its coach
within a victory of making good on her vow.
</P>
<P>
   ``The shot that I took with 2.3 seconds left,'' Swoopes said,
``did the same thing all of my shots did tonight. It went in and
came back out.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper was 11-for-24 and was the only Comet to score in double
figures. Swoopes had eight points, but no one else had more than
four.
</P>
<P>
   Of her final shot, Cooper said: ``You don't win or lose in the
last second of a ballgame. You hope and pray in the last 10
seconds. But you win a game in the first 39 minutes. And for the
first 39 minutes tonight, we didn't play our game. As a result, we
found ourselves in a very difficult situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither team will want to brag about its shooting. Phoenix,
which outrebounded the Comets 41-32, was 22-for-63 from the floor
for 34.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Comets came out strong and went ahead 18-10 following
five straight points by Cooper, they cooled off rapidly from that
point on. Phoenix caught fire and, with Gillom and Timms each
scoring nine points in the period, mounted a 33-29 lead at
halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Two free throws by Gillom with 15:34 to go in the game gave the
Mercury a 41-33 lead, its biggest. But then, the Mercury couldn't
find the basket. Nine straight misses and a turnover cleared a path
for the Comets to gain steam behind six points from Cooper. And
when Monica Lamb connected with 7:44 left, the Comets led 46-45.
</P>
<P>
   But a 3-pointer from Kristi Harrower ended the Mercury's drought
and overhauled the Comets 48-47.
</P>
<P>
   ``We dodged some bullets,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   Harrower had a layup two minutes later to tie the score at 51
with 2:38 left. The rest of the game was a frenetic show of
basketball that ended with Gillom delivering the dagger.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew if Jennifer got a shot that she'd make it,'' said
Chancellor, who coached Gillom at Mississippi. ``It was special for
her. I wish it had been a little short. I love her, but I love us
more.''
</P>
<P>
   What remains now, Cooper said, is for the Comets to return home,
go back to the drawing board and adjust the offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely nothing the Phoenix Mercury did tonight was the
reason we played the way we did,'' she said. ``They should be
worried about their offense, why they scored only 54 points. We're
worried about why we only scored 51 points. The bottom line is we
didn't play the style of basketball that we're capable of playing.
We've got to go back and make adjustments so that we do play that
way.''

TELLABS RENEGOTIATES CIENA DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By LAURA M. HOLSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tellabs Inc. is expected to announce Friday that it has
renegotiated its agreement to acquire Ciena Corp., executives close
to the talks said late Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new terms, which were still being worked out Thursday
night after the board of Tellabs met all day Tuesday to discuss a
renegotiated settlement, Ciena shareholders are expected to receive
eight-tenths of a share of Tellabs for each Ciena share they own.
</P>
<P>
   That would value the deal _ based on Tellabs' closing stock
price of $57.8125 Thursday _ at more than $4.8 billion. The
previous value of the deal, which was based on a one-for-one swap,
was estimated at $7.1 billion. Shares of Ciena closed Thursday at
$30.8125, down $3.4375.
</P>
<P>
   Several analysts had expected the merger to be renegotiated
because of two setbacks earler this month.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 14, Ciena announced that its third-quarter profit would
be less than half of expectations _ between 13 cents and 15 cents a
share. Analysts, according to a survey by First Call Corp., an
investment research company, had expected Ciena to earn 32 cents a
share.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Ciena fell $17.625, or 23.9 percent, to $54.125, on
the news earlier this month, while Tellabs' shares dropped
$13.6875, or 19 percent, to $58.125. When the deal was announced in
June, a mere 62.5 cents separated the value of the two stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts had long considered Ciena's operations, which make
equipment that can increase the capacity of long-distance networks,
to be high risk. The company has only 11 customers, led by Sprint
and Worldcom, which together made up 95 percent of its sales last
year. But few expected the company to post such a setback.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Nettles, Ciena's chief executive, attributed his
company's troubles to a delay in a $25 million order and a large
discount that was given to an important customer in exchange for
future volume sales.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the two companies then began discussing a
renegotiation by phone, talks that lasted for two weeks, an
executive close to the negotiations said.
</P>
<P>
   Then, on the heels of the earnings news, came a disclosure from
AT&AMP;T Corp. that it had decided not to buy Ciena's technology for
expanding the capacity of fiber optic networks.
</P>
<P>
   For Ciena, the timing could not have been worse. AT&AMP;T delivered
the news to Nettles less than an hour before Ciena and Tellabs were
to convene separate shareholder meetings in Baltimore and Lisle,
Ill., to vote on their merger.
</P>
<P>
   Because most analysts on Wall Street assumed that AT&AMP;T would buy
$100 million worth of equipment from Ciena next year _ accounting
for more than 11 percent of its expected revenue _ Tellabs and
Ciena then decided to postpone the votes until Sept. 9.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Michael Birck, the chief executive of Tellabs, said
that he thought that the deal would move forward.
</P>
<P>
   But he declined to say whether the terms would remain the same.
Several analysts said then that they thought that the deal would
still go ahead but that the terms would have to be renegotiated in
Tellabs' favor.

   WRIGHTSVILLE BEACH, N.C. _ Two years ago, residents of this
surfside resort just east of Wilmington returned to their island
after the passing of Hurricane Fran and found utter devastation.
Sand dunes were flattened. Beachfront houses were swamped. Boats
were tossed ashore.
</P>
<P>
   They found none of that Thursday as they streamed back to survey
the damage from Hurricane Bonnie, which blew through this area on
Wednesday afternoon. A few shingles were missing, a few dwellings
and businesses had water damage.
</P>
<P>
   The dunes, artificially replenished earlier this year, had lost
a bit of sand. A single small boat, the Bahama Gem, had been lifted
out of the marsh and deposited on a muddy bank. Even the Shell
Island Resort, a beachfront condominium that is close to falling
into the sea, suffered little noticeable damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very fortunate,'' said Ed Taylor, an assistant to the
town manager.
</P>
<P>
   In Brunswick County, just south of Wilmington, officials
expressed amazement at the dearth of significant destruction.
``It's totally unreal, especially as big as this hurricane was and
as long as it hung around,'' said Cecil Logan, a spokesman for the
county's disaster services. That was the sentiment up and down the
North Carolina coast Thursday as coastal residents, waterlogged but
relieved, awoke to the realization that Hurricane Bonnie had not
lived up to her advance notices.
</P>
<P>
   Although the National Hurricane Center reported that the
category 3 storm carried maximum sustained winds of 115 mph, there
were few physical signs that its power had been that intense. Some
longtime residents said they had developed an ear for hurricanes,
and could tell from the sound of the hurricane that it would not be
as destructive as Fran, which caused nearly $6 billion in property
damage.
</P>
<P>
   State officials said it was too early to make a dollar
assessment of the damage from the latest hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   Grover Gore, a 66-year-old lawyer who has lived for 33 years on
the Cape Fear River in Southport, said that really bad storms would
progress from whistling to howling to roaring to screeching to
screaming. ``We had screeching but we didn't have as much of it as
with Fran,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As the hurricane was downgraded to a tropical storm Thursday,
with winds of 70 mph slowly churning northward through eastern
North Carolina, there were still no reports of deaths or serious
injuries from it. Many of the injuries that were reported by area
hospitals, including electric shocks and carbon monoxide poisoning,
resulted from the improper use of generators.
</P>
<P>
   There were, of course, plenty of ecological consequences,
particularly for sand dunes and rain-sodden rivers. The Pamlico
River washed over its banks in places near Washington, N.C., as did
the Neuse River in New Bern, where major highways were closed. Many
cities in the region received between nine and 11 inches of
rainfall in the last two days.
</P>
<P>
   Residents in Carolina Beach, just south of here, close to where
the eye of the storm made landfall, reported that several feet of
sand had washed ashore on the north end of their island.
</P>
<P>
   At North Topsail Beach, early assessments indicated that 60
percent of the dunes had washed away, some in half-mile long
chunks. On one end of the island, a truck was buried in sand to the
tops of its tires. Boardwalks were twisted and torn away and some
houses were perched precariously near the edge of the water,
because of beach and dune erosion.
</P>
<P>
   North Topsail Beach, with the help of the Federal Emergency
Management Agency, had spent $2 million replenishing the dunes
blown away by Hurricanes Fran and Bertha in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just going to have to start over again,'' said Tony
Hammond, the town manager. ``The ones that had the vegetation
seemed to have held up better. The ones with limited vegetation
didn't do as well.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, President Clinton declared North Carolina a
disaster area, making it eligible for federal assistance like loans
to farmers and emergency assistance for food and clothing. The aid
was announced in a telephone call between Gov. James Hunt Jr. and
White House Chief of Staff Erskine Bowles, who has said he is
considering a campaign for governor of North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Another hurricane, Danielle, was ``following behind on the heels
of Bonnie'' in the Atlantic with winds approaching 90 mph., said
Jorge Aguirre, a meterologist with the National Hurricane Center in
Miami. He said it was too soon to predict the path of Hurricane
Danielle.
</P>
<P>
   As Tropical Storm Bonnie slogged back toward the Atlantic
Thursday night, winds picked up when the center of the storm
reached Kitty Hawk on the Outer Banks, reaching hurricane status
again at 11 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Almost everyone here suffered some inconvenience from the
hurricane, but little more. As of 4 p.m. Thursday, some 248,000
households and businesses remained without electricity in eastern
North Carolina, state officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities on many barrier islands kept bridges closed,
preventing evacuated residents from returning to their homes,
because they were still checking for downed power lines and for
damage to water and sewage systems. As they waited for hours at a
checkpoint at the foot of the bridge to Carolina Beach, many
residents could not hide their frustration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't leave again,'' said J. Nicole Haywood. ``I may die in
the next one, but I won't leave. This just irks me to death.''
</P>
<P>
   After more than a day without power, many residents were
desperate for hot showers and hot meals. At Johnny's Deli and New
York Style Pizzeria, one of the first restaurants in Wilmington to
open Thursday morning, a line of eager customers stretched out the
door at 11 a.m. Pizza for brunch? Why not, said Wendy R. Kulp, a
22-year-old Wilmington woman who survived the hurricane on a diet
of potato chips and apples.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard on the radio that it was open,'' she said. ``We looked
it up in the yellow pages and rushed over here as fast as we could.
The thought of hot food and cooked cheese sounds really good.''
</P>
<P>
   Others waiting for pizza said they were happy to get outside
after spending Wednesday trapped indoors. ``I'm really sick of
talking to them,'' said Tracey Hopkins, gesturing toward her two
roommates. ``And we've done all the crossword puzzles in People
magazine for the last three months.''

EDMONDS IN SWING

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ He was coming off a two-homer game at Yankee Stadium
the night before and is batting .303 with 20 homers and 71 RBI this
season, but Jim Edmonds says 1998 has been a struggle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel I've had a mediocre year,'' he said. ``I've tried to do
too much. I changed my stance a little bit and it didn't work. I
changed back and have been trying to catch up. You can't do that.
It's definitely a learning process every year you go out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Since sitting out three games last weekend because of a bruised
back, Edmonds has come out swinging, hitting .471 in four games.
There's no doubting Edmonds' importance to the team, Angels manager
Terry Collins says.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Jim Edmonds plays the next 30 games the way Jim Edmonds can
play, we'll win,'' Collins said matter-of-factly.
</P>
<P>
   As far as the two homers in the second game of Wednesday's
doubleheader, Edmonds says yes, it was special.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty exciting to hit one here, because I'd never hit
one here before,'' he said. ``It was the only American League park
I'd never homered. But it would have been better if we could have
won the game.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Unusual glare: The Angels normally don't get a lot of
national attention, but playing well against the Yankees has
changed things a little for now.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're going to be in the spotlight, this will help,''
Collins said. ``People start to know your players and it helps
players get exposure. Our guys have got a lot of attention here and
they've responded positively to it.''
</P>
<P>
   However, they haven't reached the status of the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not a household name,'' Collins said. ``We even
 &UR; !ital! &LR; changed &UR; !off! &LR;  our name (from California to Anaheim).''
</P>
<P>
   __ Playoff musings: If the Angels win the AL West, they'll play
either the Yankees or the Red Sox in the first round. They say it
doesn't matter who they play, as long as they get there.
</P>
<P>
   But what about the Yankees? They would play either the Angels or
Indians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Either team could be difficult in a short series,'' Yankees
pitcher David Cone told a New York newspaper. ``Anaheim's got
quality hitters and the outfielders are as good as they come. And
Cleveland, we know what they did to us last year. It's pick your
poison.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Erstad battles: Darin Erstad drew praise for his at-bat in
the top of the ninth inning in Wednesday's second game. The Angels
trailed 6-5 and had Paco Martin on first with two out. Erstad fell
behind in the count 0-2.
</P>
<P>
   But he fouled off five pitches with two strikes, worked the
count full, then drilled the ball into the right-field corner to
score Martin and tie the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Erstad's at-bat (Wednesday) night should be taped and sent out
to every baseball organization,'' Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Celebrity clubhouse: The Angels' clubhouse before Thursday's
game was a who's who of former players, all of whom are
broadcasters now.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy John, Bobby Murcer and Jeff Torborg roamed the clubhouse,
but none got more attention than Torborg's son, Gale, who is a
professional wrestler with the WCW.

DODGERS SWEEP EXPOS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ He's back but not in Dodger Blue.
</P>
<P>
   For four games, beginning tonight, Mike Piazza will be back
behind the plate at Dodger Stadium _ wearing the shade of blue that
belongs to the New York Mets. He'll also be a lot closer to the
playoffs than his former teammates.
</P>
<P>
   But if the past three days are any indication, the Los Angeles
Dodgers are working hard at getting back into the race.
</P>
<P>
   A four-run first inning helped lift the Dodgers to a 10-9 win
over the Montreal Expos on Thursday night before a crowd of 30,971
at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The win, which capped a three-game sweep of the Expos, moved the
Dodgers one game closer to the Mets in the race for the National
League's wild-card berth. The Dodgers are six games back in that
race.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets, 11-3 losers Thursday to the San Francisco Giants, are
scheduled to start right-handed pitcher Bobby Jones tonight. For
the Dodgers, lefty Carlos Perez will get the call. First pitch is
at 7:05 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the seemingly close score, Bobby Bonilla's three-run
home run in the first inning put the game out of reach for the
Expos.
</P>
<P>
   Then in the third inning, Eric Young's second homer in as many
games sealed the win. That home run, a 390-foot line drive to left
center, was Young's sixth of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's game was the first start for right-hander Darren
Dreifort since he injured his elbow in a second-inning brawl
against the Atlanta Braves on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The brawl began when Braves slugger Andres Galarraga charged the
mound after being hit by a pitch. On Thursday, with his team facing
the St. Louis Cardinals, Galarraga began serving a three-day
suspension for his role in the incident.
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort went 72/3 innings, gave up 11 hits and allowed seven
runs. He struck out six. The win boosted his record to 7-12 and
pulled him out of a slump in which his previous four decisions were
all losses.
</P>
<P>
   Montreal starter Jeremy Powell was pulled after pitching just
two innings. He gave up five hits, including two home runs, and hit
Gary Sheffield in the hip with a wild pitch.
</P>
<P>
   His replacement, right-hander Miguel Bautista, pitched three
innings, giving up four hits and three runs, and striking out four.
</P>
<P>
   The Expos most significant threat came with two out in the
eighth inning when pinch-hitter Chris Widger hit a grand slam off
Dreifort on an 0-2 count. It was the second pinch-hit grand slam by
an Expos player this season.
</P>
<P>
   A two-run home run by Vladimir Guerrero off Antonio Osuna in the
ninth inning brought the Expos to within one run. Scott Radinsky
came in and retired the next two batters for the save.
</P>
<P>
   Adrian Beltre, filling in for Bonilla, answered with a home run
in the bottom half of the eighth inning, his fifth of the season.

YANKEES TOP ANGELS IN EXTRA INNINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Their usually precise starter failed miserably, their
usually reliable middle reliever stumbled as a closer, but their
unreliable setup man and a rookie making his major league debut
finally pitched sharply enough for the Yankees to erase some of
their concerns and give them life last night. Just when the Angels
were poised to smack the Yankees one last time before they boarded
an airplane, the Yankees smacked back.
</P>
<P>
   Bernie Williams snapped an 0-for-12 slump in stylish fashion by
blasting a double off the center-field fence against Mike Fetters
to score Derek Jeter from second base and lift the Yankees to a
thrilling 6-5 victory in 11 innings. Jay Tessmer, who had never
even been in Yankee Stadium until Wednesday, pitched a scoreless
inning to win his first major league game on a memorable night.
</P>
<P>
   So the Yankees snatched the last two games of what could have
been a much more frustrating five-game series against a team they
might meet in the post-season.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the loss, the Angels gave the Yankees something to
ponder if the clubs do play in October by winning 6 of their 11
games this season and finishing as the only team with a winning
mark against the Yankees and the only team to win a series at the
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Or, did the Yankees give the Angels something to ponder by
beating them in their final at-bat the final two nights?
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a pride factor involved in this,'' said Manager Joe
Torre. ``Someone asked me if we needed to win this game. We didn't
need it for the standings. But we needed this game for our psyche
and for our pride. You don't want anyone coming in your house and
rearranging your furniture. We held our own.''
</P>
<P>
   They did it because Jeter reached on a walk to open the 11th
and, one out later, the Angels pitched to Williams instead of
walking him and pitching to Paul O'Neill. It was a delicate
decision for Terry Collins, but walking Williams would have set up
a double play. Besides, Chad Curtis was on deck after O'Neill.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a choice, O'Neill or Williams,'' said Torre, whose team
is 96-36 and has already matched its victory total for all of 1997.
``I like our chances with either one of those guys trying to knock
in the run.''
</P>
<P>
   So after David Cone's control deserted him, after Ramiro Mendoza
failed to do an imitation of Mariano Rivera and after Mike Stanton
may have proved that he is back with one and two-thirds shutout
innings, the game belonged to Tessmer. All the rookie did was
retire the Angels 1-2-3 with two strikeouts and explode in
excitement as center fielder Jim Edmonds collided with the fence
and failed to corral Williams's shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd have to say I'm the happiest guy in the Stadium,'' said
Tessmer. ``When he hit the ball, I was praying he didn't catch it.
I can't explain how it felt. It was unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Knoblauch's sacrifice fly in the eighth, a ball he hit in
the air that Torre was actually happy about, gave the Yankees a 5-4
lead. But Mendoza permitted a run-scoring single to Orlando
Palmeiro that tied it at 5-5, and the game remained that way until
the 11th.
</P>
<P>
   Cone was nicked for a run in the third on Randy Velarde's
two-out single, but he fashioned 1-2-3 innings in the first,
second, fourth and fifth and looked smooth as he took a 3-1 edge
into the sixth. All Cone needed to do was maintain the lead or hope
the bullpen held it and he would be one triumph away from his
second 20-victory season.
</P>
<P>
   But Cone turned into Mark Wohlers into the sixth by walking
three straight. Cone fell behind 2-0 on Tim Salmon and staggered
off the mound like someone who had been tossed out of a moving cab
on Fifth Avenue. But help was not summoned and Salmon's fly to
center chopped New York's lead to 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels had left-handed hitters Edmonds and Garret Anderson
due up and the Yankees had left-hander Graeme Lloyd warming up.
Edmonds was 4 for 23 off Cone and 2 for 8 off Lloyd, but Torre said
he did not consider removing Cone. It was a mistake as Edmonds
pounded a double to right-center field that scored two and gave the
Angels a 4-3 lead. Lloyd replaced Cone and got Anderson to ground
out. But the lead was gone, Cone was done and Torre had been wrong.
O'Neill's sacrifice fly tied the game, 4-4, in the seventh. Still,
Cone was miffed by his performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought this game was very important,'' said Cone. ``I was
fired up for it. For the first five innings, I was on track. Then I
got out of sync.''
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Finley, the 6-foot-6-inch left-hander with the nasty
split-finger fastball, had held the Yankees to one run in 15
innings this season and had won his last five decisions against
them. Torre offered a possible strategy of staying even with the
Angels until Finley departed, which the Yankees did in stopping
Anaheim, 3-0, in 10 innings on July 30.
</P>
<P>
   But Finley was not as dominant last night. With two outs in the
fourth and the Angels ahead by 1-0, Chili Davis drilled a 2-1
fastball into the right-field bleachers and gave the Yanks a 2-1
lead with his first homer in pinstripes. It was Davis's most
important hit as a Yankee, but it was not the most pivotal hit of
the night. That came from Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any team that comes in here, they're going to have to beat
us,'' said Davis. ``It's been that way all year. I haven't been
here for all of it, but this team doesn't lie down or relax. That's
just the way it is.''

ANGELS' STRATEGY BACKFIRES IN N.Y.
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.1998 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ By now, anything less than a thrilling game between
the Angels and New York Yankees would be a drastic deviation from
the norm.
</P>
<P>
   Said Angels manager Terry Collins: ``It's been a great series,
but I'll be glad to get out of here. These games have been tough.''
</P>
<P>
   And he said that !ital!before!off! Bernie Williams doubled home
Derek Jeter with the winning run in the bottom of the 11th inning
for a 6-5 Yankees victory in front of 29,213 at Yankee Stadium on
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a real tough one,'' Collins said afterward. ``It's one of
those games where ... you can't walk eight (actually nine) guys and
not do the fundamental things against the New York Yankees and win
ballgames.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, it was the walk the Angels didn't give up that cost
them.
</P>
<P>
   Williams came to the plate with Jeter on second and first base
open with one out. Williams went into the game leading the league
in hitting with a .341 average.
</P>
<P>
   But the Angels decided to have Mike Fetters pitch to Williams,
who hit a drive off the fence in left-center field that Jim Edmonds
nearly caught. Instead, Edmonds re-injured his bruised upper back
crashing into the fence and Jeter scored.
</P>
<P>
   ``We figured with Fetters' forkball, we had a decent chance go
get him,'' Collins said. ``But we didn't. (On-deck hitter Paul)
O'Neill has killed us. We thought if we could get Williams, we
could walk O'Neill and pitch to (Chad) Curtis.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Angels finished the five-game series with two
losses but headed to Boston with a sense of accomplishment, having
won three of five from baseball's best team.
</P>
<P>
   ``On any given night, we can compete with anybody,'' Collins
said. ``On a given night, we'll compete with the Yankees, Braves,
Astros, anybody. We have a good team. These games the emotions were
high, the adrenaline was flowing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hardest part about winning the first three is when you
have a chance to win the next two and don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Fetters (2-8), one of five relievers to follow starter Chuck
Finley, got the loss. Jay Tessmer (1-0) pitched the 11th and got
the win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I've ever been involved in a tougher four
days,'' Collins said. ``The games are so grueling, so hard. We gave
absolute-maximum effort, gave everything we had. It's the longest
four days I've ever spent.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's game was billed as a matchup between two of the best
starters in the league but became a battle of bullpens.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Finley nor Yankees starter David Cone made it out of the
sixth inning, leaving the game to the relievers.
</P>
<P>
   Finley left the game in the sixth inning leading 4-3, but the
Yankees had runners on first and second with nobody out. Pep Harris
came in and got out of the inning in only 11 pitches.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees scored one run in both the seventh and eighth
innings, aided by throwing errors by the Angels each inning.
</P>
<P>
   But true to recent form, the Angels, trailing 5-4, rallied in
the ninth against Yankees reliever Ramiro Mendoza.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Walbeck singled, went to second on a sacrifice and scored
the tying run on Orlando Palmeiro's one-out single.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, it only delayed the loss by a couple innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an exhausting situation,'' a weary Edmonds said. ``To see
the level of intensity on the bench for five games and to finish
with an 11-inning game, I'm almost relieved it's over.''
</P>
<P>
   But will they meet again?
</P>
<P>
   ``They're an outstanding team with a great manager and good
coaches,'' Collins said. ``But we want a chance to play them in
October. I want that opportunity.''

</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-COALITION (Moscow) _ In his drive to consolidate power,
Viktor Chernomyrdin has embarked on the first attempt since the
fall of the Soviet Union to negotiate a sharing of power between
the remains of the Communist Party and the tycoons who arose from
the ashes of socialism. Chernomyrdin has sent unmistakable signals
that he wants to form a coalition government that embraces tycoons
and Communists alike. But the final outcome of that effort to
reconcile such opposing forces is by no means clear, and the
politics of Chernomyrdin's coalition-building is at odds with the
economic crisis in which Russia finds itself. By Michael R. Gordon.

   RUSSIA-U.S. (Washington) _ Where is Washington on the mess in

<P>
   RUSSIA-EUROPE (Paris) _ With the monetary crisis in Russia
creating turmoil in global financial markets, concern grew in
European capitals Thursday that the crisis could throttle economic
growth in their own countries or weaken Russia's commitment to
democracy. But with Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany in the fight
of his life for re-election a month from now and with President
Clinton and President Boris N. Yeltsin both seen to be in weakened
political positions, few here saw much chance of quick, decisive
action during the U.S.-Russian summit meeting planned for next week
in Moscow. By Craig R. Whitney.

how they can scale over it, bore through it or burrow under it. The
breathtaking scenery that inspired Grieg's symphonies, Munch's

   MARKET-LOSES (New York) _ How bad was Thursday's stock market
selloff? Really bad. By almost every statistical measure, share

headlines are even uglier than some investors realize. The result:
huge paper losses have accumulated for millions of investors in a

<P>
   COMMODITIES-MARKETPLACE (New York) _ While millions of investors
focused on the global plunge in stock markets Thursday, a key index

long run than the 3 percent fall in the Dow Jones industrial index.

EMIGRES SHARE RUSSIA WORRIES

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As the economic and political chaos escalated in
Russia on Thursday, many area emigres watched and worried.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before, it was a big-power country. Now when I think about it
I just want to cry,'' said Boris Kramskoy, 66, of North Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Kramskoy, speaking through a translator, said he worries about
his friends in Russia, particularly the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The current crisis in Russia is very bad. They're having a
hard time. They're not getting their salary on time,'' said Mike
Ray, a West Hollywood resident who owns the European Meat Market in
North Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Ray, 52, returned two weeks ago from a visit to his
mother-in-law in a suburb outside Moscow, during which he
distributed money and food.
</P>
<P>
   Lana Vosicher, an accounts manager at Adat Ari El, a synagogue
in North Hollywood, was not as concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been here so long, why should I care? I've been here
18 years,'' she said. ``That country is out of mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Kira, publisher of the national Russian-language
newspaper Contact and president of the Cable Russian Network Inc.,
said events in Russia could impact the United States. If, for
instance, Russia reverts to a military regime, Kira believes more
Russian Jews will be motivated to emigrate.
</P>

   One business that is keeping a close eye on Russia is J.T.
Granatelli Lubricants. The Camarillo, Calif.-based company struck a
deal in January to supply Russian petroleum companies and
refineries with motor oil additives and similar products.
</P>
<P>
   Harry Hibler, the company's president, said after spending two
years to develop ties with Russians, clients there had warned of
the crisis three months ago so he was prepared to slow shipments.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one of the biggest things any company that deals with
that area can do is to have a relationship with someone who they
trust to let them know what's really going on there,'' Hibler said.
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans, for now, have little to worry about, one expert
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see any major disaster. ... It creates uncertainty,
and I suppose people may be more cautious about spending,'' said
Robert Krol, an economics professor at California State University,
Northridge. ``The greater concern is how will the U.S. government
change in terms of policy. ... My hunch is that they won't have
much reaction.''

SILENT BATS STILL PLAGUE D-BACKS  
 2-HITTER GIVES BREWERS 1ST SHUTOUT OF SEASON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DON KETCHUM

<TEXT>
<P>
   After two straight victories over the New York Mets ended their
road trip on an uplifting note, the Diamondbacks hoped to build on
that with a strong effort in a six-game homestand this week against
Pittsburgh and Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   But they dropped the first two to the Pirates, and on Thursday
night watched the Brewers put on a Roque horror pitcher show.
</P>
<P>
   Left-hander Rafael Roque, making only his fourth start of the
season, quieted the Diamondbacks on two hits through seven innings,
and veteran right-hander Eric Plunk did the rest as Milwaukee
recorded its first shutout of the season with a 4-0 victory at Bank
One Ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   The Brewers, who were the only team in the major leagues without
a shutout, raised their record to 64-70. Arizona fell to 50-85.
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee's last shutout was Aug. 24, 1997, when right-hander
Jose Mercedes beat Detroit, 6-0. The losing pitcher for the Tigers
was right-hander Willie Blair, who went on to sign a free-agent
deal with the Diamondbacks during the off-season.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks had only one runner go beyond first base
against Roque.
</P>
<P>
   Shortstop Jay Bell connected on the first pitch of the seventh
inning for a single to right-center field. He advanced to second on
a wild pitch and moved to third on a fly ball to deep center by
Travis Lee for the second out, but was stranded there when Bernard
Gilkey grounded out for the final out of the inning.
</P>
<P>
   The only other hit off Roque (2-1) was a broken-bat single to
shallow center by Lee to lead off the second, but Lee was erased on
an inning-ending double-play grounder by Yamil Benitez.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had trouble scoring runs all year,'' said Diamondbacks
Manager Buck Showalter, whose team was shut out for the 12th time
in its first season.
</P>
<P>
   Roque made his first major league start against the Diamondbacks
in Milwaukee on Aug. 1. He pitched four innings and gave up three
runs on five hits and was not involved in the decision.
</P>
<P>
   He was sent down to Triple-A Louisville, recalled Aug. 16 and
made starts against the San Diego Padres that day and Aug. 22,
winning the second.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to compare Thursday night's outing with his first against
Arizona, Roque said, ``Today, I threw more fastballs. Right now,
I'm just trying to stay here.''
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Bobby Hughes said that once he saw Roque's fastball was
consistent, he suggested that the pitcher mix it up, working both
the inner and outer halves of the plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when I knew he would be effective,'' Hughes said.
</P>
<P>
   Brewers Manager Phil Garner was glad to get the shutout,
although he said that if the team didn't, it wouldn't have been
embarrassing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what it would mean, other than we obviously are
not getting it done,'' Garner said. ``Frustrating, strange, maybe .
. .''
</P>
<P>
   Roque and Diamondbacks right-hander Andy Benes were locked in a
scoreless duel until first baseman David Nilsson hit a rope out of
the park to right field with one out in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   It was the only run given up by Benes (11-13), who lost his
second straight. Benes did have trouble with Jeff Cirillo, who
collected three hits off him. Cirillo also hit a two-run double off
right-hander Felix Rodriguez in the ninth inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although I gave up a lot of hits (nine in eight innings), I
thought I pitched fairly well,'' Benes said. ``But am I satisfied?
No. You're never satisfied when you lose.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the other guys are pitching well like they were tonight,
you've got to go out and put zeroes up on the board, because one
run is too many to give up.'' &QL;

JAPAN STOCKS FALL 2 PERCENT, BUT REBOUND FROM A 12-YEAR LOW 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Stock markets around Asia nose-dived in early trading on
Friday, as investors feared that the deep Russian economic crisis
would hinder economic growth in the West and slow a recovery in
this region.
</P>
<P>
   The benchmark Nikkei index of 225 issues at one point plunged
during morning trading to its lowest level since March 1986, down
621 points, or 4.3 percent, to 13,792.76. It then recouped much of
those losses, to stand at 14,128.97 at the midday recess _ down
284.82 points, or nearly 2 percent, from Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, the key index in Singapore was off 0.3 percent, to
908.24; down 2.87 percent, to 305.55, in South Korea, and down 2.86
percent, to 2,487.40 in Australia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most basic thing is not to panic,'' the Japanese finance
minister, Kiichi Miyazawa, said at a regular news conference on
Friday morning. Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi said he hoped that
Russia's problems would not have a major impact on the world
economy.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese yen strengthened against the dollar, trading here
at 140.6, as currency traders sold dollars in reaction to the sharp
fall in New York stocks on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Friday morning's early panic in Asian markets subsided a little
in later trading. Funds linked to the government in Taiwan helped
lift stocks there from lows, and institutional investors in
Singapore began buying after an early selloff by retail investors.
</P>
<P>
   In Hong Kong, monetary authorities again intervened to buy
stocks. Still, at midmorning, the benchmark Hang Seng index was
down 66.37 points, or 0.8 percent, at 7,856.60.
</P>
<P>
   Asian countries have been highly sensitive to troubles elsewhere
because of the impact that outside economic shocks could have on
fragile economic recoveries here. South Korea announced on Thursday
that its economic growth for the second quarter ended on June 30
contracted by 6.6 percent on an annual basis.
</P>
<P>
   Japan, too, is struggling to deal with an overwhelming banking
crisis that has engulfed the nation, and Hong Kong is battling an
economic contraction and a spike in interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sitting here watching the world falling to pieces,'' said
Richard Jerram, an economist at ING Baring Securities Japan.
Referring to governments in the region, he added, ``The question
is, what can they do?''
</P>
<P>
   Investors in Asia are worried that exports, the bright prospect
for the struggling economies here, may subside if markets in Europe
and the United States suffer from a fallout from Russia. Western
economies are sensitive to the Russian debt crisis through their
commercial debt exposure and through investments in the capital
markets, with Germany, Moscow's biggest trading partner, most
directly exposed.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a weakening in Western stock markets could mean
that Western buyers of goods would have less ability to absorb
exports from Asia.
</P>
<P>
   So in Tokyo, the shares of export manufacturers were hard hit,
with even the favorite stocks like the Toyota Motor Co. and the
Sony Corp. tumbling. Some banking stocks had no buyers.

SWANN: SIGN TOP DRAFT PICK  
 PLUMMER, OTHERS WANT WADSWORTH IN CARDS' FOLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LEE SHAPPELL  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Enough is enough, several Cardinals players said Thursday. Get
Andre Wadsworth signed, sealed and delivered, for the good of the
team and a community that finally is showing interest in the
franchise.
</P>
<P>
   The most outspoken about the club's refusal to budge from its
negotiating position with the holdout first-round draft pick is the
man who has squeezed the biggest paycheck from ownership, Pro Bowl
tackle Eric Swann. In February, Swann received a club record $7.5
million signing bonus in a five-year, $25 million package.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a ton of people finally excited about the Arizona
Cardinals,'' Swann said. ``The organization has to be aware that in
this business, if you disappoint your fans time in and time out,
soon you'll have no fans. I've had enough of playing in a stadium
where three-fourths of the fans are for the opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here we have a chance to turn it around. You have to do it
right and get it done. On one hand, the organization is saying,
`Trust me, believe in me,' but they have to do what is right to
earn that. The worst thing in the world is to violate the trust of
a fan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're finally to the point where most of our players have the
attitude that they really want to win. It's important to me to win,
to know what that feels like because we never have here. That takes
bringing our good players in. We need to get this done. ''
</P>
<P>
   Recent indications are that Wadsworth is willing to sit out the
season and go back into the 1999 draft and that the club is willing
to let him. In fact, while Phoenix radio station KGME maintains
that Wadsworth has decided to sit out the season, Cardinals
officials said they spent Thursday afternoon exchanging proposals
with his agent, Eugene Parker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I defintely feel this isn't over,'' said Cardinals Vice
President Bob Ferguson, ``we hope to get this done.''
</P>
<P>
   Wadsworth began graduate school classes at Florida State on
Thursday and plans to serve as a graduate assistant coach for the
Seminoles.
</P>
<P>
   The sticking point is Wadsworth's demand for voidable years at
the midpoint of a long contract. Club owner Bill Bidwill has
authorized an offer to Wadsworth that includes a $10.4 million
signing bonus, the third-highest ever to a rookie. But Bidwill
steadfastly refuses to include voidables.
</P>
<P>
   It's time for both sides to come off their hard-line stances and
make a deal, in Swann's opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was counting on whoever is in charge to do the right things
to get a deal done,'' Swann said. ``He's a valuable asset who was
penciled in as a starter at left defensive end.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's disappointing, knowing we have such a valuable asset on
the shelf. For the last 3{ weeks, Eric Swann has been grieving.''
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Jake Plummer stopped short of saying that he, too,
is grieving. But Plummer made it clear that the time has come for a
resolution to the impasse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we all want to play with our best players around
us,'' Plummer said. ``I'd like to see both sides work to get it
done. But if we don't get him in, we'll still win and still have a
good team.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with a quick resolution, Wadsworth would be hard-pressed to
get ready to play at Dallas in the Sept. 6 season opener.
</P>
<P>
   ``What it does is shift all the plans around,'' said offensive
tackle Lomas Brown, a seven-time Pro Bowler. ``We're asking some
guys to play left defensive end who we otherwise wouldn't have
asked, and that disrupts the whole chemistry of the defense. There
are some guys real frustrated about it on the defensive side.''
</P>
<P>
   Plummer said the club has not suffered a public relations black
eye yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``From reading the paper, it seems a lot of people think Andre
is just a young guy who is greedy,'' Plummer said. ``But the
organization also should be willing to give a little extra, too, to
help get it done.''
</P>
<P>
   Plummer might soon be back at the negotiating table himself. He
has one more year after this one remaining on a contract far below
the market value of a starting NFL quarterback, $595,000. In any
renegotiation, his agent, Leigh Steinberg, may ask for voidable
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not even thinking about that yet,'' Plummer said. ``I've
just got to go play. If I play well and we win, I'll have no
worries.''
</P>
<P>
   Long snapper Trey Junkin has been in the league longer than
anyone on the roster, 16 years. He's seen plenty, but one thing
hasn't changed: an owner's right to do what he wants with his team.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the last time I checked, Bill Bidwill is the owner of the
team,'' Junkin said. ``Nobody can tell him what to do.'' &QL; 
Staff writer Steve Schoenfeld contributed to this report. &QL;

   The New York Times News Service moved the following stories on
the deteriorating economic and political situation in Russia and
its impact around the world.
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-RDP (Moscow) _ Pressure mounted on President Boris N.
Yeltsin Thursday to cede some of his powers or even step aside as
Russia's political leaders frantically negotiated over fundamental
changes in the country's economic policies. His political opponents
pushed for a series of steps that would reverse seven years of
transition to democracy and a market economy and they are proposing
to skirt the constitiution by usurping some of the President's
powers and make him a ceremonial head of the Government. By
Celestine Bohlen. (1stLd)
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-COALITION (Moscow) _ In his drive to consolidate power,
Viktor S. Chernomyrdin has embarked on the first attempt since the
fall of the Soviet Union to negotiate a sharing of power between
the remains of the Communist Party and the tycoons who arose from
the ashes of socialism. Chernomyrdin has sent unmistakable signals
that he wants to form a coalition government that embraces tycoons
and Communists alike. But the final outcome of that effort to
reconcile such opposing forces is by no means clear, and the
politics of Chernomyrdin's coalition-building is at odds with the
economic crisis in which Russia finds itself. By Michael R. Gordon.
(2ndLd)
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-BANKS (Moscow) _ It was a brief but wild ride for
Russia's cowboy banking empires, and like the economy on which they
were saddled, it looks to be meeting a disastrous end. Capping two
weeks of increasingly alarmist rumors, the Russian government said
tonight that it intends to nationalize SBS-Agro Bank, by most
measures the country's third-largest. Within minutes, five more
major banks announced plans to merge. By Michael Wines. (1stLd)
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-U.S. (Washington) _ Where is Washington on the mess in
Russia? By John M. Broder.

   RUSSIA-U.S.-ASSESS (Washington) _ A news analysis on the U.S.
role in the Russian economic and political situation. By R.W. Apple
Jr.

<P>
   RUSSIA-IMF (Washington) _ What is IMF doing? What did
Chernomydin and Camdessus, the IMF chief, say to each other at
their Crimea meeting? By Louis Uchitelle.
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-EUROPE (Paris) _ With the monetary crisis in Russia
creating turmoil in global financial markets, concern grew in
European capitals Thursday that the crisis could throttle economic
growth in their own countries or weaken Russia's commitment to
democracy. But with Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany in the fight
of his life for re-election a month from now and with President
Clinton and President Boris N. Yeltsin both seen to be in weakened
political positions, few here saw much chance of quick, decisive
action during the U.S.-Russian summit meeting planned for next week
in Moscow. By Craig R. Whitney.
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-EUROPE-IMPACT (Frankfurt, Germany) _ Fears of an economic
meltdown in Russia sent shockwaves through Western Europe and put
heavy new pressures on central European nations like Poland,
Hungary and the Czech Republic. In Hungary, the Budapest stock
exchange plunged a heart-stopping 15 percent Thursday and the
central bank intervened to shore up confidence in its currency, the
forint. In Poland, which is the second largest exporter to Russia
after Germany, government leaders warned the country to brace for
slower growth and more stringent economic policies. By Edmund L.
Andrews.
</P>
<P>
   MARKET-INVESTORS (New York) _ Individual investors, whose
determination to buy stocks whenever the market takes a tumble has
been the bulwark of the bull market of the 1990s, appear to be
weakening under the weight of a month-long decline in equity
prices. In recent weeks, individuals have been pouring more of
their new cash into the safe haven of money-market funds than into
any other investment category, while at the same time many of them
have been pulling money out of stocks. So far, August appears to be
the weakest month for new purchases of equity mutual funds in
several years. By Edward Wyatt.
</P>
<P>
   MARKET-LOSES (New York) _ How bad was Thursday's stock market
selloff? Really bad. By almost every statistical measure, share
prices have been suffering some of the worst declines in more than
a decade this August. And in many ways, the numbers behind the
headlines are even uglier than some investors realize. The result:
huge paper losses have accumulated for millions of investors in a
month of volatile and tempestuous trading. By David Barboza.
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-U.S.-BANKS (New York) _ Russia's economic meltdown
claimed another victim on Thursday. The Republic New York Corp.,
considered to be one of the most conservatively managed banks in
the U.S. but one that also trades in some of the world's most
exotic markets, said losses in Russia will wipe out all of its
third quarter earnings. By Timothy L. O'Brien.
</P>
<P>
   MARKET-COMMODITIES (Undated) _ While millions of investors
focused on the globle plunge in stock markets Thursday, a key index
of commodities from oil to cotton fell to a its lowest level in
21-years. And that may be even more worrisome for investors in the
long run than the 4.2 percent fall in the Dow Jones industrial
average. By Jonathan Fuerbringer. (1stLd)
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-EMERGE (Undated) _ A look at the impact of the Russian
economic turmoil as it affects emerging markets. By Jonathan

BRYMER, SEAHAWKS GEAR UP FOR 49ERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIRKLAND, Wash. _ Dennis Erickson and Steve Mariucci agree on
two things entering their teams' preseason finale at the Kingdome
on Friday night:
</P>
<P>
   -- The last thing either wants to see is an injury to one of his
starting players when Erickson's Seahawks host Mariucci's San
Francisco 49ers;
</P>
<P>
   -- And, five preseason games are at least one too many.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five times in the preseason, three hours a day, my heart is in
my mouth, and I'm praying nobody gets hurt,'' Mariucci said after
the 49ers' three-point victory over the Seahawks two weeks ago in
Vancouver, B.C.
</P>
<P>
   Just don't try convincing Chris Brymer the preseason should be
shortened. The Seahawks' rookie free-agent guard will be the one
basking in every moment of the game.
</P>
<P>
   This probably will be Brymer's final game with the Seahawks.
When the roster is trimmed to 53 players on Sunday, Andrew Greene
will be the No. 4 guard behind starters Pete Kendall and Brian
Habib and guard-turned-center Chris Gray. When the five-man
practice squad is compiled Monday, look for the return of
guard-deep snapper Jason McEndoo, the seventh-round draft choice
from Washington State who was released on this week's cut to 60.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no control over that,'' Brymer said. ``The thing I can
do is go out and play my hardest and hopefully things will fall
into place for me. All I can do is play my heart out.''
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, Brymer's final game should have been last week.
</P>
<P>
   Brymer was not invited to play in any of the all-star games
after his senior season at USC, or to the NFL scouting combine in
February. One pre-draft scouting report gave him less than a 25
percent chance of making an NFL roster.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad it happened like that because it made it more of a
challenge,'' Brymer said.
</P>
<P>
   Brymer's first challenge was just getting over the awe-factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so much talent at the position, it was just
unbelievable for me that I was a part of it,'' he said. ``There's
Habib, a Super Bowl champion (with Denver last year). There's
(Kevin) Glover, a Pro Bowler. There's `House' Ballard, another Pro
Bowler. Heck, Kendall is well on his way to being a Pro Bowler. So
is Walter (Jones). He's got to be one of the best athletes I've
ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   And right in the middle of the mix, mixing it up, has been
Brymer, who has more than made up for what he might lack in talent
with determination and desire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had good days, then I have a bad day now and then,''
Brymer said. ``You've just got to forget about that day and move on
to the next. You can't sit there and enjoy the glory or the next
thing you know you're getting put on your butt.''
</P>
<P>
   Brymer had one glorious moment in last week's game against
Arizona when he delivered what is called a pancake block on the
Cardinals' Eric Swann, a 313-pound Pro Bowl defensive tackle.
</P>
<P>
   After being turned and flattened to the ground by Brymer, Swann
was so incensed that he kicked at the rookie and was ejected.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was really mad that some guy came in and took care of
him,'' Brymer said. ``I'm going to remember that all my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for Brymer, the memories of this summer have been
long distance for his wife, who remained in Los Angeles where she
works for an insurance company.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's been working through the whole time, too, knowing I was
a rookie free agent,'' Brymer said. ``She's seen me play, but only
on TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, she'll see him play a lot. Erickson plans to use
his No. 1 offense for only three series, so Brymer and his mates on
the No. 2 line can expect to play almost three quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Not ideal, but better than the alternative, which is getting a
starter injured in a meaningless game.
</P>
<P>
   That's why this night, this game, will belong to players like
Chris Brymer.
</P>
<P>
   HAWK TALK: QB Steve Young was not expected to play for the
49ers. But after Young practiced Thursday, Mariucci said Young

MILLER'S MOUTH CONTINUES TO MAKE LOUD PRESENCE FELT 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Cheryl Miller just can't help it.
</P>
<P>
   She opens her mouth. She makes enemies.
</P>
<P>
   She refuses to talk. She makes enemies.
</P>
<P>
   She grabs a microphone after the Mercury claw to within 40
minutes of the WNBA Championship, conducts a pep rally in the glow
of victory, and she has a dynasty seething.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, my mama has taught me to be humble all my life,''
said Houston's Cynthia Cooper, two-time MVP and pretty much the
Michael Jordan of her league. ``The Bible says to be humble. It
gets to a point . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper shakes her head.
</P>
<P>
   She remembers the last time Miller picked up a microphone. It
was following a Houston victory at America West Arena earlier in
the season, a game when she predicted the two teams would be back
again in August. And then, when it really mattered, the results
would be different.
</P>
<P>
   Say what you want about Miller. But she was right.
</P>
<P>
   So, of course, after a 54-51 victory over the defending
champions, a team that hadn't lost a playoff game in their brief
history, a little gloating was in order.
</P>
<P>
   Whipping a near sellout crowd into delirium, Miller acknowledged
that she had taken some heat for her ``brash statements.'' She
thanked the fans for their support. Then she claimed the series was
``on.'' Except the pronunciation was ``Awwwwwwn,'' the taunting,
salt-in-the-wound version.
</P>
<P>
   And the opponent heard every word.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cheryl said something earlier, that it's the Houston Comets
that are blowing things out of proportion from the previous game
that we played here,'' Cooper said. ``She came back and said some
things tonight. The bottom line is Cheryl doesn't go out on the
court, so I'm not worried about what she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``She can pump up her fans. She can go out in the middle of
downtown and yell and scream. It's great for women's basketball.
It's probably great for the Phoenix Mercury fans. It doesn't matter
to Cynthia Cooper. For me, it doesn't weigh a hill of beans. It
doesn't matter what she says. They didn't beat us. We beat
ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   What all of this means is simple: Like her or not, Miller is a
presence. She has a brother who is one of the top 10 players in the
NBA, a brother who did color commentary for Thursday's game, a
brother who says some of the most cocky things you'll ever hear.
And her personality still smothers his.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, the Houston coach passes out candy to the
scorer's table before the game begins.
</P>
<P>
   The man is slightly overmatched.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, Miller came out bobbing and weaving, clapping
her hands, telling the crowd to pump up the volume. When she
disliked a particular call Thursday, she threw her hands up to her
audience, which broke into a derisive chant targeting the
officials.
</P>
<P>
   All of which built into the crescendo of another post-game
soliloquy, ramifications be damned.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a genuine love affair with us and our fans,'' Miller
said. ``If you're here, if you've been here all season, it's a
genuine love affair between the fans, this team and this staff.
It's just a way of acknowledging them. It's one of the main reasons
we want to bring a championship home to Phoenix.''
</P>
<P>
   It's also the reason that the Comets want to beat her more than
they do anyone in a Mercury uniform. This is either coaching genius
or simply part of an overgrown personality. Either way, she's
always the lightning rod, and hey, some things just run in the
family.
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to like women's basketball. It will never be the
caliber of the NBA. It will never appeal to the masses. But you
can't argue with 13,600 people. You can't debate an attendance base
that continued to grow this season despite scheduling conflicts
with the Diamondbacks. In Phoenix, it's working.
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to like Cheryl Miller, either. A lot of people
don't. But she's good copy. She's a big name in a league short on
headlines. And with another mouthful of bravado, she's added some
competitive drama to a series _ and a league _ that needs all it
can get. &QL;

PINIELLA DRIVEN BY FATE TO SET RECORD HAT TRICK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Not since 1981, when Maury Wills secretly changed the
dimensions of the batter's box to help his pitchers, has a Mariner
manager visited the frontiers of personal goofiness as Lou Piniella
did Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   It was later revealed that Wills had a severe cocaine problem.
Piniella has a drug problem too: He's been drug through a wretched
season.
</P>
<P>
   Piniella certainly can't be faulted for wanting to join Wills in
an altered state. But since Wills' personal effects have long ago
been cleared out of the Kingdome, Piniella, for emotional release,
must rely on more traditional methods.
</P>
<P>
   His first couple of leg swings in the ninth inning at Jacobs
Field were worthy of last year's Seahawk special teams. But as the
tirade wore on into the fourth quarter, he was in sync with his
snapper and holder, getting excellent height and distance.
</P>
<P>
   The kicks may prove to be the longest in sports history: From
Cleveland to Cooperstown, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Since baseball has statistics, categories and awards for
everything, it has to find a place for Piniella's bonnet de boot.
</P>
<P>
   We have seen Piniella kick dirt, throw bases, tackle his own
pitchers, tell off George Steinbrenner and Marge Schott and
threaten to bungee jump off Randy Johnson. But for sheer
entertainment, Wednesday's loopiness deserves a place in the Hall
of Fame, if not its own cable channel.
</P>
<P>
   That hat belongs next to Aaron's 715th, Maris' 61st, McGwire's
pills, Ruth's keg and Jim Bouton's hotel-room keyhole.
</P>
<P>
   There was some fear in Seattle sports that once George Karl was
gone, there would be no one to take us to the edge, where we could
peer into the startling, smarmy abyss. But Piniella has rescued us
from the vanilla middle.
</P>
<P>
   As Robert Duvall put might have put it in ``Apocalypse Now,'' I
love the smell of dysfunction in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   As every armchair psychologist deduced instantly via TV,
Piniella's fury of leg-whipping was not merely about Russ Davis
being erroneously called out on the basepath. The blown call was
just the fuse for unloading a season's worth of managerial
ordnance.
</P>
<P>
   While the TV cameras caught Ken Griffey Jr. and David Segui
snickering in the dugout as Piniella did a one-man impression of
the Radio City Rockettes, it occurred that they were two among a
very few in Mariner blue who were not a part of Lose Crew.
</P>
<P>
   Most Mariners have been significant contributors to Piniella's
trip around the bend. While we don't know for sure, we can take a
guess at the identity of the cats in the hat:
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Ayala: Piniella has been like a father to Ayala, and Ayala
has been like a sun _ look at him and your eyes hurt. Perhaps
Piniella has heard for the 300th time the canard persisting in
Seattle that the relief pitcher married into Piniella's family. If
so, Piniella is talking to the Addams Family about a trade for
Pugsley.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Johnson: He said in spring training he wouldn't talk about
his contract in the media, nor let it bother him. The next day he
was whining in the Los Angeles Times. The rest of his Mariner
career he gave up home runs to every Elmer Fudd in baseball. ``I
baby him, I talk to him, I listen to his crappy music and I say I
like his lousy photographs. He can kiss my Astro roster.''
</P>
<P>
   Russ Davis: ``Son, how many times Igottatellya: See the ball,
catch the ball. That fella across the infield? He's the first
baseman. He's our friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Mariner owners: ``They were rich when they bought the team. Now
they're walking around with their pants pockets turned out, and
they think they know baseball. At least Marge had a nice dog.''
</P>
<P>
   Heathcliff Slocumb: ``Three million bucks for four balls in a
row to the first batter. Fergawdsake, I can pay a buck to a stiff
from a bowling alley for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Woody Woodward: ``No, no, no, Woody! I said, `I want to kill
Randy, not deal Randy!' ''
</P>
<P>
   Himself: Why can't I talk to a young pitcher without scaring the
hell out of him? Why can't I keep a pitching coach? Why can't I
order somebody to bunt a runner along? What was I thinking when I
said in spring I was happy with the bullpen? Doesn't anybody
remember how smart I was in 1995? How did Lee Elia know when to get
out, and why didn't he tell me? Who the hell is Jose Paniagua? Why
can't I ever find my electric shaver? Where's my dignity?
</P>
<P>
   There's more, but you get the idea. Given the burdens under
which he's been operating, it's amazing Piniella didn't blow up
sooner.
</P>
<P>
   He's really not the sort of guy to keep such things under his
hat.

BRYMER, SEAHAWKS GEAR UP FOR 49ERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIRKLAND, Wash. _ Dennis Erickson and Steve Mariucci agree on
two things entering their teams' preseason finale at the Kingdome
on Friday night:
</P>
<P>
   -- The last thing either wants to see is an injury to one of his
starting players when Erickson's Seahawks host Mariucci's San
Francisco 49ers;
</P>
<P>
   -- And, five preseason games are at least one too many.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five times in the preseason, three hours a day, my heart is in
my mouth, and I'm praying nobody gets hurt,'' Mariucci said after
the 49ers' three-point victory over the Seahawks two weeks ago in
Vancouver, B.C.
</P>
<P>
   Just don't try convincing Chris Brymer the preseason should be
shortened. The Seahawks' rookie free-agent guard will be the one
basking in every moment of the game.
</P>
<P>
   This probably will be Brymer's final game with the Seahawks.
When the roster is trimmed to 53 players on Sunday, Andrew Greene
will be the No. 4 guard behind starters Pete Kendall and Brian
Habib and guard-turned-center Chris Gray. When the five-man
practice squad is compiled Monday, look for the return of
guard-deep snapper Jason McEndoo, the seventh-round draft choice
from Washington State who was released on this week's cut to 60.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no control over that,'' Brymer said. ``The thing I can
do is go out and play my hardest and hopefully things will fall
into place for me. All I can do is play my heart out.''
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, Brymer's final game should have been last week.
</P>
<P>
   Brymer was not invited to play in any of the all-star games
after his senior season at USC, or to the NFL scouting combine in
February. One pre-draft scouting report gave him less than a 25
percent chance of making an NFL roster.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad it happened like that because it made it more of a
challenge,'' Brymer said.
</P>
<P>
   Brymer's first challenge was just getting over the awe-factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so much talent at the position, it was just
unbelievable for me that I was a part of it,'' he said. ``There's
Habib, a Super Bowl champion (with Denver last year). There's
(Kevin) Glover, a Pro Bowler. There's `House' Ballard, another Pro
Bowler. Heck, Kendall is well on his way to being a Pro Bowler. So
is Walter (Jones). He's got to be one of the best athletes I've
ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   And right in the middle of the mix, mixing it up, has been
Brymer, who has more than made up for what he might lack in talent
with determination and desire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had good days, then I have a bad day now and then,''
Brymer said. ``You've just got to forget about that day and move on
to the next. You can't sit there and enjoy the glory or the next
thing you know you're getting put on your butt.''
</P>
<P>
   Brymer had one glorious moment in last week's game against
Arizona when he delivered what is called a pancake block on the
Cardinals' Eric Swann, a 313-pound Pro Bowl defensive tackle.
</P>
<P>
   After being turned and flattened to the ground by Brymer, Swann
was so incensed that he kicked at the rookie and was ejected.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was really mad that some guy came in and took care of
him,'' Brymer said. ``I'm going to remember that all my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for Brymer, the memories of this summer have been
long distance for his wife, who remained in Los Angeles where she
works for an insurance company.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's been working through the whole time, too, knowing I was
a rookie free agent,'' Brymer said. ``She's seen me play, but only
on TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, she'll see him play a lot. Erickson plans to use
his No. 1 offense for only three series, so Brymer and his mates on
the No. 2 line can expect to play almost three quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Not ideal, but better than the alternative, which is getting a
starter injured in a meaningless game.
</P>
<P>
   That's why this night, this game, will belong to players like
Chris Brymer.
</P>
<P>
   HAWK TALK: QB Steve Young was not expected to play for the
49ers. But after Young practiced Thursday, Mariucci said Young
might play one series. Young bruised his passing hand by smacking
it on a helmet in the 49ers' game against the Miami Dolphins on
Sunday . . . Injuries will prevent DT Cortez Kennedy (sprained
ankle), WR James McKnight (sprained knee) and LB Darrin Smith
(cracked ribs) from playing for the Seahawks. . . . Rookie K Wade
Richey, released by the Seahawks on Monday, has been claimed off
waivers by the 49ers and will kick for them. ``There's no question
Wade can kick in this league. He has great potential,'' Erickson
said . . . Rookie LB Anthony Simmons, the Seahawks' first-round
draft choice, ran through some agility drills with trainer Jim
Whitesel during Friday's 30-minute walk-through. Simmons has been
sidelined since spraining his right knee in the July 31 preseason
opener at Dallas.

MOYER REACHES 1,000 WHIFFS, 100 WINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM STREET  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ Each of the two numbers ending in zero had special
meaning for Mariner left-hander Jamie Moyer. He said the smallest
one was the most satisfying.
</P>
<P>
   On a night in which the veteran pitcher captured his 100th
major-league victory, he also struck out his 1,000th big-league
batter as the Mariners battered the Cleveland Indians for a change,
pounding out a 10-4 win before 43,142 fans at Jacobs Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the 100 wins,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners scored four runs in the first inning Thursday
night, watched the lead dwindle to one in the fifth, and then
resumed their offensive assault behind home runs from Alex
Rodriguez, a solo shot in the seventh and Joey Cora, a three-run
blast into the right-field seats in the eighth. It was Rodriguez's
career-high 37th home run.
</P>
<P>
   Relievers Jose Paniagua and Mike Timlin surrendered one hit in
three innings of superb mop-up work, giving Seattle its second win
in 11 games this season against the defending American League
champions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cleveland has beaten us up pretty much all season and it's
nice to walk away with a win,'' Moyer said. ``We're still not out
of this (AL West) race yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe not, but the oxygen in their pennant-hope tank is near
empty.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to win a lot of games,'' Moyer added, ``but stranger
things have happened.''
</P>
<P>
   He knows all about long odds.
</P>
<P>
   As a youngster in high school and college, coaches told Moyer he
never would make it as a pro baseball player. He didn't throw hard
enough. He was advised that small, skinny guys don't have a chance.
</P>
<P>
   But guile and determination have been Moyer's version of
muscle-building supplements. He reached the 1,000-strikeout plateau
when he struck out David Bell in the sixth inning, his fourth and
final strikeout of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone had told me three years ago that I would win 100
games, I probably would have said it would take me 30 years to get
there,'' he said. ``But it's a case of being in the right place at
the right time.''
</P>
<P>
   Moyer said he wondered if he ever would climb above the .500
mark.
</P>
<P>
   A 13-3 record with Boston and Seattle in 1996 and 17-5 record
with the M's last season put him over the .500 hump. And he's still
climbing, improving to 11-8 this season.
</P>
<P>
   The latest one wasn't as easy as the score indicated.
</P>
<P>
   Moyer's pursuit of the milestone win came in the sixth inning.
</P>
<P>
   After David Justice sliced a two-run deficit in half with a
one-out home run to left-center, Cleveland put runners on second
and third with two outs.
</P>
<P>
   Kenny Lofton stepped in, already having hit a homer.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Moyer fed the speedy Indians center fielder an
outside pitch that was hit to Rodriguez, and the inning was over.
So was Moyer's 29th start.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting Lofton was the big out of the game,'' manager Lou
Piniella said. ``The bullpen did the rest.''
</P>
<P>
   Paniagua, who has been brilliant since being promoted from Class
AAA Tacoma two weeks ago, shut down the Indians in the seventh and
eighth innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a young kid with only four or five months in the
big-leagues who has come in here and thrown strikes,'' Timlin said
of Paniagua. ``He's throwing good strikes. I had heard that
Montreal thought he had a control problem.''
</P>
<P>
   That hasn't been a problem with Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Paniagua has worked 61/3 innings and walked two batters.
</P>
<P>
   ``He goes right after the hitters,'' Piniella said.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners went right after Indians starter Jaret Wright.
</P>
<P>
   With two outs and Rodriguez on second base in the first inning,
Edgar Martinez walked, David Segui singled home the game's first
run, Russ Davis doubled home another, and Rob Ducey's infield
single and Wright's throwing error produced two more.
</P>
<P>
   Segui's single was the first of his three hits in the series
finale. He also doubled in the third and ninth innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good to see David swinging the bat well again,'' said
Piniella of his first baseman who has been struggling since missing
four games earlier this month because of a knee injury.
</P>
<P>
   Cora's sixth homer of the season extended his hitting streak to
13 games and he also contributed one of the best defensive plays in
the game _ robbing Bell of an RBI single after Justice led off with
a double.
</P>
<P>
   Although Justice advanced to third on the play, Moyer escaped
with a 4-2 lead when he snagged Sandy Alomar's line drive and
doubled Alomar off the base.
</P>
<P>
   Davis also made a dandy defensive play. He lunged two rows into
the seats to catch Justice's popup in the eighth inning.

AMERICA NEEDS A REALITY CHECK ABOUT `ANDRO' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Contractors have been hired, scaffolding is going up
and hammers are flying on the greatest rebuilding project since the
Marshall Plan: Rationalizations for Mark McGwire's drug use.
</P>
<P>
   Much the same rehab is going on for Bill Clinton's image. But
more Americans care about the home run record than the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   In one way, Clinton and McGwire are twins joined at the
headline. They are the two most talked-about icons in America at
the moment, for all the obvious reasons plus one more:
</P>
<P>
   Both were caught cheating on the job, and most people don't want
to hear about it.
</P>
<P>
   America doesn't want to know where Clinton puts parts of his
body or what McGwire puts in his body.
</P>
<P>
   Most of us are so eager to believe the best in those who have
done well by us that we don't want to hear they cheated.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire has labored nobly on the edge of sports' most glamorous
record for more than a decade. He donates his time to children's
causes, can cry a big man's tears and is as close to Superman as we
get without finding a spaceship from Krypton.
</P>
<P>
   Whether you like or despise Clinton, the president is always the
personalized reflection of the nation's good times and bad times,
and we are in the midst of relative prosperity and peace.
</P>
<P>
   For the president and the slugger, most people just want
everything to be OK. We don't want the truth, we want reassurance.
This obsessive craving is why Disneyland works: We're perpetually
on a hunt for a world made false by eliminating reality.
</P>
<P>
   A distaste for truth is understandable, but that doesn't mean it
can't be dealt with in a way that doesn't destroy or condemn
everything attached to it.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of McGwire, his use of a testosterone-generating
substance called androstenedione does not reduce him and his
achievements to a mere freak of pharmacy. No drug is available that
will give a hitter the reflexes, timing and guts to hit a Randy
Johnson fastball 500 feet.
</P>
<P>
   But according to anecdotal evidence of some trainers and
athletes, andro may give him the strength to turn a 340-foot fly
out into a 350-foot home run.
</P>
<P>
   It's curious that McGwire claims to have begun using andro about
a year ago, about the time he fell three homers short of the
record. Apparently, McGwire decided the record was worth the
potential jeopardy to his health, because the 1998 season and its
expansion-diluted pitching might be his last good shot.
</P>
<P>
   His long history of injury, coupled with the fact that he is the
oldest player to challenge Roger Maris' mark, has made the
temptation irresistible to indulge andro, a legal, over-the-counter
substance, because the medical evidence does not yet scream in neon
letters about side effects or long-term consequences.
</P>
<P>
   He can find a number of athletes, trainers and doctors who will
support his conclusion that his regulated consumption is safe. Just
as a similar number of medical professionals can be found who will
say that conclusion isn't possible yet, as well as those who will
testify that andro's two primary uses are to mask detection of
steroids, as East German athletes did for years, and serve as a
sexual stimulant.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the facts, McGwire's tacit endorsement of andro will
cause instant over-consumption by those least able to draw
distinctions and make judgments.
</P>
<P>
   ``This entire episode has been one great big advertisement for
the drugs,'' Charles Yesalis, professor of human and performance
development at Penn State and author of ``The Steroids Game,'' told
The New York Times. ``You're going to have all kinds of kids
running out to the malls to buy it. Regardless of what the
Cardinals may say, andro is one honest-to-God sex steroid. This is
not vitamin C.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that baseball hasn't banned it is no surprise, given
the time warp in which the game exists. The sport has no rules on
performance enhancers. Can't wait to see the expression on
commissioner Bud Selig's face when he finds out teams no longer
travel to games by train.
</P>
<P>
   To limit the potential damage, what McGwire needs is full
disclosure, however difficult it may be.
</P>
<P>
   Use of performance enhancers is a huge international sports
issue, but largely ignored in the U.S. because we don't much care
about the sports where drugs are rife, such as track, swimming and
cycling.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire's acknowledgment opens the door for a national
discussion on what constitutes acceptable and unacceptable drugs;
which substances are therapeutic and which enhance performance.
</P>
<P>
   As was written here about EPO, another naturally produced
hormone whose abuse scandalized the Tour de France, it's time to
consider separate classes of competition, open and pure, because
crooks are so far ahead of cops.
</P>
<P>
   As disappointing and disillusioning as it was to see McGwire's
lack of trust in his own natural abilities, he has a chance to
regain the trust of those who still think honesty is a worthwhile
thing.
</P>
<P>
   He, the Cardinals and baseball can take the lead in being open
about use of andro and any other history of performance enhancing
substances, knowing McGwire's previous goodwill will create a fair
response from the sports public.
</P>
<P>
   Or, they can continue the national trend of running away from
the truth.

HOUSTON, WE HAVE LIFTOFF  
 MERCURY SENDS A MESSAGE TO DEFENDING CHAMPIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF METCALFE  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   No one raced to Andrea Kuklova's locker after the Mercury put
the WNBA defending champion Houston Comets on the brink of
elimination Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   There were too many second-half heroes to mob, especially
Jennifer Gillom, who transformed her block with 33.4 seconds left
at one end into a determined layup at the other at 8.9 to beat the
Comets, 54-51, in the only Phoenix home game of the best-of-three
finals.
</P>
<P>
   But the 13,634 X-factors at America West Arena would have had
little to cheer down the stretch if it hadn't been for Kuklova, the
nearly forgotten Slovakian guard whose first-half poise kept
Houston from pushing the cold-shooting Mercury into the ropes for
the rest of the night.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing 16-8, with two fouls apiece on defensive keys Umeki
Webb and Michelle Griffiths and shooting just 26.7 percent from the
field, Phoenix (22-12) was at risk of handing the opener to the
Comets' Big Three.
</P>
<P>
   But like two days earlier in Cleveland, when Cheryl Miller
snagged 6-foot-8 Maria Stepanova off the bench for nine critical
minutes that put away the semifinal tiebreaker, the 6-foot Kuklova
came up just as big.
</P>
<P>
   Her line _ two points, three assists and a block in 11:42 _
cannot adequately explain the difference she made in sending the
Mercury into the locker room with an uplifting 33-29 lead. The
Mercury was the first team to beat Houston (29-4) twice this
season.
</P>
<P>
   The scene shifts to the Compaq Center for Game 2 at 1 p.m.
Saturday and, if necessary, Game 3 on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a firm believer there are horses for courses,'' said
Mercury point guard Michele Timms. ``It's been a real experiment
for the coaching staff, finding the right games to play Maria, Dre
(Kuklova) and Kristi (Harrower). There have been games where they
haven't had much court time, but there have been games where they
have and have come on and done really well.
</P>
<P>
   ``And you know what, she's an international player and a great
player. She's been in finals before. Looking at our team, I
wouldn't have worried if I was the coaching staff because we have a
heck of a lot of experience. And Dre's been in big games before
with her national team, her French team and her Slovakian team. She
played with a lot of poise and a lot of confidence, which is tough
when you've been sitting out.''
</P>
<P>
   Kuklova has only reached double-figure minutes in one of the 10
previous games. But she kept Sheryl Swoopes in check when defensive
assignments were shuffled because of the fouls, and Swoopes never
found her range. She went 3-for-14.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very important game and I played well,'' Kuklova said
through her French interpreter. ``It's hard not to play for a few
games then to come out and do well against a big team like Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played good defense and on offense I didn't force anything
and took my time. It was good for the team because it was kind of
so-so then we started looking for the best shot.''
</P>
<P>
   As is typical of championship basketball, defense prevailed and
neither team achieved 35 percent shooting from the field.
</P>
<P>
   Two-time WNBA most valuable player Cynthia Cooper was seven
above her league-leading average with 29 points, but the other
parts of the all-league trio (Swoopes and Tina Thompson) combined
for 12. Gillom was the only other player to reach double-figure
scoring and her 15 points were five below her average in what for
the MVP runner-up rates as an off night.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-3 center got a hand on the forced shot by 5-5 Kim Perrot
as the shot clock ran down on Houston inside the final minute with
the game tied at 51. The rejection went to Timms, who called a
20-second timeout as the Mercury shifted into a now well-polished
routine of intelligent execution in critical situations.
</P>
<P>
   Stalling until 17 seconds (14 on the shot clock) remained, Timms
started a play that was not intended for Gillom, the queen of
buzzer beaters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was supposed to be used as a decoy,'' she said, the idea
being to work the ball side to side and catch the Comets
overguarding Gillom. ``The ball ended up in my hands, and I saw
Michele (Timms) on the wing open.''
</P>
<P>
   But the 34-year-old also knew she was one-on-one down low and
beat the 23-year-old Thompson to the basket before Cooper could
help.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper's one-handed three-point heave at the buzzer came
respectably close but could not avert the prediction of her former
USC college teammate, Miller _ who foresaw a Mercury win _ from
coming true.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix did play Houston here again, as Miller promised after a
three-point loss JulyT21 to the Comets, and did reverse the
outcome. But unlike the winner-take-all, one-game format of 1997,
that doesn't win a title. &QL;

FOX PLAYS HIS 6TH POSITION  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB COHN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For Andy Fox, it's six down and three to go.
</P>
<P>
   Fox started in center field against Milwaukee on Thursday night,
the sixth different position he has played this season. Devon White
was a late scratch because of back spasms.
</P>
<P>
   Fox logged a few innings in center during spring training, but
had not played there in a real game since last year, in the minors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's another place that Andy gives us an option,'' Manager
Buck Showalter said.
</P>
<P>
   Fox said it wasn't a big change from the corner outfield
positions. One good thing is that the ball doesn't slice as much.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's that much of a difference,'' he said.
``You've got more room to cover, but a fly ball is a fly ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox has mainly been the Diamondbacks' second baseman, but he
also has played left field, right field, first base and third base.
That leaves pitcher and catcher _ which he never has played _ and
shortstop, where Fox has seen considerable action in the past.
Would he like to play all nine positions before the season ends?
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be kind of neat, but I don't think it's gonna
happen,'' he said, citing the ``horror story'' of Jose Canseco
pitching (he hurt his arm) and the possibility of injury as a
catcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be nice, but it wouldn't ruin the season if I didn't
do it,'' said Fox, who has pushed his batting average to near the
.300 mark. ``I don't want to make a mockery of the game.'' &QL;  &QL; 
High marks &QL;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks Class-A affiliate in the California League,
High Desert, reaped some major awards Thursday. Right-hander Brad
Penny was named Most Valuable Player and Pitcher of the Year. It's
the first time since 1980 and the second time since 1960 a pitcher
was named MVP. And Don Wakamatsu, a former Arizona State catcher,
was named Manager of the Year. &QL;  &QL; 
Bean counting &QL;  &QL; 
After three straight home crowds of fewer than 40,000, Thursday's
attendance was announced as 40,856 even though a lot of green seats
were showing. Perhaps one reason was that some people reportedly
bought multiple tickets to stock up on Beanie Babies being given
away (Sly, the fox, with a card of authenticity autographed by
Andy). &QL;  &QL; 
Pretty cheesy &QL;  &QL; 
Is there any doubt who rules the Land of the Cheeseheads? The
Brewers' game against the Diamondbacks tonight was bumped from the
club's regular radio station to another station for a Green Bay
Packers preseason game.
</P>
<P>
   Also, with the tying run on third base for the Diamondbacks in
Thursday's game, the Fox Network cut away to catch up with Sammy
Sosa's home run chase. Batting in the eighth inning at Colorado's
Coors Field, the Chicago Cubs' slugger flied out. &QL;  &QL;

FEUDING WIDOWS OF '50s STAR KEEP THE BEAT GOING IN `FOOLS' 
 
By JEFF MILLAR 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some ideas for movies are just so rip-roaring,
makes-perfect-sense good that the inertia of the conception runs
all through the execution, spackling over bigger errors than it
should. ``Why Do Fools Fall in Love'' is based upon something just
irresistible.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-'80s, three women in their late 40s presented
themselves in a New York City courtroom in the matter of Frankie
Lymon.
</P>
<P>
   If you are of a certain age, you will surely remember doo-wop,
that subgenus of rhythm and blues; you might remember the
Teenagers, the group Lymon fronted; you will probably remember
their big hit _ ``Why Do Fools Fall in Love'' _ which Lymon
co-wrote, because it's a great song.
</P>
<P>
   But if you ever heard Lymon sing ``Why Do Fools Fall in Love''
there is no chance of forgetting that. His voice hadn't changed
when he recorded it, in 1955. If you could tear a half-inch-thick
pane of glass, that's what Lymon's voice sounded like on ``Why Do
Fools Fall in Love.`` It made Michael Jackson sound like James Earl
Jones.
</P>
<P>
   He was in the first wave of R&AMP;B artists who got suburban
teen-agers sprinting across the color line to the Alan Freed stage
shows. For a while, it was very good. But the Teenagers dissolved,
he went solo, his voice broke, he took to heroin, the gigs stopped
coming. By age 25, he was a nostalgia act, when he worked at all.
In 1968, an overdose sent him to rock 'n' roll heaven.
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, Diana Ross covered ``Fools'' beginning a process that
led to the courtroom. Each of the women claimed Frankie's cut of
the royalties, because each believed herself to be his widow _
widows Nos. 1, 2 and 3, as the bemused judge calls them in order of
(alleged) nuptials. This matter could have been cleared up more
simply if Frankie had divorced any of them, but he didn't. Frankie
wasn't a details guy.
</P>
<P>
   No. 1 is Elizabeth Waters (Vivica A. Fox), recently released
from a Pennsylvania prison after one of several convictions for
theft. She says she was married to Frankie in 1964, when he was
living in New York, then tumbling down the professional ladder and
deep into dope. She said she turned tricks to support them.
</P>
<P>
   No. 2 is Zola Taylor (Halle Berry), who was the female of the
doo-wop heavyweights The Platters (``Only You,'' ``My Prayer'').
She says she was married to Frankie when she lived in Los Angeles
in 1965. She helped get him a few gigs; and when she was off on a
four-month tour, Frankie spent every dime Zola had saved and
trashed her house.
</P>
<P>
   No. 3 is Emira Engle (Lela Rochon), a demure Georgia
schoolteacher, who said she was married to Frankie in 1967, met him
when he was stationed there in the Army. They had a big church
wedding. And although Frankie had moved out, ostensibly to restart
his career, she was still married to him when he died.
</P>
<P>
   The filmmakers find a good deal of the amusement in flashing
back from the witness stand to show each widow's version of
Frankie, ``Rashomon'' style. The homebody, gardening and
handy-with-a-hammer husband Emira describes is as plausible to
Widows Nos. 1 and 2 as one of those bugs from ``Starship
Troopers.''
</P>
<P>
   Still more amusing is the character work for show-biz-tough Zola
and the street-tough Elizabeth. They had their turf war over
Frankie while he was alive and don't like each other a bit. Berry
and Fox really light into this material. They're wonderful.
</P>
<P>
   Rochon is stalwart as the drabbie. As Frankie, Larenz Tate has
been dealt the worst hand at the table. As the direct object of the
``Roshamon'' gimmick, he's a big piece of wet clay being molded by
somebody else.
</P>
<P>
   Frankie's sketched almost entirely in the glyphs of
show-biz-movie cliches and the character given most of screenwriter
Tina Andrews' weakest dialogue. When an entertainer character looks
into the middle distance and begins a line with, ``When I'm out
there on that stage. ...'' I've learned to clap my hands over my
ears before the rest of the line can be delivered.
</P>
<P>
   Understand that this feints being a bio-pic of Frankie Lymon,
but it simply is not. It's about the three widows. Because the film
is not conceptualized to tell a linear nor even coherent story
about Lymon _ although you might find yourself wishing it were _
Tate just isn't allowed to work toward his own sense of what
Frankie is really like. Tate is an adequate actor, but this
assignment would have scared off an all-star team. He does a
first-rate job, though, of becoming Frankie onstage. He lip-synchs
the original Lymon recordings and is agile in the synchronized
group moves, as vital to doo-wop as the bass who goes, ``Oom Bopa
Doom Bopa Doom Bopa Doo Dut.''
</P>
<P>
   But I'll tell you, when director Gregory Nava, who also did
``Selena,'' is really getting into the doo-wop life, up there with
Little Richard (as himself, and a stitch) on the Alan Freed stage
show tours, lots more than I was actually prepared to forgive was
suddenly forgiven.
</P>
<P>
   Fun movie. Watch that R rating. Did I say Elizabeth and Zola
were tough? They're tough, baby.
</P>

2. TO COMBAT TERRORISTS, U.S. RAIDS REQUIRE COMMANDO UNITS,
</P>
<P>
   NOT CRUISE MISSILES, RANAN LURIE SAYS Ranan Lurie, who is known
internationally as a political cartoonist and analyst, was a
celebrated Israeli army combat major in the Six Day War. He
addresses the strategy chosen by the United States to enter into
what President Clinton is now calling ``a long, ongoing struggle
between freedom and fanaticism, between the rule of law and
terrorism.'' To Lurie, it takes hand-to-hand, gutsy commando action
to bring down terrorists, and the idea of firing Tomahawk missiles
at a training camp buried in the mountains is an expensive way of
``saying something you don't really mean.'' Interview by Carolee
Morrison. 1,500 words.

3. STUDIES LIKELY TO FUEL DEBATE OVER ANIMAL ORGAN TRANSPLANTS
Researchers are trying to find ways to transplant animal organs
into humans (xenotransplantation,) but there is a danger that
animal tissues are infected with pathogens which, though harmless
to animals, could cause serious diseases in humans. By Michael
McCarthy. Lancet News Service. 1,000 words.
_________________________________________________________________
4. ``WAR ON TERRORISM'' CAN DRIVE YOU BONKERS In what has become
the manner of the times, the newly proclaimed ``war on terrorism''
is taking on a shrill, hyper-menacing tone that cannot help the
U.S. deal with the problem. Some commentators seem almost gleeful
at finding a dangerous new enemy to take the place of the Cold War
threat. It is as though nothing else is going on in the world
except Monica Lewinsky and terrorism. By Flora Lewis. 800 words.
_________________________________________________________________
5. KIDS WHO CAN'T SAY GOODBYE Some children have difficulty with
transitions because they think that all their fun is being removed
- and that they'll never have a good time again. Margaret D. Rosin
gives sound advice on what to say and do to help children move
along. From Child magazine. 1,200 words.

6. WHAT'S DOING IN CASABLANCA Casablanca, the biggest city and main
port of Morocco, is intensely romantic - faded, languid and vaguely
decadent. Tips on events, sightseeing, hotels and restaurants. By
Joseph B. Treaster. NYT Way To Go! 1,800 words + photos + map.
_________________________________________________________________
7. MEDICAL BREAKTHROUGHS YOU CAN TOUCH The health-and-fitness world
of the future is now on display in Disneyland's new
``Innoventions'' exhibit, which provides hands-on fun for adults
and children. The exhibit combines Disney's storytelling abilities
with the expertise of other companies to demonstrate the hottest
developments in technology (e.g. a 10-foot-high interactive human
heart: when you put your hand on the heart, you can hear your own
heartbeat.) By Kathy Sena. From California Health magazine. 700
words + photos.
_________________________________________________________________
8. MAKE YOUR SHOPPING 'ROBOT' SEARCH THE NET So far, shopping
robots have been fairly primitive. The category's ancestor,
Andersen Consultant's Bargain Finder, searches 10 on-line stores
for the price of a compact disk and displays the results on a
single page. Now two young Germans have gone a step further toward
a ``smarter'' shopping agent. By Bruno Giussani. From New York
Times CyberTimes. 1,100 words.
_________________________________________________________________
9. ``SUFFERING CAMPS'' FOR OBESE CHINESE CHILDREN One effect of the
general rise in the standard of living in China and, above all, of
the government's ``single child'' policy, which encourages parents
to give in to their child's slightest whim, has resulted in martial
establishments known as ``suffering camps'' for overweight
children. By Frederic Bobin. From Le Monde. 600 words. (English
translation available.)
________________________________________________________________
10. JET-AGE BEDOUINS Home isn't what it used to be. These days we
may live on planes, in fast-food shops and hotel lobbies. Many
people don't actually have a place of their own but simply shuttle
back and forth. More and more of us are going tribal - living in
the crevices between cultures like jet-age Bedouins, in homes as
mobile as our spirits ..... By Pico Iyer. Wired magazine. 1,000
words.

BLEACH SOLUTION REMOVES MOLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. A maple dining set has a bad case of mold after sitting in a
damp cellar this summer. Is there any way to remove it without
harming the finish? Or is it necessary to have all pieces
refinished professionally. I would like to clean it myself.
</P>
<P>
   ELLIE CRONIN, Melrose, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. There is no need for refinishing, professionally or by you.
Indeed you can remove the mold or mildew yourself without harming
the finish. Make a mix of 1 part bleach and 3 parts water, and
paint this on the areas where you see or suspect mold. The solution
will kill the mold and remove it. And, it would not hurt the
furniture to apply the solution to all finished and unfinished
surfaces.
</P>
<P>
   After this treatment, get the pieces out of the cellar, or
ventilate the cellar by opening windows. You want to keep the
furniture dry; as it is, water vapor is condensing on the furniture
and growing mold.
</P>
<P>
   Another thing you might try is Lysol disinfectant spray, which
claims to fight mildew and also tends to be a drying agent,
reducing moisture on which mildew thrives. I'm going to check that
out, but I think the contents are mostly alcohol, which is a drying
agent. Alcohol also might kill mildew, but that's something I'm
going to find out for myself.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am having a new roof put on my Cape-style house. Will a
ridge vent be useful without soffit vents?
</P>
<P>
   VICTOR BANEVICIUS, Westborough, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes, the handyman thinks a ridge vent is useful under any
circumstances, and the time is perfect for installing it when a new
roof is going on.
</P>
<P>
   While a ridge vent is useful no matter what _ bringing old air
out and new air in, or pulling air out of the attic if there are no
soffit vents _ some vent manufacturers say a ridge vent must be
used in conjunction with soffit vents. The handyman agrees with
this, except to say that a ridge vent works better with soffit
vents than without.
</P>
<P>
   The best soffit vent is a continuous 2-inch-wide louvered strip
the full length of the soffit (the horizontal underpart of the roof
overhang). Anything less is inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   Suppose you have no soffit or overhang? Then live with it, or
have eave vents installed. To install eave vents, cut an inch or
more off the top of the fascia board to allow the ventilation, then
install the eave vent, which is essentially a ventilated drip edge,
installed over the existing drip edge.
</P>
<P>
   If you have gutters, you may have to relocate them to
accommodate the new vents.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Glue of some kind was spilled on my Formica counter, leaving
a little raised area. How can I remove it? The top is white, and
the stain has a grayish tone.
</P>
<P>
   SHIRLEY SLATER, Brewster, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. What you can use to remove the glue depends on what the glue
is. If it is Super Glue, try Super Glue Remover, sold, obviously,
where Super Glue is sold. Or, fingernail polish remover containing
acetone. Try an obscure area first to make sure whatever you use
does not affect the plastic. If it is Elmer's glue or anything
similar to white or yellow glue, water should dissolve it.
</P>
<P>
   A last resort is emory cloth, or very fine sandpaper used with
water. Go very lightly. The emory cloth or sandpaper will abrade
the glue and the water will help prevent scratching. If after
sanding there is a dull spot, you can polish the top with furniture
polish.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I plan to remove the insulation between the rafters in my
attic, and put insulation in the attic floor. There are floorboards
in the attic; I plan to blow in granulated insulation under the
floorboards. Will that work?
</P>
<P>
   DAVID JERISON, Belmont, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Taking the insulation from between the rafters (the sloping
beams holding up the roof) is a good idea because it is doing
little good there; heat is being lost through the floor and is
being stored in the attic; in other words you are heating the attic
for no good purpose. And that goes doubly if the attic is
ventilated.
</P>
<P>
   Blowing insulation under the floorboards is good, but be sure
that no insulation gets into the eaves (the underpart of the roof
overhang). Insulation in the eaves could cause condensation of
water vapor into water, a serious problem in an attic. It also
could cover any soffit vents (the soffit being the horizontal
underside of the eave), and that is not good.
</P>
<P>
   To prevent this, install baffles at the ends of the joists where
they form the eaves. Better yet, bite the bullet, pick up the
floorboards (no easy task admittedly), and install fiberglass
batts, or rolls, with the paper backing (a vapor barrier) against
the ceiling below. The vapor barrier is important in keeping heat
in the house where it belongs. Insulation by itself, while
important, is not enough.
</P>
<P>
   Then put the floorboards back. Sure it's a lot of work, but the
job will be done right.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>

 &HT;    REVIEW: Uproarious 'Rage' mocks the writer's life
 &HT;    By Scott Eyman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   OUT OF SHEER RAGE: Wrestling with D.H. Lawrence, By Geoff Dyer,
North Point; 241 pages; $22
</P>
<P>
   For most of its length, Out of Sheer Rage is a book about how
Geoff Dyer cannot bring himself to write a book, specifically a
book about D.H. Lawrence, the writer who made him want to become a
writer. That's a terrible thing to do to anyone, and Out of Sheer
Rage is Dyer's revenge.
</P>
<P>
   It's a hilarious, viciously ill-tempered screed, reeking of more
or less justified self-loathing, reading as if it was written on
the razored edge between a speed trip and utter despair, as if the
author was the result of some unholy one-night stand between Hunter
Thompson and Dorothy Parker.
</P>
<P>
   The initial idea is that if Dyer can focus on writing a sober
study of Lawrence, it might enable him to pull his life together.
Instead, his failure to write the book only accelerates the chaos,
which in turn forces him to slaughter his own literary child before
it can achieve maturity.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, as Dyer notes, the book on Lawrence is a way of
evading the book he really wants to write, a novel. ``I went from
not working on my book about Lawrence to not working on the novel
because all of this to-ing and fro-ing and note-taking actually
meant that I never did any work on either book.''
</P>
<P>
   Everywhere Dyer looks, something happens to stimulate the fury
he thought was exhausted. Dyer and his girlfriend, a long-suffering
creature named Laura - her motto for their relationship is
``Together Forever''; his is ``Together Whenever'' - go for a moped
ride. The cycle crashes, whereupon Dyer develops a pain in his neck
that forces him to keep a hand under his chin for support.
</P>
<P>
   ``To everyone else ... it looked like I was deep in thought,
wrestling with philosophical problems, when all I was doing was
trying to bear the awful weight of my head - which, on reflection,
is what all philosophical thought comes down to anyway: how to bear
the awful weight of your head.''
</P>
<P>
   He tries reading recent criticism of Lawrence, and the turgid
post-structuralist prose only increases his roiling frustration:
``How could these people with no feeling for literature have ended
up teaching it, writing about it? ... Writing like that kills
everything it touches. Walk around a university campus and there is
an almost palpable smell of death about the place because hundreds
of academics are busy killing everything they touch.''
</P>
<P>
   He concludes this outburst, which would have fit splendidly in
the mouth of Network's Howard Beale, with, ``How can you know
anything about literature if all you've done is read books?''
</P>
<P>
   In a desperate attempt to jump-start his book, Dyer and his
girlfriend go on a disastrous odyssey that retraces Lawrence's
footsteps from Eastwood, England, his hometown (which now features
a blue line that leads you on a self-guided tour of Lawrence
sites), to Mexico, to Taos, New Mexico. In all these places, Dyer
encounters bad food, vile inhabitants and spontaneous explosions of
eczema.
</P>
<P>
   At first, I thought Geoff Dyer had written a hilarious novel in
the form of nonfiction, a successor to A Fan's Notes or My Search
for Warren Harding. But, hidden in the thickets of misanthropy is
some serious critical writing about Lawrence. It's perfectly
intelligent criticism, but it pales in originality next to Dyer's
take on his own life. Besides, at this late date, I'd rather
countenance root canal than read about The Plumed Serpent.
</P>
<P>
   Between the lines of Dyer's neurasthenia is a trenchant
self-portrait of the writer as doomed misfit. Musing on the subject
of children, whom he regards largely as virulent carriers of
influenza, Dyer writes that ``children are so convenient: you have
children because you're struggling to get by as an artist ... or
failing to get by with your career. Then you can persuade yourself
that your children prevented you from having this career that had
never looked like working out. So it goes on: Things are always
forsaken in the name of an obligation to someone else, never as a
failing, a falling short of yourself. Before you know it, desire
has atrophied to the degree that it can only make itself apparent
by passing itself off as an obligation.''
</P>
<P>
   Out of Sheer Rage is as perfect a picture of the Writer as Jerk
as the Coen brothers' Barton Fink or Woody Allen's Deconstructing
Harry - exposure to which is mandatory, cautionary viewing for
anyone foolish enough to want to be a writer, or self-destructive
enough to want to live with a writer, but more or less
incomprehensible to those unfamiliar with the dismal trade.
</P>
<P>
   There may be better books published in 1998, and there assuredly
will be more serious books published in 1998, but the utter
originality of Out of Sheer Rage makes it unlikely to be exceeded
for sheer pleasure.

   BLIND _ Lori Hardy gave birth to her first child hoping, like
any other mother, for just a normal, healthy baby. She had no
reason to expect complications. But when Tyler Hardy was born three
years ago, doctors told her matter of factly that he had no eyes.
The Hardys were changed by the realization that their child would
not have a normal life, and that theirs would never be completely
normal again either. Through the Center for the Visually Impaired,
the couple, who live in Canton, are learning that blindness and
visual impairment are challenges to be met squarely, not shrunk
from. (Skube, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 56. WITH PHOTOS.

   GARDENMUSEUM _ LONDON _ It's a gardener's treasure chest _ a
17th-century watering can, shovels more than 100 years old, an
1800s wheelbarrow, even a Victorian cucumber straightener _ and the
goods aren't even outdoors. They're in church. Avid gardeners would
agree that's the perfect sanctuary for worshipping 300 years of
tools that have made their work easier. But the 17th-century church
east of London's embankment is an even more appropriate home for
the Museum of Garden History _ the only collection of its kind in
the world _ because of its own legacy. Its churchyard contains the
tomb of two famed plantsmen, a bit of history that prompted
Rosemary Nicholson and her late husband, John, to open the museum
in the first place. ``People thought we were absolutely mad,'' she
says of their struggle 20 years ago to convert the dilapidated
church and graveyard into an exhibition space and repository for
rare plants. ``They would ask, 'Garden history? What's that? What
do we need to know about it?' `` Apparently lots, as Americans'
passion for gardening reaches levels rivaling that of the British.
``Look at how many people are doing it. It's become such a pasttime

 &HT;    COLUMN: You may have a valuable meteorite and not know it
 &HT;    By Frank Cerabino
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I don't want you to think I'm a nut,'' the man said.
</P>
<P>
   Then he told me about the grapefruit-size meteorite that left a
crater in the back yard of his Acreage home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went out to feed the ducks when I saw it,'' Rick Daddea
said.
</P>
<P>
   So I went to see Daddea, the rock and the alleged crater at the
edge of his backyard duck pond.
</P>
<P>
   By the time I got to Daddea's secluded Acreage home, his
thinking on the rock had evolved from talking about ``donating it
to the Smithsonian'' to ``selling it to the highest bidder.''
</P>
<P>
   It's one of the reasons scientists are squeamish when talking
about meteorites.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been burned before with meteorites,'' said Dr. Jack
Horkheimer, director of the Miami Space Transit Planetarium.
``There are so many things that can mimic a meteorite. And there
are people who do it for hoaxes.''
</P>
<P>
   Daddea says he thinks he has the real thing. That's why he took
the dense, dark rock on Wednesday to the South Florida Science
Museum in West Palm Beach, where planetarium director Erich
Landstrom chipped off a piece of it to send to the Smithsonian for
analysis.
</P>
<P>
   Landstrom doesn't have anything to say about the alleged
meteorite until the results come back in about a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get people every day telling me they've found a meteorite,''
said Eric Twelker, a lawyer in Juneau, Alaska, who owns an on-line
meteorite sales business called The Meteorite Market. ``One guy's
been pushing a piece of limestone on me for years.''
</P>
<P>
   Twelker buys and sells meteorites around the world. He has an
inventory of about 500 meteorite chunks for sale and thousands of
what he describes as ``little bitty things.''
</P>
<P>
   Meteorites are priced by the gram, and a 5-pound rock, something
about the size of Daddea's find, could fetch thousands of dollars
from a collector, Twelker said.
</P>
<P>
   Some meteorites are more significant than others. Most of them
come from the asteroid belt between Jupiter and Mars. When these
asteroid chunks collide during their orbits, they break apart and
Jupiter's gravitational power flings them into elliptical
trajectories that cross Earth's path.
</P>
<P>
   But others are actually wayward pieces of our moon or other
planets. A meteorite from Mars, a rarity, goes for about $2,000 per
gram, Twelker said. (There are about 457 grams per pound.)
</P>
<P>
   One piece, weighing about a hundredth of an ounce, sold at
auction this year for $4,600.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our Earth receives at least 10 tons of meteoric dust every
day,'' Horkheimer said.
</P>
<P>
   Entry into the Earth's atmosphere burns up most of the
meteorites, turning them into flashes in the night sky but nothing
big enough to make an impact on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   But a small number of meteorite chunks do manage to survive the
scorching trip through our planet's atmosphere. The biggest of all
is a 60-ton meteorite that landed in Namibia. America's biggest
meteorite struck in Willamette, Ore., and weighed 14 tons.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, a 27-pound meteorite demolished a car parked in
a driveway in Peekskill, N.Y. And this year, seven boys playing
basketball in Monahans, Texas, were surprised when a meteorite ball
landed near their court.
</P>
<P>
   That meteorite, which weighed less than three pounds, was sold
at auction last month to a collector for $23,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are real meteorites,'' Twelker said, ``and they do
fall.''
</P>
<P>
   But he sees a lot of so-called meteorites that don't end up
being out of this world.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think that unusual rocks are meteorites, and that's
generally not the case,'' he said. ``I recently had a guy who
brought a musket ball to my attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Daddea took an astronomy course in college, has a telescope at
his house and was recently in his back yard looking for meteorite
trails in the night sky.
</P>
<P>
   A meteorite the size of his rock might have created a sonic boom
and would have definitely landed in a ground-pounding fireball,
Twelker said.
</P>
<P>
   But Daddea didn't see or hear it land, he said. He said he
discovered it while walking to the edge of his duck pond one
morning and seeing the edge of the rock sticking out in the middle
of a circular, pothole-size indentation in the soft, sandy soil.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely a meteorite,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The rock does display some of the characteristics of a
meteorite.
</P>
<P>
   It attracts a magnet _ a vast majority of meteorites contain
iron.
</P>
<P>
   It has a dark rind on the outer surface, which appears to be
what's known as a fusion crust, a burned appearance created by the
entry into Earth's atmosphere. And it also has an irregular shape
marked by ``thumb prints,'' which the heat generated from entry
causes in meteorites.
</P>
<P>
   But scientists perform specialized tests on possible meteorites,
examining their crystal structure and pinpointing their composition
to rule out earthly copycats.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are things that are very difficult to fake,'' Twelker
said.
</P>
<P>
   So Daddea's waiting for the test results to come back and
starting to collect preliminary offers from collectors, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been getting offers of several thousands of dollars for
it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What about keeping it for yourself?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   Daddea said he'd have no use for a meteorite.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a rock,'' he said.

   The Advent's real pastor, the Rev. Dexter Kessler, was at All
Saint's Church in Laughton, in the south of England.
</P>
<P>
   He led worship in a church built in 1229, more than 700 years
before anyone thought of building the Church of the Advent.
</P>
<P>
   The clergymen swapped churches, homes and cars for August. Each
took his family and went abroad to the other's parish.
</P>
<P>
   That offered one the opportunity to visit the colonies, the
other to discover his roots. It is the first trip for each to the
other's country. Each had an unusual and inexpensive vacation, met
new friends and overcame some culture shock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is very big,'' said Farey, 42, reflecting on the
size of American cars, homes, roads, stores, stoves and
refrigerators. ``And it's very hot. But it's great to be here. The
wonderful thing that sets this apart is that we are living in
someone's home. We get to meet people in a way that you wouldn't if
you simply went as a tourist.''
</P>
<P>
   Farey is a priest of the Church of England and pastor of three
small churches in villages about an hour south of London. It is
common for English parsons to have responsibility for more than one
small congregation, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Farey is here with his wife, Pat, and their three children,
Christina, 9, Jonathan, 6, and Luke, 3.
</P>
<P>
   Kessler, 54, is pastor of Advent and a priest of the Episcopal
Church in America. The exchange is possible because the two
churches are historically and spiritually linked.
</P>
<P>
   The Episcopal church is the independent American expression of
the Church of England that began after the American Revolution. The
denominations have a kind of spiritual mother-daughter
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   The two clergy traded places for the month. Each pastor led
services on one Sunday (substitute clergy looked after the churches
for the remainder of the month). The rest of the pastors' time is
for holiday.
</P>
<P>
   The people of Advent have taken the Fareys into their hearts and
homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a wonderful thing,'' said Heidi McNabb, a vestry
member. ``We've adopted them. Now, they are part of our family.''
</P>
<P>
   Kessler and his wife, Cindy, have become part of another church
family. They are in a little village of several hundred people
where the roads are narrow, the pubs popular and there are more
sheep than people.
</P>
<P>
   In the village pubs _ Roebucks or The Green Man _ they are
welcomed ``not as tourists or Americans but as part of the local
community,'' Kessler said in a telephone interview from his August
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is fantastic,'' he said. ``I get up in the morning and
look out. I can't see a car. I can't hear an airplane. I hear
birds. Roses are everywhere. The people in the town have welcomed
us like members of the family.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea for the swap began through a little-known,
not-for-profit, one-man organization in Ontario, Canada, called the
Episcopal Clergy Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Christopher Davis, a priest of the Anglican Church of
Canada, is the third person to run the exchange since it began in
Pennsylvania in 1981, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He places a notice in church magazines, advertising the service.
English, Canadian and American Episcopal clergy interested in an
exchange submit information about their homes and churches and send
a $10 fee to Davis.
</P>
<P>
   He publishes a newsletter in February and April each year,
listing the interested clergy. The rest of the arrangements are up
to them, Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   Kessler and Farey were among 51 clergy in this year's
newsletter. They contacted each other to make the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I seldom hear about how many exchanges actually take place,''
Davis said. ``The only indication that the system is working is
that people keep applying.''
</P>
<P>
   Not every exchange includes the use of a car, Davis said. This
one did.
</P>
<P>
   The Kesslers traveled more than 1,200 miles in the first two
weeks in search of history, Dexter Kessler said. They crisscrossed
the country from Shakespeare's Stratford-on-Avon to Bath, Dover and
Canterbury.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like walking back into all the books you've read, the
English literature, English history, church history,'' Kessler
said. ``It's very moving to walk in the same footsteps that people
have walked for hundreds of years.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fareys have been traveling as well, discovering things
ancient and modern. A trip to Lake Okeechobee brought them, to
their wonder, face to face with an alligator. Disney World and the
Kennedy Space Center are on their agenda.
</P>
<P>
   They are delighted to be in America _ even if that means being
among an English-speaking people who do not understand their
language.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really God-smacked that we're here,'' said Pat Farey.
``It's a big adventure for us. God-smacked? You don't use that
expression? It means amazed.''

 &HT;    Memories of Studio 54
 &HT;    By Thom Smith
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   `If you were really into it, you won't remember'
</P>
<P>
   Society photographer Lucien Capehart:
</P>
<P>
   I used to have hourlong phone conversations with Steve Rubell
all the time and never met him. Why? I don't know why. He just
liked to talk to people.
</P>
<P>
   It was a lot of fun. Like a big movie theater. It still had a
lot of the theater seats in it. It was all black inside, a lot of
narrow passageways.
</P>
<P>
   One waiter I know in Palm Beach says if you were really into it,
you won't remember.
</P>
<P>
   `It seemed like it was never gonna stop'
</P>
<P>
   Artist Bruce Helander:
</P>
<P>
   The first time I went there, it was a juice bar, and it was
packed. They were serving fruit juice and nobody knew why. It
turned out Rubell had taken out a caterer's license, which is a
one-night deal, and was nabbed. He finally did get his liquor
license later on.
</P>
<P>
   It was the height of disco, and everybody was just happy to get
in the door. The B&AMP;T _ bridge and tunnel _ crowd, was so eager to
get in that they didn't complain. I had no problem because I was an
artist and Rubell wanted people who looked like we did. If you
looked right and strutted the right strut, that's what he was
looking for.
</P>
<P>
   Later on in the evenings, they couldn't close the cash registers
because they were overflowing with cash. Very few people left until
the wee hours of the morning. The great shocker was that the doors
would open and it was like a nuclear blast because it was complete
daylight. We had been dancing all night and didn't realize it.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Warhol would always be there. There was always a circle of
people around him. He had a big magic marker and Interview
magazines, and he would sign them across the top. His real purpose
was finding portrait candidates for the magazine. He definitely was
the king of the place. He was almost always there.
</P>
<P>
   The whole thing was lighting. The decor didn't matter because it
was kept dark and romantic and secretive. If you wanted to be seen,
you'd go to the bathroom _ that's where the lights were. It didn't
matter which, men and women were in both.
</P>
<P>
   It just seemed like it was never gonna stop.
</P>
<P>
   Roxanne Pulitzer: It was another world
</P>
<P>
   It was the place to go at the time. Herbert (husband Peter's
first name) and I pulled up in our limo, and we both looked at each
other because there was such a crowd. ...
</P>
<P>
   One big heavyset man pointed at us _ I don't know why _ and we
walked right in.
</P>
<P>
   It was the time of disco _ we stayed late, the people-watching
was great. ... Even back then they had the transvestites, men
together on the dance floor. ... You felt like you were in another
world.
</P>
<P>
   We had just been married a couple of years. I was a baby going
there. It was exciting that you could see so many celebrities _
Halston and Liza, Bianca Jagger, David Bowie, Warhol _ oddly
enough, he was with C.Z. Guest.
</P>
<P>
   It was dark, with lights on the dance floor. I couldn't even
describe the colors. It was red and black, I think, almost
bordello-ish in my mind. You could see every extreme _ lots of
beautiful people.

 &HT;    Ex-Studio 54 co-owner Ian Schrager still selling excitement
 &HT;    By Cheryl Blackerby
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The boyish grin and the chiseled good looks from the
days when he was co-owner of Studio 54 are still there.
</P>
<P>
   And the energy.
</P>
<P>
   Ian Schrager goes from 0 to 60 in 4 seconds _ his plans for a
new ``boutique'' line of hotels and his enthusiasm for his newly
acquired European hotels accelerating at a speed that would leave
button-down CEOs with their button-down market surveys smelling
rubber.
</P>
<P>
   Schrager looks hipper than a Gap ad in his collarless white
shirt rolled up above the elbows and wrinkled khaki pants. His new
offices overlooking the Hudson River are all monastic white,
serene, ultra-chic.
</P>
<P>
   A perfect contrast to his frenetic pace and colorful ideas.
</P>
<P>
   He is the largest hotel owner in New York, the mastermind behind
some of the world's most fashionable, and profitable, hotels
including Manhattan's trendiest trio, the Royalton, Morgans and the
Paramount, and Miami Beach's hottest ticket, the Delano.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, he will renovate the St. Moritz on Central Park South,
turning it into his luxurious flagship.
</P>
<P>
   Schrager's genius is his combination of business savvy and
creativity _ and his nose for cutting-edge trends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like this reconciliation of art and commerce,'' he said.
``You can do both. You can do something that's very financially
successful and something special.''
</P>
<P>
   But few do, especially in the hotel industry, where a room is a
room is a room, and the most you can hope for is a plaid sofa and
HBO.
</P>
<P>
   At Schrager's hotels, though, the rooms are, well, different.
</P>
<P>
   There are the Alice-in-Wonderland chairs with high backs that
would easily accommodate Shaquille O'Neal, beds jutting out of
6-foot-high silk-screened Jan Vermeer paintings with gilted frames,
and bathroom sinks that look like stainless steel ice cream cones.
</P>
<P>
   Guests are shocked, and delighted. And they keep coming.
</P>
<P>
   He gives them what they crave _ excitement, drama and art for a
price that the hip, but not necessarily the wealthy, can afford.
(Paramount rates start at $135.)
</P>
<P>
   Schrager does have his detractors. Hotelier Donald Trump told
The New York Times that Schrager ``puts linoleum in the bathrooms
and gets people to pay a high price.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if he was making a compliment to me,'' said
Schrager, laughing. ``I sent Donald a roll of linoleum because we
don't have any linoleum in the bathrooms.''
</P>
<P>
   What he does have is a psychic ability to predict what people
want.
</P>
<P>
   How does a person go about creating a Paramount or a Royalton?
</P>
<P>
   ``Vision,'' he said, without hesitation, ``a certain idea, a
passion, enthusiasm, a certain desire to do something different.''
</P>
<P>
   And hard work.
</P>
<P>
   ``It evolves through attrition,'' he said. ``You leave no stone
unturned. You give everything you have to it, no detail goes
unnoticed. Then at the end of the day it all miraculously comes
together and the sum of the parts is more than the individuals.
It's like a painting.''
</P>
<P>
   The hotel industry, he said, has been organized around either
great service _ the Ritz Carlton is an example _ or great
execution, such as the Marriott, but not innovation.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was my opportunity and my niche,'' he said. ``Sameness
and predictability used to be considered a virtue. I don't think it
is a virtue. Holiday Inn used to say the best surprise is no
surprise. But I think there's nothing better than a good
surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   The hallways in his hotels are a little dark with dramatic neon
lighting. ``It's to prepare the person for the next act,'' he said,
with all seriousness.
</P>
<P>
   Hotels should be theater, high drama.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should a hotel be just a place to sleep? Why can't it be
fun?'' he asked. ``It was the same thing when I was in the
nightclub business. Why does a bathroom have to be just to relieve
the kidneys? Why can't there be some entertainment to bring a smile
to your face?''
</P>
<P>
   In the ladies' rest room at the Royalton, it's impossible to
find the entrances to the cubicles, which have mirrored doors.
There are no handles and no clues. You have to push the mirrors to
find out where the doors are.
</P>
<P>
   And people do smile, unless they're in a big hurry.
</P>
<P>
   He describes hotels not in terms of rooms and beds but ``the
whole package, the whole vibration, the whole visceral
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   As he expands his company, and he plans to buy five hotels each
year, will it be difficult to sustain the excitement? ``It really
doesn't worry me because it's the strength of the idea,'' he said
simply.
</P>
<P>
   Schrager knows ideas. Back in the '70s, he and college friend
Steve Rubell had an infamous one _ Studio 54, the hottest disco
ever, where a typical night would see Rubell schmoozing Mick
Jagger, Elizabeth Taylor, Liza Minnelli and Halston.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, as a new generation catches disco fever with the
movie ``54'' and new books on the nightclub, Schrager feels no
nostalgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have bittersweet memories about it,'' he said. ``This
tremendous amount of attention focused on that right now I find
very amusing. I didn't participate or cooperate with anybody having
anything to do with it because it doesn't bring anything good to me
and my life.''
</P>
<P>
   The disco days of the 1970s are in the distant past.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was like high school. I'm onto something else.''
</P>
<P>
   Hotels were the logical next step from nightclubs, he said,
because at both you're taking care of guests and keeping them
entertained. The transition turned out to be easy.
</P>
<P>
   No one is more amazed by his hotel success than he is. ``What
makes me so insecure is that I never lose the marvel that other
people also like it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But not everybody has to admire, or even understand it, only
those with an appreciation for high style, or at least those who
like to watch celebrities. Schrager doesn't care about the
convention crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because what we're doing is not institutional, 500 million
people don't have to like it. It allows me to try things that
haven't been done before.''
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics who said his hip hotels would have the shelf life of
his infamous nightclub (three years) are now asking him to create
hotels for them. He is talking to Starwood Hotels, owner of
Sheraton and other brands, about creating a line of special hotels.
</P>
<P>
   Many of his competitors are still trying to figure out how he
stays on top of the trends, a skill that an MBA can't give.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not intellectual, it's purely instinctive,'' he said,
without hesitation. ``What Steve and I did in nightclubs, that was
the kind of nightclub I wanted to go to. It was just a very
personal thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Schrager does stay in other people's hotels
occasionally, and he especially likes the Ritz in Paris and
Claridges in London, those are not the kind of places that capture
his imagination. He's not interested in history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want something that is modern and of the future, not
something retro, not something my parents would have liked. It's
not something I reject because they would have liked it, but, hey,
I'm my own person. It's my discovery.''
</P>
<P>
   Schrager is certain that other creative people work the same
way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure that Donna Karan and Calvin Klein and all the other
fashion designers design clothes that they like, that they
themselves would like to wear or would like to see on their
partners.''
</P>
<P>
   Ian Schrager did not set out to be a hotelier. He was a Jewish
kid from Brooklyn who played stickball in the streets and
eventually went to law school.
</P>
<P>
   The trip from Brooklyn to a sleek Manhattan office with the
white sofas and the white orchids on the coffee table, was a ride
in the fast lane, and it wasn't smooth.
</P>
<P>
   The bumps along the way included the closing of Studio 54 in
1979, a 13-month stay in a federal prison with Rubell for tax
evasion in 1980, and bankruptcy court in the early 1990s when his
prize assets, the Paramount and Royalton, were over-leveraged.
</P>
<P>
   The worst was going to jail. ``Steve said jail will humble
anybody,'' he recalled. ``The first day going in and having that
door slam on you _ that I still remember, the clanging of that
door.''
</P>
<P>
   And he missed more than a year of his life.
</P>
<P>
   But Schrager said he remembered something his father had taught
him: ``There's never any harm in falling down. What the harm is is
not dusting yourself off and picking yourself up and starting
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Schrager bought a modest hotel with Rubell after their prison
release and turned it into the sleek Morgans, an immediate
celebrity hangout.
</P>
<P>
   Rubell died in 1989 from hepatitis, and he didn't get to see the
Paramount.
</P>
<P>
   ``I miss my friend,'' Schrager said a year after it opened.
``It's not quite as much fun without Steve. We were like Spanky and
Our Gang. If he were here, he would be the one on the front line,
and I would be saying, `Steve, do the people like it?' ''
</P>
<P>
   But Schrager was the one on the front line, and he restructured
the Paramount and Royalton and proceeded to build an empire of 16
haute hotels in New York, California, Miami and soon-to-open hotels
in Paris and London.
</P>
<P>
   And the celebrities flock to them like they did to Studio 54.
The Delano Hotel is home to Madonna's restaurant, The Blue Door.
Gloria Estefan shot an album cover in the 150-foot-long swimming
pool.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, Schrager, 52, married Rita Narona, a
Cuban-American from Miami and former dancer with the New York City
Ballet, and has two daughters ages 4 and 8 months. The hotel
magnate is now changing diapers.
</P>
<P>
   So why is he still so driven when he has such extraordinary
financial and personal success?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's the fear of failure that pushes you. It's not the
race for the brass ring. If you're swimming, you have no choice but
to swim to the other side.''
</P>
<P>
   He has three goals for his hotel empire: to do five
one-of-a-kind hotels a year; to take one of his existing hotels,
such as the Royalton, and roll out a line of them (``They would all
be defined by the setting and the place, but still have the same
spirit''); and to create a ``boutique'' brand for a large hotel
company.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't do the Delano in every city in the country, but I
could do something that's more sophisticated, that has some
originality, that's out there on the edge,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He's also planning a merchandising business, primarily the
furniture, sheets and other items associated with Schrager Hotels.
</P>
<P>
   Will there be an Ian Schrager cologne?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not within my circle of competence,'' he said,
grinning. ``I won't go there. But sheets _ I probably know more
about sheets than anybody. Why not sell them?''

 &HT;    Plot of '54,' where are you?
 &HT;    By Hap Erstein
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you're after a metaphor for the dizzy, druggy, discoing 1970s
_ and is anyone really on that search? _ surely, New York's
infamous Studio 54 will do. The frenetic inner sanctum of the
Beautiful People and would-be celebrities was so lacking in
significance that it virtually defines the decade.
</P>
<P>
   The film industry's current fascination with the '70s (``Boogie
Nights,'' ``The Last Days of Disco'') gains another belt notch in
``54,'' which takes us behind those legendary, well-guarded doors
to find out what we missed. If it makes you feel any better, the
answer is ``Not much.''
</P>
<P>
   Give first-time feature director Mark Christopher (and
production designer Kevin Thompson) credit for visually evoking the
bacchanalian excess of former steakhouse magnate Steve Rubell's
playhouse. If it really was as depicted, Studio 54 was the ultimate
toga party, an Egyptian spectacle, a Felliniesque frolic and a
major consumer of confetti and glitter dust. Summing up the scene
is a suspended crescent man-in-the-moon, with a gilded spoon of
cocaine swinging towards his nose.
</P>
<P>
   Say what you will about disco music, but the movie's soundtrack
also captures the era well. If only Christopher's screenplay
weren't so painfully wooden and hokey, he might have something
here.
</P>
<P>
   Like ``Boogie Nights,'' it takes the viewpoint of a wide-eyed
innocent. He's Shane O'Shea, a 19-year-old, curly-haired New Jersey
hunk, staring across the river at Manhattan's skyline and yearning
to party at Studio 54. Picked out of the clamoring horde of
hopefuls on the sidewalk outside the club, Shane's looks gain him
entry to the pharmaceutical fantasyland, then gets him hired as a
beefcake busboy. Having caught the heavy-lidded eye of Rubell, he
soon rises to the coveted level of bartender.
</P>
<P>
   Shane's pals are club lackey Greg and his coat-checking wife
Anita (Salma Hayek), who yearns to be the next disco queen. Greg
eventually gets sticky fingers around the cash he hauls out to
bagmen, and Anita gets her shot at fame but is upstaged by an
overdose victim on the dance floor.
</P>
<P>
   After popping pills like dinner mints and playing sex toy to
such customers as a Bianca Jagger-ish Sela Ward, Shane connects
briefly with soap opera actress Julie Black (Neve Campbell). In one
of the movie's sillier scenes, these two Jersey transplants pause
from the glitter of Studio 54 and go on a bowling date like
comic-book teens Archie and Veronica.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher's script is remarkably free of irony or attitude
about the club scene. It does, however, take a dim view of Rubell,
seen almost exclusively through his drug habits, male employee
pawing and creative accounting methods. Yet ``Saturday Night Live''
alum Mike Myers knits these into a surprisingly effective and
affecting performance, even if he does look more and more like Jon
Lovitz as the movie progresses.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Phillippe has the vacant good looks and sweet naivete
required to play Shane. Director Christopher turns us into
celebrity voyeurs by salting the movie with cameo appearances from
the likes of Michael York and Lauren Hutton. The end credits
indicate whole scenes of other cameos that didn't make the final
cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``54'' does capture the sights and sounds of the '70s, at least
one specific, grimy corner of it. What it lacks is a story worth
caring about.

 &HT;    I'm older than all the pro ballplayers
 &HT;    By Gary Borders
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NACOGDOCHES, Texas _ I celebrated a birthday recently. Send no
presents, please. It's no big deal, though I am now older than
Elvis was when he died. Further, I do not believe there are any
active major-league baseball players older than me.
</P>
<P>
   The closest in age I could find in a cursory Internet search was
Paul Molitor with the Twins, who's 364 days younger than me.
</P>
<P>
   Same with football. Warren Moon, former Oilers quarterback now
with Seattle, is nearly 42, which means I have a 15-month head
start on him. I could find no other NFL players even in their 40s.
</P>
<P>
   Feel free to correct me. It would make me feel better. Since I
turned 30, my personal definition of officially entering middle age
would be when I was older than anybody playing major league
baseball or professional football.
</P>
<P>
   That time apparently has come, unless some sports trivia
know-it-all dredges up a third-string utility infielder resting on
the bench somewhere whose birthday precedes mine. I'm hopeful but
not terribly so.
</P>
<P>
   My birthday and the few days around it seem to be common dates.
A reporter here has the same birthday. A few years ago, I was
exactly twice as old as she _ an unpleasant realization on my part.
My daughter's birthday is the day after mine. My late grandfather's
birthday was yesterday. Apparently there were some very busy people
around Thanksgiving, including me, I suppose.
</P>
<P>
   I dislike not being an age that's divisible by five. I can't
remember how old I am when asked. When I was 30, 35, or 40, I
always knew my age. In between is tougher. I have to subtract the
year of my birth from the current year. I get in trouble when I
forget what the current year is. I'm told this is a common problem,
but I believe I am just being humored.
</P>
<P>
   I remember exactly where I was 20 years ago today, though. I was
in The Daily Sentinel building in downtown Nacogdoches. It was a
Thursday afternoon, and I had finished processing film when I got
the call. It's time, my then-wife, a few weeks overdue, said. We
headed to the hospital. I was excited. My first child would be born
on my birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, Kasey did not cooperate. Some 20 hours later, 11 hours too
late for my birthday, she arrived in Nacogdoches. For two decades
now, Kasey and I have celebrated our birthdays together. She's
grown now, in her third year of college. I spent my birthday eve
moving her into an apartment after two years in the dorm. She is
slowly learning about the real world. I'm paying the rent, of
course, and the college tuition, but she's paying utilities and car
insurance. There is light at the end of the parental tunnel. But
not much, with a trio of children to follow.
</P>
<P>
   My second daughter timed it better. She arrived dead in the
middle of the day on my father's birthday. Now she's 17 and
entering her last year of high school. In nine months, she too will
be at the University of Texas. How did all this happen so quickly?
</P>
<P>
   There are still children in the house, by marriage and not
blood, but mine full-time nonetheless. Most of the time they make
me feel younger, when I'm carrying the 9-year-old piggyback around
the yard, praying my back doesn't go out, or discussing the musical
merits of Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin with the 14-year-old punk
rocker.
</P>
<P>
   I don't feel middle-aged, though I'm told by all four children
that I look it. I'm blessed with an iron constitution to match my
skull. The few aches and pains are minor nuisances. I've had an
interesting life to this point, sometimes too interesting, what
with marriages, job changes, and such, but it's all worked out
somehow. As that great American Joe Walsh sang, ``Life's been good
to me so far.''
</P>
<P>
   I come from a long line of long-lived folks on both sides of the
family tree, so I plan on being around awhile, though I'm finally
old enough to understand I'm not invincible. And as humorist Bob
Murphey says: In the great scheme of things, if you want to know
how much you'll be missed once you're gone, stick your hand in a
bucket of water, then pull it out _ and see how much difference
you've made in the bucket. Now that's keeping it all in
perspective.
</P>
<P>
   Someone once told me that what really matters is who you loved
and who loved you. So I feel blessed to this point.
</P>
<P>
   I just wish I could find a 43-year-old major league ballplayer
on some team's roster.

   BLIND _ Lori Hardy gave birth to her first child hoping, like
any other mother, for just a normal, healthy baby. She had no
reason to expect complications. But when Tyler Hardy was born three
years ago, doctors told her matter of factly that he had no eyes.
The Hardys were changed by the realization that their child would
not have a normal life, and that theirs would never be completely
normal again either. Through the Center for the Visually Impaired,
the couple, who live in Canton, are learning that blindness and
visual impairment are challenges to be met squarely, not shrunk
from. (Skube, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 56. WITH PHOTOS.

</P>
<P>
   GARDENMUSEUM _ LONDON _ It's a gardener's treasure chest _ a
17th-century watering can, shovels more than 100 years old, an
1800s wheelbarrow, even a Victorian cucumber straightener _ and the
goods aren't even outdoors. They're in church. Avid gardeners would
agree that's the perfect sanctuary for worshipping 300 years of
tools that have made their work easier. But the 17th-century church
east of London's embankment is an even more appropriate home for
the Museum of Garden History _ the only collection of its kind in
the world _ because of its own legacy. Its churchyard contains the
tomb of two famed plantsmen, a bit of history that prompted
Rosemary Nicholson and her late husband, John, to open the museum
in the first place. ``People thought we were absolutely mad,'' she
says of their struggle 20 years ago to convert the dilapidated
church and graveyard into an exhibition space and repository for
rare plants. ``They would ask, 'Garden history? What's that? What
do we need to know about it?' `` Apparently lots, as Americans'
passion for gardening reaches levels rivaling that of the British.
``Look at how many people are doing it. It's become such a pasttime
with everyone,'' Nicholson says. (Flanders, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). WITH PHOTOS.
</P>
<P>
   RELIGION
</P>
<P>
   RELIGON-LABYRINTH _ DECATUR, Ga. There is a sense of suspension
in time and space as soft sock feet fall in rhythm on canvas. With
soothing music playing in the background, worshipers at Holy
Trinity Episcopal Church in Decatur are walking the labyrinth. One
evening and one Sunday each month, a carpeted room in the church
becomes a pilgrimage site. The ancient tradition of the labyrinth
has been revived, giving a pattern to meditation. (GWhite, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). WITH PHOTOS.
</P>
<P>
   VOLUNTEER _ B'Nai B'rith, the country's oldest (and world's
largest) service organization, is in the process of collecting
stuffed animals, part of a massive and innovative program to
provide toys for youngsters in area hospitals. (Henry, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   PREACHER-SWAP _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The preacher spoke with
a delightful English accent, but some of the words he used needed
translation. Most of us understand fridge, but calling a sports
utility vehicle a lorry is a stretch. He was preaching in Florida
while his counterpart performed has duties in England. (Gushee,
Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

 &HT;    In light of new `facts,' old transgressions are subject to
review
 &HT;    By Gary Harmon

<P>
   GRAND JUNCTION, Colo. _ We've been so turned upside down for so
long that it's going to take us a while to get our bearings in the
brave new world of Clintonian sexual mores.
</P>
<P>
   We're going to need new handbooks on office conduct and
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   But before we look forward, we ought to look backward a bit and
see how grievously and unjustly we've treated folks who've done
what all the president's mouthpieces assure us ``Everybody Does.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of them have even been naive enough to speak truthfully
when questioned about their escapades, showing that they don't
understand the first thing about genuine moral leadership.
</P>
<P>
   First on that list of folks we now know were held to an
unreasonable standard and who deserve better now that we know
better has to be our former alcohol-tinged local police chief,
Darold Sloan.
</P>
<P>
   Now there's a guy who got taken down either by a vast right-wing
conspiracy or a frequently hinging left elbow, it's hard to tell
which.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, though, if Clinton's OK, then Sloan's OK.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's sex life is his private business. Sloan's drinking
life ought to have been his own business. To suggest that either
couldn't enforce the laws in public while flouting them in private
is narrow-minded and bigoted.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, we have Bill Clinton to help us come to grips with
the peculiar, primitive and destructive notion that presidents and
chiefs of police ought not be above the law.
</P>
<P>
   Sloan was considerate enough to do his drinking in Ridgway, well
outside his own jurisdiction, but hey, Monica Lewinsky has taken
pains to point out that she and the president generally adjourned
for private bouts of Twister to a room off the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   Wouldn't want to spoil the work environment, would we?
</P>
<P>
   Sloan had the misfortune to get caught, then get caught up in a
series of events that undid him. None of that could be foreseen by
a trained police professional. Oh no.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had the misfortune to have selected as sex partner a
thoroughly modern Monica whose notion of discretion was to limit
her chit-chat to a few dozen close friends. No way a seasoned pro
such as himself could have foreseen that. Oh no.
</P>
<P>
   True leaders sometimes have to show the way and Bill Clinton
hasn't failed in that regard. True leaders also have a sense of
timing and we have time yet to evaluate in the cases of Ronald Pond
and Rod Baker.
</P>
<P>
   Pond is a former Grand Junction firefighter who faces
prescription-fraud charges in a case investigated by a Grand
Junction police officer, Rod Baker.
</P>
<P>
   Things looked pretty bad for Pond, what with allegations of drug
use on the job and questions about how he obtained the stuff, until
some things started to come out about the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the small matter that Baker and the
soon-to-be-former Mrs. Pond were involved in a relationship. No
wagging finger of denial here for prosecutors, who wrote that the
relationship ``at some point ... became sexual.''
</P>
<P>
   And a good thing, too. Had it been financial, there might be a
clear conflict, because it is the economy, stupid, but as the
president has made clear, sex doesn't matter. We can rest easy when
it comes to the interrogation techniques of the GJPD.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation cleared both Grand Junction police and Mesa
County District Attorney's Office scrutiny, but some defense
attorney with a misplaced sense of propriety might try to make
something of it before a jury. But The People can point out with
the moral authority of the presidency that ``Everybody Does It.''
</P>
<P>
   Heck, that avenue might even be open to Pond, who could admit
the charges and dismiss them as unimportant because, as everyone
knows, ``Everybody Does It.''
</P>
<P>
   Just change the ``It'' and demand they acquit.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton might have derided Ronald Reagan's ``trickle-down''
economic theory, but he's proven Reagan's case.
</P>
<P>
   The shame is that what's trickled down is enough to make one
throw up.

<P>
   DINOSAUR VALLEY STATE PARK, Texas _ Texas' 1,523-acre state park
that straddles the Paluxy River is appropriately named Dinosaur
Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Dinosaurs spent a lot of time tromping through here. Their
footprints are all over the place.
</P>
<P>
   Now tourists and dinosaur lovers tromp all over the place.
</P>
<P>
   Watching tourists track dinosaur tracks in the riverbed and
along the banks reminded me of the time my nephew and I came across
fresh bear tracks one summer high up in the Rocky Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   We followed the large tracks for about an hour before it dawned
on us that catching up with the bear would be harmful to relatives
who would fall down laughing at our funeral.
</P>
<P>
   It's good that the tromping of dinosaurs and tourists is
separated by 110 million years or so because tourists can sit
inside some of the dinosaur tracks here.
</P>
<P>
   Literature given to visitors entering Dinosaur Valley State Park
near Glen Rose says the first dinosaur tracks were discovered in
1909. But the tracks weren't widely acclaimed until an American
Museum of Natural History official visited the site in 1938.
</P>
<P>
   It's absurd to say the tracks weren't discovered until 1909.
There is archaeological evidence of Indian campsites next to many
of the tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Indians who visited this area were surely experts in
animal tracks, it's interesting to speculate what they must have
thought about the huge tracks imbedded in the limestone.
</P>
<P>
   The three-toed carnosaur tracks look like the tracks of a bird
of unimaginable size. These tracks are between 12 to 24 inches long
and 9 to 17 inches wide. The animals that left these tracks had a
stride that ranged between 45 to 65 inches.
</P>
<P>
   Even more amazing to the ancient Indians would be the footprints
of sauropods that left saucer-like depressions ranging over three
feet long and two feet wide. Besides the four stubby toes of the
back feet, these animals also left smaller horseshoe-shaped tracks
where the front feet depressed the mud that turned to rock. These
animals had a stride from seven to 10 feet.
</P>
<P>
   A third category of dinosaur tracks along the Paluxy River
remains somewhat of a mystery. These tracks, like the carnosaur
tracks, are of a two-legged, three-toed animal. The toes, however,
are not nearly as elongated as those of the carnosaur. The current
best guess is that they are the tracks of an ornithopod, perhaps
the iguanodon.
</P>
<P>
   Generations of native tribes also must have read the remarkable
story left by a double set of tracks.
</P>
<P>
   These renowned tracks were left by a giant brontosaurus-like
sauropod followed by the bird-like tracks of a large carnivorous
dinosaur. This is a record of an ancient hunt. That might have
caused sleepless nights for the Indians who later camped nearby.
</P>
<P>
   What were these fearsome animals? Where did they go? Will they
return?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps this partially answers why dinosaurs are so compelling
to people today.
</P>
<P>
   Americans aren't nearly as interested in other extinct species.
Woolly mammoths, for instance, were enormous animals that also
disappeared. They had huge tusks that curved upwards. That's
interesting.
</P>
<P>
   But no one cranks out toys, movies and books about woolly
mammoths, saber-toothed tigers or any of thousands of other extinct
species.
</P>
<P>
   A growing number of scientists believe they have solved one of
the dinosaur mysteries. They believe dinosaurs did not become
extinct. Today's birds not only are descendants of dinosaurs, they
are dinosaurs, according to an emerging body of evidence.
</P>
<P>
   If so, that answers another dinosaur mystery. What did dinosaurs
taste like? Like chicken, of course.

 &HT;    Warren hopes to shine at Florida
 &HT;    By Randy Riggs
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Despite spending a few relaxing days in Austin
early this summer visiting friends, David Warren is perfectly happy
to be residing in Tallahassee, Fla. Actually, he's happy to be
anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Warren, a defensive end from John Tyler High in Tyler who as the
state's top football recruit two years ago selected Florida State
over the University of Texas, saw his summer vacation take a
bizarre and potentially tragic twist on Aug. 5. Awakening from a
customary afternoon nap in his dorm room, he was stricken by a
seizure that rendered him unconscious and threw the Seminoles into
extreme panic mode.
</P>
<P>
   ``That thing scared us all to death,'' said Jim Gladden, who
coaches Florida State's defensive ends. ``Nobody had a clue what it
was all about.``
</P>
<P>
   The only one not panicking was Warren. For good reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was out. I don't remember anything about it,'' he said. ``So
it was kind of hard to be scared.``
</P>
<P>
   After a battery of hospital tests revealed nothing abnormal,
doctors cleared Warren to practice. So it's opposing teams Warren
hopes to scare in his sophomore season, beginning Monday when the
second-ranked Seminoles play No. 14 Texas A&AMP;M in the Kickoff
Classic at East Rutherford, N.J. Warren seems none the worse for
his scare _ in Florida State's first scrimmage he logged three
sacks, made a tackle behind the line, forced a fumble and broke up
a pass in 43 plays against the first-team offense.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-4-inch, 250-pound Warren is penciled in as a backup
at left end to fellow sophomore Roland Seymour, but in the Florida
State rotation scheme Gladden estimated he'll get at least 40
percent of the plays. Last year, Warren saw spot duty in 10 games
behind All-American Andre Wadsworth, who went on to become the
third overall pick of the NFL draft by the Arizona Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Seminoles' reputation for producing ends like
Wadsworth and Peter Boulware, whom the Baltimore Ravens chose with
the fourth overall pick in 1997 after coming out following his
junior year, that lured Warren toFlorida State. Warren, the USA
Today high school defensive player of the year as a senior at John
Tyler, was leaning toward signing with the Longhorns until he took
his last recruiting visit, to Florida State.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe I made a bad decision at all,'' said Warren.
``Everyone said this is best school for defensive ends to attend,
and I feel that way, too. I believe it's the scheme and style. I
don't know why, exactly, but it seems like the defensive ends here
are always wide open for the sacks.``
</P>
<P>
   Gladden, a 24-year coaching veteran at Florida State who is the
senior member of Bobby Bowden's staff, recruited Warren, luring him
away from Texas despite Warren's kinship to Longhorns legend Earl
Campbell, a cousin. Gladden said the Seminoles expected Warren to
sign with Texas until Boulware announced he was leaving Florida
State early.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Pete announced he was going, his (Warren's) tune
changed,'' said Gladden, who compared Warren to a young Boulware.
``I think he's got a chance to be a lot like him. He's got the same
kind of speed, but he's going to be bigger. David needed to work on
his upper-body strength and he's done that. He's got a 'swole' _
he's 'swolled' up.``
</P>
<P>
   Warren, who also took a recruiting trip to A&AMP;M, says he hasn't
been disowned by his home state for having the traitorous audacity
to leave its borders for school, not that that makes him
particularly unique. In fact, he spent several days in Austin early
in the summer visiting with former Longhorns Joey Ellis and Patrick
Hayes, who also attended John Tyler.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't do much except just visit and go rafting in San
Marcos, but it was a lot of fun,'' Warren reported. ``They were
telling me that if I'd signed with Texas, I could be enjoying
myself like that every day. I just laughed.``
</P>
<P>
   Warren returned to Tallahassee later to attend the second
session of summer school and prepare for the season. Besides his
seizure episode _ ``Just a freak thing, nothing major'' _ he has
been slowed by back spasms. The spasms have bothered him off and on
but hit him hard midway through the traditional 1 1/2-mile run the
Seminoles run on the first day of practice.
</P>
<P>
   Gladden noted that, ``The biggest thing he struggles with right
now is he washes out. The intense humidity and heat cause him to
run out of gas and get drained. But he'll get better at that.``
</P>
<P>
   Despite the painful back spasms, Warren didn't drop out of the 1
1/2-mile run, even though he slowed to a walk and took 17 minutes
to finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get maddest at not pushing myself when I get tired. I don't
want to quit,'' he said. ``It could have been easy to quit that
day, but I never saw Wadsworth quit at doing anything. I just told
myself that it wasn't going to kill me to push myself.

 &HT;    COLUMN: Think things are bad now, Marlins fans?
 &HT;    By Dan Graziano
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ If you thought the trading away of the World Series
roster was tough to watch, wait until you see what may be coming
next.
</P>
<P>
   Marlins General Manager Dave Dombrowski, whose contract expires
at the end of October, interviewed this week for the GM job with
the Los Angeles Dodgers. There's a pretty good chance they'll offer
him the job and a pretty good chance he'll take it.
</P>
<P>
   And that, baseball fans, would truly mean the end.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, kids cried when Moises Alou and Charles Johnson were
traded. And no, you don't see people walking around at games with
``DOMBROWSKI'' stitched across the back of their Marlins jerseys.
But there's no more important person in the organization, and
letting Dombrowski go would be worse than any of the player trades
he was forced to make.
</P>
<P>
   It would signal no hope of recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Given the choice, the Marlins' first and only GM would like to
stay. Dombrowski has presided over the growing pains of the early
years, the elation of the World Series, and the pain of the payroll
purge. He has a wife and a newborn daughter, makes about $700,000
per year and is one of the most respected men in his profession.
And Wayne Huizenga (who, it appears, will still own the team next
year), Don Smiley (whose attempt to buy the team is fading badly)
and John Henry (to whom Huizenga would sell the team if his motives
for doing so were as pure as he originally stated) all have said
they'd want Dombrowski to stay.
</P>
<P>
   But the Dodgers are prepared to offer him $1 million per year.
Hmm ... let's see ... Work for a tradition-rich franchise and an
aggressive new owner who can promise unlimited financial backing
year in and year out? Or stay behind in Florida and wonder what the
future of your team is?
</P>
<P>
   Huizenga may be willing to hang onto the team, but he's showing
no interest in making sure he has a team to hang onto. Dombrowski
isn't the only one without a 1999 contract. Assistant GM Frank
Wren, VP of Player Personnel Gary Hughes (who, incidentally, will
interview for that Dodgers' GM job on Tuesday), VP of Player
Development John Boles _ all are without contracts. The only
baseball operations personnel with 1999 contracts are manager Jim
Leyland (who's probably leaving anyway) and Dominican Operations
Director Jesus Alou.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, sure, people this qualified can all find other jobs. And if
Dombrowski leaves, someone such as Wren or Boles or Hughes could be
in line to take over as Marlins GM. That's not the real worry.
</P>
<P>
   The worry is, how decimated does this team become? Plans already
call for the trading of arbitration-eligible shortstop Edgar
Renteria and left fielder Cliff Floyd after this season. This team
could turn into Montreal South, where the players play until they
improve enough to make big salaries and then are traded to teams
that can afford to pay them.
</P>
<P>
   No matter who buys the team, a stadium would be four or five
years away. So it wouldn't make any sense to start building back up
for about two more years. But even some light, some hope, would be
enough for the core and the braintrust to stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``How wonderful would it be,'' one prominent member of the
organization said last week, ``after all this, to build it back up
again? And win again? That would be one of the greatest
achievements ever. And with what we have here, we could do it.''
</P>
<P>
   But time is running out. If there's no new owner and no new plan
within the next couple of weeks, Dombrowski could be out the door
to Hollywood and take everyone with him. And then what is South
Florida left with?
</P>
<P>
   A team that's not worth watching, most likely.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, a team that's not worth buying.

 &HT;    Housing project residents sue over non-annexation
 &HT;    By Jennifer Peltz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Residents of a Belle Glade housing project have asked a
federal court to right what they see as nearly 40 years of
injustice.
</P>
<P>
   They say the city has discriminated against them and violated
their voting rights by refusing to annex the project.
</P>
<P>
   The case is an echo of America's legal and political past,
scholars say. While courts saw similar cases at the height of the
civil rights movement, they are ``incredibly rare these days,''
University of Florida law professor Fletcher Baldwin said.
</P>
<P>
   The residents' chance of winning hinges on showing a long
history of racial inequality _ the history a lower court refused to
consider last year, saying it simply happened too long ago. That
court ruled for the city, saying there was no present-day proof of
discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   But at least one of the appeals judges wondered this week about
the importance of the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is not all this prior history'' worth considering? Judge
Stanley Marcus asked. ``Isn't all this stuff relevant?''
</P>
<P>
   From 1973 until as recently as 1995, Belle Glade officials
turned down requests to annex the historically black Okeechobee
Center housing complex. They did annex the companion white complex,
Osceola Center, in 1961. The city-appointed Belle Glade Housing
Authority owns and runs both.
</P>
<P>
   Official policy segregated the complexes until 1977. Their
racial makeups remain different: 92 percent of Okeechobee Center
residents are black, compared to 46 percent of Osceola Center
residents, according to the most recent figures available.
</P>
<P>
   To the residents who sued, there's only one explanation.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did something for the white tenants: They gave them
citizenship, the right to vote, various benefits of being in a
city,'' residents' lawyer Neil Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   As city residents, Osceola Center tenants can vote for the city
commissioners who appoint the housing authority board. And they pay
50 percent less than outsiders, including Okeechobee Center
residents, for city water service, court documents say.
</P>
<P>
   ``When asked to do the same for the black tenants, they said
no,'' Bradley said. ``They could not conceivably have had a
non-racial motive for saying no.''
</P>
<P>
   But city officials offer a different rationale.
</P>
<P>
   The Osceola manager clamored for city police protection while
the Okeechobee manager didn't, they say in court papers. The city
can't afford to take in another big public housing project, since
it won't pay taxes. And the Okeechobee Center was too far away to
meet state requirements for annexation, though the requirements
came after residents started asking.
</P>
<P>
   The city also notes that a study committee, which included an
Okeechobee Center resident and other black people, recommended
against annexing the complexation in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court decision isn't expected for at least a month.

 &HT;    High school football: A is for abundant
 &HT;    By John Kelso
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ With high school football upon us, it's time to
mention the need for Texas to eliminate the superfluous letter A
from the high school football size-ranking system.
</P>
<P>
   Since all of the high school football teams in the state get the
letter A as part of their school's designation, such as in Class 1A
for the smallest schools and Class 5A for the largest, the A means
diddly. So let's get rid of it.
</P>
<P>
   I don't mean to sound like Mr. Thinks He Knows Everything, but
how come every school rates an A? I suspect it's for the same
reason you never see any Grade B eggs at the grocery store. Nobody
wants to be called a Grade B egg.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, since all of the high school football teams are
designated as one sort of A or another in Texas, rampant use of
these A's constitutes a serious waste of A's, which could lead to a
serious A shortage.
</P>
<P>
   And think of all the trees that could be saved if newspapers
stopped printing all of these meaningless A's in sports stories
about high school football games.
</P>
<P>
   Follow me closely on this one, and you'll see what I mean.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, you've got the designation 5A for high schools of
1,780 students and up; 4A for 780 to 1779 students; 3A for 345 to
779 students; 2A for 160 to 344 students; and 1A for 159 students
and fewer.
</P>
<P>
   Since all schools get this A as part of their tag, why use it?
Everybody knows Texas is a Class A football state anyway. So why
not conserve A's and rate the high school teams by size as simply
Class 1 through 5?
</P>
<P>
   Even Charles Breithaupt, athletic director of the University
Interscholastic League, which governs Texas high school sports,
agrees with me.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the A, he admitted, ``has no significance.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've thought about going to something like the NHL,'' he
said. The National Hockey League names its divisions after people.
For example, in the NHL there is the Smythe Division, named after
some clown named _ you got it _ Smythe.
</P>
<P>
   To make it Texan, ``we could have something like the Billy Bob
Division,'' Breithaupt said.
</P>
<P>
   This whole A overload got started, Breithaupt explained, back in
the days when Texas had both Class A and Class B high school
football teams. From 1952 through 1979 Texas had Class 1A through
4A schools, along with a Class B designation for the smallest
schools.
</P>
<P>
   As you can imagine, the little Class B schools crabbed because
they thought being called Class B made them sound second-rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't want to be B,'' Breithaupt said. ``They thought it
was a substandard conference because of that designation.''
</P>
<P>
   The whole thing reminds me of churches. Ever notice how you
never see a Second Baptist Church? At some point one of these
outfits had to show up second. But none of them will admit it
because Americans have this hang-up about being first.
</P>
<P>
   This is why, after football games, you never see guys marching
through the streets holding up a bunch of fingers and hollering,
``We're No. 9.''
</P>
<P>
   It's kind of like the deal with pizzas. Ever notice how you
can't find a ``small'' pizz a anymore? It's all medium and large
these days. Or, if it's teeny, they label the pizza ``individually
sized'' so they can jack up the price and charge $8.95 for this
midget.
</P>
<P>
   So since all the high schools in Texas are ranked A, why keep
the letter? Let's make A take A hike.

 &HT;    University may close co-ops
 &HT;    By Angela Shah
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ University of Texas administrators could decide
in two weeks whether to shut down the university's Women's
Cooperative _ eliminating a campus fixture since the Great
Depression _ to make room for next year's freshmen.
</P>
<P>
   James Vick, UT vice president for student affairs, said that
administrators are reviewing the future of 12 buildings that house
about 220 students on the northwest side of campus near Kinsolving
dormitory. The students, most of whom are women, have leases with
UT that expire in May.
</P>
<P>
   ``The university is in the midst of a lot of change in housing.
We feel it's very important to have about 75 percent of freshmen in
dorms,'' Vick said. ``The co-ops have the smallest percentage, at
about 25 percent. We're trying to decide whether to have co-ops.''
</P>
<P>
   UT's housing view is shared by other large, public universities
like rival Texas A&AMP;M. Students who begin academic careers living on
campus thrive because of the proximity to student services and the
extended family dorm life provides, Vick said.
</P>
<P>
   UT is seeking a greater voice in the day-to-day management of
the usually semi-autonomous co-ops. The co-ops have traditionally
maintained a 21-member council of residents that decides who may
live in co-op housing and how each house spends its money.
</P>
<P>
   Co-op residents buy and cook their own food, divide chores among
residents and maintain a budget for their ``household.'' Until
recently, the co-ops residents were all female.
</P>
<P>
   But a recent threat of a lawsuit by two male UT students seeking
access to the co-ops spurred UT administrators to order co-op
leaders to admit men and take a closer look at operations of the
co-ops. Sixteen spaces in one co-op have been set aside for male
residents. Only 11 of those spaces are filled, said Jay Neiverth,
office manager for the co-ops.
</P>
<P>
   If administrators decide to shut down the co-ops, Neiverth said
UT will be eliminating a vital source of affordable housing for
many students. Created in the 1930s to provide economical housing
for women students, the co-ops today continue to be good bargains.
Students pay about $3,000 each year _ about $1,000 less than in any
other campus dormitory _ to live in a co-op, he said. As landlord,
UT collects rent and provides security and overall maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we are allowed to stay here, we could make it 75 percent
freshmen,'' Neiverth said. ``If that's what it takes to remain on
campus, that's what we'll do.''
</P>
<P>
   Vick said administrators are considering requiring that 75
percent of co-op spaces go to freshmen. ``It certainly has been
mentioned,'' he said. ``But there is some question how effective
the co-ops would be. The co-op leadership has usually come from
more advanced students.''
</P>
<P>
   UT administrators and co-op officials also are deciding what to
do about $700,000 that UT Women's Cooperative, an unincorporated
nonprofit, has in an investment portfolio. The money was left over
from residents who lived in co-ops before1989 and whose expenses
were lower than their housing fees. In 1989, the co-ops began
giving refunds to residents if their housing fees were not used by
the end of the year. Vick said administrators want to make sure
they are not left with a tax liability if the money is turned over
to the UT Women's Cooperative.
</P>
<P>
   Neiverth said the co-op council is trying to incorporate as a
nonprofit, which is tax exempt.

 &HT;    Wachovia moves in to South Florida, touting more products
 &HT;    By Danielle Herubin
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Signs and computer equipment at more
than 30 former offices of 1st United Bancorp are being replaced
this week as Wachovia Bank makes its official entry into South
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Wachovia, based in Winston-Salem, N.C., bought Boca Raton-based
1st United late last year for about $222 million.
</P>
<P>
   1st United had offices in Palm Beach, Martin, Broward and
Brevard counties.
</P>
<P>
   Warren S. Orlando, former head of 1st United and now chief
executive of Wachovia's Florida Banking, said customers won't
notice much change because the personalities of the two banks are
similar.
</P>
<P>
   But they will have access to more products, Orlando said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Wachovia (NYSE: WB, $79.25) will provide free
financial planning, from saving for a child's college education to
investing in stocks for retirement, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wachovia also offers Internet banking. Customers can log on at
any time, move money between accounts and make investments.
</P>
<P>
   Wachovia Chief Executive L.M. Baker Jr., who was in Palm Beach
County Thursday to meet with former 1st United employees, said he
expects 200,000 of Wachovia's customers, or 5 percent, to use
Internet banking by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Customers already using it are having a much easier time than
anyone predicted, Baker said.
</P>
<P>
   ''You tell me your grandmother won't do it,'' he said. ``Well,
you better check with your grandmother.''
</P>
<P>
   Wachovia, which offers business and consumer banking, has more
than 750 offices in the Southeast, including 39 in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   It has $48.5 billion in assets and 21,800 employees, including
470 in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Wachovia will begin an advertising campaign in September,
Orlando said.

 Color slides and black and white photos of Matt Damon with Gretchen
Mol in a scene from ``Rounders'' and with Robin Williams in a scene
from ``Good Will Hunting.'' 
 By IVOR DAVIS 
 Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Not long ago Matt Damon was down and out in Hollywood.
 &HT;    The boyish actor was counting pennies, living on beans and
wondering if he'd ever get work for bit parts in TV sitcoms.
 &HT;    What a difference a couple of years make.
 &HT;    Today at 28 Damon is the hottest actor in Hollywood. He's been
on the cover of just about every major magazine since he and his
writing partner Ben Affleck sold their ``Good Will Hunting'' script
to Hollywood for half a million dollars and as a bonus took home
the Oscar for screenwriting. Now Damon finds himself working
virtually around the clock.
 &HT;    Currently he's appearing in the title role in Steven Spielberg's
blockbuster ``Saving Private Ryan.'' On Sept. 11 he shows up in a
leading role in ``Rounders,'' a film about professional poker
players, costarring Edward Norton, Martin Laundau, John Turturo and
John Malkovich. Damon plays a cardsharp who uses his winnings to
put himself through law school.
 &HT;    He's about to spend five months in Italy shooting ``The Talented
Mr. Ripley'' opposite Jude Law, with ``English Patient'' director
Anthony Minghella. Billy Bob Thornton will direct him in ``All The
Pretty Horses'' early next year.
 &HT;    Damon was hired for ``Saving Private Ryan'' while on the set of
``Good Will Hunting,'' when Robin Williams introduced him to
Spielberg. Damon compared working on ``Ryan'' to ``having a
scholarship into the best film school in the world.''
 &HT;    On the personal front he ended his high-profile romance with his
``Good Will'' costar Minnie Driver shortly after going on TV to
announce his love for her. Since the Oscars he has been dating
Winona Ryder so persistently that USA Today ran a story that said,
``Winona and Matt are not engaged.''
 &HT;    Sitting in a swank hotel in Marina Del Rey, Calif., he smiles at
the story: ``Well, I don't want to talk about it. There was a time
when I was very open about my personal life but I've made mistakes
before. This engagement stuff is kind of silly.''
 &HT;    Apart from the occasional wince, however, he handles his
newfound status with aplomb and tries to keep a sense of
proportion.
 &HT;    ``It's gotten a little crazy,'' he sighs. ``But I think it's all
due to the power of the media. Look, in the mid-'80s there were
stories that said Michael Jackson and Bruce Springsteen were the
biggest stars in the world. Michael couldn't leave the house
without 25 bodyguards and Springsteen you could bump into in a
local bar. I think it's all what you make of it. I'm not gonna do
the whole bodyguard nonsense _ or anything like that. I'm trying to
keep things in perspective.''
 &HT;    Family and friends in hometown Boston help keep his feet on the
ground. ``I'm really lucky that it didn't happen until now,'' he
says. ``I have a whole bunch of people I grew up with who aren't
that impressed but are happy for us.''
 &HT;    One of them is Ben Affleck, his longtime writing and acting pal
who is now dating Gwyneth Paltrow. ``I haven't seen him in a while,
'' says Damon, ``but I like to kid him about Gwyneth _ I'd
telephone and say, 'Hey, your girlfriend is doing real good. How
are those love scenes going?'''
 &HT;    He says Affleck plans to join him in Italy to finish a script.
``It might be a story about a halfway house in Boston,'' says
Damon. ``We've done 150 pages ... but only five of them were
usable. We're dying to get to work. ``Good Will Hunting'' is a hard
act to follow.'
 &HT;    Also they both have concerns about overusing their friendship
and the cute story of their collaboration. ``We're getting to the
point,'' Damon explains, ``where we don't want to feel we pimped
out our friendship _ especially with the flood of stories about how
we grew up together. And sometimes you can't help feeling that
you're whoring out your personal life for professional gain.''
 &HT;    If he seems overly cautious about, ``the success thing'', it's
because he sees the danger signs everywhere he goes. ``People laugh
at your jokes too hard now and you know the joke wasn't that funny.
But then maybe after a while you think it is. ''
 &HT;    Still he wants to make it clear he's not one of those stars who
no sooner get a whiff of success than they start whining about a
loss of privacy. ``I went from needing money and really needing a
job to being able to sit back and pick select jobs really
carefully. It's an incredible feeling. Things have turned into an
embarrassment of riches _ it's every dream I've ever dared dream
come true.
 &HT;    ``And it's tough to have a bad day when you're in the dairy
section of the supermarket and people keep coming up and saying,
'Good job.''''

DISH WATCHING IN MARTHA'S VINEYARD 
</HEADLINE>
  By WALTER SHAPIRO 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Let others cover wars and famine. Slate's Chatterbox has taken
on a true hardship assignment _ dining out every night to collect
the latest Vineyard gossip and dish. Take a gander:
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Call Waiting: &LR;  Whenever Clintonites gather these days, one of
the first questions they ask each other is ``How many times did
Gail Sheehy call you today?'' Sheehy, the best-selling expert on
mid-life crises, has been on the island for a week working on
another Vanity Fair psychological profile of Hillary Clinton. Maybe
her desperation was fueled by her far from lavish $99-a-night
accommodations at the Katama Shores Inn (she checked out Tuesday)
or maybe she's just a more dogged reporter than Chatterbox, but
Sheehy has been phoning rightfully reluctant members of Team
Hillary as often as 10 times a day. Chatterbox hears that Sheehy's
purported big scoop is that the president didn't tell his wife the
truth about Madcap Monica until 30 minutes before he went on TV.
Modesty prevents Chatterbox from mentioning that he reported last
week on Hillary's hidebound refusal to face up to the realities of
her errant husband.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Ketch 22: &LR;  Did you see the jaunty nautical pictures of Walter
Cronkite entertaining a carefree Bill Clinton aboard the former
anchorman's ketch? What a perfect balance of yin and yang: The
``most trusted man'' in America and the least. Chatterbox recalls
that last summer Clinton went sailing with Ted Kennedy, not exactly
the companion the imagemakers would recommend for a president
desperate to divert attention from a sex scandal.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Fair Weather Friends: &LR;  What continues to amaze Chatterbox is
how quickly elite opinion here has turned against the president. A
typical Vineyard dinner party now begins with gleeful discussions
of a scurrilous Matt Drudge report claiming that Monica found
entertaining uses for the president's cigar. In the Clinton White
House, the war against tobacco takes you to some strange and
unusual places. (Given Drudge's legendary tussles with accuracy,
Chatterbox wants to stress that, according to a euphemism-filled
Howie Kurtz story this morning, ``The Washington Post has not
confirmed the allegation.'') Equally comic in Vineyard circles are
the fast-dwindling band of presidential flatterers. One well-known
Clinton fan actually told the president that his maladroit mea
culpa was ``brilliant.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Chatterbox Explains It All: &LR;  Sycophants aside, why are so many
of Clinton's purported friends now writing him off? For seven
months, the Clinton faithful regarded the White House stonewalling
tactics with the same awe that the French once had for the Maginot
Line. No matter how persuasive the charges against the president,
loyal Democrats assumed that Clinton would artfully explain them
away as soon as he went on television. But then came the Clinton
speech that had all the persuasive power of Ishtar. Suddenly, Ken
Starr had, in effect, flanked the Maginot Line, and was fast on the
road to Paris. What we are witnessing now is something analogous to
the defeatism that gripped the French Army in 1940. All the fervent
talk of a congressional censure resolution is akin to the Allies
offering Hitler Belgium if only he'd stop there. But why should
Starr and the Republicans accept a cease fire offer when they are
beginning to believe that total victory is in their grasp?

THE MYTH OF OVERSOLD MARKETS 
</HEADLINE>
  By JAMES SUROWIECKI 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   You hear the word ``oversold'' from stock traders and market
watchers a lot lately, especially from those trying to figure out
if the market has hit a near-term bottom or whether it still has a
way to fall.
</P>
<P>
   Strictly speaking, ``oversold'' is a word that should be used
only by technical analysts (those who believe that an individual
stock's or a market's future movements can be predicted on the
basis of their past movements), and since technical analysts are
the market equivalent of astrologers, ``oversold'' is about as
meaningful as ``her moon is now in the house of Mars'' (or whatever
it is astrologers say).
</P>
<P>
   But when the market is as volatile as it has been over the past
month, people start searching for answers everywhere, so the idea
of a possibly oversold market now crops up with startling
regularity.
</P>
<P>
   What's startling is not that investors remain anxious to find
potentially hopeful signs in a market that has finally caught on to
the reality of a dramatic slowdown in corporate earnings growth.
Instead, what's startling is just how meaningless the very idea of
an oversold (or overbought) market is.
</P>
<P>
   An oversold market is presumably one in which too much stock has
been sold too quickly, and in which sellers have been too willing
to dump shares without much concern for price. That means, we're
meant to believe, that a rally is inevitable as the market returns
to some form of equilibrium, and buyers in a sense catch up to
sellers.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that this only makes sense if the return to
equilibrium is the natural default position. In other words, a
market can only be oversold if there has not been a meaningful
change in investor sentiment about the market as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   If investors who were once willing to pay 30 times earnings for
a growth stock are now only willing to pay 20 times earnings for a
growth stock, then sellers should overwhelm buyers, because the
market needs to make its way down to that new ``equilibrium''
(though that's the wrong word).
</P>
<P>
   In other words, as with all technical analysis, the concept of
an oversold market is useless because it excludes all the important
information that actually moves markets, and because it doesn't
accept the possibility that things might really be different this
time. That's why it can keep predicting bounce-back rallies until
the day when it can't.
</P>
<P>
   As the stock market kept falling all through 1930, I'm sure
there were many days when technical analysts assured themselves
that the market was oversold. And yet it just kept falling.
</P>
<P>
   This is not, of course, 1930. Not at all. But the ascent of this
market has been so steep and so rapid (while also being so
prolonged), that there is very little room for bad news, even now.
</P>
<P>
   More to the point, many companies have seen their stock prices
rise so sharply in the past three years that even when they fall a
long way, there's a lot farther for them to fall than many
investors believe.
</P>
<P>
   To make this concrete, look at semiconductor equipment maker
Applied Materials, which Tuesday announced major job cuts and
capacity reduction in response to a continued slump in demand due
almost entirely to the Asian crisis. Applied Materials' stock price
is half its 52-week high, and it's tumbled mildly over the past
month. But the stock is still three times as expensive relative to
the company's underlying assets as it was two years ago, which is
the last time the semiconductor industry went through a sharp
downturn. Which is to say that to say the stock is now fairly
valued means that you think it's worth three times as much as it
was in 1996. The logic there is difficult to discover.
</P>
<P>
   Whether we're oversold or not isn't what matters, then. What
matters is whether investors' underlying assumptions about stock
prices and corporate earnings have changed or will change.
Everything else is just short-term noise.

SPIELBERG BASHES INTELLECTUALS 
</HEADLINE>
  By NICHOLAS LEMANN  
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first time I saw ``Saving Private Ryan,'' it was hard to
react in any way more nuanced than just being nearly flattened by
its overwhelming power. The second time, though, I detected one
false, and creepy, note. That is the demonization of Upham, the
translator in Captain John Miller's ``stick,'' in the final
extended battle scene.
</P>
<P>
   Over and over, we are reminded of Upham's cowardice: Upham, in
giant trembly sweaty closeup, cringes in fear. Upham fails to come
to the aid of his buddies. Upham has a series of clear shots at
German soldiers who don't see him, and can't bring himself to pull
the trigger. When Upham finally does kill, it's too late to do any
good, and in clear violation of the Geneva Conventions. (I saw the
movie at a multiplex in the Bronx, and my appreciation of this
point was sharpened by the audience's yelling ``faggot!'' every
time Upham's face filled the screen.)
</P>
<P>
   You're clearly meant to hold Upham personally responsible for
the death of three of his comrades at arms, including, as I read
the narrative logic, Captain Miller, the hero.
</P>
<P>
   The creepy part is, Upham is a sensitive, artistic type who
announces early in the movie that he wants to depict the bonds that
form among soldiers in combat--all of which also applies to the
auteur of ``Saving Private Ryan,'' Steven Spielberg. Spielberg
isn't the first fictionalizer of war to establish his macho bona
fides by humiliating a spun-off, pusillanimous version of himself.
</P>
<P>
   Remember Keefer, the writer-character in ``The Caine Mutiny,''
who spends most of his time proclaiming the superiority of moral
principle to personal loyalty (just like Upham) and then gets
humiliatingly told off in the end? The move here is to react to the
automatic suspicion of anyone artsy in a military setting by
signing on to it, rather than challenging it. See, I agree with
you! They are all pansies! I'm a regular guy too!
</P>
<P>
   The Upham character is a particularly lurid example--his body
type (skinny) and his movements (mincing) are completely different
from those of the other soldiers, and seem somehow to be linked to
his being more educated. Could his cartoonishness be an indication
of how defensive Spielberg, who like nearly all upper-middle-class
Americans of his generation didn't serve in Vietnam, feels
regarding the military and its virtues?

THE TOUGHEST COOKBOOK WRITER ON EARTH 
</HEADLINE>
  By NICHOLAS LEMANN  
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The dream of every artist is to be a genius who is also wildly
popular, but the way it usually works out is that there is an
inexact fit between giftedness and broad appeal. Every one of the
arts has a spectrum of esteem with the rich and unrespected at one
end, the difficult and audience-less at the other, and most people
somewhere in between. This is no less true in cookbook writing than
it is in literature or painting or music. In the foodie world, the
William Gaddis, the Ad Reinhardt, the John Cage, the inaccessible
deity, is Paula Wolfert.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfert burst upon the food scene 25 years ago with a book
called Couscous and Other Good Food From Morocco. There she
unveiled a technique that a few other food writers (Colman Andrews,
Diana Kennedy, Charles Perry) practice but which none equals: the
fierce anthropological/reportorial quest for folkish recipes that
are hiding in out-of-the-way, premodern places. In her cookbooks
Wolfert is always traipsing up to some unelectrified mountain
encampment and finding an old woman dressed all in black who has
spent a lifetime perfecting one master dish whose ingredients she
communicates to Wolfert using sign language.
</P>
<P>
   I you aren't a cookbook consumer you may not know that in many
of them, the recipes just don't work--their results are
irreproducible. This isn't ever a problem with Wolfert, whose
recipes never fail and are written clearly and (a minor miracle in
any cookbook) unannoyingly. She doesn't project her feelings about
sex and civilization all over the food. So what is it that makes
her difficult? It is that, rather than endeavoring to achieve a
compromise between the American palate and way of life and the
cuisine she's writing about, she goes for total faithfulness. Since
her eternal subject is the traditional food of ordinary people
living in the countryside of the Mediterranean rim, this means that
she presents American readers with many nearly unobtainable
ingredients and a way of cooking invented by people who have
nothing in their routine that makes it inconvenient to tend a stove
all day.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfert's second book, Mediterranean Cooking, was notorious for
not having a chapter devoted to main courses, even though that's
all the average American cook can be induced to make. In her third
book, The Cooking of Southwest France, you really can't get all
that far unless you put up substantial quantities of goose or duck
confit, a basic building block ingredient that is used in many
other recipes. This requires going through 14 detailed steps over
two and a half days, and the end result contains four cups of
</P>
<P>
   rendered goose fat per three quarts of confit--and Wolfert brags
that her confit recipe represents ``a reasonable compromise with
our less leisurely household rhythms.'' When The Cooking of the
Eastern Mediterranean was published in 1994, Dean &AMP; DeLuca, the New
York emporium, sold a special Wolfert ingredient package to make
life a little easier for people who might not be able immediately
to lay their hands on Aleppo pepper, fenugreek, marigold petals,
pomegranate molasses, and other Georgian, Syrian, and Greek stock
items that the book requires.
</P>
<P>
   I imagine the suits at Wolfert's publishing house calling her in
and pleading with her: ``Please, Paula, do diet! Do bistro! Do
California! Do 30-minute!'' But probably they know not to waste
their breath. For the fall of 1998, Wolfert has a new entry
demonstrating that her resolve not to go mainstream remains
granitic. It's called Mediterranean Grains and Greens.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfert makes most of her usual moves here. She displays a
Faulknerian conviction that the same seemingly narrow band of
material (Mediterranean countryside cooking) can be returned to
again and again and will keep yielding new riches. Don't expect her
to abandon her Yoknapatawpha County in the future, either: ``I've
come to understand how meagerly I've scratched the surface, how
much more exploration remains to be done,'' she writes in the
introduction to this, her sixth book on essentially the same
subject. She retains her faith in obscure ingredients (some of
which she advises us just to grow, because there isn't any place to
buy them) and in labor-intensive cooking methods. Wolfert wrote a
whole cookbook about Morocco in which the premise was that you were
allowed to buy couscous in boxes at the grocery store--though you
weren't allowed to use the instant recipe on the box and had to
substitute a four step, 90 minute cooking process. Now, having
thought it over, she'd really prefer you make your own couscous at
home from semolina, ``which is easy and fun.''
</P>
<P>
   If I haven't already made it clear, Wolfert's obsessiveness
isn't unappealing. Every amateur cook, indeed every hobbyist, has a
secret impulse, kept carefully in check, just to go all the way
with the thing and descend into complete mania. Wolfert offers the
thrill of watching somebody else do what you'd like to but can't
let yourself. Actually to cook from her books without going on a
leave of absence from work, though, requires adapting her recipes
and selectively ignoring her advice, even though to do so is guilt
inducing. She wants you to use Carnaroli rice, which is readily
available by mail order, but I used Arborio rice from my local
supermarket--there, I've admitted it! At least it wasn't Uncle
Ben's.
</P>
<P>
   Do you know how, when you go to the vegetable stand or the
supermarket, there's a section you usually ignore that is devoted
to mounds of cheap, unwieldy looking greens such as kale, chard,
broccoli rabe, chicory, collard, and dandelion? Well, after you buy
Mediterranean Grains and Greens you won't be ignoring them anymore.
Most of the recipes involve some blend of these with a grain--rice
or bulgur or bread or couscous or pasta--and some earthy variety of
meat or fish. Although Wolfert is quick to inform us that many of
the greatest greens of the Mediterranean are simply unobtainable
anywhere else, and although many of her recipes call for greens
that are hard to find, such as sorrel and purslane, if you're
willing to substitute (forgive me, Paula) this is one of Wolfert's
most accessible works.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that greens only look forbidding but are quite easy
to handle--you just wash them and wilt them in a pot and a green
haystack suddenly becomes a manageable couple of handfuls. It also
turns out that their strong flavor mellows and creeps interestingly
into other ingredients during cooking, and that their bitterness
permits the use of a whole range of sweet ingredients, such as
fruit, that would otherwise be cloying, and that each of those
greens you've never tried has a unique, appealing flavor. The
sense-memories that linger after a week of cooking from
Mediterranean Grains and Greens are of an intensity, a range, and
an unusualness of flavor that you just don't get from more
conventional cookbooks. Try the squid smothered in greens with
raisins, or the pork-and-artichoke meatloaf wrapped in cabbage
leaves, both relatively easy to make, and you'll see what I mean.
The ratio of Wolfert advantages (daring, refusal to compromise,
authenticity, unconventionality) to Wolfert disadvantages (her
tendency to induce an overwhelming feeling of ``why bother?'') is
as high here as it has ever been.
</P>
<P>
   It is the unfair fate of foodies (and even more so of winies) to
have their preoccupation with the minutiae of their field taken for
snobbery. Somehow when baseball fans invent arcane new statistics
and bridge players fly all over the country to tournaments it's
endearing, but the same slightly out of control search for the new
comes across as motivated by an unsavory need to impress others
when it involves eating. A cynic might take Wolfert, and Wolfert
fans like me, for reverse snobs, down-homing to mask the
fundamental one-upmanship. But this would be vile calumny. Wolfert
is merely a perfectionist and a visionary, and such people should
be our heroes.

RAYMOND BROWN HELPED CLARIFY GOD'S WORD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL TAMMEUS  
 c. 1998 KANSAS CITY STAR 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's not unreasonable to ask what _ after all these centuries _
is left to learn about the Bible. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The simple answer is a lot, despite all the books, commentaries,
sermons, concordances, criticisms and meditations. Indeed, careful
scholarship is essential to help followers of both Christianity and
Judaism understand Holy Writ and its meaning for today. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That's why the recent death of the Rev. Raymond E. Brown is such
a loss. Brown, 70, was a Roman Catholic scholar who taught at a
Protestant institution, Union Theological Seminary in New York, for
nearly two decades. He was perhaps the most respected Christian
student of the Bible today. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   His passion was understanding what writers of the Bible meant
and how their first readers would have understood the words. Among
his nearly 40 books are definitive works on the biblical narratives
about the birth and death of Jesus Christ. His next-to-final book,
``An Introduction to the New Testament,'' tries to tell people in
the pews why all the minutiae of scholarship _ the footnotes, the
long arguments over precise meanings of Greek and Hebrew words _ is
so important. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And, more to the point, in this book Brown tried to help
Christians, many of whom are abysmally ignorant about the Bible,
grasp the meaning of the primary witness to the man they revere as
savior and lord. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I had a rare chance last fall to hear Brown speak to an
almost-full gymnasium at Rockhurst College, a Jesuit school in
Kansas City. It was heartening to see several hundred people spend
a week night sitting quietly at the feet of a modest but clear
pastor as he spoke about the Bible. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It really has been an extraordinary century,'' he said. That,
of course, applies to nearly all aspects of our lives, but
certainly also to biblical scholarship, especially in the Catholic
world, which, as Brown pointed out, entered into the modern study
of the scriptures in 1893 with encouragement from an encyclical by
Pope Leo XIII. Scientific investigation of biblical claims, Brown
said, had influenced the pope to set scholars loose. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Since then Bible scholarship has had ups and downs. In both
Catholic and Protestant circles early in this century, Brown said,
there were moves toward authoritarian decrees full of ``utter
rigor.'' These were about such issues as authorship and dating of
the books of the Bible. The Catholic tendency in this was
(over)matched in Protestantism by the rise of fundamentalism,
which, as Brown said, ``took the route of Biblical literalism.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By the 1930s, the world of biblical studies was divided into
three: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Professional scholars in universities and some Protestant
seminaries who were largely unconnected to Catholic scholars. These
Protestants were engaged in the kind of historical criticism of
texts the fundamentalists abhorred. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ The fundamentalists themselves, who were defining and
defending biblical literalism. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Catholic scholars, who were engaged most in technical areas of
study, such as word meanings. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   All this began to change by mid-century, Brown said, with
discovery of earlier and earlier manuscripts of biblical books and
with a 1943 encyclical from Pope Pius XII that moved the Catholic
church to give more professional training to Bible translators and
allowed those translators to use modern methods of critical study. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, this tended to narrow differences between Catholic and
Protestant scholars. In 1949 Brown himself went to study in Rome,
where he began his long, remarkably productive journey as a Bible
scholar. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Several decades ago, Brown noted, so much intriguing ecumenical
biblical scholarship was going on that ``there was a brief moment
when we thought Camelot had arrived. But Camelots don't last.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, late in his life Brown worried that the media ignore
scholarly work by theological centrists. Worse, he said, such work
doesn't get communicated well by the church to people in the pews.
Instead, most attention goes to such fringe scholarship as that
being done by the so-called Jesus Seminar, a group of scholars who
seem most interested in what they don't believe. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And yet Brown was no pessimist. He understood the inherently
explosive power of the book he spent his life studying. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The gospel,'' he said, ``will have its word even after this
century passes by.'' And that word will be clearer because of
Brown's vital work. &QL;
</P>
<P>

   GUNS-BAN (Sacramento) _ California Gov. Pete Wilson has vowed to

too far and invites lawsuits. By ROBERT SALLADAY.
</P>

   AIDS-SCAM (San Francisco) _ A Sacramento AIDS activist says he
mailed 4,000 bogus letters billing Northern Californians $76 each

   INDIAN-PARK (Albany, N.Y.) _ A confederacy of Indian tribes is

   SHARK-BITE (San Francisco) _ When razor-sharp teeth attached to
a 2,000-pound eating machine known as a great white shark rip
through your skin, it's a good idea to fight back. And, hopefully,
you'll have a friend handy to help you out. A 16-year-old San

   CALIF-JUDGE (Sacramento) _ Gov. Pete Wilson is considering a
parting gift to termed-out state Sen. Quentin L. Kopp of San
Francisco _ a judgeship on the Sonoma County Superior Court. But

   JAPAN-CRISIS (San Francisco) _ The real culprit for the latest
market troubles is Japan. Although most analysts blamed Thursday's
global market slide on the Russian economy, the downturn can be
traced to the 3 percent decline in Tokyo's Nikkei average the day
before. Japan's inability to resolve its own crisis is keeping
global markets from recovering. By LARRY AMERNICK.

   RADIO-LEYKIS (Albany, N.Y.) _ Tom Leykis has no clue what he is
doing. It's minutes before he goes on the air, where Leykis will
impart his usual mix of core beliefs and insights and whatever else
he can think of to a coast-to-coast radio audience. This is
national, baby, high-tech, high-minded entertainment. And Leykis is
a professional. By MARK McGUIRE.

   FILM-FOOLS-REVIEW (Undated) _ ``Why Do Fools Fall in Love,'' the

   FILM-REVIEW-54 (Undated) _ Even a dim bulb can have a few bright

Ryan Phillippe's pants. That's where the fun begins and ends in
this dull movie. By AMY BIANCOLLI.

<P>
   OLY-WOMEN'S-HOCKEY (Lake Placid, N.Y.) _ The ever-growing
diversity of the talent pool in the U.S. women's ice hockey circle
shows how the sport is growing in popularity. Seventy-two young
women gathered this week at Lake Placid's Olympic Center to share
their abilities _ and prepare for the next Olympic event. By TIM
REYNOLDS.

   COMMENTARY (``k'' category)
</P>
<P>
   MORSE-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ Going to Russia is just the
ticket to improve Bill Clinton's morale. The best healing process
for low self-esteem is to look good in comparison with someone
else. Why not go see Boris Yeltsin next week, do the twist with
some Kremlin interns, and enjoy the company of a world leader who
has more trouble than you do? By ROB MORSE.
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-WELFARE (San Francisco) _ OK, let's talk about moral
responsibility as the growing chorus of bipartisan voices is making
it clear that President Clinton has lost the moral authority to
lead. The upcoming two-year anniversary of welfare reform should
make this fact crystal clear. That's right, welfare reform. By STAR
PARKER.
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-CONFESS (San Francisco) _ In Protestant, puritan and
prudish America, President William J. Clinton is slowly becoming a
Catholic. He seems to be developing a deeper sense of sin, the
fallen state of humankind, and the need to confess. By ALBERTO
HUERTA.
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-GAYS (San Francisco) _ As an American watching President
Clinton pretend to apologize to the nation for having an
inappropriate relationship with former intern Monica Lewinsky, I
felt embarrassed, sad and angry. But as a gay American, I felt
despair. To the extent that the scandal will hamper Clinton's
effectiveness, I felt I was losing a quiet warrior for the rights
of my community. By DAVE FORD.

   JUST FOR YOU: Song For You, a Los Angeles company, offers to
compose music and lyrics to fit any occasion or person, and deliver
that song permanently preserved on a compact disc. You provide the
information _ name, event, likes or dislikes, habits or hobbies _
and Song For You writes words, adapts music, records its singers
performing the tune and prints the recipient's name on a CD. The
company has joshed a birthday boy about his fondness for McDonald's
food, for example, and found rhymes for an anniversary tune about a
man who enjoys hunting. Although Song For You has operated for a
decade in Israel, the Netherlands and Britain, where it claims a
half-million sales, the company's U.S. operations are but a few
months old. The service costs $59 per song. For information or to
order, call 800-789-SONG (7664).

   COMBO CARRIER: Those folks at Levenger, a catalog of ``tools for
serious readers,'' have found a device that's halfway between a
wallet and a moneyclip. Face it: billfolds can get bulky, causing
pocket bulges and lopsided sitting, and moneyclips are
ostentatious, sending the message that you carry so many bills that
they threaten to burst from your trousers unless you keep them
firmly fastened. Levenger's idea pairs a moneyclip on one side (it
can manage up to 30 bills) with a slot on the other that holds one
to five cards _ credit, debit, charge, work ID and driver's
license, let's say. The solid brass Smart Money Clip, available in
matte-black or 24k-gold-plated finishes, costs $25. To order one or
request a catalog, full of fountain pens, desk accessories, comfy
chairs and whatnots, call 800-544-0880 or visit the catalog's site

   PIANO LESSONS BY PHONE: By dialing 541-664-6751 will get you a
three-minute mini piano lesson for only the price of a
long-distance telephone call. A recent recording succintly
explained and demonstrated a chord technique called ``straddling''

to embellish a standard arrangement of a song. Coincidentally,
``How To Dress Up Naked Music'' is one of the several hundred
courses available from Keyboard Workshop, the Oregon business that

Sounds on Any Keyboard _ Without Knowing a Thing About Music.''
Courses typically include sheet music, a cassette tape and a video,
and range from $40 to $200. For a free catalog, call the above

   Mleczko, a Harvard senior, is 23, is 5-feet-11-inches tall,
shoots from the left, has played on three national teams and is the
owner of an Olympic gold medal.
</P>
<P>
   Darwitz is an eighth-grader at Eagan Junior/Senior High School
in Eagan, Minn. She is 14, and is nine inches and 40 pounds shy of
matching Mleczko's frame. She shoots from the right side and has
never before been at a full-fledged national team camp of any kind.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few days, however, they have been teammates at the
USA Hockey Women's Festival at the Olympic Center in Lake Placid.
Mleczko is the oldest player of the 72 invitees at the camp;
Darwitz is the youngest.
</P>
<P>
   The differences between the two players illustrate the
ever-growing diversity of the talent pool in the U.S. women's ice
hockey circle, with Mleczko representing the corps of current
stalwarts that skated to Olympic gold last February in Nagano,
Japan, and Darwitz one of the heir apparents who will be asked to
carry the program to even loftier heights in the next millennium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you can look at anybody here and say that they can
play in the next Olympics. I really do,'' Mleczko said. ``The fact
that they're here means they have the potential and capacity to
improve and get there. Whether they do or not, it depends on the
coaching they get and the desire and drive they have.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though it's been barely six months since the Americans beat
Canada for the first-ever Olympic women's hockey gold, the
celebration is pretty much complete for U.S. women's coach Ben
Smith. Instead of trying to stay within the basking glow of the
gold, Smith already is focusing on this December's Three Nations
Cup in Finland, the world championships March, also in Finland, and
all the while steering toward the 2002 Olympic Winter Games in Salt
Lake City, which is the primary destination of this camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is Phase 1 of the process,'' Smith said while watching
one of the four 18-player groups practice Tuesday morning. ``The
thing that catches my eye is that we've got a group here where no
one seems like they're out of place. Now, it's just a question of
what kind of growth physically they have. They've got a three-year
tunnel and we'll see who comes out of that tunnel ready to help the
next program.''
</P>
<P>
   The talent pool is more populous now than ever, mainly because
of the emergence of young women players. USA Hockey, the national
governing body, had only 153 registered girls teams nationwide nine
years ago, and less than 500 five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Now, there are well more than 1,000 registered teams, and more
than 27,000 girls players, compared to 5,533 in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   What that means is from the smallest grassroots level to the
national team, there are more, and better, players to choose from,
and the bar is being raised considerably each year, it seems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've worked at these USA camps since they started in 1991,''
said Laura Halldorson, the women's hockey coach at the University
of Minnesota. ``It really has been incredible, not only the
increase in talent but the increase in depth. Any of these young
teams could beat probably any of the national teams from back
then.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a bunch of players here that could be there in 2002,''
said goaltender Sara DeCosta, one of four players at the festival
who played for Team USA in Nagano, along with Angela Ruggerio,
Jenny Schmidgall and Mleczko. ``We're climbing the mountain at a
fast pace now. There's so many girls getting involved at such a
young age. Four years ago, there wasn't any way to have a camp with
72 players like this. No way.''
</P>
<P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The 72 players, all of whom are still college-eligible, were
chosen by a group of various coaches Smith contacted. Once the
invitees arrived in Lake Placid, they were broken down into four
teams of fairly equal ability, each consisting of two goaltenders,
six defensemen and 10 forwards. The age makeup of each team is
nearly exactly the same, as the four teams all have players ranging
from 18.8 to 19.5 years old on average.
</P>
<P>
   The format for the week-long player identification/development
event is a round-robin tournament, concluding with bronze- and
gold-medal matches on Saturday. Coaches from some of the top men's
and women's college programs are running the teams, while Smith
sits high atop the Olympic Center ice, watching and evaluating each
player.
</P>
<P>
   Yale men's hockey coach Tim Taylor coached one of the four
teams, and raved about the players all sharing one common bond.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have one agenda and one agenda only, and that's to be
better players,'' Taylor said. ``They are terrific to work with.''
</P>
<P>
   The first-timers appear to make the most of their opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone's a good player and it makes you play off of everyone
else,'' said Julie Chu, a 16-year-old sophomore at Choate Rosemary
Hall in Connecticut. ``You just have to play the moment. If you
don't play the moment, you're never going to get ahead.''

`54' WHERE ARE YOU? LATEST DISCO FILM SKIPS FUN, INSIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By AMY BIANCOLLI  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even a dim bulb can have a few bright flashes, and ``54'' has
two of them. One is Mike Meyers' spooky, tragicomic turn as Studio
54 owner-guru Steve Rubell. The other is Ryan Phillippe's pants.
</P>
<P>
   Let us explain. Phillippe plays a kid from Jersey who Talks Like
Dis but gets a job at the famed Manhattan discotheque by virtue of
his resemblance to Renaissance artworks (``You have the body of
David and the face of a Botticelli,'' purrs one admirer). After
spending nine-tenths of the action in satin jogging shorts, he
appears near the film's close in a pair of denim jeans ringed, at
bottom, by extraordinary furry white pant cuffs. The cuffs are
ravishing _ they seem to borrow DNA from Kris Kringle and a large
angora and they give the movie a welcome dose of unadorned
seventies nostalgia.
</P>
<P>
   It's a moment of pure pop charm in a film that boasts, by and
large, all the thrill of polyester.
</P>
<P>
   Weird, isn't it? You'd think, wouldn't you, that the iconic '70s
nightclub, replete with glamour and glitter and sundry sordid
goings-on, would be a rich subject for a film. At the very least it
ought to be entertaining.
</P>
<P>
   The genius of Paul Thomas Anderson's ``Boogie Nights'' wasn't
just the intensity of the drama or the giddiness of its late-1970s
soundtrack it was the width of the bell-bottoms, the dorkiness of
the haircuts and the repulsive puce of Mark Wahlberg's velvet suit.
</P>
<P>
   Disco-era films are fashionable right now (``The Ice Storm,''
``The Last Days of Disco,'' the upcoming ``Slums of Beverly
Hills''), and for good reason: The Me Decade was plump with
pop-cultural tidbits.
</P>
<P>
   While ``54'' dances to a thudding disco soundtrack, it misses
the point of all that gyrating; there's little humor, no irony, no
gaze at the era through a shiny cinematic snow-dome. And there's no
fun.
</P>
<P>
   Writer-director Mark Christopher makes several fatal errors with
his feature-film debut. One is his shift of emphasis away from
Rubell, a drug-addicted, Svengali-like figure with dreams of an
endless party. Meyers is terrific; he's a control freak desperate
for love, a man consumed by his own insatiable needs. When he's on
screen, the film's worth watching.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Christopher focuses the film on Phillippe's character, an
adorable but bloodless innocent named Shane O'Shea. It's an old
trick, sending a fresh young thing into a den of iniquity, but here
it backfires. As he bumps and grinds among the nude, the near-nude,
the painted, the famous (Truman! Andy!) and the guys dressed like
Roman gladiators, the viewer yearns to spend more time with them
and less with the dull boy preening on the dance floor.
</P>
<P>
   Furry-cuffed jeans or no furry-cuffed jeans, Shane is just way
too dull for Studio 54.
</P>
<P>
   His friends aren't much better. Salma Hayek throws off sparks as
a fiery singer and 54 employee, and Breckin Meyer brings surprising
moral weight to his performance as her virtuous husband but the
other supporting players gasp in airless roles. Michael York and
Lauren Hutton appear in pointless wee parts as high-class snobs.
Neve Campbell, as a soap star and disco habitue, is flat as a
cracker. Sherry Stringfield, nearly unrecognizable behind a Farrah
Fawcett flip, has a minuscule role as the night club's accountant.
And Ellen Albertini Dow, last seen as the rapping granny in ``The
Wedding Singer,'' is reduced to snorting coke in ``54.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the film suffers from Shane's dullsville voice-over
(``bartending was the best job in the world''), which opens the
film, closes it and pops up periodically like a large zit. If
nothing else, may ``54'' mark an end to droning narrators.

NATIVE AMERICANS DIVIDED OVER STATE PARK PROPOSAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES M. ODATO  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ A confederacy of Native American tribes is
divided over a proposed state park along the Hudson River, with one
representative of the group calling it insensitive and offensive,
while members of a Wisconsin-based tribe that helped develop the
plan say they support it.
</P>
<P>
   John Sam Sapiel, acting director of the Muhheconnew National
Confederacy Bureau of Political Affairs, said Thursday the proposal
for the new 1,358-acre Schodack Island State Park needs agreement
from eight tribes.
</P>
<P>
   Sapiel disclosed letters of opposition he and other tribal
leaders sent to New York Gov. George Pataki this summer. Chiefs of
at least two of the eight tribes of the confederacy wrote similar
letters to Pataki, one as recently as last week.
</P>
<P>
   However, disagreement among the tribes is evident.
</P>
<P>
   A key band of Indians who descended from the Mohicans who lived
on Schodack Island during Colonial times supports the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tribe has not ever adopted a resolution in opposition to
the development of that island,'' said Gary Ehman, a spokesman for
the Stockbridge-Munsee Band of Mohican Tribe, in Bowler, Wis.
</P>
<P>
   The Stockbridge band, which is one of the eight tribes of the
Muhheconnew confederacy, has been involved in developing the master
plan. The other tribes appear to have been left out.
</P>
<P>
   The master plan, dated Aug. 5, responds to a number of the
concerns Sapiel raised in his June 25 letter to Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Sapiel complained that the state plans a parking
lot, toilets and camp sites in the center of the island capital of
an Indian confederacy.
</P>
<P>
   The master plan says the facilities will be developed on areas
that were once underwater or areas with ``limited cultural
sensitivity.'' However, Sapiel, who says he has not read the master
plan, still insists that the project not go ahead as scheduled, as
he opposes any development on or near the capital of the Mohican
tribe.
</P>
<P>
   He said the eight tribes have a stake in the island because it
once was the seat of the confederacy's council fire, a gathering of
the various bands.
</P>
<P>
   Sapiel also notes that the confederacy helped repel French and
English attempts at colonization until illness cut the population
at the turn of the 18th century.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 13, Pataki announced completion of the master plan. He
said it would create ``a spectacular new state park.''
</P>
<P>
   The park, with seven miles of shoreline, is the site where Henry
Hudson moored the Half Moon in 1609 and went ashore to visit an
Indian chief, according to state records.
</P>
<P>
   Schodack Island, technically a peninsula, is scheduled to become
accessible to the general public with the creation of a bridge over
railroad tracks bordering the river near Schodack Landing.
</P>
<P>
   The park is to have a camping loop with toilets, canoe and kayak
access onto Schodack Creek and a Native American interpretive area,
the state says.
</P>
<P>
   New York Parks Commissioner Bernadette Castro responded
incredulously to Sapiel's point of view because of the substantial
work she said her office conducted to make sure the island's
development respected the wishes of Mohicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We carefully selected land which was felt to be not
significant,'' Castro said.
</P>
<P>
   Further, the office's archaeologist, Robert Kuhn, said he had
reviewed Sapiel's letter and said each point was addressed in the
final master plan. ``I'm not sure we agree with them,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are proceeding with the project,'' he said. ``We do feel
the project's worthwhile and has tremendous public benefit and
we've taken into consideration issues raised by Native Americans.''

MAN WITH NO PLAN FILLS THE NATION'S AIRWAVES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK McGUIRE  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Tom Leykis has no clue what he is doing.
</P>
<P>
   It's minutes before he goes on the air, where Leykis will impart
his usual mix of core beliefs and insights and whatever else he can
think of to a coast-to-coast radio audience. This is national,
baby, high-tech, high-minded entertainment. The man is a
professional.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keep in mind that at this moment I have no idea what I'm going
to talk about,'' Leykis says while walking casually toward the
studio of Albany station WGY-AM, from where the Los Angeles-based
host did his show one recent night.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow he knows he'll make it work. It usually does.
</P>
<P>
   Literally seconds before air time Leykis _ in a baseball cap,
shorts, patterned shirt and shades _ hits upon a topic for the
first hour of his four-hour show: a man suing his ex-fiance for not
returning a $31,940 engagement ring. So it will go for the second
hour, and the third and fourth. Need a topic in five seconds ...
hmmm, let's try this.
</P>
<P>
   He said his prep work comes from living and a life in radio,
providing him all the background he needs. He is pragmatic rather
than dogmatic, making him tough to pigeonhole but easy to enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   Each day, his nighttime live talk show begins with the song
``Enter Sandman'' by the heavy metal band Metallica, and the
42-year-old does bring a rock edge to his daily rants/observations.
But the show itself is more like jazz, free-form and unpredictable.
The audience doesn't know where it is going to go because Leykis
doesn't know where it is going to go. He calls it keeping it fresh.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Tom Leykis Show'' is a misnomer. A show _ his goes out to
about 175 radio stations over Westwood One Radio network _ usually
has a script, some order, a rough sketch of a plan. But those are
rules, and Leykis hates rules. He takes the show where the
conversation takes him. For four hours a big microphone eavesdrops
on his conversations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a slice of me,'' Leykis explained before going on the
air. ``It is the part of me people find the most interesting.
Fortunately for me, very few people are themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   So who is Tom Leykis? He is smart. And infantile. And insightful
and uncouth. A small ``l'' liberal who leans toward the libertarian
side, he can be in his depth talking about national policy issues.
It's just that sex is so much more interesting.
</P>
<P>
   On air, off air, it's the same person. There is no character
named Tom Leykis, just the person. Listeners, mostly young, like
him because he takes on topics as varying as relationships and
baseball and politics and, or course, sex, without any academic
artifice. He is the guy next you at a bar who happens to have a
radio show _ and an opinion on everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always saying exactly what I think,'' Leykis said. And it
can be mean. He has gone after fellow talk-show host Dr. Laura
Schlessinger with a vengeance. And arguing with Leykis is a bad
idea; a skilled debater at home on the air, he will probably carve
you up.
</P>
<P>
   Leykis also knows when to shut up, a rare talent in radio. He
hooks up Lisa and Bob, two callers from California, and let them
argue on whether live-in girlfriends should give their partner an
ultimatum to get married. Leykis _ who for the past seven years has
been on wife No. 4 _ stands back and occasionally giggles as the
callers take over the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``You like that when they forget they are on the radio,'' he
says off-air.
</P>
<P>
   Leykis has made many stops in his 19-year career, and one of the
most important may have been at the old WQBK-AM in Albany for a
couple of years back in the early 1980s. It was here where Leykis
began formulating the idea for a radio show. He was told to be
himself. He liked the idea. He went national in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Leykis has no plans to be an old man working at a local station
when his fame wanes.
</P>
<P>
   ``When there is no demand for what I'm doing, I will leave with
dignity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like a plan. Which doesn't sound like Leykis.

`SLUMS' A NICE COMING-OF-AGE-COMEDY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BARBARA SHULGASSER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tamara Jenkins tells a fairy-tale story of how Robert Redford
expressed admiration for her screenplay for ``Slums of Beverly
Hills'' when she was participating in a Sundance Directors' Lab.
Soon after, Redford's production company, South Fork, was courting
her.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, Redford's confidence in her talent was justified.
Her first feature, a semi-autobiographical coming-of-age comedy, is
a nicely directed, well-written debut. And it didn't hurt that
Jenkins, with the weight of Redford's support, was able to persuade
such pros as Alan Arkin, Carl Reiner, Jessica Walter and others to
bring her script to life.
</P>
<P>
   Arkin plays Murray Abramowitz, a divorced 65-year-old father of
three who despite being a notorious ne'er-do-well, somehow managed
to end up with the kids while the ex-wife got the house back east.
</P>
<P>
   It's 1976 and with no visible means of support, Murray, a man
with an avowed gambling problem, moves his brood to a series of
cramped one-bedroom apartments in the low-rent outskirts of Beverly
Hills. The apartments are short on cleanliness and furniture,
places he has no qualms about leaving in the middle of the night
without paying the rent.
</P>
<P>
   He dedicates himself to all of this maneuvering so the kids can
go to the district's good schools. ``Furniture is temporary,'' he
tells them. ``Education is forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Vivian (Natasha Lyonne) is about to enter high school while
coping with the frequent moves, her father's dire financial
situation and the sudden emergence of her ample breasts, which _ we
see first-hand _ finally need to be contained by mechanical
support. (``You're a perfect C,'' the brassiere saleswoman sings to
the embarrassed Viv.)
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins captures the difficulty of family dynamics as she
documents the interplay between Viv and her self-centered older
brother Ben (David Krumholtz) and between Murray and his wealthy
brother Mickey (Carl Reiner), who has been supporting Murray and
the kids for years mostly, it seems, so he can humiliate Murray in
front of his children.
</P>
<P>
   Lyonne displays the right mix of adolescent ennui and shame plus
intelligence and talent. Standout performances are also given by
Arkin, and by Marisa Tomei, who plays Mickey's drugged-out
daughter, Rita.
</P>
<P>
   When Rita escapes her rehab center and heads for Uncle Murray's
for solace, Murray negotiates a deal whereby he'll take care of the
wayward Rita if Mickey pays for the family to move into better
digs.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins takes the pathos and the sadness and shapes it into
appealing comedy. I can't wait for her next movie.

BASSES VS. THE KID: `SUNDANCE' SQUARE-OFF ENDS AMICABLY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LAURA VOZZELLA 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ A showdown between the Sundance Kid and the
Bass gang has ended in a bloodless draw.
</P>
<P>
   Since last year, Robert Redford and Fort Worth's Bass family
have been wrangling over use of the name ``Sundance'' for movie
theaters. The end came this week, when the Kid agreed to ride off
into the sunset.
</P>
<P>
   Redford, who portrayed the Wild West outlaw in the 1969 film
``Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,'' uses the name on his
Utah-based Sundance Enterprises, Sundance Film Festival and
Sundance Institute. With plans to add a chain of art-house cinemas
to the Sundance stable, Redford learned last year that the Basses
had already plastered the name on movie houses in Fort Worth's
Sundance Square.
</P>
<P>
   The Kid was up in arms. His posse of lawyers fired off letters
telling AMC's Sundance 11 and Sundance Palace 9 theaters to drop
the Sundance name.
</P>
<P>
   The Basses dragged the shootout into U.S. District Court in Fort
Worth in December. They asked a judge to declare them rightful
owners of the name.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides claimed first dibs.
</P>
<P>
   Redford, linked to the name by movie fans for nearly three
decades, started his Sundance Institute in 1980 after buying up
thousands of acres in Park City, Utah.
</P>
<P>
   But Fort Worth had the real Sundance Kid, Harry Longabaugh, who
whooped it up in Cowtown brothels and saloons with a gang of
outlaws called the Wild Bunch in the 1880s. The Basses claimed they
had used the terms Sundance Square and Sundance continuously in
Texas at least since 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow _ neither side would explain Thursday _ the parties came
to an agreement, finalized Wednesday by U.S. District Judge John
McBryde.
</P>
<P>
   The Basses retain the right to use the name Sundance on movie
theaters in Tarrant and 10 surrounding Texas counties, along with
Love and Carter counties in Oklahoma. Redford's Sundance
Enterprises may use the name on movie theaters anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really what we wanted,'' said Wesley Harris, an
attorney for the Basses' Sundance Square. ``And I guess they
decided it would work for them, too.''

FORMER BU STUDENT SUES OVER 1995 ASSAULT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ZACHARY R. DOWDY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It was Rush Week in October of 1995 when Jessica
Smithers, a Boston University freshman, and her friends set out to
a party at BU's fraternity mecca near West Campus.
</P>
<P>
   At 17, Smithers was intrigued by the bottomless kegs of beer,
loud music, and dirty dancing in dark, steamy rooms.
</P>
<P>
   She also was drawn to a burly senior who beckoned her to an
after-hours bash at a Gardner Street fraternity and dutifully
freshened her spiked punch drink.
</P>
<P>
   But, she said, he later turned violent, raping her in a frat
house as she, intoxicated , weakly put up a fight.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Smithers has begun the process of suing BU for $3 million,
hoping to hold the college responsible for the actions of its
students and unruly fraternities. At issue _ for BU and,
potentially, other universities _ is whether a college can
advertise the benefits of Greek life and also legally distance
itself from wanton frat behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Smithers's lawyer, Timothy Corcoran, wrote President Jon
Westling letter in November, claiming BU failed to warn and protect
her _ by policing parties, for example, from fraternity life's
seamy underside: binge drinking and sexual assaults.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want the asset without the liability,'' Corcoran said.
</P>
<P>
   While BU officials do not contest Smithers's account of her
alleged rape, they claim they are not liable because the rape
occurred off campus and because the fraternity was not even
recognized by BU.
</P>
<P>
   Herbert A. Ross, BU's dean of students, said BU does not own or
lease fraternity houses and is not responsible for lax security in
buildings housing students off campus, such as the one where
Smithers allegedly was raped.
</P>
<P>
   Corcoran, however, compared the case to that of a party host or
a tavern owner being held liable for tragedies if they are linked
to alcohol consumed on the host's premises. And he said BU's
responsibility doesn't end at its geographical boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``BU has an affirmative duty to look out for the safety and
security of its students and to protect them from all forseeable
risks,'' said Stephen Hennessy, another Smithers attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Ross, the BU dean, said that the university swiftly investigated
and suspended the student who was accused of rape after he was
found responsible in campus court.
</P>
<P>
   He said that had the rape taken place in a BU building, the
school might bear financial responsibility, as in the case of a
Pine Manor College student who was raped in December of 1977 by an
intruder who slipped through campus security.
</P>
<P>
   But Smithers' attorneys said, also, that BU knew the assailant
had a history of sexual assault from a prior incident when he
allegedly restrained an intoxicated woman and told BU police she
lived at the building to prevent her from leaving.
</P>
<P>
   Ross, however, insisted that ``We had no prior knowledge of a
sexual assault attempt by the student.''
</P>
<P>
   He said students learn the dangers of alcohol and sexual assault
at orientation, and via reading materials, workshops, and Rape
Awareness Week programs in the first weeks of school.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tragedy that this happened,'' Ross added. ``But the
majority of our fraternities are not problematic.''
</P>
<P>
   Smithers's alleged ordeal is not uncommon on campus. The
Chronicle of Higher Education reported in May that between 1995 and
1996 reported rapes on 487 campuses with 5,000 or more students
jumped 14.8 percent, from 1,013 to 1,161.
</P>
<P>
   But Smithers, a 20-year-old environmental studies major and
honor student at George Washington University, is not a typical
victim if only because she is speaking out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never had a clear understanding of sexual assault until it
happened to me,'' said Smithers, who transfered to GW after her
allegedly traumatic experience at BU. ``I had no idea how
life-changing it is. If I can prevent one woman from having to go
through it I'd feel so much better.''
</P>
<P>
   Smithers said the assailant met her and her friends when they
stopped by Sigma Phi Epsilon's Linden Street house at about 11 p.m.
on Oct. 7, 1995 to ask for directions to a party being held by
another fraternity. The assailant invited them to an after-hours
party later on.
</P>
<P>
   Hours later, Smithers and her group stopped by the after-hours
bash. She said the alleged assailant kept her by his side, leaving
her only for more punch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was taken in by the scene,'' she said. ``I felt impressed
and good. I didn't think anything bad was going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   By 3 a.m., Smithers got sick, and the group hailed taxis on
Commonwealth Avenue. In the confusion, Smithers was left behind
with the student, who had scribbled his phone number on a bank
statement. That paper was used at the campus court when he claimed
he never met Smithers.
</P>
<P>
   Smithers said he urged her to go back to Sigma Phi Epsilon. She
had no taxi money to get to her room in Kenmore Square, and the T
had stopped running, as did BU's escort service.
</P>
<P>
   She said she went back to the fraternity and locked herself in
the bathroom. But he barged in and told her to sleep on his futon.
She fell asleep but remembers half-waking and performing oral sex.
Dazed, she tried to fight but her body felt weak.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt really incapacitated,'' she said. ``It was almost like
seeing what was happening to me but not being able to do anything
about it. I couldn't stop it.''

DANGER FOR US AS WORLD ECONOMIC CRISIS WORSENS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In Maine they tell the story of four hunters who every deer
season hire the same float plane to fly them into the north country
camp where everyone always gets their buck.
</P>
<P>
   Last season was no different: four hunters, four deer. But when
the pilot returned, he shook his head: I can't ferry you all out in
one trip, with those heavy deer carcasses too. They complained, he
resisted; they cajoled, he wavered; they threatened, he caved.
</P>
<P>
   Load 'em all up, he shrugged, we'll give it a go. They taxied
across the lake, he gunned it, up they went, weaving and wobbling.
After five minutes of flight, down they came. After the smoke
cleared, and they crawled from the wreckage, one hunter asked:
``Where are we?'' The pilot, still groggy, took his bearings, and
proclaimed: ``Looks like we're only about 100 yards from where we
all crashed last year.''
</P>
<P>
   That is a story about not making the same mistake over and over
again. Which is a tendency of all mankind. And what brings it to
mind is the sound of the ruble collapsing as Russia's currency,
banking, and political systems crash.
</P>
<P>
   Pile Russia's paralysis atop Japan's nosedive, the wider Asian
``depression,'' as financial writers have begun to label it, and
the persistent inability of the bulk of African countries to grow
their economies, and the ``globalization'' that fired US economic
growth turns into a two-way trip.
</P>
<P>
   That escalator that Americans rode up is suddenly thrown into
reverse. It goes down as well as up. And down is not good for Mr.
Dow, Mr. Jones, or Mr. and Mrs. North America. The intricate
network of arteries and veins that carried US goods abroad and
brought foreign goods here was like the human body's circulatory
system. Our economy grew strong and healthy and developed a vast
appetite for more.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, people in Thailand stopped buying pickup trucks.
Indonesia's corrupt political system cracked and fell apart.
Japan's banking structure turned out to be rotten with
uncollectible loans. The equally rotten Japanese political system
is still unable to put meaningful reforms in place.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese economy's eight percent growth rate target is
receding amid floods and anticipated layoffs of ``tens of
millions'' of workers from inefficient government-owned
enterprises, National Public Radio warned yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   All the kinds of stuff we sold to the Pacific rim piles up on US
docks or sits in cartons in US warehouses. Our
96-percent-of-capacity employment picture is punctured by layoffs
in industry after industry. Deflation stares us in the face _
factories can't sell stuff for the price they used to get, so
manufacturers have to cut prices or eat what they produce.
</P>
<P>
   You can't sell what people won't buy. And consumers in Japan,
Asia, and now Russia, are not buying as they used to. Globalization
can take our economy down as well as up. It appears today that the
broad economic expansion that began in the early '90s is not going
to last the decade.
</P>
<P>
   This changes a lot of things for everybody. Millions of
Americans will be in danger of being laid off, fired, forced into
early retirement, downsized, or otherwise diminished in their
earning capacity. The vast middle class who have stuffed payroll
deductions into mutual funds and 401(k) plans will have to swallow
investment losses after the fat years of double-digit increases.
</P>
<P>
   The anticipated economic slowdown has yet to impact the
political system here. The US throttle is still wide open. Housing
starts, hiring plans, and discretionary income show Americans are
still spending. But that could slow dramatically by November. Our
off-year elections could be held in an atmosphere of chaotic
foreign economic news, sharply declining consumer confidence, and
the disappearance of the comfort zone that has bathed incumbent
politicians of both parties.
</P>
<P>
   What happens to Clinton when the public gets antsy, then ornery?
What happens to Newt Gingrich's 11-seat majority in the US House?
What about the media weather, the context in which election choices
will be framed? We can only guess. The next 10 weeks can serve up a
lot of lousy economic news. Will voters react? Some will. Enough to
change results? Who knows?
</P>
<P>
   For starters, the media musings about Monica, her dress, her
twitterings to Kenneth Starr, and the let's-impeach-Clinton mob
will perforce diminish. Recession is not a pleasant topic for
anyone, but if Clinton has shown anything in six years, he's proven
he can convince the majority of folks he is on their side on
economic issues.
</P>
<P>
   I still think it will take a sharp economic downturn before the
US House returns to Democratic control. Not this time, I'm
thinking. Voters have been too fat for too long to turn on a dime.
Clinton's hairsplitting on just what constitutes ``sexual relations
with that woman, Ms. Lewinsky,'' will not help.
</P>
<P>
   But then you can usually count on enough Republicans to go
berserk, by shutting down the government, or demanding Clinton's
impeachment, to turn people off. The GOP's Krazy Konservatives
remind me of that bush pilot who keeps overloading the float plane:
``Hey, maybe this time it'll work.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (David Nyhan is a Globe columnist who for the life of him can't
recall where he first heard that bush pilot yarn.)

JACKSON HAS HAD BEST SEAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD MANLY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABC's Keith Jackson has set the standard for college football
announcers over the last three decades, his voice unable to hide
his Southern roots. He still calls linemen ``Big Ugly,'' fast
receivers ``burners,'' and passes ``hummers.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``Whoa Nellie'' is his trademark, an expression he uses to
convey excitement, a sudden turn in the action, or a spectacular
play. Jackson doesn't remember when he started using those words.
He does, however, recall being told by one of his mentors not to be
afraid to turn a phrase ``if it was explanatory, had some flavor
and color, and helped people understand and enjoy the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson plans to retire after this season, but not before he
calls the Rose Bowl _ his favorite postseason game _ on Jan. 1 and
the Fiesta Bowl Jan. 4, where the top-ranked team will play No. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson has been outspoken about what he views as the
commercialization of college football, and he concedes television
has played a major role.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started it,'' he said. ``Newspapers didn't bring that money
to the table, television did. And that has always been my problem.
I'm not a journalist. It's a simple thing. When ABC spends half a
billion dollars on something, I'm not going to rip and tear it
apart. We got ourselves in this particular fix.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson still has a passion for the game, the pageantry, the
marching bands and tailgating, and in some cases entire states
rooting and cheering, lives linked with their team's fortunes on
the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not my stage,'' he said. ``The stage belongs to the
athletes and coaches who play the game. People don't throw down
1,000 bucks for a TV to hear me talk.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson boasts he has seen some of the greatest games in college
football history. He rattled off a couple: the 1967 USC-UCLA games
when O.J. Simpson had two great touchdown runs and UCLA quarterback
Gary Beban went on to earn the Heisman Trophy; the 1979 Sugar Bowl
game between Penn State and Alabama when most believed the Crimson
Tide's goal-line stand in the fourth quarter was the deciding
factor. It wasn't, however, because on the next series Alabama was
forced to punt and its punter shanked a 27-yarder. But Penn State
had 12 men on the field and the punter got another kick, this time
booming it for 53 yards _ Whoa Nellie _ preventing the Nittany
Lions from getting close to the end zone again.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, 71, is a storyteller, able to bring viewers back in
time. He called his first college game at Washington State in 1958
for the college radio station and has collected stories ever since.
He is a Southern boy at heart, born near the Georgia-Alabama line.
He left home when he was 16 and lied about his age to join the
Marines for four years in 1946. He then enrolled at Washington
State.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson originally wanted to become a police officer but the
broadcasting bug hit him hard. He has had a ball, and still
believes in the purity of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think we've got a grand old game,'' he told the New
Orleans Times-Picayune last year. ``I don't think we've got to bury
it for the sake of a dollar. Oh yes, the dollar. The old buck is
what's pulling the wagon everywhere. But I'm sure they will work
that out.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson has met all of the greats along the way. Joe Paterno.
Bear Bryant. Johnny Rodgers.
</P>
<P>
   One of his favorite stories involves Frank Howard, the former
athletic director at Clemson. Jackson was working the Clemson game
against Duke in 1966, and Clemson's campus is near a lake where
students wanted to start a crew team.
</P>
<P>
   Now Jackson knew a little about crew, having made the first live
radio broadcast (1958) of a sporting event (crew) from the Soviet
Union to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   So Jackson was talking with Howard and asked why he didn't want
to start a crew team at Clemson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ain't nobody going to spend my money sitting on their ass
going backwards.''

A SUMMER OF DISCONTENT IN JOURNALISM. 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A specter is haunting American journalism. The specter of
fairness.
</P>
<P>
   The standard-bearer for the new Miss Prissyfingers school of
reporting is Steven Brill's Content, the new journalism ``review''
that has already succeeded in its primary mission: getting itself
written about by other journalists.
</P>
<P>
   Let me tell you about two interesting items I read in the
September issue before I threw it across the room. There's a funny
parody of the entire Brill endeavor by Calvin Trillin, and, much as
it pains me to admit it, egomaniacal windbag James Cramer's article
on the death of the Wall Street Journal's ``Heard on the Street''
column was excellent. I'm sure Brillyfingers would want me to
disclose that the magazine also has an unflattering (if incoherent)
article on the recent travails at the Globe.
</P>
<P>
   I just couldn't stand the cover story on Bill Gates. Reason A:
Content has dug up a December 1977 New Mexico police mug shot of
Bill G. under arrest. The magazine convinced me that Gates has not
told the truth about the incident, and mentions that the arrest
file ``is nowhere to be found'' in Albuquerque Police Department
records. Huh?
</P>
<P>
   But for some reason Content insists that Gates was hauled in on
``a probably minor but still unknown charge.'' Huh? Yes, Gates has
copped to some speeding tickets, and was arrested in 1989 on
suspicion of DWI. But how do we know that the New Mexico arrest
wasn't, say, a drug-related misdemeanor, or a weapons charge? We
don't. Yet Content undermines its own writer's excellent reporting
with speculation that Gates was taken in on a ``probably minor
charge.''
</P>
<P>
   Reason B: Content writer Elizabeth Stevens carefully describes
Microsoft's notorious ``Astroturf'' plan to use regional public
relations firms to generate ``objective,'' third-party media
coverage favorable to M/s. She quotes an anonymous P.R. executive
(Anonymous source! Big no-no in Prissyville!) involved in the
scheme to the effect that M/s's P.R. firm, Edelman Worldwide, would
pay the local companies so they could truthfully say they weren't
working for Microsoft. Fine. But then we have to read this
duplicitous statement from Microsoft's in-house flack, Mich
Mathews: ``It's plainly inaccurate to suggest any firm retained by
Microsoft would not identify itself as working for Microsoft.''
</P>
<P>
   My point? Read carefully, Mathews' statement is a Clintonian
masterpiece of non-denial. (``He was never alone in a hotel with
Paula Jones.'') So why quote her? Answer: to be fair.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
FOOTNOTE TO HISTORY
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There is one aspect of the now-tiresome ``Wag the
Dog''-is-really-about-Bill-Clinton scenario that has not been fully
appreciated. ``Wag the Dog'' is based on a superb novel by Larry
Beinhart called ``American Hero.'' Beinhart's book is a
``non-fiction'' novel. His phony war is the Persian Gulf War, and
the men behind the curtain are George Bush and his aide James
Baker.
</P>
<P>
   So how did ``Dog's'' anti-Bush pedigree become a by-the-numbers
blueprint for Clinton-bashing? (In the movie, the president
provokes a war with Albania to distract attention from a sexual
dalliance with a Girl Scout.) The plot sprang whole, it seems, from
the fertile mind of Newton's Own David Mamet.
</P>
<P>
   Following a furious fur fight with the Screen Writers Guild,
Mamet received only second credit for ``Wag,'' after Hilary Henkin,
who adapted the Beinhart novel for the screen. But given that Mamet
never read Beinhart's book nor Henkin's script, it seems that
column hacks and editorial jockeys across the country have the
mercurial playwright to thank for the endless stream of
life-imitates-fiction bleatings of recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
SHOVED ASIDE
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One casualty of this week's Boston Herald redesign seems to be
the jumpy Herald newsboy, who used to be seen sprinting across the
top of the tabloid's front page, necktie flopped back over his
shoulder, eagerly hawking our crosstown rival.
</P>
<P>
   The image was a needlepoint contribution from the mother of
Robert Choate, who ran the Herald in the 1940s. The original
newsboy carried the original Herald, a broad sheet (wide-format)
like the Globe. When the Herald became a tabloid, the little runner
started brandishing the smaller paper, and since Monday's redesign,
he's selling the nouveau Herald. That's right. Unlike his
flesh-and-blood counterparts, the Herald newsboy hasn't vanished.
He's now scrunched in above the second-page index, and above the
editorial page, far from prying eyes.

REAL EYE OF THE STORM ISN'T BONNIE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hurricane Bonnie shows how fortunate Americans are. No other
nation has the media and meteorological resources to produce a
storm before the storm, raining down infrared, color-enhanced
satellite photographs of Bonnie, graphics of its path, and map
after map of the landfall zone.
</P>
<P>
   No other nation has the army of talking heads to babble in
higher and higher pitches as Bonnie's winds went from 50 to 70 to
115 miles per hour. By the time Bonnie came ashore on Wednesday,
the proclamation by a CNN reporter that ``She's big and bad'' was
an anticlimax. Anyone with any sense had left the most threatened
areas of the North Carolina coast. By landfall, camera shots made
it seem that reporters outnumbered residents.
</P>
<P>
   One way of looking at it, and a totally legitimate one, is that
the media coverage did its job. Lives were surely saved by
evacuations and property damage surely was lessened by people who
battened down the hatches and brought their boats to safe harbor.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a self-absorption about the hype that makes us
forget that it is our wealth that permits us to treat a hurricane
almost as entertainment. Between our satellite tracking, our
well-paved evacuation routes and sturdy housing stock, Americans
have dramatically reduced the chances of dying in hurricanes.
</P>
<P>
   Gone, probably, are the days of 1900 when an unannounced
hurricane killed between 6,000 and 12,000 people in Galveston,
Texas. Or even 1928 when a hurricane in central Florida killed
1,836 people. It would probably be considered a national disaster
if fatalities reached the 259 of Hurricane Camille in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   Americans now have the luxury of thinking about storms more in
terms of material property. Hurricane Andrew killed only 26 people
even thought it was America's most costly hurricane, causing $30
billion of damage in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   That is a luxury still unknown to much of the world's
population. As Americans sat by the Weather Channel, Bangladesh,
with almost no coverage from the American press, is screaming for
international help. Between 20 million and 30 million people, or
between the equivalent of the populations of Texas and California
are homeless and over 400 have died as a result of floods triggered
by monsoons.
</P>
<P>
   In China, at least 3,000 people have been killed, 5 million
houses have been destroyed and at least 223 million people, the
equivalent of 85 percent of the population of the United States,
have been affected by the worst floods in 44 years. The Chinese
government has dispatched 178,000 troops to guard dikes that
protect millions of people from further disaster.
</P>
<P>
   China, it could be argued to some degree, has itself to blame
for some of the flood damage, by allowing heavy deforestation in
pursuit of development and not investing in strong dikes. But
Bangladesh, too poor to afford housing to withstand water and wind,
and unable to afford reliable roads, is always ripe for disaster.
Besides the 400 who have died, more than 100,000 people are
suffering from intestinal illnesses from contaminated water.
</P>
<P>
   Bangladesh has asked for $681.5 million in emergency aid. As
Boston television stations sent their reporters to North Carolina
to stand in the wind _ with Channel 7 calling it a ``striptease''
that slowly revealed its power, Bangladesh's finance minister, Shah
Kibria, was saying halfway around the world, ``The current flood is
an economic disaster for Bangladesh.''
</P>
<P>
   While Boston's army of talking heads zeroed in on preparations
for Bonnie by the relatively relaxed rich on Nantucket _ which is
not likely to be hit with hurricane force winds _ President Jiang
Zemin of China issued an order that state media said was a
``do-or-die order for the troops to safeguard the dikes.''
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane Bonnie was, of course, serious business. But it seems
almost arrogant that Americans can watch hour after hour of Bonnie
coverage while relief teams in northeastern China are preparing to
dig semi-subterranean shelters for the homeless before the cold
nights of fall. It feels like two planets to see the rich debate
riding out the storm on their yachts while Bangladesh is in
desperate need of baby food and water purification tablets.
</P>
<P>
   As America watches Bonnie rotate on TV maps to the point of
hypnosis, it should consider the far greater suffering in
Bangladesh and China _ countries which we exploit for sneakers and
baseball caps. If we did, we might do ourselves two favors. One is,
we might be reminded of our privilege of national wealth. The other
is we might be more moved to share our weather, housing, and road
technology so hurricanes and monsoons do not cost hundreds of lives
abroad. Bangladesh and China couldn't care less about the Weather
Channel. They need someone to tune in, period.

WEST VIRGINIA, SYRACUSE ARE TWO FOR THE SHOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; When the curtain goes up on Sept. 5, West Virginia and
Syracuse will carry the Big East's tattered banner in the opening
week of the football season. The No. 12 Mountaineers host
top-ranked Ohio State and the No. 14 Orangemen host 10th-ranked
Tennessee in a pair of nationally televised marquee matchups.
</P>
<P>
   By season's end, many expect West Virginia and Syracuse to be
fighting for the conference title and the right to represent the
Big East in the new Bowl Championship Series. The Mountaineers were
picked to win the crown in a media poll, with Syracuse a very close
second in the balloting, 174 points to 172.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't get off to a good start last year and we won the
conference championship,'' said Syracuse coach Paul Pasqualoni,
responding to a question about his team's notorious habit of
stumbling out of the blocks. ``We didn't get off to a good start
the year before and we ended well, so to me it's a heck of a lot
more important how you end the season than how you start.''
</P>
<P>
   It is imperative, though, that running back Amos Zereoue of West
Virginia and quarterback Donovan McNabb of Syracuse not stub their
toes at the start, lest their hopes for the Heisman Trophy suffer.
</P>
<P>
   But Zereoue, a 5-foot-10-inch, 200-pound junior who was third in
the nation last year with 150.5 rushing yards per game, said,
``This season is not about me winning the Heisman Trophy. It's
about my team winning the Big East championship and going to a
bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   That is McNabb's mission as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not playing for the Heisman,'' said McNabb, who passed for
2,488 yards and 20 touchdowns last season in leading Syracuse from
the depths of a 1-3 start to an 8-0 finish and the Big East title.
``I'm going to be playing for my team.''
</P>
<P>
   When McNabb and Zereoue meet on the field Nov. 7 in Morgantown,
W.Va., it'll be a head-on collision with the conference title
likely to be at stake.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a two-horse race,'' insisted West Virginia coach Don
Nehlen, whose team returns not only Zereoue but seven other
starters on offense and seven on defense from a squad that went 7-5
overall, 4-3 conference. ``How many teams are in our league? Eight
of us? It's an eight-team race. The bottom team can beat the top,
in my opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   While it remains to be seen whether Temple, which welcomes new
coach Bobby Wallace from Division 2 North Alabama, and Rutgers,
which hopes to rebound from an 0-11 season, will be up to the task,
the Big East on the whole does project to be stronger, even though
its teams went 0 for 4 in postseason play.
</P>
<P>
   Boston College, predicted to finish sixth after going 4-7, 3-4,
in Tom O'Brien's inaugural season as head coach, will be jockeying
with the likes of Miami, Virginia Tech, and possibly Pittsburgh for
postseason consideration.
</P>
<P>
   Miami, picked to finish third, is looking to get back to the
postseason after sitting home for only the second time in 15 years.
Coach Butch Davis will likely restore the 'Canes to full strength
with the return of 16 starters from a young squad.Senior QB Scott
Covington, who takes over for Ryan Clement, and junior Edgerrin
James, who rushed for 1,098 yards and set a conference record with
a 271-yard effort vs. BC, will pace Miami's offense, while seven
returning starters will solidify the defense.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Tech will field a younger squad, replacing 11 starters,
but has proven commodities in senior QB Al Clark and two of the
best kickers in the conference _ junior placekicker Shayne Graham
and junior punter Jimmy Kibble.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh undergos a serious overhaul after Walt Harris led the
Panthers to a stunning turnaround and their first bowl appearance
since 1989 in his first year at the helm. A new quarterback,
offensive line, and running back must be found.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the conference is going to be extremely tough this
year,'' said Pasqualoni, whose team might have the toughest
nonconference schedule in the country, with games against
Tennessee, at Michigan, at North Carolina State, and vs.
Cincinnati. ``West Virginia has a lot of good players coming back,
so they're going to be tough. Miami has got just excellent,
excellent speed, talent, and young players. Virginia Tech has an
excellent core of players coming back and Coach (Frank) Beamer has
maintained a high level of play at Virginia Tech. Walt (Harris) at
Pittsburgh and Tom O'Brien at BC have both elevated their programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You got Bobby Wallace at Temple, who's going to drive people
crazy with (quarterback) Kevin Harvey running that (option) offense
they're going to run; it's going to be tough on everybody. And
(Rutgers coach) Terry (Shea) finally has a quarterback (Mike
McMahon) who's been in the system a couple of years, so they're
going to be a better team.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I think the conference is going be a very, very tough
conference every single week.''

<P>
   August. Time for predictions about a season that will unfold
over the next 16 weeks:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
THE WHO'S NO. 1 ISSUE &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Take your pick. It looks like a wide-open race among Florida
State, Ohio State, Florida, Nebraska, and a handful of other teams.
Our best guess is a Florida State-Arizona State title game in the
Fiesta Bowl. But a sleeper such as Louisiana State or Kansas State
could emerge as well.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
THE BCS QUESTION &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That's Bowl Championship Series, which used to be the Bowl
Alliance. What's new is that the Rose Bowl is part of the BCS, as
are the Pacific-10 and Big Ten, which means we should have a true
national championship game. The BCS will include eight teams
(champions of the Big East, Southeastern, Atlantic Coast, Big 12,
Pac-10, and Big Ten conferences, plus two at-large slots), in the
Fiesta Bowl (Jan. 4, championship game), Rose Bowl, Orange Bowl,
and Sugar Bowl. No more of this business of polls as the only
criteria. Now we'll have the two polls, plus three computers
spitting out rankings based on wins, losses, strength of schedule,
and other data. It's an improvement, but we still have plenty of
room for controversy _ say, if we have three unbeaten teams or one
unbeaten team and five or six teams with one loss all trying to get
to the national championship game.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
GAMES TO WATCH &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sept. 5: Ohio State at West Virginia, Tennessee at Syracuse,
Michigan at Notre Dame, Washington at Arizona State. One of the
biggest first weeks ever.
</P>
<P>
   Sept. 19: Florida at Tennessee. It's a new era for Tennessee,
with QB Tee Martin attempting to do what Peyton Manning couldn't in
four tries: beat the Gators.
</P>
<P>
   Oct. 10: LSU at Florida. This could replace Florida-Tennessee as
the most important SEC rivalry.

<P>
   Nov. 14: Nebraska at Kansas State. The Wildcats haven't beaten
Nebraska since the '60s. If they want to be contenders instead of
pretenders, this is the year the streak (now at 29) must end.
</P>
<P>
   Nov. 21: Michigan at Ohio State. The Buckeyes are No. 1 in both
the AP and coaches' preseason polls. But unless they can find a way
to beat the Wolverines, they won't even be No. 1 in the Big Ten.
Also, Florida at Florida State. The winner has a good chance of
playing for the national title. Loser gets to say, ``Wait until
next year.'' Edge: FSU, because the game is in Tallahassee.
</P>
<P>
   Nov. 27: Arizona State at Arizona. A meaningful Pac-10 game in
November? It doesn't happen very often, but the conference is
strong this year, with UCLA and Arizona State both national title
contenders.
</P>
<P>

 &QL; 
THE HEISMAN WATCH &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Texas running back Ricky Williams is the front-runner, but will
the Longhorns be good enough to support his candidacy? No Heisman
winner has come from a team with two or more regular-season losses
since Brigham Young's Ty Detmer in 1990. Other contenders: UCLA QB
Cade McNown, West Virginia RB Amos Zereoue, Central Florida QB
Daunte Culpepper, Florida State QB Chris Weinke.

UPSETS, UPSETS &QL;

</P>
<P>
   They'll come early and often. Here's a couple to watch for right
out of the box: Louisiana Tech over Nebraska tomorrow and West
Virginia over Ohio State Sept. 5. If it goes 48-0 the other way in
both games, please disregard this.
</P>

   Wisconsin, Notre Dame, and Miami all could have very good
records very late in the season.

<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
THE BOSTON COLLEGE QUESTION &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   How about 7-4 with a bowl bid? Too optimistic? Maybe. But if the
Eagles can win at Georgia Tech Sept. 5, they could be on their way
to a winning season. Tom O'Brien has the Eagles pointed in the
right direction, and it's going to be 5-6, 6-5, or 7-4, depending
on luck as much as anything else.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
HOT SEATS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ohio State coach John Cooper is on one _ not in terms of job
security, but simply to beat Michigan. Alabama coach Doug DuBose,
too, simply because it's Alabama coming off a losing season. And
Rutgers coach Terry Shea, simply because the Knights look like the
worst team in the Big East again and unless there is a dramatic
turnaround, another change will have to be made.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
THE BIG EAST &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's improving. Syracuse is good, Miami should be back, and West
Virginia has to be great. We'll know a lot more after Sept. 5.

STORM SCENARIO FOR 2100: HAVOC FOR NEW ENGLAND COAST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT ALLEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   New England appears likely to dodge the worst of Hurricane
Bonnie, but if sea levels continue to rise as a result of global
warming, the destruction wrought by future storms could wipe out
many seaside oases, according to a sobering animation released
Thursday by an environmental research group.
</P>
<P>
   The video, produced by the National Environmental Trust,
suggests that a three-foot rise in sea level _ which could happen
within 100 years at projected rates _ would make the $1 billion in
damages from the last big hurricane to hit New England, Bob in
1991, seem trivial by comparison.
</P>
<P>
   Edgartown, Mass., where President Clinton sailed with Walter
Cronkite earlier this week, would be almost completely submerged
beneath the storm surge, while low-lying locations such as
Massachusetts' South Shore and Cape Cod would also be inundated,
causing massive erosion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's impossible to quantify in dollars and cents some of the
impacts of global warming,'' said George Abar, vice president of
the National Environmental Trust. ``But we're trying to show with
this report that it's not needed. It's a fool's errand ... to put a
dollar value on Nantucket.''
</P>
<P>
   Scientists agree that even a slight increase in air temperature
causes sea levels to rise as warming ocean waters gain volume from
melting glaciers and ice caps. Global sea levels have risen 4 to 10
inches over the past century, partly as a result of a 1 degree
Fahrenheit rise in average temperatures.
</P>
<P>
   A United Nations-backed panel of 2,000 scientists predicts that
the trend will accelerate over the next century, raising sea levels
another 10 to 37 inches if nothing is done to curb the release of
gases that cause heat to build up in the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, however, the focus in the sea-level debate has been
on the land that would be permanently inundated. The US
Environmental Protection Agency estimates that Massachusetts would
lose 250 square miles of dry coastal land, and much more beach and
wetland, if sea level rises just two feet, the agency's best guess
for the next century.
</P>
<P>
   The greater danger may come from extreme weather, including
category 2 hurricanes such as Bob that strike southern New England
about once a decade. In such a storm, the rise in sea levels would
be compounded by a storm surge that would make high tide 10 to 15
feet higher than usual.
</P>
<P>
   Even worse would be the 130 mile per hour winds of a category 3
hurricane, three of which struck New England from 1938 to 1954.
These devastating hurricanes deliver twice the storm surge of a
category 2 storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about massive flooding versus the kind of
isolated stuff we had with Hurricane Bob,'' which destroyed 32
houses, said David Vallee, hurricane program leader for the
National Weather Service in Taunton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The National Environmental Trust video, which deliberately
focused on tony Edgartown in hopes of getting the attention of
vacationing President Clinton, assumes that nothing is done to stop
global warming, and that coastal officials do not build seawalls or
other armor that would reduce the waves' effect.
</P>
<P>
   A three-foot sea-level rise would permanently inundate the
barrier beach that protects Edgartown as well as the northwest end
of Chappaquiddick Island, which protects Edgartown harbor. Many of
the elegant, expensive waterfront homes would be either flooded out
or placed in the direct path of ocean storms.
</P>
<P>
   During a category 2 storm, virtually all of the heavily
populated parts of Edgartown would be under water, leaving just a
few islands.
</P>
<P>
   Though dramatic, the predicted damage to Edgartown would be less
than at many other coastal locations that face the open Atlantic.
The town borders relatively sheltered Nantucket Sound, which is
nestled between the Vineyard, Cape Cod and Nantucket.
</P>
<P>
   Wesley Tiffney Jr., director of the University of Massachusetts
field station on Nantucket, said the worst damage would occur in
places such as Nantucket and parts of Cape Cod, sandy shores that
have no land mass between them and open ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Tiffney, one of several scientists who joined in releasing the
simulation, said erosion is already chipping away at the south and
east of Nantucket, where entire streets and parts of the
neighborhood of Siasconset have dropped into the sea.
</P>
<P>
   If sea levels rise three feet, said Tiffney, ``I would give
Nantucket 400 years'' before the island disappears.
</P>
<P>
   EPA regional administrator John DeVillars said the video should
spur the federal government to take action to prevent global
warming, thought to result from burning oil and coal as well as
other human activities that release carbon dioxide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of the areas and ways of life that define this part of
the country are imperiled by global warming,'' said DeVillars,
estimating that sea-level rise will erase 130 to 200 acres of New
England coast annually. ``We need to address the causes.''
</P>
<P>
   Abar of the National Environmental Trust, an environmental
research organization backed by the Pew Charitable Trusts, said
Congress has blocked efforts to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide,
with one member even attempting to prevent the EPA from holding
public meetings on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Leading Republicans in Congress continue to argue that fears of
global warming are exaggerated, and that the cost of reducing US
use of oil and coal would devastate the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a very one-sided debate ... There's very little
discussion of the cost of doing nothing,'' said Abar.

HOW TO BUILD A PROGRAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LINCOLN, Neb. _ Sheldon Jackson remembers the meeting. He
recalls the words, the feeling in the locker room. He was just a
redshirt freshman, a Southern California kid who had wound up here
among the children-of-the-corn fanatics known as Nebraska football
fans.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, a tight end who has worked his way into a starting role
after four years in the system, says it was Christian Peter,
Nebraska's former All-America defensive lineman, who put it in
perspective for him at that team meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got up and just started talking,'' Jackson was saying with
a smile. ``He made it clear to all of us. He said, `We're here to
win the national championship.' And that was in the first meeting
of the season. My eyes kind of opened wide when I heard those
words. I just said, `Man, this is serious stuff.' And then I
thought about it. Around here, in any two of four years, you have a
real chance to win a national championship.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, as Nebraska has shown the past five years, you have a chance
to win a national title in any season.
</P>
<P>
   Ask Jackson why he came halfway across the country, far from his
family and friends, and he answers without hesitation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Program,'' he says. ``I came here because of The
Program.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
______ &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There aren't any written instructions or guidelines that tell
you when it will happen. Nor is there an official announcement or
press release.
</P>
<P>
   It just happens. Suddenly, it's not simply a school. Not merely
the University of Nebraska or Florida State University or Penn
State or the University of Michigan. It's The Program.
</P>
<P>
   As another college football season is about to begin _ this one
with a new bowl system that seems closer than ever to crowning a
national champion on the field rather than in the polls _ there
still is only a handful of elite programs that seem to be
legitimate contenders for the national championship.
</P>
<P>
   Which raises a simple question: What does it take to go from
being a football-playing school to a Program?
</P>
<P>
   Is it simply winning games? Or is it something else, something
intangible, a feeling you get when you walk into a stadium that
tells you this is more than a sport, more than a group of
student-athletes going out on a Saturday afternoon and playing for
school spirit? &QL; 
 &QL; 
Start by winning
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Winning seems to be almost a given as one of the necessary
elements. In the '90s, Nebraska, Florida State, and Florida are a
close 1-2-3 in winning percentage. Not surprisingly, those schools
have won or shared the last five national championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winning helps build tradition,'' says Big East commissioner
Mike Tranghese, who has a school in Miami that from the mid '80s to
the early '90s epitomized a Program. ``And if you have that, then
you have a constituency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at Penn State, Nebraska, and Michigan. Even when those
schools struggle, they continute to have sellouts, and that helps
programs to be legitimate. The common element is a huge attendance
base.''
</P>
<P>
   A move to the highest level seldom happens in a year or even
two. It takes a series of successful _ and highly publicized _
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Take Florida. Until Steve Spurrier arrived back at his alma
mater in 1990, Florida was just another school that played football
_ not all that well _ and cheated _ not all that well _ in a
conference dominated by Alabama, Auburn, and Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't happen right away,'' said Spurrier, whose work with
the Gators culminated with their first national championship in
1996. ``It took a while. But we had all the resources here. When I
got here in 1990, there was a black cloud hovering over the
program. Slowly, we got more and more good players to come here.
Now it's our challenge to win it all each year.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Nebraska, Florida is a threat to win it all any season. Not
only are the Gators in a high-profile league (the Southeastern
Conference), playing before sellout crowds of almost 90,000 each
Saturday, but they also are in arguably the richest recruiting area
in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Each year, Florida, and then Florida State, picks the best
talent in the state. Then everyone else gets their turn. The
advantage is so huge that even Notre Dame doesn't bother to recruit
heavily in Florida any more.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've pretty much conceded the best players in the state each
year to Florida and Florida State,'' said Notre Dame coach Bob
Davie.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Bowden has been at Florida State since 1976 and can cite
for you, chapter and verse, the times when an in-state recruit
wouldn't even consider the Seminoles.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first came here, I really didn't come with the idea of
staying,'' said Bowden, who has built the Seminoles into the most
consistent program in college football, with 11 straight final
rankings of No. 4 or better. ``I was going to stay maybe four or
five years and go back home to Auburn or Alabama.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowden built up Florida State football the way John Calipari
built up the University of Massachusetts basketball program: by
playing anyone, anywhere, at any time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't take any shortcuts,'' said Bowden. ``We tried to
build it right. We struggled some at the start, but now we got it
to where it's going pretty good.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think kids want to play in a highly visible program. They
want to play in a bowl game. They want to play at a place where
they have a chance to win the national championship. All that stuff
we have, plus we have location. Places like Florida and Southern
California are natural drawing powers.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first got here, we couldn't get a kid to take a visit.
Just couldn't do it. Now we can.''
</P>
<P>
   As Nebraska has proven, however, location is not the only
drawing card for athletes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Athletes look at us and they look at the wins,'' says Nebraska
coach Frank Solich, who has the tough task of following Tom Osborne
as the Huskers' new mentor. ``Its pretty obvious that's important
to players. I think they respect Nebraska for what we've
accomplished.''
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska has accomplished quite a bit, including 2 1/2 national
championships in the last four seasons, no losing seasons for the
last two decades, and an almost guaranteed spot in the Top 10 every
year.
</P>
<P>
   Solich, who is replacing a legend in Osborne, says he will use a
basic premise in coaching: If it ain't broke, don't fix it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be ridiculous to set aside those things that helped
this program get to where it was,'' said Solich, sitting in an
office that seemed strangely empty without the overwhelming
presence of Osborne. ``I'm not looking forward to doing a lot of
things differently.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the Nebraska lure is a tradition that turns the football
stadium in Lincoln into the third-largest gathering place in the
state, with more than 76,000 worshipers of Cornhusker football.
</P>
<P>
   ``History and tradition are part of the success of this place,''
said Nebraska athletic director Bill Byrne. ``Nebraska has that.
But there was a time in the '40s and '50s when the administration
here wanted to de-emphasize football and it showed. Then in 1962
they brought in Bob Devaney.''
</P>
<P>
   Devaney restored a commitment to Nebraska football that remains
today. He upgraded facilities, brought in better athletes,
recruited on a wider scale. He turned a football-playing school
into a Program. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Success can have a price
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If there are other key elements to building a Program besides
winning, facilities and coaching continuity seem to be prominent
among them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at us,'' said Bowden. ``I've been here 23 years. Most of
my assistants have been around 15, 16, 17 years. Look over at Penn
State, where Joe Paterno has had a staff that's been around
forever. Those things are important.''
</P>
<P>
   A downside of schools becoming Programs is that sometimes
shortcuts are taken or a recruiting class comes in more noteworthy
for what it does off the field than on it. That happened at Miami,
which is only now recovering from the excesses of the Jimmy Johnson
and Dennis Erickson eras.
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska, too, has had to deal with some unpleasantness in
recent years. Incidents involving Lawrence Phillips and Christian
Peter are still prominent in the consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   But Byrne says Nebraska has learned from the past and is going
into a new century with a more complete program. He ticks off a
dozen things the ``new'' Nebraska athletic program is doing _
things ranging from nutritional to psychological evaluation and
help.
</P>
<P>
   ``We stress wellness here,'' said Byrne. ``We have counseling
and seminars on everything from date rape and anger abuse to
problem-solving skills. We're dealing with a new set of issues. The
Ozzie and Harriet family background of the '50s and '60s just
doesn't exist anymore. Less than 40 percent of our athletes have
any kind of health insurance at all. We're getting kids who come
here from living with grandma, or from a single-parent household,
or no parents at all. We treat our athletes like family.''
</P>
<P>
   Coaches say they try to control what they can, but they can't
control everything and everyone. The NCAA doesn't allow them to,
and they don't really want to, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just the way it is,'' said Bowden. ``Now you find
things out on the evening news or in your newspaper. You just hold
your breath and hope you are doing things right. But you never
know, you never know what can happen.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the rewards seem worth the risk for a Program.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I was 30 years old,'' said Bowden with a smile and a shake
of his head, ``I might be able to tolerate losing some. But at 69,
I ain't got much time anyway. I like this side better than the
other side. I like the way it is now. I like our Program.''

EXPERTS SAY RUSSIAN WOES WON'T SWAMP UNITED STATES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WENDY TANAKA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ American investors shouldn't fret about the
Russian currency crisis.
</P>
<P>
   So say Michael Bernstam, a Hoover Institution fellow and
co-author of the recently published ``Fixing Russia's Banks: A
Proposal for Growth,'' and Hartmut Fischer, an economics professor
at the University of San Francisco. The Hoover Institution on War,
Revolution and Peace is a public policy research center at Stanford
University in Palo Alto, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   We asked the two to explain why the Russian economy is
collapsing and what impact it will have in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Question: Is Russia's economy really collapsing; if so why?
</P>
<P>
   BERNSTAM: Yes, but it had collapsed quite a while ago. It was
seven years in the making. That's when Russia started its economic
reforms and began privatizing its industries. Now, Russia is in a
very deep depression. Their depression is much greater than our
Great Depression. Our depression was 30 percent of our gross
domestic product; theirs is 44 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Before the reforms, Russian annual income _ per capita, in
world-market comparable prices _ was about $7,500. Now, it's
$4,000. It's poorer than Botswana, which has an average annual per
capita income of about $5,600. Mexico is about $8,000. The average
Mexican is twice as rich as the average Russian, and Mexico is a
very poor country.
</P>
<P>
   FISCHER: Privatization didn't work because it fell into the
hands of an oligarchy, which hasn't made major changes in Russia's
companies in terms of modernizing them. Russia still has lots of
companies producing old stuff that's not competitive in the world
market.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why is this happening now?
</P>
<P>
   BERNSTAM: It is happening now because Russia has accumulated so
much debt that it cannot pay. It's been borrowing heavily from the
West since 1995 for its privatization efforts. It's a policy
failure. They created an economy of looters and pirates.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has advised the Russian government to ignore
all their debt problems and the liabilities of their companies, and
go ahead with privatization. And secondly, to stop inflation, we
advised them to issue debt. Now that debt is the noose around their
necks that's strangling them. We did not understand what was going
on.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is Russia's crisis a result of the Asian crisis?
</P>
<P>
   BERNSTAM: It's coincidental. The Asian crisis contributed to it,
but the Russian crisis has had its own momentum. How the Asian
crisis impacted Russia was that it scared off foreign investors
from emerging markets. So people started to sell Russian stocks.
The Asian flu worsened Russia's general sickness.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why does what is happening in Russia affect the U.S. stock
market?
</P>
<P>
   FISCHER: It will lead people to reassess the presently high
stock valuations. Any crisis will have a negative effect on the
market. It adds to a certain amount of pessimism.
</P>
<P>
   Now, investors are even more afraid to put their money in other
emerging markets like Latin America and Asia. They're pulling money
out and investing in U.S. bonds, so bond prices have been going up.
It's a safe haven.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Will this affect my mutual fund or 401(k)? Why?
</P>
<P>
   BERNSTAM: Not directly and not much, unless your mutual fund was
exposed to Russia and unless it was badly exposed to some other
shaky countries.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. has trillions invested in mutual funds around the
world. Of that, Russian stocks and bonds accounted for a fraction.
So, it's not a big deal at all for the U.S. But if we lose more
elsewhere, and depending on how much, it may become a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street is feeling uneasy about it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Should small investors be worried?
</P>
<P>
   BERNSTAM: No, for the same reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Will this crisis affect anything in the U.S. beyond the value
of stocks, such as inflation or unemployment?
</P>
<P>
   BERNSTAM: No.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do we depend on Russia for any goods and services?
</P>
<P>
   FISCHER: Except for some gasoline, no. Russia is a substantial
exporter of oil, so it will probably try to sell more oil. But this
shouldn't lower prices since they've already been declining.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Which U.S. industries _ and companies _ are most heavily
involved in Russia? What will happen to them and how will it affect
consumers?
</P>
<P>
   FISCHER: There will be some impact, but the Russian market
usually isn't a big part of their business. Many of these companies
in Russia, like Coca-Cola and McDonald's, knew it would be
difficult, that there might be disasters. But they wanted to have a
presence in the market because they believed it had a great future.
Now, that future is postponed.
</P>
<P>
   I'm sure they're not going to pull out. They'll weather the
storm.

SEMINOLES HAVE STAYED IN TOP FORM

<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ Some coaches will flinch, not wanting to
hear the words or accept the pressure that comes with them. Other
coaches are almost blase about it, as if it isn't a big deal at
all.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is Bobby Bowden. Tell the veteran Florida State
coach that you think his team is No. 1 in the country and Bowden
will smile, laugh, look you in the eye, and say, ``So do we. So do
we.''
</P>
<P>
   So here we are at the start of another season, and the annual
question is posed: Who's No. 1?
</P>
<P>
   Why Florida State? Why not?
</P>
<P>
   Consider that, since 1987, Florida State:
</P>
<P>
   _has finished no worse than fourth in the final Associated Press
poll, an NCAA record;
</P>
<P>
   _has become the only program in NCAA history to win 10 or more
games for 11 straight years;
</P>
<P>
   _has a combined record of 118-15-1;
</P>
<P>
   _has been ranked No. 1 by the AP 41 times and been in the Top 10
160 of 170 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't hide our ambitions,'' said Bowden. ``Our goal is to
be No. 1 when the season is over.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowden has reached that goal only once _ in 1993. But were it
not for a couple of what Bowden calls ``wide right'' games _ in
which missed field goals cost the Seminoles victories against Miami
_ or a play or two against another arch rival, Florida, FSU might
have a handful of national titles.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're ranked No. 1, it brings a lot of notoriety to your
program,'' said Bowden. ``But it leaves you no room for error. And
every year, we've had one of them. You may have a chance for one,
but not two. If you go errorless, you've got a chance to win that
darn thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to this season, which will open for FSU Monday
in the Meadowlands against Texas A&AMP;M in the Kickoff Classic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got as good a chance as anybody,'' said Bowden, who has
14 starters back from last year's 11-1 team, which finished a
strong runner-up to Michigan and Nebraska in the polls and in the
opinion of many people may have been better than either of those
teams.
</P>
<P>
   This year's team has some holes, most notably at quarterback,
where 26-year-old sophomore Chris Weinke moves into a leadership
role with almost no college football experience, and along the
offensive line, where experience, not talent, is the only missing
ingredient.
</P>
<P>
   Defensively, FSU is as tough as ever, which means tougher than
almost every other team in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got the players,'' said Bowden. ``Now it's just a matter
of getting it done.''
</P>
<P>
   FSU probably will get it done, although a schedule that includes
Texas A&AMP;M, Southern Cal, Miami, Florida, and rising Atlantic Coast
Conference powers North Carolina and Virginia offers no guarantees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got all we can handle,'' acknowledged Bowden. ``We play
as tough a schedule as you'll find, and it seems like everybody
else is playing Georgia Southern.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that Bowden is complaining. He wants it this way. He wants
to play the best, because by doing so he feels he can be the best.
</P>
<P>
   Every year, FSU comes close. Only in 1993 did everything work
out the way Bowden planned.
</P>
<P>
   On the night of Jan. 4, 1999, in the Fiesta Bowl, Bowden and the
Seminoles should get championship No. 2.

A DO-IT-YOURSELF DYNASTY IN DIVISION 3 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALLIANCE, Ohio _ The day is hot and sticky, normal for Northeast
Ohio in August. Larry Kehres doesn't mind. Not a bit. Kehres is
already in fall mode, putting on his game face, so to speak, as he
prepares for another football season.
</P>
<P>
   Kehres has reason to be enthusiastic. He is the coach of
back-to-back national champions and has an astounding 94-6-1 record
in the '90s, which includes a 77-2-1 mark during the regular
season, three national titles in the past five years, and a winning
streak that has reached 28 games.
</P>
<P>
   So on a steamy Thursday afternoon, only a few days before the
start of practice, Kehres is hard at work _ putting together a new
blocking sled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, yeah,'' he says. ``Down here, we don't have equipment
managers or big-timers like that. So we have to do it ourselves.
Took us a while to figure it out. We had to do it three times. We
were laughing among ourselves, saying, `Are we that dumb?' We
should have videotaped how we did it so we can do it again.''
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to Division 3 football, where the game may be the same,
where the athletes are just as enthusiastic and intense on
Saturdays, where the desire to win is equal to what you will find
at such hallowed college football places as South Bend, Ind.,
Lincoln, Neb., and Tallahassee, Fla. _ but where the fringe
benefits are almost nonexistent.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why Kehres, with more national championships than
Florida State's Bobby Bowden and Florida's Steve Spurrier combined,
with a higher winning percentage than anyone in history except
Notre Dame's Knute Rockne, is putting together a blocking sled on a
hot summer day. And it is why he will be shoveling the snow off the
field in November and December when winter arrives at Mount Union
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
______ &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even at its busiest, when nearly 2,000 students are roaming the
campus, Mount Union has a cozy, comfortable feel to it. Alliance is
Middle America, a place where people don't necessarily latch their
doors at night, where the sound of lawnmowers and weed whackers is
more prevalent than traffic and police sirens.
</P>
<P>
   That is not to say it is without a pulse. Sitting in a corner of
Northeast Ohio, an hour southeast of Cleveland, an hour and a half
northwest of Pittsburgh, and just east of Akron, Mount Union is in
the heart of a territory rich in football tradition and deep in
talent. The arrival of fall gets the juices flowing here.
</P>
<P>
   Canton, Ohio, the home of the Pro Football Hall of Fame, and
Massillon, Ohio, a hotbed of high school talent, are only minutes
away. The nation's Division 1 powers come here to sweep away the
super blue-chip athletes. But what they leave is not bad, and in
Division 3, this gives Kehres a huge advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great state for high school football,'' says Kehres, an
Ohio native who is in his 28th season at Mount Union (he has been a
player, an assistant coach, and for 12 years the head coach). ``All
around Northeast Ohio, and into Western Pennsylvania, you'll find a
lot of talent and you'll find that most of the players are
fundamentally sound. When it comes to things like blocking and
tackling, we don't have to start on Page 1.''
</P>
<P>
   But with no athletic scholarships, an Ohio Athletic Conference
rule that prohibits home visits, and a no-cut policy that allows
every student who shows up to compete, the recruiting of talent can
be difficult.
</P>
<P>
   For much of its history, which dates back to 1893, Mount Union
football has been a middle-of-the-road program. That changed in
1986, when Kehres, a former quarterback who still holds the school
record for longest completion (95 yards), was elevated from
assistant to head coach. Since then, the Purple Raiders have not
had a losing season. Since 1990, they have not lost more than two
games in any season. And they have turned themselves into the
winningest college football program in the nation _ with a better
record than Florida State, Nebraska, and everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   Kehres, who has had opportunities to move to a higher level
(most recently at Kent State), brings a Division 1-A mentality to
his Division 3 program, especially as a season is about to begin.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's pretty intense,'' says senior running back Ryan Gorius, a
three-year letter-winner. ``I don't think he's any different than
coaches you would find at a lot of big schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly not in game preparation or desire to win. The Purple
Raiders still have to compete with freshman high school teams for
stadium time, and the media attention comes only during the
playoffs, but listen to Kehres or Gorius or linebacker Jason Hall,
the leading tackler on a team that led the country in scoring
defense last season, and what you hear does not reflect a casual
attitude toward football.
</P>
<P>
   ``This,'' said Kehres, sitting in an office filled with trophies
and cluttered with a shipment of new shoes, ``is my favorite time
of year. I like going to practice. Liked it as a player. Like it as
a coach. You get a sense of accomplishment. It still comes down to
a core ingredient of hard work.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
______ &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Purple Raiders have indeed worked hard the past few years,
their efforts last year producing a 14-0 season and second
consecutive national championship.
</P>
<P>
   And while the framework for success remains in a solid group of
returning seniors, there are enough question marks _ especially at
the skill positions _ to lead some people to think Mount Union
might lose a game this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest challenge we have is to get players and coaches to
be patient and be realistic in the rate of improvement we have,''
says Kehres. ``We had a quarterback here who started 53 consecutive
games. He started every game from the time he walked onto this
campus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell our players this won't be a continuation of the past
two years, but something we will have to build ourselves as they
get more experience.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mount Union experience of the past two years was remarkable,
a 28-0 run.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter what happens this year, we're going to have those
last two seasons,'' said Gorius. ``We're going to have it next
year, 10 years from now, and as long as we live.''
</P>
<P>
   But this group of seniors does not want to be the class that
breaks the string, whether that means losing a regular-season game
or not winning the national championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``We already got together as a group and talked about it,'' says
Hall. ``We're not living in the past. We know we've got a lot of
work ahead of us, but we have a lot of leadership and a good
nucleus of people coming back.''
</P>
<P>
   Kehres cautions that the expectations may be too high.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people are telling me that they'll come see us in a
playoff game,'' said Kehres. ``I tell them they're taking a chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be a hard year and we know it. We're not going to go
out and score 21 points in the first quarter every time we turn
around. Mentally, we're ready; I hope our fans are.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
______ &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Winning as much as this team wins can change people. Kehres says
that hasn't happened to him. At least he hopes it hasn't. Part of
the reason is the built-in humbling experience of coaching at the
Division 3 level.
</P>
<P>
   All coaches at this level are members of the college faculty and
required to teach 24 hours a year in credits. Coaching counts for
some of that, and as athletic director as well as football coach,
Kehres does no classroom work. But reminders that football is only
a sport here _ and not a multimillion-dollar business _ are never
far away.
</P>
<P>
   The changes Kehres has made are found in his approach to
players. As he nears 50, he says, he is more patient, more
tolerant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a much better listener than I was 7 or 8 years ago,'' he
says. ``I'm more adaptable at taking what the players say and
incorporating their ideas into what we do.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, he has also become more comfortable with his
status and how he teaches the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not Alabama, we're not Southern California,'' he says.
``We don't take other teams' offenses. We're our own.''
</P>
<P>
   The transition from good to great came in small steps.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like we had a master plan and it worked out
perfectly,'' Kehres says. ``It's more like we took some side steps,
maybe a step backward, before we finally got it right. All the time
we constantly asked ourselves what can go wrong. We spent a lot of
time being a problem solver.''
</P>
<P>
   Kehres sometimes has wandering thoughts on Saturdays, when
big-time college football floods the television screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just once it would be nice to run out on the field with
105,000 people cheering you,'' he says. ``But that's before the
game. Once the game starts and you put your headsets on, football
is football.''

 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ When the USA Today/ESPN preseason poll was released
this month, the usual programs were represented at the top. The
Ohio States. The Florida States. The Nebraskas. The Floridas. The
Michigans. All are past national champions.
</P>
<P>
   Further down the poll, there was UCLA, LSU, Tennessee, Penn
State, Georgia, Virginia, Auburn, and, at No. 24, Notre Dame. Among
the nouveau riche programs that cracked the rankings were Kansas
State (at No. 6), Colorado State (16), and Southern Mississippi
(21).
</P>
<P>
   As for Boston College?
</P>
<P>
   After going 4-7 last season and finishing in a fifth-place tie
in the Big East in Tom O'Brien's first year as head coach, the
Eagles were nowhere to be seen. BC was not even among ``others
receiving votes.''
</P>
<P>
   But there was a time not long ago when BC was indeed counted
among the Top 25 teams in the country. After a 4-7 season in 1991,
his first year at the helm, former coach Tom Coughlin restored the
foundering program to national prominence. In 1992, Coughlin
steered the Eagles to an 8-3 season and a Hall of Fame Bowl berth,
and in '93, they went 9-3, making a second consecutive New Year's
Day bowl appearance, in the Carquest.
</P>
<P>
   Each of those seasons was highlighted by a ``program-making''
game: in 1992, BC won at Penn State, 35-32, and the following year,
it upset top-ranked Notre Dame, 41-39, at South Bend, Ind.
</P>
<P>
   While BC managed to recapture some of the national limelight it
basked in after Doug Flutie's 1994 Miracle in Miami, the program
was still lacking in certain amenities _ namely, a refurbished
stadium and practice facilities _ enjoyed by other major programs.
</P>
<P>
   Until BC found a way to put more facilities on its cramped
campus, rival schools were certain to point out this drawback to
prospective recruits.
</P>
<P>
   Despite strong opposition from neighbors in Brookline, Newton,
and Allston-Brighton, BC finally upgraded its facilities in 1994,
expanding Alumni Stadium to 44,500 seats. But the man who lobbied
strongest for a new stadium, Coughlin, was not there to see it; he
left in February 1994 to become head coach of the Jacksonville
Jaguars.
</P>
<P>
   It was a stunning departure that shook BC's program to its
foundation. Coughlin's successor, Dan Henning, enjoyed a modicum of
success in his first season _ a 7-4 campaign punctuated by a 30-11
rout of Notre Dame and a trip to the Aloha Bowl _ but two years
later, BC was rocked by a gambling scandal that smeared the
school's reputation and eventually cost Henning his job.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it has fallen upon O'Brien, a 49-year-old former Marine and
Naval Academy graduate, to build things back up again.
</P>
<P>
   So where do you begin when you're building anew?
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at the top programs across the country,'' said
O'Brien, ``the No. 1 thing that strikes me is continuity _ not only
with the head coach, but with the assistant coaches and the people
who've been there for a long time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, winning has a lot to do with it. Maybe some guys
could have continuity in a program but haven't been afforded the
opportunity with patience within the administration and/or the
alumni to put all their ducks in place.
</P>
<P>
   ``A classic example is if you look at the University of North
Carolina. Mack Brown, I think he won one game in his first two
years, and he didn't have a winning season until his fourth year
and he was lucky to be 6-5. They showed great patience and
determination with him _ that he was going to do it. He kept his
staff mostly intact and made one or two coaching changes along the
way.''
</P>
<P>
   When O'Brien took his first head job in December 1996, after
serving as a longtime assistant to Virginia coach George Welsh, his
first order of business was to assemble a staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is a formula, but there are couple of different
things,'' O'Brien said. ``First thing is, when you take a job, you
have to understand the parameters of the job _ what is expected of
you and what they want out of the program. When you understand what
those qualifications are, then you go about as a coach making sure
you hire the right people that will fit into the system or the
program you want to build.
</P>
<P>
   ``With that said, the most important thing is _ and I always use
the phrase `in the boat' _ they have to be pulling their oars, and
they have to be rowing in the same direction, and they all have to
be on board, because it only takes one or two going in the opposite
direction to pull a program down.
</P>
<P>
   ``If everybody works towards the same goal _ not only on the
staff, but the support staff in the training room, the equipment
room, in the weight room _ and we're all on the same page, then
nobody cares who gets credit. The bottom line is to win football
games and to do it the right way. I think we have started with that
in place here at Boston College, so we can build a foundation.''
</P>
<P>
   BC athletic director Gene DeFilippo thinks it begins with a
commitment from the very top of the administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is essential that you have a president who is committed,
because then you've got a real chance to build a successful
program,'' said DeFilippo, who came to BC from Villanova last
September as the successor to Chet Gladchuk, now the University of
Houston AD. ``The next thing is that you need an athletic director
who understands what it takes to help the coaches build a program.
For example, an athletic director has to do his part in the way of
facilities, and we're totally committed to our facilities here.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the recent improvements is a fenced and lighted practice
area on Shea Field, which in the past doubled as a parking lot for
the more generous boosters of BC football. In addition, BC will
finally have an indoor practice facility this winter when a 55-foot
bubble is erected over the stadium field.
</P>
<P>
   Given BC's strong academic reputation and its attractive setting
in Boston, O'Brien knows that the upgrades will make his program
even more attractive to local and national recruits.
</P>
<P>
   ``All that relates to the long-term effects of the program, and
it has to do with recruiting, which is as important a part of this
program as anything,'' said O'Brien, whose class of 18 recruits
this year included eight local athletes, including former St.
John's Prep quarterback Brian St. Pierre, who will likely redshirt.
</P>
<P>
   ``The better players I have, the better coach I'll become,'' he
said. ``In order to get the good players, there's something you can
promise right now _ the chance to play early, those kind of things.
But when you get this program off the ground and running and now
you're recruiting with top programs in the country year in and year
out, then facilities will become very important.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's where I think the athletic director comes into play and
does a great job. We seem to be on the same page with the vision of
where we want to go with this program and facilities.''
</P>
<P>
   If the rebuilding of BC's football program is analogous to the
construction of a house (``If you build a strong foundation, you're
going to have a strong home,'' said O'Brien), where does the
project stand?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still fighting some personnel things as a football team
because of what we inherited. It would be important for us to have
a good year to help us sign a good class.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to be better in recruiting and we have to be better on
the football field. Every day we want to try and improve this
program in some way or another.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when you get good.''
</P>
<P>
   And get back into the Top 25.

JONES' ROLE CAST IN DOUBT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ When Ferric Collons got wind that a reporter
asked Mike Jones about being ``on the bubble'' Collons said, ``He's
not on the bubble. He's on the team.''
</P>
<P>
   That is the kind of respect Jones has earned from his teammates.
They are protective of him because he is so fiercely loyal to them.
</P>
<P>
   Just two seasons ago, Jones was one of the defensive captains, a
true leader and inspiration, as well as one of the players who
keeps the team loose with his kidding and practical jokes.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are some real issues involving the veteran, numbers
being the biggest one.
</P>
<P>
   When coach Pete Carroll talks about his defensive tackle
rotation, he mentions Chad Eaton, Mark Wheeler, Henry Thomas, and
Brandon Mitchell. When he speaks about his ends, he mentions
Collons, Chris Sullivan, Willie McGinest, and Greg Spires. That's
eight players.
</P>
<P>
   Jones plays both positions. Last year, he started seven games in
place of McGinest at the elephant spot and four games for the
injured Collons.
</P>
<P>
   Does that mean Jones is the ninth defensive lineman? If he is,
what do the Patriots do with fourth-round draft pick Leonta Rheams?
The Patriots are not apt to cut such a high pick. If Rheams is
waived and then put on the practice squad, Jones is in. Would they
keep Jones over Rheams? Or Mitchell, their second-round pick of a
year ago?
</P>
<P>
   There's always the possibility the Patriots could swing a deal
for a defensive lineman. They are one of the few teams with depth
at a position that's fairly thin around the league.
</P>
<P>
   Jones is clearly a bit uncomfortable about the subject, but he
doesn't duck it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You really can't tell what an organization is thinking,'' said
Jones. ``Look at Pittsburgh and Greg Lloyd. That man is the
backbone of that organization. He represented the organization like
no player in the last decade, so you just don't know in this
game.''
</P>
<P>
   After two injury-filled seasons, the Steelers released Lloyd
this summer to save money under the salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   Jones says he thinks about his spot on the team only when
reporters confront him with the question.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing I feel is when I get in a game I need to make
some plays,'' he said. ``Everything else will handle itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just need to concentrate on my game. There's no need to talk
about it. You can't control what they say one way or the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``You think about it, and you hear you guys come to me that I'm
on the bubble again. You try and forget about it but you keep
throwing it up in my face. I deal with it like I can. I put the
negativity away and go about doing the things I need to do to get
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll finally mentioned Jones a couple of days ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike has been in the mix all along,'' said Carroll. ``He plays
all of the spots for us. He has become a utility guy. Last week he
played the elephant position and tackle and did all the stuff. He's
also been competing for an inside spot on the nickel team.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones turned 29 this week, so he's not yet thinking about life
after football. Most defensive linemen are just hitting their prime
at his age. If he doesn't hit his stride for the Patriots, there
are a number of teams that would be interested in him.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a blessing,'' said Jones. ``I'm fortunate to be playing
a position where there's a need. It's just like cornerbacks;
there's a need for corners in the NFL. I'm blessed that it is that
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones has been hampered with a knee injury throughout training
camp, but he considers himself to be at full speed. He will get
plenty of opportunities in the Philadelphia game Saturday night.
Unlike other veterans who just try to get through exhibition games
unscathed, Jones knows he has to do better than that.
</P>
<P>
   The other issue weighing heavily on his situation is money.
Jones's salary is in the high six-figures. The Patriots have some
cap room left, but they would have much more if they could drop a
veteran.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's reality,'' said Jones. ``That's just the way it is. I
don't let stuff like that frustrate me because I have no control
over it. I won't let that linger in my mind.''
</P>

 &HT;    Home care injustices
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Believe it or not, the best thing that's happened to Ray and
Frances lately has been for him to be declared terminally ill.
</P>
<P>
   They are counting this among their blessings due to new,
ruthless Medicare rules.
</P>
<P>
   Recently they were notified that Medicare was going to yank
funds for the home care that was keeping him out of a nursing home.
</P>
<P>
   Now, because he's been declared terminally ill, he is getting
Medicare-funded services through a hospice. Do we call this good
luck?
</P>
<P>
   Ray and Frances (not their real names) live in a Central Florida
retirement community. She called me after reading a column I wrote
about the plight of a man dying of Lou Gehrig's disease who got
similar ``good news'' after having the home-care coverage revoked
that was paying for home-care aides to visit him. Now, because he
could be classified as terminally ill, he would still get extended
Medicare coverage through a hospice.
</P>
<P>
   That shouldn't be necessary. In either case, the Medicare
recipient is sick enough not to have anyone splitting hairs.
Terminal? Not terminal?
</P>
<P>
   In Florida, Ray was virtually paralyzed by a severe stroke 14
years ago. He's been beset by complications of diabetes. His most
serious condition is gastro paresis, a near-paralysis of his
intestinal tract. Bowels are a life-or-death matter for everyone,
but for him it's an ordeal that calls for home-care aides. They
often act invasively and manually to clear an intestinal blockage.
</P>
<P>
   But in the eyes of Medicare under new cost-cutting rules, Ray
was just in a holding pattern, not ``sick'' enough _ no fever, for
instance _ to need a physician or nurse.
</P>
<P>
   The rules were included in Medicare reforms in the 1997 Balanced
Budget Act. Aimed at waste and fraud, the rules effectively drew a
line and capped projected home-care costs nationwide based on 1994
figures.
</P>
<P>
   What Congress didn't realize when it made its cuts was that
fraud wasn't driving up the amount of home care for which Medicare
was paying. Choice was doing that. People were turning to home care
over nursing homes, saving the federal government money in the long
run. It's as common as sundown for the costs of nursing home care
to sap someone of resources, effectively spending him or herself
into poverty and onto Medicaid rolls.
</P>
<P>
   That's exactly what would have happened in the case of Ray and
Frances. He would have gone into a nursing home. She has some
savings for that, but ultimately, depending on how long he lived,
it would be at a sum cost increase to the taxpayer.
</P>
<P>
   What's happening right now across the country is that because of
Medicare cuts, home care, an industry based on economy and choice,
is being decimated, driving many into nursing homes.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas alone, more than 1,000 home-care agencies have shut
down this year, with thousands more teetering on the brink.
</P>
<P>
   This has gotten Congress' attention. Indications are that
emergency measures may be taken in September.
</P>
<P>
   When I started to write this column I was prepared to use Ray's
and Frances's real names. Later she asked me to refrain. Though
things had worked out all right with hospice stepping in, she still
was worried about losing benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody knows when somebody is going to die,'' she said,
pointing out that the ``terminally ill'' classification for hospice
care is based on a six-month life expectancy.
</P>
<P>
   A wife worries she'll be penalized because her husband didn't
die on time. Imagine.

TERRIBLE FUND WORTH DUMPING, EVEN AT A LOSS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, August 30, 1998)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. On March 15 of 1996 I invested $5,000 in Van Wagoner Emerging
Growth fund, and I maintained a dollar cost averaging program in
the fund until July of that year. My total investment came to
$9,100, and it is now worth $6,700. I don't know what to do at this
point. Should I get out with such a loss, or stay in? I am
desperate at this time; I don't want to lose any more of my money.
What do you advise?
</P>
<P>
   M.C., Dedham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I suggest you chalk this one up to experience. The record of
Van Wagoner Emerging Growth is simply awful. Founded at the end of
1995, it got off to a bold start, showing 30.30 percent gains in
the first quarter of 1996, and following that with a 14.89 percent
gain in the second. From there on, it's been mostly downhill.
Entering this week, the fund's record showed a loss of 31.5 percent
over the past year, and a year-to-date loss of 11.6 percent. This
compares to a peer-group average gain of 3.7 percent over the past
52 weeks, and a 3.2 percent gain year-to-date.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the fund's woes can be tied to a portfolio very heavily
concentrated in two sectors -- technology and utilities. But since
both the technology and utility sectors have done a great deal
better than this fund, in the end the blame must be tied simply to
lousy stock-picking. Morningstar Mutual Funds reports that the fund
is moving to a more diversified portfolio, raising the fund's
portfolio from 79 to 112 issues during the first quarter. But since
the losses have continued since that point, there seems to have
been no positive effect. Because of its relative youth, Morningstar
doesn't rate the fund, but it seems likely that when the ratings
come, it will start out in the cellar.
</P>
<P>
   So I suggest you join the herd: money has been flowing out of
this fund steadily since 1996, and I suggest you follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   One word about your abandoned dollar-cost-averaging plan: When I
discuss dollar cost averaging I like to describe it as a
'discipline.' I use this word because when there is a downturn,
investors must grit their teeth and contemplate the prospect that
they might be throwing good money after bad. As it turned out, in
your case it was all to the better to quit. But as a general rule,
it's a bad practice to abandon a dollar-cost-averaging plan once
the investment begins heading south. After all, the entire logic
behind the plan is that you bring your average cost per share down
by adding additional shares at lower prices during a downturn. If
you lose faith in a fund that's the target of a dollar-cost
averaging program, the thing to do it quit the fund, but not the
program; you simply move to a better fund and resume the
discipline. I write this not so much to admonish you, but to
encourage other readers who are engaged in these programs not to
lose heart during the current choppy markets -- remember, the key
word is discipline.
</P>
<P>
   If you're still willing to stick with the mid-cap growth
objective, I suggest you take a look at T. Rowe Price Mid-Cap
Growth fund, one of the strongest funds in the category.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I would like your thoughts on selling four Fidelity funds
that are in a taxable account and have been held six years -- in
favor of switching to an index fund. I have $14,500 in Fidelity
Blue Chip Growth, $57,000 in Fidelity Equity Income II, $14,300 in
Fidelity Growth and Income, and $14,300 in Fidelity Puritan.
</P>
<P>
   J.A., Lunenburg, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I think the IRS would be very happy to hear of your proposal.
What you're considering is selling four very solid funds in which
you have achieved handsome gains over the last four years -- thus
generating a sizable tax bill. And while your current portfolio
isn't particularly well diversified -- the stock portfolios of all
four funds you hold are dominated by large-cap stocks -- the
chances are that if you buy a single index fund you will end up
with pretty much the same thing. Even if you went with Vanguard's
Total Stock Market Index fund, which tracks the nation's 5,000
largest stocks, you would still have a holding dominated by the
large caps. The only way you could get a diversified index
portfolio would be to buy a number of different Vanguard Index
funds -- you might use Index 500, the Mid-Cap Index, the Small-Cap
Index, and Balanced Index to achieve a good measure of
diversification.
</P>
<P>
   But I don't think that added diversification would outweigh the
negative effect of the big tax bill you would doubtless pay if you
sold, so my instinct would be to stand pat. I have long been a fan
of index funds, but I am also aware that their current popularity
is largely a function of the fact that for the last few years most
of them have simply been in the right place at the right time --
heavily invested in large-cap stocks during one of the most
enduring bull markets for large-cap stocks. I think at some point
the worm will turn, and then the highly rated managers of the funds
you hold will be able to show their stuff, adjusting their
portfolios to changing markets, rather than simply riding the
formulas as index fund managers must do.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. What's the best investment course I can take to increase my
income? I am 74 years old and I have $11,200 a year coming in from
Social Security. The rest of my income comes from IRA investments,
which are very conservatively invested in Treasury Notes and CDs.
The total comes to $316,000, with yields ranging from a low of 5.27
percent on a CD to 6.75 percent on a Treasury Note.
</P>
<P>
   S.M., San Diego
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I tally a portfolio average yield of 5.53 percent, bringing
you a total annual income stream of $17,488. I think you could
reasonably bump the income stream up by a little more than $3,000
-- but as always seems to be the case, when you get a better deal
there will be a price to pay. In this case, the price is risk. With
the Treasury Notes and the CD , you have substantially no risk; the
federal government stands behind both investments.
</P>
<P>
   Once you get into investments with higher yields, you will face
a whole spectrum of risks -- risk that the market value of your
investments will fall, risk that the yields will decline, and even
in some cases, risk that the issuers of bonds you own will default.
</P>
<P>
   A conservative and well-managed bond fund can mitigate and
reduce some of these risk levels, but you can never escape it
entirely. So right from the outset you will have to decide whether
an additional $3,000 a year is worth the risk that your investment
might perform poorly. You should decide further whether you are the
kind of person who can watch an investment with an ever-changing
market value calmly; for some people, the worries that come with a
market investment completely outweigh the slightly higher yields.
</P>
<P>
   If you're still with me, I suggest a portfolio of no-load mutual
funds in the following categories -- a Ginnie Mae fund, invested in
federally-guaranteed mortgage securities, a short-term bond fund,
and a high-yield bond fund. If half the portfolio were in the GNMA
fund and the balance split between the short-term and high-yield
bond funds, you could expect an average portfolio yield of about
6.5 percent, bringing you an income stream of $20,540 a year. You
can also expect the value of your holdings to be in more or less
constant flux -- rising in value when interest rates fall or are
expected to fall, and falling in value when interest rates rise. In
addition, you could expect the high-yield bond fund to fall in
value if the economy goes into a tailspin. But if you look at such
a portfolio over the course of many years -- say a decade or more
-- what you'll likely see is little or no change in principal
value, and a steady stream of interest checks.
</P>
<P>
   So three warnings apply to such a portfolio. First, you must
understand and accept the risk factors that are inherent in bonds.
Second, you should invest only for the long term, committing only
money you expect to leave there for a decade or more.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, if there's a chance that you'll need money to face
an emergency, you'd be best off leaving a reasonable amount in a
more cautious investment such as a money market fund -- so you
won't have to face the prospect of selling bond fund shares at a
bad time in the event you need money on short notice.
</P>
<P>
   Most large fund families sell mutual funds in these categories.
My favorite is Vanguard, especially when it comes to bond funds,
because Vanguard adopts a straightforward plain vanilla approach to
managing such funds, and second because Vanguard's typically low
expense levels tend to give them an extra edge in performance.

 &HT;    High winds blamed for death, leave over 8,000 without power
 &HT;    By Ginger Livingston, Tom Langhorne, Emilio Sahurie and Angela
Forest
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELIZABETH CITY, N.C. _ For a hurricane that supposedly was down
for the count, Bonnie sure packed a heck of a nasty second punch.
</P>
<P>
   The hurricane-turned tropical storm-turned hurricane ravaged
communities across the Albemarle with high winds late Thursday
night, causing at least one death and leaving hundreds battling
floodwaters and thousands more without electricity.
</P>
<P>
   James ''Pee-Wee'' Edwards, Pasquotank-Camden Central
Communications director, said tornadic activity was reported
throughout both counties around 11:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had several people call who said they saw tornadoes but it
is still unconfirmed,'' said Christy Saunders, Pasquotank-Camden
Emergency Management director.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it wasn't tornadoes, it was probably straight-line winds.''
</P>
<P>
   Saunders said this morning that wind gusts of approximately 83
mph were reported in Elizabeth City. And the National Weather
Service has an unofficial report of 93-mph winds in Currituck
County.
</P>
<P>
   It was in the Currituck community of Barco that a 12-year-old
girl was killed when a tree fell on her home as she was sleeping.
Law enforcement authorities had not released the victim's name --
believed to be North Carolina's only fatality from Bonnie -- as of
presstime this morning.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the rest of the damage from Bonnie's fierce winds seemed
confined to cosmetic damage to houses, downed power lines and
fallen trees.
</P>
<P>
   In South Mills, Joyce Medlin said she was awakened early Friday
by the cries of neighbors after a large oak tree crushed their
garage. Medlin's car was parked in the garage for protection
against the storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bonnie didn't pass through this area like people were
saying,'' Medlin said. ``It stayed around a lot longer than
expected.''
</P>
<P>
   Barco resident Rosemary Gilbert said the storm shattered three
windows and ripped shingles at her home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been through a hurricane before but this one scared the
heck out of me,'' Gilbert said. ``It was just nasty.''
</P>
<P>
   The strong winds also flipped over a 17,000-pound
tractor-trailer on Kelsey Road in the Newland township of
Pasquotank County.
</P>
<P>
   Not all of the damage came during Bonnie's second pass through
the region, however. Around 4 p.m., a large pine tree,
three-to-four feet in diameter, snapped and blocked Body Road for
approximately four hours.
</P>
<P>
   When the tree fell it brought down several hundred yards of
electric lines. No homes or vehicles were damaged.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a crash and when I looked outside there was a lot of
electricity, a lot of fire,'' said Lorraine Payne, who lived
nearby. ``It tore down my transformer, dropped it in my driveway. I
was worried because wires were hanging on my car but luckily it
wasn't raining and (the electric crews) came right away.''
</P>
<P>
   The tree was removed and electric power restored around 9 p.m.,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Pasquotank-Camden emergency management officials could offer no
concrete estimates this morning for damages and flooding, though
that will surely change as the day progresses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've received no reports of flooding, and there's been no
major, major damage reported to us -- but I'm sure there will be
some later this morning as people wake up and get stirring and
looking around,'' Edwards said before 7 a.m. today.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards, emergency communications director for
Pasquotank-Camden-Elizabeth City, said most of the structural
damage to houses, and power outages, are believed to have occurred
between 11 p.m. Thursday and 2 a.m. today, when winds were
heaviest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We received several unconfirmed reports of tornadic winds for
that period,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many streets and yards in Elizabeth City's rivershore
communities were littered this morning with downed trees or parts
of trees. Roads on Rivershore Drive and Riverside Avenue, and
surrounding neighborhoods, were covered with tree branches of
various sizes and other debris from trees.
</P>
<P>
   Everything was soaked.
</P>
<P>
   At 1000 Riverside, a large portion of tree lay suspended across
a power line. On the 1100 block of Parkview Drive, a large tree lay
across the road, making it impassable by vehicles. At 1207 Fairfax
Avenue, a tree was split almost evenly down the middle, a portion
of it still standing and the other portion lying in the yard.
</P>
<P>
   Flooding in rivershore communities appeared this morning to have
receded since mid-Thursday afternoon's storms, when some
intersections were so congested with water that vehicles could not
pass. At one such intersection, Flora Street and Riverside Avenue,
water appeared to be several feet deep.
</P>
<P>
   Like it was in other areas, much of the damage in Currituck
seems to have occurred after 11 p.m. Much of it centered around
central and northern Currituck County, said Sheriff Glenn Brinkley.
</P>
<P>
   Brinkley said winds in Corolla and Grandy were only clocked at
around 20 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Strong winds also downed trees in Knotts Island preventing a
sheriff's deputy from driving through the main causeway.
</P>
<P>
   ``So much has happened last night,'' Brinkley said. ``People
don't realize the damage until they see it for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   More than 8,000 North Carolina Power customers in Pasquotank,
Perquimans and Currituck counties had lost power as of 7:15 a.m.
today.
</P>
<P>
   The figure represents the vast majority of the company's
approximately 10,160 customers in 19 northeastern North Carolina
counties who lost power as a result of Hurricane Bonnie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't have an estimate of when we hope to get
everyone restored,'' North Carolina Power spokesman Bryant Brooks
said shortly after 7:30 a.m. today. ``I can say that we are working
on it around-the-clock, with some help from contract crews and
(employees of) Virginia Power.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks said outages in Camden totaled only about 150.
</P>
<P>
   Some 5,000 of the City of Elizabeth City's power customers --
about half of the total -- were knocked out, City Manager Steven
Harrell said this morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost only about 1,000 customers during Hurricane Bertha,
and they were back up by the end of the day,'' Harrell said at
about 8:20 a.m. ``But anytime you've got half your customers out,
like we do now, that's a pretty severe outage.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrell said most of the power outages are concentrated in the
northern and western parts of town. The rest of the city suffered
only ``sporadic'' outages, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked when power might be restored, the city manager had no
estimate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Crews are working right now,'' he said. ``We have a mutual aid
contract with other members of ElectriCities, and crews from (some
of those municipalities) are on their way here now. I expect it
will take a couple of hours for them to get here and get working.''
</P>
<P>
   At the height of the storm, 9,000 customers were without power,
said Jim Stone, a supervisor with the North Carolina Power office
in Elizabeth City.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have six contract crews and three tree trimming crews plus
our normal crews but I don't think we'll get everyone until
probably mid-morning Saturday,'' Stone said.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night's storm activity shocked many North Carolina
Power workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I left at lunch yesterday I didn't think the trouble was
going to be that bad, but coming back in last night, the winds
starting picking up and it got very bad,'' said Skip Mason, a
lineman.
</P>
<P>
   Mason's crew was sent to Camden County to restore power in the
area of Anytown Road.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was snapped poles, cross arms broken, everywhere,'' he
said. ``Acouple of times we had to take our chainsaws out and cut
our way through so we could go down the road.''
</P>
<P>
   Beside dozens of downed trees, one utility pole blocked N.C.
Highway 343, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Stone said it wasn't easy restoring electricity Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's the wind and the rain you're fight and then you have
to go down right-of-way lugging things in and out. It's not just
working along side the road,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Stone's counterparts with the Albemarle Electric Membership
Cooperative faced similar problems.
</P>
<P>
   A large part of Perquimans County, including Hertford and
Winfall, lost power at 11:30 p.m. As of 6:45 this morning, both
Hertford and Winfall remained without power, said Perquimans
Sheriff Ralph Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   In Chowan County, there were no injuries or structural damage
reported during the storm's second day, said Emergency Management
Official Patty Madry.
</P>
<P>
   Like other areas, Chowan reported widespread power outages
Thursday. None were widespread, however, and as of Friday morning
power in those areas had been restored, Madry said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had some temporary flooding at Pembroke Circle, West Queen
Street, Wildcat Road, King Street, Water Street last night. But
that is all clear today,'' she said this morning.
</P>
<P>
   Officials also said that high winds and water surges forced the
closing of the S-Bridge across the Perquimans River on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The storm added at least two feet of water to the Perquimans
River, causing 3-foot surges along the waterway. The bridge was
reopened to traffic early
</P>
<P>
   today.
</P>
<P>
   Perquimans Sheriff Robinson said strong winds forced down power
lines on Snug Harbor Road near U.S. Highway 17 and Bagley Swamp
Road off State Highway 37 late Thursday. Sheriff and police
officials, along with the State Highway Patrol monitored the lines
and checked major roads throughout the county to ensure they
remained open to traffic, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Flooding in the area appeared to be minor, Robinson said this
morning, with most of it reported near Harvey Point Road and at the
intersection of State Highway 37 and U.S. Highway 17 Business
heading toward the S-Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't had a chance to assess how some of the (minor) roads
are doing,'' he said. ``We have a lot of trees down on Holiday
Island and in Winfall (the winds) hit hard and there are trees down
toward Bagley Swamp. We have a lot
</P>
<P>
   of debris down naturally, but I think we should be in pretty
good shape,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Because of debris-filled highways, N.C. Highway Patrol and
Currituck County Sheriff deputies were ordered to block roads
leading into Currituck County.
</P>
<P>
   Around 9 a.m. this morning, road blocks were lifted to the
relief of a multitude of cars lined up at the major county
intersections such as U.S. Highway 158 and N.C. Highway 34.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina Power crews were also out restoring power to
parts of Currituck County which were hard hit by resurgent winds
from Bonnie.
</P>
<P>
   N.C. Department of Transportation trucks also scoured the county
cutting large limbs and removing them from major roads.
</P>
<P>
   Pasquotank-Camden Emergency Management's Saunders said
assessment crews will be patrolling both Pasquotank and Camden
today to see exactly how much damage occurred.

 &HT;    12-year-old child is only victim of Hurricane Bonnie in North
Carolina
 &HT;    Eds: ''Today'' is Friday.

<P>
   BARCO, N.C. _ A 12-year-old girl, apparently the only North
Carolina victim of Hurricane Bonnie, died in her Barco home after a
tree crashed through her bedroom shortly after midnight Thursday
night.
</P>
<P>
   The large tree was toppled by heavy winds that reached up to 90
mph, said Currituck County Sheriff Glenn Brinkley.
</P>
<P>
   The incident occurred around midnight while the victim and her
family slept in their two-story home near Central Elementary
School. Brinkley said until all family members are notified of the
death, the name of the young girl will not be released.
</P>
<P>
   Because of power outages and road blocks due to fallen trees and
debris, members of the victim's family were forced to walk to the
Sheriff's Office in Currituck, several miles from the site of the
incident.
</P>
<P>
   After comforting the mother of the victim and a couple of her
children who were in shock, deputies and emergency crews responded
to the home of the victim. Working under generator-powered lights,
emergency personnel spent about an hour removing the large tree and
clearing debris to reach the body of the girl.
</P>
<P>
   The victim is one of two persons who have died as a result of
Hurricane Bonnie. A Myrtle Beach, S.C., man was electrocuted by a
generator he was working on when the storm passed the South
Carolina coast.

 &HT;    Some Outer Banks residents toughed it out
 &HT;    Eds: ''Today'' is Friday.
 &HT;    By Emilio Sahurie
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELIZABETH CITY, N.C. _ For Outer Banks residents who stayed
behind when everyone else fled, Hurricane Bonnie had packed more
hype than punch by the time it crawled through the area Thursday
evening.
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, was before Bonnie regained hurricane strength
early this morning just east of the Outer Banks. The rejuvenated
storm pounded the area with heavy winds, rain and flood waters
before moving farther out to sea.
</P>
<P>
   While thousands of vacationers and residents were ordered to
evacuate the resort area on Tuesday, some across the Outer Banks
preferred to brace themselves for the worst in the comfort of
familiar surroundings - their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday afternoon, as Bonnie's wrath weakened crossing the
Albemarle region, Charlotte Draper's only concern was lifting
furniture and belongings off the floor. Although Bonnie's strength
was downgraded as it moved northeast toward the coast, rising water
levels associated with the system were a priority to many in the
barrier islands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime you raise the level of water, you know what happens,''
said Draper, who along with her husband, Bill, decided to stay at
home.
</P>
<P>
   Draper, who lives near the Currituck Sound in Kitty Hawk, said
an elderly mother and her husband's work with the Coast Guard
auxiliary were the main reasons why her family stayed behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people heeded the warning,'' Draper said. ``But a lot of
the people who stayed behind have gone through this kind of weather
before.''
</P>
<P>
   A day after Bonnie landed in the Wilmington area, the Outer
Banks looked more like a ghost town than a thriving resort
community.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been very quiet,'' realtor Doug Brindley from his Corolla
office said Thursday. ``Even more so than winter.''
</P>
<P>
   The local Post Office in Corolla closed on Tuesday after
evacuations orders were issued. But there were signs of life on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Wink's of Corolla, a local grocery store, remained opened this
week to the delight of those who stayed behind. Across the county
line, in Dare, storm stragglers made several convenient stores the
hot spot for fresh cups of coffee and other vital supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Brindley said he stayed because the overnight forecast from
Wednesday night did not predict any major impact on Currituck's
Outer Banks. As a volunteer fire fighter and the developer of 459
resort homes, Brindley also felt an obligation to help those who
lingered in the Outer Banks.
</P>
<P>
   Similar civic reasons made Mary Bichner keep the grocery store
she runs, one of the oldest businesses in Corolla open this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have lived here 27 years and I care about the needs of the
community,'' said Bichner, who has worked at Wink's for 16 years.
``I felt people should be able to come here for whatever they
needed.''
</P>
<P>
   From talking to Currituck County Sheriff's Deputies, Bichner
said she estimates about 600-700 people remained in the paved areas
of Corolla - not counting the Carova Beach area. That's a far cry
from the population explosion of more than 20,000 visitors that
pack into Currituck's Outer Banks on a weekly basis during the
tourist season.
</P>
<P>
   About the only major inconvenience in Corolla on Thursday was
the lack of water in one subdivision, Corolla Light. A local
utility company shut off the water supply from a water tower to
stabilize the structure from heavy winds. Lighter water towers are
considered more of a risk for toppling over.
</P>
<P>
   However, since the order to evacuate had not been rescinded by
Thursday afternoon, the water shortage in this particular community
wasn't a problem, said Brindley.
</P>
<P>
   The only preoccupation, Brindley and other real estate agents in
the Outer Banks had on Thursday was answering questions from
tourists eager to return. Because new tourists typically arrive on
a weekly basis, the earliest a new batch of tourists is likely to
return is this Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be nice to get them back,'' Bichner said. ``It will be
nice for business too.''

AN UPGRADE TO COACH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Walter Zenga salvaged the Revolution's 1997 season with a
spectacular comeback from knee surgery as the team qualified for
the Major League Soccer playoffs. Now, he can provide only a
spiritual and strategic role as the Revolution face a must-win
situation against Miami in Fort Lauderdale Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The saviors of the team are the players,'' said Zenga,
Thursdaywho was named to replace Thomas Rongen as coach three days
ago. ``They have to believe in themselves. They can't believe it's
over, because in soccer the game is not over until the final
whistle.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have to have what it takes within themselves, they have
to have respect for themselves, pride, and the will to do something
positive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like last year, maybe, I can pass on to the other players what
I know of the game. The difference is I will have to do it while
sitting on the bench instead of standing in the goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Zenga returned from Italy Thursday, and his initial greetings
were from Logan Airport workers while he awaited Revolution general
manager Brian O'Donovan and assistant coach Sid Mazzola.
</P>
<P>
   ``This feels like a second home,'' Zenga said. ``It's destiny. I
played my last game for Italy here, and we won, 2-0 (against the
Republic of Ireland June 4, 1992). Last year I played so well, and
it was a little bit crazy. But I really like living here.''
</P>
<P>
   The negotiated resignation of Rongen and the hiring of Zenga
occurred quickly after the Revolution fell, 5-1, to Los Angeles
last Saturday. Even Zenga at his most impulsive could not have
anticipated the speed of the change.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've done some strange things,'' said Zenga, ``and, yes, this
seems strange because six months ago I was told I couldn't come
back. And now, it's yes I can come back. But this is life. I can't
explain it.''
</P>
<P>
   Zenga said he considered renouncing his December retirement, but
by then, the Revolution had signed goalkeeper Ian Feuer. The
Revolution seemed to be moving in the right direction as they
earned 10 points in the first seven games of this season. After 26
matches, though, they have only 20 points and are in last place in
the Eastern Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Zenga, 38, inspired the Revolution last year even when he was
limited by injuries, bringing the experience of nearly 20 years of
playing in European. The Revolution have greatly missed the
intangible qualities Zenga added. He compared MLS teams to the US
national team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at the US in the World Cup,'' he said. ``They didn't play
badly. They were just missing a pizzico di furbizia (i.e. a little
cleverness, or smarts).
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of it is the mentality, part of it is because of the
rules. For example, this is the only place in the world where ties
do not exist, so it's not in the mentality. In Europe, when we are
playing badly, we know how to play not to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Zenga has continued to view the MLS from afar.
</P>
<P>
   ``D.C. United, as usual, is the best team, and Los Angeles is
playing very well,'' Zenga said. ``It looks like they could be the
best two teams, but Columbus is also playing very well and Kansas
City has the same players and is always difficult to play against.
Chicago is a new team that is playing well. Miami, I will see them
between now and Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   Zenga will meet the team for the first time this morning at
Babson College.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't talk about what the team needs,'' Zenga said. ``We
hope to do what we did last year, which was a miracle, winning in
the last minute of the last game.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Rongen's parting comments, he accused unnamed players of
sabotaging him, with speculation centering on the Revolution's
foreign players. ``I have nothing to say about Thomas because he is
no longer coach and it would be irrelevant to comment,'' midfielder
David Nakhid said. ``But if he does try to criticize me or hinder
my career in any way, I will take action. Otherwise, I have nothing
to say.''

PUTTING ON THE DOG NOW IS ARNOLD'S JOB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hush Puppies have been worn by Tom Hanks and Susan Sarandon.
They've been photographed by Richard Avedon. And now the perfect
footwear complement to horned-rim glasses and polyester pants will
be promoted by Arnold Communications of Boston, New England's
largest ad agency.
</P>
<P>
   Hush Puppies, a division of Michigan-based Wolverine World Wide
Inc., said Thursday it picked Arnold to be its new ad agency partly
because of Arnold's work in helping to launch the updated version
of the Volkswagen Beetle.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Beetle, Hush Puppies is a brand with ``a tremendous
past,'' but one that needs to ``freshen up the franchise,'' said
Jeff Lewis, Hush Puppies vice president of marketing.
</P>
<P>
   It will be up to Arnold, a subsidiary of Maryland-based Snyder
Communications Inc., to create ``breakthrough'' global
repositioning for a brand whose mascot is a famous basset hound.
</P>
<P>
   When new Hush Puppies ads from Arnold start breaking early next
year, will they use the dog?
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely,'' said Francis J. Kelly III, Arnold's chief
marketing officer and a managing partner.
</P>
<P>
   Doing for Hush Puppies what Arnold has done for the VW Beetle
could be a challenge. VW spends more than $100 million a year on
marketing in the United States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Hush Puppies, in contrast, has a global advertising budget
estimated between $5 million and $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   In choosing Arnold after an informal ad agency review, Hush
Puppies ended its six-year relationship with its previous ad
agency, Bozell Worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Asked the reason for switching agencies, Lewis said: ``It's a
difficult climate for the entire shoe industry.''
</P>
<P>
   To thrive in that climate Hush Puppies needs ads that are as
distinctive as Arnold's work for VW, and Bozell was not delivering,
Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   In creating a Hush Puppies campaign, the trick will be to come
up with ads that are ``respectful of the past, but also plug the
brand into how people live today,'' Kelly said.
</P>
<P>
   With its limited budget, the Hush Puppies account will only
partly compensate Arnold for the $40 million Century 21 ad account
the agency lost last week.
</P>
<P>
   But if Hush Puppies won't bulk up Arnold's bottom line, it will
give the agency a brand name with global recognition nearly as
great as the Nike swoosh or McDonald's golden arches.
</P>
<P>
   Hush Puppies has indeed enjoyed a storied career. When it
arrived on the scene in 1958, many men owned only two types of
shoes _ sneakers and wing-tips. Hush Puppies filled the gap in
between and, at one point, the brand boasted: ``We invented
casual.''
</P>
<P>
   Most people remember Hush Puppies as a single shoe model made of
pigskin suede. In truth, the Hush Puppies family includes several
lines and styles of shoes for men, women, and children.
</P>
<P>
   Some early models were named after employees' dogs. As a result,
a footwear aficionado could choose among the Duchess, the Bowzer,
or the Bozo as he or she decided which Hush Puppies style best
complemented the outfit du jour.
</P>
<P>
   But if the Hush Puppies Bozo was the preferred loafer of the
1950s hepcat and the '60s swinger, the fashion cachet of a once
proud shoe slowly began to erode.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1980s, Hush Puppies were viewed as more lame than tony.
In an unsuccessful attempt to convince sophisticates that they
should pad about pieds-a-terre and salons in pigskin suede, ads
from the era had the brand's canine mascot lapping Perrier from its
water dish.
</P>
<P>
   In the early '90s, Hush Puppies appeared to hit bottom.
</P>
<P>
   That's when ``a little company called Nike came in and rewrote
the rules for the shoe industry,'' Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid 1990s, however, Hush Puppies enjoyed a sensational
comeback. Actor Hanks wore a pair for much of his acclaimed
performance in the movie ``Forrest Gump.''
</P>
<P>
   Then a New York couturier dyed Hush Puppies in Day-Glo colors to
accent his latest collection of designer duds, and suddenly purple
Hush Puppies were hotter than Hootie &AMP; the Blowfish.
</P>
<P>
   Wolverine, which had 1997 revenues of $665 million, does not
disclose sales for its Hush Puppies brand, but Lewis claims they
have taken a quantum leap from the early '90s.
</P>
<P>
   Now, said Kelly, it's up to Arnold to help sustain that growth
and create a ``brand buzz'' around Hush Puppies that's comparable
to the one made by VW's Beetle.

BANKBOSTON HURT BY LATIN AMERICA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE BAILEY AND STEVEN SYRE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Put away the party hats.
</P>
<P>
   Just six months ago, BankBoston Corp. managers hosted a
reception to celebrate the company's stock crossing the $100 per
share plateau. The shares' value rose another 18 percent to a
dizzying peak by July.
</P>
<P>
   BankBoston's extensive Latin America business, where the bank
earns about 20 percent of its profits, was a powerful engine behind
the stock advance. Today, it is dead weight in a stock market
fearful of the world's emerging economies.
</P>
<P>
   BankBoston shares have sunk 32 percent since July 8, squeezing
nearly $6 billion in market value out of the stock. The shares,
down as much as 4 3/4 at one point Thursday, finished off 2 3/8 to
39 for the day (the stock prices reflect a 2-for-1 split executed
in June).
</P>
<P>
   There is no evidence BankBoston's Latin America operation is
struggling at the moment and president Henrique Meirelles insists
business is as profitable as ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clearly a matter of perception,'' said Meirelles. ``We
are still seeing very strong business.''
</P>
<P>
   In an analyst conference call last week, chief executive Chad
Gifford said he expected 1998 profits in Argentina to increase 15
to 20 percent and even more in Brazil, the bank's other key Latin
country.
</P>
<P>
   Several stock analysts and some investors, though cautious,
agree the BankBoston selloff has been overdone.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a real divergence between reality and perception,''
said analsyt Nancy Bush of Ryan, Beck &AMP; Co. ``Some of the
divergence is deserved, some is not.''
</P>
<P>
   BankBoston had pitched its Latin business to investors as a
growth story few banks could match, a way to boost earnings faster
than those of competitors that had to rely on the relatively
slow-but-steady US economy. In a word, it was BankBoston's edge.
</P>
<P>
   Meirelles, who had run BankBoston's operation in Brazil, was
promoted to chief execuitve and made the point man on an expansion
plan that poured millions in the Latin operation.
</P>
<P>
   A team of retail banking experts from cross-town acquisition
BayBanks, were dispatched to South America to build out the retail
franchise and its rapidly growing number of branches.
</P>
<P>
   The story was a hit on Wall Street. It made BankBoston special
and the market valued its stock at a premium to those of other big
banks.
</P>
<P>
   That's all history. The value of most bank stocks have declined
during the same summer period, but BankBoston's steeper fall has
transformed those shares from a premium investment to modestly
discounted goods.
</P>
<P>
   BankBoston insists it is well protected from tumultuous Latin
markets because most of the business is transacted in local
currencies and protected from dollar-based devalutations.
</P>
<P>
   Trading liabilities in South America's most precarious country,
Venezuala, are only about $10 million, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not a large trader,'' said Meirelles. ``What we are
expanding is our indigenous operations.''
</P>
<P>
   BankBoston boasts that it has survived, and usually thrived, in
past periods of Latin turmoil because of its quality reputation and
by taking advantage of wider interest rate spreads.
</P>
<P>
   But recent expansion is changing BankBoston's Latin business.
Just five years ago, 56 percent of operating income out of Brazil
and Argentina came from wholesale banking. Twelve percent came from
retail business and the rest was derived from treasury activities.
By last year, retail had expanded to 35 percent of operating income
and is expected to growth further.
</P>
<P>
   American banks with large retail operations suffer when the US
economy goes into recession and presumably it would hurt BankBoston
if the economies of important Latin countries dive.
</P>
<P>
   Meirelles said BankBoston would be cushioned because its retail
customers are people who represent the very high end of economies
in Brazil and Argentina. But rich people get hurt in a bad economy
too.
</P>
<P>
   This much is certain: BankBoston's stock will be tied more
closely than ever to the market's perception of Latin markets. For
better or worse.

CLINTON AND BLAIR PROFIT FROM EACH OTHER'S COMPANY 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BERNARD D. KAPLAN  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspaper   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ After President Clinton ordered cruise missile strikes
against alleged terrorist installations in Sudan and Afghanistan,
Britain's Prime Minister Tony Blair, as usual, was the first
foreign leader to back him.
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister has forged such a close relationship with
Clinton in the 16 months since he won office that any hesitation on
his part in supporting the attacks might have led other European
chiefs to hold back too, with serious diplomatic repercussions.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Blair are firmly established as the No. 1 chums of
global politics. They are to the late 1990s what former President
Ronald Reagan and former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
were to the 1980s: political partners who have given a special
personal ingredient to the so-called Anglo-American special
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   The comparison stops there, of course. Thatcher and Reagan were
conviction politicians who genuinely shared a set of economic and
social principles they sought to translate into reality. If their
current successors in the White House and No. 10 Downing Street
have any real convictions, they've managed to keep them well out of
sight.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in an effort to give their partnership greater intellectual
substance, they are promoting what they call a ``third way'' as an
alternative to traditional leftist and conservative policies. Next
month in New York, they are holding a one-day conference with such
leaders as Italy's left-of-center prime minister, Romano Prodi. to
discuss the concept.
</P>
<P>
   Yet fundamentally, what Blair and Clinton have in common is an
opportunistic approach to politics and a single-minded
determination to keep the voters content, even if that means
switching their positions every couple of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But aside from that, each keenly appreciates what he has to gain
from close association with the other.
</P>
<P>
   Blair's private life is as blameless as Clinton's is marred. So
from the president's viewpoint, it's good to have a personally
upright character like the British leader in his corner, standing
by his side at news conferences and praising his statesmanship in
glowing terms.
</P>
<P>
   If someone like Blair, after all, can so readily set Clinton's
sexual adventures to one side, how important can they be? Blair's
presence is a kind of character reference _ or so Clinton would
like the public to believe.
</P>
<P>
   However, the profit from the friendship isn't all on one side.
Blair's revamped Labor Party _ known as New Labor _ has tied its
banner to the notion that it is a transatlantic version of
Clinton's Democrats, with as much appeal to the middle class as to
its longtime labor union supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Blair's close identification with Clinton, a leader who has won
two national elections, has helped to silence critics within his
own party. They hope that through the association with the man in
the White House, Blair also has discovered the formula for a string
of election triumphs.
</P>
<P>
   As long as each draws benefit from it, the Clinton-Blair idyll
will go on.

NASHVILLE CABLE OUTLET FINDS NEW ENGLAND AUDIENCE AT NHIS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD MANLY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As president of The Nashville Network, the cable service known
mostly for auto racing and country music, David Hall has seen
viewership grow from 7 million homes in 1983 to 75 million last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Based on those Neilson numbers, TNN was higher-rated than CNBC,
E! Entertainment Television, ESPN2, and MTV, except on weekends.
</P>
<P>
   Hall received anecdotal proof of that recently when TNN sent a
truck filled with T-shirts, baseball caps, and other paraphernalia
emblazoned with the TNN logo to New Hampshire International
Speedway in Loudon.
</P>
<P>
   As Hall tells the story, the merchandise trailor sold out of
goods in one afternoon. TNN sent another load, and that sold out
the next day. ``The guy called us and said that people were really
hungry for the TNN stuff, so we sent another load,'' Hall said.
``After he sold all of that stuff, he closed up the trailor and
drove off.''
</P>
<P>
   TNN has become a household name, largely because of its auto
racing broadcasts. The network will carry about 90 live events this
year, including tomorrow's NASCAR CMT Twin 100's from NHIS and
Sunday's Farm Aid on CMT 300 Winston Cup race, also from the Loudon
track. Both start at 1 p.m. Veteran Eli Gold will call the action,
with Buddy Baker and Dick Berggren.
</P>
<P>
   Hall knows that auto racing has become ``must-carry
programming'' for TNN, which last year was acquired by CBS. ``Those
races produce our highest ratings and ad sales,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason for TNN's steady growth is that Hall saw his
niche and captured it. In a day when cable and over-the-air
networks are willing to spend billions of dollars on sports
properties such as professional football games, TNN focuses on auto
racing, fishing, and family entertianment. ``We are very proud
about that,'' Hall said. ``We don't put on programs with a lot of
violence or bad language.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall understands TNN's place in the television universe. ``When
the US invaded Iraq several years ago, some of out producers wanted
to know what we should have on for our viewers,'' he said. ``I told
them to tell our viewers to turn to CNN.''
</P>
<P>
   That attitude has helped TNN grow by about 15 percent each year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly think we have to be cautious,'' Hall said. ``There
is only a certain amount of sports advertising dollars out there.
We can't slice and dice too much of that pie.''
</P>
<P>
   As it is now, however, motor sports is making money.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Clemens comeback?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Believe it or not, Roger Clemens told ESPN's Chris Meyers on
Wednesday that he would not rule out playing in Boston again.
Clemens didn't provide any details during his ``Up Close''
appearance, and Meyers didn't ask ... Ivan Robinson's 10-round
slugfest with Arturo Gotti last Saturday night earned HBO an 8.1
rating, the highest ``After Dark'' has earned this year. The rating
means Robinson's split-decision victory was seen in about 1.8
million homes ... Fox Sports this week unveiled a nightly update on
the home-run chase. ``Countdown to 62'' consists of 15-second
updates airing every night between 9:30 and 10, detailing the
latest developments in Mark McGwire's and Sammy Sosa's attempts to
break the Roger Maris's season record of 61 home runs. Each update
comes during a commercial break and provides video highlights ...
ESPN2 signed a deal to televise three Harlem Globetrotters games.

NISSAN FRONTIER A YEAR OLD AND ALREADY CHANGED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)  
 (For release Sunday, August 30, 1998)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN R.WHITE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Frontier, introduced as a 1998 model, is a simple truck from
Nissan _ actually a line of simple little pickups, starting with
the standard cab equipped with basic 5-speed manual transmission,
rear-drive, and a four-cylinder engine with a sticker price under
$12,000. With the $470 delivery charge, it works out to $12,460 to
put a bottom-feeder Nissan Frontier in your driveway _ and there
isn't much dicker in that sticker. The dealer markup reflected in
that price is hardly enough to make it worthwhile taking it off the
delivery truck and mounting the hubcaps.
</P>
<P>
   The line spirals upward from there, ascending a series of steps
reflecting increased equipment, power, size, price _ and dealer
profit potential; you can have 4WD, king cab, automatic
transmission, V-6 engine, lots of bells and whistles, yet the top
sticker is still under $21K. This now; stand by for changes.
</P>
<P>
   With the '99 model year, that Standard model disappears in favor
of a new base XE grade, presumably priced somewhat more than the
old Standard but less than the '98 XE $13,190 bottom model.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, I met and liked the 1998 4-cylinder version
of Frontier; lately I have had more time in a top-of-the-line SE
4WD King Cab _ a '99 with the 170-horsepower V-6, four-speed
automatic gearbox, air conditioning, and all the ... well, this SE
didn't have all the bells and whistles. In '98, the SE came with
power mirrors, power locks, and power windows; the '99 SE came with
armstrong power _ manual window cranks and manual locks. The
mirrors appeared to be the power option, but, if so, somebody had
neglected to install the power control. One had to resort to
``digital'' control _ pushing with the fingers.
</P>
<P>
   The '99 sample is a prototype, not a production model.
Prototypes come through with the latest in what's new, but
sometimes the carryover stuff, the equipment that remains
unchanged, suffers in the rush to build the prototype _ whatever's
handy gets installed. That was my theory, anyway, but the fact is
that the SE for '99 comes standard with all that manual stuff.
Power windows, locks, mirrors and remote entry are offered as an
optional ``Power Package'' in '99.
</P>
<P>
   The prototype, by the way, isn't certified, can't be registered,
and so can't be sold; this nifty little truck will likely end its
brief career in a crusher, although some prototype vehicles wind up
in schools as teaching aids.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of offering this prototype for evaluation was to
give the writer a sense of the powertrain, that new V-6 engine in
particular. My sense is that this sparsely trimmed little truck,
after driving a long string of luxury-oriented vehicles and a
couple of heavy hauler trucks, was akin to a refreshing glass of
seltzer after too much rich food _ oh what a relief it was.
</P>
<P>
   Incipient arthritis does make a manual window crank a bit more
than a nuisance, and I recommend remote locking devices for
safety's sake, but the whole of the truck just set right, felt
good. The engine is powerful in this modest-sized vehicle, offers
good acceleration, decent torque to start a load moving, and
certainly wasn't overwhelmed by the juice drive.
</P>
<P>
   The handling was good for a light truck, improves somewhat with
a load. The light rear of an empty pickup naturally wants to come
around to meet the grille in very hard braking, and a high center
of gravity sets the Frontier to leaning on sharp turns. But the
Frontier behaved rather well; the rear end never did swing out, and
although the feeling of security became a little tentative as
centrifugal force tried to push it over in the hard corners, no
wheels lifted from the pavement, and the track was true to the
steering desired.
</P>
<P>
   Air conditioning is standard on the SE, and the air conditioner
in this baby, prototype or not, was Chill City, a most welcome bit
of comfort on a hot, sticky day. The glove box is minuscule. Two
key-shaped cupholders lie between the armrest _ which conceals a
square, covered bin _ and the shifter; the holders have removable
rubber inserts. Another pair sits behind the bin for the rear
passengers _ as if they will have room to drink.
</P>
<P>
   The King Cab, in this writer's opinion, is overstating the case
for room. If this be royal room, it might rank as earl or baron,
but king it is not. Jump seats fold out from the sides of the
truck; you sit with your knees facing the other passenger, and
you'd best be small passengers on a short trip. But, with the seats
folded up out of the way, there is room to put a lot of stuff
behind the front seats _ the seats slide forward to provide fairly
easy access to that rear room. Bring the tuba, the tools, the gun
rack, and fishing tackle _ I'd estimate six cases of wine fit back
there, or a couple of trunks.
</P>
<P>
   The cargo box was fitted with the optional $299 bedliner, and
tiedown loops were easily accessible through cutouts _ they are in
the corners near the top of the box. Towing capacity with the V-6,
by the way, is 5,000 pounds _ nice truck for hauling a small boat.
Fuel mileage worked out to a hair better than 19 miles per gallon
over about 560 miles measured.
</P>
<P>
   There are lots of pickup trucks out there in a variety of sizes.
I can't tell you this is the best of the lot _ it isn't _ but I can
tell you that it's a very good light truck, and this particular
rendition hit me right. I really, really liked it.

GORDON, EVERNHAM MAKE FOR FAST FRIENDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ever since they met, some seven years ago at a Busch Grand
National test session at Charlotte Motor Speedway, it seems theirs
has been a beautiful friendship. Or rather, a fast friendship, with
emphasis on the ``fast.'' Jeff Gordon, the 27-year-old NASCAR
Winston Cup driver of the No. 24 Dupont-sponsored Chevrolet Monte
Carlo, and crew chief Ray Evernham, the point man for Rick
Hendrick's three-car stable, would not want it any other way.
</P>
<P>
   The reason this Dynamic Duo has come to be regarded as the most
successful collaboration of the '90s on the Winston Cup circuit is
a simple matter of chemistry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing, because we clicked right from the start,'' said
Gordon, the two-time defending NASCAR Winston Cup champion who will
be at New Hampshire International Speedway this weekend to defend
his title in Sunday's Country Music Television 300. ``First time I
ever met him, he saw I could drive a race car and I saw he really
knew a lot about a race car, especially what I wanted in a race
car.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ray's never tried to tell me how to drive a car. He's not the
type of coach who says, `OK, you've got to do this or you've got to
do that.' He just recognizes maybe when I need a little boost or
when I need to be calmed down and lets me drive the car from there
on out.''
</P>
<P>
   Evernham, 41, has been the stabilizing force of Gordon's wildly
successful ride in the 24 car. He was the steward for Gordon's
first two Winston Cup titles in 1995, and in 1997, when Gordon won
a staggering $6,375,658, bolstered by the Winston Million bonus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it means everything _ chemistry,'' Gordon said.
``There are steps along the way that builds that. It just doesn't
come automatic. It comes from good race cars, it comes from good
engines, it comes from good pit stops, and it just builds on each
other.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden, that confidence turns into great chemistry.
But once you have it, it seems like it stays with you for a while.
When you're down, that chemistry holds you together like glue and
never lets you give up. We work really well off each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon will enter Sunday's race with a 67-point lead over Mark
Martin in the Winston Cup standings. He has socked away $3,868,357
in a season that has included eight victories, including four in a
row to tie the modern record. Feeling ill and driving a backup that
admittedly was not one of the best cars in his stable, Gordon went
to Bristol, Tenn., last week trying to win his fifth in a row, but
he finished fifth behind winner Martin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel confident we're going to run good at a lot of tracks,''
said Gordon, who has won twice at NHIS _ in 1994 and in last year's
second Winston Cup whistlestop at the 1-mile oval. ``Right now, our
momentum really hasn't been broken or anything. We're still the
same team.''
</P>
<P>
   While their success on the track has forged a trust and a mutual
respect for each other's enormous talents, it's not as though
Gordon and Evernham are as inseperable as, say, Batman and Robin.
They are more like Felix Unger and Oscar Madison: complete
opposites.
</P>
<P>
   Evernham, a native of Keyport, N.J., is East Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, a native Hoosier from Pittsboro, Ind., is Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   A motorhead through and through, Evernham is a lover of
motorcycles, cars, street rods, anything on wheels that's capable
of going fast.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, said Evernham, ``is a big stick and ball guy, and I'm
not,'' referring to the driver's passion for basketball and golf.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're friends, definitely,'' said Evernham. ``But we're not
friends like everybody thinks. We don't do things socially
together. We don't talk on the phone really much during the week.
We spend our time at the racetrack. It's like having a younger
brother, even though we're basically from two generations.''
</P>
<P>
   Evernham hailing from My Generation.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon from Generation Next.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a good way to describe it,'' Gordon said. ``We just
have a lot of respect for each other. It's hard to describe the
relationship that we have, because we're definitely opposite types
of people. He's very organized and methodical about the way he does
things, and he's very intense about that race car and about that
race team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Me, I'm very intense when I get behind the wheel, but when I'm
not behind the wheel I'm very laidback and relaxed and just let
things kind of roll off my back. But I think his intensity really
makes me work harder and gets the most out of me and I think my
relaxed, laidback attitude kind allows him to get a little more
relaxed and enjoy it.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Evernham, ``We get along real good and we respect one
another. I respect him and how he lives his life, and I think he
respects the way I live my life and how I do my job.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a mutual respect more than anything. We're friends
because of that, not because we have a good time together or
anything. We don't. We're really opposites. If it weren't for the
race car, we probably wouldn't have ever hung out with one another.
The racing brought us together and it's the respect that keeps us
together.''
</P>
<P>
   What does the future for the Dynamic Duo? It seems the next
logical step would be to become partners in their own Winston Cup
team.
</P>
<P>
   But Evernham cuationed, ``I just don't want to be a car owner.
If I wanted to do that, I could do it right now. The ideal
situation would be if I could grow into ownership or part-ownership
here at Hendrick Motorsports. I want to be part of a multicar
operation that has the capablity to dominate the sport.
</P>

   ``To be the owner of a Winston Cup car that ran 10th to 15th
every week, that doesn't interest me. But to be involved with Rick
and Jeff and other people _ I'd rather have a small percentage of
something big that can win races than be 100 percent owner of
something that really doesn't have a shot at winning.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that would hinge on Gordon's involvement in the
venture.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like we are partners right now,'' said Gordon. ``If
that were to continue to go to another level and it'd involve
Hendrick Motorsports, then I'd definitely be for it. For us to go
off on our own and try to own and build a team the caliber of
Hendrick Motorsports would be like taking a step backwards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think as long as we're happy and are able to win races and
championships and get what we want, like we do at Hendrick
Motorsports, then I don't see us going anywhere or wanting to do
anything else. But I can definitely tell you we'd like to be more
involved with Hendrick Motorsports if that opportunity ever came
up. But I just feel like any time I'm in a race car, I want it to
be involved with Ray.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we definitely recognize that we do amazing things
together, and we can continue to do that as long as we stick
together.''

NO NEED TO REPLACE CRAZED CERAMIC TILE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, August 30, 1998)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. The 12-inch-square ceramic tile has been on my kitchen for
five years. Now, five tiles have hairline cracks; it looks like
crazing in the glaze. The tiles were put over 1/2-inch plywood atop
a subfloor with thin-set mortar. Can they be reglazed, or do they
need replacing?
</P>
<P>
   MARY GUERRIERO, Westwood, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. They cannot be reglazed, but they don't need replacing,
either, except for cosmetic reasons. If you can tolerate how they
look, forget about them. The crazing (spider-web-type cracks in the
glaze) is superficial, does not go through the tile, and was caused
by a blow to the tile or a defect.
</P>
<P>
   If you really want to replace them, you have to chip out the
mortar and break up the tile in order to chip it out altogether. Be
sure you find matching tile before chipping. With the tile removed,
chip out any mortar remaining on the floor. Install a new tile with
thin-set mortar or an adhesive caulk, and regrout.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I bought a house with a strong odor of stale smoke. I cleaned
the carpet, and that seems OK, but the smell is coming from the
paneling. Someone suggested washing the paneling with ammonia and
water. I also bought water-based polyurethane varnish, hoping to
seal in the odor. Anything else I can do?
</P>
<P>
   MIKE, from Medfield, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The ammonia and water sounds OK to do because washing the
paneling will do the most good. But instead, I suggest a standard
solution of Spic and Span and water; I think it is still one of the
better cleaners on the market. Wash the paneling thoroughly; the
finish should not be affected, although it might become dull.
Rinse. If that does it, you will not have to seal it.
</P>
<P>
   If you have to seal the paneling, do not use water-based
polyurethane; it is incompatible with the oil-based finish on the
paneling. One coat of a satin finish should do it; before coating
the paneling, sand it lightly to roughen the finish. The paneling
will look terrible after that sanding, but after you wipe it with a
damp cloth and let it dry, the new finish should look very good. I
think brushing is best.
</P>
<P>
   Another good cleaner is paint thinner. Use lots of ventilation
when working with it.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am having a new roof installed. I know I have to have two
layers of shingles on there now removed, but one man said I didn't
need an Ice &AMP; Water Shield because I don't have gutters. One man
said he would put in a ridge vent, another said I didn't need one.
Now I'm all confused.
</P>
<P>
   GINA VILLA, Milford, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. You don't need an Ice &AMP; Water Shield because you don't have
gutters? Wrong. You don't need a ridge vent? Wrong, maybe. OK,
let's explain. An Ice &AMP; Water Shield is a strip of rubberized
material three feet wide that is put on the eave edge of a roof,
under the shingles. It is designed to prevent water dammed by an
ice dam from backing up under the shingles and into the house. An
Ice &AMP; Water shield does not prevent ice dams. It is routinely
installed when a new roof is put on, because it is the state of the
art in roofing, and is easy and inexpensive to do.
</P>
<P>
   The claim that you don't need an Ice &AMP; Water Shield because you
don't have gutters is wrong, because ice dams can form with or
without gutters.
</P>
<P>
   After all that agony, have the Ice &AMP; Water Shield installed.
</P>
<P>
   As for the ridge vent. You may not need one if your attic is
properly ventilated, but you do if it is not. And even if it is
well ventilated, a ridge vent is a good idea, to help air escape
from the attic. A ridge vent is usually done in conjunction with
soffit vents (vents in the underside of the roof overhang), and the
resulting ventilation will help keep the attic cool in summer and
help keep it dry in the winter, two important factors in the health
of a house.
</P>
<P>
   After all that agony, put in the ridge vent; it is best and
easiest to install when the roof is being reshingled. A ridge vent
costs about $10 per foot installed, but is worth it.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. When I cleaned up a white marble mantel with soap and water,
it continued to smell like heating oil. How can I get rid of that
odor?
</P>
<P>
   GEORGE PERESMAN, Newburyport, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Marble is absorbent, so you must use an absorbent material to
pull out the oil, and you must use a solvent to activate the oil in
the marble. So, dampen the marble with paint thinner, and sprinkle
baking soda over it, at least half an inch thick. Let it sit for an
hour (you may see the baking soda turn yellow, which means it is
absorbing the oil). Sweep it up and throw it away. Repeat as
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Repetition is the secret to success. And rest assured it will
work. The handyman spilled some diesel oil in the trunk of his car
years ago during the energy crisis. But he wiped up as much as he
could, then gave everything the baking soda treatment. Eventually,
every trace of oil _ and odor _ was gone. Other absorbents you can
use are Speedy Dry and cat litter. Both are absorbent clays.
</P>
<P>

questions. Write him at the Boston Globe, Boston, Mass., 02107. The

JAPAN IS TO BLAME FOR MUCH OF THIS TOPSY-TURVY MARKET 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LARRY AMERNICK  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERKELEY, Calif. _ While the public watches the disintegration
of Mother Russia, the smart money is focusing on the real culprit
for the latest market troubles: Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Although most analysts blamed Thursday's global market slide on
the Russian economy, the downturn can be traced to the 3 percent
decline in Tokyo's Nikkei average the day before. Stock traders
around the world took that dip as a sign of continuing weakness in
worldwide equities.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, the Asian contagion is infecting us all. In a
nutshell, Japan's inability to resolve internal political conflict
and solve its banking crisis is keeping global markets from
recovering.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese market collapsed because investors were
disappointed by the new government's inability to deal with its
chronic banking problems.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign investors fled Japan to the safe havens of the U.S. and
European markets.
</P>
<P>
   What investors didn't understand was the tight relationship
between European stock markets and financial stability in Russia.
That relationship is very tight due to the massive amounts of money
Europeans have loaned Russia. German banks alone hold over $30
billion of Russian debt.
</P>
<P>
   The recent economic collapse in Russia surprised everyone.
European markets were especially vulnerable. Because of Russia's
collapse, the European markets lost their status as a safe haven
for scared Asian money.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, traders worldwide are losing confidence in equities
and are running to the safety of bonds, which are guaranteed by
governments.
</P>
<P>
   This trend was evident Thursday. In the first hour of Tokyo
trading, the Japanese stock market quickly fell through key support
at 14,774 and proceeded to fall to 14,413.79. A support area, by
definition, is a level where traders are likely to buy back in to
the market.
</P>
<P>
   The flight to quality could be seen in U.S. markets, where the
yield on the U.S. 30-year treasury bond hit a 25-year low,
indicating a mass influx of buyers.
</P>
<P>
   What is behind this global meltdown? Simply, the supply of goods
and services is exceeding the demand.
</P>
<P>
   Since July 1, 1997, demand for goods and services in Asia has
shrunk as those economies suffered from currency devaluations,
higher interest rates, and bank failures. And because Asian
countries were unable to export due to disappearing bank liquidity,
imports into Asia also fell.
</P>
<P>
   What investors need to focus on is the cause for Japan's
problems, the lack of demand which is causing an atmosphere of
deflation. Deflation is an economic condition in which prices
continue to drop. This causes consumers to delay major purchases,
expecting the price reductions to continue. Of course, less
purchasing is bad news for businesses and a downward spiral begins.
</P>
<P>
   Deflation is one reason consumer demand is falling in Japan.
Until the Japanese government implements policies that will
increase consumer demand, such as permanently lowering taxes, the
Japanese stock market will fall.
</P>
<P>
   This deflation fear is vibrating globally. We have not
experienced anything like this since the '30s. In reality, there is
no real deflation in the United States. However, the markets are
forward-looking vehicles that attempt to anticipate future events.
</P>
<P>
   The current breakdown in the Japanese stock market suggests that
additional selling will occur in the South American, Mexican, and
Canadian stock markets. This is the real danger for the future of
the American stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Our greatest trading partners are Canada and Mexico. If their
markets continue to plunge, a recession in those countries will
soon follow, providing further distress for American exports.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. markets can expect to be battered further because it is
likely that corporate earnings estimates will again be lowered for
the fourth quarter of 1998 and first quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Although the current poor action in the U.S. stock markets is
being described as insignificant panic selling, don't believe it.
We're not out of the woods yet.
</P>
<P>
   If the Asian contagion spreads beyond Russia to the emerging
markets in South America, you can expect further weakness in the
American stock market, especially among the huge banks, such as
CitiCorp and Chase Manhattan. Additional selling pressure could
affect companies like Coca-Cola and Merrill Lynch, which are
globally exposed.
</P>
<P>
   How low could the markets fall?
</P>
<P>
   First, the Dow could challenge the 7,700 level and the S&AMP;P 500
could test the 965 area before a meaningful bear market rally
commences. After that, who knows?
</P>

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Shirley Fong-Torres, founder and owner of Wok Wiz Walking Tours
in San Francisco's Chinatown, guides a group of mature travelers
across narrow, bustling Grant Avenue and past Pagoda Gate with its
two stone lions.
 &HT;    ``Notice the curved roof line on many of the buildings,'' she
points out. ``The Chinese are very superstitious. They believe that
evil spirits travel in a straight line. By curving the roofs, evil
spirits stay away.''
 &HT;    Accompanying Fong-Torres' group is our friend, Millie Alexander,
who tells us about the continuing growth of ethnic communities in
the San Francisco area.
 &HT;    Chinatown is a favorite attraction for many first-time visitors
to San Francisco. While they expect to see cable cars, the Golden
Gate Bridge and many different types of boats on the water, ``what
comes as a surprise are the large number of newly arrived
immigrants now living in the City by the Bay,'' Alexander says.
 &HT;    The picturesque 24-block community of Chinatown continues to
provide housing and social interaction for thousands of new Chinese
and Asian immigrants, she says. They love it because it reminds
them so much of home. They love the sound of mah jong tiles
clicking against one another in boisterous games. They love the
pungent smell of healing herbs prescribed by white-coated herb
doctors. And they love the sight of roasted ducks hanging in
restaurant windows, inviting them inside for a delicious meal.
 &HT;    The entire city is a kaleidoscope of ethnic diversity.
 &HT;    The Hispanic culture marks the Mission District, with salsa
music blaring from inside dance clubs. Taquerias serve handmade
tortillas, and colorful murals adorn walls, fences and garages.
 &HT;    On the other side of the hills not far from the ocean is Geary
Street, where the golden onion domes of the Holy Trinity Russian
Orthodox Cathedral bring a touch of home to Russian emigres.
 &HT;    Although they're eager to begin a new life in America, they
still long for familiar foods such as piroshkis and pelmeni. Many
bakeries, delicatessens and restaurants specialize in Russian food
and advertise with signs printed in both English and Cyrillic
letters.
 &HT;    ``We shouldn't be a melting pot in America but a salad bowl,''
says Dorothy Quock, a guide with Wok Wiz Walking Tours. ``Each
culture should keep its ethnic identity, yet still be part of the
mix.''
 &HT;    ``San Francisco has had a long history of accepting (sometimes
reluctantly) different nationalities into its salad bowl,'' says
Alexander, who has lived in the Bay Area for many years. She
explains that since the days of the 1849 Gold Rush, the city has
had mass migrations of Italian fishermen, Chinese railroad workers,
Mexican laborers and, most recently, Vietnamese boat people, all
seeking happiness in the Golden State.
 TOURING THE CITY  
 &HT;    For the visitor, this multi-ethnic flavor presents an
extraordinary sensory experience in sights, sounds and tastes. And
Alexander adds that it's all reachable by buses, streetcars and
cable cars at discounted prices for mature travelers.
 &HT;    Personal guides go to famous neighborhoods such as Pacific
Heights and Telegraph Hill, Castro Street and the Haight Ashbury.
 &HT;    ``Because of its cultural diversity, San Francisco has a flavor
that does not exist in other cities,'' says Thomas Weed, who runs
Tours for One, a personalized guide service, (415) 387-3448. ``I
learn what interests the visitors, and then we go exploring in
those neighborhoods.''
 &HT;    To fully enjoy San Francisco, however, the mature traveler
should bear in mind several facts, says Alexander:
 &HT;    The city is located on the tip of a peninsula with the Pacific
Ocean on one side and San Francisco Bay on the other side. This
means that micro-climates abound, especially during the summer
months. While the sky can be sunny and blue at Pier 39, it may be
gray and foggy at the Cliff House. Consequently, sweaters and
jackets _ even lightweight coats _ are appropriate for the city's
mercurial weather.
 &HT;    San Francisco is also located on 43 hills with Lombard Street
being the steepest and most famous for its eight curves. Cars full
of uneasy passengers carefully navigate these S-turns while more
ambitious pedestrians climb up and down Lombard Street on the
sidewalk stairs.
 &HT;    Not all the city's famous attractions are on hills. Fisherman's
Wharf, Golden Gate Park, Union Square and Ocean Beach are on level
ground that requires comfortable walking shoes. Attractions located
on hilltops are accessible via cable cars, taxi cabs and tour
buses.
 &HT;    For touring other city sights, Muni, the public transit system,
charges visitors ages 65 and older a 35-cent fare instead of $1 to
travel around the city all day.
 SAN FRANCISCO RESOURCES  
 &HT;    Because San Francisco is so popular with visitors, advance hotel
reservations are a must, Alexander warns, adding that in the first
three quarters of 1997, San Francisco hosted 11.4 million visitors.
 &HT;    To help with accommodations, the San Francisco Convention and
Visitors Bureau has a city-wide hotel-reservations service. By
calling toll-free (888) 782-9673, mature travelers can make
reservations at more than 70 hotels. Be sure to inquire about their
senior discounts.
 &HT;    In addition, the visitors bureau has a new Web site,
www.sfvisitor.org, to help visitors plan their trips. The
Information available includes travel tips, frequently asked
questions (FAQs), maps and links to other San Francisco resources
on the Web.
 &HT;    One useful guidebook published by Good Life Publications is
``Good Life San Francisco,'' and purchasers ages 50 and older get
30 percent off.

culture should keep its ethnic identity, yet still be part of the
mix.''
 &HT;    ``San Francisco has had a long history of accepting (sometimes
reluctantly) different nationalities into its salad bowl,'' says
Alexander, who has lived in the Bay Area for many years. She
explains that since the days of the 1849 Gold Rush, the city has
had mass migrations of Italian fishermen, Chinese railroad workers,
Mexican laborers and, most recently, Vietnamese boat people, all
seeking happiness in the Golden State.
 TOURING THE CITY  
 &HT;    For the visitor, this multi-ethnic flavor presents an
extraordinary sensory experience in sights, sounds and tastes. And
Alexander adds that it's all reachable by buses, streetcars and
cable cars at discounted prices for mature travelers.
 &HT;    Personal guides go to famous neighborhoods such as Pacific
Heights and Telegraph Hill, Castro Street and the Haight Ashbury.
 &HT;    ``Because of its cultural diversity, San Francisco has a flavor
that does not exist in other cities,'' says Thomas Weed, who runs
Tours for One, a personalized guide service, (415) 387-3448. ``I
learn what interests the visitors, and then we go exploring in
those neighborhoods.''
 &HT;    To fully enjoy San Francisco, however, the mature traveler
should bear in mind several facts, says Alexander:
 &HT;    The city is located on the tip of a peninsula with the Pacific
Ocean on one side and San Francisco Bay on the other side. This
means that micro-climates abound, especially during the summer
months. While the sky can be sunny and blue at Pier 39, it may be
gray and foggy at the Cliff House. Consequently, sweaters and
jackets _ even lightweight coats _ are appropriate for the city's
mercurial weather.
 &HT;    San Francisco is also located on 43 hills with Lombard Street
being the steepest and most famous for its eight curves. Cars full
of uneasy passengers carefully navigate these S-turns while more
ambitious pedestrians climb up and down Lombard Street on the
sidewalk stairs.
 &HT;    Not all the city's famous attractions are on hills. Fisherman's
Wharf, Golden Gate Park, Union Square and Ocean Beach are on level
ground that requires comfortable walking shoes. Attractions located
on hilltops are accessible via cable cars, taxi cabs and tour
buses.
 &HT;    For touring other city sights, Muni, the public transit system,
charges visitors ages 65 and older a 35-cent fare instead of $1 to
travel around the city all day.
 SAN FRANCISCO RESOURCES  
 &HT;    Because San Francisco is so popular with visitors, advance hotel
reservations are a must, Alexander warns, adding that in the first
three quarters of 1997, San Francisco hosted 11.4 million visitors.
 &HT;    To help with accommodations, the San Francisco Convention and
Visitors Bureau has a city-wide hotel-reservations service. By
calling toll-free (888) 782-9673, mature travelers can make
reservations at more than 70 hotels. Be sure to inquire about their
senior discounts.
 &HT;    In addition, the visitors bureau has a new Web site,
www.sfvisitor.org, to help visitors plan their trips. The
Information available includes travel tips, frequently asked
questions (FAQs), maps and links to other San Francisco resources
on the Web.
 &HT;    One useful guidebook published by Good Life Publications is
``Good Life San Francisco,'' and purchasers ages 50 and older get
30 percent off.
 &HT;    Book tours like Wok Wiz Walking Tours through your hotel.

 &HT;    
 By EVERETT POTTER 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Dozens of new travel guidebooks have recently arrived in
bookstores and on Internet bookstore sites. Here's a selection of
the best.
 &HT;    ``Time Out Dublin,'' edited by Peter Fiennes (Penguin, 1998,
$14.95) is Time Out's first guide to the booming Irish capital.
Hip, street-smart and savvy, it runs the gamut from gay bars to
hurling matches.
 &HT;    Accommodations, from bed &AMP; breakfasts to The Clarence, the chic
hotel owned by the rock band U2, are also well-covered.
 &HT;    There are detailed descriptions of the best pubs, such as
Mulligan's, which offers ``a legendary pint of Guinness _ perhaps
the most celebrated and discussed in the entire town.'' And there
are suggestions for excursions out of Dublin, such as to Thor
Ballylee, home of the poet W.B. Yeats. All told, it's the only
guide that the Dublin-bound should need.
 &HT;    Lonely Planet has published a slew of new guides of late. Among
them are ``The Deep South: Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama'' by Kap
Stann, et al (Lonely Planet, 1998; $19.95), which offers close to
600 pages on plantation mansions, blues clubs and gumbo
restaurants.
 &HT;    Their ``London,'' by Pat Yale (Lonely Planet, 1998; $14.95), is
a much-needed guide to one of the most expensive cities in Europe
and a good source for restaurants and hotels that are easy on the
wallet.
 &HT;    But the best of the lot is ``Chicago,'' by Ryan van Berkmoes
(Lonely Planet, 1998; $15.95), a detailed labor of love.
 &HT;    The author knows his city very well. He's informed, informative
and opinionated. He offers a wry 90-minute tour of the Art
Institute of Chicago.
 &HT;    After watching the Cubs lose, he suggests a stop at Bernie's
Tavern, which ``doesn't jack up its prices on game days to fleece
unsuspecting fans, as the many upscale joints in the neighborhood
do.'' And he advises walking around Chicago as the best way to see
it ``except when huge chunks of windblown sleet are smacking you in
the face.''
 &HT;    Like the smart aleck on the next barstool, van Bermoes is
cranky, funny and obviously loves the Windy City. His book is the
next best thing to a personal tour.
 &HT;    Two books have staked out one of America's most beautiful areas,
the California coast. ``The California Coast; A Traveler's
Companion,'' by Donald B. Neuwirth and John J. Osborn (Countryman
Press, 1998; $17.95) is readable and easy to use.
 &HT;    Besides noting scenic high points, hotels and restaurants, the
book offers profiles of people like Rim Fay, a retired Los Angeles
lifeguard, and Rene Avant, a coast ranger. Pack it for a family
driving tour.
 &HT;    The other guide worth perusing is ``Coastal California,'' by
John Doerper (Compass American Guides/Fodor's, 1998; $19.95). With
photographs by one of America's best-known outdoors photographers,
Galen Rowell, this book is a rich look at the history and the
culture of the area. Birders, wine lovers and sightseers will be
well served by it.
 &HT;    The Compass series is one of the best around for those who crave
well-written background information. But this one also shines with
practical details about hotels and restaurants _ not to mention
tattooed La Jolla surfers, ocean kayakers and the Channel Islands.
 &HT;    With Rowell's stunning photographs and Doerper's sensitive and
intelligent prose, this is an ideal travel guide.
 &HT;    The Compass series has also produced ``Underwater Wonders of the
National Parks,'' by Daniel J. Lenihan and John D. Brooks (Compass
American Guides/Fodor's, 1998; $19.95). Spectacular photography and
a wide range of locations makes this a terrific read.
 &HT;    From Devil's Hole cave in Death Valley to St. John in the U.S.
Virgin Islands, Isle Royale in Lake Superior to Biscayne National
Park in Florida, this book shows a watery side of America's
National Parks that is rarely glimpsed.
 &HT;    Moon Travel Handbooks, noted for their detail and no-nonsense
prose, has recently tackled New England. Their ``Maine Handbook,''
by Kathleen Brandes (Moon, 1998; $18.95) offers a close look at the
state that calls itself ``Vacationland.''
 &HT;    On her top 10 list of attractions, Acadia National Park ranks
first, L.L. Bean's store in Freeport ranks fourth.
 &HT;    She notes that what ``looks like a squished spider on Maine's
license plate is actually, of course, the state's favorite menu
item _ a lobster.''
 &HT;    But Maine's wilderness is what she really loves. Brandes remarks
that ``looking out over Maine from Mt. Katahdin today, as Thoreau
did in 1857, you get a view that is still a mass of green
stretching to the sea, broken by blue lakes and rivers.''
 &HT;    Also deserving a look are ``New Hampshire Handbook,'' by Steve
Lantos (Moon Travel Handbooks, 1998; $18.95) and ``Massachusetts
Handbook,'' by Jeff Perk (Moon Travel Handbooks, 1998; $18.95).
 &HT;    Finally, ``Frommer's San Francisco from $60 a Day,'' by Erika
Lenkert and Matthew R. Poole (Macmillan Travel, 1998; $14.95) is a
find for anyone who's tried to beat the high cost of visiting the
city by the Bay.
 &HT;    Cheap eats? Readers will learn about dim sum at the Hong Kong
Flower Lounge, pizza to go at Golden Boy Pizza in North Beach and
Latino specialties at Pozole in the Castro District.
 &HT;    There are loads of recommendations for cheap sleeps throughout
the city, as well as sightseeing and shopping tips that should
please anyone who's watching their budget in San Francisco.

   &UR; By EVE SCHAENEN &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   These days, when the sun is shining and daylight lingers into
late evening, Berliners are outside talking about their city. The
question is always the same, accompanied by a sweeping gesture
toward the crane or bulldozer inevitably positioned nearby: ``You
think it will work?''
</P>
<P>
   For the visitor interested in urban development, contemporary
architecture or, indeed, world history, Berlin is a veritable candy
store for the mind. All over town the city's physical past is being
confronted, restored, reshaped or at times obliterated to make way
for the 21st-century capital.
</P>
<P>
   There is the newly transplanted heart at Potsdamer Platz, where
the steel-and-glass towers of Sony and Daimler Benz near
completion. The area was the commercial center of prewar Berlin _
but it was also the site of Hitler's bunker, of the wall and the
mined no man's land behind it.
</P>
<P>
   There is the Reichstag, birthplace of the Weimar democracy in
1918, but also the setting for the infamous fire used by the Nazis
to seize power in 1933. Refashioned by Sir Norman Foster, the
British architect, the building will once again house the German
Parliament in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   On a less monumental scale, there is the old Jewish quarter in
the Mitte district. Due to conflicting claims, much of the area was
off limits to investors after the wall fell, resulting in a
squatters' paradise and a flourishing subculture that left its mark
in the neighborhood's trendy galleries, clubs and restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Yet all this is just the sideshow. For in reclaiming its status
as government capital, Berlin is determined to reclaim its 1920s
role as cultural capital of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The city boasts three state-subsidized opera houses, five
symphony orchestras and three ballet companies. Some 15,000 seats
are available nightly for concerts and musical theater. And a
dizzying array of privately sponsored alternative performances and
exhibitions recall Berlin's history as home to the avant-garde.
 &UR; EVENTS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   From Sept. 2 through Oct. 5 the 48th annual Berlin Festival
Weeks will focus on Vienna from 1750 to 1950. Claudio Abbado will
conduct the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra in the opening concert,
an evening of Wolfgang Rihm and Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. The
festival box office is at 48 Budapesterstrasse; information and
tickets: (49-30) 254 89254, fax (49-30) 254 89111.
</P>
<P>
   For those who enjoy their Viennese music in a somewhat less
conventional setting, the director Georg Tabori and the Circus
Roncalli are staging ``The Magic Flute: Mozart's Opera in the
Circus With Elephants, Goats, Apes and other Collaborators.''
Performances are Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday at 7 p.m.,
Sunday at 6 p.m. through Sept. 23. Tickets are available at
Fullhouse Service, 48 Budapesterstrasse, or at the circus box
office, 111 Friedrichstrasse. Tickets from $9.80 to $59, calculated
at 1.73 marks to the dollar: (49-30) 254 89254.
</P>
<P>
   Opening Sept. 30, the National Gallery in the Hamburger Bahnhof,
50-51 Invalidenstrasse, (49-30) 397 8340, presents ``Sensation,''
works by young British artists from the Charles Saatchi Collection.
The show made waves at the Royal Academy of Arts in London. Hours:
Tuesday through Friday, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Saturday and Sunday, 11
a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission: $4.60. Tickets for ``Sensation'' are
$6.95.
</P>
<P>
   The first Berlin Biennale opens Sept. 29 with ``Berlin/Berlin.''
Over 70 artists, architects, filmmakers, musicians and designers
who have worked in Berlin will participate in the interdisciplinary
event.
</P>
<P>
   Installations, videos, photographs and paintings will be shown
in three historic buildings in Mitte: the Academy of Arts at
Pariser Platz (next to the Brandenburg Gate); the former
Postfuhramt, 17-19 Tucholsky Strasse; and the Kunst-Werke art
center, 69 Auguststrasse. Hours: Tuesday through Thursday, and
Sunday, 10 a.m. to 8 p.m.; Friday and Saturday, 10 a.m. to
midnight. Telephone: (49-30) 285 99148. The Biennale closes Jan. 3.
 &UR; SIGHTSEEING &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The best way to immerse oneself in the rhythm of Berlin is to
step into its noisy unfinished center. Emerge from the Potsdamer
Platz S-Bahn station to a sky filled with 30 cranes, lifting,
swiveling, loads dangling.
</P>
<P>
   Two-and-a-half-hour tours through the construction sites at
Potsdamer and Leipziger Platz are given as part of the ``Showcase
Berlin'' summer program. The English-language tour (No. 9) begins
Thursday at 10:30 a.m. through Sept. 3. Tickets ($9.85) can be
bought beneath the Info Box building by the S-Bahn station.
</P>
<P>
   If Potsdamer Platz offers a glimpse at Berlin's self-styled
future, Tacheles, 54-56 Oranienburger Strasse, bears witness to the
city's disappearing past.
</P>
<P>
   Built in 1909 as part of a noble shopping passage connecting the
Friedrichstrasse to the Oranienburger Strasse, the building was
scheduled for demolition in 1990 when an idealistic group of East
and West German artists occupied the space.
</P>
<P>
   This autumn may be the last chance to visit the ruin in its
dilapidated glory. The artists expect to be evicted before the end
of the year by the new investors, who have presented plans to
integrate the space into a larger commercial complex.
</P>
<P>
   A short walk into the heart of the old Jewish quarter leads to
the Hackeschen Hofe, 40-41 Rosenthaler Strasse, eight connecting
Jugendstil buildings and courtyards that successfully combine the
public life of cafes, galleries, clubs and fashion boutiques with
private housing.

Kulturforum, Kemperplatz, (49-30) 2090 55 55, unites some 1,000

natural overhead light. Open Tuesday through Friday 10 a.m. to 6
p.m. Thursday until 8 p.m., weekends from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.

   The Allied Museum, in the former American military movie theater
at 135 Clayallee, offers a multimedia depiction of the history of
Berlin and the Allies from 1945 to 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Among the items on display are an original raisin bomber from
the Berlin airlift, the Checkpoint Charlie house and a piece of the
wall. Open daily except Wednesday, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; (49-30) 818

</P>
<P>
   These days, when the sun is shining and daylight lingers into
late evening, Berliners are outside talking about their city. The
question is always the same, accompanied by a sweeping gesture
toward the crane or bulldozer inevitably positioned nearby: ``You
think it will work?''
</P>
<P>
   For the visitor interested in urban development, contemporary
architecture or, indeed, world history, Berlin is a veritable candy
store for the mind. All over town the city's physical past is being
confronted, restored, reshaped or at times obliterated to make way
for the 21st-century capital.
</P>
<P>
   There is the newly transplanted heart at Potsdamer Platz, where
the steel-and-glass towers of Sony and Daimler Benz near
completion. The area was the commercial center of prewar Berlin _
but it was also the site of Hitler's bunker, of the wall and the
mined no man's land behind it.
</P>
<P>
   There is the Reichstag, birthplace of the Weimar democracy in
1918, but also the setting for the infamous fire used by the Nazis
to seize power in 1933. Refashioned by Sir Norman Foster, the
British architect, the building will once again house the German
Parliament in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   On a less monumental scale, there is the old Jewish quarter in
the Mitte district. Due to conflicting claims, much of the area was
off limits to investors after the wall fell, resulting in a
squatters' paradise and a flourishing subculture that left its mark
in the neighborhood's trendy galleries, clubs and restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Yet all this is just the sideshow. For in reclaiming its status
as government capital, Berlin is determined to reclaim its 1920s
role as cultural capital of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The city boasts three state-subsidized opera houses, five
symphony orchestras and three ballet companies. Some 15,000 seats
are available nightly for concerts and musical theater. And a
dizzying array of privately sponsored alternative performances and
exhibitions recall Berlin's history as home to the avant-garde.
 &UR; EVENTS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   From Sept. 2 through Oct. 5 the 48th annual Berlin Festival
Weeks will focus on Vienna from 1750 to 1950. Claudio Abbado will
conduct the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra in the opening concert,
an evening of Wolfgang Rihm and Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. The
festival box office is at 48 Budapesterstrasse; information and
tickets: (49-30) 254 89254, fax (49-30) 254 89111.
</P>
<P>
   For those who enjoy their Viennese music in a somewhat less
conventional setting, the director Georg Tabori and the Circus
Roncalli are staging ``The Magic Flute: Mozart's Opera in the
Circus With Elephants, Goats, Apes and other Collaborators.''
Performances are Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday at 7 p.m.,
Sunday at 6 p.m. through Sept. 23. Tickets are available at
Fullhouse Service, 48 Budapesterstrasse, or at the circus box
office, 111 Friedrichstrasse. Tickets from $9.80 to $59, calculated
at 1.73 marks to the dollar: (49-30) 254 89254.
</P>
<P>
   Opening Sept. 30, the National Gallery in the Hamburger Bahnhof,
50-51 Invalidenstrasse, (49-30) 397 8340, presents ``Sensation,''
works by young British artists from the Charles Saatchi Collection.
The show made waves at the Royal Academy of Arts in London. Hours:
Tuesday through Friday, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Saturday and Sunday, 11
a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission: $4.60. Tickets for ``Sensation'' are
$6.95.
</P>
<P>
   The first Berlin Biennale opens Sept. 29 with ``Berlin/Berlin.''
Over 70 artists, architects, filmmakers, musicians and designers
who have worked in Berlin will participate in the interdisciplinary
event.
</P>
<P>
   Installations, videos, photographs and paintings will be shown
in three historic buildings in Mitte: the Academy of Arts at
Pariser Platz (next to the Brandenburg Gate); the former
Postfuhramt, 17-19 Tucholsky Strasse; and the Kunst-Werke art
center, 69 Auguststrasse. Hours: Tuesday through Thursday, and
Sunday, 10 a.m. to 8 p.m.; Friday and Saturday, 10 a.m. to
midnight. Telephone: (49-30) 285 99148. The Biennale closes Jan. 3.

NOW IT'S TIME TO SAY GOOD-BYE 
By Dale Peck 
Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux, 458 pp., $25 
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dale Peck's ``Now It's Time To Say Good-bye'' is a strong stew
of a novel, and its ingredients are unlikely companions _ baroque
inventiveness, Jacobean tragedy, gothic grotesquerie, American
regional realism, &UR;  &LR; the postmodern European novel, &UR;  &LR; ``Dr.
Strangelove,'' ``Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil,'' and
Stephen King, more literate but hardly kinder, gentler.
</P>
<P>
   Peck, the author of two previous, highly praised novels, ``The
Law of Enclosures'' and ``Martin and John,'' has set this one in
Kansas, where he grew up. The town is Galatia (it's on the map,
although Cadavera County is not), an African-American town that has
now been taken over by Galatea, a white community that moved in
when nearby Kenosha burned down.
</P>
<P>
   The story of the town and of its people is told in a polyphony
of many voices, some of them speaking out of turn, and at least one
from beyond the grave. Justin Time and his lover Colin Nieman have
fled to Kansas; they are burnt out by the AIDS epidemic in New York
_ 500 of their friends have died. Their Kansas connection is a
painter named Wade Painter, who keeps company with a black hustler
who works the local truckstop and calls himself Divine. The
formidable Rosemary Krebs likes to think she runs the town; the
minister Abraham Greeving is the custodian of its history.
Greeving's daughter Webbie has come home to take care of him, but
yearns for escape.
</P>
<P>
   The town is full of hostile divisions of sexual identity and
race, and everyone seems to have a past and a secret. ``What every
prostitute learns sooner or later,'' Justin, who has been a
prostitute himself observes, ``is that most people have only one
secret, and that secret is whom they truly love.'' There has been a
lynching; before the townspeople have finished telling their
stories there has been rape, other couplings violent and tender,
arson, severed thumbs and fingertips, and several murders. The pigs
have feasted on a man, been shot, and served in a barbecue on
Founder's Day.
</P>
<P>
   Law and order are represented by the mayor, Rosemary Krebs's
ineffectual husband, by the overweight mailman who eats a dozen
eggs for breakfast (cooked in a quarter-inch of bacon fat), and by
the literal minded Sheriff Eustace (Lawman) Brown. Art imposes
different forms of order. Colin writes a novel about the town, and
Wade has drawn and painted the town and its residents most of his
life. Justin, it turns out, wrote Colin's most famous book, and
begins to paint by reproducing some of Wade's drawings. There are
also magical forces at work in the land.
</P>
<P>
   Justin appears to be the presiding consciousness; at least he
introduces the story and survives its end. But after he witnesses a
brutal rape and survives an attack, he falls silent for most of the
rest of the book _ but not before delivering a Joycean vision to
the baffled Lawman Brown. ``He finished with Lucy, finished her,
ruined her, ended her, he lifted her to the sky and he showed her
to me and he showed himself to me and showed me to me, he showed us
all ourselves and then he fell on me, he did and Lucy did, Lucy who
was in his arms and I who was on the ground and then I was gone,
and when I opened my eyes he was gone, and Lucy was gone, and I was
gone again, and gone forever.''
</P>
<P>
   It's difficult to know what to make of ``Now It's Time To Say
Good-bye.'' It is horrifing and funny and then too funny to be
horrifying, or too horrifying to amuse. It is fiercely compelling
and profoundly unpleasant. It is a virtuoso technical exercise that
is also soul-music.. Kansas is as real as a town on a map and far
more fantastic than Oz _ we're not in Kansas any more, but in the
farthest reaches of the human psyche. The author's dedication
prefigures the tone of the novel: ``I wouldn't wish this book on
anyone, except maybe (a couple of friends).'' There is no place
that Dale Peck is afraid to go, but what he takes for granted about
human nature is just as astonishing. He does show us all of
ourselves, even if we don't want to believe.

`CHAMBERMAID' IGNITES IMAGINATION WITH FANTASY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
THE CHAMBERMAID 
Directed by: Bigas Luna 
Screenplay by: Luna, Cuca Canals, Jean-Louis Benoit (novel: Didier
Decoin) 
Starring: Romane Bohringer, Olivier Martinez, Aitana Sanchez-Gijon,
Didier Bezace, Aldo Maccione 
Running time: 96 minutes 
Rating: Unrated 
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bigas Luna's ``The Chambermaid'' won't be seen by more than a
small fraction of the worldwide audience for James Cameron's
``Titanic.'' But of the two films with a Titanic motif, it's the
one to see. Where Cameron's film was pulp fiction, Luna's far more
imaginative work expands as it toys with the notion of what art is
and how it comes about. Its two lovers only spend a night together,
and may or may not have had sex. And they never board the doomed
liner. They only join the dockside crowd seeing it off from
Southampton. But those tendrils of circumstance are all Luna and
his cast need to spin a beguiling tale about imagination ignited by
fantasy and longing.
</P>
<P>
   It begins in a grimy French factory town in 1912, with Olivier
Martinez's foundry worker named Horty winning a race and receiving
as first prize a ticket to Southampton and a hotel room there so he
can see the Titanic depart. The catch is that there's only one
ticket, and the boss has his eye on Martinez's pretty wife, Zoe
(Romane Bohringer). With misgivings, Horty leaves. No sooner has he
settled into his hotel room than there's a knock on the door. When
he opens it, a beautiful woman asks him to come to her rescue.
</P>
<P>
   She's a chambermaid on the Titanic (the film's original title),
she tells him. But before she can report for duty the next morning,
the woman named Marie (Aitana Sanchez-Gijon) needs a place to sleep
and all the hotels are full. Horty gives her his bed, which she
offers to share. Is the love scene that follows the real thing or a
dream? We're not quite sure. All we see is the two of them leave
the next morning and make their way toward the great ocean liner.
En route, Horty has Marie photographed.
</P>
<P>
   When he returns home, Zoe, who also works at the foundry, tells
him she has been promoted. Suspicious and angry, he storms off and
takes to drinking with his cronies. When he hears that the Titanic
has sunk, he produces the photograph of Marie, and begins
embellishing the story of their night together. By the time he's
through, he has everyone believing they enjoyed a night of mad
passion on the liner itself. The story plays well _ except to Zoe.
It attracts crowds.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, Horty finds himself attached to a traveling troupe as its
romantic troubadour. He tells Zoe the story of grand doomed passion
is fiction, but the more he reassures her, the less she believes
him. Now it's her turn to be jealous. Deftly, Bigas Luna works his
way around to an unpredictable and satisfying climax, but while the
external events of ``The Chambermaid'' are engrossing, the thing
that gives it resonance is its meditation on the ways of
imagination.
</P>
<P>
   Does Horty's story represent the prostitution of experience? Or
do his distortions add up to an artist's fusing of desire and
inspiration? Is artistic creation a lie that tells deeper truths
than facts alone can tell? The film is too securely rooted in its
characters and Bigas Luna's hand is too sophisticated to ever allow
his film to evaporate into an arid philosophical debate. We always
feel there's a lot riding on the way events transpire here. But the
playfulness with which the larger issues dance alongside them is
what makes ``The Chambermaid'' the elegant and altogether
stimulating delight it is.

A SKIN-DEEP LOOK AT DOO-WOP STAR LYMON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
WHY DO FOOLS FALL IN LOVE 
Directed by: Gregory Nava 
Screenplay by: Tina Andrews 
Starring: Halle Berry, Viveca Vivica A. Fox, Lela Rochon, Larenz
Tate, Little Richard, Paul Mazursky 
Running time: 115 minutes 
Rated: R (language and some sexuality) 
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Why Do Fools Fall in Love,'' pushing off from the short,
chaotic life of doo-wop single-hit-sensation Frankie Lymon, plays
like a posthumous ``Waiting to Exhale.'' It's filled with color and
energy. The musical stagings, including the title song, are on the
money, especially when the real-life Little Richard does his thing.
The leads deliver performances of size and pop icon dimension. But
the film, like Lymon's life, can't conceal the fact that it's a bit
of a hodge-podge that never really illuminates its subject,
settling instead for lively iconography.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Gregory Nava's film is more ambitious than the usual
Hollywood biopic. It begins where most other biopics end, years
after Lymon's death from a heroin overdose at 25, when Diana Ross
cuts a version of Lymon's big hit that gives the film its name, and
it's realized that there's still a lot of money to be made in
royalties. The fun begins when one widow surfaces, then a second,
then a third.
</P>
<P>
   Before long, they're fighting it out in court to see who gets
the money _ assuming they can pry it away from Paul Mazursky's
record label owner who stole most of it with the ball point pen he
used to persuade the naive Lymon to sign his rights away. If
nothing else, the film makes abundantly clear that Lymon got the
girls while Mazursky's sleazeball got the money. And not only did
Lymon get the girls. He married them, heedless of the legalities
involved.
</P>
<P>
   The question of who his legal widow might be is complicated by
the fact that two of the women left a few legal strings untied
themselves. As the two more flamboyant ones, Halle Berry and Vivica
J. Fox have the most fun and are the most fun to watch. Berry
enjoys a stretch as Zola Taylor, the singer who as a member of The
Platters was just as prominent as Lymon, lasted longer, and
survived Frankie leaving her broke. Fox strikes off into new
territory, too, as the second wife, who loved Frankie enough after
his career fell apart to turn to prostitution when his drug habit
took over.
</P>
<P>
   Lela Rochon's third wife, a Georgia schoolteacher Frankie met
and charmed while in the service after being drafted, could have
fallen into the goody-two-shoes trap. But she projects enough
strength of her own to make the other two realize she's a
formidable opponent, too. Larenz Tate's Frankie, who broke through
in 1955 at the age of 13, is persuasive as the charismatic little
guy who charmed all three on his way to trigamy and worse.
</P>
<P>
   But Tina Andrews's script never really gets under Frankie's skin
to convince us we're seeing him portrayed from the inside. We never
feel the rush of Frankie's instant stardom, followed by his pain
and bewilderment as he slides downhill, unable to know what to do
to stop it, or how to find in his offstage life the kind of high he
feels onstage. The women are much better at portraying survival
skills than pain, and the film is juiciest when it finally lets
them interact. Certainly, it's dynamic and colorful and winningly
performed.
</P>
<P>
   It's also candid about the way record biz execs ripped off their
singers (Mazursky's larcenous exploiter wisely is played in low-key
style) and wryly ironic about the way the court case plays out. But
in the end it never gives us a more than emblematic look at Lymon.
Nava's skill at image-making is richly and, when it has to be,
garishly apparent. But ``Why Do Fools Fall in Love'' plays like a
series of postcards from the heady rise and fall of teen singing
sensation Lymon _ and from the exhilaration and suffering caused by
his sad rudderlessness.

NISSAN FRONTIER A YEAR OLD AND ALREADY CHANGED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)  
 (For release Sunday, August 30, 1998)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN R.WHITE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Frontier, introduced as a 1998 model, is a simple truck from
Nissan _ actually a line of simple little pickups, starting with
the standard cab equipped with basic 5-speed manual transmission,
rear-drive, and a four-cylinder engine with a sticker price under
$12,000. With the $470 delivery charge, it works out to $12,460 to
put a bottom-feeder Nissan Frontier in your driveway _ and there
isn't much dicker in that sticker. The dealer markup reflected in
that price is hardly enough to make it worthwhile taking it off the
delivery truck and mounting the hubcaps.
</P>
<P>
   The line spirals upward from there, ascending a series of steps
reflecting increased equipment, power, size, price _ and dealer
profit potential; you can have 4WD, king cab, automatic
transmission, V-6 engine, lots of bells and whistles, yet the top
sticker is still under $21K. This now; stand by for changes.
</P>
<P>
   With the '99 model year, that Standard model disappears in favor
of a new base XE grade, presumably priced somewhat more than the
old Standard but less than the '98 XE $13,190 bottom model.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, I met and liked the 1998 4-cylinder version
of Frontier; lately I have had more time in a top-of-the-line SE
4WD King Cab _ a '99 with the 170-horsepower V-6, four-speed
automatic gearbox, air conditioning, and all the ... well, this SE
didn't have all the bells and whistles. In '98, the SE came with
power mirrors, power locks, and power windows; the '99 SE came with
armstrong power _ manual window cranks and manual locks. The
mirrors appeared to be the power option, but, if so, somebody had
neglected to install the power control. One had to resort to
``digital'' control _ pushing with the fingers.
</P>
<P>
   The '99 sample is a prototype, not a production model.
Prototypes come through with the latest in what's new, but
sometimes the carryover stuff, the equipment that remains
unchanged, suffers in the rush to build the prototype _ whatever's
handy gets installed. That was my theory, anyway, but the fact is
that the SE for '99 comes standard with all that manual stuff.
Power windows, locks, mirrors and remote entry are offered as an
optional ``Power Package'' in '99.
</P>
<P>
   The prototype, by the way, isn't certified, can't be registered,
and so can't be sold; this nifty little truck will likely end its
brief career in a crusher, although some prototype vehicles wind up
in schools as teaching aids.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of offering this prototype for evaluation was to
give the writer a sense of the powertrain, that new V-6 engine in
particular. My sense is that this sparsely trimmed little truck,
after driving a long string of luxury-oriented vehicles and a
couple of heavy hauler trucks, was akin to a refreshing glass of
seltzer after too much rich food _ oh what a relief it was.
</P>
<P>
   Incipient arthritis does make a manual window crank a bit more
than a nuisance, and I recommend remote locking devices for
safety's sake, but the whole of the truck just set right, felt
good. The engine is powerful in this modest-sized vehicle, offers
good acceleration, decent torque to start a load moving, and
certainly wasn't overwhelmed by the juice drive.
</P>
<P>
   The handling was good for a light truck, improves somewhat with
a load. The light rear of an empty pickup naturally wants to come
around to meet the grille in very hard braking, and a high center
of gravity sets the Frontier to leaning on sharp turns. But the
Frontier behaved rather well; the rear end never did swing out, and
although the feeling of security became a little tentative as
centrifugal force tried to push it over in the hard corners, no
wheels lifted from the pavement, and the track was true to the
steering desired.
</P>
<P>
   Air conditioning is standard on the SE, and the air conditioner
in this baby, prototype or not, was Chill City, a most welcome bit
of comfort on a hot, sticky day. The glove box is minuscule. Two
key-shaped cupholders lie between the armrest _ which conceals a
square, covered bin _ and the shifter; the holders have removable
rubber inserts. Another pair sits behind the bin for the rear
passengers _ as if they will have room to drink.
</P>
<P>
   The King Cab, in this writer's opinion, is overstating the case
for room. If this be royal room, it might rank as earl or baron,
but king it is not. Jump seats fold out from the sides of the
truck; you sit with your knees facing the other passenger, and
you'd best be small passengers on a short trip. But, with the seats
folded up out of the way, there is room to put a lot of stuff
behind the front seats _ the seats slide forward to provide fairly
easy access to that rear room. Bring the tuba, the tools, the gun
rack, and fishing tackle _ I'd estimate six cases of wine fit back
there, or a couple of trunks.
</P>
<P>
   The cargo box was fitted with the optional $299 bedliner, and
tiedown loops were easily accessible through cutouts _ they are in
the corners near the top of the box. Towing capacity with the V-6,
by the way, is 5,000 pounds _ nice truck for hauling a small boat.
Fuel mileage worked out to a hair better than 19 miles per gallon
over about 560 miles measured.
</P>
<P>
   There are lots of pickup trucks out there in a variety of sizes.
I can't tell you this is the best of the lot _ it isn't _ but I can
tell you that it's a very good light truck, and this particular
rendition hit me right. I really, really liked it.

COLLINS CRAFTS HIS COMEDY INSIDE AND OUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL BLOWEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bobby Collins grew up eating baloney sandwiches and powdered
milk in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was brought up on baloney and liverwurst _ I actually
thought liverwurst was real meat,'' he says from his home on Long
Island where he's putting the finishing touches on some new
material. ``It's the kind of food that gives you a heart attack
before you even finish the sandwich.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins, who was named Bobby after Bob Hope, is a throwback
comedian defined, in some way, by what he doesn't do. He doesn't
string jokes together or deliver them like he was shooting the
enemy with a submachine gun. He's not a shock guy, using vulgarity
to hammer home a joke.
</P>
<P>
   Basically, his material is adult without being offensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was a kid we used to watch Red Skelton and I looked
over at my father on the couch laughing at Skelton and I thought,
even then, how much I'd like to make people laugh,'' says Collins,
who understood early on that no matter what the economic
circumstances, a good laugh is a good laugh. ``I thought if I could
do that I could be happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Is he?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yea, I'm about as happy as you can get in this crazy
business,'' says the comic commentator whose CD, ``On the Inside,''
was nominated for an Emmy last year. He lost out to his good
friend, Jeff Foxworthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned a lot opening for people,'' he says. ``I opened for
Sinatra, Julio Iglesias, and Cher,'' he says. ``The best. Not
because of the way they entertained _ although that was great, too
_ but because of the way they acted. The way they got rid of their
own egos. Some entertainers love to berate musicians at rehearsals.
I don't want to mention any names, but I also opened for Dolly
Parton. Anyway, when Julio or Cher or Frank wanted to make a point,
they always waited until an appropriate time and took the person
aside. It was a sign that they didn't need to berate others to make
themselves seem big.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Collins's angles is to describe the inside and outside of
a particular situation. For example, his wife wants to go shopping
to Sam's Club. Outside, Collins is saying something like, ``Yes,
dear.'' Inside, he's saying, ``Shopping? Shopping sucks.''
</P>
<P>
   While Collins has been under contract for situation comedies on
the major networks, he's not as interested in making it on
television as he used to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, riding around on the corporate jet and making the
big money is appealing,'' he says. ``But they make you do things
you don't want to do. I'm working on one now, but I won't do it
unless I have the ability to change material and cast the show and
have my hand in it. I'm perfectly happy coming in for a weekend and
making 15 grand. What's wrong with that?''
</P>
<P>
   It certainly beats baloney and liverwurst.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly does,'' says Collins. ``And it's my own material.
It's a great job.''

MECCA OF COOL TURNS OUT LUKEWARM IN `54' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
54 
Directed and written by: Mark Christopher 
Starring: Ryan Phillippe, Mike Myers, Salma Hayek, Breckin Meyer,
Neve Campbell, Sela Ward, Ellen Dow, Sherry Stringfield, Heather
Matarazzo 
Rated: R (sexuality, drug use and language) 
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``54'' isn't the film it should have been, but it's easy enough
to watch _ which is one of the reasons it isn't the film it should
have been. Essentially, it's a pared-down piece of soft-centered
nostalgia for a glittery era that went into overdrive, then
self-destructed. The story of the social forces swirling around
Studio 54, Manhattan's foremost anything-goes disco of the '70s,
calls for nothing less than the multi-skeined bite of a
``Nashville.'' What we get is more like ``Noshville.'' The cursory,
perfunctory ``54'' doesn't bite off nearly enough. The smallish
morsel it does settle for too readily accepts at face value Steve
Rubell's smiling declaration that he just wanted to ``throw the
best damned party the world has ever seen and make it last
forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Myers's portrayal of Rubell, who parlayed a steakhouse in
Brooklyn into the '70s mecca of cool, is the best thing in the
film. Like most good comics, his mimetic skills and timing are on
the money, especially when he's stoned and blissfully invites the
attentions of the IRS and other government agencies by not
bothering to conceal money-skimming and on-site drug dealing. When
one patron ODs and dies on the dance floor, Rubell mutters
something about having lost a friend, rationalizes her death away
by declaring that she couldn't handle her drugs, then switches his
attention to what really mattered most to him at the moment, namely
that Princess Grace, spotted on the premises, shouldn't be kept
waiting for drinks.
</P>
<P>
   Myers's Rubell floats druggily in and out of sexual confusion,
making a pass at a waiter as his bodyguard hauls him, all but
passed out, home to his bed. When the young working class waiter
awkwardly tries to fend off the pass by declaring that he isn't
gay, Myers's Rubell, replies, just before literally vomiting on his
money, ``Oh! Labels.'' But Rubell could not have been as
consistently oblivious as the film makes him out to be in,
presumably, its desire to stay away from darker areas so the
central character would appear more viewer-friendly. Leaving the
central theme largely unexplored in its rush to boil things down to
a personalized temptation story, it's left to a voiceover to
explain that Rubell was the first to notice the switch to a
celebrity culture. He made access to the club raise Manhattan's
collective anxiety level, by granting entry only to those deemed
cool enough to hurdle the velvet rope.
</P>
<P>
   We're told Rubell enjoyed power-tripping on the right side of
the rope, reminding the doorman who really was boss. Here, he's
mostly a pussycat, spacy, cuddly, smiling his toothy, lopsided
smile mostly to himself, guilty only of carelessness. This softens
the conflict, simplistically corny as it is, between bright lights
and the sentimentalized solid moral values of the working class, as
personified by Ryan Phillippe's refugee from Jersey City, Shane
O'Shea. Shane can't believe his good fortune when he's admitted to
the club after his friends are excluded, then gets a job as a
waiter, then a bartender. Celeb status rubs off on him, and it goes
to his head. The film plays like a cleaned-up version of ``The
Rake's Progress,'' taking place over 10 different nights during
which, presumably, the fate of Shane's tarnished but essentially
pure soul will be decided.
</P>
<P>
   He's flanked by another salt-of-the-earth working-class couple,
Breckin Meyer's waiter and Salma Hayek's coat check girl hoping to
use the job as a launch pad to a singing career. Meanwhile, the
parade of jaded decadents weaves through the place, occasionally
nibbling at the newcomer with the curly hair and the highly defined
and visible abs. Phillippe does little to indicate a quantum leap
beyond hunk du jour status. True, Shane mostly just stands around
with his face hanging out, wondering first what to make of it all,
then wondering how to exploit it.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he doesn't leap off the screen the way Mark Wahlberg's
very similar character did in ``Boogie Nights,'' which bathed the
porn industry in the same rosy glow that this film bathes the disco
sniffery. He's handsome, but so expressionless that it's not yet
possible to tell what he can do. But he's hot enough to have been
cast in at least three upcoming films, so we'll soon know more.
Considering that he last was seen hanging on the wrong end of a
steel hook in ``I Know What You Did Last Summer,'' this role
represents, one supposes, advancement.
</P>
<P>
   The woman of Shane's dreams, partly because she made it out of
New Jersey to become a soap opera regular, is played by Neve
Campbell, who raises the film's wholesomeness quotient. But it's
Myers's face, smiling a zonked-out smile that presumably takes its
cue from the club's hanging sculpture of the man in the moon and
the big cocaine spoon suspended beside him, that you remember from
the hazy, glossed-over ``54.'' Writer-director Mark Christopher is
much better at making images than he is at writing, or filling
those images with emotional impact or a sardonic point of view. No
edge or danger comes off the screen. The whole of ``54'' hasn't a
fraction of the wit in any five minutes of Whit Stillman's less
lurid but more poignant ``The Last Days of Disco.'' In short,
there's more fizzle than fizz in this slick-looking but superficial
excursion. If the atmosphere was as benign as it is here, what was
all the fuss about?

VIDEO INTERVIEWS MAY HAVE BEEN JUST A FAD 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By L.M. SIXEL 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Three years ago, college recruiters were abuzz over new
technology that would allow them to conduct closed-circuit job
interviews.
</P>
<P>
   With the technology, companies could interview prospective
employees thousands of miles away without having to incur the
expense of traveling to a campus, staying in a hotel and buying
meals.
</P>
<P>
   But the trend never caught on. Only a few companies invested in
the technology. And many employers still want to shake an
applicant's hand.
</P>
<P>
   It's surprising, said David Small, who expected real-time video
interviewing would be the wave of the future. Small, director of
career services at the University of Houston, invested $5,000 in
equipment that made the University of Houston a virtual pioneer
three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Today, only about four or five students each semester use the
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   It's a similar story at the University of Texas at El Paso.
Students use the video equipment about 10 times a year, said Briane
Carter, director of career services.
</P>
<P>
   Carter said universities were quick to jump on the trend because
they tend to embrace technology. Private companies, on the other
hand, aren't quite so fast to adopt, especially human resource
departments that drive much of the initial recruiting efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Human resources officials also are not the final employment
decision makers, Carter said, and line managers don't take kindly
to the idea that they can't meet prospective employees
face-to-face.
</P>
<P>
   That said, there are areas in which video interviewing is taking
off. Organizations that already have sophisticated technology in
place and are used to communicating electronically with other
offices have adapted their technology for video interviewing,
Carter said. School districts, for example, have adapted equipment
they own to communicate with schools.
</P>
<P>
   And government agencies accustomed to technology, such as the
Defense Department and intelligence-related agencies, use their
equipment to interview candidates for short-term internships and to
initially screen job applicants, she said.
</P>
<P>
   John Hannabach thinks it's too early to write the obituary for
video interviewing. Hannabach, director of career services at
Georgia Tech in Atlanta, estimates that 50 to 60 companies across
the nation are using their computer equipment for video
interviewing but many more could easily adapt the technology they
are already using to conduct on-camera meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Hannabach speculates that video interviewing really will take
off when the economy turns down. Video interviews are cheap, he
said. With some systems, the cost is nothing more than a
long-distance phone call.
</P>
<P>
   But some recruiters who have used video interviewing in the past
aren't too sure it's anything more than a passing fancy.
</P>
<P>
   Jane Howze, managing director of the Alexander Group in Houston,
has interviewed job candidates by video when she's been under a
tight time deadline. But it's not very satisfying, she said.
</P>
<P>
   A recruiter's job is to entice a job candidate to consider the
recruiter's client as a good place to work, Howze said. ``It's hard
to sell people over a TV set,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   And it was expensive, said Howze, who went to a copy shop in her
neighborhood that had the technology and paid about $350 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Howze said her company will be installing equipment next year so
all four offices can communicate with one another. That will make
it easier and cheaper to do video interviewing, but Howze still
prefers a personal visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I don't get a good handle on a candidate,'' she
said, adding that there is a little delay between words and
movement on the screen, which makes the experience disconcerting.
``You can tell a lot about somebody from a handshake.''
</P>
<P>
   While video interviewing hasn't exactly taken off, it's a good
recruiting tool for the university, Small said. Parents and
students like the fact that the university has the capability for
video interviewing.
</P>
<P>
   Carter said that having the technology lets employers interview
at El Paso who wouldn't normally come to the university to
interview. It opens up new career opportunities for students, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   So if some of the experts are right and video interviewing
really catches on later, here are a few tips from Carter to make
the best presentation:
</P>
<P>
   _ Try the system out ahead of time to get used to any delay in
sound transmission. That way, you'll be more relaxed.
</P>
<P>
   _ If the walls behind you are pale, wear something bright to
stand out.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't wear anything distracting such as wiggly earrings. And
keep yourself from waving your arms around as you talk.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't forget to smile.

BACK FROM THE GRAVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM SULLIVAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The band committed euthanasia 15 years ago, and the first wave
of black-clad goths wept and wailed. The band's first single,
released back in 1979, was ``Bela Lugosi's Dead'' and four years
later Bauhaus had followed Lugosi to the grave.
</P>
<P>
   Except ... well, you know how it is with the undead.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The former members of the London-based Bauhaus moved on. For
guitarist Daniel Ash, bassist David J, and drummer Kevin Haskins,
this initially meant Tones on Tail, later Love &AMP; Rockets; for
singer Peter Murphy, this meant a solo career. There were successes
and failures for each, Love &AMP; Rockets actually hitting the Top 5
with the song ``So Alive'' and Murphy scoring most effectively with
his ``Deep'' album.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the years, says J, reunion offers were dangled in
front of Bauhaus, but the band members resisted. ``We hadn't felt
the artistic compulsion to get on and do it,'' he says. ``It never
seemed thrilling, and we had other commitments.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, they finally opened the tomb, dusted themselves off,
and climbed out. A best-of CD, ``Crackle,'' was being released.
They reunited for an unannounced club gig in Los Angeles at the
Hollywood Athletic Club. They announced two more reunion dates and
both sold out in 15 minutes. A third date was added and sold out
that same day. More than 11,000 tickets gone in a flash. The guys
went ``Hmmmm ...''
</P>
<P>
   Now it's a tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're playing shows we never imagined we could,'' says Murphy.
``It's not like a revue, it's a resurrection. It's a band that
feels like we split a couple of weeks ago, in terms of musicality
and how it feels. It's really theater, this show. We're refining
it. I think sometimes it gets out of control, but that's OK. That's
part of what's unexpected about the Bauhaus experience. Pure
theater is really about being in the moment. Rehearsal and the
shape of the script is one thing, but the actual acting is the
art.''
</P>
<P>
   Bauhaus emerged as English punk rock was going down in flames
for the first time. The post-punk movement Bauhaus was part of
offered something more brooding and despairing. Murphy was, and
remains, the high-cheekboned, Bowie-esque singer, the frontman who
makes the gestures. The others are relatively inert. Bauhaus's key
songs include ``She's in Parties,'' ``Kick in the Eye,'' ``Silent
Hedges,'' and ``Burning From the Inside.'' The music has an aura of
dark celebration about it. There's a certain, if submerged pop
sensibility, and a steely electronic-cum-industrial feeling. Angst
and melodrama factor in substantially. It has roots in
glam/art-rock, as seen in band covers of Bowie's ``Ziggy
Stardust,'' T.Rex's ``Telegram Sam,'' and Brian Eno's ``Third
Uncle.''
</P>
<P>
   Why is the time right now to reform?
</P>
<P>
   ``The way we collectively feel,'' says J, ``is that the cultural
climate is just right. It's primed for it. Stylistically, there is
an atmosphere that runs through music, through fashion, through
films, that is very influenced by a kind of awareness (of Bauhaus).
It's a kind of dark romanticism that's also, in our case, a
connection with German expressionism, art and film. That was really
a big influence on Bauhaus as a group. We just felt very
enthusiastic about the prospect of getting together. It was
suddenly exciting, intoxicating, the idea of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Resurrection tour only plays six cities. Is it fun?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, Dan is calling it a lot of fun,'' says Murphy, of Ash.
``That seems to be his description.'' Fun is a somewhat ironic word
in Bauhaus's dark world.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, it's always a very weighty thing to go on tour,''
Murphy continues. ``Not only physically but in terms of putting on
a show. That's the way I am. There's a lot of heart and warmth and
giving in it, but it's also very very serious in a way, too. It's
actually very Bauhaus, you know.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bauhaus is always highly volatile,'' says J, who has made his
home in Pepperill, Mass. for the last three years. (He is soon
moving to LA.) ``It had a highly combustible chemistry. And that
was necessary to make it spark, make it happen. But it was also
part of why it actually came apart. We were still on good terms,
but in 1983, the idea of us continuing to work together was
impossible because it had become so fracturous.''
</P>
<P>
   Ego clash?
</P>
<P>
   ``The ego was not absent,'' says J.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't, personally, a bitter split,'' maintains Murphy.
``It was a split based on having burnt ourselves out. We were very
young in the sense that we didn't know how to deal with the power
we were conjuring up. And, also, there were a lot of creative ideas
in the band that weren't being expressed at the individual level.''
</P>
<P>
   (Ash, back in 1984, on tour in Boston with Tones on Tail, said,
``We got fed up with each other ... we're not the best of
friends.'')
</P>
<P>
   The band released four studio albums during its first life. As
it was dissolving, the band's manager inquired if any of the
parties wished to continue under the Bauhaus name. Both camps found
that idea abhorrent, says Murphy. They would risk new bands and new
sounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all extremely strong individuals with strong ideas,'' he
says, ``and our chemistry was about the pushing and pulling of
those ideas. It's not democratic in that sense. I mean I'm very
much a leader and I know what doesn't work. I have a strong sense
of aesthetics and theater.''
</P>
<P>
   Nostalgia is anathema to any self-respecting modern rocker _
artist or fan. Murphy is no exception. ``It's not a desperate
return to the past,'' he maintains. ``It isn't nostalgic in that
we're only living in the moment. It's very vital now. For many of
those in the audience, they've attached themselves to Bauhaus in
such a powerful way, in successive generations, and that's been
another phenomenon about us.''
</P>
<P>
   Love &AMP; Rockets releases a moody, brilliant album ``Lift'' next
month, a striking comeback from their turgid last effort ``Sweet
F.A.'' Murphy is in the midst of recording and will release a solo
album early next year. Is there a future for Bauhaus in all this?
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I'm feeling now, I just really want a long sleep,''
says Murphy, with a laugh. ``I couldn't imagine doing an album. But
I'm not really sure. I mean, when Bauhaus is on _ and this is one
of the things I'm certain about _ Bauhaus is a very unique band ...
and I think we've got albums in us.''
</P>
<P>
   As to the playing, says J, the dynamics of old are still there,
but ``we're playing the songs so much better, 'cause we've had 15
years of playing solidly. Our heads are a lot more clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking forward to this open-air event,'' says J of the
Harborlights show. ``Bauhaus is not, obviously, an outdoorsy kind
of group. I was hoping it was going to be a full moon, but the it's
the night before the full moon so I think we're going to make it
into something of a pagan rite.''
</P>
<P>
   Murphy resents it when Bauhaus is portrayed in a cliched goth
manner, but he can still relate to the old ethic. ``The goths are
beautiful,'' he says, ``a vast depth of subcultural, aesthetic, and
poetic ideas, and we would identify with that as we did back in
1979. But not the post-modern distortion ... the costume without
the brain.''
</P>
<P>
   For the goths, young and old, says J, the reunion tour ``is an
opportunity for them to hold their hand over the source of the fire
and feel the heat.''

CONSIDER SHIFTING FROM AUTOMATIC TO MANUAL IN UPDATING PROGRAMS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: What can you tell me about the various software packages
designed to ``automatically'' update the software and drivers on a
PC? Two that I am familiar with are Cybermedia's Oil Change and
IMSI's UpdateNow. How automatic is automatic? Do you have to
manually download and run a lot of executable files, or does the
software do it all for you? Are driver updates so common that you
would be updating almost daily?
</P>
<P>
   A: Both of the programs you mention work by first scanning your
computer to see what's on it. They check both for the applications
you have _ everything from word processors to Web browsers to games
_ and drivers.
</P>
<P>
   After that's done, the programs contact a server on the
Internet. The server has a list of applications, drivers and
current updates. The programs then check this against what was
found on your computer.
</P>
<P>
   If there are any updates available to you, you'll be alerted and
given the chance to download the ones you need. Once they are moved
to your computer, one of two things happen: You can let the
retrieval program install the update for you or you may have to do
it yourself. Whether it's automatic depends on whether the
publisher of the update has made it that way.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a lot of different programs on your computer, you
probably could find a new update to snag almost every day. Software
constantly is being improved, updated and patched, and grabbing
updates over the Internet makes distribution of these fixes easy
for both users and developers. But only some of them could be
considered crucial updates.
</P>
<P>
   More and more programs have this update capability built into
them. For example, all of Quarterdeck's titles come with UpdateIt,
which automates the downloading and patching of that company's
programs. Symantec's similar technology is called LiveUpdate.
Windows 98 also has an update feature.
</P>
<P>
   The services you mention charge an annual fee for access to the
update database. Frankly, unless you don't want to mess with
downloading and installing software at all, it's cheaper and even
more effective to do it yourself. That's because these servers
don't have all programs on them. And you may be offered software as
an ``update'' that's actually a demo for a program a publisher
wants you to buy.
</P>
<P>
   Think self-service. Just bookmark the Web sites of the makers of
the software and hardware on your computer and visit their support
areas regularly _ say, once a month.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How do you clear the commands from Run in the Start Menu of
Windows 95? When I click the arrow at the Run command on the Start
Menu I have a list of 24 commands. Most of them are ones I have
previously typed in. Many were typed wrong and did not work, so
there is no use having them in there. I have looked in a number of
those 2-inch-thick books on Win95 that ``tell all'' but have found
nothing about this problem. Also, I have not found any tech help
people or experts in Houston that know how to do this.
</P>
<P>
   A: The best way to do this is to use the TweakUI, one of the
PowerToys for Windows 95.
</P>
<P>
   Get TweakUI at www.microsoft.com/windows/downloads/. Install it,
and then go to the Control Panel, where you'll find the icon for
TweakUI. Doubleclick it, then look for the tab marked Paranoid.
From there you'll be able to clear the Run command, as well as
several other places where past commands are stored, including the
Documents list and the Internet Explorer history list.

CAVE DWELLING MAINLY ON LOVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM SULLIVAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Six years ago, Nick Cave was discussing his musical obsessions _
his passion for morbid, romantic blues-rock, his themes of love,
betrayal, and bloodshed. His rather visceral summary: ``I think
there is a certain perversity in my music in that I continue, you
know, to eat at the same ball of vomit year after year.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Cave was asked if that still fits. ``I think that
really applies,'' the lanky Australian-born singer-songwriter says,
from his London home. ``I find new ways of addressing things,
becoming more clear about what I've been doing all these years.
Personally, I think I've been on the same kind of artistic endeavor
I've always been on and that is to write really great love songs.
And that is the ball of vomit I'm talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   Cave and his band, the Bad Seeds, make their first Boston area
appearance since their misguided Lollapalooza daytime slot in 1994,
at the Roxy on Labor Day. Reprise has just released a best-of
album, so, one presumes, Cave wants to reintroduce himself. ``I
don't have a great desire to let anyone know I'm still here,'' Cave
says. ``I just think that it has been a long time since we've been
to America. My relationship with it has been somewhat strained over
the years. I'm not quite sure why, but a certain amount had to do
with Lollapalooza, which I found quite distractive to the group in
a lot of ways. It's been so long, America almost seems like a new
place to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Cave came to note in the early 1980s with the Birthday Party.
He, like Bauhaus was adopted by the goths, for whom Cave professes
affection. ``They are the most enduring and brave of the
(subcultures),'' he says. ``There's something sweet about that.
When the big bomb goes off, all that's going to survive are goths
and cockroaches.''
</P>
<P>
   Cave has fronted versions of the Bad Seeds since 1983, spinning
bluesy murder ballads and spiritual love songs, taking people down
deep into a pit of despair and then lifting them out. ``Well,''
poses Cave, with a slight laugh, ``at least getting them down
there. Leaving them there, I don't know. I think America seems to
have this arm-wrestle between what is dark and what is not. And
I've never seen music in those terms. I think that I'm dealing with
issues, mostly, of love. And, to me there's nothing more positive
than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Fair enough, but is that the man who wrotethe gently persuasive
``People Ain't No Good'' and many of Cave's characters meet
uncomfortable or grisly fates. ``I do have a love of violent
literature,'' he says, ``and I do get a kick out of writing violent
lyrics as well. I guess when those two things get together, love
and violence, it makes for some nasty songwriting. But I never see
that as being gloomy or depressing. I see it as quite lively.''
</P>
<P>
   He has a point. ``The Mercy Seat,'' sung from the point of view
of a condemned man about to be electrocuted, is enthralling: an
upward, dramatic spiral. Few of Cave's songs have a black-and-white
read. ``It's the world we live in,'' Cave says, of what he writes.
``I think that songs that bang on about what a happy lot this human
race is and everything is full of joy, that's an alternate world. I
don't mean to be depressing about these things, but I find songs
like that quite strange.''
</P>
<P>

<P>
   Knick-Knack: There's been a controversial Fieger in the news
over the past decade and it hasn't been singer-guitarist Doug. It's
been his older brother, Geoffrey, a lawyer for Dr. Jack Kevorkian,
who's running as a Democrat for governor in Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's my brother and I wish him well,'' says the rockin'
younger Fieger, 46. Any jealousy? ``Not from my perspective. My
father was a high-profile labor lawyer, my mother a teacher's union
organizer, my sister a successful sitcom writer.''
</P>
<P>
   Young Doug broke the bank in 1979 when his skinny-tied band, the
Knack, emerged from LA and conquered America with ``My Sharona''
and their six-million selling debut album, ``Get the Knack.'' The
idea back then was for a pop ``art project'': Guys in their 20s
writing mid-'60s-styled Britpop songs from a hormonally crazed teen
perspective. The Knack scored but they took their knocks, most
prominently from Hugh Brown who launched a Nuke the Knack campaign.
(Irony dept.: Brown is now the art director for Rhino, the Knack's
label, and gets credit on their new disc, ``Zoom.'') Critics
blasted the Knack for sexism, for corrupting the gritty purity of
punk. Fieger sees it like this: ``Success. That's it. We were
fairly well received in California before we had the success; when
we got successful with the same sound, look, and image suddenly it
wasn't cool anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fans' hearts are always pure,'' Fieger maintains. ``They
don't look at a band and examine a song beyond whether they enjoy
it. Rock 'n' roll can have elements of intelligence, though, as our
band does, but it's really about having fun ... The Knack, has
three original players _ Fieger, guitarist Berton Averre, bassist
Prescott Niles _ and new drummer Terry Bozzio (ex-Zappa, Missing
Persons), an ``explosive Keith Moon/Mitch Mitchell type who can
solo as well as lay down the law.'' The Knack still make ``records
the old-school way, but we've grown as musicians and people and our
songs have progressed. It's been a nice evolution in the respect of
the `art project.' We're taking it through adolescence and into
adulthood. Now, we're reporting on our concerns today.''
</P>
<P>
   And Sharona _ Fieger's young love and former muse _ where is she
today? She's a real estate agent selling million-dollar homes in
LA. ``She's a good friend,'' says Fieger. ``I see her sometimes and
talk to her fairly often. Our relationship was a powerful thing and
burned real hot. It ended, and we stayed friends.'' Did she grow to
hate the lustful old song? ``She loves it, even now,'' he says.

LOW-COST, COOL iMAC A HIT WITH FEW FLAWS 
 
By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Let's get two obvious things out of the way first.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Apple Computer's iMac is the coolest-looking computer
around. Apple has done a wonderful job of designing something
that's both very functional and aesthetically pleasing. It's also
given the company a great marketing opportunity, which has given
birth to a wonderful slogan: ``Sorry, no beige.''
</P>
<P>
   And no, the iMac does not have a floppy disk drive, and yes,
that's a big mistake. The floppy is not dead yet, and Apple's done
a disservice to buyers of the iMac by forcing them to spend extra
cash for an external, removable drive.
</P>
<P>
   The iMac is to Apple what the K-car was to Chrysler. It's the
product Apple is counting on to pull it permanently out of trouble.
It seems to be working _ iMacs are moving off the shelves at a
feverish pace. Apple's future hasn't looked this bright in years.
</P>
<P>
   It is also Apple's play for the low-cost, consumer market. At
$1,299, it's not as cheap as some Windows-based PCs, but it has the
benefit of being better designed and easier for novices to use.
</P>
<P>
   While Apple offers ``no beige'' for the iMac, it doesn't offer
any other colors, either. Its translucent, teal-and-white case is
all that's available. It looks nice in most decors, so long as the
carpet isn't fire-engine red and the walls aren't painted plum.
</P>
<P>
   The iMac is incredibly easy to set up, partly because the
monitor is built into the case. Plug the power cord (it's
translucent, too) in the back. Open a small door on the right side
to connect the keyboard, phone cord and any network cables if you
have them. Plug the mouse into a port on the side of the keyboard.
Push the power button on the keyboard, and that's it _ the iMac is
ready to rock.
</P>
<P>
   On initial power-up, the iMac walks you through a series of
set-up questions, determining if you are on a network and whether
you want to set up Internet access. While the Net access assistant
isn't quite as friendly as the Internet wizard found on Windows
95/98, it greatly simplifies this process for Macintosh owners.
</P>
<P>
   The operating system is basic Mac OS 8.1. Don't expect any
software surprises; what's new here is the hardware design. But the
Mac OS is better integrated with the Mac hardware than Windows is
with the Intel architecture _ you can't beat the Mac for
plug-and-play _ and the Mac's user interface is simpler. Given that
the market for this machine includes novices and home users, basic
may be better.
</P>
<P>
   With its 233-megahertz PowerPC G3 chip and 32 megabytes of
memory, it's a relatively fast computer, performing basic tasks,
such as launching programs and switching between them at speeds
comparable to Windows machines with similar specifications. If you
work with graphics-intensive programs, it will outrun most
Windows-based machines, but don't expect miracles for day-to-day
applications.
</P>
<P>
   The iMac uses two kinds of connections for hardware. There's a
built-in Ethernet port for connecting the system to a network, and
Universal Serial Bus, or USB, ports. There are no serial nor SCSI
ports, which means any devices you connect to this will have to use
USB connections, or go through an adapter. Because USB is
relatively new, there are not yet a lot of USB-based products,
though many are promised from manufacturers. Adapters are available
in the $50-$60 range.
</P>
<P>
   The iMac comes with a 56K modem _ I couldn't get it to do better
than 33.6, which apparently is a common complaint among many new
iMac owners _ and a 24-speed CD-ROM drive. Two small,
mediocre-sounding speakers are built into the front of the case.
The built-in, 15-inch monitor is an excellent display.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding the iMac's floppy-free concept: it's definitely an
idea way ahead of its time. Apple argues the floppy is dead, and
raises this question: ``When was the last time you used your floppy
disk drive?'' They say that most software today comes on CD-ROM,
and that most data files are bigger than the floppy's 1.44-megabyte
capacity.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe hyper-geeks who are comfortable burning their own CD-ROM
disks think the floppy is dead, but most home users still rely on
the format. What about children working on Macs at school who want
to bring their efforts home on floppy disk?
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, there's no removable-disk standard that's
taken the floppy's place. Consumers can choose from a variety of
formats _ 100-megabyte Iomega Zip drives, LS120 SuperDrives,
Syquest's 1- and 1.5-gigabyte SparQ drives and Sony's upcoming
high-density floppies. The Zip drive has a bigger installed base,
but it's by no means a standard.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to buy an external drive, you'll have to pay about
$90 for a USB-based floppy, which is ridiculous for a consumer
machine. If you decide to move up to a larger format, such as the
LS120, you'll pay $120 and more.
</P>
<P>
   If its designers were going to insist on leaving out the floppy,
Apple should have made an external floppy an option in the $30
price range.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the lack of a floppy drive, my only serious complaint
about the iMac has to do with its mouse. The design is, frankly, an
abomination. The mouse is flat and round, like a pancake. It's
uncomfortable to use in a long computing session. And because it's
perfectly round, you've got no tactile sense of where the ``top''
of the mouse is pointing. After a while, I find that I've lost the
mouse's orientation and must adjust it. Fortunately, because it's a
USB-based mouse, it's easy to replace. Companies like Logitech that
make mice are going to make a killing.
</P>
<P>
   (At first, I thought this was just me, so I asked some of the
artists at work who are longtime Mac users to give it a try. They
hated it, too.)
</P>
<P>
   If you are the owner of an aging Mac at home, such as one of the
older Performa models, and you've been waiting for Apple to create
a compelling new consumer offering, you need wait no longer. The
iMac is a must for you.
</P>
<P>
   If you are one of the millions of people who have yet to take
part in the personal computer revolution and have not yet learned
how to use a computer, the iMac is an excellent choice.
</P>
<P>
   If you're a novice Windows user who hates hassling with the
quirks and shortcomings of that operating system _ and if you don't
have a large investment in applications software _ the iMac is
worth considering.
</P>
<P>
   While I'm a Windows kinda guy, it feels very good to be able to
once again recommend a Macintosh to certain readers. Thanks, Apple.

FOR `FRIENDS &AMP; NEIGHBORS,' LIAISONS WITH CYNICISM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
YOUR FRIENDS &AMP; NEIGHBORS 
Directed and written by: Neil La Bute 
Starring: Amy Brenneman, Aaron Eckhardt, Catherine Keener,
Nastassja Kinski, Jason Patric, Ben Stiller 
Running time: 100 minutes 
Rated: R (graphic sexual dialogue, strong sexuality and language) 
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although his filmmaking career has barely begun, Neil LaBute is
already the undisputed master of the feel-bad movie. ``Your Friends
&AMP; Neighbors'' doesn't generate as much withering misyogny as his
jolting debut film, ``In the Company of Men.'' Artifice keeps
breaking into its roundelay of savage sexual game-playing. Still,
as the dying Mercurtio said of the sword shoved between his ribs,
'twill do. In LaBute's first film, two rage-driven corporate execs
joined forces to sexually humiliate a deaf woman office worker.
``Your Friends &AMP; Neighbors'' expands the list of players to six in
a comedy of contemporary urban sexual self-immolation.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to say what the six are making as they lurch from bed
to bed, but it isn't love, unless you regard self-regard as a
branch of it. The bleak lovelessness, and the humor that LaBute
amazingly is able to wrench from the joyless couplings, is perhaps
best expressed in an exchange between Ben Stiller's Jerry and
Catherine Keener's Terri. When Jerry insists on providing a
play-by-play description of their lovemaking, the exasperated Terri
says, ``Look, let's just do it, OK? I don't need the narration.''
Terri has a point and the excellent Keener deserves to enjoy an
overdue breakout. Each time the characters are technically
together, each is really making love to himself or herself.
</P>
<P>
   This of course is LaBute's point. Beneath the joylessness of the
unsatisfying sex we see a therapeutic intent. Couples who copulate
without intimacy aren't going to enjoy it much, and couples who
copulate in anger aren't going to enjoy it at all, except insofar
as sex represents an outlet for aggression. Certainly this is the
case with Jason Patric's narcissistic doctor, who at one point
nostalgically recalls the locker room gang rape of a boy in high
school and once wrote a woman who rejected him to tell her one of
her previous partners tested HIV-positive.
</P>
<P>
   Stiller's drama teacher and actor is at one point seen
rehearsing Wycherly's Restoration comedy, ``The Country Wife,'' a
detail that reinforces LaBute's skewering of the emptiness of
desperate promiscuity. In Restoration London, though, the
characters had colorful, if sometimes too frankly allegorical
names. Here, the names are modular _ Jerry, Terri, Cherry, Barry,
Cary and Mary _ bolstering the sense that it makes little
difference who sleeps with whom, considering how little each is
bringing to the bed.
</P>
<P>
   The alienation, in short, is what makes the sex so cutthroat.
And so blackly funny in what must stand as one of the year's
superior ensemble efforts as the bedroom scenes and locker room
scenes (reinforcing sex as a lethal contact sport in the eyes of
the men and the scarcely less dysfunctional women) succeed one
another in LaBute's emotional gulag. Stiller's actor takes on the
quality of a human drill bit, boring ever onward, never aware.
Aaron Eckhardt, the heartless barracuda of ``In the Company of
Men,'' goes the opposite route here, playing a going-soft cuckold,
upended by his impotence.
</P>
<P>
   Amy Brenneman is fascinating, too, and the most complex,
possibly because the repose on her face (a quality that attracts
Stiller's restless mess) belies the confusion she's feeling.
Keener's brittle woman betrayed by her live-in lover, the actor,
touchingly blends anger and pain as she turns to a lesbian
relationship, hoping she'll be less hurt by Natassja Kinski's art
gallery assistant. The gallery scenes, when each of the characters
in succession hits on Kinski by pretending to comment on the same
painting, falls flat. But most of LaBute's probes are on target in
this simultaneously sad and funny aerial photograph of an emotional
tundra. ``Your Friends &AMP; Neighbors'' will restore your faith in
cynicism.

<P>
   Coming-of-age films don't get any warmer, funnier, raunchier, or
more endearing than Tamara Jenkins's brightly feisty memoir,
``Slums of Beverly Hills.'' Among other things, the film is a
corrective, making up for ``Pretty Woman'' and all those other
films that reinforce the image of Beverly Hills as Rodeo Drive and
movie stars' mansions nestled in the hills above. There are slums
in Beverly Hills, jerry-built stucco-membraned boxes sitting on
wrought-iron stilts, bearing self-mocking names like Bella Capri or
Camelot.
</P>
<P>
   As a girl scampering around the fringes of the wrong side of
Beverly Hills, moving at night each time her father would suddenly
announce, ``C'mon, we're going,'' and pile the family's belongings
into the back of his Cadillac, Jenkins says she came to think of
her family as the Jewish Joads. In this semiautobiographical
evocation of the slippery slope of status-seeking, she's brought to
sweetly quirky life by Natasha Lyonne, the only level-headed member
of the family she regards as irredeemably weird. But then, it has
always been her job to put on the brakes and introduce some healthy
skepticism into the mix.
</P>
<P>
   Her social and navigational skills are brought to a screeching
halt when, to her horror, she begins to sprout breasts that appear
as alarmingly as a suddenly inflated life jacket. This means a
struggle to maintain her equilibrium in close quarters with her
father and two younger brothers, all of whom feel free to comment
upon her changing body. If Lyonne represents the future, as soon as
she can negotiate this awkward growth spurt, Alan Arkin's patriarch
stands as another of the superb characterizations he has been
crafting these past few years.
</P>
<P>
   The thing that makes Lyonne's Vivian so unforgettable is that
part of her sees that her life is as howlingly ridiculous as it's
mortifying. Jenkins wasn't interested in going back and taking
potshots at her family. The tenderness with which she embraces them
gives Arkin all he needs to make Murray, the single father in
social and financial disarray, more than a poor schlep who can't
get the American dream right. He hangs in there, Murray does,
clinging to the underside of Beverly Hills for the school system
and the status, giving his kids advantage if he can't give them
money.
</P>
<P>
   If Arkin's Murray is a study in wistful exhaustion and Lyonne's
Vivian is uneasily poised on the brink of adulthood, Marisa Tomei's
loose cannon from the well-to-do side of the family is never just a
caricature of wantonness. The film plays her instability for
poignance, never cheap laughs, even when the two women bond during
an improvised dance with a vibrator as she ushers Vivian into the
lusty side of life. Vivian has a wisdom in her eyes and a largeness
of personality that enable her to hold the screen against her
earthy, but ultimately lost cousin.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Tomei, despite the extravagance of her character, has
an uphill battle to stake out some turf for herself amid the
lovingly tolerant father-daughter duet between Lyonne and Arkin.
It's never discussed, but Vivian is pushed into the absent mother
role, holding the family together, flaky as it is, and not minding.
David Krumholtz's brother with dreams of his own, and Kevin
Corrigan, as the first suitor to whom Vivian's instincts correctly
lead her, add to the appeal. Jenkins' blend of eccentricity and
emotional expansiveness make ``Slums of Beverly Hills'' the
filmgoer's address of choice in the weeks ahead. It's got riches
you'll never see in ``90210.''

CLINTON, WARRIOR FOR GAY RIGHTS, MAY BE MORTALLY WOUNDED 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAVE FORD  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ As an American watching President Clinton
pretend to apologize to the nation for having an ``inappropriate
relationship'' with former intern Monica Lewinsky, I felt
embarrassed, sad and angry.
</P>
<P>
   But as a gay American, I felt deep despair. To the extent that
the scandal would hamper the president's legislative effectiveness,
I felt I was losing a quiet warrior for the rights of my community.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton is no policy peach; I don't agree, for instance,
with his idea of ``welfare reform.'' But he has done more for the
lesbian and gay community than any president in history. Granted,
the ``don't ask, don't tell'' gays-in-the-military debacle rankled,
as did his support of the Defense of Marriage Act, which allowed
states to deny the legality of gay marriages.
</P>
<P>
   Anomalies aside, however, Clinton's presidency is rife with
historical lesbian and gay firsts. He is the first president to
sign an executive order protecting federal workers from job
discrimination based on sexual orientation. He is the first to
invite lesbian and gay leaders to the White House for policy
discussions. He is the first to support hate-crimes legislation. He
is the first to say ``lesbian and gay'' in a speech to his party's
presidential nominating convention (in 1996). And, in another
first, he has appointed more open lesbians and gays to
administration posts than any president before him.
</P>
<P>
   In an era when symbols carry the weight of truth, Clinton's
symbolic relationship with the lesbian and gay community also
speaks volumes. He hobnobs with David Geffen, an openly gay mogul.
He is the first president to speak before a national lesbian and
gay group (the Human Rights Campaign). At that function, he was
photographed sharing a joke with actors _ and lovers _ Ellen
DeGeneres and Anne Heche, who casually draped their arms around
each others' shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt independent counsel Kenneth Starr is just doing his
job. But only an ignoramus would argue he's not allied with
conservative forces. His four-year investigation _ starting with an
Arkansas land deal, and spinning through the death of lawyer Vince
Foster and alleged White House travel office improprieties _ has
skidded to a halt, horribly, on the hope of pinning a perjury
charge on a president based on the man's sexual misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   This is the kind of politicized persecution lesbians and gays
understand. I don't mean to compare healthy homosexual behavior to
aberrant heterosexual behavior (in this case, adultery and what
some would consider on-the-job sexual harassment). Nonetheless,
lesbians and gays are accustomed to having our sexual behavior held
up to public and political scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   True, our fight for civil rights is based on our sexual
orientation _ or, more prosaically, on whom and how we love. Yet a
host of Americans consider our sexual orientation a ``sin'' (just
as they consider adultery a sin, I suppose). This putative moral
high ground allows some of them license to take the low road in
waging political war against the lesbian and gay community: Our
private behavior becomes a matter of public debate, and often is
twisted into unrecognizable forms.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., recently
likened homosexuality to kleptomania and alcoholism, and called it
``curable.'' Calculating its timing, a coalition of right-wing
groups ran ads in major U.S. newspapers exhorting lesbians and gays
to ``convert'' to heterosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   This is part of a new _ and misguided _ attempt to whip up
support for the Republican Party. And it has consequences. The
Republican-controlled House recently passed an amendment that, if
signed into law, would prevent San Francisco from using federal
housing money to implement the city's domestic partner's ordinance.
</P>
<P>
   Another recent Republican-sponsored amendment _ narrowly
defeated _ would have voided Clinton's executive order sparing
lesbian and gay federal workers from sexual orientation-based job
discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   A weakened President Clinton may embolden Republicans in their
gloves-off rhetorical and legislative assault on the lesbian and
gay community. That is a disturbing thought. Like most Americans,
I'm not thrilled with the man's private behavior, but I support his
presidency. As a gay man, I remain troubled that, through
thoughtless private conduct, he has endangered the kind of work
he's done on behalf of my community.

HAZING: INITIATION RITUALS LOSE FAVOR WHEN FUN GOES TOO FAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RALEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Seattle Mariner Alex Rodriguez stood outside Kansas City's
Kauffman Stadium, signing autographs and explaining himself. The
shortstop usually causes a stir wherever he goes, but nothing could
top this. He wore a dress.
</P>
<P>
   Then an impressionable rookie, Rodriguez was only doing what his
veteran teammates had ordered. This was hazing, Mariner-style.
</P>
<P>
   Today, former University of Washington tight end Cam Cleeland
continues to suffer headaches and blurred vision, the victim of a
violent rite of initiation inflicted upon him at the New Orleans
Saints training camp in Wisconsin. Wearing a pillow case over his
head and forced to run a gauntlet of teammates, Cleeland was socked
in the head by someone swinging a bag of rolled quarters.
</P>
<P>
   As Cleeland considers a pro career hanging in the balance and
possible legal action, the curious ritual of hazing remains
ingrained in our military, schools and athletic teams.
</P>
<P>
   In some states, laws have been passed rejecting it. Soldiers,
students and athletes abusing peers in this roguish manner
routinely have been punished or banished. Still it persists.
</P>
<P>
   Why?
</P>
<P>
   ``I considered it part of coming up in baseball, part of your
development,'' Rodriguez said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Frank Smoll, a UW sports psychologist, finds this logic
troublesome. He wonders how embarrassing, insulting or hurting
anyone could be beneficial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to think, what is the purpose of hazing, and it might be
that misery loves company and that might pull a group closer,''
Smoll said. ``But I have strong doubts that this creates elements
of cohesion. It more likely creates barriers between the hazees and
the hazers.''
</P>
<P>
   The first evidence of hazing appeared in the mid-1800s on ships.
To build discipline or simply to bully, some crewmen were subjected
to unnecessary, humiliating or often painful tasks.
</P>
<P>
   From there, hazing evolved to the military, fraternal
organizations, schools and athletic teams. The armed forces, in
particular, made this part of their culture and have come to regret
it in the more politically correct 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy has had to live down ``Tailhook,'' an annual hotel
gathering in which drunken airmen subject women to a gauntlet of
groping and other degradation. The Marines have had to answer for
``pinnings,'' an equally crude display requiring men and women to
have spiked military decorations driven into their chests by
superiors as reward for passing parachute training.
</P>
<P>
   The need to pass inspection in an unsettling manner is not
solely male-oriented. In recent years, Seattle-area high school
cheerleaders were disciplined after forcing newcomers to imitate
sex acts, wear condoms in their hair or get down on all fours and
bark like dogs, all at school.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariner veterans still insist that their rookies go through
annual hazing, usually on the final road trip in September. By
their reasoning, it's fairly tame stuff. A couple of veterans seek
out a thrift shop and buy the most outlandish outfits they can
find, then return to the clubhouse and substitute rookies' regular
clothes for the new ones.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, pitchers Jeff Fassero and Jamie Moyer did the
shopping. They picked out ballerina dresses for Andy Sheets and
Giomar Guevara.
</P>
<P>
   In previous years, the late-season Mariner rookie wardrobe has
included striped pants, plaid shirts, goofy hats and bizarre shoes.
Once dressed, players are instructed to stand outside the stadium
and sign autographs for a designated period.
</P>
<P>
   Outfielder Raul Ibanez was forced to wear a green shirt,
checkered pants and maroon sports coat. That wasn't the hard part.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to give 20 autographs and it was a little bit
embarrassing,'' he said. ``Can you imagine how difficult it is to
give 20 autographs when no one even wants your autograph? I'll
probably have to do it again this year, because I'm still
technically a rookie.''
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks have toned down their antics considerably. Rookies
now mostly carry teammates' helmets and shoulder pads from the
field and fetch soft drinks and bus food trays in the cafeteria.
The occasional school song is demanded. Rookies used to have their
clothes burned, get taped naked to goal posts or trees and find
snakes or frogs in their beds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here it's very tame; we hardly do anything,'' quarterback
Warren Moon said. ``I've been places where they cut all your hair
off or cut weird designs in your hair, and you have to keep it for
at least 24 hours before they can cut the rest of it off. ... What
happened in New Orleans is totally uncalled for.''
</P>
<P>
   Moon spent his rookie season as a pro player in the Canadian
Football League with Edmonton. He escaped the worst of the
indoctrination.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most they ever made me do was chug a beer against
somebody,'' he said. ``If you lose, you've got to keep doing it.
Fortunately, I won the first time and I was out of there.''
</P>
<P>
   It seems everyone has a hazing story to tell. Even Cleeland's
father, Gene, was not spared. As a high school football player in
Arizona, he was forced to wear makeshift underwear made out of
burlap sack. He remembers how hot he felt.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Cleeland, however, is not laughing now. His son's pro
football future is uncertain, though Cam's blurred vision has
improved.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of the injury, Gene Cleeland suggested the
incident was racist, making statements he now regrets. With his son
hurt in a foolish manner, Cleeland says he spoke without thinking.
His son admonished him for it. Admittedly, Gene Cleeland was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   But the player's father has not changed his stance on hazing.
The practice still has too much acceptance, with too little
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somewhere, sometime, someone must stand up to the bullies,''
Gene Cleeland said. ``It's important that someone does, so no
mother's son has to go through this kind of thing again.''
</P>
<P>
   P-I reporters Jim Street and Clare Farnsworth contributed to
this report.

Russian economy at present exchange rates. In other words, in one
glum week's work, Japan managed the financial equivalent of wiping
Russia off the world map. Japan is so monumental as to be central
to the health of the global economy, but for now it remains a mess,
albeit an impressively large one. A month after Prime Minister

   American scientists claim they've found the bit of the human
brain that decides whether or not a thing is worth remembering.
Though lots of brain areas hum into action when looking at a view
or a photograph, it's only the right pre-frontal lobe that decides
whether or not to log it in the memory banks.
</P>
<P>
   That at least accounts for President Clinton's selective memory
for what he gives young women. It's because of his right
pre-frontal that he's still being asked about the dress, the
brooch, the hatpin and the volume of Walt Whitman's poetry that he
allegedly gave Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   It's not prevarication or mendacity that he's guilty of here,
just that darned wayward lobe.
</P>
<P>
   But of all the gifts Clinton ``could have given'' the lovely
Monica, the most significant is that volume of poems. There's an
eerie conjunction between the shaggy-bearded seer of American
letters and the clean-cut lothario of the Oval Office that has not
been properly explored until now.
</P>
<P>
   The President's admiration for Whitman goes beyond a literary
appreciation of his immensely long, meandering rhapsodies of
Americana. Clinton also gave his wife a volume of Whitman as a
wedding present.
</P>
<P>
   It's possible he dishes out Walt's collected works to any
females he feels attracted to, as a warning of what they may expect
to encounter at his hands.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman's most famous poem is ``Song Of Myself,'' an epic burst
of crowing narcissism. It doesn't take much hindsight to see how
Clinton might identify with it.
</P>
<P>
   At one point Whitman actually asks, ``Have you outstripped the
rest? Are you the President?'' And we can imagine Bill striding the
swirly carpet of the White House, book in hand, nodding vigorously,
before going on to the section containing the words, ``Divine am I
inside and out, and I make holy whatever I touch or am touched
from.''
</P>
<P>
   Got that, girls? There's nothing grubby or degrading about
anything you may be asked to do, since the presidential droit de
seigneur enables it.
</P>
<P>
   Those who've read Christopher Hitchens' revelations about what
Clinton and Monica got up to in private _ the ``unconsummated oral
sex'' she performed on his clothed and vertical frame, followed by
Lewinsky's stepping back, removing her kit and doing a little dance
to encourage her inamorata to pleasure himself _ may marvel at the
one-sided nature of the business.
</P>
<P>
   And now that she's told the grand jury how he fondled her both
upstairs and down (as I'm afraid we used to say in our teens), you
may wonder why he didn't go the whole hog.
</P>
<P>
   The answer, it seems, is also in Whitman's poem. ``I merely
stir, press, feel with my fingers, and am happy,'' he writes. ``To
touch my person to someone else's is about as much as I can
stand.''
</P>
<P>
   It all becomes startlingly relevant, as Whitman/Clinton
describes someone performing nameless indignities on him: ``On all
sides prurient provokers stiffening my limbs / straining the udder
of my heart for its withheld drip / behaving licentious toward me,
taking no denial... Unbuttoning my clothes, holding me by the bare
waist...''
</P>
<P>
   Blimey! There's even a moment when, pre-climatically, he cries,
``Enough! Enough! Enough!... Stand back!'' _ as Clinton undoubtedly
directed his raven-haired intern.
</P>
<P>
   If ever there was a poem that doubled as an instruction manual
in the erotic proclivities of the First Philanderer, it's this one.
</P>
<P>
   How poignant that it even prefigures his own remorseful
confession _ that ever after he was so comprehensively shafted by
Linda Tripp, Kenneth Starr and Lewinsky herself, he had to admit it
was his own fault.
</P>
<P>
   How do those other lines of Whitman go? ``I am given up by
traitors, I talk wildly, I have lost my wits, I and nobody else am
the greatest traitor.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   MAINZ, Germany _ After nearly a millennium of relative
obscurity, a medieval German nun has been born again into a state
of celebrity sainthood.
</P>
<P>
   Entire industries have grown out of the renaissance in the
popularity of St. Hildegard von Bingen, a Benedictine abbess,
writer, composer and holistic healer who seems to turn up
practically everywhere this year, from Cologne to New York, exactly
900 years after she was born.
</P>
<P>
   In concert with a full year of international birthday
commemorations, some of St. Hildegard's two dozen pieces of choral
music, now on compact discs, top some music charts.
</P>
<P>
   A brisk Rhineland tourist trade thrives in her honor, with one
glossy brochure urging pilgrims to ``tour Hildegard's historical
sites by motorcycle.''
</P>
<P>
   A chic publishing boom has filled some European bookstores with
reissues of her imagistic poetry and mystical philosophy along with
shelves of cookbooks and calendars and an estimated 1,000 other new
titles that range from theological scholarship to mass-market
paperbacks like ``Hildegard in a Nutshell.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's followers of St. Hildegard cannot seem to get enough of
the ``prophetissa teutonica,'' as one early admirer called her in
1206.
</P>
<P>
   In what some call Hildegard health care, mainstream pharmacies
in German-speaking Europe carry several brands of herbal remedies
under her name that are meant to treat everything from heart
disease to migraines.
</P>
<P>
   One firm alone, Jura KG, claims to distribute its products in
10,000 outlets.
</P>
<P>
   Fans munch St. Hildegard's whole-meal cakes, cookies and
dumplings made from the grainy dinkel flour that she recommended.
New Age adherents give symposiums on her advice for using crystals.
Southern Germany boasts a Hildegard health spa.
</P>
<P>
   In a German election year, politicians have joined bishops in
holding speeches in St. Hildegard's honor. Ministers in Bonn have
issued a Hildegard postage stamp (often sold out) and commemorative
coins.
</P>
<P>
   As a female founder of monasteries and a rebel in a
male-dominated church, she is also venerated by some women for her
distinctly feminist theology.
</P>
<P>
   Devotees of Bacchus also admire St. Hildegard, who wrote in one
of her medical texts, Causae et Curae _ or Causes and Cures _ that
``a wine that is pure cleanses the blood of its drinker.''
</P>
<P>
   In this Hildegard year, that advice has spawned Hildegard
wine-tasting seminars. At least three different brands of Rhine
wine are sold under her name.
</P>
<P>
   She even rocks. Angel Records in New York, a division of EMI
Records, produced an electronically synthesized version of her
canticles, or liturgical songs.
</P>
<P>
   After selling more than 300,000 and topping the Billboard list
for ``crossover'' productions _ a ranking of popularized classical
music _ Angel last year released a sequel called Vision II.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is Hildegard doing at the disco?'' asked one German
magazine incredulously.
</P>
<P>
   Like other celebrities, she is frequently in the newspapers.
Culture commentators and religion writers have been scratching
their heads in wonder at the popular abbess.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is being revered, commercialized and exploited as never
before,'' according to the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung.
</P>
<P>
   St. Hildegard was born in 1098, but because her exact date of
birth was not recorded, the entire year has been opened to a
windfall of commemorations. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 170 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ahead of her feast day on Sept. 17, pilgrims arrive daily _
sometimes 20 busloads a day _ to visit St. Hildegard's Abbey in
Eibingen on the Rhine, one of two 12th century monasteries she
founded, said Sister Philippa, a nun at Eibingen. Many visitors
come from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The Pope will send an ambassador to the annual Eibingen
procession and mass on her feast day. Despite St. Hildegard's
powers of prophecy, which Pope Eugenius III confirmed as authentic
in 1148, it is unlikely she expected this sort of afterlife.
</P>
<P>
   ``When she was alive, she was not a pop icon by any means,''
said Benjamin Bagby, a co-founder of Sequentia, a Cologne-based
choral group that specializes in early music and has been credited
with St. Hildegard's revival.
</P>
<P>
   To rescue her from becoming a Benedictine Elvis _ as one
newspaper commented _ serious scholars and musicians like Bagby
have countered with hundreds of symposiums, lectures, concerts and
exhaustively researched museum exhibits. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, the giddy sense of celebration is
apparently shared.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just about every Catholic college in the country is doing
something to honor her,'' said a Northwestern University professor,
Barbara Newman, who has translated St. Hildegard's poetry and ranks
as one of the leading U.S. experts on St. Hildegard.
</P>
<P>
   New York's Lincoln Center has just performed her works to
sold-out audiences. Grace Cathedral in San Francisco is leading a
pilgrimage to Germany in time for her feast day, Sept. 17. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 120 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Scholars come up with several reasons why the life and works of
a cloistered nun can loom so large across nine centuries. Perhaps
the most conspicuous stems from St. Hildegard's decision to situate
her convents in what is now some of the most heavily touristed
byways in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The Eibingen monastery sits in the vineyards a few hundred
meters above the postcard town of Ruedesheim, trampled by 2.5
million tourists a year and often described as kitchy.
</P>
<P>
   Most come to drink and buy Rhine wine. It was only natural that
the local chamber of commerce created a ``1098-1998 Jubilee Year''
logo to promote a profusion of ``Experiencing Hildegard'' tour
packages. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Publishing houses also have driven her media resurrection. St.
Hildegard resonates powerfully in an era when publishing trade
groups report an unslackening demand for books and music with a
spiritual or religious theme.
</P>
<P>
   Riding the wave of New Age enthusiasm, many Hildegard fans take
from her what they want and do not bother to understand her in all
her complexity, said Gabriele Lautenschlaeger, a member of the
theological faculty at Wuerzburg University. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``She fits the slogan, `Jesus yes, church no,''' she said. &QL; 
St. Hildegard's life story also seems to fit Hollywood's dream
machine. At least two movie scripts are in the works about her,
said Paul Cremo, director of film and television projects in New
York at Sony Classical Records. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the monks in her first monastery, which she entered as
a hermit at the age of 8, her monastic life has been
well-documented. Revelations in the form of ``burning'' visions
overpowered the frail and often sick girl. She called herself a
``visio'' or mystical seer.
</P>
<P>
   Over time, the charismatic abbess came to resent the domination
of monks and was ready to found her own monastery, taking 20
sisters with her. The monks fought her, partly because her status
anchored their fund-raising income.
</P>
<P>
   The secession was the first of several feuds with a
male-dominated church hierarchy that she won.
</P>
<P>
   Today many of her fans discover her first through her music,
which variously has been described as ethereal, mesmerizing,
austere, complex and exotic.
</P>
<P>
   Interest in her hymns had been dormant for about 800 years but
has proliferated over the past decade onto some two dozen compact
discs.
</P>
<P>
   Internet sites like www.Hildegard.com exist solely to sell her
music, which includes 77 canticles and a passion play that ranks as
Germany's first opera.
</P>
<P>
   Bagby at Sequentia said that publishers have a wide range of
interest in producing her music. ``Some just want to make money,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The music industry,'' Bagby said, ``saw they could make a lot
of money selling something very simple and very spiritual. People
who wanted to simplify their lives, like stressed-out business
people, buy it.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, as Professor Newman put it, ``Even a watered-down Hildegard
has more to offer than much of our current pop culture.'' &QL;

   RUSSIA-CRISIS _ MOSCOW _ President Boris Yeltsin is scheduled to
make a televised address Friday night after making a rare public
appearance at the Kremlin as his aide continued to deny any plans
for him to step aside in the face of Russia's grave economic
crisis. But underscoring his growing insignificance to the critical
events unfolding in Russia, the real action was taking place in
negotiations between acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and
opposition parliament leaders. They held talks on a plan that could
bring the Communist Party into a new government, a role in
governing that the party has not had since the Soviet Union
collapsed in 1991. (Holmes, Cox News Service).

political structure in jeopardy, this business elite appears more
and more to be pulling the strings of a man many thought was on the
level of a tsar. But who are they? (Holmes, Cox News Service).

Amsterdam,'' said Howard Hamilton. Tourism provides jobs for more
than 40 percent of the island's population. But tourists aren't
flocking to Jamaica like they once did because of harassment, the
worst in the Caribbean. In the midst of an economic depression,
tourists find themselves bombarded by desperate panhandlers,
prostitutes, drug dealers and craft vendors, so much so that
Holland America and Celebrity Cruise Lines pulled out of Jamaica
last year. Jamaica has increased fines for those who badger
tourists, from $27 to $2,700. But still the harassment continues.
Hamilton said that if the country legalized brothels, at least the
prostitutes would stay off the streets -- he hopes. (Emling, Cox

   BELARUS-PUPPET _ MINSK, Belarus _ The Soviet Union has collapsed
and the Moscow nights swing nowadays, but back here in Minsk old
communist-style think still remains the norm. Take the case of
``Pinocchio.'' The Belarussian version of the traditional puppet
show for children was yanked off the Minsk stage not long ago when
critics saw too many allusions to the current nasty political scene
in the play. How could a mere children's show cause so much offense
in this dictator-run land? That's easy. To begin with, Ales Surau,
the set designer, dressed the wooden ``actors'' in contemporary
quilted jackets, Russian workers' caps, and workers' rubber boots.
That act alone aroused the ire of the official critics. ``The
peasants look like criminals. I was at a collective farm not long
ago and I saw people there who were very well dressed,'' one them
complained. (Golinski, Cox News Service).

   MEXICO-DEAFMUTE _ MEXICO CITY _ He sold trinkets in the New York
subway, Chicago and the suburban American South. But by the time he
was discovered by U.S. authorities, life had changed for Braulio
David Infante. He knew that deaf people in the United States had
high schools, colleges and could develop professions. He was smart
and ambitious why couldn't he? Infante, who just turned 20, was
among the many undocumented Mexican deaf mutes discovered in the
United States last year, some held in virtual captivity and forced
to turn over trinket profits to ring leaders. Infante was sent back
from Atlanta to Mexico, where authorities promised to help him and
others with new opportunities to overcome barriers in Mexico.
Almost a year later, he says, nothing has changed. The Mexican
government recently made similar promises to deaf mutes who
returned from New York in July. But Infante says social workers
here have treated him as if he were mentally retarded. Clever and
resourceful, he longs to break out of the silence that isolates
him. He wants to attend college and become a Mexican-American Sign
Language interpreter. But in Mexico there isn't even a high school
for him to attend. Infante remains in contact with his Atlanta
lawyer, and dreams of one day attending school in the United
States. (Ferriss, Cox News Service).

<P>
   MAINZ, Germany _ After nearly a millennium of relative
obscurity, a medieval German nun has been born again into a state
of celebrity sainthood.
</P>
<P>
   Entire industries have grown out of the renaissance in the
popularity of St. Hildegard von Bingen, a Benedictine abbess,
writer, composer and holistic healer who seems to turn up
practically everywhere this year, from Cologne to New York, exactly
900 years after she was born.
</P>
<P>
   In concert with a full year of international birthday
commemorations, some of St. Hildegard's two dozen pieces of choral
music, now on compact discs, top some music charts.
</P>
<P>
   A brisk Rhineland tourist trade thrives in her honor, with one
glossy brochure urging pilgrims to ``tour Hildegard's historical
sites by motorcycle.''
</P>
<P>
   A chic publishing boom has filled some European bookstores with
reissues of her imagistic poetry and mystical philosophy along with
shelves of cookbooks and calendars and an estimated 1,000 other new
titles that range from theological scholarship to mass-market
paperbacks like ``Hildegard in a Nutshell.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's followers of St. Hildegard cannot seem to get enough of
the ``prophetissa teutonica,'' as one early admirer called her in
1206.
</P>
<P>
   In what some call Hildegard health care, mainstream pharmacies
in German-speaking Europe carry several brands of herbal remedies
under her name that are meant to treat everything from heart
disease to migraines.
</P>
<P>
   One firm alone, Jura KG, claims to distribute its products in
10,000 outlets.
</P>
<P>
   Fans munch St. Hildegard's whole-meal cakes, cookies and
dumplings made from the grainy dinkel flour that she recommended.
New Age adherents give symposiums on her advice for using crystals.
Southern Germany boasts a Hildegard health spa.
</P>
<P>
   In a German election year, politicians have joined bishops in
holding speeches in St. Hildegard's honor. Ministers in Bonn have
issued a Hildegard postage stamp (often sold out) and commemorative
coins.
</P>
<P>
   As a female founder of monasteries and a rebel in a
male-dominated church, she is also venerated by some women for her
distinctly feminist theology.
</P>
<P>
   Devotees of Bacchus also admire St. Hildegard, who wrote in one
of her medical texts, Causae et Curae _ or Causes and Cures _ that
``a wine that is pure cleanses the blood of its drinker.''
</P>
<P>
   In this Hildegard year, that advice has spawned Hildegard
wine-tasting seminars. At least three different brands of Rhine
wine are sold under her name.
</P>
<P>
   She even rocks. Angel Records in New York, a division of EMI
Records, produced an electronically synthesized version of her
canticles, or liturgical songs.
</P>
<P>
   After selling more than 300,000 and topping the Billboard list
for ``crossover'' productions _ a ranking of popularized classical
music _ Angel last year released a sequel called Vision II.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is Hildegard doing at the disco?'' asked one German
magazine incredulously.
</P>
<P>
   Like other celebrities, she is frequently in the newspapers.
Culture commentators and religion writers have been scratching
their heads in wonder at the popular abbess.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is being revered, commercialized and exploited as never
before,'' according to the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung.
</P>
<P>
   St. Hildegard was born in 1098, but because her exact date of
birth was not recorded, the entire year has been opened to a
windfall of commemorations. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Ahead of her feast day on Sept. 17, pilgrims arrive daily _
sometimes 20 busloads a day _ to visit St. Hildegard's Abbey in
Eibingen on the Rhine, one of two 12th century monasteries she
founded, said Sister Philippa, a nun at Eibingen. Many visitors
come from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The Pope will send an ambassador to the annual Eibingen
procession and mass on her feast day. Despite St. Hildegard's
powers of prophecy, which Pope Eugenius III confirmed as authentic
in 1148, it is unlikely she expected this sort of afterlife.
</P>
<P>
   ``When she was alive, she was not a pop icon by any means,''
said Benjamin Bagby, a co-founder of Sequentia, a Cologne-based
choral group that specializes in early music and has been credited
with St. Hildegard's revival.
</P>
<P>
   To rescue her from becoming a Benedictine Elvis _ as one
newspaper commented _ serious scholars and musicians like Bagby
have countered with hundreds of symposiums, lectures, concerts and
exhaustively researched museum exhibits. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   In the United States, the giddy sense of celebration is
apparently shared.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just about every Catholic college in the country is doing
something to honor her,'' said a Northwestern University professor,
Barbara Newman, who has translated St. Hildegard's poetry and ranks
as one of the leading U.S. experts on St. Hildegard.
</P>
<P>
   New York's Lincoln Center has just performed her works to
sold-out audiences. Grace Cathedral in San Francisco is leading a
pilgrimage to Germany in time for her feast day, Sept. 17. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 120 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Scholars come up with several reasons why the life and works of
a cloistered nun can loom so large across nine centuries. Perhaps
the most conspicuous stems from St. Hildegard's decision to situate
her convents in what is now some of the most heavily touristed
byways in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The Eibingen monastery sits in the vineyards a few hundred
meters above the postcard town of Ruedesheim, trampled by 2.5
million tourists a year and often described as kitchy.
</P>
<P>
   Most come to drink and buy Rhine wine. It was only natural that
the local chamber of commerce created a ``1098-1998 Jubilee Year''
logo to promote a profusion of ``Experiencing Hildegard'' tour
packages. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Publishing houses also have driven her media resurrection. St.
Hildegard resonates powerfully in an era when publishing trade
groups report an unslackening demand for books and music with a
spiritual or religious theme.
</P>
<P>
   Riding the wave of New Age enthusiasm, many Hildegard fans take
from her what they want and do not bother to understand her in all
her complexity, said Gabriele Lautenschlaeger, a member of the
theological faculty at Wuerzburg University. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``She fits the slogan, `Jesus yes, church no,''' she said. &QL; 
St. Hildegard's life story also seems to fit Hollywood's dream
machine. At least two movie scripts are in the works about her,
said Paul Cremo, director of film and television projects in New
York at Sony Classical Records. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the monks in her first monastery, which she entered as
a hermit at the age of 8, her monastic life has been
well-documented. Revelations in the form of ``burning'' visions
overpowered the frail and often sick girl. She called herself a
``visio'' or mystical seer.
</P>
<P>
   Over time, the charismatic abbess came to resent the domination
of monks and was ready to found her own monastery, taking 20
sisters with her. The monks fought her, partly because her status
anchored their fund-raising income.
</P>
<P>
   The secession was the first of several feuds with a
male-dominated church hierarchy that she won.
</P>
<P>
   Today many of her fans discover her first through her music,
which variously has been described as ethereal, mesmerizing,
austere, complex and exotic.
</P>
<P>
   Interest in her hymns had been dormant for about 800 years but
has proliferated over the past decade onto some two dozen compact
discs.
</P>
<P>
   Internet sites like www.Hildegard.com exist solely to sell her
music, which includes 77 canticles and a passion play that ranks as
Germany's first opera.
</P>
<P>
   Bagby at Sequentia said that publishers have a wide range of
interest in producing her music. ``Some just want to make money,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The music industry,'' Bagby said, ``saw they could make a lot
of money selling something very simple and very spiritual. People
who wanted to simplify their lives, like stressed-out business
people, buy it.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, as Professor Newman put it, ``Even a watered-down Hildegard
has more to offer than much of our current pop culture.'' &QL;

<P>
   TAULIGNAN, France _ Yet another huge IMF-sponsored rescue
package has promptly fizzled out. Billions of dollars have been
spent to no avail. Disasters of this magnitude occur far too often
these days.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the Russian meltdown is a tale of bad economic and
political judgment, in the West and in the East.
</P>
<P>
   There was nothing deeply wrong with the ruble. True, the fall in
oil prices has hurt Russia badly, and a moderate depreciation could
have helped. But the problem is elsewhere, and everybody knows it:
The federal government is increasingly unable to collect taxes,
which have fallen from 20 percent of GDP in 1992 to 8 percent this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Russian authorities have managed to contain the budget deficit,
but they have done it the wrong way, by not paying what they owe.
</P>
<P>
   In today's Russia nobody feels that dues must be paid, not the
government and not the taxpayers. Why pay if there is no sanction?
</P>
<P>
   From headquarters just as lavish as those in New York or London,
Russian banks and corporations engage in big commercial deals, make
their top executives immensely rich, they claim that they cough up
a few kopecks and carry on.
</P>
<P>
   If tax collection goes on declining, there is no way the
government can service its debt. This is what triggered the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Domestic and foreign investors alike scrambled to the exit door.
Pundits certified that the ruble was not overvalued, but there were
no takers. Self-interested financiers convinced the authorities to
buy those rubles, and when the stock of dollars dried out in July,
the IMF provided a new pile which just went down the same tube.
</P>
<P>
   On paper, the IMF conditions for the loan could have solved the
problem. But half of the required measures had to be approved by
the Communist-controlled Duma, which has never passed any
legislation without crippling it.
</P>
<P>
   To meet the other half, the government would have had to get
tough with bad taxpayers, but these are all the president's
friends, and the prime minister (now replaced) was patently weak.
The IMF conditions never had a fighting chance. That was mistake
No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Mistake No. 2 was not to request that the embattled ruble be
allowed to float. Same mistake as in Mexico, as in Asia, and soon
in Brazil and Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF's main shareholder, the United States, committed mistake
No. 3. It decided that Boris Yeltsin's political fate was vital to
the U.S. national interest, and ordered the IMF to undertake yet
another expensive and predictably doomed rescue.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, here we are. Basic principles of economics have defeated
the might of top guns in Washington. Yeltsin and his friends have
sunk with the ruble, and the bottom has not been reached. What can
be done?
</P>
<P>
   Wisely, the Russian authorities have suspended servicing their
debt. They had to pay enormous interest, which can only be
explained by the expectation of a forthcoming default.
</P>
<P>
   Investors who now complain about debt suspension are less than
candid. Even if they end up with half of what they were promised,
it will still turn out to be the best deal of the year, courtesy of
millions of impoverished Russians.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities must also stop fixing the exchange rate. Their
stubborn defense of the ruble was really a guarantee offered to
Russian banks which had borrowed heavily in dollars. The price tag
is in the billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   If banks fail, this will only be fair. Failed banks can be sold,
and there will be plenty of takers from the West if they are not
kept out by powerful lobbies and if the price is right. At last
Russia will have banks which resemble those that you find
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Finally comes the essential part: collection of taxes. Until
this is done, Russia will go on from crisis to crisis, gradually
imploding in the way Latin America did in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   There is only one way: Apply the law. But this requires cutting
the link between politics, business and finance. Yeltsin has shown
over and over again that he will not do that. He backed Prime
Minister Sergei Kiriyenko on many tough decisions but he did not

   TAULIGNAN, France _ Yet another huge IMF-sponsored rescue
package has promptly fizzled out. Billions of dollars have been
spent to no avail. Disasters of this magnitude occur far too often
these days.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the Russian meltdown is a tale of bad economic and
political judgment, in the West and in the East.
</P>
<P>
   There was nothing deeply wrong with the ruble. True, the fall in
oil prices has hurt Russia badly, and a moderate depreciation could
have helped. But the problem is elsewhere, and everybody knows it:
The federal government is increasingly unable to collect taxes,
which have fallen from 20 percent of GDP in 1992 to 8 percent this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Russian authorities have managed to contain the budget deficit,
but they have done it the wrong way, by not paying what they owe.
</P>
<P>
   In today's Russia nobody feels that dues must be paid, not the
government and not the taxpayers. Why pay if there is no sanction?
</P>
<P>
   From headquarters just as lavish as those in New York or London,
Russian banks and corporations engage in big commercial deals, make
their top executives immensely rich, they claim that they cough up
a few kopecks and carry on.
</P>
<P>
   If tax collection goes on declining, there is no way the
government can service its debt. This is what triggered the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Domestic and foreign investors alike scrambled to the exit door.
Pundits certified that the ruble was not overvalued, but there were
no takers. Self-interested financiers convinced the authorities to
buy those rubles, and when the stock of dollars dried out in July,
the IMF provided a new pile which just went down the same tube.
</P>
<P>
   On paper, the IMF conditions for the loan could have solved the
problem. But half of the required measures had to be approved by
the Communist-controlled Duma, which has never passed any
legislation without crippling it.
</P>
<P>
   To meet the other half, the government would have had to get
tough with bad taxpayers, but these are all the president's
friends, and the prime minister (now replaced) was patently weak.
The IMF conditions never had a fighting chance. That was mistake
No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Mistake No. 2 was not to request that the embattled ruble be
allowed to float. Same mistake as in Mexico, as in Asia, and soon
in Brazil and Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF's main shareholder, the United States, committed mistake
No. 3. It decided that Boris Yeltsin's political fate was vital to
the U.S. national interest, and ordered the IMF to undertake yet
another expensive and predictably doomed rescue.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, here we are. Basic principles of economics have defeated
the might of top guns in Washington. Yeltsin and his friends have
sunk with the ruble, and the bottom has not been reached. What can
be done?
</P>
<P>
   Wisely, the Russian authorities have suspended servicing their
debt. They had to pay enormous interest, which can only be
explained by the expectation of a forthcoming default.
</P>
<P>
   Investors who now complain about debt suspension are less than
candid. Even if they end up with half of what they were promised,
it will still turn out to be the best deal of the year, courtesy of
millions of impoverished Russians.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities must also stop fixing the exchange rate. Their
stubborn defense of the ruble was really a guarantee offered to
Russian banks which had borrowed heavily in dollars. The price tag
is in the billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   If banks fail, this will only be fair. Failed banks can be sold,
and there will be plenty of takers from the West if they are not
kept out by powerful lobbies and if the price is right. At last
Russia will have banks which resemble those that you find
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Finally comes the essential part: collection of taxes. Until
this is done, Russia will go on from crisis to crisis, gradually
imploding in the way Latin America did in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   There is only one way: Apply the law. But this requires cutting
the link between politics, business and finance. Yeltsin has shown
over and over again that he will not do that. He backed Prime
Minister Sergei Kiriyenko on many tough decisions but he did not
let him touch big business.
</P>
<P>
   He has now brought back Viktor Chernomyrdin, whose main
political asset is immobilism. Too bad. Someone else will have to
do the job of establishing a market economy, one where either you
pay your dues or you go to jail. It's as simple as that. All the
rest is pie in the sky. &QL;

CLINTON HAS LITTLE ROOM FOR ABSOLUTION IN WASHINGTON 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ALBERTO HUERTA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ At a recent luncheon with essayist and
television commentator Richard Rodriguez and a small group of very
bright Harvard and University of San Francisco graduates, I
suggested that in Protestant, puritan and prudish America,
President Clinton was slowly becoming a Catholic. He seemed to be
developing a deeper sense of sin, the fallen state of humankind,
and the need to confess.
</P>
<P>
   In the president's address to the nation, he admitted to an
inappropriate relationship with a White House intern, which he said
was wrong. He said he would do whatever it took to make this right
with his wife, his daughter and his God.
</P>
<P>
   If the president were a Catholic, which he is not, would his
words hold up under the rigor of a Catholic confession? Would he
receive absolution? Catholic confession is understood as the
Sacrament of Reconciliation, bringing the penitent back to some
original state of grace that has been lost by sin.
</P>
<P>
   In confession, a priest ascertains: the gravity of the sin;
contrition; and a firm purpose of amendment. To some degree, the
last two conditions must be present for the priest to administer
absolution, and then give a penance.
</P>
<P>
   When a person confesses, he or she acknowledges guilt and the
need for forgiveness. For example, if the penitent says he is
having a relationship with someone, the priest asks if he is single
or married. If single, whether they plan at some later date to
marry? If married, whether the penitent can separate himself from
the occasion that is harming the Sacrament of Marriage.
</P>
<P>
   By having an affair outside of marriage, Clinton has committed
adultery. However, the New Testament reminds us that Jesus tells
those accusing the adulterous woman, ``Let he who is without sin
cast the first stone'' _ that we are all in a fallen state.
Adultery can be forgiven. Clinton confessed that by his actions, he
harmed his family and many others. We also know that his affair
with the intern is over. He is concerned with making things right
again.
</P>
<P>
   When a priest hears a penitent admit he or she has harmed
others, and expresses a willingness to make this right again, the
priest is satisfied that contrition has been articulated. And if
the penitent is able and willing to separate himself from whatever
is endangering his spiritual side of grace, the priest knows he has
expressed a firm purpose of amendment.
</P>
<P>
   In Clinton's speech to the nation, he admitted wrongdoing and a
desire to repair the damage he had inflicted on those close to him.
In a Catholic confession, he would receive absolution and penance.
Both his confession and penance would be confidential under the
Seal of Confession.
</P>
<P>
   In politically charged Washington, however, punishment is often
sought for a public confession _ one having little to do with
forgiveness, and less with reconciliation.

CLINTON'S PERSONAL DISGRACE UNDERMINES `WELFARE REFORM' 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STAR PARKER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ As the growing chorus of bipartisan voices is
making clear, President Clinton has lost the moral authority to
lead. The upcoming two-year anniversary of welfare reform should
make this fact crystal clear. That's right, welfare reform.
</P>
<P>
   Sexual promiscuity is the unaddressed underbelly of welfare that
could minimize the effectiveness of the historic 1996 reform bill.
Government legislation can only go so far in cleaning up the
horrible mess created by 30 years of the welfare state. We need a
moral leader to navigate the difficult terrain that encompasses
moral and spiritual repair of the social fabric in urban America.
</P>
<P>
   If President Clinton wants to say that the whole Lewinsky matter
is all about sex, fine. Let's talk about sex. While it is true that
the government played a large role in the illegitimacy rates that
began soaring in 1965 _ the year Lyndon Johnson changed the welfare
laws to financially encourage young mothers to stay single, jobless
and without any savings _ there's one fact to keep in mind. Babies
aren't made outside of marriage without sexual promiscuity.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1960s, the sexual revolution sent the message to
women over the nation's loudspeaker that one could have sex without
consequences. Rather than use the time-honored practice of social
scolding for such irresponsibility, the nation, including black
churches in our cities, turned a blind eye toward destructive
personal behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Now Bill Clinton has decided that lewd acts with a government
intern, only slightly older than his own daughter, in the Oval
Office _ the people's office _ are none of the public's business.
If we allow that attitude to take hold, we're setting a dangerous
precedent for the nation as a whole, not just the office of the
presidency. The very man who signed into law a welfare reform bill
designed to increase personal responsibility is now claiming that
his sexual irresponsibility is his own private business.
</P>
<P>
   We've gotten to the sad point where more than seven of every 10
black babies born today are fatherless, precisely because we've
permitted sexual promiscuity to become socially acceptable.
Forgiveness is one thing, acceptance is quite another.
</P>
<P>
   Even if we personally forgive Clinton, we can neither accept nor
condone his actions. How can he stand before a group of women
seeking to leave welfare and tell them to take responsibility for
their actions when as the leader of the Free World he couldn't keep
his pants zipped in the Oval Office with a 21-year-old intern?
</P>
<P>
   He can't. His efforts to 'fess up amounted to, ``I take
responsibility, but it's Ken Starr's fault.''
</P>
<P>
   Excuse me? That's like a welfare mom saying, ``It was my
responsibility, but society made me do it.''
</P>
<P>
   That simply doesn't cut it. As humans, when we screw up, we need
to repent and try to make right what we made wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than take the respectable path of remorse and
restitution, Clinton hides behind the cloak of religion in a
pathetic search for sympathy. He asks forgiveness. He brings Jesse
Jackson, a minister with no church besides CNN, for counseling on
this ``private matter.'' Clinton doesn't pray, he preys _ on young
women working beneath him, something he has done with impunity.
</P>
<P>
   Only the wicked and the weak would ``spin'' religion. Clinton
has shown, in reprehensible fashion, that he is all too willing to
let others take the fall for him and that responsibility is a last
ditch resort.

<P>
   Once again Russia is having a change of government. This is
symptomatic of a dangerous problem. The highly touted ``energetic
technocrat'' whose approval by the legislature was obtained after
much arm-twisting is out. The acting prime minister is Viktor
Chernomyrdin, sourly dismissed a few months ago.
</P>
<P>
   The pundits are at a loss wondering how to interpret these
developments. The answer, however, is simple. Another attempt to
force a set of impossible economic programs on the country has
failed. Now our failed leaders are casting about for a straw to
grasp.
</P>
<P>
   The failure of the policy course pursued since 1992 is so
obvious that it has now been recognized officially.
</P>
<P>
   The country is being swept by a new devastating wave of the
financial crisis. The stock market hits new lows every day. Despite
having obtained multibillion dollar loans abroad, the Russian
government has been forced to take emergency measures to halt the
free-fall or at least to ease the economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The devaluation of the ruble and the real threat of bankruptcy
have demonstrated that the system born of the reckless, selfishly
conceived reforms of the 1990s is unsustainable. A speculative
economy, a corrupt government, a criminalized environment, tens of
millions of forgotten and abandoned people: Such is the outcome of
the Yeltsin era.
</P>
<P>
   The defining fact today is the credibility gap dividing the
authorities and Russian society. The crisis is not so much economic
as political.
</P>
<P>
   Until very recently, the president and his entourage tried to
ignore this fact. Today they seem to be waking up to what's
happening. Continuing to cling to power while closing their eyes
and plugging their ears could be self-defeating. The appointment of
Chernomyrdin as acting prime minister is therefore likely to signal
the beginning of the process of transferring power to an heir
apparent. We are witnessing Yeltsin's political sunset.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there is a hidden agenda here. By all indications, the
president wants to use Chernomyrdin to try to prolong his political
existence, to somehow make it to the constitutionally mandated
election time. The new premier has thus been assigned the role of
the chief firefighter called in to save the regime.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Chernomyrdin too needs time to raise his
extremely low popularity rating in preparation for presidential
elections. The prime minister's office gives him leverage to do
that, but it is unlikely that he will succeed, given the depth of
the crisis and the current lineup of political forces.
</P>
<P>
   But is there perhaps some hope that the ``heavyweight''
Chernomyrdin has been called in for a different purpose _ that at
long last he will form a government capable of changing the course.
</P>
<P>
   Much as one might wish to believe it, it is unlikely. The
extraordinary difficulties Russia is experiencing today began, as
everyone knows, on Chernomyrdin's watch and with his involvement.
Thus the reemergence of Chernomyrdin does nothing to address the
federal authority's credibility problem. It does not create the
trust needed to solve any major issue.
</P>
<P>
   The call for early elections, therefore, continues to be timely
and urgent. Indeed, early elections of the president and of the
Duma, which bears its share of responsibility for what has happened
to Russia, are indispensable, as is a referendum to amend the
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   I am convinced that the role of the legislature should be
increased. It is very important to normalize the presidency. Russia
needs a balanced system of institutions of government. Only a
strong, functional parliament and an effective cabinet and
president can implement policies of economic growth and Russia's
revival.
</P>
<P>
   The state has to play an essential regulating role to help
realize the country's enormous potential.
</P>
<P>
   Today conditions are still in place to conduct early elections
in an orderly way, taking advantage of the fact that the widespread
popular discontent has not yet burst out in extreme forms. But the
legendary patience of the Russian people should not be tested too
long. It has its limits.

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Once again Russia is having a change of government. This is
symptomatic of a dangerous problem. The highly touted ``energetic
technocrat'' whose approval by the legislature was obtained after
much arm-twisting is out. The acting prime minister is Viktor
Chernomyrdin, sourly dismissed a few months ago.
</P>
<P>
   The pundits are at a loss wondering how to interpret these
developments. The answer, however, is simple. Another attempt to
force a set of impossible economic programs on the country has
failed. Now our failed leaders are casting about for a straw to
grasp.
</P>
<P>
   The failure of the policy course pursued since 1992 is so
obvious that it has now been recognized officially.
</P>
<P>
   The country is being swept by a new devastating wave of the
financial crisis. The stock market hits new lows every day. Despite
having obtained multibillion dollar loans abroad, the Russian
government has been forced to take emergency measures to halt the
free-fall or at least to ease the economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The devaluation of the ruble and the real threat of bankruptcy
have demonstrated that the system born of the reckless, selfishly
conceived reforms of the 1990s is unsustainable. A speculative
economy, a corrupt government, a criminalized environment, tens of
millions of forgotten and abandoned people: Such is the outcome of
the Yeltsin era.
</P>
<P>
   The defining fact today is the credibility gap dividing the
authorities and Russian society. The crisis is not so much economic
as political.
</P>
<P>
   Until very recently, the president and his entourage tried to
ignore this fact. Today they seem to be waking up to what's
happening. Continuing to cling to power while closing their eyes
and plugging their ears could be self-defeating. The appointment of
Chernomyrdin as acting prime minister is therefore likely to signal
the beginning of the process of transferring power to an heir
apparent. We are witnessing Yeltsin's political sunset.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there is a hidden agenda here. By all indications, the
president wants to use Chernomyrdin to try to prolong his political
existence, to somehow make it to the constitutionally mandated
election time. The new premier has thus been assigned the role of
the chief firefighter called in to save the regime.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Chernomyrdin too needs time to raise his
extremely low popularity rating in preparation for presidential
elections. The prime minister's office gives him leverage to do
that, but it is unlikely that he will succeed, given the depth of
the crisis and the current lineup of political forces.
</P>
<P>
   But is there perhaps some hope that the ``heavyweight''
Chernomyrdin has been called in for a different purpose _ that at
long last he will form a government capable of changing the course.
</P>
<P>
   Much as one might wish to believe it, it is unlikely. The
extraordinary difficulties Russia is experiencing today began, as
everyone knows, on Chernomyrdin's watch and with his involvement.
Thus the reemergence of Chernomyrdin does nothing to address the
federal authority's credibility problem. It does not create the
trust needed to solve any major issue.
</P>
<P>
   The call for early elections, therefore, continues to be timely
and urgent. Indeed, early elections of the president and of the
Duma, which bears its share of responsibility for what has happened
to Russia, are indispensable, as is a referendum to amend the
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   I am convinced that the role of the legislature should be
increased. It is very important to normalize the presidency. Russia
needs a balanced system of institutions of government. Only a
strong, functional parliament and an effective cabinet and
president can implement policies of economic growth and Russia's
revival.
</P>
<P>
   The state has to play an essential regulating role to help
realize the country's enormous potential.
</P>
<P>
   Today conditions are still in place to conduct early elections
in an orderly way, taking advantage of the fact that the widespread
popular discontent has not yet burst out in extreme forms. But the
legendary patience of the Russian people should not be tested too
long. It has its limits.

SUCCESSFUL SOFT-CORE SHOWS PAY THE BILLS FOR CABLE'S QUALITY FARE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He's a pool hustler who dresses to the nines and lives in a
gloriously spacious loft. So the suave swagger he exhibits in
luring her to his bachelor pad is hardly surprising. What is? Only
one bed. But, hey, it's a pretty ``wide'' bed, as he assures her.
``And if you move over there a little,'' he suggests, pointing to
the other side of the bed, ``we could sort of share it.''
</P>
<P>
   Most women I know would sprint for the door after digesting a
loaded line like that. But on Showtime's ``Red Shoe Diaries,'' the
Penthouse Forum of television, fantasy is reality and reality is
fantasy. Sure enough, as a saxophone purrs in the background, her
shirt, then bra, then undies disappear, and so does she, behind his
bare shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   Later, as the two go at it on a pool table, she says in
breathless narration: ``We couldn't get enough of one another.''
</P>
<P>
   I suppose the same could be said for cable and its lust for
late-night erotica. ``Red Shoe Diaries'' has shut down production
after six seasons on the pay cable channel, but it leaves a strange
but true legacy: It was both creator of ``art house'' soft porn and
savior of the kind of quality programming for which pay cable has
also become known.
</P>
<P>
   HBO's exhausting space odyssey ``From the Earth to the Moon''
was a quality miniseries. But its best ratings barely matched the
worst ratings of the channel's ``Real Sex'' series, that occasional
special that could best be described as sexually freaky
infotainment for the swingers set.
</P>
<P>
   Performing just as well for HBO is ``Taxicab Confessions,''
documentaries produced from cameras hidden in Las Vegas taxis
providing viewers with titillating situations such as, for
instance, a woman describing masturbation in frank detail and a
couple having sex in the back seat.
</P>
<P>
   Back on ``Showtime,'' a tamer erotic pleasure, ``Sex in the
City,'' has, in its first season, eclipsed the celebrated ``The
Larry Sanders Show'' in terms of ratings, drawing nearly 2 million
more viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Speak with cable executives in private, and they'll say that
late-night erotic series attract viewers, and the profits help them
pay for the more socially redeeming programs.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until the arrival of ``Red Shoe Diaries'' in 1992 that
programmers began producing their own erotic dramas in place of NR
(no rating) films. Many ran for only a season, but others, like the
French-produced series ``Emmanuelle'' on Cinemax, have stuck around
and become after-hours favorites.
</P>
<P>
   ``Red Shoe Diaries'' was innovative for its time, soft porn that
stayed true to its basic, lusty principles while adding music-video
artiness, jumpy, nervy video cuts and dim mood lighting for a
veneer of upscale, almost snooty, erotica. Lifetime with nudity.
</P>
<P>
   Others, like the exquisitely executed ``The Hunger,'' also on
Showtime, are a cross between the daring of a low-budget
independent film and the cleverness of ``Twilight Zone.'' With
``The Hunger,'' you're reminded of its aims only when the clothes
drop and the camera hangs around to record bare bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, ``Red Shoe Diaries'' gained a measure of
respectability from its narrator, ``X-Files'' star David Duchovny,
who also starred in its two-hour movie launch. The series'
credibility seemed to rise with his growing fame, even though he's
around only to open and close each episode by reading the letters
from conflicted women searching for independence, usually from
boneheaded guys.
</P>
<P>
   HBO declines to break down its viewing demographic, but says
that an equal number of women and men tune in to erotic series such
as ``Red Shoe Diaries;'' Showtime says the same for ``The Hunger.''
</P>
<P>
   And they expect more of the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish there was a bigger audience for things that were either
that smart or that subtle,'' Jeff Bewkes, HBO's chairman and CEO,
said of ``Larry Sanders,'' which recently ended its run. ``But what
can you do? I mean, we keep trying. `From the Earth to the Moon'
did not have a lot of scantily clad people in it. Mostly, they were
dressed up in these moon suits.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that was the problem.

SOLEMNITY AND SLEAZE MINGLE AS TV REMEMBERS PRINCESS DIANA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Returning this week is the Princess Diana media derby, as
network, all-news and cable outlets plan tributes, culminating on
or near the Aug. 31 anniversary of her death in that Paris car
crash.
</P>
<P>
   Call it morbid, but from an economic perspective, it's a little
like Christmas in the retail biz. Di was big business in life; in
death we upgraded her to pseudo-sainthood, eclipsing the real saint
who died days later, Mother Teresa. But then Mother Teresa didn't
represent glamour, beauty, royalty and wealth _ or grace the cover
of People magazine 43 times before her death.
</P>
<P>
   More than 2 billion people worldwide viewed Diana's televised
funeral, even though we in the States had to set alarm clocks to do
it.
</P>
<P>
   Warning: The Di tributes and remembrances range from highbrow to
lowlife; they are alternately somber, sappy, saccharine and sleazy.
What do you expect from E! Entertainment?
</P>
<P>
   The Learning Channel jumped the gun last week with ``Memories of
Diana'' and ``Diana: Secrets Behind the Crash.'' ``Secrets'' made
intriguing assertions (such as that the flashes rumored to have
blinded the driver didn't come from pursuing ``paparazzi'' but from
an anti-personnel stun flash to stop them), but it covered little
new ground for anyone who has stayed on top of the ongoing
developments. (''Secrets'' will air again Nov. 7.)
</P>
<P>
   Expect each network's evening newscast and morning infotainment
show to devote in-depth reports to Diana, and local stations to add
to the clutter, figuring they ought to do ``something.''
</P>
<P>
   Some offerings:
</P>
<P>
   7 p.m. CDT Sunday, MSNBC. Anchor Jodi Applegate hosts a live,
one-hour special from London, the first of scattered reports
throughout the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   7 p.m. Sunday, E! Entertainment. This installment of ``The E!
True Hollywood Story'' examines Diana's life and death with the
usual Diana and Prince Charles footage and interviews, but with
that E! flair.
</P>
<P>
   7 a.m. CDT Monday. ``This Morning'' reports from London with
Jane Robelot co-anchoring and CBS correspondents reporting from
Paris and elsewhere. No word yet whether ``Today'' and ``Good
Morning America'' will follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   7 p.m. CDT Monday, NBC. Richard Attenborough, filmmaker and
friend of Diana, narrates a more personal ``Diana.'' Covering two
hours, it includes interviews with friends, associates,
photographers, magazine editors, columnists, authors and social
commentators who give their views on the impact of Diana's life.
</P>
<P>
   9 p.m. Monday, History Channel. One of the better offerings,
``As It Happened: When Diana Died'' looks back at Diana's death and
examines her legacy and effect on Britain's monarchy. ``It's a more
removed view,'' promises a History Channel spokeswoman. ``It's not
like NBC, which is a reminiscence of Diana as a person. Here we ask
the question: What has she left us?''
</P>
<P>
   And because it's the History Channel, the program also looks at
``parallels in history'' to explain the Diana phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   9 p.m. CDT Friday through Monday, MSNBC. ``Time &AMP; Again's'' Jane
Pauley presents ``The Life &AMP; Death of Princess Diana'' as four
nightly one-hour reports.
</P>
<P>
   9 p.m. CDT Monday, CBS. ``48 Hours'' with Dan Rather updates its
June story about the investigation of Diana's death, including the
potential obstruction of justice by the Ritz Hotel; also, Dodi al
Fayed's butler, Rene Delorm, takes viewers on a tour of the places
Dodi and Diana visited together.
</P>
<P>
   9:30 p.m. CDT Tuesday, MTV. Diana will be the focus of the music
channel's new weekly series, ``BIOrhythm,'' which offers an
intriguing take on the biography genre by telling stories using
only music and footage. ``BIOrhythm: Princess Di'' covers
everything from Diana's 1981 wedding to her funeral. There are
songs from the Smashing Pumpkins, Ella Fitzgerald, Nirvana _ and
Verdi's ``Requiem.'' Hey, at least it's original.

<TEXT>
<P>
   For every bleary-eyed student who tried to hack through the
cluttered verbiage of Othello with the goal of finishing a term
paper before sunrise, this anniversary is for you.
</P>
<P>
   Your buddy Cliffs Notes has turned 40.
</P>
<P>
   That's right, it's the big 4-0 for those handy study guides with
the black-striped covers in a shade of yellow normally reserved for
signs that read ``BIOHAZARD.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lincoln, Neb., company that publishes the pamphlets is
celebrating the milestone in a big way. High school and college
students returning to campus this fall will spot Cliffs commercials
on TV and hear radio ads promoting such offers as free music CDs in
return for buying a quantity of the study guides. And there's a new
Web site that touts real-life stories of how Cliffs saved the day
(www.cliffs.com).
</P>
<P>
   There's plenty to celebrate: Besides selling as many as 5
million copies of the pamphlets annually, along with other test
preparation aids, Cliffs Notes has become part of the American
lexicon.
</P>
<P>
   On TV's Friends, when the rather dense Joey doesn't get the
point of something obvious, his exasperated buddy Chandler
admonishes him, ``Read the Cliffs Notes.''
</P>
<P>
   In the '80s, the staff of The Harvard Lampoon used the familiar
Cliffs format _ biography of author, chapter-by-chapter plot
summaries, character lists and sample essay questions _ to parody
the novels of Bret Easton Ellis, Jay McInerney and Tama Janowitz.
The publisher wasn't amused, but the point was made: Cliffs is a
household name.
</P>
<P>
   How did the company get to the head of its class? Here's the
Cliffs Notes version of the Cliffs Notes' story:
</P>
<P>
   In 1958, at the suggestion of a friend in Canada who wrote study
guides, book salesman Cliff Hillegass (yes, there really is a Cliff
behind Cliffs), decided to publish his own package of pamphlets
condensing Shakespeare's major works. Writing the texts in his
spare time and operating from the basement of his home in Lincoln,
Neb., he borrowed $4,000 to print 32,000 copies. Within a year, he
sold them all.
</P>
<P>
   Despite battling dozens of competitors and copy cat study guides
through the years, Cliffs has maintained its No. 1 status.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've done it for a long time and we're extremely good at what
we do,'' said company president Robert Kovolik.

BORIS &AMP; BILL: USED GOODS TOGETHER IN MOSCOW 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Going to Russia is just the ticket to improve
Bill Clinton's morale. The best healing process for low self-esteem
is to look good in comparison to someone else.
</P>
<P>
   Why not go see Boris Yeltsin, knock back shots of Stoly, do the
twist with some Kremlin interns, and enjoy the company of a world
leader who has more trouble than you do?
</P>
<P>
   That is, if Yeltsin is still there, and hasn't been sent to some
12-step gulag by Boris Berezovsky, the billionaire former used car
dealer who has emerged as the power behind the throne.
</P>
<P>
   Berezovsky is the guy who traded in the last prime minister,
Sergei Kiriyenko, for Victor Chernomyrdin, who already had a lot of
hard miles on him as a preowned prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   And Yeltsin bought the used prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Russia is secretly run by a used car dealer. Clinton should
feel right at home.
</P>
<P>
   Poor Clinton can't win for winning. During the Cuban missile
crisis, his hero, John F. Kennedy, faced down Soviet missiles to
save American civilization. Clinton gets to face down the ruble to
save our 401(k)s.
</P>
<P>
   At least now we know what the K in 401(k) stands for _ Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   This is Clinton's chance to go eyeball-to-eyeball with Yeltsin
and see who is more bloodshot. Show me more market reform, Boris,
and I'll tell you what went on in the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday the Dow plummeted 357 points, and the ruble fell so
far that now anyone in Russia who has a ruble owes the government
money.
</P>
<P>
   As 30-year-old Moscow schoolteacher Tatyana Atamas told a
reporter: ``In my circle there's no panic because there's no
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Do we care? You bet we do. We have money. Well, we have it on
paper, somewhere in the stock market listings. We'd like to be able
to retire.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians are used to being poor. We can't cut it living on
nothing. Only the homeless will be able to survive.
</P>
<P>
   When I was in Moscow 11 years ago near the end of the Soviet
era, nobody used rubles. The authorities tried to make us buy a
bunch so we'd be stuck with them, but we knew enough to buy things
with the strong American currency of dollars and rock 'n' roll
T-shirts.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, there wasn't anything to buy in grocery stores
but three kinds of canned fish from Cuba. Fortunately, there was
plenty of vodka available, and vodka is the perfect wine to go with
mackerel.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow Muscovites managed to get by with humor and dignity,
despite ungratified material desires.
</P>
<P>
   I went into a jewelry store and watched young women ogling
pictures of jewelry in display cases where real jewelry ought to
be.
</P>
<P>
   Now Russians have stuff to buy, but nobody is paying their
salaries.
</P>
<P>
   Think about this, Bill, while you're looking for that McDonald's
in Red Square. For years, we lived in fear of the Kremlin's
powerful missiles, submarines and tanks. Now they're going to wreck
us with their lousy ruble.
</P>
<P>
   Whose idea was this to give the Russians a stock market? It was
like giving them a nuclear device with a built-in chain reaction to
Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   As a friend of mine said, ``The best thing about the Cold War
was that the guys in the Kremlin were mismanaging everything using
their irrational system instead of our irrational system.''
</P>
<P>
   This is Russia. Throughout history its governments have been
excellent at the irrational.
</P>
<P>
   Nikolai Gogol said it best in his 1836 play ``The Inspector
General,'' as nightmarishly bumbling small-town officials prepared
for the arrival of a grand government dignitary: ``The more
destruction there is everywhere, the more it shows the activity of
town authorities.''
</P>
<P>
   Gogol had a ``looking-glass mind,'' as Vladimir Nabokov put it,
and Russia is a looking-glass country.
</P>
<P>
   Communism fell, and with our help Russia got capitalism. It
turns out to be gangster capitalism, exactly as portrayed in old
communist propaganda.
</P>
<P>
   Old-style communists in the Russian parliament now want a return
to centralized control of the economy _ after all, it has a proven
record of working badly.
</P>
<P>
   Capitalism has worked badly too, but not for very long, and
Russia is a country that values tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Russians also like things American, such as Playboy, blue jeans
and, of course, dollars. They bought a lemon of a used prime
minister from a used car dealer. They'll buy whatever Clinton is
selling, and gladly pay for it with rubles.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Some of us are a tad tired of celebs exposing
everything, including their pregnant bellies, on the covers of
magazines. So Miz Hot Tips was impressed that when sexy swimsuit
model Kathy Ireland became visibly pregnant, she not only covered
up but designed a clothing line for herself and other expectant
moms.
</P>
<P>
   According to Ireland, ``Being pregnant is such a jubilant time
in a woman's life ... and when I was pregnant with my first child,
it was difficult to find enough selections that offered comfort and
style at a reasonable price.''
</P>
<P>
   So with budget and boredom on her mind, she launched the Kathy
Ireland Maternity Collection this month at Kmart stores. The
collection includes necessities like jeans and khaki pants, a lot
of stylin' black, and also velour holiday dresses. And take note
that there's not one dumb bow in the entire selection. And, best of
all, Ireland will have new collections arriving each month as your
size (and hers) changes. Most items are priced between $16.99 and
$24.99.
</P>
<P>
   PEEL-PERFECT: Now, for those women who aren't pregnant and have
a figure worthy of a sleek catsuit, read on. The House of Elegance
will make you a leather catsuit similar to the one Uma Thurman wore
as Emma Peel in that new and notably dull film ``The Avengers,''
for $825. It's a custom design, based on the measurements you send
them, and it takes about four weeks for delivery. For information,
write to House of Elegance, P.O. Box 342, Ithaca, N.Y. 14851. Or
call (607) 275-0839.
</P>
<P>
   MALL PATROL: It's another ho-hummer of a weekend, and you're
torn between watching women's wrestling on the tube or going
shopping. Hmmm. Miz Hot Tips knows it's a tough call, but she
suggests getting out in the real world, like Northridge Fashion
Center, which is holding a teen fashion show presented by YM
magazine at 1 p.m. today in the center court.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe the Sunset Plaza mall in West Hollywood, where the Anna
Sui boutique opens today. And at most Macy's stores today and
Sunday, you can get a free ``First Course'' style guide for men
just for trying on a pair of the new Slates pants.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 3, you can get a makeup make-over from artist Mary
Greenwell, who has done the faces of Brooke Shields and even
Princess Diana. She'll be at the Elizabeth Arden counter of
Robinsons-May at the Glendale Galleria between 11 a.m. and 4 p.m.
Call (818) 247-2600, Ext. 2132.
</P>
<P>
   Or get a make-over with an expert from Bobbi Brown Essentials on
the same day at Bloomingdale's in Century City.
</P>
<P>
   Other new stores to look for are Pottery Barn, which opens Sept.
5 at The Oaks mall in Thousand Oaks, and the Monah Li boutique,
which will open Oct. 15 at 1765 Vermont Ave., Los Angeles. Li is an
edgy new designer who's a current nominee for the CaliforniaMart's
Rising Star Award.
</P>
<P>
   GET SMART: Always wish you knew how to talk opera? The Los
Angeles Opera League will have you knowing one aria from another in
no time with its new opera seminar series that kicks off at 9 a.m.
Sept. 5 with a discussion of Bizet's ``Carmen'' and Massenet's
tragic romance, ``Werther.'' Admission is $15, and the location is
Hotel Inter-Continental Los Angeles, 251 S. Olive St., Los Angeles.
For more information, call (213) 972-7220.
</P>
<P>
   MYSTERY MASH: If you just can't take all those people singing at
the top of their lungs to each other, maybe you'd prefer a quiet
little murder. To introduce you to some of the best contemporary
mystery writers, UCLA Extension is offering ``Murder They Write:
Six Evenings with Premier Mystery Writers.'' The authors who will
help you explore the fine art of murder through conversations and
short readings include Jan Burke, author of ``Goodnight, Irene,''
and Michael Connelly of ``Blood Work.'' The class fee is $210, and
the first class is 7 p.m. Oct. 15. To register, call (818)
784-7006.
</P>
<P>
   A CHICHI NEIGHBORHOOD: Finally, you can make yourself at home in
Hancock Park. You know, that ritzy neighborhood where celebs like
Mr. Blackwell live? Anyway, at 1 p.m. Sunday the Hancock Park
Historical Society will take you on a walking tour of Windsor
Square to visit seven homes and gardens built in the '20s by
leading architects.
</P>
<P>
   Miz Hot Tips hopes you'll remember your party manners and not
touch anything. And also wear flat, soft-soled shoes that won't
scratch wooden floors. Reservations are $25, and the number to call
is (213) 243-8182.

   GREAT BRINGTON, England _ Dorothy Jackson talks about a friend
who's gone away.
</P>
<P>
   She sits with her closest friends in a circle of folding chairs
arrayed around coolers topped with an assortment of quiches, fancy
cheeses, green salads and two nearly empty bottles of good white
wine. They await their appointed time to enter Althorp House,
Princess Diana's childhood home and final resting place. This
refined tailgate party is set between the neat rows of cars parked
in the grassy field that serves as a parking lot across a gravel
road from the grand country manor. With all the Mercedes, BMWs and
even a Rolls Royce in the lot, it is clear this isn't Graceland.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had mixed feelings about this, actually,'' Jackson says with
both guilt and reverence in her voice. ``We were coming to Diana's
memorial, yet we were making it festive with a picnic.''
</P>
<P>
   She pauses and then continues on a new track. ``We've really
come to celebrate her life. She was a very lively extroverted kind
of character, so we've come to celebrate her.''
</P>
<P>
   Her cousin, John Massey, a courtly man wearing a navy blazer and
honey-colored necktie, chimes in cheerfully. ``I'm sure she's
looking down and thoroughly approving.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hmm,'' Jackson says approvingly. ``Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Then a sadness emerges in her voice. ``I miss her. I miss the
color that she brought to everyday life,'' she says. ``Suddenly,
she would be on the front of the paper or you would open the
newspaper and she was there, doing something, always. She gave this
feeling of, whatever she suffered, she was quite a light, wasn't
she?''
</P>
<P>
   To Jackson and her friends -- and to millions more worldwide --
Princess Diana of Wales still represents a powerful combination of
the glamorous and familiar.
</P>
<P>
   Despite her privileged and aristocratic background -- some say
her lineage was more royal than the royals -- she connected to
ordinary folks. They talk about her as if they hung out with her at
Kensington Palace, and shopped with her in the Sloane Street
boutiques. They know the failings of her marriage, her successes as
a mother and hold well-developed positions on her peculiar
relationship with the press.
</P>
<P>
   In the way that Americans over the age of 40 can tell you where
they were when they got news of President John F. Kennedy's
assassination, many Britons have fixed in their minds the moment
they learned about Diana tragic accident.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, a year after her death, Diana remains alive in the press,
still young and beautiful. Her blue eyes radiate from the front
pages of tabloid newspapers that hounded her in life. Television
chat shows and news magazines frequently re-hash the familiar story
of the black Mercedes slamming into the 13th pillar of the famed
Parisian tunnel resulting in the violent death of a 36-year-old
woman whose warmth and vulnerability touched so many people.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, virtually all major London dailies carried special
magazine sections marking the anniversary of her death. Taking note
of the potential for Diana overkill, a London Times media writer
recently used his computer to determine that the word ``Diana'' had
been used in news stories in the British press 72 times in a
three-day period of mid-July.
</P>
<P>
   Her life has been a rich mine for other media, as well. In
addition to a seemingly endless supply of books, authorized and
otherwise, two new Diana plays have opened here. There is talk of a
Walt Disney Co. movie.
</P>
<P>
   At times, the industry of commemoration has slipped into
exploitation.
</P>
<P>
   The Diana souvenir business has been brisk with an estimated
$165 million in sales to date. In gift shops throughout London's
touristy districts are Diana coffee cups, plates, posters, T-shirts
and yes, souvenir thimbles, piled high in gift shops.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers from Diana's estate and the Diana, Princess of Wales
Memorial Fund have been deployed to rein in the numerous
unauthorized uses of her image and name.
</P>
<P>
   They may have to work extra billable hours to keep up with the
inspirations of enterprise. One Parisian hotel is offering what can
only be described as a brief tour of Diana's death. ``I am simply
responding to demand from my clients,'' an unabashed Emile
Cacciari, manager of the three-star Odeon Hotel on the Left Bank,
told Reuters news agency.
</P>
<P>
   For $25 -- free to guests -- Cacciari is offering the chance to
relive Diana's final moments. For a little more, he can provide the
authenticity of a black Mercedes. ``We have a lot of American
visitors, and whenever they leave the hotel in the morning they
want to know two things and two things only: where is the Eiffel
Tower, and where is the Pont de l'Alma. People want to go (to the
scene of the crash); it's as simple as that.''
</P>
<P>
   The proceeds, he said, will be donated to the memorial fund.
</P>
<P>
   There are varying schools of thought about Diana's lasting
legacy here. Some people believe she has permanently altered
British life, as if people impressed by the warmth of her example
now have come in touch with their feelings and have opened up.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Lashmar, a London man who was at the gates of Kensington
Palace the night the city learned of her death, believes the
experience has helped Britons get in touch with their feelings. ``I
think we've definitely grown up since then,'' he says. ``I don't
think we would have behaved the way we do with the outpouring of
grief, and (us) being afraid to cry in public. I mean, that night
there were grown men of all shapes, sizes and descriptions crying
their eyes out.''
</P>
<P>
   The mourning has never really stopped. Bouquets with handwritten
notes still appear faithfully at Kensington Palace -- Diana's
former home -- where the world kept a televised vigil in the days
after her death.
</P>
<P>
   Despite such public displays, there are those who believe the
outpourings have been misinterpreted.
</P>
<P>
   Decca Aitkenhead, a columnist for the Independent newspaper
here, said on a recent TV chat show that she believes people were
moved more by the larger-than-life proportions of Diana's life,
death and celebrity than by real feelings for the woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kinds of emotional outpourings we saw in the week after
her death were genuine in so far as they were real emotions,''
Aitkenhead said. ``The mistake was to interpret them as grief, that
people were grieving for Diana. I think what people were
demonstrating was their desire to feel a part of a big momentous
occasion, to feel a part of history, to feel they can suddenly talk
to strangers and they could bond in queues waiting to write in a
condolence book.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I think as the year has passed, we're seeing it fade into
something that's just closer to sentimentality rather than a new
emotional maturity.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed a new study suggests that Britain was not as united in
its grief as the TV images suggested. Research by the British Film
Institute suggests that many people here were displeased that so
much airtime was consumed by the commotion surrounding Diana's
death. Nearly 40 percent of the 500 people surveyed said the
coverage was excessive and overly sentimental. Many were irritated
that soaps, soccer and cricket matches were sacrificed to the
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, but whatever it is, it persists.
</P>
<P>
   Within a week of going on sale, tickets to Althorp House were
snapped up by 152,000 people like Jackson and her friends. More
than 3,000 people a day have passed through Althorp's gates since
the estate was opened to the public July 1. Inside they find an
exhibit describing Diana's journey from gawky bride to
sophisticated patron. It ends with a visit to her grave on a small
island in a lake on the estate. Althorp's gates will close for the
year on Sunday(Aug. 30), the eve of the first anniversary of
Diana's death in a car crash in Paris' Pont de l'Alma traffic
tunnel, along with her boyfriend, Dodi Fayed and driver Henri Paul.
It has not been determined when they will open in 1999, a
spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   In Paris, where sentimentality is aggressively spurned, a
candlelit march on Monday(Aug. 31), to mark the moment of her death
is expected to draw 10,000 mourners. The underpass, where emergency
workers struggled to save the fatally injured Diana, has become a
point of pilgrimage for hundreds of people each day.
</P>
<P>
   And a recent opinion poll showed that 70 percent of Parisians
want a nearby boulevard renamed to honor the late princess.
However, the city's mayor has responded by saying that Parisian
streets and buildings cannot be dedicated to celebrities until they
have been dead for five years.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Purkins, who heads the memorial fund in Diana's name,
believes there is something deeper to her appeal. This, in part
because of her embrace of poor people and people on the margins,
and of causes such as Third World Poverty, AIDS research and
ridding the world of land mines that have in the past made the
British aristocracy squeamish.
</P>
<P>
   Diana's genuine regard for ordinary and damaged people will
stick, he said. ``That's something people instinctively know should
endure and is important, and is something that can be distinguished
from the more transitory emotions.''
</P>
<P>
   The fund, with a balance of nearly $80 million -- more than $30
million of which came from the proceeds of Elton John's ``Candle in
the Wind'' tribute -- intends to give $8 million to $10 million a
year to causes that trustees believe Diana would have supported.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps her most lasting influence is a change in the perceived
way the Royal Family interacts with the public. At times, this
regal populism can be awkward as with the recent visit by Queen
Elizabeth to a McDonald's restaurant. Perhaps fortunately, she
didn't order any food, saving a counter worker from having to utter
the phrase, ``And would one wish to have one's order
'Super-sized?'''
</P>
<P>
   Queen Elizabeth, who was accused of not emoting sufficiently
after Diana's death, ordered flags at royal residences to fly at
half-mast on Monday(Aug. 31), to mark the first anniversary of
Diana's death.
</P>
<P>
   The queen and husband, Prince Philip will be joined by Prince
Charles and sons William and Harry, for family prayers at Crathie
Church, just outside the grounds of Balmoral Castle in Scotland.
Also at the service will be Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife,
Cherie. William, now 16, and Harry, 13, were told of Diana's death
by Charles while they were staying at Balmoral last summer.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest change in image has come to Prince Charles, once
vilified for being cold-hearted to the genial Diana. While still
far from hugging his future subjects in public, the prince is often
seen with his two sons in comfortable ordinary surroundings, the
picture of the modern dad.
</P>
<P>
   Less than four months after the crash, an opinion poll suggested
public approval of Charles had leaped nearly 20 points, from 42
percent last August to 61 percent in December.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun, that tabloid that dispensed its share of vitriol at
Charles' expense, patted him on the back this summer and even
advised him to go public with his longtime affair with Camilla
Parker Bowles -- once arguably the most hated woman in England.
</P>
<P>
   One of the new plays about Diana, ``Love Upon the Throne''
offers Charles a kind of forgiveness by expressing on his behalf,
sentiments he never would have shared in public -- even if he
really felt them. At the end of the play, the Charles character
utters these words to the stage Diana: ``I'm very, very, very sorry
for not loving you as I should have.''
</P>
<P>
   Waiting to pay her respects at Diana's grave, Jackson, dressed
in a tasteful dark dress selected with Diana inspired sensibilities
-- expresses the common feeling toward the princess.
</P>
<P>
   ``She became a legend in my lifetime and that's not something
one often experiences really,'' she said. ``She did leave a mark on
the world, and it's quite remarkable.''
</P>
<P>
   Her explanation of Diana's appeal is that the princess, despite
her advantages, was an underdog who survived in a hostile world and
in so doing discovered herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``She could have been a recluse and hidden from the world in the
later years, but she went off to help people. She decided to do
this herself, and that's what makes it all the more commendable.''
</P>
<P>
   She sips her wine thoughtfully.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had the opportunity -- no, we all had the opportunity -- to
see a human being flower.''

<P>
   LONDON _ Despite a year of deliberations by a jury of talk
shows, newspapers and authors, the real trial has yet to begin.
</P>
<P>
   And at the rate this investigation is proceeding, it may well
become known as the ``Trial of the Next Century.''
</P>
<P>
   In stark contrast to high-profile cases in the United States,
the French inquiry into who caused the death of Princess Diana of
Wales has been conducted with nearly absolute stealth.
</P>
<P>
   Magistrate Herve Stephan, who under French law has the powers of
judge, investigator and prosecutor, has succeeded in shrouding the
probe in the strict secrecy that French law requires.
</P>
<P>
   In a rare statement last week, Stephan said the investigation
would end in October, when several ongoing tests are concluded. It
was the first statement prosecutors had issued since the early days
of the case. It was released to respond to the crush of media
queries surrounding the anniversary of Diana's death.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators are still trying to determine the meaning of
abnormally high levels of carbon monoxide in the blood of driver
Henri Paul, who was killed in the crash, the prosecutors said.
Blood tests also found that he was heavily drunk.
</P>
<P>
   The origin of the carbon monoxide isn't clear, but the gas can
cause dizziness, headaches, nausea and disorientation -- even
leaving a person in a coma.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators also are reviewing the efforts to treat Diana at
the crash site. It is common in France to treat even seriously
injured people at crash sites, a practice that differs from
thinking in the United States that patients should be taken
immediately to the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   A third probe involves lab tests on the body of the wrecked
black Mercedes. Forensic tests are being conducted on the crashed
car to determine if it had been brushed by a mysterious Fiat before
the accident. Investigators said they had interviewed nearly 3,000
owners of Fiat Unos and reportedly have come up empty.
</P>
<P>
   Police also have interviewed 153 people as potential witnesses
to the crash, but the investigators did not reveal any of their
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Only when the report by Stephan and his colleague, magistrate
Marie-Christine Devidal, is issued will it be determined who, if
anyone, will be criminally charged. A criminal trial would be open
to the press and public, even though no television cameras will be
allowed, said a spokesman for the court in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   As it stands, the only people in clear legal jeopardy are the
paparazzi who were trailing -- some say, chasing -- the Mercedes
that night, and who have been widely condemned for their part in
the world's most famous car crash.
</P>
<P>
   Ten men -- nine photographers and the driver of one of the
motorcycles giving chase -- have been in legal limbo since the
early days following the accident. At that point, they were placed
under formal investigation on charges of both manslaughter and
failure to assist people in danger.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses have not agreed on the behavior of the photographers,
however, with some saying they were following too closely and
others saying they kept a safe distance before the crash.
</P>
<P>
   None of the paparazzi -- some of whom still work Diana-related
events -- has been formally charged.
</P>
<P>
   In early June, Stephan summoned the paparazzi to give secret
testimony. Also present were Mohamed Al Fayed, the father of Dodi
Al Fayed, who also perished in the crash. Frances Shand Kydd,
Diana's mother, was also there to hear the testimony.
</P>
<P>
   There have been no reliable leaks of the testimony, but some
news reports have said that those close to the case believe all 10
will be cleared of the manslaughter charges. However, some may go
to trial on the non-assistance charge, facing minor penalties,
perhaps a fine.
</P>
<P>
   But questions remain about other aspects of the case. It is
unclear how much management at the Paris Ritz Hotel, which Diana
and Al Fayed were leaving, knew about Henri Paul's condition. That
factor could come into play in determining the prestigious hotel's
liability in the case.
</P>
<P>
   And what about bodyguard Trevor Rees-Jones, the sole survivor of
the crash? Six months ago, his story was that Paul appeared fine
that night -- that he wasn't visibly drunk. But that was before he
resigned from the employ Mohamed Al Fayed, owner of the Ritz.
</P>
<P>
   The latest clue comes in the form of new charges about the
mechanical condition of the car itself. It has been widely reported
here that a person familiar with the Mercedes has told
investigators that the car's brakes were faulty, making it
especially difficult to brake suddenly.
</P>
<P>
   It is not known whether Etoile Limousines, which rented the car
to the Ritz, warned the hotel about the problems.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps seeking to learn more about these matters, Stephan
Tuesday questioned two key witnesses: the president of the Ritz
Hotel, Frank Klein, and its director, Claude Roulet.
</P>
<P>
   With prospects of civil litigation and even more criminal
investigations, Stephan's report is likely to signal only the end
of the beginning.

   LONDON _ On his swim trunks are the letters ``W.O.W.''
</P>
<P>
   They stand for ``William of Wales,'' but it also pretty well
sums up the popular sentiment here for the eldest son of Princess
Diana and the most likely heir to her title of lead character in
the ongoing national melodrama.
</P>
<P>
   With his blond locks, shy ways and brilliant blue eyes, it is
hard to look at William and not see Diana.
</P>
<P>
   He has demonstrated a grasp of her ``common'' touch while
showing signs that he is quickly developing a charisma of his own.
On the day of his mother's funeral last year, William graciously
received flowers handed him by mourners outside Buckingham Palace,
a notable personal touch given the awkwardness exhibited by his
royal relatives. Britain was charmed.
</P>
<P>
   A new national survey placed him No. 2 on the list of most
popular royals, just behind Princess Anne, the queen's only
daughter. Prince Charles, his father, was at the bottom of the
list.
</P>
<P>
   His rare public appearances have created remarkable reactions.
Girls whose mothers -- and perhaps grandmothers -- no doubt
shrieked for the Beatles, do the same for the 6-foot-1 William,
whose mother, according to one author, teased her son by calling
him ``DDG'' -- for drop dead gorgeous.
</P>
<P>
   During a visit to Vancouver in March he was besieged by frantic
girls, an experience that friends, always quoted anonymously in the
British press, said frightened him to the bone.
</P>
<P>
   When he turned 16 in June, the well-behaved newspapers were
rewarded with the transcript of a very tame interview that
essentially confirmed that William is a teenager with a teenager's
likes and dislikes.
</P>
<P>
   He loves sports: particularly rugby, soccer, swimming, water
polo and tennis. He likes action movies and loves his black lab,
Widgeon. He likes techno pop music, and apparently the Spice Girls
(he met the girl-power group during a visit to South Africa) but
also has an ear for the classics.
</P>
<P>
   Lucinda Kennedy, a hair stylist from Surrey, offers the theory
that people are hoping that William can help fill the gap left in
their lives by the death of his mother. ``You know it reminds me of
the way that people tried to put John Lennon's son, you know, Sean,
out front after his father was murdered,'' she said. ``That's a
right raw thing to do, but they do it, don't they?''
</P>
<P>
   They seem to be trying. William is a tantalizing topic for a
British media eager to fill the void created by Diana's death.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing this, Buckingham Palace has worked vigorously to
protect his, and younger brother Harry's privacy. Indiscretions
that seem minor compared to the wild, intrusive treatment afforded
Diana are not tolerated.
</P>
<P>
   When a newspaper reported that William was selecting girls for
invitations to tea, the teenager filed an official complaint with
the Press Complaint Commission, leading to a rebuke.
</P>
<P>
   When William and 13-year-old Harry met in private for 30 minutes
with Camilla Parker-Bowles, Prince Charles' long-time love
interest, the tabloid Sun got the scoop of the year for a
three-page spread, photos and all --much to the outrage of the
palace.
</P>
<P>
   But, for the most part, the British media, perhaps chastened by
the public's hostility after Diana's death, have provided William
the space to grow up in as normal an environment as can be expected
for a future king.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, even as William prepares return to his studies at the elite
prep-school Eton, there remain some misgivings about the attention
heading his way.
</P>
<P>
   There even have been calls for tougher laws written specifically
to protect the princes.
</P>
<P>
   ``To rely on the decency of the media is ludicrous,'' wrote
Libby Purves, a columnist for The Times of London. ``The princes
should be allowed to walk freely in their own country, take risks,
make decisions and grow up without being spied on.''

 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The idea of multimedia-based magazines has been
around for a few years now, ever since CD-ROMs came along.
</P>
<P>
   But the huge space demands of video mean CD-ROMs are quickly
filled. Despite the best efforts of Launch and other CD-based
magazines, the medium has proved just a little too cramped to be
truly satisfying.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes DVD, which can pack as much as 17 gigabytes of
information on a single disk (about 26 times what can be put on a
CD-ROM). And along comes DVD Mags, a Venice-based company that is
trying to be first on the shelves with DVD publications.
</P>
<P>
   The company's first product, now on its third issue, is the
year-old Short Cinema Journal, which spotlights top-flight short
films, animation and documentaries from the past several decades,
along with interviews of directors and performers.
</P>
<P>
   What they've created is a treasure for anyone who enjoys film,
especially shorter works.
</P>
<P>
   The company's marketing director Scott Epstein defines short as
less than half an hour, and said the form is perfect for people
using DVD-ROM drives on their computer, where they're less likely
to want to watch an entire two-hour film but will watch shorter
pieces when they can.
</P>
<P>
   The first three ``Short'' issues, all still available, include
wonderful stuff such as ``Some Folks Call It a Slingblade,'' the
sort of prequel that led Billy Bob Thornton to ``Slingblade''; ``La
Jetee,'' the acclaimed piece that inspired ``12 Monkeys''; and
Alain Resnais' ``Night and Fog.''
</P>
<P>
   The animation includes award-winning pieces by Will Vinton and
others; the interviews and documentary work look at people such as
Jane Campion, Michael Apted and Henry Rollins.
</P>
<P>
   Just as importantly, the DVD format's extra elbow room allows
the company to present the films with much higher quality than the
choppy, tiny formats that have plagued CD-ROMs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think when people see our stuff, it's vastly different''
from CD-ROM, Epstein said. ``It's not the little QuickTime
pictures; it's full-screen video.''
</P>
<P>
   And the video is smooth, not choppy, with great stereo sound.
It's actually much better than even VHS videotape. And as long as
the company keeps finding great films, it'll have a keeper.
</P>
<P>
   The company also has put out ``The Young Cinematographer,'' a
collection of award-winning pieces by children and young artists.
And it plans to begin selling a DVD-based music magazine, called
Circuit, in December, Epstein said.
</P>
<P>
   The company (www.dvdmags.com) is betting that DVDs will be the
next big thing _ a safe bet, given projections of 40 million DVD
players by 2000 (compared to half a billion CD players worldwide).
</P>
<P>
   LUANCH STILL A GO: Despite the looming threat of DVD, the folks
over at Santa Monica-based Launch don't sound too worried about the
future of their 3-year-old bimonthly CD-ROM, which focuses on
music, movies and other entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Company CEO Dave Goldberg even objects to calling what his
company creates a ``magazine.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We view what we're doing as much more engaging than
television, and the term `magazine' implies something text-based on
paper,'' Goldberg said. ``It's rich media content and advertising
delivered to your computer. We deliver this content over a whole
bunch of different platforms.''
</P>
<P>
   The company has 300,000 regular subscribers for its CD-ROM-based
publication, which can be purchased at newsstands and bookstores
all over. At the same time, the company is busily testing its
future in a variety of other media, said Goldberg.
</P>
<P>
   This week in Fremont, for instance, a few hundred subscribers of
the broadband cable service Home will be the first guinea pigs for
Launch's interactive television offerings, Goldberg said. By early
next year, 500,000 subscribers on about 1,000 cable systems around
the country will be getting Launch's interactive interviews, games,
reviews and other material directly in their homes, Goldberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Because the new service is just starting up and has virtually no
predecessors as models, Goldberg is vague about how it will look
and what it will offer by the time it goes public.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of stuff (on the CD-ROM version of Launch), but
we want to do a lot more,'' Goldberg said. ``We don't know how it's
going to go.''
</P>
<P>
   For instance, with the most recent CD-ROM issue's cover girl,
singer Sheryl Crow, ``She did three live acoustic songs and two
hours of interviews, but we only used five minutes of the interview
and one song,'' Goldberg said. ``We'd like to use more of that. So
some of (what we'll be doing) is not additional production costs,
just being more in-depth with the stuff we do have.''
</P>
<P>
   The company also is doing what Goldberg called a ``soft
relaunch'' this week of its music-oriented Web site myLaunch (at
www.mylaunch.com) with a substantial redesign to make it easier to
navigate.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime early next year, a DVD-based Launch will be available,
with more information than CD-ROM allows, Goldberg said. But
eventually, Goldberg said, his company's future doesn't lie on a
silvery platter.
</P>
<P>
   ``CD-ROM was the first delivery platform we could use to deliver
our content,'' Goldberg said. ``But eventually we will have no
CD-ROM or DVD-ROM, we'll be just delivering over broadband access.
My guess is within two years.'' By then, there should be enough
homes with broadband connections that Launch can make a go of it
financially without the headaches of pressing and delivering
hundreds of thousands of discs every few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a little busy right now,'' Goldberg said. ``And you're
gonna hear about some more stuff in the next few weeks.''

CASE OF `DIANA' DEJA VU
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEITH MARDER 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Hey, how's this for a novel idea? NBC is going to
air a loving tribute to Princess Diana on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, you've seen one before?
</P>
<P>
   But, hey, that was Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Diana,'' a two-hour documentary, will air at 8 p.m. to
commemorate the first anniversary of Diana's death.
</P>
<P>
   The network went to the big guns to put this together. Emmy
Award-winner Robert Halmi Sr. is the executive producer, and
Academy Award-winning filmmaker Lord Richard Attenborough narrates.
</P>
<P>
   Attenborough, who was a close friend of Diana's, makes it clear
at the outset that this is not a tawdry tale that dredges up the
sensational events of her very public adult life.
</P>
<P>
   Attenborough was brought into the fold by the royal family to
help a shy princess with her public speaking. So his part was done
from a place of respect, admiration and love. His insight is
apparent, and his style of narration is conversational, making the
two hours a comfortable ride.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the people talking are friends, including Lucia Flecha
de Lima, Mary Robertson (Diana was her child's nanny), plus Diana's
nanny and Diana's friend Lana Marks. We also hear from her
hairstylist, makeup artist (who tries all too hard to sound like a
confidante), her acupuncturist and her astrologer.
</P>
<P>
   Sure these people had some interesting access, but it shows how
documenting ``Diana'' has been overdone. How far down the line can
they go?
</P>
<P>
   Who will be interviewed for the next documentary, someone who
watched this documentary?
</P>
<P>
   The beginning of the show is the most interesting, where we get
to learn about Diana as a child and what influenced and motivated
her to be the person she became. We hear from teachers and school
administrators.
</P>
<P>
   The story, told in chronological order, bogs down as it goes on.
This is mainly because Diana's charitable work in foreign countries
and with AIDs patients already is so well-known.
</P>
<P>
   People she has helped speak up, but it's too redundant and
seemed too packaged.
</P>
<P>
   This is a classy piece of work about a woman who nearly always
conducted herself with dignity and compassion. It's crisply edited
and nice to look at. But it is a clearly exhausted subject.
Television was jammed with coverage at the time of her tragic
death, and now, one year later, Round 2 continues with repeats and
new stories, but no new information.

importance of Japan, along with its misery: When trading ended

Russian economy at present exchange rates. In other words, in one
glum week's work, Japan managed the financial equivalent of wiping
Russia off the world map. Japan is so monumental as to be central
to the health of the global economy, but for now it remains a mess,
albeit an impressively large one. A month after Prime Minister

ASSAULT RIFLE BAN FACES VETO IN CALIFORNIA
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT SALLADAY  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ California Gov. Pete Wilson has vowed to veto a
bill approved this week by the state Assembly that would be the
toughest assault weapons ban in the country.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the governor said the measure goes too far and
invites lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   If Wilson rejects the bill, California will be left without an
effective assault weapons ban, because a state law passed in 1989
in the wake of a schoolyard massacre in Stockton has been
emasculated by the courts.
</P>
<P>
   On its third attempt in the lower house, a measure by Democratic
Assemblyman Don Perata of Oakland passed Thursday by a 41-31 vote.
</P>
<P>
   The measure would expand the list of banned weapons, put
first-ever restrictions on large magazine clips and increase the
penalties for using high-powered weapons when committing a felony.
</P>
<P>
   Also Thursday, the legislature approved a measure that would put
consumer protections on junk guns, or ``Saturday night specials.''
Under the bill, all handguns manufactured in California must meet
drop-safety and firing-safety tests. Wilson is expected to veto
that measure as well.
</P>
<P>
   Despite word from Wilson spokesman Ron Low that the Perata bill
was unacceptable, the assemblyman said he hoped the public would
call or write Wilson and encourage him to sign his bill.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican governor, who is considering a run for president
in 2000, has 30 days to decide. Since the legislature ends its
two-year session at midnight Monday, Perata said that if Wilson
``doesn't sign it, California basically has no assault weapon
ban.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``I think what happens is some wacko walks out there
on Oct. 5 and opens up on some schoolyard or factory, and that's
going to be Pete's legacy.''
</P>
<P>
   But Low said the Wilson administration had tried over several
months to reduce the number of banned guns. Specifically, Wilson
wanted to allow weapons with up to a 20-round capacity, instead of
the 19 rounds Perata wrote into the measure.
</P>
<P>
   The distinction is important because many high-powered weapons,
such at the M-16 made mostly during the Vietnam War, use 20-round
magazines. Perata said those weapons were for military use and had
no business on the street.
</P>
<P>
   Low said Perata had changed the definition of an assault weapon
14 times and ended up with a measure that would prompt a flood of
lawsuits in order to determine the law's meaning.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it comes down in current form, the administration cannot
support this bill,'' Low said. ``There were a number of definitions
to expand the guns covered under the assault weapons ban, and the
more definitions that were added, the more confusing it got, and
the more chances there would be challenges to the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the veto threat, Luis Tolley, the western director for
Handgun Control Inc., called Thursday's vote a ``tremendous victory
for public safety.''
</P>
<P>
   Tolley said Perata's measure addressed a number of the
governor's concerns: It would postpone enactment until 2000 to give
owners time to comply, boost penalties to add as much as 10 more
years in prison for using high-powered weapons to commit a felony,
and would expand rather than replace the 1959 law.
</P>
<P>
   The National Rifle Association and most Assembly Republicans
called Perata's measure vague and said it would lead to more
confusion about what constitutes an assault weapon.

<P>
   MINSK, Belarus _ The Soviet Union has collapsed and the Moscow
nights swing nowadays, but back here in Minsk old communist-style
think is still the norm.
</P>
<P>
   Take the case of ``Pinocchio.'' The Belorussian version of the
traditional puppet show for children was yanked off the Minsk stage
not long ago when critics saw too many allusions to the current
nasty political scene in the play.
</P>
<P>
   How could a mere children's show cause so much offense in this
dictator-run land? That's easy. To begin with, Ales Surau, the set
designer, dressed the wooden ``actors'' in contemporary quilted
jackets, Russian workers' caps and workers' rubber boots.
</P>
<P>
   That act alone aroused the ire of the nation's critics. ``The
peasants look like criminals. I was at a collective farm not long
ago and I saw people there who were very well-dressed,'' one them
complained.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pinocchio,'' or ``Lipawiczki,'' as the Belorussian version is
known, had been a big hit when it played earlier this year at the
Puppet Theater in Grodno, a provincial center that's a lot less
uptight than this rigid capital -- which is under the all-watchful
eye of Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko.
</P>
<P>
   But when the play was shifted from Grodno to the Creative
Laboratory in the Puppet Theater here, located across from the
residence of the president, nothing apparently went right.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole circle of critics came to see it,'' Surau, the
designer, recalled. ``But when they gathered there, they went into
shock. What had made people laugh in Grodno caused fear in the
capital.''
</P>
<P>
   As a backdrop for the puppets, Surau designed a three-foot
garland that bore a striking resemblance to the new Belorussian
national emblem -- a Lukashenko creation that the president had
made to replace the historical version.
</P>
<P>
   Surau added what he called ``a creative modification'' to the
new post-Soviet emblem. His garland consisted of fake bananas,
coconuts, pineapples and green tomatoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to stress the idyllic character and agricultural
significance of the performance,'' Surau said with a straight face.
</P>
<P>
   To further his rather mild anti-government parody, in the center
of the garland he placed a globe. And in the center of the globe he
painted a tractor, built by the state tractor factory and known as
``The Belorussia.''
</P>
<P>
   The tractor occupied the exact spot on the map where Minsk
should have been. And on the left side of the map was another
perceived slight: a small Catholic Church in the place of his home
town of Grodno.
</P>
<P>
   To add to the insults against the official line, the walls of
the stage were covered with the presidential newspaper ``Sovietska
Belarus,'' instead of ordinary wallpaper. And in the ``windows''
there were border posts, painted in red and green stripes, where
the actual action of the play took place.
</P>
<P>
   The performance consisted of two plots -- a play within a play.
</P>
<P>
   One plot line followed the traditional battle between good and
evil, as the wooden boy brought joy to the hearts of his father and
fought off evil in the form devilish cats. The other plot focused
on the life of a present-day Belorussian family who had lived for
70 years on a collective farm.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the wall of the peasant hut hung a very simple radio,''
Surau said, one which could tune in only one station.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the basic object of equipment in every village home,''
he pointedly noted. ``A few times during the play the national
anthem resounded from the radio. This same one which awakens people
every day at six in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``The critics were indignant that we had insulted the national
anthem. But it was really they who actually insulted it because
when they watched the performance, they never once stood up. When I
reminded them of this, they began to shout: 'You can't order us
when to stand up.'''
</P>
<P>
   The loyal critics also went ballistic over another scene that
they thought insulted Lukashenko. It depicted a peasant on the
collective farm reading the ``Sovietska Belarus'' newspaper and
thinking out loud, ``Who is the most beautiful person in our
country?'' and answering ``It's well known who.''
</P>
<P>
   After the critics complained, officials ordered the play off the
stage, supposedly to be ``polished up.'' Although the Minsk
audiences, minus the critics, loved it, the play has yet to be
revived.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult to say whether we were dealing with critics or
censors, the outspoken Surau said. ``I guess they were critics who,
out of fear, took on the role of censors.''

<P>
   KINGSTON, Jamaica _ For years, hawkers, panhandlers, drug
dealers, and prostitutes have been as much a part of the landscape
of this Caribbean island as coconut groves and jerk chicken.
</P>
<P>
   But recently, a chorus of complaints from visitors has become so
deafening it's threatened to destroy the foundation on which
Jamaica's economy is built: tourism.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Jamaica Chamber of Commerce has come up with a
controversial solution to alleviate at least part of the problem:
legalize brothels so that red-light districts can be created.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least we'd get the prostitutes off the streets,'' reasoned
Howard Hamilton, chamber president.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a problem here and I don't think we should hide our
heads in the sand,'' he said. ``I'm not advocating prostitution,
but it's out there and we should regulate it.''
</P>
<P>
   Tourism is by far Jamaica's most valuable industry, accounting
for 45 percent of its foreign exchange, for 13.7 percent of its
$6.2 billion gross domestic product (GDP), and for one in every
four jobs.
</P>
<P>
   This island of 2.5 million people welcomed 1.9 million visitors
last year, including 700,000 cruise ship passengers. About 60
percent came from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But harassment by overzealous prostitutes, drug dealers, taxi
drivers, hair braiders and curio vendors has taken its toll in a
country that has been hit hard over the last few years by the North
American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) -- losing dozens of foreign
businesses to lowered trade barriers between Canada, Mexico, and
the United States. After shrinking in both 1996 and 1997, Jamaica's
GDP is expected to do the same this year.
</P>
<P>
   And that's why the stakes are so high for this country so bent
on protecting the new mainstay of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   While the number of tourists who visit other Caribbean countries
is expected to jump by a whopping 7 percent this year, the number
who visit Jamaica is expected to climb by a mere 1-to-2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, we had three cruise ships come in here a week, but
this year we only have one a week,'' said Rijhu Jagwani, owner of
the Glad Rags store in Montego Bay. ``There's no question that
harassment has driven some tourists away, and this is hurting
everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, persistent heckling threatens to ``kill the goose that
lays the golden egg,'' warned Prime Minister P.J. Patterson.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are going to refuse to come to Jamaica because of
harassment, resulting in a virtual collapse of the tourism industry
so that there'll be no jobs for anyone at all,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Holland America and Celebrity cruise lines have pulled
out of Montego Bay, partly because travelers were reporting
discomfort during their stops there.
</P>
<P>
   According to a survey by the Jamaica Tourist Board, 56 percent
of visitors to Jamaica last year said they'd been harassed at some
point during their stays. Of that number, 60 percent had been asked
to buy drugs and 13 percent said the incidents had spoiled their
trip.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson has so far not commented on Hamilton's proposal.
</P>
<P>
   But Patterson has initiated a government crackdown on
harassment.
</P>
<P>
   Signs have gone up alongside many highways directed at Jamaicans
that say: ``Tourism Is Everyone's Business.''
</P>
<P>
   In June, the penalties for first-time offenders who bother
tourists to buy or barter for drugs, sex and souvenirs were raised
100-fold, from $27 to $2,700. The penalties for repeat offenders
were increased from $41 to $4,100.
</P>
<P>
   Night courts were established so that law-enforcement officers
can appear in court without having to abandon their beats.
</P>
<P>
   But while big fines might deter those with a legitimate business
who have a lot to lose, it's not clear how they will affect the
marginal players, the unemployed people trying to eke out a living
with few options to choose from.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel McCook, a spokesman for the Jamaica Tourist Board,
concedes that it's not easy to haul violators before the courts on
charges of harassment or solicitation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such a sensitive issue because on one hand you want to
encourage visitors to interact with average Jamaicans so that they
learn about the culture, but on the other hand you don't want
visitors to feel uncomfortable,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At least with red-light districts, Hamilton contends,
streetwalking prostitutes wouldn't be a bother.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton's proposed that the government require medical
certification for the brothels and regular testing of the
prostitutes for sexually transmitted diseases.
</P>
<P>
   He said the districts could be modeled after the aptly named
Campo Alegre, or Camp of Happiness -- the government-operated
red-light district in Curacao.
</P>
<P>
   As a Dutch possession, prostitution is legal on that island and
is regulated by the government.
</P>
<P>
   Located on a hill near the airport, Campo Alegre resembles a
prison camp, and is guarded by policemen.
</P>
<P>
   The Jamaica Council of Churches has blasted Hamilton's proposal,
issuing a statement that instructs chamber members to ask
themselves whether they would recommend prostitution for their own
sons and daughters.
</P>
<P>
   But Hamilton argues that with unemployment already nearing 20
percent, drastic action is needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got an economic situation in this country where people
are desperate to find jobs so of course they flock to the tourist
areas because it's the only place they can make money, but they're
scaring away the tourists,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Making people even more desperate is the rising popularity of
all-inclusive resorts. Tourists tend to tether themselves there and
not make themselves available to the hawkers and small business
owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``People offering things are more assertive now,'' McCook said.
``The manner of selling has gotten more offensive.''

   MINSK, Belarus _ The Soviet Union has collapsed and the Moscow
nights swing nowadays, but back here in Minsk old communist-style
think is still the norm.
</P>
<P>
   Take the case of ``Pinocchio.'' The Belorussian version of the
traditional puppet show for children was yanked off the Minsk stage
not long ago when critics saw too many allusions to the current
nasty political scene in the play.
</P>
<P>
   How could a mere children's show cause so much offense in this
dictator-run land? That's easy. To begin with, Ales Surau, the set
designer, dressed the wooden ``actors'' in contemporary quilted
jackets, Russian workers' caps and workers' rubber boots.
</P>
<P>
   That act alone aroused the ire of the nation's critics. ``The
peasants look like criminals. I was at a collective farm not long
ago and I saw people there who were very well-dressed,'' one them
complained.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pinocchio,'' or ``Lipawiczki,'' as the Belorussian version is
known, had been a big hit when it played earlier this year at the
Puppet Theater in Grodno, a provincial center that's a lot less
uptight than this rigid capital -- which is under the all-watchful
eye of Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko.
</P>
<P>
   But when the play was shifted from Grodno to the Creative
Laboratory in the Puppet Theater here, located across from the
residence of the president, nothing apparently went right.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole circle of critics came to see it,'' Surau, the
designer, recalled. ``But when they gathered there, they went into
shock. What had made people laugh in Grodno caused fear in the
capital.''
</P>
<P>
   As a backdrop for the puppets, Surau designed a three-foot
garland that bore a striking resemblance to the new Belorussian
national emblem -- a Lukashenko creation that the president had
made to replace the historical version.
</P>
<P>
   Surau added what he called ``a creative modification'' to the
new post-Soviet emblem. His garland consisted of fake bananas,
coconuts, pineapples and green tomatoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to stress the idyllic character and agricultural
significance of the performance,'' Surau said with a straight face.
</P>
<P>
   To further his rather mild anti-government parody, in the center
of the garland he placed a globe. And in the center of the globe he
painted a tractor, built by the state tractor factory and known as
``The Belorussia.''
</P>
<P>
   The tractor occupied the exact spot on the map where Minsk
should have been. And on the left side of the map was another
perceived slight: a small Catholic Church in the place of his home
town of Grodno.
</P>
<P>
   To add to the insults against the official line, the walls of
the stage were covered with the presidential newspaper ``Sovietska
Belarus,'' instead of ordinary wallpaper. And in the ``windows''
there were border posts, painted in red and green stripes, where
the actual action of the play took place.
</P>
<P>
   The performance consisted of two plots -- a play within a play.
</P>
<P>
   One plot line followed the traditional battle between good and
evil, as the wooden boy brought joy to the hearts of his father and
fought off evil in the form devilish cats. The other plot focused
on the life of a present-day Belorussian family who had lived for
70 years on a collective farm.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the wall of the peasant hut hung a very simple radio,''
Surau said, one which could tune in only one station.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the basic object of equipment in every village home,''
he pointedly noted. ``A few times during the play the national
anthem resounded from the radio. This same one which awakens people
every day at six in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``The critics were indignant that we had insulted the national
anthem. But it was really they who actually insulted it because
when they watched the performance, they never once stood up. When I
reminded them of this, they began to shout: 'You can't order us
when to stand up.'''
</P>
<P>
   The loyal critics also went ballistic over another scene that
they thought insulted Lukashenko. It depicted a peasant on the
collective farm reading the ``Sovietska Belarus'' newspaper and
thinking out loud, ``Who is the most beautiful person in our
country?'' and answering ``It's well known who.''
</P>
<P>
   After the critics complained, officials ordered the play off the
stage, supposedly to be ``polished up.'' Although the Minsk
audiences, minus the critics, loved it, the play has yet to be
revived.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult to say whether we were dealing with critics or
censors, the outspoken Surau said. ``I guess they were critics who,
out of fear, took on the role of censors.''

<P>
   KINGSTON, Jamaica _ For years, hawkers, panhandlers, drug
dealers, and prostitutes have been as much a part of the landscape
of this Caribbean island as coconut groves and jerk chicken.
</P>
<P>
   But recently, a chorus of complaints from visitors has become so
deafening it's threatened to destroy the foundation on which
Jamaica's economy is built: tourism.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Jamaica Chamber of Commerce has come up with a
controversial solution to alleviate at least part of the problem:
legalize brothels so that red-light districts can be created.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least we'd get the prostitutes off the streets,'' reasoned
Howard Hamilton, chamber president.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a problem here and I don't think we should hide our
heads in the sand,'' he said. ``I'm not advocating prostitution,
but it's out there and we should regulate it.''
</P>
<P>
   Tourism is by far Jamaica's most valuable industry, accounting
for 45 percent of its foreign exchange, for 13.7 percent of its
$6.2 billion gross domestic product (GDP), and for one in every
four jobs.
</P>
<P>
   This island of 2.5 million people welcomed 1.9 million visitors
last year, including 700,000 cruise ship passengers. About 60
percent came from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But harassment by overzealous prostitutes, drug dealers, taxi
drivers, hair braiders and curio vendors has taken its toll in a
country that has been hit hard over the last few years by the North
American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) -- losing dozens of foreign
businesses to lowered trade barriers between Canada, Mexico, and
the United States. After shrinking in both 1996 and 1997, Jamaica's
GDP is expected to do the same this year.
</P>
<P>
   And that's why the stakes are so high for this country so bent
on protecting the new mainstay of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   While the number of tourists who visit other Caribbean countries
is expected to jump by a whopping 7 percent this year, the number
who visit Jamaica is expected to climb by a mere 1-to-2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, we had three cruise ships come in here a week, but
this year we only have one a week,'' said Rijhu Jagwani, owner of
the Glad Rags store in Montego Bay. ``There's no question that
harassment has driven some tourists away, and this is hurting
everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, persistent heckling threatens to ``kill the goose that
lays the golden egg,'' warned Prime Minister P.J. Patterson.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are going to refuse to come to Jamaica because of
harassment, resulting in a virtual collapse of the tourism industry
so that there'll be no jobs for anyone at all,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Holland America and Celebrity cruise lines have pulled
out of Montego Bay, partly because travelers were reporting
discomfort during their stops there.
</P>
<P>
   According to a survey by the Jamaica Tourist Board, 56 percent
of visitors to Jamaica last year said they'd been harassed at some
point during their stays. Of that number, 60 percent had been asked
to buy drugs and 13 percent said the incidents had spoiled their
trip.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson has so far not commented on Hamilton's proposal.
</P>
<P>
   But Patterson has initiated a government crackdown on
harassment.
</P>
<P>
   Signs have gone up alongside many highways directed at Jamaicans
that say: ``Tourism Is Everyone's Business.''
</P>
<P>
   In June, the penalties for first-time offenders who bother
tourists to buy or barter for drugs, sex and souvenirs were raised
100-fold, from $27 to $2,700. The penalties for repeat offenders
were increased from $41 to $4,100.
</P>
<P>
   Night courts were established so that law-enforcement officers
can appear in court without having to abandon their beats.
</P>
<P>
   But while big fines might deter those with a legitimate business
who have a lot to lose, it's not clear how they will affect the
marginal players, the unemployed people trying to eke out a living
with few options to choose from.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel McCook, a spokesman for the Jamaica Tourist Board,
concedes that it's not easy to haul violators before the courts on
charges of harassment or solicitation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such a sensitive issue because on one hand you want to
encourage visitors to interact with average Jamaicans so that they
learn about the culture, but on the other hand you don't want
visitors to feel uncomfortable,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At least with red-light districts, Hamilton contends,
streetwalking prostitutes wouldn't be a bother.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton's proposed that the government require medical
certification for the brothels and regular testing of the
prostitutes for sexually transmitted diseases.
</P>
<P>
   He said the districts could be modeled after the aptly named
Campo Alegre, or Camp of Happiness -- the government-operated
red-light district in Curacao.
</P>
<P>
   As a Dutch possession, prostitution is legal on that island and
is regulated by the government.
</P>
<P>
   Located on a hill near the airport, Campo Alegre resembles a
prison camp, and is guarded by policemen.
</P>
<P>
   The Jamaica Council of Churches has blasted Hamilton's proposal,
issuing a statement that instructs chamber members to ask
themselves whether they would recommend prostitution for their own
sons and daughters.
</P>
<P>
   But Hamilton argues that with unemployment already nearing 20
percent, drastic action is needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got an economic situation in this country where people
are desperate to find jobs so of course they flock to the tourist
areas because it's the only place they can make money, but they're
scaring away the tourists,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Making people even more desperate is the rising popularity of
all-inclusive resorts. Tourists tend to tether themselves there and
not make themselves available to the hawkers and small business
owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``People offering things are more assertive now,'' McCook said.
``The manner of selling has gotten more offensive.''

CALIF. JUDGE HANDS DOWN RULING FAVORABLE TO BILINGUAL EDUCATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT SELNA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND _ Supporters of bilingual education won a victory this
week when a judge ordered the state Board of Education to consider
allowing school districts to keep bilingual programs despite voter
approval in June of the anti-bilingual Proposition 227.
</P>
<P>
   Alameda County Superior Court Judge Henry Needham refused
Thursday to block local enforcement of Prop. 227, which requires
districts to replace bilingual education with ``English
immersion.''
</P>
<P>
   But he ruled that the California Board of Education must
consider a school district's request for a waiver, which would let
it keep its entire bilingual program.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling pleased backers of bilingual education.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are extremely pleased because this maintains flexibility
and discretion at the local level,'' said William Quinn Jr., an
attorney for the Berkeley, Hayward and Oakland school districts,
which sued the Department of Education and state schools chief
Delaine Eastin.
</P>
<P>
   The local districts filed suit after the Board of Education
refused to consider waivers earlier this summer, contending it had
no authority to grant them for entire school districts. The board
was advised by the office of the state legislative counsel and
their staff attorneys that they could not legally consider the
waivers.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Unz, a Silicon Valley software developer who chaired the
Prop. 227 campaign, said he was miffed by Needham's ruling and
believed it violated the state constitution.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it is completely incorrect,'' Unz said. ``The (state)
constitution says that an initiative voted in by the people can
only be amended by the people or the legislature and not by an
elected board.''
</P>
<P>
   Unz said lawyers who had helped put together the proposition
would work on an appeal immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Local school district leaders had a different reaction to the
judge's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it's a good decision,'' said Joe Symkowick, the San
Francisco School District's legal counsel. ``We don't think it
could have gone any other way.''
</P>
<P>
   Symkowick said he believed Needham's decision would stand
because the California education code allowed waivers for any
provision in the code, including Prop. 227, unless otherwise
stated.
</P>
<P>
   But Deputy Attorney General Angela Botelho, who represented the
state board in court, noted that Prop. 227 contained declarations
that bilingual education was harmful to students and that English
immersion was helpful. The board might rely on those statements to
deny any waivers, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The board will probably decide whether to appeal the ruling at
its next meeting, Sept. 9-11 in Sacramento, said board attorney Rae
Belisle.
</P>
<P>
   Prop. 227, approved by 61 percent of the voters, has been upheld
by federal courts and takes effect with the new school term,
already under way in some parts of California.

A CANDIDATE FEELS A DOWNWARD PULL FROM CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARTIN F. NOLAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OLYMPIA, Wash. -- Perhaps because he is a clinical psychologist
or perhaps because he is the type of enthusiastic congressional
aspirant either party would like to recruit, the candidate is
compellingly candid. ``Three weeks ago,'' Brian Baird says,
``people were saying about the president, `Get off his back.' Now
there's a profound sense of disappointment. If you try to defend
the president, you run into questions like `Isn't character
important?' Character is tremendously important, and that's where
the president let us down. It's sad.''
</P>
<P>
   Baird, a Democrat, is on a bus, zooming along I-5, pointing out
Mount Rainier and Mount St. Helens to Dick Gephardt, telling the
House minority leader that the Columbia River needs dredging. In
1996, Baird lost to Republican Representative Linda Smith by 887
votes. She opted to seek a US Senate seat and Baird, running
nonstop for three years, seems stronger than any of the four
Republicans in the Sept. 15 primary for the 3d Congressional
District in southwestern Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Yet a specter from what folks here call ``the other Washington''
clouds his optimism. ``You try to organize, get every voter out,
and something happens,'' he says. In 1996, Bill Clinton carried
this district with 49 percent, the same as his nationwide total.
Baird wants to discuss Social Security, education, and health care,
but confronts voter discontent with Clinton, which mushroomed after
the president's televised address Aug. 17.
</P>
<P>
   ``As frustrated as people are, they do want to put it behind
us,'' Baird says. In his psychology classes at Pacific Lutheran
University, ``I teach responsibility,'' he says. He fingers
Clinton, not Kenneth Starr, as the distraction to his campaign:
``It's his fault that people are talking about it.''
</P>
<P>
   For Gephardt, distractions usually are speed bumps on his
disciplined, on-message salesman's mission. He has spent a Willy
Loman week, out there with a shoeshine and a smile among places
like Scranton, Bloomington, Dubuque, Janesville, and Olympia,
trying to win back the House for the Democrats. But he, too, faces
the reality of impeachment and doesn't shy from the subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``We shouldn't jump to conclusions,'' he says at every stop.
``We don't know what the report from Ken Starr will say or even if
there will be a report. I hope there's nothing in it. But whatever
happens, we will deal with it in an objective, fair, and just
manner. This must not be a partisan street brawl.''
</P>
<P>
   This wait-and-see attitude is shared by the man Gephardt wants
to replace, Speaker Gingrich. In the deepest recesses of their wish
list, neither Gephardt nor Gingrich wants a premature inauguration
of President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt's reputation for rectitude is such that he sounds
risque when he says, ``You might say I have gavel envy.'' He calls
Clinton's conduct ``reprehensible,'' enunciating each syllable.
This does not please the White House, but does serve as an
etiquette tip to House candidates in close contests on how to
distance themselves discreetly from Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Avoiding ``a partisan street brawl'' is both statesmanlike and
practical. Such a squabble could depress turnout, a grim prospect
for Gephardt and for candidates like Brian Baird. Asked if he has
met any voters who say they're so disgusted they just won't vote,
he candidly says ``Yes, about one percent, I'd say.'' Baird also
notes that in 1996, he lost by three-eighths of one percent. The
numbers for Gephardt are sobering. Republicans hold an edge of 11
seats in today's House. ``We expect to pick up five or six seats,''
he says. But with some expected losses of current Democratic seats,
he really needs about 16 victories.
</P>
<P>
   Like another notable redhead from St. Louis, Mark McGwire,
Gephardt is battling history. Hitting 62 home runs may be easier
than winning an off-year victory for a party headed by a president
with a muted message and tattered coattails.

   Your next car is being designed by mathematicians _ number
crunchers who spend long hours bending things, inventing computer
models, and wade gleefully through miles of printouts to perfect
the widgets and whatsits that go into a modern car. To me, at
least, there is some fun in this boring work; the lab has moved
onto the track.
</P>
<P>
   I spent a fruitful afternoon at Ford's Technical Center in
Dearborn, Mich., last week watching the crunchers crunch and
participating in some on-the-track testing exercises. The
demonstration pitted a new Mercury Cougar against a Mitsubishi
Eclipse in the Lommel Lane Change, an exercise named for Ford's
test center in Belgium. Both cars are wired, instrumented, and
equipped with a high-tech addition to the steering wheel to measure
driver input precisely.
</P>
<P>
   Lasers mounted on the car establish a reference plane parallel
with the driving surface, and computers record every deviation,
every twitch of the chassis. At 40 miles per hour through the
course, my seat-of-the-pants sense was that the Cougar was flatter
through the hard turns, exhibited less body roll, and, therefore,
could make it through the course somewhat faster than the Eclipse.
</P>
<P>
   The generous array of computer printouts and graphs depicting my
runs through the course verified that my seat-of-the-pants sense
was on target that day _ measurements don't lie.
</P>
<P>
   And then it occurred to me _ just who or what is being tested
here? Were the media reps participating being evaluated to to
establish a baseline against which to judge their car reviews?
Instead of merely saying that so-and-so doesn't know what he is
talking about, will Ford have a data base to prove it?
</P>
<P>
   The engineers I dumped this on looked at first shocked, then
amused _ apparently they hadn't thought of that yet. But then,
journalists naturally seem to have a conspiratorial bent in their
thinking. And now that we've brought it up ....
</P>
<P>
   Your columnist will delve deeper into the complexity of car
design in future episodes of Automobilia; knowing what the
engineers can achieve should give the consumer some insight into
what he/she should be looking to find in a car.

   There are giants among us whose labors go largely unnoticed in
the clamor of everyday life _ until suddenly they are no longer
there. Such was Carl S. Amsley, 77, of St. Thomas, Pa., who died in
his sleep a week ago today.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Amsley? Not exactly a household word in the automotive
world but something of a legend in the steam automobile fraternity,
a virtual deity among owners of Stanley Steamers _ Amsley bought,
sold, owned, repaired, or rebuilt more Stanleys than any other man
perhaps since the Stanley twins packed in the business in the
1920s, but at least since Fred Marriott closed his shop in the
'50s.
</P>
<P>
   Amsley was one of the few keepers of the steam automotive flame
in a world focused on V-8s. In the words of Susan S. Davis,
director of the Stanley Museum, ``When steam technology and
Stanleys were falling through the cracks, Amsley was guarding those
cracks.''
</P>
<P>
   I first met Amsley in 1984 on a trip to Kingfield, Maine, to
find out what was up with a fledgling Stanley Museum and see what
steam cars were all about. Amsley was standing in the doorway of a
barn on Stanley Avenue, taking shelter from a shower, beer in hand,
a broad smile on his face as he whipped out a business card
proclaiming ``Stanley Sales &AMP; Service.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the only Stanley dealer still in business,'' he announced.
And he never did stop selling Stanleys _ the car, the idea, the
legend.
</P>
<P>
   ``You ever ridden in a Stanley?'' he finally asked me, and, upon
getting a negative reply, led me to a car sitting in the museum
parking lot, an early ``coffin nose'' with a mother-in-law seat
behind the driver and passenger seats. The car smelled of burning
oil, diffusing heat, hissing oh so slightly as it stood ready, its
pilot light maintaining steam pressure in the boiler. We climbed
aboard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hold this,'' he said as he thrust the still full bottle into
my hand, opened the throttle, and sent the car chuffing through the
streets of Kingfield. As Amsley warmed to his task, the steamer
picked up real speed, a somewhat scary experience for the
uninitiated clinging to a seat sans seatbelt, perched high off the
street in this open antique.
</P>
<P>
   ``Watch this,'' said Amsley, beaming, as he missed a station
wagon by about a coat of paint and sent the Stanley sliding across
the museum parking lot up on two wheels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, what do you think about Stanleys now?'' he asked. I
countered with a question.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you always drive your car like that?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hell no,'' he roared back. ``This ain't my car.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, it wasn't, not that day, anyway. But if he hadn't owned it
at some time, you can bet he had worked on it. A contractor by
trade, Amsley began an affair with steam in the 1950s when steamers
were a drag on the market, mostly junkers for sale cheap. Amsley
traded, bought, sold, learned, built, proselytized, taught steam
and steamers. He invented a new class of car, the ``sweepings,'' a
car assembled from random collections of Stanley parts with a few
new pieces thrown in.
</P>
<P>
   Amsley became the source, the resident expert, and butt of many
a joke _ he was frequently credited with keeping 500 of the 400 or
so remaining Stanleys running, a reference to his building cars
from odd parts.
</P>
<P>
   But, that's exactly why he was important; he kept Stanleys
running. Amsley was a force for the automotive hobby. If some of
his cars can be criticized in the light of current-day restoration
and provenance standards, there is still ample cause to praise him
for keeping them in existence and plenty of reason to praise his
craftsmanship. When few people cared about steam, Amsley was the
person to whom those few turned for parts, cars, service, help, and
enthusiastic encouragement.
</P>
<P>
   The Stanley Museum has become the center of focus for the steam
hobby, a clearinghouse for those seeking expertise, cars, parts, or
just information. Interest in steam and Stanleys has grown
exponentially in the last 10 years. Amsley was a charter member and
enthusiastic supporter of the museum. Several who knew him have
established a memorial fund in his name at the museum _ you can
write to the Stanley Museum, Box 280, Kingfield, ME 04947 or
telephone 207-265-2729 for details.
</P>
<P>
   Amsley's middle name wasn't Stanley, but it might as well have
been. He left quite a legacy.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Industry bible Automotive News reports that General Motors is
now pressuring its suppliers for discounts _ in cash. Up front. Is
this the action of a company serious about cutting costs _ or is
this the symptom of a cash-strapped company in dire straits?
</P>
<P>
   The General has also terminated any effort to acquire Kia, the
ailing Korean car company. GM has been courting Korean firms for a
long time, once had a partnership with Daewoo _ remember the
subcompact Tracer? But the talk continues of closing old factories
and building new ones.
</P>
<P>
   So, how much did GM lose in the strike? And just how cash-short
is the General?

THE WEDDING DRESS THAT ATE HOLLYWOOD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday Aug. 30)  
(js) 
 By AMY M. SPINDLER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's the only formal party some people are ever invited to. It's
the only couture dress many women will ever own. It's the only
catered event many people ever attend. There's no mystery to why
people love weddings and are thrilled to sit through them again and
again. And in today's popular culture, geared to pander and give
the people what they want and only what they want, audiences are
getting plenty of opportunity to sit through weddings. Again and
again.
</P>
<P>
   From all the wedding movies, weddings in sitcoms, issues of
magazines devoted to weddings and from the sheer size of the
traditional ``grand finale'' wedding dresses on the runways right
now, it might be reasonable to guess that there are more weddings
than ever. There aren't. Bride's magazine's statistics show that
the number of weddings per year in the United States has hovered
steadily around 2.4 million since the '70s.
</P>
<P>
   What's changed is that now there are ways to measure exactly how
much the country loves weddings, whether it's circulation of
magazines, Nielsen ratings, or box-office receipts. It's been
proven that weddings sell. That's why, after the success of ``Four
Weddings and a Funeral,'' ``My Best Friend's Wedding'' and ``The
Wedding Singer,'' there are dozens of movies with ``wedding'' or
``bride'' in the title in development.
</P>
<P>
   Even fashion seems to be surrendering its former snobbism about
weddings; Vogue came out with its first-ever bridal issue in June.
And instead of the subdued bridal gowns that once closed the runway
shows, designers are sending out enormous made-for-television
bridal dresses. There are weddings during the soap-opera sweeps,
and weddings, or almost weddings, in pilot episodes of every
television show from the new ``Will and Grace'' to ``Friends'' to
``Suddenly Susan'' to ``ER'' And weddings, or weddings canceled by
cold feet, in the last television shows of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the tradition in TV,'' said Garry Marshall, the
former television producer, who directed the movie ``Pretty
Woman.'' ``When your ratings went down, you turned it into a
wedding. We got Fonzie married, we got Richie married, we got Mork
married. We almost got Laverne married. We got Shirley married.
Brides and sweeps weeks go together in TV. When you leave it out,
they ask you about it. I know when I did `Pretty Woman,' a lot of
the comments were: `Why didn't you go one more scene? Why didn't
you have the wedding?' ''
</P>
<P>
   When Marshall reunites Julia Roberts and Richard Gere for
``Runaway Bride,'' to be released next summer, there's not one
wedding, he said, but ``four or five weddings, depending on the
rewrite.'' Ms. Roberts plays a serial jilter, always leaving the
man at the altar; Gere plays a journalist hired to write about her.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Other Sister,'' Marshall's film to be released in March,
starring Diane Keaton and Juliette Lewis, has two weddings in it.
He's also producing a documentary for Showtime, tied in to the
millennium, for May 1999. Directors were asked to expound on a
theme. Barry Levinson (``Wag the Dog'') got the future; Marshall
got weddings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the Wedding Master,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There's competition for that title. ``Polish Wedding,''
``Wedding Band'' and ``My Best Friend's Wedding'' were released
this year. In ``The Wedding Singer,'' Drew Barrymore falls for a
wedding singer. And in ``Picture Perfect,'' Jennifer Aniston falls
for a man who videotapes weddings. Next, there will be ``Cupid's
Love,'' in which Jennifer Love Hewitt plays a wedding planner who
falls for a client.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood is nothing if not efficient at marrying its most
lucrative genres. So there's already a slasher sequel with a bride
and high-school students: ``Bride of Chucky,'' Chucky being the
nasty little killer doll from ``Child's Play.'' In it, Chucky
befriends a bride doll named Tiffany, who goes on a murder spree in
her wedding gown, as they tag along with eloping high-school
students. This movie belongs in the Pandering Pantheon.
</P>
<P>
   And it's not going to end when all the heterosexuals are happily
married off.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many movies in development that cover gay
weddings,'' said Paul Rudnick, who wrote the screenplay for ``In
and Out,'' in which Joan Cusack's character is left at the altar
when Kevin Kline's character comes out. ``Lesbian weddings have the
potential for double the chiffon, and a drag wedding can
extrapolate into infinity,'' Rudnick said.
</P>
<P>
   It may be time to remake ``Seven Brides for Seven Brothers,''
while everyone's in the mood. Seven brides! Seven bridal dresses!
Forty-two bridesmaids! Think of the comedic possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Bride's magazine's February/March issue was some 1,160 pages and
weighed 4.4 pounds, which may have led to Vogue's doing its own
bridal issue in June. ``Certainly the fact we were in the Guinness
Book of World Records and there are so many people interested in
marketing to the bride and groom had an impact,'' said Millie
Martini-Bratten, the magazine's editor. ``We're seeing many more
advertisements with the icon of the bride and groom.'' That
includes television commercials for products not at the top of
anyone's bridal registry, like Pepsi, Tylenol, Met Life, Buick and
Dockers. The magazine's slogan after all is ``Where love meets
money.''
</P>
<P>
   In Style has an annual celebrity wedding issue in February, with
everything you ever wanted to know about events like the Kelsey
Grammer nuptials. ``The funny thing is, as cynical as a marketer
may be, I don't think there's any cynicism on the part of the
consumer,'' said Hal Rubenstein, the fashion editor of In Style.
``The consumer wants this desperately. You can tell it from the
letters; you can tell it from the reader response.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the celebrity weddings themselves have become powerful
marketing tools for the plethora of magazines that now cover the
lives of the stars. Barbra Streisand marries, and People magazine
sells more issues. And when cool young people like Uma Thurman and
Ethan Hawke wed, it changes the reputation of the event itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Uma was eight months' pregnant when I did her dress,'' said
Vera Wang, the designer. ``You can't get much hipper than that.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   She said that young celebrities, whom women throughout the
country copy, want traditional weddings. Like the ones in the
movies. ``I keep expecting the Hollywood weddings to be hipper,
modern and offbeat, and they end up with weddings that are the most
traditional,'' Ms. Wang said. ``I'm doing Posh Spice's wedding
dress, and that's pretty much the height of what's happening right
now among young people. When we came into weddings in the '80s,
weddings were happening, but when people around in the media
thought of weddings, they'd stick their finger down their throat.''
</P>
<P>
   The media, obviously, have gotten over that reflex.
</P>
<P>
   And that's good news for designers. The tradition of closing
each runway show with a wedding dress has been around for years,
but today's dresses have never been rivaled for their size. Yohji
Yamamoto's fall show had perhaps the largest ever; it practically
had to be turned on its side to fit through the door.
</P>
<P>
   ``The runway becomes more exaggerated, and that is the
entertainment value of it all,'' said Richard Martin, the curator
of the Costume Institute at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. ``If
you assume the wedding dress is the symbolic finale, it makes sense
that it's going to be more hyperbolic than ever.''
</P>
<P>
   It is one more sign of how utterly populist runway shows have
become, having to appeal, like movies and television shows, to the
widest audience possible. Maybe it's that today, the only way to
eke an emotion out of an overloaded audience _ whether sitting by a
runway, in front of a television set, in a movie theater or reading
a magazine _ is to throw a bride at it and hope for the best.
</P>
<P>
   Are we all really as simplistic as that? Actually, the better
question might be, ``Are we all as lazy as that?'' Not only are
writers clinging to the possibility of connubial bliss more
fervently than Mickey Rooney and Elizabeth Taylor put together, but
so are their audiences. Are we so lazy that someone must offer us
the quickest shortcut to emotion possible? After all, sending a
model down the runway in an exploded wedding dress, or marrying off
the star of a television show or movie, or putting a bride on a
magazine cover tells us a lot. It tells us about conventionality.
</P>
<P>
   Audiences might eventually get bridal overload. Or perhaps all
1,000 ways to marry that Marshall has found in researching his
documentary might get used up. Fortunately, blockbuster movies,
unlike designers, have other rituals and ceremonies to use, besides
weddings, to gain instant box-office success.
</P>
<P>
   Like funerals. P.J. Hogan, the director of ``Muriel's Wedding''
and ``My Best Friend's Wedding'' (hilarity ensues after a woman
flies in for her best friend's wedding), is moving on to funerals
in his next film, ``Unconditional Love'' (hilarity ensues when a
woman flies in for her idol's funeral).
</P>
<P>
   But how are fashion designers going to find a fresher way to
pander?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe designers can borrow some suggestions from television,
which is much more their medium today than mere fashion is anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Besides weddings, said David Kohan, an executive producer for
``Will and Grace,'' there are the standard heart-tugging plot
points like ``pregnancy, moving to a new place, starting over,
getting a new job, graduating, any big life change.''
</P>
<P>
   But models in caps and gowns probably won't have the same
effect. Too many of them drop out of school.

TEEN SURVIVES RARE BRUSH WITH SHARK 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ When razor-sharp teeth attached to a 2,000-pound
eating machine known as a great white shark rip through your skin,
it's a good idea to fight back. And, hopefully, you'll have a
friend handy to help.
</P>
<P>
   A San Rafael boy learned that lesson firsthand Wednesday
afternoon and is on the road to recovery after fighting off the
ocean's most fearsome predator in an encounter at Stinson Beach,
which is part of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area.
</P>
<P>
   A great white shark attacked Jonathan Kathrein, 16, while he was
awaiting a wave on his boogie board in shallow waters. It was the
first reported shark attack at the popular beach.
</P>
<P>
   Kathrein suffered several piercing wounds to his right thigh. A
foot-long gash stretches from just above his right knee to the
bottom of his buttocks.
</P>
<P>
   Kathrein, who spoke at John Muir Medical Center in Walnut Creek
Thursday, said the ordeal began with a little nudge from a curious
attacker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been hit by jellyfish before, but I knew this was
different,'' he said. ``What hit me was fleshy and was hard like
cartilage. My first thought was that it was a shark.''
</P>
<P>
   Roughly 10 seconds later, the shark bit through his wet suit and
clamped down on his right leg, pulling him off his board and
underwater.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it would take my leg,'' he said. ``Then I thought it
would eat me. I was definitely scared, but I was not hysterical.''
</P>
<P>
   Instinct kicked in, and Kathrein shoved his hands into the
shark's gills until it let go. He then climbed onto his board and
screamed for help until a friend swimming nearby and a lifeguard
came to his rescue.
</P>
<P>
   Examination of Kathrein's wet suit confirmed a great white 6
feet to 8 feet long was the culprit, said Ed Ueber, sanctuary
manager for the Gulf of the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary.
</P>
<P>
   Following the attack, officials with the Golden Gate National
Recreation Area closed Stinson Beach for a week as a precaution.
Lifeguards conducted periodic patrols but did not see any sharks,
said spokeswoman Suzanne Summers. Although two beachgoers reported
possible shark sightings, lifeguards determined the dorsal fins
they saw most likely belonged to porpoises, Summers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important that we monitor shark activity in the area for
everyone's safety,'' Summers said. ``People can still enjoy the
beach.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts who study great white sharks said they were not shocked
by the attack: Stinson Beach is bordered by two rocky areas popular
with seals and sea lions, among sharks' favorite food.
</P>
<P>
   ``The attack doesn't surprise me,'' said John McCosker, resident
shark expert with the California Academy of Sciences in Golden Gate
Park. ``What surprises me is that it hasn't happened sooner.
There's so many people in the water at Stinson Beach.''
</P>
<P>
   And there are well over 100 great whites swimming in the waters
of Northern California during their high season of August through
November looking for food, raising the stakes for some unpleasant
encounters.
</P>
<P>
   Their territory is called the Red Triangle, stretching from
Bodega Bay to the Farallon Islands and down to Santa Cruz, one of
the most densely populated areas in the world for the great white
shark.
</P>
<P>
   Although great white attacks in Northern California seem few and
far between, they occur with some regularity compared to other
parts of the world. A good year for swimmers will see no attacks,
but there have been as many as three in one year and 79 along the
entire California coast since 1950.
</P>
<P>
   Because sharks are so hard to study, experts cannot explain why
the Red Triangle is such a populated territory, although the most
logical reason is the abundant food source, Ueber said.
</P>
<P>
   What's important to understand about shark attacks, experts say,
is that great whites do not care to make dinner out of human flesh.
The sharks, which can reach 20 feet to 30 feet long, typically feed
on blubber-rich seals and sea lions who populate the coastline and
the Farallones, a common breeding ground.
</P>
<P>
   When they do attack humans, they mistake them for a seal or sea
lion and rarely return to feed, even if the victim dies in the
water, Ueber said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even the fattest of humans doesn't compare to a healthy
seal,'' Ueber said. ``We're talking 4 to 5 inches of blubber.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An attack from a great white is swift and painful and usually
occurs in water 20 to 30 feet deep. The shark will typically spot
its prey _ be it marine mammal or human _ floating at the surface
and shoot up toward it in a burst of speed, clamping enormous jaws
around the victim and biting down hard.
</P>
<P>
   Once the shark grabs a victim, it might pull the prey under
water for a few seconds and then let go to avoid the victim's
defense mechanisms. The shark usually hangs around until the victim
bleeds to death and then begins feeding on the carcass.
</P>
<P>
   ``They back off and wait for it to die because they don't want
to encounter this struggling animal,'' McCosker said. ``It's at
risk by trying to consume an angry sea lion.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, said Ueber, if the shark is uncertain of what the
prey is, it may nudge it first, as was reported in Wednesday's
attack.
</P>
<P>
   Sharks usually attack during the daylight because of better
visibility, experts believe, although there is not enough known
about a shark's nighttime patterns to be certain, McCosker said.

came to his rescue.
</P>
<P>
   Examination of Kathrein's wet suit confirmed a great white 6
feet to 8 feet long was the culprit, said Ed Ueber, sanctuary
manager for the Gulf of the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary.
</P>
<P>
   Following the attack, officials with the Golden Gate National
Recreation Area closed Stinson Beach for a week as a precaution.
Lifeguards conducted periodic patrols but did not see any sharks,
said spokeswoman Suzanne Summers. Although two beachgoers reported
possible shark sightings, lifeguards determined the dorsal fins
they saw most likely belonged to porpoises, Summers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important that we monitor shark activity in the area for
everyone's safety,'' Summers said. ``People can still enjoy the
beach.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts who study great white sharks said they were not shocked
by the attack: Stinson Beach is bordered by two rocky areas popular
with seals and sea lions, among sharks' favorite food.
</P>
<P>
   ``The attack doesn't surprise me,'' said John McCosker, resident
shark expert with the California Academy of Sciences in Golden Gate
Park. ``What surprises me is that it hasn't happened sooner.
There's so many people in the water at Stinson Beach.''
</P>
<P>
   And there are well over 100 great whites swimming in the waters
of Northern California during their high season of August through
November looking for food, raising the stakes for some unpleasant
encounters.
</P>
<P>
   Their territory is called the Red Triangle, stretching from
Bodega Bay to the Farallon Islands and down to Santa Cruz, one of
the most densely populated areas in the world for the great white
shark.
</P>
<P>
   Although great white attacks in Northern California seem few and
far between, they occur with some regularity compared to other
parts of the world. A good year for swimmers will see no attacks,
but there have been as many as three in one year and 79 along the
entire California coast since 1950.
</P>
<P>
   Because sharks are so hard to study, experts cannot explain why
the Red Triangle is such a populated territory, although the most
logical reason is the abundant food source, Ueber said.
</P>
<P>
   What's important to understand about shark attacks, experts say,
is that great whites do not care to make dinner out of human flesh.
The sharks, which can reach 20 feet to 30 feet long, typically feed
on blubber-rich seals and sea lions who populate the coastline and
the Farallones, a common breeding ground.
</P>
<P>
   When they do attack humans, they mistake them for a seal or sea
lion and rarely return to feed, even if the victim dies in the
water, Ueber said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even the fattest of humans doesn't compare to a healthy
seal,'' Ueber said. ``We're talking 4 to 5 inches of blubber.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An attack from a great white is swift and painful and usually
occurs in water 20 to 30 feet deep. The shark will typically spot
its prey _ be it marine mammal or human _ floating at the surface
and shoot up toward it in a burst of speed, clamping enormous jaws
around the victim and biting down hard.
</P>
<P>
   Once the shark grabs a victim, it might pull the prey under
water for a few seconds and then let go to avoid the victim's
defense mechanisms. The shark usually hangs around until the victim
bleeds to death and then begins feeding on the carcass.
</P>
<P>
   ``They back off and wait for it to die because they don't want
to encounter this struggling animal,'' McCosker said. ``It's at
risk by trying to consume an angry sea lion.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, said Ueber, if the shark is uncertain of what the
prey is, it may nudge it first, as was reported in Wednesday's
attack.
</P>
<P>
   Sharks usually attack during the daylight because of better
visibility, experts believe, although there is not enough known
about a shark's nighttime patterns to be certain, McCosker said.

   The New York Times plans an extensive package of stories
relating to political and economic turmoil and Russia and its
impact around the world.
</P>
<P>
   These stories are being edited by The Times'  &UR; Foreign Desk &LR; :
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-RDP (Moscow) _ Developments in Moscow, efforts to calm

   MARKET (New York) _ Stocks open higher, flatten out, then move
into negative territory. At 1:15 p.m., the industrial average was
off 52 points and the Nasdaq index was off 395 points. At midday,
the long bond was off 2/32 point, with the yield at 5.35 percent.
By Edward Wyatt.
</P>
<P>
   JAPAN-ECON (Tokyo) _ One statistic stands out to explain the
importance of Japan, along with its misery: When trading ended
Friday in Tokyo, Japanese stocks this week alone had dropped in
value by $241 billion _ a sum that exceeds the size of the entire
Russian economy at present exchange rates. In other words, in one
glum week's work, Japan managed the financial equivalent of wiping
Russia off the world map. Japan is so monumental as to be central
to the health of the global economy, but for now it remains a mess,
albeit an impressively large one. A month after Prime Minister
Keizo Obuchi took office, vowing ``to deal with each issue in a
dramatic, speedy way,'' Japan remains firmly in recession and
largely paralyzed politically and economically. By Nicholas D.
Kristof and Sheryl WuDunn.
</P>
<P>
   HONGKONG-ECON (Hong Kong) _ Hong Kong's financial crisis is
gathering steam. The government on Friday went on the largest
buying spree yet in its two-week-old battle to hurt those betting
against stocks and the local currency. Still, the Hang Seng Index
fell 1.2 percent because the government stood virtually alone in
buying shares during the stock exchange's busiest day ever. By Mark
Landler.

AIRLINE STOCKS: FLYING THROUGH THE TUMULT OF LESS-FRIENDLY SKIES

   (For release Sunday, Aug. 30)

 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a market that until recently was obsessed with corporate
earnings _ and that now seems obsessed with nearly everything _ few
sectors have performed as peculiarly as airline stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Business conditions are extraordinarily good for carriers these
days, yet airline stock prices have been in a tailspin for weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Murphy, an analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, spent
some time late last week, before the outcome of pilot contract
negotiations at Northwest Airlines was known, to sort out the
conundrum.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Isn't it unusual that airline stocks are getting battered?
</P>
<P>
   A. The fundamentals are very strong. We are likely to have
record traffic and earnings for all four quarters of 1998. Pricing
is good, and fuel prices are at record lows. All of those
conditions have made this a very good year.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, since their July highs, the stocks have sold off by
more than 20 percent. It seems to me that market sentiment is
growing that conditions are as good as they can get and will only
get worse.
</P>
<P>
   There were fears that the weak second-quarter gross domestic
product number would lead to a real slowdown in the second half.
But we are looking for the economy to snap back to more than 3
percent real growth in the last two quarters of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Are there other things that investors are not considering as
they rush to sell airline stocks?
</P>
<P>
   A. The market seems to be overlooking the fact that interest
rates are still low. Traditionally, the up cycle for airline stocks
ends when interest rates go up and earnings are disappointing. But
interest rates have been steady to lower, and earnings continue to
come in as expected or better.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Can you give us an example of just how negative investors are
at the moment?
</P>
<P>
   A. Last month, when American Airlines and Delta announced
earnings for the second quarter, both said they would buy back
large amounts of stock, a total of more than $1 billion worth.
</P>
<P>
   Stock buybacks in the airline industry are rare because airlines
need to spend so much of their cash on new aircraft. And they are
doubly rare when the buybacks are of that magnitude. And yet, when
they made the announcements, the stocks sold off.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What will it take to get a shift in sentiment?
</P>
<P>
   A. We have been waiting for the airline group and the market as
a whole to stabilize. But until some of the volatility shakes out,
it will be difficult for the stocks to mount a sustainable advance.
</P>
<P>
   However, between now and year-end, probably after third-quarter
earnings numbers are released, we should get an investible trading
rally.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What is your outlook for third-quarter earnings?
</P>
<P>
   A. Currently, we expect industry earnings will be up about 20
percent in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   And we are not alone in this regard: The rest of the Street has
not lowered any of their earnings estimates. And the companies have
been saying that their view of the fundamentals really hasn't
changed.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Northwest Airlines is one carrier that doesn't seem to have
terribly positive fundamentals working in its favor at the moment.
They are looking at a major strike, and important Asian routes have
been hurt by the economic crisis in the region. The stock is not on
your buy list, but you recently gave it an outperform rating. Why?
</P>
<P>
   A. Historically, by the time you get to a strike, the bad news
is already discounted in the stock. Moreover, times of labor
disquiet have usually proved to be a good time to buy a stock.
</P>
<P>
   I think the strike is already priced into Northwest's stock, and
I think the Far East is, too.
</P>
<P>
   American Airlines negotiated a contract where costs will go up
about 10 percent over the life of the agreement; it was expensive,
but the rest of the industry is coming up to where it is.
</P>
<P>
   As long as the economy remains solid, those cost increases in
the long run get passed on to the consumer.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Are there stocks you like better than Northwest?
</P>
<P>
   A. We have outperform ratings on six carriers, including America
West, Alaska Airlines and United. And we have strong buy
recommendations on American Airlines and Continental Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What makes those two stocks stand out from the crowd?
</P>
<P>
   A. American's new computerized reservation system, scheduled to
go in place in November, could add upward of $200 million to
revenues. Its alliance with U S Airways, were it to go through,
would also be beneficial, as would the proposed alliance with
British Airways.
</P>
<P>
   Even though much of the turnaround in Continental's fortunes has
taken place, we still like the stock. The pending alliance with
Northwest should incrementally add to earnings next year.
</P>
<P>
   Continental continues to grow internationally, both across the
Atlantic and in Latin America. It is adding new gates in Houston.
And its regional jets and commuter flights are a definite
opportunity to capture more of the business travel market.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Analysts are not supposed to provide advice about which
stocks to stay away from. At this point, are there any you would
avoid?
</P>
<P>
   A. At these prices, there is not much I would stay away from. It
is hard to pick a company to short right now.

 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stockbrokers often complain that a customer never
remembers when their recommendations are proved right, but never
forgets when they're wrong.
</P>
<P>
   But if Wall Street, which makes a handsome living from its
ingrates, suffers these days from swooning prices, there is little
sign that this is putting many jobs at risk.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, brokerage houses expanded at breakneck speed as
the market and economy emerged from the doldrums, only to contract
after the 1987 crash. By contrast, the 1990s have been a time of
more sober hiring even as stock prices skyrocketed. ``In the past,
you've seen hiring booming and busting,'' said Bill Montgoris,
chief operating officer at Bear, Stearns &AMP; Co. ``Now firms have
been much more cautious.''
</P>
<P>
   This suggests that even if the stock market plummets, job
casualties will remain few, mostly a result of mergers or confined
to niches like emerging markets, where disaster has already struck.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there would be a financial pinch _ probably more like a
squeeze _ for tens of thousands of people in the securities
business for whom annual bonuses have reached lavish proportions in
recent years and have driven average industry pay in New York last
year to $181,900, almost four times as much as the $48,800 earned
by the average city worker. (The securities business includes
investment banks as well as brokerage houses.)
</P>
<P>
   An analysis by the office of New York State Comptroller H. Carl
McCall concluded in August that in the event of a downturn,
``securities firms will likely reduce costs by lowering
compensation before resorting to layoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   The industry's deliberate pace of hiring can be seen in the fact
that it wasn't until June that the New York City economy set a
record for the number of Wall Street jobs _ 164,300, according to
the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That eclipsed the 163,000 total in
1987, before the October crash. The reverberations of that crash
led to the loss of one in five securities firms and jobs by 1990,
said Jeffrey Schaefer, a consultant to the Securities Industry
Association, a trade group.
</P>
<P>
   But why has the latest bull market not led to even more hiring
on Wall Street? There is wide agreement on a main reason: Those who
run securities businesses today were chastened by 1987.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not staffed as inappropriately as they were back
then,'' said Brian Sullivan, president of his own executive search
firm in New York that specializes in financial services. Moreover,
he observed, the economy is much stronger now and the industry's
``product line'' is broader and less reliant on junk bonds and
leveraged buyouts.
</P>
<P>
   Other factors that may lessen the industry's vulnerability to a
major market drop are vast improvements in technology and
efficiencies gleaned through mergers. An industry whose back
offices couldn't handle trading volume of 10 million shares a day
without expanded hours now breezes through 600 million shares a day
and more.
</P>
<P>
   After two companies combine, ``you can have two excellent people
but you only need one excellent person to do the job,'' said
Vincent Pica, a senior official at Prudential Securities. He said
Prudential had upgraded its staff by hiring people displaced by
mergers.
</P>
<P>
   Still, employment at member firms of the New York Stock Exchange
keeps climbing, by 3,384 in the first three months of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're adding pretty much universally,'' said Sue Weiss,
employment vice president at A.G. Edwards &AMP; Co., which is based in
St. Louis and has 6,352 brokers in 615 offices. She said last week
that Edwards expected to add 450 to 550 employees this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more brokers, the more support they need,'' Ms. Weiss
said. The company has 228 more brokers than it did a year ago..
</P>
<P>
   Despite turmoil in many foreign currencies, officials say that
currency trading is one area in which job prospects are probably
fading. Mergers are one reason, but even more important is the
scheduled introduction in January of the euro, the European
currency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lots of firms have shut down their New York trading
operation'' to leave the field to better-equipped giants, Sullivan
said. ``There will be less business across the board _ you're
literally eliminating 11 currencies.''

   When the 200 workers at Hawaiian Host wanted a 401(k) plan, a
host of vendors eagerly offered their services. But Stacey
Nakasone, a human resources administrator at the Honolulu company,
which makes chocolate-covered macadamia nuts, said she was
overwhelmed trying to compare prices.

<P>
   Some vendors focused on their administrative costs while others
discussed investment fees; still others promoted special features
of their plans. ``We were taking a stab in the dark,'' Mrs.
Nakasone said.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona Public Service, the gas and electric utility in Phoenix,
faced a different problem. With 6,000 employees in two 401(k)
plans, it wanted to know if it was paying too much in trustee and
record-keeping fees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most businesses really do not have a very good handle on the
costs of their 401(k) because they buy bundled services,'' said Jim
Margerum, a benefits department manager who was in charge of
examining the costs of the 401(k) plans for the utility, which buys
each service separately.
</P>
<P>
   Both administrators, though, were able to consult publications
that help employers analyze and compare costs of 401(k) plans.
</P>
<P>
   Using the ``(k)form Catalog'' from (k)la Publishing in San
Francisco, a committee of Hawaiian Host workers identified 79
potential vendors, then whittled the list to five. A final
selection is expected soon.
</P>
<P>
   Margerum turned to the ``401(k) Provider Directory Averages
Book,'' one of three such guides from HR Investment Consultants in
Baltimore. He found that Arizona Public's record-keeping and
trustee costs ``were very reasonable, very much in line'' with
those of companies of similar size.
</P>
<P>
   For benefits administrators across the country, the directories
offer help in reining in the costs of 401(k)'s. The Labor
Department has identified those costs as an important benefits
issue, and trade publications for benefits managers have written
about the employee lawsuits that companies may face if they do not
control 401(k) expenses.
</P>
<P>
   According to Stephen Butler, president of Pension Dynamics, a
401(k) consulting firm in Orinda, Calif., about a third of all
employers pay too much for their 401(k) plans and another third
waste money on features with little long-term value.
</P>
<P>
   Paying experts to invest the money, to prepare statements for
workers and to comply with government rules can easily cost $1 for
every $100 in the plan; some plans pay vendors more than twice that
amount. There are no hard standards, but the expense share tends to
shrink at bigger companies. The plan at Exxon, for example, costs
just 5 cents for each $100.
</P>
<P>
   Some benefits managers _ particularly at small- to medium-sized
companies just starting a 401(k) _ may have little experience with
such plans. The directories, by providing work sheets for
apples-to-apples comparisons of various expenses, help these
administrators shop for the best deals.
</P>
<P>
   A company with a long-established plan can use the directories,
too _ to help it switch to a less-expensive vendor. Perhaps a
company originally chose a vendor that charged low fees for
record-keeping and trustee services and little or no set-up fee;
the trade-off was that the vendor offered high-cost funds. The
company may decide that such a plan no longer meets its needs.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Schuster, benefits manager for Compuware Corp., a software
manufacturer in Farmington Hills, Mass., with 9,000 employees
worldwide, said that vendors frequently offer free administrative
services ``because for every dollar they make in administrative
fees, they make about $7 in investment fees.''
</P>
<P>
   A small company, of course, might find low start-up and
administrative costs very attractive. But a large company might not
mind a high start-up fee if the subsequent investment fees were
relatively low, giving workers more money when they retire.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, high costs can seriously erode the value of 401(k)
savings. For example, a worker who saves $2,000 annually for 30
years and earns 10 percent a year will have a nest egg of $345,437
before taxes at retirement. But if the fees charged to the plan
reduce the investment return by just one percentage point, to 9
percent, the worker will have just $286,246, or $59,000 less. If
the fees cut two percentage points off the return, the worker will
have just $237,895.
</P>
<P>
   Employers should check their 401(k) costs, said David Morse, a
compensation lawyer at Whitman Breed Abbott &AMP; Morgan in New York.
Companies that pay 401(k) fees out of the savings of workers, he
said, could ``be liable for breaching their fiduciary duty if they
choose vendors that charge excessive fees.''

<P>
   In the old days of 401(k) plans, if the stock market nose-dived
the way it did last week, participants who wanted to change their
allocations usually had to cool their heels for 30 or even 90 days.
Market timing was out of the question.
</P>
<P>
   These days, however, many 401(k) participants can shift assets
on the fly, moving money in or out of different categories of
stocks and bonds with a single phone call. And they can do so daily
if they want, with few restrictions and no penalties or fees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easier than ever for people to switch, and people have
more options available,'' said Tom Schlossberg, president and chief
executive of Diversified Investment Advisors in Purchase, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Some plans limit the number of times a participant can change
their asset allocations to four times a quarter, for example, or to
once a month. Some also restrict movement in and out of
fixed-income investments, to discourage participants from playing
interest rates, Schlossberg said. But these days the majority of
plans allow unlimited daily changes.
</P>
<P>
   When an investor moves ordinary assets around, capital gains on
sales are taxable right away. But gains in 401(k) plans are not
taxable until the assets are withdrawn, usually after retirement,
so there are significant tax advantages to using 401(k) assets to
satisfy any urge to time the market.
</P>
<P>
   While most 401(k) participants now have that opportunity, hardly
any are using it.
</P>
<P>
   Ned Burmeister, second vice president for pensions at Principal
Financial Group, a 401(k) administration company in Des Moines,
offered two possible reasons. Participants are either financially
savvy and know they are investing for the long haul, he said, or
they are paralyzed by inertia _ not knowing what to do, they do
nothing.
</P>
<P>
   During the market gyrations in July, Robert Rudell, president of
Scudder-Kemper Retirement Services in Boston, saw a slight uptick
in phone calls, but little shifting of money by its 350,000
participants. ``With so little activity in this current market
swing,'' Rudell said, it shows that ``we've done a pretty decent
job of education.''
</P>
<P>
   In its 401(k) index, which tracks the daily transfers of 1.4
million participants at large companies, Hewitt Associates, a
management consulting firm in Lincolnshire, Ill., has found that
fewer than 1 percent move money when the market goes haywire.
</P>
<P>
   For example, during the market crash of Oct. 27, 1997, the
Hewitt index showed four times its normal activity. But even so,
just under 1 percent of the participants made changes, transferring
two-tenths of 1 percent of their $62 billion in assets from stocks
to fixed-income investments.
</P>
<P>
   The same pattern has held true this year. On July 30, when the
Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock
index were both up over 1 percent, the index showed about twice the
average amount of switching activity _ mostly shifts from bonds to
stocks _ said Stacy Schaus, a Hewitt consultant. The next day, when
both stock indexes tumbled nearly 2 percent, the Hewitt index
showed that switching activity grew to three times the average as
participants moved from equities into fixed-income investments.
</P>
<P>
   The small minority who do such shifting might not be helping
themselves, Ms. Schaus said. Jumping to a different asset category
on the day of a plunge means that ``they're locking in a loss,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Most people do so thinking that they are timing the market, but
they often misunderstand a fundamental difference between changing
mutual fund allocations and buying or selling stocks directly.
</P>
<P>
   Karnig Durgarian, managing director and chief of Putnam
Investments' defined contribution business in Boston, observed that
in a typical plan, where the majority of assets are in mutual
funds, transactions do not take place until the end of the day. An
investor may call at 10 a.m. hoping to get out of a sliding market
early, but the assets must still ride out the day before being
transferred, he said. And if things look rosier the next morning, a
call at sunup to switch back before prices recover will also be
futile.
</P>
<P>
   ``You think you got back in early?'' he said. ``You didn't.''
Instead, the investor has absorbed all of the bad day's losses and
missed all of the good day's gains.

ONE AMWAY PRODUCT YOUR AUNT WON'T SELL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Aug. 30)  
 (bl)  
 By EDWARD WYATT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. _ After decades of peddling soap, detergent
and toothpaste to Middle America, Amway Corp., the direct-marketing
juggernaut, wants to clean up in another line of business: mutual
funds.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch and Fidelity Investments shouldn't be too
concerned. Amway's army of more than 1 million distributors won't
be hawking fund shares at neighborhood coffee klatches or at the
office water cooler. Nor will they seek to sign up their friends
and neighbors to sell the fund in the type of multilevel marketing
plan for which the company is famous.
</P>
<P>
   For now, at least, Amway distributors are the target buyers, not
sellers, of shares of the Amway Mutual fund. ``This is not soap,
where we market to our distributors and they sell to customers and
receive bonuses based on sales,'' said James Rosloniec, an Amway
vice president who oversees the company's mutual fund efforts.
``But we would like to make the fund more noticeable.''
</P>
<P>
   In short, Amway wants its $162 million stock fund to grow and
possibly multiply into a family of mutual funds. That, in turn,
could let Amway funds expand into corporate retirement plans and,
thus, reach more investors outside the Amway family circle.
</P>
<P>
   Amway, whose $7 billion in worldwide sales makes it one of the
country's largest privately held companies, is not a newcomer to
the mutual fund game. The fund was started in 1971, making it older
than 90 percent of all diversified equity funds. And it is by no
means a clunker. While it has never finished at the top of the fund
rankings, it has rarely strayed far from the middle of the pack of
the large-capitalization funds tracked by Morningstar Inc., the
financial publisher in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Over the 10 years ended Aug. 21, the fund returned an average of
15.2 percent a year, less than the 18.3 percent of the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500-stock index but ahead of the 14 percent of its large-cap
value peers.
</P>
<P>
   The fund has remained small, Rosloniec said, because Amway has
never really tried to attract investors. ``It was started as a sort
of paternal thing on the part of the company's owners, a kind of
savings program,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Certain Amway distributors, in addition to receiving an annual
cash bonus based on product sales, can also receive a
profit-sharing bonus, which is paid in fund shares. In January, for
example, Amway bought $14.1 million in fund shares, equivalent to
about 10 percent of the fund's assets, which it transferred to
distributors as bonuses.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, while the Amway fund is open to any investor who
inquires, Amway employees and distributors own the vast majority of
the fund's shares. The largest holder, with 15 percent of the
shares, is a partnership and foundation affiliated with Jay Van
Andel, one of Amway's two co-founders.
</P>
<P>
   The sales expansion effort, at least initially, is likely to be
low-key. ``I don't anticipate that we'll be taking out an ad in the
newspaper next to Fidelity,'' Rosloniec said. Instead, the company
is likely to include information about the fund in monthly
advertising packages mailed to distributors.
</P>
<P>
   Amway is also looking for a ``national marketing organization''
to help it expand its reach, Rosloniec said. In addition,
shareholders recently approved several changes intended to make the
fund ``more marketable,'' he said. Among other things, they
eliminated the fund's 3 percent sales charge and added a continuing
distribution, or 12b-1, fee, of 0.25 percent; the fee can be used
to compensate financial advisers or others who might eventually
sell shares of the fund.
</P>
<P>
   So why would a giant direct marketer use intermediaries to sell
its mutual fund? Fund shares, like those of ordinary companies, are
securities, and to sell them an individual is required to hold a
license _ something that most Amway distributors do not have.
</P>
<P>
   Amway argues that the expansion will bolster the fund's assets,
which, through economies of scale, may result in a lower expense
ratio. Last year, fund shareholders paid 0.90 percent of assets in
expenses, not including the 3 percent sales load. This year,
including the 12b-1 fee, they will pay 1.15 percent of assets.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Amway hopes to reach even more investors by
participating in retirement programs. But to crack that market, the
company will probably have to expand its menu of offerings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably logical for us to have an array of different
types of funds'' to serve the retirement market, Rosloniec said,
including a fixed-income fund. Also under consideration is a
charitable gift trust, similar to one offered by Fidelity, which
allows investors to make charitable donations in the form of
appreciated shares of stock.
</P>
<P>
   The question of who will manage or be the sub-adviser for any
new offerings will depend on the funds' investment objectives. The
portfolio of the existing fund is guided by Ark Asset Management, a
New York money manager that has served as sub-adviser since 1995.
At the end of June, the fund's assets were spread across about 80
stocks, mostly blue chips.
</P>
<P>
   Not among them is Procter &AMP; Gamble, which has sued Amway twice,
and certain of its distributors at least seven times since the
early 1980s, contending that the company encouraged its
distributors to spread false statements about the company,
including rumors linking Procter &AMP; Gamble to Satanism. Amway has
denied the accusations, contending that Procter &AMP; Gamble has
engaged in a false public relations campaign of its own.
</P>
<P>
   Prospective investors should be aware of one key difference
between Amway Mutual and the company's nonfinancial products.
Unlike, say, Amway's Glister toothpaste, the fund does not come
with a money-back guarantee.

BOONIES MAY BECOME 'BURBS ONE DAY ALL TOO SOON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By J.R. LABBE 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOMEWHERE OUTSIDE OF BURLESON, Texas _ The hand-lettered sign
tacked to the utility pole was the first indication that city life
was far behind.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of advertising help for an easy way to lose 10 pounds in
10 days, the note was letting the owner of a lost lamb know that
the little critter had been found and where to come get it.
</P>
<P>
   The official welcome took the form of a coyote serenade. With
the move into our new house, we traded the incessant yapping of a
neighbor's dachshund for the eerie predawn yips and howls from a
chorus of coyotes. We're much happier with the wild sounds,
although our cat's nocturnal strolls have been drastically
curtailed.
</P>
<P>
   The first time we heard high-pitched wails filling the air
before the sun tinged the sky pink came just hours after our
neighbor casually walked two wayward head of cattle across our
front yard.
</P>
<P>
   We definitely had left city life behind. The question now is:
For how long?
</P>
<P>
   My husband and I are part of that growing number of people
engaged in the process of reverse migration. Although we have not
yet forsaken urban jobs to live in the wilds of Montana, we tried
the next best thing by moving to a rural area beyond the busy
traffic loop that circles through Fort Worth and Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   It's only a matter of time, however, before the city follows.
Urban exodus is happening all over the nation. Our specific journey
took us to the rural area south of Fort Worth, but counties to the
west of Cowtown are also experiencing explosive growth. According
to the North Central Texas Council of Governments, Johnson County
has experienced a population boom from 97,165 in 1990 to 112,800
this year. Building permits for single-family homes are up 30
percent in Parker, Johnson and Hood counties.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, all the attributes that make rural living so
attractive _ no crowds, no traffic, no neighbor right over the back
fence _ wane as more and more people search for an escape from an
urban dwelling. The next thing you know, there will be zoning
restrictions, and permits needed to build a storage shed on your
own property, and emissions tests on automobiles, and a 10-minute
wait at the traffic light to get on the highway that leads to the
city.
</P>
<P>
   Rural life isn't for everyone. A move to the boonies comes with
compromises. Services that city folk take for granted _ rapid
response from public safety personnel, a hospital with a fully
equipped emergency room close by, municipal water and sewer lines _
aren't always available. You learn to live with septic systems and
volunteer fire departments and relying on the county sheriff _ and
yourself _ for crime protection.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, all members of the Labbe household are adjusting to
rural life. Our dog, a gentle giant of a German shepherd whose
previous brushes with wildlife were confined to chasing gray
squirrels up backyard trees, is mesmerized by the huge, lumbering
livestock that inhabit the acreage adjoining ours. Her first
glimpse of a cow stopped her dead in her tracks, as if she were
thinking, ``I've never seen squirrels this size before!''
</P>
<P>
   An instinct buried someplace deep within her shepherd soul
pushed her toward the bovine creatures quietly grazing across the
field, but she didn't appear sure of how to tap into what her
nature was telling her. A stamped hoof and a breathy snort from one
cow was enough to send the dog high-tailing it back to the safety
of the garage.
</P>
<P>
   It is so very quiet out here, in this place removed from the
white noise of highway traffic that was a constant backdrop to our
lives in the city. When a truck with an unmuffled engine does drive
by the house, it's such a jar to the senses that even the dog barks
_ the same dog that used to sleep through the next-door neighbor's
work on the noisy engine of his vintage Mustang.
</P>
<P>
   We know that more of you are coming, but it's OK with us if you
take your time.

<P>
   Once again Russia is having a change of government. This is
symptomatic of a dangerous problem. The highly touted ``energetic
technocrat'' whose approval by the legislature was obtained after
much arm-twisting is out. The acting prime minister is Viktor
Chernomyrdin, sourly dismissed a few months ago.
</P>
<P>
   The pundits are at a loss wondering how to interpret these
developments. The answer, however, is simple. Another attempt to
force a set of impossible economic programs on the country has
failed. Now our failed leaders are casting about for a straw to
grasp.
</P>
<P>
   The failure of the policy course pursued since 1992 is so
obvious that it has now been recognized officially.
</P>
<P>
   The country is being swept by a new devastating wave of the
financial crisis. The stock market hits new lows every day. Despite
having obtained multibillion dollar loans abroad, the Russian
government has been forced to take emergency measures to halt the
free-fall or at least to ease the economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The devaluation of the ruble and the real threat of bankruptcy
have demonstrated that the system born of the reckless, selfishly
conceived reforms of the 1990s is unsustainable. A speculative
economy, a corrupt government, a criminalized environment, tens of
millions of forgotten and abandoned people: Such is the outcome of
the Yeltsin era.
</P>
<P>
   The defining fact today is the credibility gap dividing the
authorities and Russian society. The crisis is not so much economic
as political.
</P>
<P>
   Until very recently, the president and his entourage tried to
ignore this fact. Today they seem to be waking up to what's
happening. Continuing to cling to power while closing their eyes
and plugging their ears could be self-defeating. The appointment of
Chernomyrdin as acting prime minister is therefore likely to signal
the beginning of the process of transferring power to an heir
apparent. We are witnessing Yeltsin's political sunset.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there is a hidden agenda here. By all indications, the
president wants to use Chernomyrdin to try to prolong his political
existence, to somehow make it to the constitutionally mandated
election time. The new premier has thus been assigned the role of
the chief firefighter called in to save the regime.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Chernomyrdin too needs time to raise his
extremely low popularity rating in preparation for presidential
elections. The prime minister's office gives him leverage to do
that, but it is unlikely that he will succeed, given the depth of
the crisis and the current lineup of political forces.
</P>
<P>
   But is there perhaps some hope that the ``heavyweight''
Chernomyrdin has been called in for a different purpose _ that at
long last he will form a government capable of changing the course.
</P>
<P>
   Much as one might wish to believe it, it is unlikely. The
extraordinary difficulties Russia is experiencing today began, as
everyone knows, on Chernomyrdin's watch and with his involvement.
Thus the reemergence of Chernomyrdin does nothing to address the
federal authority's credibility problem. It does not create the
trust needed to solve any major issue.
</P>
<P>
   The call for early elections, therefore, continues to be timely
and urgent. Indeed, early elections of the president and of the
Duma, which bears its share of responsibility for what has happened
to Russia, are indispensable, as is a referendum to amend the
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   I am convinced that the role of the legislature should be
increased. It is very important to normalize the presidency. Russia
needs a balanced system of institutions of government. Only a
strong, functional parliament and an effective cabinet and
president can implement policies of economic growth and Russia's
revival.
</P>
<P>
   The state has to play an essential regulating role to help
realize the country's enormous potential.
</P>
<P>
   Today conditions are still in place to conduct early elections
in an orderly way, taking advantage of the fact that the widespread
popular discontent has not yet burst out in extreme forms. But the
legendary patience of the Russian people should not be tested too
long. It has its limits.

LINCOLN-MERCURY ATTRACTING BOOMERS WITH UPSCALE SPORT-UTILITY
VEHICLES
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanied by CARS-GLANCE) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For years, the luxury-car lines of Ford and General Motors have
struggled to draw well-heeled baby boomers into dealers' showrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Middle-age consumers have tended to associate Lincoln and
Cadillac products with their parents and have generally left those
cars to the older generation.
</P>
<P>
   But that's changing now. Lincoln-Mercury showrooms are busy
places, thanks to boomers' love affair with sport-utility vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Mercury started bringing boomers into Lincoln-Mercury showrooms
with the Mountaineer, an upscale version of the best-selling Ford
Explorer sport-utility, a couple of years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But it is this week's test drive, the Lincoln Navigator, that
has dealerships really buzzing with boomers.
</P>
<P>
   The Navigator, like the Mountaineer, is an scale version of a
sport-utility being sold by the Ford division: the full-size Ford
Expedition.
</P>
<P>
   Introduced for the 1998 model year, the Navigator takes the
Expedition to a higher level with a revised exterior than includes
lots of chrome, an interior flush with leather and wood trim, and a
$40,000-plus price tag.
</P>
<P>
   The vehicle, which is about 15 inches shorter than the
Texas-favorite Chevrolet/GMC Suburban, is priced way below three of
its intended competitors, the Toyota Land Cruiser and its clone,
the Lexus LX 470; and the Range Rover. Those vehicles start at
about $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Navigator also has a giant plus: Underneath, it's really a
Ford F-150 pickup, which is the nation's best-selling vehicle and
has a well-deserved reputation for toughness, reliability and
longevity.
</P>
<P>
   The downside, of course, is that being an F-150 underneath, the
Navigator is a truck, not a car. The ride, therefore, is not as
smooth as you would expect from a Town Car or Continental. It's not
bad, though, thanks in part to the standard load-leveling air
suspension. But if your bones are getting somewhat creaky, you
might want to go with a plush sedan.
</P>
<P>
   For me, a sport-utility is just fine, and the Navigator is one
of the best on the market. You could save $6,000-$12,000 by
choosing a less-cushy and less-well-equipped Expedition, of course,
but if you can afford the extra fare, the Navigator offers just
about everything you could want in a luxury SUV.
</P>
<P>
   It is powered by Ford's 230-horsepower, 5.4-liter V-8 engine,
connected to a smooth-shifting four-speed automatic transmission.
There is plenty of power to push this 5,000-pound vehicle. The
engine cranks out 325 foot-pounds of torque at 3,000 rpm, enough to
move the Navigator off the starting line with the rest of the SUV
pack.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if you are used to a similar V-8 engine powering a
sedan that is 1,500 pounds lighter, you might be a bit
disappointed. But those of you used to driving trucks and SUVs will
be pleased with the Navigator's power.
</P>
<P>
   Handling is what you'd expect from a large vehicle; it's not
real nimble, but it's not as clunky as a Suburban. And it will fit
in the standard garage and downtown parallel parking space, unlike
the Suburban. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The interior is plush, with leather, nice burled-walnut trim in
the dashboard and thick pile carpeting throughout.
</P>
<P>
   Standard seating includes bucket seats up front and in the
second row; a bench seat is in the third row, seating an additional
three people for a total of seven.
</P>
<P>
   Although our test vehicle came with the center-row bucket seats,
if I were ordering a Navigator I would choose the optional
three-passenger bench seat for the middle. It was awkward having
just four seats in the front part of the vehicle; a fifth person
going to lunch with me one day had to climb into the rear seat, not
an easy task for grown-ups.
</P>
<P>
   With the third seat in place for passengers, there is not much
luggage space. That's where the Navigator comes up short compared
with the Suburban; that extra 15 inches in the Suburban is tacked
onto the cargo area. The Navigator's third seat can be folded down
easily to increase luggage space. Loading is easy; you can open the
whole tailgate by lifting it up, or open just the tailgate window
to sling grocery bags into the back.
</P>
<P>
   Navigator is available with two- or four-wheel drive. The
two-wheel-drive model carries a base price of $39,310 (plus $640
transportation). The four-wheel-drive version lists for $42,660.
</P>
<P>
   For my money, I would go with the four-wheel drive, even in
generally snowless Texas. Our test model was two-wheel drive, and I
found the tail-end slipping and sliding on wet pavement and losing
traction in turns. Those problems would be eliminated with the
four-wheel-drive system, which can be set to bring the front wheels
on line automatically when rear-wheel slippage is detected.
Besides, why buy half a truck when you can get a whole one for
$3,350 more?
</P>
<P>
   Although this really is an Expedition underneath, it looks like
a Lincoln, thanks to the chrome-edged, turbine-vane signature
grille.
</P>
<P>
   Safety equipment includes power four-wheel disc antilock brakes,
second-generation (depowered) driver and front-passenger air bags,
side-door protection beams, and rear-door child-safety locks.
</P>
<P>
   Automatic climate control is standard; our vehicle came with the
optional rear air-conditioning/heating unit ($705) to keep even the
rearmost passengers comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Navigator is a truck, sound-deadening materials
have made the interior nearly as quiet as that of a luxury sedan.
That makes it easy to carry on a conversation, or enjoy the nice
AM/FM/cassette stereo. A six-disc remote compact-disc changer is a
$595 option; the basic stereo can be upgraded to a 290-watt,
seven-speaker premium system for $355.
</P>
<P>
   Other standard features include cruise control, 16-inch aluminum
wheels, dual six-way power seats, digital clock, dual power
mirrors, fog lights, power door locks with remote control,
leather-wrapped tilt steering, power windows, rear privacy glass,
rear defroster, luggage rack and a trailer-towing package.
</P>
<P>
   Total price for our test vehicle was $40,800, including
transportation.
</P>
<P>
   Maximum trailer weight is 8,000 pounds in the two-wheel-drive
model (with optional 3.73 rear-axle), and 7,700 pounds with the
four-wheel-drive version. The base two- wheel-drive can tow a
6,600-pound trailer.
</P>
<P>
   EPA fuel-economy ratings are 13 miles per gallon in the city and
17 mpg on the highway. The tank holds 30 gallons of fuel.

 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: The graphics on some Web pages are distorted.
Is there something I can do to make them clearer? I can't even read
them.
</P>
<P>
   _ Blurred
</P>
<P>
   DEAR BLURRED: Well, I always try to sober up a bit before I
begin surfing.
</P>
<P>
   If that doesn't work, your display settings are probably wrong.
Web graphics are usually designed from a palette of at least 256
colors. If your computer is only displaying 16 colors, the graphics
are going to look like bad photocopies of somebody's hindquarters,
which, incidentally, I wish you people would stop mailing me.
</P>
<P>
   If you have enough video memory to display more colors, changing
your settings will make everything look better. In Windows 95/98,
right-click on an empty spot on the desktop and pick Properties
from the menu that appears. On the Settings tab is a box showing
available color settings. Make the change, then do a restart.
</P>
<P>
   If that box only shows 16 colors, you either don't have enough
video memory or you don't have the right display driver, the little
program that tells your display what it's capable of. If you have a
name-brand PC, go to the manufacturer's Web site and download the
correct driver for your model. If you have a clone or a junker,
you'll have to figure out who built the motherboard or video card,
then hope the manufacturer has a download site.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: What is pipe cache?
</P>
<P>
   _ In the Dark
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DARK: Isn't that something crackheads need to get high? I,
of course, know nothing about such things.
</P>
<P>
   Now, ``pipeline'' cache is a different matter altogether.
Pipelining is the continuous flow of instructions to the processor
chip. While the chip is working on one instruction, another is
already in the pipeline, sort of like in the assembly line at GM,
unless those parts plants go on strike again.
</P>
<P>
   A cache is a chunk of memory dedicated to holding that sort of
data temporarily, making it rapidly accessible to the
microprocessor. Think of it as a waiting room for your data. Stuff
may be coming in or going out too fast for some component to handle
it, so it waits temporarily in the cache until it can be processed.
Generally speaking, microprocessors can handle data much faster
than regular memory can deliver it. Cache memory serves it up
faster.
</P>
<P>
   Level-1 (or L1) cache memory is built into the microprocessor
and delivers its load more quickly. PowerPC chips use L1. L2 is
usually on a separate chip, but still faster than regular RAM. And,
as with everything else in computing except the price tag, the
bigger the number, the better. Most current PCs have 512K caches.
</P>
<P>
   Aren't you sorry you asked? Most people just ignore all those
numbers and get the computer than runs fastest in the showroom.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: Are you in favor of forcing computer
administrators to speak English?
</P>
<P>
   Englishmajor\Nnamelesscorp.mad
</P>
<P>
   DEAR MAJOR: Yes. I also fervently believe that pigs can fly, and
the only reason they don't is a lack of motivation.
</P>
<P>
   Computer geeks are no different. They too often live in their
own little world of bits and bytes, falling into an arcane patois
of their own making that only their ilk understand, seeing no
compelling reason to leap out of their trees. But if you take one
out to the ballgame, buy him some nachos and pump a few beers in
him, you'll find he's pretty much the same as any other human, and
can even speak your language if pressed. But if he starts yapping
about pipeline cache while McGwire's up to bat, just pop him one in
the schnoz.

FUNDS WATCH: FEELING THE PAIN OF CONCENTRATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Aug. 30)  
 (ART ADV: Graphic on assets and total return for Yacktman is being
sent to NYT graphic clients. Non-subscribers can make individual
purchase by calling (888) 603-1036 or (888) 346-9867.)  
 (bl)  
 By CAROLE GOULD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Don Yacktman has garnered quite a following over a three decade
career as a value investor. But loyalty, alas, can be fleeting.
Investors have abandoned his flagship Yacktman fund in droves as
returns have sputtered.
</P>
<P>
   Assets of the fund have shrunk 43 percent, to $616.4 million as
of Aug. 21 from $1.08 billion in December 1997. The fund returned
18.3 percent last year, well below the average 23.7 percent return
for mid-capitalization blend funds, which may hold a range of
different-sized companies and tend to invest with a combination of
growth and value styles. The underperformance continued this year:
Yacktman dropped 5.8 percent through Aug. 21 while its peers eked
out a gain of one-half percent, according to Morningstar Inc., the
Chicago financial publisher.
</P>
<P>
   Still, bailing out now is probably the wrong thing to do,
experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nature of concentrated funds is that they're volatile,''
said Amy Granzin, an equity analyst at Morningstar, referring to
the relatively small number of stocks _ 23 _ in the fund's
portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Stolper, a financial consultant in San Diego, said
investors should take a longer-term outlook. ``Our view is that
he's been less than optimal over the last two years, but we measure
performance over 10 years. What happens in shorter periods is
almost random.''
</P>
<P>
   The poor performance stands in sharp contrast to Yacktman's
earlier record as manager of Selected American Shares, which he ran
from 1983 until 1992, when he left to start his own fund company.
During his tenure, Selected American, a large-cap value fund, had
an annualized return of 17.6 percent, exceeding the 14.1 percent of
its peers and the 16.7 percent of the Standard and Poor's 500-stock
index. In 1991, Yacktman was named Morningstar's manager of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   He earned those returns using a disciplined approach to
unearthing out-of-favor growth companies with high returns on
tangible assets, few fixed assets and a high turnover of products
and services. Most important for Yacktman is how a company uses its
cash, a key point of departure from many value investors. The best
use of cash, he says, is reinvesting in the business or making
acquisitions that fit well with existing operations. He prefers
management that buys back shares. Less favorable uses, he says, are
paying down debt or paying dividends.
</P>
<P>
   In managing his new fund, however, Yacktman felt free to abandon
the big-company tilt he used so successfully at Selected American.
Over the past two years, he has sold off many large-cap holdings,
notably drug stocks like Bristol-Myers Squibb, Pfizer and Merck,
which he thought had reached full valuation, and looked for
opportunities in smaller companies.
</P>
<P>
   But the shift took place during a period when the market favored
larger stocks and the fund has suffered accordingly. With currency
devaluations and other global problems, ``a lot of people threw
money at America as a safe haven, not as a value judgment but as a
market judgment,'' he said. ``What was already overvalued became
more overvalued.''
</P>
<P>
   One prominent laggard, however, has been one of his remaining
big stocks _ Philip Morris. It accounts for 15 percent of the fund,
but is down 3.3 percent this year through Aug. 21. ``Philip Morris
is doing well on an earnings and cash-flow basis,'' he said, adding
that if the company's Kraft Foods unit were valued on the same
basis as another company, Heinz, that alone would justify the share
price. ``So you get the cigarette business, which accounts for
two-thirds of the business, for free,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He plans no changes to his portfolio, which he characterizes as
defensive.
</P>
<P>
   Yacktman started the Yacktman Focused fund in April 1997, and
the $59 million fund, which holds 13 stocks of various market
capitalizations, has trounced its older sibling. It has returned
11.3 percent annually, on average, since inception and is off 0.29
percent this year through Aug. 21, according to Morningstar.
</P>
<P>
   Yacktman, while currently invested in both funds, plans to put
his future money into Focused. ``We believe in concentrating to get
better results,'' he said.

INVESTING IN YEAR-2000 SOLUTIONS, INCUBATED IN ISRAEL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Aug. 30)  
 (bl)  
 By JESSICA STEINBERG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEL AVIV, Israel _ As with any issue in Israel, there are two
sides to the 488-day countdown to the new millennium. There is the
religious side, with several groups on global missions to guide
Jews toward celebrating the Sabbath when New Year's Eve falls on a
Friday night in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   And there is the business side, as several hundred software
engineers implement Israeli millennium-bug solutions worldwide,
making sure computers know to switch to 2000 instead of back to
1900. Known in industry shorthand as Y2K, the computer issue has
become a vital management concern for businesses and government
agencies around the world as they rush to convert computer systems
in time.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has been an incubator for several companies specializing
in diagnostic software and antivirus technology, thanks to a rich
lode of skilled workers, including Israeli military veterans who
honed their skills on classified army information systems and
Russian immigrants who flooded into the country in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the heart of the Israeli Y2K industry is a supply of
mainframe-trained programmers,'' said Jim Duggan, year-2000
research director at the Gartner Group, a market research company.
``I guess we have the former Soviet Union to thank for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Several of the small Israeli technology companies that are
successfully selling year-2000 solutions are listed on Nasdaq. Two
of them, Crystal Systems Solutions and Forsoft Ltd., are part of
the Formula Systems high-technology holding group; a third, Sapiens
International, is independent.
</P>
<P>
   Crystal, founded in 1987, developed a general-purpose software
conversion tool called C-Mill and began marketing it in 1990,
initially without any reference to the millennium bug, said Ben
Levy, head of marketing at Crystal. But it soon proved especially
useful in rooting out and correcting certain software problems,
applying an automated find-and-fix process that allowed Crystal to
capitalize on the millennium-bug boom. A partnership with the
management consulting side of the accounting giant Ernst &AMP; Young
brought Crystal its first millennium-bug client in the United
States, Eastman Kodak.
</P>
<P>
   ``Y2K is about looking for needles in the haystack, and C-Mill
is the magnet,'' Duggan said.
</P>
<P>
   According to Tom Leib, a millennium-bug analyst at Ernst &AMP;
Young, which operates service centers for the problem in Chicago
and Costa Mesa, Calif., C-Mill effectively shifts a computer's
internal frame of reference by a certain number of years to
sidestep the millennium. When that change alone is insufficient,
C-Mill searches through computer programs for variables that appear
to be dates, indexing them and adding digits.
</P>
<P>
   C-Mill's success has come to dominate Crystal, which now depends
on year-2000 projects for 90 percent to 95 percent of its revenue,
much more than its Israeli counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   Elan Zivotofsky, a high-technology analyst for Goldman, Sachs &AMP;
Co. in Jerusalem, estimates that Crystal, which had $10.8 million
in revenue in the second quarter of 1998, should remain strong for
the next 18 months because of peaking demand for year-2000
solutions. After Dec. 31, 1999, has come and gone, though, ``it's a
show-me story,'' Zivotofsky said.
</P>
<P>
   At Forsoft, Crystal's sibling, year 2000 projects accounted for
only a quarter of the company's 1997 revenue of $30 million, with
the millennium-bug work ``serving as a door opener'' for other
business, Zivotofsky said. Forsoft is a service company that uses
Crystal's C-Mill to help Israel's blue-chip companies and several
government departments manage year-2000 problems. Clients have
included Bank Leumi and the Israeli military. ``Forsoft is clearly
the leading Y2K service provider in Israel,'' Zivotofsky said. But
it does little work overseas.
</P>
<P>
   The year-2000 problem has spawned an immense but fragmented
industry throughout the industrialized world, in which small but
nimble companies can find profitable niches. The Gartner Group
estimates that $300 billion to $600 billion will be spent globally
on software-related year-2000 issues alone. (When hardware,
personnel, litigation and other aspects of the problem are added,
the global figure is expected to exceed $1 trillion.)
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, the Federal Reserve puts projected
spending on software repair by businesses at $50 billion, with the
federal government expected to spend $5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Sapiens is banking on that government spending, especially by
the IRS, to fuel its sales of software development tools. The
company's products can translate mainframe programs written in the
assembler computer language, which are obsolete but still widely
used, into more modern languages, making year-2000 problems much
easier to identify and repair.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Belkin, an analyst at Hambrecht &AMP; Quist in San Francisco,
compares Sapiens' mapping technique to taking inventory,
classifying and counting pieces of code instead of boxes and parts.
``Sapiens has a hybrid mentality, which is probably why we like
it,'' Belkin said. ``It has a post-Y2K market, but the year 2000 is
also a great opportunity for Sapiens to get its foot in the
mainstream market door.''
</P>
<P>
   The company thinks the market for tools to fix year-2000
problems in mainframe software will be about $7.5 billion, and it
contributed 60 percent of Sapiens' revenue of $30 million for the
first half of 1998, said Ron Zuckerman, the company's president.
``We're practically the only ones out there with this knowledge,''
he said, ``so we've been able to establish a name for ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Duggan of the Gartner Group estimates that Sapiens has about
half of the relatively narrow market for assembler conversions.
</P>
<P>
   Many companies using multiple computer systems have tackled the
more straightforward, high-volume year-2000 conversions first _
desktop computers and mini-computers _ and saved the thornier, more
painstaking mainframe work for last, Zuckerman said. Now, with time
growing short, they are starting to sweat, he said, and Sapiens
stands to reap long-term gains as they discover that his company
can help.
</P>
<P>
   Belkin of Hambrecht &AMP; Quist said corporate executives were only
now realizing that year-2000 conversions could not be done
overnight and were looking for outside vendors with proven track
records and turnaround times.

Russian economy at present exchange rates. In other words, in one

Russia off the world map. Japan is so monumental as to be central
to the health of the global economy, but for now it remains a mess,
albeit an impressively large one. A month after Prime Minister

MEDIA'S SNOOPING IN MAC'S LOCKER COULD BENEFIT ATHLETES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By DAVID A. MARKIEWICZ 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Go ahead and say it already. Somehow you just knew this glorious
Chase for Sixty-two was going to be tainted.
</P>
<P>
   And by who else but the media. There they go again, poking
around in Mark McGwire's locker, and before you know it, we've got
Steroid-gate.
</P>
<P>
   Big Mac pumped-up on something other than free weights? Please.
The guy hit 49 home runs in his rookie season. Back then, he was
just a skinny kid. It's not like this is Duane Kuiper chasing
Maris, right?
</P>
<P>
   Besides, it's legal. Besides, it's OK by Major League Baseball.
If he wants to play fast-and-easy with that bad body of his, let
him. He's a big boy.
</P>
<P>
   If only he'd kept his stall free of everything other than Right
Guard, maybe the sports scandal of the summer would never have
happened.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe, some say, if only nosy reporters had kept the contents
of McGwire's locker to themselves. Then Big Red and Sammy Sosa
could duel in relative peace, if not obscurity.
</P>
<P>
   Journalists, naturally, would dispute such thinking. McGwire's
bottle of Androstenedione was in plain sight, they'd say, and
reporters are allowed in the locker room for the expressed purpose
of finding stories, after all. Further, they might add, anything
that could affect the performance of a man bidding to break one of
baseball's hallowed records is news. Big news.
</P>
<P>
   It's not like the media have gone off half-cocked in this case,
either. The stories I've read all mentioned that there is nothing
illegal about Andro and that it has the seal of tolerance of Major
League Baseball.
</P>
<P>
   But hold on a minute. There may be something bigger about this
story, something more important than another oxygen-draining debate
over news coverage and press freedoms. Something that better
justifies the reporter's prying eye and its intrusion on one man's
privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Call it greater awareness of a potential health risk, or call it
the better-safe-than-sorry theory.
</P>
<P>
   If that first ``Mac uses Andro'' story had never broken, there
probably would never have been the intense scrutiny that we have
witnessed this week of the use of sports supplements by athletes.
</P>
<P>
   Before Steroid-gate, even many major-league baseball players
didn't know what Andro is, or so they say. You can bet a lot of
high school and college athletes didn't know about it either.
Critics say writing about Andro now is going to cause a clamor for
these magic pills, for better or worse.
</P>
<P>
   In the short run, maybe it will. But it's also causing many
sports officials, administrators, coaches and athletes to
reconsider and study Andro and other performance-enhancers. That's
essential. A lot more knowledge is needed before they are approved,
recommended and ingested.
</P>
<P>
   Just consider what happened this past week.
</P>
<P>
   Major League Baseball executives and the baseball player's union
asked doctors to gather more information about the effects of
muscle-builders including Andro. Baseball has allowed the use of
Andro, unlike the NFL, the NCAA and the International Olympic
Committee, but that could change.
</P>
<P>
   A pro tennis official said the men's tour had banned Andro and
cited the McGwire controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Boise State's athletic director said the school will re-examine
its practice of distributing the strength-building supplement,
creatine, free of charge to its athletes. The NCAA is deciding
whether to ban the substance.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Andro, creatine or any other muscle-building sports
supplement is harmful to a person's health is a matter of
uncertainty, even among doctors. New studies might provide enough
information, however, to either impose permanent bans or to give
some reasonable assurances of their safe usage.
</P>
<P>
   Would this sudden call for research into sports supplements have
happened _ this quickly _ if not for the McGwire incident?
</P>
<P>
   A Denver Post columnist this week had his baseball writer's
credentials revoked for the season after he was spotted examining a
bottle of Andro he had pulled from the locker of Colorado Rockies
star Dante Bichette. Clearly, the writer crossed the line and
invaded Bichette's privacy when he dug into his stall.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of McGwire, there was no such intrusion, even though
many of the initial stories focused too much on him and his use of
Andro and not enough on the larger issue of sports supplement
usage.
</P>
<P>
   More significant, the information obtained has shined a bright
light on what has been for too long a shadowy subject. Getting this
all out in the open now and dealing with the health risks of sports
supplements is the greater good. Not just for readers, but for
athletes, too.

AIDS ACTIVIST ADMITS MAILING BOGUS BILLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC BRAZIL  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A Sacramento AIDS activist said that it was he
who mailed 4,000 bogus letters billing Northern Californians for
$76 as an attention-getting device to persuade Gov. Pete Wilson to
declare a state of medical emergency because of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   ``The letter is intended to open up a public dialogue with those
who are behind the governor, who have a tremendous amount of
influence with him,'' Marc Keyser, who founded the AIDS Action
League in Sacramento in 1988, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The letter, which directed recipients to mail their checks to a
Mill Valley address, listed phone numbers for Wells Fargo Bank and
a law firm as contacts. The phones of both the bank and the law
firm of Nielsen, Merksamer, Parinello, Mueller and Naylor have been
ringing off the hook.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my estimation, those are the people who are calling the
shots'' for the governor, Keyser said. ``It's often a waste of time
to call Governor Wilson because he doesn't respond, but opening up
a dialogue with Nielsen, Merksamer and Wells Fargo gives us a much
greater chance of getting them to influence the governor in a
positive way.''
</P>
<P>
   James Parinello, a partner at Nielsen, Merksamer, said Keyser's
admission was news to him, although he was aware of the existence
of the AIDS Action League.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been some allusions to this, but there was never
anything that indicated bogus letters were going to be sent out,''
Parinello said.
</P>
<P>
   Had Keyser not identified himself as the sender of the bogus
letter _ both in a phone conversation and on the AIDS Action Web
site Thursday _ postal inspectors could have been stumped, because
the letters, mailed from Sacramento, were stamped, not metered. A
metered letter would have been easier to trace.
</P>
<P>
   Keyser, 56, who said he is the former owner-editor of the Battle
Mountain Bugle newspaper in Nevada, said: ``I want to personally
apologize to every one who received the letter for any
inconvenience it caused them ... But there is a larger issue
involved, and that's the issue of AIDS.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he was unconcerned about possible criminal action
against him as a result of the letters.
</P>
<P>
   ``This `bill' was addressed with an address such that I could
never receive any funds from this,'' he said. ``Absolutely in no
way could anyone say it's a (financial) fraud.''
</P>
<P>
   A Postal Service official said Keyser's actions did not appear
to be a violation of the federal mail fraud statute because it
wasn't done for self-wealth purposes.
</P>
<P>
   The Postal Service announced Tuesday that it had stopped all
mail from reaching the Mill Valley address and that whoever wanted
to claim it would have to do so in person. No one has claimed it.
</P>
<P>
   Keyser, who said he is neither gay nor infected with the AIDS
virus, said his motivation in sending out the letter was to ``have
people pick up the phone to call and complain.''
</P>
<P>
   Were the state to declare the state of medical emergency for
AIDS that he seeks, Keyser said, ``it would be a major breakthrough
in getting things done. It would put the issue in the hands of the
state Department of Health Services, which could institute clean
needle exchanges and override local school boards on matters of
health education.''

CLINTON'S TROUBLES CAST SHADOW ON GORE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (For release Sunday, Aug. 30) 
 
By CRAGG HINES 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The vice president's limousine pulled out of Sea
Charm Lane and turned, appropriately, into the fog.
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore's political destiny is shrouded in a mist with the
potential to be as thick, chill and menacing as the damp veil that
rolled across San Francisco as he emerged from a posh fund-raising
reception last week.
</P>
<P>
   Like many vice presidents before him, Gore is at the mercy of
the incumbent as well as political and economic factors largely
outside his control. The vice president is virtually on auto-pilot,
and, contended a top Democratic strategist: ``He's not even flying
his own plane.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's chances of winning the White House in 2000, agree
analysts from across the political spectrum, is chiefly in the
hands of President Clinton, Attorney General Janet Reno, Special
Counsel Kenneth Starr and even Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's sex scandal just accentuates the problem.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president's own troubles mounted with Reno's decision
last week to launch another 90-day inquiry into whether a special
prosecutor should be appointed to delve into his role in 1996
Democratic campaign fund raising. Gore claims he did nothing
improper, but a new independent counsel would almost certainly mean
an investigation lasting well into the 2000 campaign cycle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, Al, sorry,'' said Republican pollster Bill McInturff.
``You're not master of your own destiny. You are dependent on this
(Monica Lewinsky) story, the American economy. ... because you're
the third term for President Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   Pick a cliche for the overarching effect of Clinton on Gore's
political future, they're all being used _ joined at the hip,
lashed to the mast, stuck to the tar baby.
</P>
<P>
   Robert D. Squier, Gore's top political adviser, understands the
argument but doesn't see it as a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me what you have here is a Clinton-Gore
administration that is so popular because of the programs they have
fought for and have delivered on,'' Squier said. ``This basically
is an administration that said here is what we want to do with the
American economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Voters voted them in to do. They did it. They voted them back
in to continue it ...'' Squier said. ``That's a platform on which
Gore builds whatever he wants to build.''
</P>
<P>
   But the vice president's strategy probably cannot be that simple
and direct, contended George C. Edwards III, director of Texas A&AMP;M
University's Center for Presidential Studies.
</P>
<P>
   ``In an ideal world,'' Edwards said, ``Gore would have run on a
platform of `Let Us Continue' in 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the approach taken by Vice President George Bush when
he ran in 1992 and succeeded Ronald Reagan after two White House
terms that were viewed positively by a majority of Americans.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton's troubles ``make it more difficult to campaign like
that,'' Edwards said. ``Clinton is likely to be quiet ineffective
for the rest of his term, so `continue' what exactly?''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, as well as some Democrats, believe Gore and his
team may be putting too much faith in current polling that shows
Americans holding strongly favorable opinions of Clinton's job
performance while viewing the president personally with growing
distaste.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic campaign consultant Raymond Strother, who has
counseled Gore in the past, believes the vice president has ``his
own special set of problems.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Normally a vice president about this time has to separate
himself in some way from his president _ even a little,'' Strother
said. The need for Gore to appear loyal to scandal-plagued Clinton
as well as defend himself in the new fund-raising inquiry
complicates the process.
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;M's Edwards said Gore ``has got to be a contortionist'' as he
prepares for the 2000 presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got to be loyal, but he's got to create an independent
identity, and that's going to be a difficult task,'' Edwards said.
``I don't know how he's going to pull it off because (Gore and
Clinton) have been so very close.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1992 campaign, Bush tried to finesse the issue, broadly
promising to continue Reagan's agenda but pledging a ``kinder,
gentler'' administration with ``a thousand points of light.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Very nuanced,'' Edwards recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Gore would be very wise to try to distance
himself too far'' from Clinton, said former Sen. Alan Cranston,
D-Calif. ``It's hard to be disloyal and make it sell.''
</P>
<P>
   As things stand now, Gore seems little interested in putting any
daylight between himself and the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me say that I am proud of the leadership that President
Bill Clinton has brought to the United States of America,'' Gore
told well-heeled donors in a Pacific Heights mansion.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Democratic strategist said such sentiments are expected
_ at least by the party faithful _ from a vice president and that
Gore can say little more until Clinton decides whether he is going
to offer a fuller public explanation of his sexual relationship
with the former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards pointed out that Gore, despite Clinton's problems and
the new Reno inquiry, is not without formidable political
advantages, at least in terms of winning the Democratic nomination
in 2000. They include strong name recognition, a national political
organization and a tested, if now tainted, fund-raising ability.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's so far ahead of everyone else that he'll wipe them up ...
unless something really startling come out of this investigation,''
Edwards said. But he also noted: ``There's nothing good about
having your hand in the air'' to be sworn in for testimony to a
grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Strother is less sanguine about Gore's primary prospects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Democrats are very unpredictable,'' Strother said. ``We almost
knocked off a vice president, Mondale, with Gary Hart in 1984.''
</P>
<P>
   (Mondale had been defeated, along with President Carter, in the
1980 election. Vice presidents are not famous for directly
succeeding to the presidency by election. Bush was the first to
make it since Martin Van Buren won in 1836.)
</P>
<P>
   Another Democratic strategist pointed out that Gore has ``a
history and a problem'' in Iowa, where he pulled out of the
Democratic caucus process and condemned the key early test in a
1988 try for the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Were House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt, who won the Iowa
Democratic presidential caucuses in 1988, to run in 2000 and
``puncture (Gore's) vice-presidential aura, there could be a
problem,'' the Democratic strategist said.
</P>
<P>
   Strother said Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., might be a serious threat
to Gore because of his ``renegade'' outsider reputation and
demonstrated flair for criticizing Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Even with Gore's strong expressions of support for Clinton, it
seemed hardly an accident that the vice president was vacationing
in Hawaii on the night of Clinton's televised speech about his
personal transgressions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure he was sorry that Guam wasn't an American state and
he couldn't get farther away,'' McInturff said.
</P>
<P>
   And despite the Gore camp's belief that Clinton's sex scandal
does not directly damage the vice president, when Gore returned to
the mainland last week, his wife, Tipper, figured prominently in
his fund-raising stops and a town meeting on school violence.
</P>
<P>
   It was a clear reminder of what, by all accounts, is the Gores'
strong marriage and political partnership. As Tipper Gore entered
animatedly into the school violence discussion, Squier stood far to
the side, silently joining his thumb and forefinger to signal that
he thought her performance was A-OK.
</P>
<P>
   The Lewinsky case, a number of Democratic, Republican and
nonpartisan analysts agree, affects Gore only as it relates to
Clinton's overall standing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people can compartmentalize their view about Clinton, they
can easily differentiate between Clinton and Gore,'' said A&AMP;M's
Edwards.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does not connect to Al Gore, because it's not Al Gore's
behavior,'' said GOP pollster McInturff. ``There is no serious
conversation that Vice President Gore is anywhere near this story
or has conducted himself in a way that is close to this story.''
</P>
<P>
   McInturff, who has polled across the United States during the
last five presidential elections, said he is keeping his eye on
what some survey specialists believe is the most telling public
index, the question that asks prospective voters if they believe
the nation is on the right track or headed in the wrong direction.
</P>
<P>
   If the ``right track'' response remains strong, as it is today,
Gore has ``a very good shot at being the next president,''
McInturff said. If ``wrong track'' moves into the 60 or 70
percentage-point range, ``Gore is dead.''

BEAUTY'S BOMB, BUT HOW SMART? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.)   (For release Sunday, Aug. 30)  
(lb) 
 By ELLEN TIEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Once employed only in futuristic weapons,
cardiovascular surgery, CD players and other high-tech gadgets, the
laser has become the beauty industry's favorite new power tool.
Lasers are showing up in salon ads and dermatologist brochures,
promising to zap away unwanted body hair, wrinkles and leg veins.
But laser technology is developing so rapidly that it's difficult
for consumers to discern what is safe and effective.
</P>
<P>
   ``A laser is something you use to deliver a certain amount of
energy in order to destroy a precise target,'' Dr. David Biro, a
dermatologist in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, said. ``Like a smart bomb, it
selectively attacks a site without damaging any of the surrounding
tissue.''
</P>
<P>
   But the wrong machine in the wrong hands can cause burns, scar
dark skin or just annoy consumers, who pay for permanent removal of
hair only to see it grow back. Moreover, laser hair removal, tattoo
removal, facials and peels don't require a medical license; the
equipment can be deployed by anyone who has the $40,000 to $250,000
to buy it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone can buy a machine,'' Dr. Debra Jaliman, a prominent New
York dermatologist, said. ``But only a physician knows your medical
history and can prescribe antibiotics, if necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   But even doctors are finding that as lasers have become more
available, cosmetic dermatology has become a technology-driven
field. The public, told in ads and beauty magazines about the
promise of laser procedures, demands them; doctors and others are
drawn to laser procedures because they are lucrative. (Patients pay
$1,000 to $3,000 for the removal of hair on the upper lip; such
elective procedures are not covered by most medical insurers.)
</P>
<P>
   One concern is that some doctors might recommend a particular
laser to their patients because they have a commercial relationship
with the laser manufacturer. Four of the six doctors interviewed
for this article said they had been offered equipment free or at a
substantial discount in exchange for doing demonstrations or
research with the lasers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a standard industry practice,'' said Gary Weinstein,
the chairman of Thermo Lase Corp., which makes lasers. The doctors
interviewed said they had turned down the offers of free equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Some laser manufacturers run their own aesthetic treatment
centers. The Candela Laser Center in Boston is owned by Candela
Corp., which makes a range of lasers; the Candela Laser Center
employs doctors in the spa to perform treatments from facials and
peels to hair removal.
</P>
<P>
   Some doctors are hiring publicity agents conversant in
``chromophores'' and other laser lingo to promote their laser
treatments. Dermatologists have devised stylish promotions for
various beauty packages.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Tina Alster, a renowned laser specialist at the Washington
Institute for Skin Care in Washington, offers ``Vanity Visits'' _
one-hour consultations at which she designs personalized skin-care
regimens for patients and determines which products and procedures
are best. (As a bonus, patients receive an autographed copy of a
book she co-wrote, ``The Essential Guide to Cosmetic Laser
Surgery'' (Alliance Publishing, 1997).
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Steven Victor, an Upper East Side dermatologist, advertises
his laser peel as customized, so the energy level of the machine is
calibrated to the patient's unique nooks and crannies, but
theoretically all doctors should do this.
</P>
<P>
   And some dermatologists go even further, with brochures and
newsletters highlighting the latest, fastest, best laser
treatments. ``The hype and gimmickry are ridiculous,'' Ellen
Gendler, a Manhattan dermatologist, said. ``People are looking for
a quick fix, and these doctors are scrambling to give it to them.
Frankly, if I was forced to market myself that way, I'd rather quit
and go work in a shoe store.''

   With new laser machines coming out all the time, it can be
difficult for a consumer to sort out the facts. One of the newest
machines, the Coherent Lightsheer Diode Laser, is being promoted
for its ``cool-tip'' technology. The Lightsheer is used for hair
removal, and supposedly protects all skin tones from
laser-generated heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really is the most elegant little machine,'' said Dr.
Jaliman, whose tony uptown practice has treated such celebrity
dermis as Tina Turner, Geena Davis and Winona Ryder. For hair
removal, ``it has the longest wavelength, the deepest penetration,
and once you've done it three times, you've hit all the
follicles.'' She continued: ``It's safe for use during pregnancy
and on children. Not that I would necessarily advocate hair removal
on children.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Lightsheer laser seems packed with promise, to date
there have been no clinical studies published on its efficiency or
safety. Yet news releases trumpet that it achieves ``permanent''
hair removal; on July 28, the Food and Drug Administration, which
approves the use of these devices, cleared the product for hair
reduction, not permanent hair removal.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jim Baral of the American Dermatology Center in New York
said the Lightsheer ``has great potential, and it seems to work
well,'' but he was waiting for clinical studies on large groups.
</P>
<P>
   For now, he prefers the Soft Light laser (manufactured by Thermo
Lase Corp.) for hair removal. He also uses it for facials and
peels. ``Soft Light has been used the longest, has an incredible
safety record and works on any skin type,'' he said. ``With
strictly cosmetic procedures, it seems wisest to err on the
conservative side.''
</P>
<P>
   Other doctors point out that clinical studies show that hair
grows back the fastest with the Soft Light _ that is, within three
to six months after removal.
</P>
<P>
   As for other types of procedures, it seems each doctor has a
favorite laser. For facials and peels, Victor prefers the Erbium
laser. It is ``the most selective and causes no heat damage,'' he
said. Biro says he prefers the Ultrapulse for skin resurfacing,
which he calls ``the gold standard in skin resurfacing.''
</P>
<P>
   Where then do truth and beauty meet? Dr. Melanie Grossman,
director of clinical and laser research studies for the Laser and
Skin Surgery Center of New York, says that in the laser race
there's no clear front-runner. Dr. Grossman co-developed the
long-pulsed ruby-tip laser for hair removal at Massachusetts
General Hospital in Boston; the ruby-tip laser is designed for dark
hair on light skin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Choosing the right treatment ultimately depends on skin type,
hair color and the energy levels being produced,'' Dr. Grossman
said. She is currently conducting research on the newest generation
of lasers, the diodes like the Lightsheer.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Grossman and others agree that the most important thing for
a patient is to choose a doctor with care. As Biro put it, ``Would
you rather ride the newest, fanciest bus, or be with the most
trustworthy bus driver?''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, as the beauty smart bombs continue to drop, the
waxers, electrologists and facialists across the country will
undoubtedly start to lose business. On the horizon: laser
manicures, pedicures, stretch-mark removal, cellulite reduction and
permanent hair eradication in a single session.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lasers are going to take over,'' Victor said. ``Once
technology advances further and the prices come down, there's no
contest.''

VISITING THE HIGH-TECH WORLD OF AUTO DESIGN 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Your next car is being designed by mathematicians _ number
crunchers who spend long hours bending things, inventing computer
models, and wade gleefully through miles of printouts to perfect
the widgets and whatsits that go into a modern car. To me, at
least, there is some fun in this boring work; the lab has moved
onto the track.
</P>
<P>
   I spent a fruitful afternoon at Ford's Technical Center in
Dearborn, Mich., last week watching the crunchers crunch and
participating in some on-the-track testing exercises. The
demonstration pitted a new Mercury Cougar against a Mitsubishi
Eclipse in the Lommel Lane Change, an exercise named for Ford's
test center in Belgium. Both cars are wired, instrumented, and
equipped with a high-tech addition to the steering wheel to measure
driver input precisely.
</P>
<P>
   Lasers mounted on the car establish a reference plane parallel
with the driving surface, and computers record every deviation,
every twitch of the chassis. At 40 miles per hour through the
course, my seat-of-the-pants sense was that the Cougar was flatter
through the hard turns, exhibited less body roll, and, therefore,
could make it through the course somewhat faster than the Eclipse.
</P>
<P>
   The generous array of computer printouts and graphs depicting my
runs through the course verified that my seat-of-the-pants sense
was on target that day _ measurements don't lie.
</P>
<P>
   And then it occurred to me _ just who or what is being tested
here? Were the media reps participating being evaluated to to
establish a baseline against which to judge their car reviews?
Instead of merely saying that so-and-so doesn't know what he is
talking about, will Ford have a data base to prove it?
</P>
<P>
   The engineers I dumped this on looked at first shocked, then
amused _ apparently they hadn't thought of that yet. But then,
journalists naturally seem to have a conspiratorial bent in their
thinking. And now that we've brought it up ....
</P>
<P>
   Your columnist will delve deeper into the complexity of car
design in future episodes of Automobilia; knowing what the
engineers can achieve should give the consumer some insight into
what he/she should be looking to find in a car.

   There are giants among us whose labors go largely unnoticed in
the clamor of everyday life _ until suddenly they are no longer
there. Such was Carl S. Amsley, 77, of St. Thomas, Pa., who died in
his sleep a week ago today.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Amsley? Not exactly a household word in the automotive
world but something of a legend in the steam automobile fraternity,
a virtual deity among owners of Stanley Steamers _ Amsley bought,
sold, owned, repaired, or rebuilt more Stanleys than any other man
perhaps since the Stanley twins packed in the business in the
1920s, but at least since Fred Marriott closed his shop in the
'50s.
</P>
<P>
   Amsley was one of the few keepers of the steam automotive flame
in a world focused on V-8s. In the words of Susan S. Davis,
director of the Stanley Museum, ``When steam technology and
Stanleys were falling through the cracks, Amsley was guarding those
cracks.''
</P>
<P>
   I first met Amsley in 1984 on a trip to Kingfield, Maine, to
find out what was up with a fledgling Stanley Museum and see what
steam cars were all about. Amsley was standing in the doorway of a
barn on Stanley Avenue, taking shelter from a shower, beer in hand,
a broad smile on his face as he whipped out a business card
proclaiming ``Stanley Sales &AMP; Service.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the only Stanley dealer still in business,'' he announced.
And he never did stop selling Stanleys _ the car, the idea, the
legend.
</P>
<P>
   ``You ever ridden in a Stanley?'' he finally asked me, and, upon
getting a negative reply, led me to a car sitting in the museum
parking lot, an early ``coffin nose'' with a mother-in-law seat
behind the driver and passenger seats. The car smelled of burning
oil, diffusing heat, hissing oh so slightly as it stood ready, its
pilot light maintaining steam pressure in the boiler. We climbed
aboard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hold this,'' he said as he thrust the still full bottle into
my hand, opened the throttle, and sent the car chuffing through the
streets of Kingfield. As Amsley warmed to his task, the steamer
picked up real speed, a somewhat scary experience for the
uninitiated clinging to a seat sans seatbelt, perched high off the
street in this open antique.
</P>
<P>
   ``Watch this,'' said Amsley, beaming, as he missed a station
wagon by about a coat of paint and sent the Stanley sliding across
the museum parking lot up on two wheels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, what do you think about Stanleys now?'' he asked. I
countered with a question.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you always drive your car like that?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hell no,'' he roared back. ``This ain't my car.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, it wasn't, not that day, anyway. But if he hadn't owned it
at some time, you can bet he had worked on it. A contractor by
trade, Amsley began an affair with steam in the 1950s when steamers
were a drag on the market, mostly junkers for sale cheap. Amsley
traded, bought, sold, learned, built, proselytized, taught steam
and steamers. He invented a new class of car, the ``sweepings,'' a
car assembled from random collections of Stanley parts with a few
new pieces thrown in.
</P>
<P>
   Amsley became the source, the resident expert, and butt of many
a joke _ he was frequently credited with keeping 500 of the 400 or
so remaining Stanleys running, a reference to his building cars
from odd parts.
</P>
<P>
   But, that's exactly why he was important; he kept Stanleys
running. Amsley was a force for the automotive hobby. If some of
his cars can be criticized in the light of current-day restoration
and provenance standards, there is still ample cause to praise him
for keeping them in existence and plenty of reason to praise his
craftsmanship. When few people cared about steam, Amsley was the
person to whom those few turned for parts, cars, service, help, and
enthusiastic encouragement.
</P>
<P>
   The Stanley Museum has become the center of focus for the steam
hobby, a clearinghouse for those seeking expertise, cars, parts, or
just information. Interest in steam and Stanleys has grown
exponentially in the last 10 years. Amsley was a charter member and
enthusiastic supporter of the museum. Several who knew him have
established a memorial fund in his name at the museum _ you can
write to the Stanley Museum, Box 280, Kingfield, ME 04947 or
telephone 207-265-2729 for details.
</P>
<P>
   Amsley's middle name wasn't Stanley, but it might as well have
been. He left quite a legacy.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Industry bible Automotive News reports that General Motors is
now pressuring its suppliers for discounts _ in cash. Up front. Is
this the action of a company serious about cutting costs _ or is
this the symptom of a cash-strapped company in dire straits?
</P>
<P>
   The General has also terminated any effort to acquire Kia, the
ailing Korean car company. GM has been courting Korean firms for a
long time, once had a partnership with Daewoo _ remember the
subcompact Tracer? But the talk continues of closing old factories
and building new ones.
</P>
<P>
   So, how much did GM lose in the strike? And just how cash-short
is the General?

FROM THE DIANAPHILES TO THE HILLARY-PHOBES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Random comments on people in the news:
</P>
<P>
   PRINCESS DIANA: Still dead. Still in the news. It's only a
matter of time until we hear reports of a Diana sighting at
Wal-Mart.
</P>
<P>
   Princess Diana, a k a the Queen of Hearts, was killed one year
ago Monday in a Paris car crash, touching off one of the most
bizarre bouts of media hysteria in the history of celebrity
worship. Just about every network and cable news programs seemed to
be broadcasting on The Diana Channel _ all Diana, all the time.
Anyone who had the audacity to suggest that the breathless news
coverage was overdone was rudely shouted down by the Dianaphiles.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a year later, we're being buried in enough tributes,
retrospectives and reflections on her death to keep a dozen Diana
Channels on the air.
</P>
<P>
   Even more amazing: French authorities are still investigating
that fatal car crash. Who do you suppose is heading up this inquiry
_ Inspector Clouseau?
</P>
<P>
   AL GORE: Just what we need _ another independent counsel, this
time to investigate the vice president's fund-raising phone calls
during the 1996 campaign. Didn't Attorney General Janet Reno look
into this once before, only to decide that no further investigation
was needed?
</P>
<P>
   Sure she did. Way last year. But now she's been confronted with
new evidence that didn't turn up in the original inquiry. Gore
faces a 90-day preliminary review that could turn into a
full-fledged investigation if the new evidence pans out.
</P>
<P>
   It makes sense. If President Clinton should be impeached and
tossed out of office, we wouldn't want President Gore running
around the White House without an independent counsel nipping at
his heels, would we?
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton: The Hillary-haters keep insisting that
the first lady must have known all along that her husband cheated
on her with former White House intern Monica Lewinksy. All those
months that Hillary spent defending the First Philanderer, her
critics say, were obviously nothing but a con job by a woman who
will say or do anything to prop up her no-good mate because she's
more concerned about power and position than about marital
fidelity.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe. But when the first couple went off on vacation with their
daughter walking between them, they looked for all the world like a
pair of married folks who had just gone toe-to-toe over the brand
of marital malfeasance that turns a spouse into a wild-eyed
terrorist _ especially if the transgressor has been lying about his
transgression. Hillary can't be that good an actress.
</P>
<P>
   E.G. MARSHALL: As long as we're talking about acting, we might
as well talk about a man who did it as well as anybody and better
than most. E.G. Marshall wasn't exactly a household name, but he
spent plenty of time in America's households over the years as he
delivered some of the finest TV acting ever.
</P>
<P>
   He starred in one of the very first realistic legal dramas on
television, ``The Defenders,'' and also excelled in movies and
Broadway plays. When he died the other day at the age of 88 (or 84,
depending on the source), we lost a brilliant actor who brought
elegance and class to every performance.
</P>
<P>
   MARK MCGWIRE: There are still a fair number of classy actors
around, even in this era of overpaid, under-talented movie stars.
But a class act in professional sports is a rarity _ which makes
McGwire that much more of a national treasure. McGwire is chasing
major-league baseball's record for most home runs in a season and
thus has fallen prey to bottom-fishing media types who live for the
thrill of discrediting a hero.
</P>
<P>
   But even in the face of a phony scandal about his use of a
strength-building substance that is perfectly legal, McGwire has
remained gracious, polite and humble. This is a man who donates
significant amounts of time and money to charity _ most notably to
victims of child abuse _ and who prevailed on the St. Louis
Cardinals to let his son work as a batboy so that dad and kid could
spend as much time together as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not McGwire breaks the record, he's a Hall of Fame
athlete and a Hall of Fame human being.

 &HT;    Mini reviews of current movies
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel and Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Reviewer's initials appear at end of review). Grades range from
A to F.
</P>
<P>
   Air Bud: Golden Receiver G
</P>
<P>
   If you're younger than 8, this ``Bud's'' for you. In this sequel
to ``Air Bud,'' Buddy, the hoop-shooting golden retriever, and his
boy, Josh (Kevin Zegers) trade basketball for football. Scriptwise,
it's little more than a glorified after-school special, but there
hasn't been much around for younger kids recently and it handles
its messages well. And so what if the movie is essentially a series
of Stupid Pet Tricks? In his K-9 jersey, pads and helmet, Buddy
looks more athletically heroic than Bruce Willis. 1 hour, 31
minutes. (ER) Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Armageddon PG-13
</P>
<P>
   The world, interpreted as a video game. While ``Deep Impact''
treated a similar let's-save-Earth story with sobriety,
``Armageddon'' never lets the threat of global annihilation get in
the way of fun. It's a space-cowboy movie, with Bruce Willis and
Ben Affleck saving the world for Liv Tyler. As a summer popcorn
movie, it's more enjoyable than that big-lizard flick ``Godzilla.''
And you'll see the reported $165 million budget onscreen in the
impressive effects and mammoth sets. But is the movie good for you?
Probably not. Rated PG-13 for sci-fi disaster action, implied sex
and profanity. 2 hours, 24 minutes. (SM)
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   The Avengers PG
</P>
<P>
   At least visually, this update of the '60s British TV series
pays witty homage to the original's vein of Carnaby Street
surrealism. In between sips of champagne and civilized quips,
secret agents John Steed (Ralph Fiennes) and Mrs. Emma Peel (Uma
Thurman) foil criminals plotting against the British government.
But there are two main problems: a half-baked script and Thurman,
who is trumped by the cool, feline memory of Diana Rigg, who
originated the role. (SM) Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss R
</P>
<P>
   Harmless, mildly entertaining and completely disposable, this is
the movie equivalent of Richard Simmons. A cute, funny,
romantically minded photographer named Billy (Sean P. Hayes) falls
for a gorgeous hunk (Brad Rowe) who may or may not be gay, but who
keeps himself tantalizingly available. (Though for what? Friendship
or love?) Rated R for language, sex and drug references. 1 hour, 32
minutes. (ER) Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   Blade R
</P>
<P>
   Doesn't cut it. Wesley Snipes stars as the half-vampire,
half-human hero who can handle sunlight but also has a taste for
blood. Armed with an arsenal of sci-fi gadgets, a really cool
leather coat and Kris Kristofferson (a kind of high-tech Gabby
Hayes), Blade is devoted to wiping out all vampires. Especially a
strutting blood-sucker played by Stephen Dorff. Alas, all the
non-stop slash 'n' gnash action beomes more repetitive than
anything else. Rated R for extreme violence and strong language. 2
hours. (ER) Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   Dance With Me PG
</P>
<P>
   A guilty, quick-stepping pleasure. Vanessa L. Williams plays a
Houston dance instructor who hopes to recapture past dance
competition glory with the help of a Cuban newcomer (Latin music
star Chayanne). Original it isn't, but ``Dance'' is great fun. It's
the first film that lets Williams show off her knockout dancing,
and in his first Hollywood flick, Chayanne goes for the summer's
heart-
</P>
<P>
   throb title. 2 hours, 6 minutes. (SM) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Dead Man on Campus R
</P>
<P>
   Some passable laughs, but it doesn't make the honor roll. Two
college students (Tom Everett Scott and Mark-Paul Gosselaar) hope a
kamikaze frat boy (Lochlyn Munro), will share their dorm suite.
And, preferably, kill himself in one of his misadventures. That's
because an odd clause at their college gives students an automatic
4.0 average if their roommate offs himself. Rated R for drug use,
language and crude sexual humor. At metro theaters. 1 hour, 36
minutes. (SM) Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Dolittle PG-13
</P>
<P>
   This raucous but uninspired Eddie Murphy vehicle has almost
nothing to do with the old Rex Harrison musical. Murphy is John
Dolittle, a busy doctor who has neglected his wife (Kristen Wilson)
and his two daughters. One day, all kinds of animals start
pestering him vocally. Despite the zing of some nuttier moments,
the lame plot keeps dragging the movie to the ground. Rated PG-13
for crude humor and language. 1 hour, 30 minutes. (SM) Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Ever After PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Happily, this ``Ever After'' proves you can teach an old doll
new tricks. Re-inventing the Cinderella story in a way that targets
``Titanic''-loving teens more than Barney grads, the movie stars
Drew Barrymore as its spirited heroine, Anjelica Huston as her
scheming stepmother and Dougray Scott as a prince who's more than
just another trophy husband. Jeanne Moreau, doyenne of the French
New Wave, contributes a classy cameo. Rated PG-13 for emotional
situations (death of a father) and some violence. 2 hours. (ER)
Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Everest NR
</P>
<P>
   Breathtaking. Even filmgoers accustomed to the five-story IMAX
format may gasp at the unearthly scale of ``Everest.'' This
44-minute documentary was filmed at the same time as the 1996 storm
that killed eight mountain climbers, memorialized by Jon Krakauer's
best-selling book ``Into Thin Air.'' Cameraman David Breashears
fills the screen with awesome vistas, but discreetly avoids the
piles of discarded oxygen tanks, human waste and frozen bodies that
now litter the trails of the mountain. This is a film whose cruel
beauty manages to celebrate the spirit of the climbers, while
making you question their sanity. (SM)
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   54 R
</P>
<P>
   The Manhattan nightclub Studio 54 was a late '70s blast of
neo-Roman decadence where everyone could be fabulous.
Unfortunately, writer-director Mark Christopher gives us a tired,
creaky fable about a small-town stud (Ryan Phillippe) who gets
seduced by the limelight, almost loses himself but gets saved by
the right girl. The movie is as meek as Studio 54 was outrageous.
Rated R for sexuality, profanity, drug use. 1 hour, 33 minutes.
(SM) Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   Godzilla PG-13
</P>
<P>
   He's back. He's big. He's boring. There was probably no way
Hollywood's extravagant update of ``Godzilla'' could live up to its
year-long hype. What's depressing is how far it falls short from
being even solid summer escapism. Bikini Atoll resident Godzilla
comes to nest in Manhattan when it's time to think of family
matters. Matthew Broderick is a biologist on the monster's trail.
Rated PG-13 for sci-fi action/violence. 2 hours, 19 minutes. (SM)
Grade: C-
</P>
<P>
   The Governess R
</P>
<P>
   Where's Mary Poppins when you need her? In the 1840s, a young
Jewish woman (Minnie Driver) poses as a Christian in order to
secure a job with a wealthy family on a remote Scottish island and
help her own debt-stricken family. The film tries to deliver a
treatise on religious bigotry plus a dollop of feminism within the
context of a fevered bodice-ripper. What evolves is an over-busy
movie with under-realized potential. Rated R for sexual scenes and
nudity. 1 hour, 54 minutes. (ER) Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   Halloween: H20 R
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Lee Curtis returns in this unsurprising 20th anniversary
sequel to John Carpenter's 1978 frightfest ``Halloween.'' Now,
she's a single mom to 17-year-old John (Josh Hartnett). Also back
is Michael Myers, the maniac who stalked Curtis all those years
ago. You can easily guess who'll survive and who'll get cut out of
the picture, literally. But when Curtis pulls a Sigourney Weaver, a
la ``Aliens,'' stalking Michael instead of fleeing him, the movie
finally gets some juice. Rated R for profanity, violence, gore,
alcohol use. 1 hour, 22 minutes. (SM)
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   How Stella Got Her Groove Back R
</P>
<P>
   The screen version of Terry McMillan's novel tries to distract
us from its lack of plot with visual opulence. Angela Bassett plays
a fortysomething investment banker who takes a trip to Jamaica with
her best pal (Whoopi Goldberg), where she falls for a 20-year-old
local (Taye Diggs). Luckily, Bassett roots the picture with a
glowing performance, sharing with us Stella's unexpected moments of
emotional rediscovery. Rated R for sexual situations, nudity,
language. 2 hours, 4 minutes. (SM)
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Lethal Weapon 4 R
</P>
<P>
   The latest in director Richard Donner's cheerfully chaotic
blow-em-up series re-pairs Mel Gibson's hothead cop Riggs, and
Danny Glover's long-suffering partner Murtaugh. Shaggy and amiable,
Number 4 hardly bothers to get its real plot going for its first
hour. More than ever, the film is an excuse to give its crack
supporting cast, including Joe Pesci and Chris Rock, a series of
comic riffs. Rated R for violence and profanity. 2 hours, 5
minutes. (SM) Grade: B

   A remarkably faithful and fun adaptation of the beloved series
of children's books about a precocious redheaded orphan living in a
girls school. Set in the relatively uncomplicated 1950s and
breathtakingly filmed in Paris, it's fast-paced enough to appeal to
kids (even little boys should take to the motor scooter-riding
rascal Pepito) and just nostalgic enough for adults. Rated PG for
comic violence. 1 hour, 29 minutes* (Jill Vejnoska) Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   The Mask of Zorro PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Derring-do done right. Our men in black are Anthony Hopkins and
Antonio Banderas who double our swashbuckling pleasure and double
our fun as fual Zorros, saving California and Hopkins' beautful,
spirited daughter (stunning newcomer, Catherine Zeta-Jones) from
the evil schemes of one Don Rafael (Stuart Wilson). It's an expert
blend of panache, romanticism and supple, tongue-in-cheek humor.
Rated PG-13 for violence. 2 hours, 16 minutes. (ER) Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   Mulan G
</P>
<P>
   The best Disney animated feature since ``Beauty and the Beast''
and ``The Lion King.'' Based on a fourth-century legend, it's about
a young girl who pulls a National Velvet, i.e., disguises herself
as a boy and goes to battle in her elderly father's place. This
isn't just a grand family film; it's a grand film, period. As Eddie
Murphy's little red dragon says, ``Mulan, you the man!'' 1 hour, 28
minutes. (ER) Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   The Negotiator R
</P>
<P>
   In this crisply acted thriller, Samuel L. Jackson plays a
hostage negotiator for the Chicago police department who is framed
for embezzlement and murder. Desperate to clear his name, he takes
four members of the department hostage, then asks another
negotiator (Kevin Spacey) to act as a mediator between himself and
his fellow officers. The film's main kick is the engrossing duel of
bluffs and counterbluffs between Spacey and Jackson. Rated R for
violence and profanity. 2 hours, 15 minutes. (SM) Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Next Stop, Wonderland R
</P>
<P>
   A small wonder in its own modest way. This charming low-budget
romantic comedy about the relationship travails of a Boston nurse
(Hope Davis) is stronger on character nuance than on plot; in fact,
filmmaker Brad Anderson loads it with too much plot. But by
applying a naturalistic independent-film sensibility to a vintage
glossy-Hollywood predicament, he comes out ahead. Think of a film
where John Cassavetes shares pillow talk with Doris Day. Rated R
for vulgar language and sexual situations. 1 hour, 36 minutes. (ER)
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   The Opposite of Sex R
</P>
<P>
   Christina Ricci's teen tart burns across the screen in this
acerbic yet strangely sweet black comedy. The convoluted plot kicks
off when Ricci visits her gay half-brother (Martin Donovan) and
steals his dim-bulb lover (Ivan Sergei). The eclectic (and fine)
supporting cast includes Lisa Kudrow and Lyle Lovett. Rated R for
vulgar language, sexual situations, some nudity and sexual
references. 1 hour, 40 minutes. (ER)
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   The Parent Trap PG
</P>
<P>
   Wisely deviates little from the plot of the 1961 Disney film
that made 15-year-old Hayley Mills a big star. This time Lindsay
Lohan plays the dual role of separated-practically-at-birth
identical twins who meet and switch identities in the hopes of
reuniting their divorced parents. Fax machines and ``Leo'' DiCaprio
references dot this modernized tale. Young kids may fidget at the
length and several kissing scenes. Rated PG for mild profanity and
alcohol use. 2 hours, 7 minutes. (Jill Vejnoska)
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Passion in the Desert PG-13
</P>
<P>
   A desert reverie about the bond between man and beast. In the
late 18th century, an officer in Napoleon's army get separated from
the rest of the troop and wanders through the Egyptian desert until
he finds refuge in some ancient ruins. His sole companion? A lithe,
solitary, potentially man-eating leopard. A striking, strangely
lyrical, daringly original film about discovering your inner
cat-person. Rated PG-13 for violence and nudity. 1 hour, 33
minutes. (ER) Grade: B+

<P>
   Warning to anyone whose math paranoia dates back to eighth-grade
algebra: Darren Aronovsky has your number(s). In his technically
and intellectually brilliant film, a solitary math prodigy (Sean
Gulette) stumbles onto a number that could be the key to everything
unknowable in the universe, be it the stock market or God. Named
best director at the Sundance Film Festival, Aronovsky is clearly a
talent to be watched; hopefully, next time, he'll wed his head-trip
images to a more involving script. Rated R for vulgar language and
grotesque violence. 1 hour, 25 minutes. (ER) Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Return to Paradise R
</P>
<P>
   Hardly paradise. Three guys party hard together in Malaysia. Two
(Vince Vaughn, David Conrad) return home and find out, two years
later from a lawyer (Anne Heche), that the third (Joaquin Phoenix)
has been jailed on drug charges since they left and will be hanged
in eight days unless they return to share the responsibility. But
that also means sharing the jail time. It's a terriifc,
what-would-you-do moral dilemma that's squandered by an inept
script. Rated R for language, drug references and a brief sex
scene. 1 hour, 49 minutes. (ER) Grade: C-
</P>
<P>
   Saving Private Ryan R
</P>
<P>
   Part gung-ho heroism, part in-your-face horror show, Steven
Spielberg's superb film shows us World War II as we've never seen
it before. Tom Hanks leads a courageous squad (and excellent
ensemble cast) on a mission to find a private (Matt Damon) whose
three brothers have already been killed in combat. Hanks'
performance is a miracle of decency and subtle emotion, but kudos
all around here. And the opening D-Day sequence is the most
powerful combat footage ever created on film. Rated R for extreme
violence and some vulgar language. 2 hours, 50 minutes. (ER) Grade:
A
</P>
<P>
   Slums of Beverly Hills R
</P>
<P>
   A vivid, very funny look at coming of age on the fringes. Vivian
Abramowitz (Natasha Lyonne) is the odd girl out in a post-divorce
family led by a father (Alan Arkin) who, every three months or so,
skips out on rent and moves his brood to another fleabag on the
edge of Beverly Hills. Director Tamara Jenkins re-creates the daily
humiliations of adolescence with wince-inducing accuracy. And
Lyonne is terrific at navigating the waters of teen angst. Rated R
for nudity, profanity, sexual situations. 1 hour, 31 minutes. (SM)
Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   Smoke Signals PG-13
</P>
<P>
   A bittersweet coming-of-age comedy about two Native Americans
who leave their dilapidated reservation to go to Arizona to fetch
their father's (one biological; the other spiritual) ashes.
Rambling and rough around the edges, with a honed casualness that
suggests the early '70s, Chris Eyre's debut film is still
definitely worth a look. Rated PG-13 for vulgar language and
alcohol abuse. 1 hour, 30 minutes. (ER) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Snake Eyes R
</P>
<P>
   Oscar-winner Nicolas Cage and Brian De Palma are always worth
gambling on; while they don't come up total winners here, they're
hardly losers either. Cage plays a crooked Atlantic City cop who
finds himself in the middle of an assassination plot during a
heavyweight boxing match. Part detective story, part
action-thriller, the picture loses steam near the end, but De
Palma's wired camerawork and Cage's strutting energy help hold it
together. Rated R for violence and language. 1 hour, 42 minutes.
(ER) Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   There's Something About Mary R
</P>
<P>
   Rude, crude and hilarious, this comedy by the ``Dumb &AMP; Dumber''
team of Peter and Bobby Farrelly definitely isn't a family film.
Ben Stiller plays Ted, a nerdy high school senior who suffers a
very particular bathroom mishap that keeps him from attending his
prom with the class golden girl (Cameron Diaz). Thirteen years
later, he hires a lower-rung gumshoe (Matt Dillon) to track her
down. The movie is liberating in its scatological, slapstick way.
But the easy-to-offend should find something more polite to watch.
Rated R for strong comic sexual content and language. 1 hour, 58
minutes. (SM) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   The Thief R
</P>
<P>
   This Russian fable of fathers and sons will steal into your
heart. In 1952, as Stalin inflicts his style of ``paternalism'' on
the Soviet Union, a 6-year-old boy and his young widowed mom are
wooed by a charming soldier (Vladmir Mashkov) who isn't what he
seems. As allegories go, this one's pretty transparent. But the
film's considerable strength lies in its poetic vignettes, telling
visual details and three wonderful performances. A 1997 Oscar
nominee for best foreign-language film. Rated R for sex, nudity and
language. Subtitles. 1 hour, 30 minutes. (ER) Grade: A-

   The Truman Show PG
</P>
<P>
   Jim Carrey's excellent performance is the centerpiece of this
provocative, thoroughly entertaining social satire about a cheerful
insurance salesman who slowly realizes his entire life has been a
TV show and everyone he knows are actors. Peter Weir directs this
dazzlingly executed conceit and the strong cast includes Laura
Linney and Ed Harris. Rated PG for mild language. 1 hour, 44
minutes. (ER) Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   Why Do Fools Fall in Love R
</P>
<P>
   This dark, dramatic biopic stars Halle Berry, Vivica A. Fox and
Lela Rochon as the women who were married to doo-wopper Frankie
Lymon, and whose court fight over his royalty ``estate'' clues us
to the singer's sorry life. Boasting some great late '50s and early
'60s rock sounds, this film, unfortunately, spins back and forth
narratively. The high note of this affectionate production is in
the performances. Rated R for language, sex scenes and drug use. 2
hours, 3 minutes. (Hollywood Reporter) Grade: B

   Wrongfully Accused PG-13
</P>
<P>
   The sultan of spoof, Leslie Nielsen (``Airplane!'' ``The Naked

   Your Friends &AMP; Neighbors R
</P>

   With friends (and neighbors) like these. ... Neil LaBute, who
did the lacerating ``In the Company of Men,'' suffers a sophomore
slump of sorts in this black comedy about sex games and power plays
among six thirtysomething urbanites, some paired off, some not. The
movie is smart, funny and cynical, but never as smart, funny and
cynical as it thinks it is. The result is less like first-rate Neil
LaBute than second-rung Woody Allen. Rated R for sex and language.
1 hour, 45 minutes. (ER) Grade: C+

WILSON MAY TAP DEPARTING SENATOR FOR JUDGESHIP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT SALLADAY and RACHEL GORDON  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ Gov. Pete Wilson is considering a gift to
departing state Sen. Quentin Kopp of San Francisco _ a judgeship on
the Sonoma County Superior Court.
</P>
<P>
   The position is tied up in politics in the final days of the
legislative session, which ends at midnight Monday. Wilson, a
Republican, has asked the Democratic-controlled Legislature to fund
40 new judgeships throughout the state.
</P>
<P>
   Sources say Wilson is considering Kopp to fill a judicial
position mapped out for the Northern California county.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, however, are uncomfortable giving Wilson any new
appointments just months before he leaves office. Therefore, they
are demanding concessions in exchange, including a pay raise for
state employees.
</P>
<P>
   Kopp, an independent, would not confirm Thursday whether he had
been approached by the governor's office. However, he said, ``I
would not rule out a judicial appointment.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson spokesman Sean Walsh, said: ``Senator Kopp has a sharp
legal mind, is a person of great substance and depth and has the
character and acumen to make a wonderful judge. If indeed he does
have a desire to be a judge, we would be happy to take a close
look.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sonoma County judge's seat would be for a six-year term. If
Kopp wanted to remain after that, he would have to go before
voters.
</P>
<P>
   Kopp, 70, must leave the Legislature this year because of term
limits.
</P>
<P>
   A conservative with populist appeal, Kopp has said that once he
leaves office, he intends to step up his law practice and continue
his weekly political commentary on a local television station. His
chief goal, he said, is to qualify a statewide initiative for a
quarter-cent sales tax to fund a high-speed rail line between San
Francisco and Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   A Harvard Law School-educated lawyer who tries a couple of cases
a year, Kopp also has said he might go back into full-time law
practice with his son, Shepherd, an assistant public defender in
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   He did not rule out the possibility of running for mayor in San
Francisco.

SEVERAL LATIN LEADERS LAUNCH CONSTITUTIONAL EFFORTS TO STAY IN
POWER 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: This is sider with Panama-President) 
 
By JOHN OTIS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PANAMA CITY, Panama _ President Ernesto Perez Balladares isn't
the only Latin American leader who has been reluctant to clean out
his desk.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Menem of Argentina, Fernando Henrique Cardoso of Brazil
and Alberto Fujimori of Peru have all engineered constitutional
amendments allowing them to run for immediate re-election. Thanks
to political maneuvering last week, Fujimori, who won a second term
in 1995, might seek a third term in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Critics warn that Latin American governments lack credible
checks and balances and that several years in power can turn
democrats into autocrats. But others say that voters have simply
rewarded accomplished chief executives for good work.
</P>
<P>
   ``This trend is related to good management,'' said a South
American diplomat. ``Efficient governments have earned the right to
continue.''
</P>
<P>
   For much of this century, Latin America was ruled by brutal
dictators and corrupt civilian ``caudillos'' who stayed in power
through military backing or electoral shenanigans.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican Revolution was launched in 1910, in part, because
President Porfirio Diaz arranged to have himself elected six times
over 34 years. ``No re-election'' was one of the revolution's
rallying cries.
</P>
<P>
   Despite regular elections in Nicaragua, the Somoza clan clung to
power for 43 years. Anastasio Somoza Debayle, the last of the
family rulers, was finally ousted in 1979 by Sandinista guerrillas
_ who promptly set up their own authoritarian regime led by
brothers Humberto and Daniel Ortega.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been some exceptions but, in general, re-election
is poison for democracy,'' said Bolivar Parientes, an opposition
Panamanian congressman.
</P>
<P>
   When dictators gave way to civilian leaders across much of the
region in the 1980s, most presidents were constitutionally required
to step down after one term.
</P>
<P>
   By then, Nicaraguans had become so wary of family dynasties that
they wouldn't even allow distant relatives of the president to seek
the office.
</P>
<P>
   Public opinion has only recently begun to shift with the
emergence of a handful of dynamic civilian leaders who have led
their nations out of crises.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s, Menem, Cardoso and Fujimori tamed hyperinflation,
stabilized the monetary system and brought galloping economic
growth to Argentina, Brazil and Peru. Fujimori dealt a crushing
blow to Peru's Sendero Luminoso rebel movement that had waged a
terrorist war against the state.
</P>
<P>
   All three leaders used their resulting political capital to push
through constitutional amendments allowing re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Warning that ``it's me or chaos,'' Menem went on to win a
landslide victory in 1995. Fujimori was returned to office with
more than three times the vote of his closest challenger. Cardoso,
who was first elected in 1994, is the front-runner going into
Brazil's first-round presidential vote in October.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you try to explain re-election in Argentina and Peru, you
have to take into account the extraordinary circumstances,'' said
Ricardo Arias Calderon, a former Panamanian vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Menem and Fujimori have demonstrated authoritarian
tendencies. Both maneuvered to extend their rule into the next
century.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori, in particular, has shown little patience for
democratic niceties. In 1992, he dealt with a corrupt legislature
and a growing rebel threat by dissolving Congress and declaring
one-man rule for eight months.
</P>
<P>
   Although Peru now has a semblance of constitutional rule, vast
powers remain in Fujimori's hands, and he seems reluctant to loosen
his grip. The courts are packed with the president's allies, and
the compliant Congress has approved laws with little debate.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Fujimori pushed through another constitutional
amendment that would allow him to seek a third consecutive
five-year term in 2000. Outraged opposition leaders called for a
citizen referendum on the issue, but the measure was blocked by the
pro-Fujimori Congress on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Menem considered further constitutional tinkering to pave the
way for a third term. But his popularity has fallen because of
rising unemployment. Last month, he announced that he would not run
in the 2000 election.
</P>
<P>
   Nations that don't allow re-election aren't necessarily more
democratic. Mexican presidents get just one six-year term. But
until very recently, Mexico was a virtual one-party state. The
Institutional Revolutionary Party has ruled the country since
1929. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; One diplomat pointed out that many Latin American nations
already have strong presidential systems. Rather than worrying
about the re-election of presidents, these countries should focus
on revamping their often corrupt and overworked legal systems and
strengthening their congresses.
</P>
<P>
   In Panama, for example, legislators lack staff and research
capabilities, making them dependent on the advice of the president
or their party's leaders. Lawmakers have little control over the
nation's budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``A good legal system would help tremendously. A real congress
would provide checks and balances,'' the diplomat said. ``But in
terms of improving things, re-election is not a priority.''

ONE RIDDLE FITS ALL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ala.)   (For release Sunday, Aug. 30)  
(lb) 
 By ALEX KUCZYNSKI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Let me begin by saying that I'm not a Lilly Pulitzer kind of
woman. But in July I found myself on Martha's Vineyard with an hour
on my hands, checked out the competition and thought, ``When in
Rome ....''
</P>
<P>
   I followed a group of women with sun-worn faces and plaid hair
bands into the closest boutique, and there I found it: a short,
flirty, flowered Lilly Pulitzer, printed with roses and frogs and
prancing children.
</P>
<P>
   The fit was miraculous, as if a team of steely-eyed couture
seamstresses had spent weeks plotting each angle and line and dip
of my body. I was ready to unburden myself of $130 when I stepped
out of the dress and saw the label. The magical phrase I read there
changed my life: size 6.
</P>
<P>
   I had unwittingly stumbled upon the holy grail of womanhood.
Sucking in my stomach, I decided to go for a size 4 plaid skirt.
The headband set listened as I struggled, wriggled and zipped. And
as a soft white light suffused the dressing room and the distant
strains of a divine choir (actually, it was Hanson) seemed to drift
past the swinging wicker doors, I took a long breath. Victory _
size 4 _ was mine.
</P>
<P>
   Women's apparel sizing is eternally mystifying. I am a
broad-shouldered athlete, close to 6 feet tall and weighing many,
many dozens of pounds. How I fit into a 6, the size of wraithlike
supermodels and desiccated society waifs who eat grapes for lunch,
or a positively puny size 4, is a riddle wrapped in an enigma
wrapped in, well, a size 4 wrap dress.
</P>
<P>
   And it's become a lightning-rod issue for American clothing
manufacturers. I described the incredible shrinking act to Dr.
Lenda Jo Anderson, a professor of consumer affairs at Auburn
University in Alabama, who at the behest of the Commerce Department
studies size in women's clothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We define ourselves in our minds by size, and designers play
to that notion,'' she said in a demure Southern accent. ``It makes
us feel good to fit into a 6, but it also makes us feel good to be
able to say to our friends that we fit into a size 6. But it can be
ridiculous. I bought a pair of pants by Carlisle in a size 0 the
other day. Who wears a size 0?'' (Dr. Anderson said she usually
wears a 4 or a 6.)
</P>
<P>
   The American Apparel Manufacturers Association studies the
subject, but Carl Priestland, the association's chief economist,
says it's not a simple problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sizing has been an issue for years simply because there are so
many companies out there making garments,'' he said. ``There are 7
billion garments consumed in the United States each year that
require care labeling. So it's nice and pretty to say we want a
standard for each and every piece.''
</P>
<P>
   Priestland said that each year U.S. manufacturers make 200
million dresses, 375 million pairs of jeans, 2.4 billion knit
shirts and 45 million dozen pairs of women's panties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you imagine?'' he said. ``Forty-five million dozen pairs
of women's panties?'' To be honest, I can't.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Anderson explained that American women's sizes originated in
the 1940s and '50s, when the Army, confronted with the enormous
task of outfitting tens of thousands of women for the first time,
tried to create a standard set of sizes. The chart that resulted,
outlining the 58 sizes for men and women was published by the
Bureau of Standards as Document 454.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, Document 454 is not taped to the refrigerator of
today's designers. Since the '40s, sizes have been shifting as
crazily as the San Andreas fault.
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce Department has founded the National Textile Center,
a consortium of colleges, to study the subject. The Air Force is
conducting a nationwide survey of American bodies to redefine the
standard body and size.
</P>
<P>
   And as more and more consumers buy clothing in the electronic
marketplace _ over the telephone or via the Internet _ Dr. Anderson
said, the problem becomes pronounced because consumers rely on
sizes, without actually trying on articles of clothing, to
determine what will fit them best. Companies like QVC report
returns of up to 50 percent on clothing because of poor fit, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   But aside from economic difficulties, there are psychological
ones. No woman who usually wears a 12 wants to go to her closet and
confront a row of stolid, round, pudgy black numbers that read 16
or 18 or 20.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Silence of the Lambs,'' the drag-queen killer always
chose young women who were size 14 _ and the only moviegoers who
remember that piece of trivia are women. And in certain female
quarters, the size of Monica Lewinsky's notorious off-the-rack
dress continues to inspire guessing games.
</P>
<P>
   I usually call myself a 10. But I've ordered shorts from J. Crew
that in a 10, without the tab pocket, are so loose I have to
duct-tape them to my body to keep them from falling off. Similar
shorts in the same size, with the tab pocket, are so tiny that I
have to grease myself like a watermelon on the Fourth of July in
order to slide them on.
</P>
<P>
   In noncatalog clothing, the discrepancies from designer to
designer are startling. Tahari makes a jacket that I _ a former
competitive swimmer with the shoulders of a Pittsburgh Steeler _
can wear only in a shrinky-dink 6. The skirt, on the other hand,
fits in an 8 (svelte), a 10 (poochy) or a 12 (nunlike).
</P>
<P>
   A benevolent aunt gave me a Mary McFadden couture dress in an 8,
and it is broad in the beam. Country Road makes wool pants that fit
beautifully in an 8, and viscose pants in the same cut that in a 10
fit like swaddling clothes.
</P>
<P>
   I wear a sample-size 8 in the famously revived Diane Von
Furstenburg wrap dress, and a 16 _ gasp! _ in a vintage dress from
the 1950s. (Sizes have shifted so much in the last four decades
that every woman loves to crow about how Marilyn Monroe wore a 14.
But that was back in the days when a 14 was really an 8, so button
your lip.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very upsetting,'' said one friend who tried on a
too-tight skirt in a size 14 at Agnes B. ``Even the salesclerk was
consoling me.''
</P>
<P>
   When men shop, they are not permitted to toy with their psyches
the way women do and to plot elaborate mazes of self-delusion.
Rather than playing a psychological shell game every time they go
to the Gap or Brooks Bros., they simply pick out the pants with a
36-inch waist and the shirt with the 16-inch neck. When they get
fat, they are faced with the cold, factual truth _ Got a 44-inch
waist, buddy? Well, you're fat! _ and simply scratch off the
numbers on the Levi's label.
</P>
<P>
   But every bubble has to burst. That same day on Martha's
Vineyard, a friend surprised me with a gift: a blue-and-white
polka-dot dress, a saucy Marilyn Monroe-esque number with a halter
top and a flared skirt, designed to play fast and loose with a
steam grate.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't have your size,'' he said, as I twirled in front
of the mirror, wearing my new, snug dress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh? What size is this?'' I asked, slowing the gleeful twirling
to a more dignified rotation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a, um, a 12,'' he said, staring down at his
hands, clasped humbly in his lap.
</P>
<P>
   I stopped the cake-display twirl. The room was suddenly very
quiet. It was a big moment. He looked up, and his terror-filled
eyes said: Is she going to hit me now?
</P>
<P>
   ``But the lady in the store said the sizes ran really small,''
he said, painfully nonchalant. ``I mean really, really small.''
</P>
<P>
   Good answer, I thought, and then took a pair of manicure
scissors and snipped out the label.

RIGHT NOW, BILL NEEDS HILLARY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, August 30, 1998)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's the end of the summer, the end of the bull market, and the
end of the honeymoon between Bill Clinton and the female voters who
up till now had mostly given him the benefit of the doubt.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not the end of his presidency, it is not the end of
his influence, and it need not be the end of his domestic
tranquility _ if Hillary Rodham Clinton hangs in there with him.
</P>
<P>
   The First Lady is a big part of the collateral damage caused by
the Monica missile. That not-so-smart-bomb came right down the
chimney of the Oval Office and, ignited by lust, bravado,
concupiscence or the kind of frat-house stupidity that is never
absent from the political gene pool, jolted America's faith in its
leader's concept of honor. What would Jackie O counsel Hillary?
</P>
<P>
   Bill bears the scarlet letter on his furrowed brow. Shame is the
rawest of emotions. Not only has one done something wrong, stupid
and base; but one is caught out, so the guilt is apparent to all,
and the blushing shines not only outward but inward, where it
constricts the gullet, sours the stomach, loosens the entrails,
taints the outlook on life. One shudders at the psychic cost.
</P>
<P>
   The public reaction was generally friendly and forgiving in
Worcester Thursday, it appeared. Ted Kennedy gave seatmate John
Kerry a lesson in how to stand by a fellow in a jam. Editorial
thunder scolds the voters for not being less forgiving. Anyone with
a keyboard puts the presidential marriage on the couch and
pontificates shamelessly. Hillary is upbraided for holding hands
with You-know-who. Every move is meticulously analyzed. A hundred
cameras on Martha's Vineyard are cocked for the slightest wrinkle
of petulance or frost.
</P>
<P>
   It's a rotten way to live, while trying to repair a
relationship, to raise a teenager. Being First Family can stagger
marriages; we've seen plenty evidence of that. Buddy the dog is the
only living thing in the White House whose opinion of Bill has not
changed. I am one who hopes Hillary forgives Bill, again, and tries
to move on.
</P>
<P>
   Not the least of Brother Bill's penance is the grief his
randiness showered on wife and daughter. Everyone's scarred by
proximity to this shoddy charade. Though it is not the end of the
world, its impact on his wife and daughter has to bother the hell
out of the president.
</P>
<P>
   Think ill of him as you may, his record is clear: he has never
been much of a villain, except in the eyes of political enemies
he's crossed. He does not have a track record as viictive,
punitive, mean-spirited, greedy. His indifference to money is
almost laughable in this age of I'll-get-mine-while-I-can. He is a
man of tolerance, inclusion, open-handeed-ness and
open-heartedness. Too open, too willing to feel your pain (and
perhaps more) if you're young and female and play up to his
blandishments.
</P>
<P>
   He may eventually stumble back into the good graces of enough
voters to survive, though the nation's editorial pages wax wroth,
and his many enemies in the media devote millions of harsh words
each day to denounce his fall from grace. That's politics. And
Bill, if he's shown nothing else, has shown he can handle the
politics with the best of them.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary has saved his sorry butt before. She burst on our
consciousness the night of the Super Bowl in '92, sitting on the
Ritz sofa in Boston, staring into the 60 Minutes camera, denying
she was lip-synching Loretta Lynn's lyrics of ``Stand By Your
Man.'' That steely stare-down of the nation's curiosity about her
marriage saved Bill's bacon that night. Hillary could have croaked
him with one arched eyebrow, and chose not to.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton now admits having lied about not having an affair with
Gennifer Flowers. I didn't buy his denial then. You never know for
sure about these kinds of things. But after listening to Gennifer's
tape of Bill's phone calls, hearing Clinton repeat rubbish about
Mario Cuomo, it just sounded to me like Bill and Gennifer were
involved. Put that together with the other rumors, the innuendo,
the ``bimbo eruptions'' that rattled the campaign War Room, and it
was plain Bill had an eye for the ladies. If it was OK by Hillary,
it was OK by me.
</P>
<P>
   So all of his appointees, staff, and associates who now claim to
be betrayed are, in my view, incredibly naive. Where were you when
all those smoke signals were darkening the sky? I concluded early
on that Hillary and Bill had some sort of deal. I don't know the
details, and don't want to know. He was Lil' Abner on the political
make in Arkansas, she was the icily-ambitious Wellesley girl
plunked down in Dogpatch. Early on he showed signs of world-class
political talent. She made her bargain. Both of them wanted to
change the world, late-'60's style. Neither could do it without the
other.
</P>
<P>
   The late Jim McDougal's new book, ``Arkansas Mischief, The Birth
of a National Scandal,'' written by the Globe's Curtis Wilkie, is
the best explanation I've seen of the political culture Bill &AMP; Hill
grew up in. McDougal explains the $2,000 retainer his Madison bank
paid the Rose firm as a regularization _ okay, laundering _ of a
$2,000-a-month payoff that was being fed Clinton. McDougal, an
admitted perjurer, is dead, as are some other participants, so we
may never know for sure, but the tale fits the times.
</P>
<P>
   My impression, just off seven years of Clinton-watching, is that
Hillary was the one most eager to make money, in Whitewater, the
cattle futures, her law career. Why? Bill was a naif when it came
to money, a political wunderkind who was only making 30 grand a
year as a backcountry governor. When Chelsea was born, Hillary may
have wondered: who's going to pay for her to go to Wellseley, or
Stanford? Certainly not Bubba here. I'll have to do it, she
reasoned.
</P>
<P>
   So she thrashed around in the Whitewater underbrush, lost money
in the deal, got cross with McDougal, fought over the partnership,
and eventually got snared when a vengeful prosecutor, Kenneth
Starr, got hundreds of FBI agents and $45 million of tax money to
destroy her husband, and her. Like Inspector Javert of Les Miz, the
puritanical Starr pursued relentlessly. This right-wing Ahab
devoted four years to harpooning Bubba the White Whale.
</P>
<P>
   Don't forget Starr piously doubting the Clintons' ``spousal
integrity'' early on. The public pillorying both Clintons endure
has to be weighed against everything they've done, for women,
blacks, the powerless. Hillary fell short on health care, alas. But
her fingerprints are all over those appointments naming women as
secretary of state, attorney general, Supreme Court justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every professional woman I know in Wasngton is furious at
him,'' said a female White House correspondent of the Monica
confession. His sin is incontestable. But all those women who got
big government jobs count for something, and that wouldn't have
happened without Hillary's decision, made years ago, to stand by
her man, the one with those soulful lyin' eyes.

<TEXT>
<P>
   It is no secret that employers have had to compete like never
before to hire and keep qualified workers in the 1990s. Now comes
research suggesting that pay increases could reach their highest
level in six years in 1999, fueled in large part by a rise in
bonuses, stock options and other variable forms of pay that are
being extended not just to senior executives but also to other
levels of the work force.
</P>
<P>
   Several private studies of employers' salary budget plans now
project combined merit, cost-of-living and incentive pay raises of
4 percent to 4.5 percent next year _ far more than double the
current annual inflation rate of 1.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next decade will really be the decade of the employee,''
said Wallace Nichols, executive director of the American
Compensation Association, a 23,000-member industry group in
Scottsdale, Ariz. ``Low inflation, low unemployment, continuing
scarcity of qualified workers and an increase in real wages are all
combining to put employees in the driver's seat.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, government data confirm that employers' costs to attract
and retain employees at all levels rose in the year ended June 30
at the greatest rate since 1993. The Employment Cost Index for all
civilian workers _ which measures changes in compensation costs,
including wages, salaries and employer costs for benefits _ rose
3.5 percent for the 12 months through June, according to the Bureau
of Labor Statistics.
</P>
<P>
   In the private sector, the index data show that wages and
salaries rose 4 percent for the year ended in June, compared with a
gain of 3.3 percent a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   A survey of 1,069 employers this summer by Hewitt Associates, a
management consultant based in Lincolnshire, Ill., found that
salary increases for those workers who don't qualify for overtime
will average 4.2 percent next year, the highest projected increase
since 1993, when raises averaged 4.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Increases are expected to average 4.1 percent for salaried
workers who are eligible for overtime; 3.9 percent for nonunion
hourly employees, 3.2 percent for union workers and 4.4 percent for
executives, the Hewitt survey suggests.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, a survey by the compensation association found that
1999 salary budget increases at almost 3,000 U.S. and Canadian
companies will average 4.35 percent. Moreover, the association's
survey indicates that the gains are consistent from region to
region.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Hewitt survey, employers are feeling the most
pressure to increase pay for information technology, engineering,
finance, sales and marketing positions.
</P>
<P>
   Salaries may be rising slowly and steadily, but there has been
far more rapid change in how companies are shaping their
compensation policies. Performance-based, or ``variable pay,''
rewards like bonuses and stock options are a growing part of the
total pay packages being offered to employees.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy-two percent of the employers surveyed by Hewitt reported
offering at least one variable-pay plan this year, up from 61
percent just two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The compensation association's survey found that the use of
stock is becoming prevalent in compensation plans. According to the
survey, conducted in June and July, 63 percent of companies offered
stock and stock-option plans to employees this year. And more
employees can expect offers of stock options next year, the
association said; nearly 55 percent of the companies reported that
they would extend stock options further down the organizational
ladder in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``Employees are getting heavily involved in all the variations
in pay, just like CEOs,'' Nichols said. ``It's no longer just a
package of perks for executives only.''
</P>
<P>
   John Boudreau, director of the Center for Advanced Human
Resource Studies at Cornell University, said the potential for
earnings windfalls tied to company performance was increasingly
driving today's work force and influencing the way companies
structured pay plans.
</P>
<P>
   Boudreau cited the ``dream factor'' _ the idea that a company
``may be the next Microsoft,'' turning its employees into instant
millionaires based on the swift growth in the value of their stock
options.
</P>
<P>
   ``It creates an interesting contract between employer and
employee'' that goes directly to the goal of retaining workers, he
said. ``The company is saying, `Join us, take on some of the risk
and perhaps you'll make out great.'''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that is not a sure thing. Employers are able to share
success with employees in profitable years, but retain the
flexibility to withhold bonuses or other incentives if the company
performs poorly.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, Boudreau questioned whether widespread use of
stock and bonuses would keep workers at a company in the long run.
Such variable-pay instruments ``work only if a company performs
well,'' he said. ``And if tomorrow everybody has them, will they
really be a competitive advantage or just a base benefit that
everyone gets?''
</P>
<P>
   A survey by Buck Consultants Inc., a human resources consulting
firm based in New York, found that 76 percent of 406 companies in
the Fortune 1000 use hiring bonuses to attract employees; 50
percent are using retention bonuses for their existing staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``The use of hiring and retention bonuses is a major shift in
compensation policy,'' said Paul Gavejian, a Buck compensation
consultant. Three-fourths of the survey respondents are also using
perks like performance bonuses, group incentives and stock options.
</P>
<P>
   And more employers are moving in that direction. Thirty-five
percent of companies responding to the compensation association's
survey reported that they planned to change compensation methods to
place more emphasis on variable pay over merit pay. But 86 percent
of companies that already have variable plans reported that those
plans were in addition to, not instead of, merit raises.
</P>
<P>
   Economists have warned that pay raises could end the low
inflation that has been a crucial component of the nation's robust
economy. But so far, the researchers noted, that hasn't occurred.
In recent years, they said, companies have largely succeeded in
keeping compensation costs in check, partly because of the
productivity gains realized from these types of incentives. Greater
reliance by companies on one-time variable forms of compensation
has made fixed salary budgets more flexible, they argue, and thus
controllable.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year, we've seen a number of trends converge,'' said Ken
Abosch, a compensation consultant at Hewitt who oversaw its survey.
``And the combined impact has been positive for employee
paychecks.''
</P>
<P>
   Nichols of the compensation association added, ``Reliance on
variable-pay plans won't trigger inflation because they are based
on company performance and won't be paid out if results are poor.
</P>
<P>
   ``What could affect inflationary pressures,'' he said, ``is the
continuing scarcity of labor and bidding up of costs to attract
qualified workers.''

HERE'S SOME DEEPLY MEANINGFUL STUFF ON RUSSIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL TAMMEUS  
 c. 1998 KANSAS CITY STAR 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With visions of impeachment dancing in his head, Bill Clinton is
off for a summit in Moscow with the mercurial Boris Yeltsin. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Moscow, as you may recall, is in Russia, which is no longer in
the Soviet Union because the whole Soviet Union itself went
belly-up several years ago. It happened when ideas about democracy
and market economies and cable TV swept through eastern Europe,
revealing communism to be the nincompoop idea everyone with a lick
of sense had always said it was. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Many Americans have to force themselves to remember that the
Soviet Union has gone the way of the dodo bird, which some of you
smarty-pantses (a description that certainly does not fit Bill
Clinton) may know by its technical name, Raphus cucullatus. I
didn't know it by that name until I looked up whether dodo is one
word or hyphenated, which shows you the depths of research to which
I'll go on your behalf. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   All of which tells me that some Americans may not fully grasp
the notion that Russia now is, once again, a country (sort of) all
its own and is no longer the Russian Soviet Federated Socialist
Republic, which was its ridiculous name until the Soviet Union
ceased to exist on Jan. 1, 1992. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (I don't know why, but for years now it has tickled me that my
father outlasted the Soviet Union by one day. He began his life
eight years to the day before the Bolshevik revolution succeeded in
1917, so he lived eight years and one day longer than the USSR _
and, I might be excused for saying, he did a lot more good for
humanity in his single life than the entire Soviet Union ever
did.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I am, it turns out, in a position now to enlighten you at least
a little bit about the struggling Russia that Bill Clinton is
visiting. One reason is that one of my sisters spent several weeks
there this summer cruising down rivers. And I have seen the
pictures she took. Seeing pictures is pretty much all it takes
nowadays to be thought of as an expert on something. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   My sister's Russian pictures show a beautiful countryside full
of handsome old buildings and sad people. (A little like Arkansas
now.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps one reason for the sadness (in Russia, not Arkansas) is
the people realize that their country is about twice the size of
the United States but has hardly any suburban shopping malls. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I have never been to Russia. But if, like my sister, I were to
spend several weeks floating down wide Russian rivers, I would take
every opportunity to yell from the deck something like this to
people on the banks: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``ATTENTION, you Russian people on the river banks who look so
sad: If you are sad because you wish you had some suburban shopping
malls, stop it. Cheer up. Malls are a bad idea. They chew up good
farmland and create hostile architecture and encourage wretchedly
excessive consumption of useless goods. Trust me. You're better off
nurturing your human-scale shopping districts in your towns and
villages, even if your ruble is now almost worthless.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, because I'd be yelling this, all the letters in all
these words would be capitalized. I chose not to do that here in
print because it's hard to read and off-putting and so forth and,
unless I miss my guess, you did not get this far to be off-put. You
got this far to see if you could learn something about Russia.
Well, it's not too late for that. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here's something you may not know about Russia: The 1997
population estimate was 147.3 million people. One of those Russians
is Boris Yeltsin. Yeltsin is like Mikhail Gorbachev was in 1990 in
that he already has accomplished all he can, yet he's (barely)
still in office. His predicament should give Yeltsin and Clinton
something in common to talk about. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Here are the leading figures in Russia's government,
parliament and business as the country struggles with the current
economic and political crisis:
</P>
<P>
   BORIS YELTSIN, 67, president
</P>
<P>
   Quote: ``I'm not going to resign. I will work as I'm supposed to
for my constitutional term. In 2000 there will be an election for a
new president and I will not run.''
</P>
<P>
   Background: Russia's first democratically elected president was
a political maverick in the old Communist Party. Yeltsin helped
hasten the end of the Soviet Union in 1991 and promised Russia the
rewards of democracy and free markets. Seven years later, the dream
has soured with economic and political chaos and an ailing Yeltsin
viewed as unable to cope with the crisis. While denying he will
resign, Yeltsin has agreed to cede powers to his prime minister and
parliament.
</P>
<P>
   VIKTOR CHERNOMYRDIN, 60, acting prime minister
</P>
<P>
   Quote: ``We must forget (political) ambitions, we must stabilize
the situation and ease tensions that have reached a critical
point.''
</P>
<P>
   Background: A Soviet-era bureaucrat, Chernomyrdin went on to
serve as Yeltsin's prime minister from December 1992 until March
this year, when he was fired for failing to fix the economy. Now
he's back and struggling to form a government and satisfy the
interests of the Communist opposition, Russia's powerful tycoons
and Western lenders urging Russia not to revive a Soviet-style
economy.
</P>
<P>
   GENNADY ZYUGANOV, 54, leader of the Communist Party
</P>
<P>
   Quote: ``We will only support a policy and a leadership that
will clearly and straightforwardly reject the so-called market
reforms and agree to take a different course.''
</P>
<P>
   Background: Leader of the opposition in the Duma, parliament's
lower house, Zyuganov was dismissed as politically impotent after
Yeltsin defeated him in the 1996 presidential race. But Zyuganov's
clout has risen considerably in the past week as he seeks a role
for his party in setting policy and filling key jobs in the new
government. Polls show he is the leading candidate to replace
Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   YEGOR STROYEV, 61, chairman of the Federation Council
</P>
<P>
   Quote: ``We should hurry to create a new government. Lack of any
authority at all is worse than the worst possible regime.''
</P>
<P>
   Background: The lackluster head of Russia's upper house of
parliament, Stroyev largely has served as a go-between for the
Kremlin and the Communist-dominated Duma. Opposition parties have
promoted him as an alternative candidate for prime minister. A
Soviet-era economist, he represents the interests of Russia's
provinces, whose governors sit on the federation council.
</P>
<P>
   YURI LUZHKOV, 62 mayor of Moscow and business tycoon
</P>
<P>
   Quote: ``If the Central Bank lacks either the money or the
desire to halt the crisis, the financial system will slowly crawl
towards destruction.''
</P>
<P>
   Background: The powerful mayor of Moscow -- who like
Chernomyrdin has aspirations to become president -- demonstrated
his status by his attendance in a meeting Friday with Yeltsin,
Chernomyrdin and Stroyev on the fate of Russia. A nationalist who
enjoys strong popularity in Moscow, Luzhkov has distanced himself
from the Kremlin during the current crisis. He could exploit the
current chaos to his political advantage should Chernomyrdin fail
to reverse the economic declines.
</P>
<P>
   ALEXANDER LEBED, 48, governor of the Krasnoyarsk region and a
presidential aspirant.
</P>
<P>
   Quote: ``Over the years, the population has grown poorer and
output has fallen, but the president and government told fairy
tales to Russians instead of taking the necessary steps.''
</P>
<P>
   Background: A tough-as-nails former army general with a popular
following in Russia (he finished third in the 1996 presidential
balloting), Lebed was courted by Chernomyrdin earlier this week in
what many analyst believed was an attempt to have him join the new
government. He likely wants to remain on the outside, though and,
like Luzhkov, attempt to exploit a failure of the new government in
time for the presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   BORIS BEREZOVSKY, 52, industrial and media baron; Yeltsin
advisor
</P>
<P>
   Quote: ``I am a product of privatization.''
</P>
<P>
   Background: A multibillionaire who helped finance Yeltsin's 1996
campaign and went on to become a Kremlin insider, Berezovsky has
emerged as the power behind the throne. Berezovsky is the most
prominent of the wealthy Russians known as the oligarchs, who made
their money buying and selling the assets of the dissolved Soviet
Union. He and others reportedly engineered Chernomyrdin's return to
protect the status quo, fearing economic reform amid the crisis
could dismantle their empires.
</P>
<P>
   ANATOLY CHUBAIS, 43, fired as Yeltsin's chief economic reformer
</P>
<P>
   Quote: ``Even given the present difficult financial situation,
there is no alternative to development of a market economy in
Russia or the country's integration into the world financial
system.''
</P>
<P>
   Background: Fired Friday as from his job as chief financial
liaison to the West, Chubais is an erudite reformer who since 1991
was the main architect of Russia's plan to privatize its Soviet-era
industries. He is the darling of Western economists, but is blamed
by many Russians for the country's economic misery and consistently
ranks as one of Russia's most unpopular figures. He continues as
head of Unified Energy Systems, the nation's electricity utility.

TRICKING PLANTS INTO BLOOMING EARLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Aug. 30)  
(lb) 
 By CASS PETERSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In gardening as in life, timing is everything. The fall asters
are setting buds and the Joe-Pye weed is in full and glorious
bloom, so naturally I'm thinking about next spring's sweet williams
and cornflowers.
</P>
<P>
   Many of spring's brightest flowers are biennials, plants that
live for two years, producing only foliage the first year and
blossoms the second. If planted in the late summer or early autumn,
however, they can be tricked into thinking they have had a whole
year in the ground already. Sweet william, a sweetly scented
relative of pinks and carnations, will be blooming next May if I
plant it in September.
</P>
<P>
   Other spring bloomers, like cornflowers and larkspur, are
technically annuals, but they are so hardy that even well into
Canada they will survive the winter as small seedlings. If planted
in the fall, they will burst into growth early the next season and
easily produce twice as many flowers as they would if planted in
the spring.
</P>
<P>
   Fall planting is also a useful subterfuge for Canterbury bells,
biennial varieties of foxglove, and many perennials that can't
tolerate muggy summers. If they are planted in autumn, they get
nothing but the cool weather they prefer from the time they are
committed to the soil until the time they open their flowers in the
spring.
</P>
<P>
   English daisy, for example, is a perennial so sensitive to heat
that it will grow in my south-central Pennsylvania garden only as a
fall-planted biennial. Spring-planted English daisies melt out by
the end of July, never living long enough to bloom the following
year.
</P>
<P>
   I grow lupines, which are perennials, in the cutting garden as
biennials, planting in the fall for cutting the next spring. There
are clumps of lupines in the perennial garden, but I can't reliably
supply the cool summers and mild winters they prefer. I never know
for sure whether the summer's heat will have weakened the lupine
enough that it will die over winter. As a hedge against a
lupineless spring, I plant a few in the autumn.
</P>
<P>
   To make room for all these flowers, I am happy to rip out the
flowering annuals that have brightened the garden all summer but
now are looking a little scraggly. Out with the mildewed zinnias,
the spent sunflowers and the petunias that I'm tired of pinching.
To every plant its season, and the time of the ageratum has come
and gone.
</P>
<P>
   Sweet william (Dianthus barbatus) and Canterbury bells, a
biennial member of the bellflower family that produces spikes of
cup-shaped flowers in shades of pink, blue and white, are best
planted from seedlings, which should be started about six weeks
before your first frost date.
</P>
<P>
   I prefer the tall cutting-type sweet williams, but the dwarf Wee
Willie is a charming edging plant, perfect for interplanting with
flowering spring bulbs. Single-flowered Canterbury bells (Campanula
Medium) do best in my garden, but the double-flowered
cup-and-saucer types (C. Medium calycanthema) are so striking that
I always plant a few.
</P>
<P>
   I like to crowd the plants a bit, planting them about 6 inches
apart, to encourage long stems. Canterbury bells have fairly weak
stems, and jamming them together allows the plants to support each
other.
</P>
<P>
   Biennial foxgloves and most perennials should also be started
indoors and put out as small plants. If you're a little late
getting the plants started, you can overwinter the seedlings in a
cold frame and set them out early next spring.
</P>
<P>
   Larkspur, cornflower and a few fast-germinating perennials like
feverfew can be seeded directly into the ground. They really should
be planted in the fall _ even though the instructions on seed
packets generally say cornflower and larkspur should be planted in
the spring, as early as the soil can be worked.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that in most years the soil is too wet to be
spaded up early enough in the spring to give the flowers the head
start they need. Or the soil can be worked but the gardener doesn't
much feel like getting out there in the icy March wind to do it.
The result is that the seeds don't get planted until late April or
May, which is not nearly soon enough.
</P>
<P>
   Larkspur must be exposed to a period of cold weather, or it
won't bloom properly. Each year I plant a bed of larkspur in
September and a second one the following spring, as early as I
possibly can. Larkspur is one of my favorite flowers for drying,
and I can never get enough. Each year the fall-planted larkspur
grows to 4 feet and blooms magnificently, while the spring-planted
larkspur manages only a modest display of blossoms on 2-foot
stalks.
</P>
<P>
   The same is true of cornflower (Centaurea Cyanus), and its
cousin sweet sultan (C. moschata). Both will bloom if planted in
the spring, but the plants will be much shorter than they would be
had they spent the winter in the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Spring-planted cornflowers usually come into bloom just about
the time the weather is heating up, and their delicate flowers
wither quickly. A bed of them planted in the fall will bloom in
late spring, following the spring bulbs.
</P>
<P>
   Of course they will also finish blooming fairly early in the
season. No problem. They can be pulled out then and replaced with
fresh zinnias and perfect petunias. Timing is everything.

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Tropical Storm Bonnie will sideswipe southeast New England early
Saturday, bringing gusty winds and fitful rains to parts of eastern
Massachusetts and Rhode Island. The system will then head toward
the Canadian Maritimes, allowing clouds to break and winds to ease
over southeast New England.
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane Danielle will continue to strengthen as it churns
west-northwest over the tropical Atlantic. Forecasting guidance
provided by computers suggests that Danielle will probably turn
northward and not threaten the Southeast seaboard, where
temperatures will climb into the middle and upper 90s under full
sunshine.
</P>
<P>
   A corridor of widely separated showers and thunderstorms will
develop from the northern and central Appalachians southwest across
the Tennessee and lower Mississippi Valleys to eastern Texas as a
trough of low pressure presses slowly east. Farther west, isolated
showers and thunderstorms will form over parts of Arizona in
response to moisture arriving from Mexico. Meanwhile, widely
separated showers and thunderstorms will develop in the very warm
and humid air mass covering Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Patchy fog and low clouds will caress the West Coast Saturday
morning before yielding to sunshine. Away from the coast, heat will
build across interior California and Oregon as a warm ridge of high
pressure holds steady several thousand feet above the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Variable clouds and breezy, cooler conditions will prevail over
the northern Great Lakes in the wake of a cool front pressing
southeast over the upper Middle West.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Discrepant Danielle
</P>
<P>
   The first reconnaissance from Hurricane Danielle on Thursday
puzzled weather specialists. A wind of 112 mph was measured at
about 10,000 feet, an altitude that is often used to gauge the
maximum speed near the surface. But the instrument package dropped
into the eye of the storm signaled back a central pressure of only
997 millibars, or 29.45 inches of mercury. Typically, such strong
winds at flight level would be associated with a pressure of 980
millibars. Apparently, due to a shifting wind below flight level,
the instruments dropped into the eye were carried outside the
center of the hurricane.

SEVERAL LATIN LEADERS RELUCTANT TO LEAVE OFFICE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: This is sider with Panama-President) 
(Sub for minor editing) 
 
By JOHN OTIS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PANAMA CITY, Panama _ President Ernesto Perez Balladares isn't
the only Latin American leader who has been reluctant to clean out
his desk.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Menem of Argentina, Fernando Henrique Cardoso of Brazil
and Alberto Fujimori of Peru have all engineered constitutional
amendments allowing them to run for immediate re-election. Thanks
to political maneuvering last week, Fujimori, who won a second term
in 1995, might seek a third term in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Critics warn that Latin American governments lack credible
checks and balances and that several years in power can turn
democrats into autocrats. But others say that voters have simply
rewarded accomplished chief executives for good work.
</P>
<P>
   ``This trend is related to good management,'' said a South
American diplomat. ``Efficient governments have earned the right to
continue.''
</P>
<P>
   For much of this century, Latin America was ruled by brutal
dictators and corrupt civilian ``caudillos'' who stayed in power
through military backing or electoral shenanigans.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican Revolution was launched in 1910, in part, because
President Porfirio Diaz arranged to have himself elected six times
over 34 years. ``No re-election'' was one of the revolution's
rallying cries.
</P>
<P>
   Despite regular elections in Nicaragua, the Somoza clan clung to
power for 43 years. Anastasio Somoza Debayle, the last of the
family rulers, was finally ousted in 1979 by Sandinista guerrillas
_ who promptly set up their own authoritarian regime led by
brothers Humberto and Daniel Ortega.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been some exceptions but, in general, re-election
is poison for democracy,'' said Bolivar Parientes, an opposition
Panamanian congressman.
</P>
<P>
   When dictators gave way to civilian leaders across much of the
region in the 1980s, most presidents were constitutionally required
to step down after one term.
</P>
<P>
   By then, Nicaraguans had become so wary of family dynasties that
they wouldn't even allow distant relatives of the president to seek
the office.
</P>
<P>
   Public opinion has only recently begun to shift with the
emergence of a handful of dynamic civilian leaders who have led
their nations out of crises.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s, Menem, Cardoso and Fujimori tamed hyperinflation,
stabilized the monetary system and brought galloping economic
growth to Argentina, Brazil and Peru. Fujimori dealt a crushing
blow to Peru's Sendero Luminoso rebel movement that had waged a
terrorist war against the state.
</P>
<P>
   All three leaders used their resulting political capital to push
through constitutional amendments allowing re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Warning that ``it's me or chaos,'' Menem went on to win a
landslide victory in 1995. Fujimori was returned to office with
more than three times the vote of his closest challenger. Cardoso,
who was first elected in 1994, is the front-runner going into
Brazil's first-round presidential vote in October.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you try to explain re-election in Argentina and Peru, you
have to take into account the extraordinary circumstances,'' said
Ricardo Arias Calderon, a former Panamanian vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Menem and Fujimori have demonstrated authoritarian
tendencies. Both maneuvered to extend their rule into the next
century.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori, in particular, has shown little patience for
democratic niceties. In 1992, he dealt with a corrupt legislature
and a growing rebel threat by dissolving Congress and declaring
one-man rule for eight months.
</P>
<P>
   Although Peru now has a semblance of constitutional rule, vast
powers remain in Fujimori's hands, and he seems reluctant to loosen
his grip. The courts are packed with the president's allies, and
the compliant Congress has approved laws with little debate.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Fujimori pushed through another constitutional
amendment that would allow him to seek a third consecutive
five-year term in 2000. Outraged opposition leaders called for a
citizen referendum on the issue, but the measure was blocked by the
pro-Fujimori Congress on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Menem considered further constitutional tinkering to pave the
way for a third term. But his popularity has fallen because of
rising unemployment. Last month, he announced that he would not run
in the 2000 election.
</P>
<P>
   Nations that don't allow re-election aren't necessarily more
democratic. Mexican presidents get just one six-year term. But
until very recently, Mexico was a virtual one-party state. The
Institutional Revolutionary Party has ruled the country since
1929. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; One diplomat pointed out that many Latin American nations
already have strong presidential systems. Rather than worrying
about the re-election of presidents, these countries should focus
on revamping their often corrupt and overworked legal systems and
strengthening their congresses.
</P>
<P>
   In Panama, for example, legislators lack staff and research
capabilities, making them dependent on the advice of the president
or their party's leaders. Lawmakers have little control over the
nation's budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``A good legal system would help tremendously. A real congress
would provide checks and balances,'' the diplomat said. ``But in
terms of improving things, re-election is not a priority.''

FASHIONABLY TRENDY, BUT EMPTY BY DESIGN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Aug. 30)  
(lb) 
 By FRANK DeCARO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Fur is not only back _ it's cool. So pronounces Vogue
in its big September issue.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine reports that hip-hop has gone glam as rappers trade
``baggy for Bulgari'' and opt for a look that's ``less ghetto, more
Gucci.'' The feature, called ``Rappers Deluxe,'' features Mary J.
Blige, Lil' Kim and Missy Elliott in three of the most happening
furs of the season. What would have been fashion suicide three
years ago is now fashion chic.
</P>
<P>
   It is quite a makeover _ lynx has never been more phat _ and one
that says a lot about where fashion is. As entertainment eclipses
the design world as the culture's most influential taste-maker,
glamour has become something you slap on like a fresh coat of
paint, and personal style something you change whenever the mood
strikes. Everyone's a chameleon. Take any girl, hire a stylist to
the stars, borrow some jewelry, and suddenly she's a Gabor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Renee Zellweger Goes for the Glamour,'' Vogue's cover
promises, as the homespun actress shows the world her Oscar. (It's
a de la Renta.) So what if you've never seen a Gretchen Moll movie?
She looks like a star on Vanity Fair, so she must be one.
</P>
<P>
   As a society, we've followed Madonna's advice of long ago _
``Strike a pose,'' she once commanded _ and embraced rampant
RuPaul-ism. We feel comfortable borrowing guises from other eras,
other classes and other cultures, without stopping to reflect on
their meaning. We've adopted a Village People approach to getting
dressed. One day you're an Alexander McQueen cowboy, the next
you're a John Galliano Indian.
</P>
<P>
   Playing dress-up is fun, of course. But when new fads are
embraced constantly, it means that the clothes don't have much to
say. An East Village girl in Sergio Valente jeans sports a bindi
jewel on her forehead. Does it mean she's found religion or that
she watches Gwen Stefani on MTV? Most likely, the latter.
</P>
<P>
   Fashion trends no longer speak of one's personal style but of
one's media savvy.
</P>
<P>
   Piercings, tattoos, henna painting: It all seems calculated,
coming from without rather than within.
</P>

   Not long ago, Pat Boone tried to make a comeback as a
heavy-metal rocker, trading his white bucks, a genuine fashion
statement of a mainstream pop idol, for black leather. It wasn't
provocative _ it was preposterous. If Debbie Boone's father is
wearing leather, it has no potency.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, at any Tom of Finland party, hundreds of men will turn
out in leather gear: advertising art directors, fashion editors,
stylists and not a real biker in sight. On nights like the one last
June at the Tunnel, so many were strapped in leather that it seemed
as if every gay man in New York had a harness in the closet hanging
between his Armani and his Zegna. What was once an underground
fetish has become just another look.
</P>
<P>
   Real leather men are too shocking for most of us today, as real
punks were 20 years ago. If it's genuine, it is too intense.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In college, I had my first truly punk experience. At a Bad
Brains concert at Roseland, a friend and I stood at the front of
the stage waiting for the hard-core band to come on. As a pre-show
crush began to form around us, I naively said to my companion,
``Oh, I hope they're not going to slam dance.'' A 4-foot-tall girl
with safety pins through her ear, a razor blade around her neck and
incredibly bad teeth looked up at me and scathingly asked what we
thought they might do instead. I fled immediately.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of weeks ago I had a punk experience, '90s style. On
the way to see ``The Avengers,'' I spotted three teen-agers who
looked like Sex Pistol wannabes in their Trash and Vaudeville drag
sitting on the curb on 19th Street, waiting for the theater to
start seating.
</P>
<P>
   The big one wore red tartan bondage pants, a leather jacket
covered in safety pins and a ripped T-shirt, his Mohawk gelled into
Statue of Liberty spikes. The other two were in thrift-store
tatters and Doc Martens, streaks of green Crazy Color dye in their
purposely damaged hair. They were just goofing around until a
pained cry pierced the night air. ``Ow! That actually hurt!'' the
nose-ringed one shrieked.
</P>
<P>
   Kid Vicious had accidentally poked him in the face with his
hair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Affectation can be dangerous,'' the British style pundit
Quentin Crisp once observed. He was referring to Isadora Duncan's
penchant for scarves, but he could just as easily have been
cautioning these kids.
</P>
<P>
   There's a little bit of poseur in all of us, to be sure, whether
we're jet-set society women wearing Kabuki couture, working stiffs
dressed in Ralph Lauren's off-the-rack version of Old Money, geeks
in hula shirts and jams who do all their surfing on the Net or
suburban hip-hoppers in droopy pants hanging at the mall.
</P>
<P>
   But real style isn't just a borrowed fur or another look on
loan. Even Marilyn Manson knows that. The rocker recently
jettisoned his trademark Goth image for a new glam one. ``If you're
gonna pretend to be something,'' he told Rolling Stone, ``then you
have to at least live up to what it is.''

STUDYING HOW THE DEFEAT OF HEAT CHANGED NEARLY EVERYTHING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Calif., Pa.)   (bl)  
 By JANNY SCOTT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   Raymond Arsenault stumbled into his scholarly sideline back in
1982 when he was invited to speak on a panel on climate and
history. ``Just tell them about air-conditioning,'' his wife, a
seventh-generation Floridian, suggested facetiously. And so began
Arsenault's great air-conditioning adventure.
</P>
<P>
   He turned his conference paper into an article, ``The End of the
Long Hot Summer: The Air-Conditioner and Southern Culture,'' which
was published in The Journal of Southern History, then syndicated,
then anthologized, then reprinted so often it has become the
journal's most requested article for the last 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm known jokingly among my friends as `the air-conditioner
man,''' said Arsenault, a professor of history at the University of
South Florida, who could be found recently discussing the cultural
history of air-conditioning on ABC's ``Nightline.'' ``I feel like a
typecast actor sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Air-conditioning, as it turns out, is a rich topic, something so
ubiquitous and so easily taken for granted that it seems to have
occurred to few scholars to examine its impact on everything from
industrialization, migration patterns and public health to
architecture, family life, the environment and attitudes toward
nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of my favorite subjects,'' said Richard Nathan, a
political economist and director of the Rockefeller Institute of
Government in Albany, N.Y. ``The civil rights revolution and
air-conditioning are the two biggest factors that have changed
demography and a lot of our politics in the last 30 years.''
</P>
<P>
   From the installation of the world's first air-conditioning
system in a Brooklyn printing company in 1902, through its march
through industrial plants, then movie theaters, then government
buildings, hospitals, hotels and finally homes, air-conditioning
was catapulted in the public perception ``from luxury to amenity to
necessity,'' as Arsenault recently put it.
</P>
<P>
   The population of the South grew dramatically, as mortality
dropped and in-migration grew. Air-conditioning proved crucial to
the industrialization of the region. It improved productivity and
encouraged economic growth, Arsenault concluded. It encouraged
urbanization, in part by helping make skyscrapers and high-rise
apartments more feasible.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Arsenault wrote, it ``weakened the bond
between humanity and the natural environment'' and ``impinged upon
a rich tradition of vernacular architecture'' by making it possible
to build inexpensive tract homes after World War II without the
high ceilings, long breezeways, open porches, transoms and other
features that once kept people cool.
</P>
<P>
   For years Arsenault's 32-page article, replete with footnotes
citing such sources as Air-Conditioning, Heating and Refrigeration
News, has stood as the most comprehensive scholarly attempt to
explore the history of air-conditioning, the growth of the industry
and air-conditioning's impact on society and culture.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Gail Cooper, a historian of technology and an associate
professor at Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pa., has published
``Air-Conditioning America: Engineers and the Controlled
Environment, 1900-1960'' (Johns Hopkins, 1998), a study focusing on
the engineering effort to create an ``indoor climate.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the National Building Museum in Washington, which
takes as its mission the celebration of American achievements in
``the built environment,'' intends to open next May what is being
billed as the first major exhibition to explore the transformative
power of air-conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cooper, 44, grew up with air-conditioning in California's
Central Valley and remembers crawling out of her crib and into the
hall to sleep on the floor under the air-conditioner. Now she lives
in an 1890s house in the historic district of Bethlehem, where her
summers are filled with ceiling fans, iced drinks and occasional
escape to the movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see it as a complex subject,'' Ms. Cooper said. ``I tried to
describe how users feel: sometimes they love it; sometimes they
don't.'' As for herself, she works in a windowless office. ``It's
the kind of room that is only possible with air-conditioning,'' she
said. ``I think a lot of people do miss windows.''

SOCIOLOGISTS WITH A GIG OFF THE BEAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ It was past the 10:30 starting time, but no one
seemed to pay much mind. The piano and horn players stood by the
baby grand laughing with a small circle of friends while the
audience chatted and sipped drinks in the too small, too hot room.
</P>
<P>
   Not much different from any Saturday at almost any jazz club.
Except the hour was a.m., the beverage of choice was coffee, the
venue was a conference room at the American Sociological
Association's annual convention and the neighbors who would soon be
complaining about the noise were from a panel on ``The Self and
Identity'' next door.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Harper, a sociologist at Duquesne University organized
last Saturday's panel, the first ever on the sociology of jazz. His
idea was to offer a smorsgasbord of current sociological work in
this increasingly popular field.
</P>
<P>
   The first panelist, Paul Applerouth of New York University, took
a historical approach, looking at how early anxieties about jazz
reflected worries over changing morals and crumbling racial
boundaries. (In 1926, the Salvation Army of Cincinnati filed a
lawsuit to prevent the construction of a jazz theater next to a
shelter for girls, arguing that ``music emanating from the theater
would implant `jazz emotions' in babies born at the home.'')
</P>
<P>
   David Grazian, a sociologist at the University of Chicago, then
discussed what's known in the trade as ``commodification,'' how
many of the supposedly ``authentic'' countercultural jazz musicians
and clubs now in Chicago are actually calculated Disneyland
versions, modern minstrel shows, replete with menus of watermelon
and barbecue ribs, and souvenir counters.
</P>
<P>
   And Paul Lopes, a sociologist at Tufts University, reviewed
previous work, noting how the image of the jazz musician has
embraced both the drug-using deviant and the professional, cultured
elitist.
</P>
<P>
   While these three looked at the jazz from the outside, Robert
Faulkner, who teaches at the University of Massachusetts at
Amherst, tried to get inside the process of creating the music. The
soul-tingling solo may sound like a spontaneous, inspired artistic
creation, but in fact the music is built on a series of routine
steps and conventions. Faulkner was trying to break down that
process of creation, to ``unpack culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Faulkner, who wears his black hair slicked back and bears a
passing resemblance to Regis Philbin (a comparison that would
undoubtedly mortify him), turned to sociology after striking out as
a studio musician in Los Angeles. To demonstrate the art of
improvisation, he began with his own experience as a trumpet
player, learning the introduction to the Dixieland classic ``Tin
Roof Blues'' by what sociologists call ``appropriating cultural
recipes,'' and what everybody else knows as stealing.
</P>
<P>
   Accompanying him on the piano was Howard (Count) Becker, one of
the pioneers of the sociology of jazz. Becker, who worked his way
through school playing piano on 63rd Street in Chicago, wrote a
classic book in which he used jazz to examine deviant behavior and
the love-hate relationship between the musicians and their
audience.
</P>
<P>
   With the Count at the baby grand and Faulkner on the cornet,
they started with the sinuous, rolling melody from Gershwin's
``Rhapsody in Blue,'' then picked up with a few bars from the
original introduction to ``Tin Roof Blues,'' before segueing into
an obscure R-and-B phrase and a classic Texas tenor lick.
</P>
<P>
   Jazz musicians, Faulkner explained, start with a common
vocabulary and grammar. This ``high scripting,'' as it's called, is
the conventional way of doing things, the standard set of tunes and
the way they're played. Think of the disaster film formula or even
the process of cooking a hamburger and fries at MacDonald's.
</P>
<P>
   High scripting requires enormous daily maintenance. As Donald L.
Maggin relates in his biography of Stan Getz, Getz pored over
Lester Young's solo rendition of John Green's 1930 classic ``Body
and Soul,'' listening to it hundreds of times. (Faulkner said he
had worked on the piece 15 minutes every day for the past 15
years.) Improvisational magic comes when the musician takes the
result of his solitary, tedious practicing and exports it back to
the stage in his or her own voice.
</P>
<P>
   You can hear the process, Faulkner says, by comparing the
different recording sessions leading to the final version of John
Coltrane's 1959 breakthrough album ``Giant Steps.'' ``As you
listen, you can hear Coltrane taking on and discarding different
ideas,'' Faulkner said. This move from high to low scripting is not
just confined to jazz, but can be found in painting, writing and
haute cuisine as well.
</P>
<P>
   Faulkner's sociological rendition of ``Body and Soul'' began
with exercise No. 141 from the horn player's bible, ``Clarke's
Technical Studies for Cornet,'' included a phrase from ``Star
Eyes,'' Janet Jackson's ``Where Are You Now,'' (which he was
introduced to by his 8-year-old daughter) and then a snatch from
``Alfie.''
</P>
<P>
   It was an improvisational in-joke. When Dexter Gordon recorded
``Body and Soul'' on his ``Manhattan Symphony'' album, he inverted
a series of notes from ``Alfie,'' which Sonny Rollins had recorded
for the 1966 movie.
</P>
<P>
   Round noon, Harper stepped in to cut off Faulkner, who was
running over his allotted time. He noted that as John Coltrane got
older, his solos were running longer and longer, 25, 30, 35
minutes. Troubled, Coltrane talked to Miles Davis about it. How do
I finish my solos, he asked. ``John,'' Davis replied, ``Put the
horn down.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time Faulkner put the horn down, the standing-room-only
crowd was spilling out into the hallway of the Hilton hotel, and a
dollar had been stuffed in a glass atop the baby grand.

PANAMANIAN VOTERS TO DECIDE RE-ELECTION FATE OF PRESIDENT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (For release Sunday, Aug. 30) 
(Eds.: Vote is Sunday) 
 
By JOHN OTIS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PANAMA CITY, Panama _ After being ruled by a tyrant nicknamed
``Pineapple Face'' and a jocular president known as ``Sweetbread,''
Panamanians have a dynamic chief executive whom everyone calls
``The Bull.''
</P>
<P>
   Under President Ernesto Perez Balladares, Panama's economy has
expanded, and poverty has fallen. Highways, hospitals and public
housing have gone up.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the president's bid to keep his job past September 1999 _
three months before the United States is to hand over the Panama
Canal _ is in jeopardy. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Panamanians vote Sunday on a constitutional amendment that, if
passed, will allow the president to run in May for a second
consecutive five-year term.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say the outcome of the binding referendum is too close
to call. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Perez Balladares claims that Panama requires a steady hand as
U.S. troops leave the country and the nation prepares to assume
full control of the Panama Canal on Dec. 31, 1999. He says
continuity is needed, as Panama wrangles with Washington over a
proposed multilateral anti-drug center in the former canal zone
that would be staffed with about 2,000 U.S. troops. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Negotiations for the center have stalled, in part, due to
Panama's concerns that it could turn into a full-fledged military
base and be used as a staging ground for U.S. military activities
in the region. Under the 1977 Panama Canal treaties, all 10,000
U.S. troops who had been stationed at 10 bases here must leave by
the end of next year.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the constitutional amendment say Panama needs
Perez Balladares in the presidential office during this period of
transition.
</P>
<P>
   But critics insist that the country's democracy is too fragile
to permit the president's immediate re-election. Under current
Panamanian law, an outgoing president cannot run again until 10
years after leaving office.
</P>
<P>
   Calling Perez Balladares an unscrupulous liar and a
dictator-in-waiting, opponents of the amendment point out that the
president indicated in a 1995 interview that he would not seek
re-election.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president is very powerful. He is practically a king,''
said Ricardo Arias Calderon, a former vice president who is urging
Panamanians to vote ``no'' in the referendum. ``If he gets any more
power, the king may decide not to step down.''
</P>
<P>
   Such concerns spring partly from Perez Balladares' past. He
heads the Democratic Revolutionary Party, or PRD, which long served
as a rubber stamp for the whims of dictator Manuel Noriega. In
1989, invading U.S. troops arrested Noreiga on drug charges, ending
two decades of military rule. The former dictator, whom many call
``Pineapple Face'' because of his pock-marked skin, is serving a
40-year-sentence in a U.S. federal prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the point of view of democratic development, I don't
think it's a good thing to give someone 10 years in power after 21
years of dictatorship by the same group of people,'' said Raul
Leis, a political scientist at the Center for Panamanian Studies
and Social Action.
</P>
<P>
   In Panama, executive-branch powers already are vast. The
president controls the national budget and can manhandle the
legislature. He names supreme court justices, the attorney general,
the comptroller general and election tribunal members.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Leis said, Perez Balladares is perhaps the most
talented president in Central America. He is far more popular than
Guillermo Endara, his predecessor, who was known as ``Sweetbread``
due to his sunny disposition but was widely viewed as ineffective.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the last government had done half of what we've done, the
country would be much better off. But they didn't,'' said Housing
Minister Francisco Sanchez Cardenas, coordinator of the ``yes''
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Others say that fears of a civilian dictatorship are overblown.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential re-election ``doesn't raise any red flags,'' said
Peggy Scranton, a political scientist at the University of Arkansas
who has written a book on Panama. ``I think the country has had
plenty of time (to consolidate democracy). People have become
hypersensitive to the misuse of power.''
</P>
<P>
   Called ``The Bull'' for his ample girth and headstrong
personality, Perez Balladares was elected in 1994. He quickly
pushed through a series of free-market reforms that cut import
tariffs, revised the labor code, streamlined the government and
forced Panama to plug into the global economy.
</P>
<P>
   In a nationally televised address Thursday, Perez Balladares
argued that he needs more time to complete his reforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are starting to see results,'' he said. ``What I'm
interested in is finishing my program of government ... to make
sure that the things we have done bare fruit.''
</P>
<P>
   Perez Balladares said the fate of the proposed anti-drug center
is uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if (an agreement) will be signed or not,'' he
said. ``If the conditions that Panama believes are necessary are
accepted by the United States and other countries, it will happen.
If not, it won't.''
</P>
<P>
   Panama suggested building the anti-drug center, because it has
been unable to attract substantial new development to the 335,000
acres of the former canal zone.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. military withdrawal from Panama is nearly complete.
Polls indicate, however, that most Panamanians support a continued
U.S. military presence here.
</P>
<P>
   Should Panama's 1.7 million eligible voters approve Sunday's
amendment, Leis said that Perez Balladares would almost surely win
the May presidential election. However, a ``no'' vote could kill
the anti-drug center negotiations and stall other major
initiatives, according to a Western diplomat.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would be a lame duck that has been explicitly rejected,''
the diplomat said of Perez Balladares. ``He will suffer a major
loss of political power.''
</P>
<P>
   To avoid that scenario, the ``yes'' campaign has spent about $5
million, Leis said. It has saturated TV stations with propaganda,
staged free street festivals with salsa bands and hired James
Carville, a longtime strategist for U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, Perez Balladares had expected an easy victory.
After all, Argentina, Brazil and Peru have all passed amendments to
allow consecutive presidential re-election.
</P>
<P>
   But rather than focusing on constitutional issues, the campaign
here has turned into a plebiscite on Perez Balladares.
</P>
<P>
   And he is gradually losing support.
</P>
<P>
   His economic reforms, which analysts say were unavoidable, have
angered industrialists, organized labor and the lower class. These
groups had expected protectionist policies and more social spending
from Perez Balladares, whose 1994 campaign slogan was ``power to
the people.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, they accuse the president of empowering bankers and
stockbrokers. Alfredo Oranges, a dissident PRD legislator, accused
Perez Balladares of ``hating the poor.''
</P>
<P>
   Another problem is the lack of a compelling national theme to
rally Panamanians around the banner of presidential re-election.
</P>
<P>
   The three South American nations that have already changed their
constitutions to allow the practice did so to award presidents for
guiding them through periods of severe economic and political
upheaval.
</P>
<P>
   Panama suffered a traumatic U.S. invasion. But by the time Perez
Balladares was sworn in, the nation was back on its feet.
</P>
<P>
   Even the hand-over of the canal is considered a nearly done
deal. Most of the U.S. managers and laborers already have gone
home. Today, 93 percent of the 8,000 canal workers are Panamanian.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think a change of president in 1999 represents the
difference between chaos and order,'' said Fernando Manfredo, a
former administrator of the Panama Canal Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the ``no'' forces, made up of seven opposition parties,
could lose today if they fail to get out the vote. Divided and
disorganized, the parties signed a unification accord just last
week and failed to open a campaign office. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Back in 1994, similar divisions among these parties _ and their
failure to back a single candidate _ allowed Perez Balladares to
win the presidency with just 33 percent of the vote.

LOW-COST, COOL iMAC A HIT WITH FEW FLAWS 
 
(Eds.: Resending) 
 
By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Let's get two obvious things out of the way first.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Apple Computer's iMac is the coolest-looking computer
around. Apple has done a wonderful job of designing something
that's both very functional and aesthetically pleasing. It's also
given the company a great marketing opportunity, which has given
birth to a wonderful slogan: ``Sorry, no beige.''
</P>
<P>
   And no, the iMac does not have a floppy disk drive, and yes,
that's a big mistake. The floppy is not dead yet, and Apple's done
a disservice to buyers of the iMac by forcing them to spend extra
cash for an external, removable drive.
</P>
<P>
   The iMac is to Apple what the K-car was to Chrysler. It's the
product Apple is counting on to pull it permanently out of trouble.
It seems to be working _ iMacs are moving off the shelves at a
feverish pace. Apple's future hasn't looked this bright in years.
</P>
<P>
   It is also Apple's play for the low-cost, consumer market. At
$1,299, it's not as cheap as some Windows-based PCs, but it has the
benefit of being better designed and easier for novices to use.
</P>
<P>
   While Apple offers ``no beige'' for the iMac, it doesn't offer
any other colors, either. Its translucent, teal-and-white case is
all that's available. It looks nice in most decors, so long as the
carpet isn't fire-engine red and the walls aren't painted plum.
</P>
<P>
   The iMac is incredibly easy to set up, partly because the
monitor is built into the case. Plug the power cord (it's
translucent, too) in the back. Open a small door on the right side
to connect the keyboard, phone cord and any network cables if you
have them. Plug the mouse into a port on the side of the keyboard.
Push the power button on the keyboard, and that's it _ the iMac is
ready to rock.
</P>
<P>
   On initial power-up, the iMac walks you through a series of
set-up questions, determining if you are on a network and whether
you want to set up Internet access. While the Net access assistant
isn't quite as friendly as the Internet wizard found on Windows
95/98, it greatly simplifies this process for Macintosh owners.
</P>
<P>
   The operating system is basic Mac OS 8.1. Don't expect any
software surprises; what's new here is the hardware design. But the
Mac OS is better integrated with the Mac hardware than Windows is
with the Intel architecture _ you can't beat the Mac for
plug-and-play _ and the Mac's user interface is simpler. Given that
the market for this machine includes novices and home users, basic
may be better.
</P>
<P>
   With its 233-megahertz PowerPC G3 chip and 32 megabytes of
memory, it's a relatively fast computer, performing basic tasks,
such as launching programs and switching between them at speeds
comparable to Windows machines with similar specifications. If you
work with graphics-intensive programs, it will outrun most
Windows-based machines, but don't expect miracles for day-to-day
applications.
</P>
<P>
   The iMac uses two kinds of connections for hardware. There's a
built-in Ethernet port for connecting the system to a network, and
Universal Serial Bus, or USB, ports. There are no serial nor SCSI
ports, which means any devices you connect to this will have to use
USB connections, or go through an adapter. Because USB is
relatively new, there are not yet a lot of USB-based products,
though many are promised from manufacturers. Adapters are available
in the $50-$60 range.
</P>
<P>
   The iMac comes with a 56K modem _ I couldn't get it to do better
than 33.6, which apparently is a common complaint among many new
iMac owners _ and a 24-speed CD-ROM drive. Two small,
mediocre-sounding speakers are built into the front of the case.
The built-in, 15-inch monitor is an excellent display.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding the iMac's floppy-free concept: it's definitely an
idea way ahead of its time. Apple argues the floppy is dead, and
raises this question: ``When was the last time you used your floppy
disk drive?'' They say that most software today comes on CD-ROM,
and that most data files are bigger than the floppy's 1.44-megabyte
capacity.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe hyper-geeks who are comfortable burning their own CD-ROM
disks think the floppy is dead, but most home users still rely on
the format. What about children working on Macs at school who want
to bring their efforts home on floppy disk?
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, there's no removable-disk standard that's
taken the floppy's place. Consumers can choose from a variety of
formats _ 100-megabyte Iomega Zip drives, LS120 SuperDrives,
Syquest's 1- and 1.5-gigabyte SparQ drives and Sony's upcoming
high-density floppies. The Zip drive has a bigger installed base,
but it's by no means a standard.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to buy an external drive, you'll have to pay about
$90 for a USB-based floppy, which is ridiculous for a consumer
machine. If you decide to move up to a larger format, such as the
LS120, you'll pay $120 and more.
</P>
<P>
   If its designers were going to insist on leaving out the floppy,
Apple should have made an external floppy an option in the $30
price range.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the lack of a floppy drive, my only serious complaint
about the iMac has to do with its mouse. The design is, frankly, an
abomination. The mouse is flat and round, like a pancake. It's
uncomfortable to use in a long computing session. And because it's
perfectly round, you've got no tactile sense of where the ``top''
of the mouse is pointing. After a while, I find that I've lost the
mouse's orientation and must adjust it. Fortunately, because it's a
USB-based mouse, it's easy to replace. Companies like Logitech that
make mice are going to make a killing.
</P>
<P>
   (At first, I thought this was just me, so I asked some of the
artists at work who are longtime Mac users to give it a try. They
hated it, too.)
</P>
<P>
   If you are the owner of an aging Mac at home, such as one of the
older Performa models, and you've been waiting for Apple to create
a compelling new consumer offering, you need wait no longer. The
iMac is a must for you.
</P>
<P>
   If you are one of the millions of people who have yet to take
part in the personal computer revolution and have not yet learned
how to use a computer, the iMac is an excellent choice.
</P>
<P>
   If you're a novice Windows user who hates hassling with the
quirks and shortcomings of that operating system _ and if you don't
have a large investment in applications software _ the iMac is
worth considering.
</P>
<P>
   While I'm a Windows kinda guy, it feels very good to be able to
once again recommend a Macintosh to certain readers. Thanks, Apple.

Russian economy at present exchange rates. Japan is so monumental
as to be central to the health of the global economy, but for now
it remains a mess, albeit an impressively large one. A month after

LINDSEY TESTIFIES TO GRAND JURY IN CLINTON INVESTIGATION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Deputy White House Counsel Bruce Lindsey finally
testifed Friday before a federal grand jury, ending a hard-fought
battle to keep him from being questioned about President Clinton's
acknowledged relationship with former White House intern Monica
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsey testified for nearly four hours.
</P>
<P>
   As he left the federal court house, the president's closest
confidant declined to talk about his appearance or whether he
refused to answer some questions as he has done on three previous
occasions. Asked if he expects to be called back, Lindsey said, ``I
don't know. It's up to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Lindsey, who had tried to claim lawyer-client privilege about
his conversations with the president, was forced to appear before
the grand jury after the Supreme Court denied a White House request
to block his testimony on grounds that it would violate the
president's right to confidential legal advice.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court has yet to rule, however, on the larger White
House motion claiming attorney-client privilege concerning the
president's conversations with Lindsey. That ruling will not come
until after October, which may be after Starr wraps up his
investigation. The probe began with Clinton's Whitewater land deal
connections and is ending with an unprecedented examination of
whether the president lied about having a sexual relationship with
Lewinsky in the White House and tried to cover it up.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsey is considered a key witness in Starr's investigation.
But it is still unclear whether he has given Starr any information
that could be used to build a case of perjury or obstruction of
justice against the president.
</P>
<P>
   Starr is reportedly interested in learning whether Lindsey was
involved in an alleged cover-up of the president's liaisons with
Lewinsky or tried to influence the testimony of other witnesses
before the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Starr also is said to be interested in Lindsey's conversations
last year with Linda Tripp, whose secret and perhaps illegal tape
recordings of Lewinsky triggered the prosecutor's look into
Clinton's sex life. Lindsey apparently spoke to Tripp in an attempt
to learn more about allegations that the president made unwanted
advances on former White House volunteer Kathleen Willey in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   As Lindsey appeared before the grand jury, reports surfaced that
Lewinsky and Clinton secretary Betty Currie may have provided
different stories to Starr about how gifts the president gave to
the former intern were retrieved from her apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Currie, according to sources who spoke with The Associated
Press, testified that she picked up the gifts after being asked to
by Lewinsky. Her testimony is similar to what President Clinton has
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Lewinsky, the sources said, testified that Currie showed up
on her own and asked for the gifts to be returned to the president.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors working with Starr believe that the retrieval or
return of the gifts indicates that Clinton and Lewinsky may have
been trying to erase evidence of their relationship at a time when
the president was being sued by Paula Jones for sexual harassment.
Lewinsky was eventually questioned by Jones' attorneys and denied
having a sexual relationship with the president.
</P>
<P>
   In another development Friday, the Baltimore Sun reported that
Tripp, who is under investigation for illegal wiretapping in
Maryland because she taped conversations with Lewinsky, was told
when she bought her telephone taping equipment that it was illegal
to secretly record in the state.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Radio Shack store where she bought the
taping equipment issued a statement saying that it was the
company's policy to tell buyers that secretly taping phone
conversations would be a violation of Maryland law.
</P>
<P>
   Tripp, who sent her tapes of Lewinsky to Starr back in January,
has maintained that she was not aware that secretly recording over
the phone is illegal in Maryland. &QL;

REFORMED QUEST FACES DISTANCE CHALLENGE AT TRAVERS

<TEXT>
<P>
   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. _ Shug McGaughey, who was born in
Lexington, Ky., site of the bluest of the bluegrass, is a
consummate horseman and has trained a long list of outstanding
horses, including seven Eclipse Award winners.
</P>
<P>
   McGaughey, 47, saddled his first winner at Rockingham Park in
1976 and has seen a lot over the years. Never, though, had he faced
as big a challenge as he did with Cornado's Quest, the reformed bad
boy, who won the $1 million Haskell at Monmouth Aug. 9 and is
listed at 8-5 to capture the 129th running of the $750,000 Travers
Stakes at Saratoga today.
</P>
<P>
   A son of Forty Niner who won both the Haskell and the Travers in
1988, Coronado's Quest won three straight stakes at Aqueduct last
fall to establish himself as a horse to watch for the Kentucky
Derby. When he arrived at Gulfstream Park for his winter campaign,
things were supposed to get better, but they got worse, much worse.
</P>
<P>
   Favored at 4-5 in the Hutcheson Stakes Jan. 31, Cornado's Quest
pulled a nutty in both the paddock and the post parade and finished
second. He wasn't any better before the Fountain of Youth Feb. 21,
acting up and finishing second at 7-5. The Florida Derby on March
14 was the final straw as he behaved badly again and faded to fifth
at 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   But this time McGaughey did something about it. He had known for
some time that Coronado's Quest was having minor breathing
problems, but after jockey Robbie Davis told him the horse had
``made a big noise'' in the Florida Derby, McGaughey had him
operated on to correct an entrapped epiglottis. Coronado's Quest
has not lost since, piling up four victories since April 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very disappointed this winter in Florida,'' said
McGaughey. ``He just became completely unglued in the paddock
before the Hutcheson. We never got him back after that. I think
because of that one day, the whole winter was lost. As soon as we
got him out of Florida, he's not been beaten. He hasn't done
anything wrong since. He got through the Haskell in good shape.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know there'll be a lot of people here for the Travers, but
there won't be 80,000 as there were for the Belmont (Coronado's
Quest won the Riva Ridge on the undercard). There were 40,000 at
the Haskell and he was fine. I go into every race hopefully
optimistic. I hope it's all behind him.''
</P>
<P>
   Assuming he behaves himself, the big question Coronado's Quest
must answer is whether he can handle the mile and one-quarter
Travers distance. His main opponent, the 7-5 favorite Victory
Gallop, long ago proved he could run a long way, finishing second
in the 10-furlong Kentucky Derby and the Preakness, at a mile and
three-16ths, and winning the 1 1/2-mile Belmont. Victory Gallop, a
son of noted closer Cryptoclearance, has a big heart, but he
doesn't have quick feet. Coronado's Quest, who has a sharp turn of
foot, got the jump in the Haskell and Victory Gallop couldn't catch
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the distance is going to be a problem for him,
though I might say something different after the race,'' McGaughey
continued. ``I'm not worried about a mile and one-quarter. He's the
kind of horse who will wait on his rider and I've always been told
that a horse who waits on his rider will run as far as he has to.''
</P>
<P>
   Another factor to look at is that, while he has been training
very well here, Victory Gallop has never raced at The Spa, while
Coronado's Quest won two of three starts here as a 2-year-old,
losing only to eventual Horse of the Year Favorite Trick (who will
run in the 7-furlong King's Bishop on the Travers undercard) in the
Hopeful.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he likes this racetrack,''said McGaughey. ``He prefers
a bigger track (Saratoga is a 1 1/8-mile oval). He struggles to
change leads sometimes and I think he'll like the bigger turns
here.''
</P>
<P>
   McGaughey, who trained back-to-back Travers winners, Easy Goer
in 1989 and Rhythm in '90, schooled Coronado's Quest in the
Saratoga paddock Fridaythe last two days. Friday, Coronado's Quest
was well behaved, but on Thursday he created a bit of a stir with
some high-flying antics.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was certainly not the performance that we wanted, but it
was just feeling good kind of stuff,'' explained McGaughey. ``He
was bucking and kicking. It wasn't the stop and turn the other way
stuff he did in Florida. I think it's likely that the entrapped
epiglottis was the problem. He was not comfortable at Gulfstream.
We have used patience. My people have done a great job and they've
taken their time. We're just going to keep doing what we've been
doing since April.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is, we're at Saratoga. We've seen upsets here
time and time again. Strange things happen. So, let's go over
there, run the race, and, hopefully, whoever is the best horse will
win.''

IN GIULIANI'S CRACKDOWN ON PORN SHOPS, COURT RULING IS A SET BACK 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By DAVID ROHDE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A state judge dealt a blow Friday to New York City's
efforts to curtail the pornography industry, ruling that Show
World, a midtown Manhattan porn emporium, and two other adult video
stores can stay in business as long as no more than 40 percent of
their floor space and inventory are dedicated to adult
entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling by Judge Stephen Crane of state Supreme Court in
Manhattan breaks a long-running series of legal victories on the
issue for the Giuliani administration and suggests that the mayor
may achieve only a muted victory in his crackdown on sex shops. The
city said it would not appeal Crane's ruling, but it vowed to
continue trying to shut sex shops.
</P>
<P>
   While several strip clubs have already been shut down under the
new anti-pornography zoning law, Friday's court ruling indicates
that some adult video stores may be able to remain open by selling
non-adult merchandise in the front portion of their sales space and
reserving back rooms for adult entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   In trying to comply with the new zoning restrictions, the owners
of Show World, a 20-year-old, three-story business on Eighth Avenue
near Times Square, took advantage of vague language in the new law
that defined an adult establishment as a business that devotes a
``substantial portion'' of its stock or floor space to adult
entertainment. Citing the city Department of Building's
interpretation of ``substantial portion'' as more than 40 percent,
Show World and other video stores replaced more than 60 percent of
their ``triple X'' videos, ``peep-a-live'' booths and other sex
merchandise with luggage, cameras, NYPD T-shirts and classic films.
They then declared themselves ``non-adult'' businesses to the
court.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the city argued that the changes were a
``subterfuge'' by the stores to evade the new law, which bars adult
video stores and strip clubs from operating in residential areas or
within 500 feet of a school, house of worship or another sex shop.
</P>
<P>
   But in his opinion, Crane ruled that the changes implemented by
Show World, NRS Video and Les Hommes were substantial and make them
``non-adult businesses'' under the new law.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the victory by the sex shops, questions remain whether
sex shops that eliminate more than 60 percent of their lucrative
pornographic merchandise can remain economically viable,
particularly in high-rent parts of Manhattan such as Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   Crane suggested in his ruling that the tactics used by the city
in enforcing the new law, tactics sex-shop owners have complained
are heavy handed, may have backfired.

THERE'S NO SPORT LIKE BASEBALL   AND ITS RECORDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's late August 1998, and what kind of a sports world is it?
</P>
<P>
   It's one in which an individual obsession _ ours, not the
athletes' _ is the leading topic in sport. Totally secondary to the
issue of winning and losing baseball games is the matter of whether
or not Mark McGwire, Sammy Sosa, or Ken Griffey hits another home
run and thus comes closer to catching the late Roger Maris. It is,
I suspect, much more of an American character trait to care about
personal records of any kind than it is elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   This interest speaks to the nature of the game, of course. It is
yet another example of how baseball will always dwarf our other
major team sports as a conversational topic. No other sport can be
so readily dissected into manageable conversational parts. Batting
is one fascinating topic. Pitching and defense have their own
endless areas of discussion. Each position _ the infield admittedly
more so than the outfield _ is specifically fascinating in a way
that, say, basketball or hockey positions can never be.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, we Americans love to quantify. The most. The biggest.
The longest. There is something within us that just loves lists and
rankings. The 100 greatest movies. The 100 greatest novels. The top
10 steakhouses. The top five sunsets.
</P>
<P>
   That's the subjective stuff. We get to that when we're through
with the clinically objective, and that's something sport provides.
We adore records. The team record, the arena record, the league
record, the all-time record, the record for holding the most
records (Wayne Gretzky, I suppose) ... we can't get enough of
records. And of all the American sports records, the one we
venerate the most is that for home runs in one season.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other achievements (scoring points in basketball comes to
mind), it is a pure, unarguable feat. Once a basketball player
reaches a certain talent level, he or she can score points if
enough shots are taken. But hitting a home run is an isolated act.
It is _ and this can never be emphasized enough _ not easy. It is
not a matter of sheer strength. It is not strictly a matter of
timing. It is not simply a matter of game intelligence. It is a
matter of all three.
</P>
<P>
   You know, everyone now routinely speaks of it being Maris's
record, which, of course, it is, but I believe the ultimate reason
it matters as much as it does is that in our collective
subconscious mind it still belongs to Babe Ruth and not the
taciturn Yankee of far more modest career accomplishment who
unaccountably exceeded his previous career best by 32 home runs to
break Babe's record back in 1961.
</P>
<P>
   Hear me out. Please.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth remains the most outsized figure in the history of
baseball, if not in all of American sport. He was a pure fictional
character, a socially maladjusted, thumb-his-nose-at-society
roughneck from Baltimore who was on his way to a Hall of Fame
career as a lefthanded pitcher when Red Sox general manager Ed
Barrow converted him to a full-time outfielder in 1919 in the
belief that this man-child was too talented a hitter not to be in
the lineup every day. On a 1-to-10 scale of sports prescience, Mr.
Barrow's decision rates as somewhere between a 15 and a 16. It was
the single wisest American sports judgment of this century.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth popularized the home run. Indeed, he was the home run in
the eyes of the American sporting public. The fact remains that,
dead ball or no, if Ruth had been a full-time outfielder from the
beginning of his major league career late in 1914, he would have
had little trouble making up the 41-homer gap between his career
total of 714 and Hank Aaron's record total of 755. Hank has the
record in people's heads; the Babe has the record in their hearts.
</P>
<P>
   So, too, with Roger Maris and his 61. He did it. We all know
that. He did it with eight more games at his disposal, but he did
it in far tougher overall circumstances, in an era of
coast-to-coast travel and specialized relief pitching and sliders
and overall daily media attention that the Babe never had to
contend with. But the fact that it was Roger Maris, and not Mickey
Mantle, Willie Mays, or Hank Aaron, who did it always has been an
open sore in the American sports consciousness. He did it, yes. But
did he deserve to do it? In their hearts, millions of baseball
enthusiasts say no. That's just the way it is.
</P>
<P>
   The record resonates, I firmly believe, not because Maris holds
it but because Ruth, the very symbol of the home run itself, was
the man who first put the magic number of 60 on the board.
</P>
<P>
   That is why it is so easy to root for McGwire, as opposed to
either Sosa or Griffey. McGwire, so classically Brobdingnagian, is,
at the very least, the Jimmie Foxx, if not the Babe Ruth himself,
of our time. Of all the players who have come into the game in the
63 years since the Babe's retirement, McGwire is clearly the most
deserving heir to the swat throne. He looks the part, he acts the
part, and, with 50-plus home runs in three consecutive seasons
(something the Bambino himself never was able to do), he executes
the part.
</P>
<P>
   In a more orderly sports world, McGwire would be out there by
himself. But it's not fiction, is it? It's real life, and here is
Sammy Sosa, not high on anyone's list of Ruth/Maris pursuers prior
to this season, also ready to join the 60 Club. I don't sense that
people are as, you know, offended, by his presence as they were by
that of Maris. Perhaps it's because he brings such a refreshingly
cheerful Latino presence to the party.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey? He is always, always, always a threat. There is a 65
season lurking in his portfolio somewhere, and when it happens, he
will likewise be universally applauded.
</P>
<P>
   The home run record represents the convergence of a peculiarly
American obsession, record keeping, with that of a peculiarly
American myth, Babe Ruth. I read the other day where a leading
London sports bookie says he never even heard of Mark McGwire. Of
course. This is about nobody on earth but Us.

BRUINS SIGN RIGHT WING, DEFENSEMAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Bruins added some depth to their training camp
roster Friday, signing right wing Joel Trottier to a three-year
contract and defenseman Terry Virtue to a one-year deal.
</P>
<P>
   Trottier, 21, was taken by Boston in the seventh round of the
1997 entry draft and Virtue, 27, was an unrestricted free agent.
</P>
<P>
   Trottier played his final year of junior hockey in the Ontario
League last season. With Plymouth, he had 10 points in 10 games. He
was traded to Belleville and finished the season with 23 goals and
55 points in 43 games. In 10 postseason games, he had five goals
and 11 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trottier is an excellent prospect for us,'' said assistant
general manager Mike O'Connell. ``He's a terrific skater with an
offensive flair who had three 20-plus goal seasons, including one
40-goal season in four years of junior hockey.
</P>
<P>
   ``The signing of Virtue addresses our desire for more depth in
the organization, particularly on defense. He's been a solid
American League player for the past several seasons and he plays a
rugged, physical style.''
</P>
<P>
   Virtue, 27, who had 34 points and 233 penalty minutes in 74
games with Worcester, has been earmarked for Providence.

HARSHBARGER SAYS HE'LL SUE TO PRESERVE DRUG BENEFITS FOR SENIORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX PHAM  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Attorney General Scott Harshbarger is ready to sue to
preserve unlimited prescription drug benefits for Massachusetts
seniors, a position that could set state and federal authorities on
a collision course over the popular state law.
</P>
<P>
   Harshbarger's office Friday said he would fight to prevent
federal Medicare authorities from pre-empting the Massachusetts law
that forces insurers to offer the benefit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scott Harshbarger is prepared to take the matter to court to
preserve the state's right to require this benefit for
Massachusetts seniors,'' said Barbara Anthony, chief of the
attorney general's public protection bureau. ``We will do
everything in our power to fight this. It is a very critical
benefit for seniors.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal authorities recently issued a letter suggesting that a
federal law passed under the 1997 Balanced Budget Act prevents
Massachusetts from requiring that Medicare health maintenance
organizations offer unlimited drug benefits. The federal
pre-emption would affect only Medicare HMOs, and would not apply to
Medex and other Medicare supplemental policies. Massachusetts is
the only state in the nation that requires unlimited precription
drug coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Anticipating a possible end to the state mandate, some HMOs have
submitted for federal approval plans with limited drug benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress and the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA)
are granted the exclusive right to determine benefits,'' said
Nancy-Ann Min DeParle, administrator of HCFA, in a letter to
Harshbarger. ``Therefore, under the statute, states cannot specify
what must be included as a Federal Medicare benefit ....''
</P>
<P>
   The letter, though dated Aug. 22, was received by Harshbarger's
office Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Any litigation would be a long time in coming, however, because
the federal rule would not be final until the end of September at
the earliest. Meanwhile, HCFA is accepting public comment until
Sept. 24 on the federal rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not tomorrow, next week, or even a month from now,
because the comment period doesn't expire until Sept. 24,'' Anthony
said. ``There is always the possibility that federal
authorities &UR;  &LR; could change their minds and avert this collision
course.''
</P>
<P>
   Tufts Health Plan, Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, and Blue Cross
and Blue Shield of Massachusetts are among the plans that have said
they plan to introduce limited drug benefits. About 211,000 seniors
in the state belong to an HMO.

KEITH JACKSON: THE LEGEND OF THE FALL MAKES HIS LAST CALL
</HEADLINE>
 (REPEAT SEND) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Burt Harrison doesn't pretend to deserve any
credit for how Keith Jackson turned out as a sportscaster.
</P>
<P>
   But the 81-year-old former professor from Washington State
College's school of radio broadcasting (it didn't include TV then)
did know one thing. This kid, who in the early '50s barged into his
office and demanded he be given a shot at doing play-by-play on the
campus radio station, would never embarrass himself behind a
microphone.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (ital)had(end ital) it, there's no getting around that ...
He was a good, hard-working student, very colorful, a hell of a
broadcaster even then, and a nut about doing sports,'' Harrison
said of the 20-year-old who had just left the Marines and had
enlisted at the school in Pullman, Wash., later to be named
Washington State University.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's academic pursuit then was in police science, or what
today is known as criminal justice. Somewhere inside he admits was
a sportscaster he didn't know about waiting to emerge.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sort of lured him away,'' Harrison said, without much
regret.
</P>
<P>
   The only regret college football fans have this season is this
will be the last for Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   College football (ital)is(end ital) Keith Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   He's been doing games since he was a sophomore at Washington
State in 1952 _ his first was the Cougars' 14-13 loss to Bob
Mathias' Stanford team. He has missed just one season, that to be
the first play-by-play man on ``Monday Night Football.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, who turns 70 in October, begins his final ``Whoa,
Nellie!'' tour with Monday's Kickoff Classic in New Jersey between
Florida State and Texas A&AMP;M. His final two broadcasts are the Jan.
1 Rose Bowl and the Jan. 4 Fiesta Bowl, which this year guarantees
a No. 1 vs. No. 2 matchup.
</P>
<P>
   When his 32nd season doing college football at ABC ends, he'll
have called nearly 500 games, making cities like Tuscaloosa, Ala.,
and Ann Arbor, Mich., seem like magic places on Saturday mornings
in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everyone realized I'm just getting to be an old
goat,'' Jackson said Thursday, when asked if anyone has tried to
talk him out of retirement. ``It's not a sudden thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want a farewell tour. I know it could be emotional.
I'm an old Marine and I'm pretty crusty. When I'm backed into a
corner, I can crack and break. I don't want this to be a
distraction. I probably should have kept my mouth shut.''
</P>
<P>
   If that had happened, he would have never gotten into the
business.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, son of dirt farmers in western Georgia, actually rode a
horse to high school. He was the freshman class president at WSC
and drove a garbage truck for $4 an hour for pocket money. He was
sitting in a dorm room one day listening to a game on KWSC, the
5,000-watt student-run station.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can do a better job than that guy,'' Jackson thought.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson rumbled over to Harrison's office at the campus studio.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can do a better job than that guy,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   Harrison, with a cigarette hanging out of the corner of his
mouth as he was pounding out a manuscript on his Underwood
typewriter, looked up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to hear that (expletive),'' Harrison said,
handing him a tape recorder and a few cassettes. ``Go do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson covered a high school game, came back with the tape and
was hired to work at the station.
</P>
<P>
   Upon his graduation in '54, he worked for 10 years at Seattle TV
station KOMO and moved to Sherman Oaks in 1964 to become a radio
news correspondent and sports director at ABC Radio West. Two years
later, he was doing college football for the network.
</P>
<P>
   Nine years each with Bud Wilkinson and Frank Broyles as his
partner, one with Ara Parseghian and the last dozen with Bob Griese
at his side, Jackson's down-home style has made an imprint on the
game that viewers will likely never feel again in this era of
half-billion-dollar TV contracts and high-stake coalitions.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, always outspoken about his dislike of the
commercialization of the sport, is never shy about promoting it as
well. Somehow, he can get away with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``People always accuse me of selling it and promoting it,'' said
Jackson. ``I'm not a journalist. How can I be? We're not going on
the air to say this game is a bad product. We're in this fix
because of the money we (in TV) brought to it.''
</P>
<P>
   If that's the case, Jackson's annual low-key sales pitch will
definitely be missed. And he'll miss it in return.
</P>
<P>
   ``College football has become a festival with the flavor and
ambiance,'' he said. ``It's about the band with 300 students who
all have mommas and daddies from little towns. It's a happy
setting, not like some sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had more fun than anyone on these games. If I've helped
people enjoy the telecast, that's fine. That's my purpose. If a guy
blows a thousand bucks on a color TV, he doesn't care what I have
to say.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, the game is sacred.''
</P>
<P>
   Amen.
</P>
<P>
   SIDEBAR: JACKSON CAN'T EMBRACE HIS `WHOA NELLIE'
</P>
<P>
   For the record, Keith Jackson's wife of 46 years is named Turi
Ann. Not Nellie.
</P>
<P>
   And the phrase ``Whoa Nellie!'' is something he credits _ or
blames _ sportscaster Roy Firestone for pinning on him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't even begin to think of when I could have said that,
and I know I've said some pretty dumb things,'' said Jackson when
asked about the two words that anyone who mimicks him seems to
repeat the most.
</P>
<P>
   ``Know what? I don't even think about it too much. I don't think
I have a staple phrase. I only use it (during games) now when
(broadcast partner) Bob Griese goaded me into doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Dick Lane used it during roller derby and wrestling broadcasts
from the Olympic Auditorium on KTLA back in the '50s, but Jackson
thinks it somehow got pinned on him by those who do imitations of
him, such as Firestone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I did say it,'' he admits, ``but I had a mule that was
named Pearl.''
</P>
<P>
   Not Nellie.
</P>
<P>
   STATION BREAK:
</P>
<P>
   WHAT SMOKES:
</P>
<P>
   -- A Pepperdine alumnus done good. Bob Weir, a quick, funny and
popular morning sports anchor at WGN in Chicago, will soon fill the
role of overpaid and overemphasized sports guy at KABC Channel 7.
The hiring effectively eliminates not only the incredibly smart but
painfully annoying Todd Donoho (who is free to pursue his game-show
career) but also the not-so-quick Rick Lozano from the rotation.
Until Weir arrives, Donoho will continue to do the extremely
irritating ``Monday Night Live'' postgame time-filler after each
ABC ``Monday Night Football'' game, an often unsuccessful attempt
by the station each week to keep at least half the 20-rating
audience generated by the game. Weir expects to be through at WGN
by next Friday.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT CHOKES:
</P>
<P>
   -- Last season, USC had 14 affiliates on the radio broadcast
network. This week, the school announced it has a whopping four for
the upcoming season _ including another one in L.A. In addition to
the XTRA-AM (690) flagship, Trojans football will compete with
itself on the city's One-on-One Sports station, KCTD-AM (1540).
Will the signal be better in the San Fernando Valley now? We'll
see. USC can also be heard on KGEO-AM (1230) in Bakersfield,
KYNO-AM (1300) in Fresno and KDEF-AM (1150) in Albuquerque, N.M.,
if, by some unfortunate circumstance, you happen to be driving
through Bakersfield, Fresno or Albuquerque.
</P>
<P>
   -- XTRA's other station, AM-1150, can't be heard in
Riverside/San Bernardino, even though it's within 30 miles of the
transmitter. So the Dodgers games have been farmed out to
Riverside's AM-1440 station. It's an all-Spanish station, by the
way.

JAPANESE STOCKS DROP BY $241 BILLION IN A WEEK 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF and SHERYL WuDUNN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ One statistic on Friday evening stands out as an
explanation of the importance of Japan, along with its misery:
</P>
<P>
   When trading ended Friday at the Tokyo Stock Exchange, Japanese
stocks this week alone had dropped in value by $241 billion _ a sum
that exceeds the size of the entire annual output of the Russian
economy at present exchange rates. In other words, in one glum
week's work, Japan managed the financial equivalent of erasing
Russia from the world map for a year.
</P>
<P>
   Japan is so monumental as to be central to the health of the
global economy, but for now it remains a mess. A month after Prime
Minister Keizo Obuchi took office, vowing ``to deal with each issue
in a dramatic, speedy way,'' Japan remains firmly in recession and
largely paralyzed politically and economically.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market fell 3.5 percent Friday to its lowest level
since 1986, while long-term bond yields tumbled to 1.07 percent.
They are the lowest long-term interest rates in recorded history,
having recently fallen below the previous record low rate of 1.125
percent offered by the Italian city-state of Genoa in 1619.
</P>
<P>
   The markets are tumbling because for all Obuchi's pledges, Japan
is in even greater political gridlock than usual. Obuchi's ruling
Liberal Democratic Party has never been described as energetic,
except by itself, but these days even its modest plans to revive
the banking system are being blocked by opposition parties in the
Diet, or Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   The upshot is that the six bills that represent the centerpiece
of Obuchi's plans to revive the economy remain stuck in numbing
Diet hearings. Officials acknowledge that it will be difficult to
win passage of the bills by the time Obuchi meets President Clinton
for a mini-summit meeting in New York planned for around Sept. 21,
and the delays and stalemate are further dispiriting the markets
here and around the world.
</P>
<P>
   In short, expectations of Obuchi were low, and he has met them.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the long term, the Japanese situation is in some ways even
worse than the Russian situation, particularly given the size of
the Japanese economy and the seeming inability to take really
serious action,'' said M.Y. Yoshino, a Harvard Business School
professor who is an expert on Japan and is now visiting Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   Yoshino noted that for all the vast scale of the bad bank debts
in Japan _ perhaps five times the size of the entire Russian market
before its collapse _ there is little move toward dramatic
restructuring to restore sustained economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   A banking analyst at ING Barings Securities Japan Ltd. in Tokyo,
James Fiorillo, penned a bit of verse that captures the mood here.
It begins:
</P>
<P>
   ``'Twas the night before crisis
</P>
<P>
   And behind the Diet border
</P>
<P>
   Not a creature was stirring,
</P>
<P>
   To restore financial order.''
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi and his aides have been defending their conduct, but the
defenses have only added to the impression that the government does
not have the same sense of urgency as the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, for example, Obuchi was scolded in Parliament by a
prominent economist, Yoshio Suzuki, who accused the government of
adopting economic measures that were _ he switched to English _
``too little, too late.''
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi, who by all accounts is an exceptionally friendly and
genial man, grinned and replied that if anything, his efforts had
been _ here he switched to English _ ``too much, too fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told reporters after stocks
tumbled Friday: ``This isn't something to panic about. With the
passage of time, the market will stabilize again.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Miyazawa and Obuchi are trying to reassure the public,
but to some it comes across as complacency. Officials have been
reassuring ever since Japan's ``bubble economy'' burst in about
1991, and yet declining asset values have steadily erased more than
$5 trillion in wealth, equivalent to wiping out half the entire
value of all the stocks on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, this is the worst scenario,'' warned Masaru Takagi,
an economist at Meiji University, referring to the plodding
approach by the government and the stalemate in Parliament. Takagi
estimated that there is a 50 percent chance the Obuchi government
will collapse and be forced to call fresh elections, delaying any
further moves to revive Japan's economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no time to waste, so we must avoid a general election
this year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition parties, however, seeing blood in the water, are
circling eagerly and insisting that this is just the time for
general elections to break the deadlock, instead of waiting for two
more years until elections are due.
</P>
<P>
   ``General elections should come fast,'' said Suzuki, the
economist, who is now a member of Parliament for the opposition
Liberal Party. ``We're now in a standstill, and in that case no
bills may pass the Diet, and economic and financial crises may
occur.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, Obuchi's government is weak in part because of
constant complaining by critics at home and abroad, especially in
the U.S. Treasury Department, who want Japan to act far more
decisively to address its economic problems. But the criticism has
so weakened the government that it is less able than ever to push
through economic measures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some substantial initiative needs to be taken by the
government,'' said Takeshi Sasaki, a political scientist at Tokyo
University. ``It is the responsibility of the government, or it can
be the end of the Obuchi government.''
</P>
<P>
   The opposition usually does not matter much in the Japanese
Parliament, but the main opposition leader, Naoto Kan, has crafted
a broad and relatively unified front that has blocked the
government's proposals and offered its own. Some economists think
Kan's financial plan is better than the government's, because it
insists on more bank disclosure, but there are also criticisms that
Kan is playing politics with Japan's economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``The opposition sees a chance to force the government down,
even if it happens to bring the economy down,'' said Richard
Jerram, an economist at ING Barings Securities Japan Ltd.
``Politicians are oblivious to things in the real world, it's
pretty clear.''
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi clearly wants to have the bills passed by the time he
meets Clinton, and one Cabinet official said the prime minister
would meet opposition leaders soon to work out a compromise. The
fall in global markets may increase the pressure on both sides to
work out a deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we were not a parliamentary democracy, of course we would
be able to make progress on many issues, but that's not the case,''
said Akitaka Saiki, a spokesman for Obuchi. ``If you call this
paralysis, that could be one reason.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he thought the West was too impatient for results,
considering that Obuchi has been in office for only one month,
Saiki scarcely paused.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not just the West,'' he said glumly. ``Everyone is a bit
impatient.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens in Parliament, the situation is not entirely
bleak. Above all, before Obuchi took office the Parliament passed a
huge fiscal stimulus package, which will trickle through the
economy this fall and generate some growth.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Obuchi does not dramatically liberalize the economy _
and almost no one thinks that is a realistic possibility _ the
stimulus itself and some associated tax cuts will lend a healthy
boost.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, much of Japan's economic problem arises from a nearly
universal gloom that makes everyone reluctant to buy or invest.
That psychology is impossible to predict, but some optimists
believe that the fiscal stimulus could restore growth, change the
public mood, and restore the economy to life. That, if it happened,
should revive the property and stock markets, and many bad loans
would become good again.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pessimism,'' said Richard Koo, chief economist at Nomura
Research Institute in Tokyo, ``has been going too far.''

RAYTHEON, ELECTRICIANS SEEK CONTRACT AGREEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE E. LEWIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WALTHAM, Mass. _ With the expiration of the current contract set
for Saturday night, Raytheon Co. and its electrical union continued
talks Friday in an attempt to reach an agreement and ease tensions
among workers at the firm's manufacturing plants.
</P>
<P>
   Although they have not taken a strike authorization vote,
members of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers
Local 1505 could do so following the expiration of their three-year
pact at 12:01 a.m. Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are tired of concessions,'' said union steward Charles
D. Lake during a midafternoon break outside Raytheon's Waltham
plant Friday. ``Last year, they gave up a lot. Now, they want to
see what Raytheon has to offer.''
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon spokeswoman Toni Simonetti said both sides appear to be
making progress at the bargaining table. She declined, however, to
discuss details or sticking points.
</P>
<P>
   ``We make progress everyday,'' Simonetti said.``I cannot
predict what will happen this weekend, but we are hopeful we will
reach an agreement and that the (union) membership will approve.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At the same time,'' she added, ``we are prepared for any
outcome. We are prepared for a work stoppage in the event we do not
reach an agreement. There are three scenarios: We have a contract
everybody approves of; we extend negotiations and they work without
a contract, or they strike... We won't know which of those will
occur until Sunday morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Union officials did not return telephone calls Friday. However,
leaflets passed out to various members Friday noted that progress
had been made on job security, overtime, and training. The union,
which is seeking a wage hike and an end to the current two-tier
wage scale, said little progress had been made in that area.
</P>
<P>
   Some 2,000 members are expected to meet in Lowell at 8 a.m.
Sunday to discuss the status of talks and the provisions of a
company &UR;  &LR; contract proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions have risen among workers in recent months with the
announcements of layoffs at various Raytheon sites in
Massachusetts. In June, Raytheon confirmed the layoffs of 1,500
employees at its engineering and construction unit in Cambridge.
The unit, hard hit by reductions in defense industry contracts, saw
500 more layoffs than the company had proposed in January.

   Also this summer, news that 261 factory jobs would be cut due to
defense contract reductions sparked protests at Raytheon plants in
Andover, Waltham, and Quincy.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, union members said they had agreed to a wage freeze
and other concessions in the past so that Raytheon would stay in
Massachusetts and maintain jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon is one of the state's largest employers. It has
facilities in 10 communities with 15,400 employees in
Massachusetts.

CROP INITIATIVE A RARE VICTORY IN COLOMBIA'S WAR ON DRUGS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: Goes with Colombia-Heroin-U.S.) 
 
By JOHN OTIS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITAYO, Colombia _ Pointing to the green patches of potatoes and
corn that surround this Paez Indian village, Jairo Soscue said the
landscape once reflected a different hue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything was red with poppies,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As a small cog in Colombia's booming heroin trade, hundreds of
Paez Indians in Pitayo until recently grew opium poppies and sold
their narcotic-laden gum to drug dealers.
</P>
<P>
   But the crimson blossoms became a curse. Poppy farmers
squandered their earnings. Pitayo was plagued by shootings and
public drunkenness.
</P>
<P>
   Alarmed tribal elders decided that the flowers had to go. They
persuaded growers to uproot their poppies and to plant traditional
crops.
</P>
<P>
   Now, 10 months later, the initiative appears to represent a rare
victory in Colombia's war on drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The opium poppy was introduced to Colombia in the mid-1980s by
drug lords from Southeast Asia. Today, the country's heroin exports
are surging. According to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration,
52 percent of the heroin seized in the United States in 1996 was
Colombian.
</P>
<P>
   The flowers spread to Pitayo through Paez Indians who worked as
migrant coffee pickers. Members of the now-defunct Medellin drug
cartel persuaded them to experiment with the new seeds back home in
the rugged Andes mountains, where the climate for growing opium
poppies is ideal.
</P>
<P>
   At first, the poppies seemed like a dream cash crop. Growers cut
small incisions in the flower pods and extracted milky-white opium
gum, which drug traffickers turned into heroin. From one acre of
flowers, farmers could earn up to $1,500 per harvest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We Indians know a lot about agriculture, and this was very
easy to grow,'' said Soscue, who was elected governor of the Paez
last year. Drug merchants ``would pay in advance and say, `In four
or five months I'll be back for the entire crop.'''
</P>
<P>
   Yet new wealth led to new problems.
</P>
<P>
   Food had to be purchased at town markets, because farmers had
abandoned subsistence crops. Children quit school to work in the
fields. And with so many people focused on profits, the tradition
of communal work projects was lost.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of saving their money, many poppy growers splurged on
motorcycles, fancy clothes, pistols and cane alcohol. More than a
dozen Indians were killed in drug disputes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young people began to drink and throw money around,'' said
Omaira Mostacilla, a town official in Pitayo. ``A lot of the women
complained, because they had to take care of five or six kids by
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People never learned how to manage their money,'' Soscue
added. ``They would go to the cantinas not for any old drink, but
for five-star brandy. That's when the big problems began, and
people began to kill each other.''
</P>
<P>
   That's also when members of the Paez tribal council began
looking for a way out. They found an answer in a nearby Guambia
Indian village. People there had voluntarily eradicated 1,250 acres
of poppies with the help of PLANTE, a government agency that
provides credits and technical support to farmers who abandon drug
crops.
</P>
<P>
   The Paez signed up for a similar project that included $285,000
in low-cost loans to help farmers plant soybeans, onions, corn and
potatoes and to set up small businesses. The credit was critical,
because few banks in Colombia lend to poor farmers.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, hundreds of machete-wielding Indians attacked their
poppies one morning last October. Within hours, they had cut down
the village's entire crop.
</P>
<P>
   A few disgruntled growers left Pitayo, and the tribal council
received threatening letters from heroin traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   Though a few rows of red flowers have sprouted again, most
residents seem committed to the plan.
</P>
<P>
   The switch to legal crops ``can't just be an issue of money,
because drug money will always be greater,'' said Nelson Melo,
director of the regional PLANTE office. ``But if it's a
quality-of-life issue, drug money loses its significance.''
</P>
<P>
   Up until now, anti-drug efforts in the Colombian countryside
have focused almost entirely on forced eradication of opium poppies
and coca, the raw material for cocaine, by police crop-dusters
funded by the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
   But Klaus Nyholm, who heads the United Nations' International
Drug Control Program in Colombia, insists that alternative crop
projects deserve more support. &UR;  &LR; ``It hasn't reached the size where
it really matters,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia's new president, Andres Pastrana, seems to agree. In
his Aug. 7 inauguration speech, he said the nation must build
roads, power plants and other infrastructure to help wean peasants
off drug crops. Even Washington is warming up to the idea.
</P>
<P>
   A senior State Department official said that massive aerial
spraying will continue but added that the Clinton administration
will consider supporting some of Pastrana's initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   Nyholm said that alternative crop projects work especially well
in close-knit Indian villages, where tribal authorities are highly
respected.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, there is little sense of community among pioneer
farmers in the jungles of southern Colombia, where thousands of
acres of coca are grown and where many people live too far from
towns to sell legal crops.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Guambia and the Paez, who live just a few miles from
major cities, ``are still in the struggling phase,'' Nyholm said.
</P>
<P>
   Due to a bureaucratic snafu, just half of the PLANTE loan money
for Pitayo has arrived. While farmers make the transition to legal
crops, residents rely on U.N. food donations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Colombia is a country of good, healthy peasants, but they need
help`` said Melo, the PLANTE director. ``If there are alternatives,
I'm sure that they would accept them.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we only offer them laws and prohibitions,'' he said, ``we
are not helping at all.''

   KINSHASA, Congo _ Damase Kava-Zumbu first heard about what his
nephew had done when he walked into his courtyard a couple of weeks
ago, a few days after rebels launched an attack against the
government here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonton's gone and volunteered,'' one of his children told him.
</P>
<P>
   Later, he sat down with his nephew. ``Are you aware of what
you've done?'' asked the uncle, a thoughtful, university-educated
agronomist. The nephew answered that he was eager to defend his
country against foreign invaders.
</P>
<P>
   The uncle asked nothing else, even though he knew the young man
would go to war with almost no training, in part because he agreed
with his simple reasoning, in part because he barely knew him. A
younger sister of Kava-Zumbu's had sent her son away from the
family's ancestral village to live with his uncle here in La Cite,
the sprawling collection of dilapidated neighborhoods south of
Kinshasa's business and diplomatic center.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in his uncle's courtyard, leaning toward his
grandmother, who everyone knew spoiled him, the nephew, Tonton
Miaka, now waited for the government to hand him a uniform and an
AK-47.
</P>
<P>
   A quiet, impassive man of 24, Miaka let slip a faint smile only
when he recalled that since he had volunteered, the youths in the
neighborhood had begun saluting him and calling him Mokonzi,
``chief'' in the local dialect.
</P>
<P>
   Kinshasa is filled these days with young men who have
volunteered to join the army, compelled by vague notions of duty
and the unshakable belief that Congo has been attacked by the hated
Tutsi and their Rwandan backers. Each morning, except on Sundays,
they can be seen milling around La Cite's sports stadiums, waiting
to join the military or to begin their drills.
</P>
<P>
   The young men _ many are just teen-agers _ are the foot soldiers
in the Congolese government's notoriously unprofessional and
disorganized army. Many in the first wave of volunteers who left
for the rebel-held areas southwest of here were killed by mistake
two weeks ago when they ran into another group of government
soldiers from the south.
</P>
<P>
   Reports of the deaths reached Kinshasa and Miaka's training was
put on hold for more than a week. But he was called back to duty on
Saturday and on Monday, at 7 a.m., he resumed his training after
walking the two miles from his uncle's house to the nearest sports
center, the Stadium of Martyrs.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the first group got killed, some volunteers changed
their minds and tried to discourage me,'' he said, leaning forward
in his chair, rubbing his leg with his hand. ``But I'm determined
to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Tonton Miaka has no military experience, having spent half his
life growing onions and cabbage back in the village. With few
prospects there, he came to Kinshasa and, with some seed money from
his grandmother, started a small business selling cigarettes at the
local market.
</P>
<P>
   The young man lived at his uncle's, in a squat house with
cinder-block walls and a thin tin roof. The family moved into the
house in 1948, said Kava-Zumbu, 55, in a neighborhood called
Ngiri-Ngiri that was one of the last areas built by the former
Belgian colonizers.
</P>
<P>
   The family's fortunes fell under the ruinous, 32-year
dictatorship of Mobutu Sese Seko. While Kava-Zumbu benefited from
what was once considered one of the best educational systems on the
continent, his nephew did not study beyond age 12. The uncle, who
worked as an agronomist for the government and spent 12 years in
the eastern Congo, also fell on hard times. His salary eroded under
soaring inflation and eventually, like many government workers, he
was not paid at all.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, the uncle _ along with his wife, their six children,
his mother and the nephew _ makes ends meet by renting rooms in the
house to two families, taking in a total of $70 a month. His
mother, an indomitable woman in her 80s who can be found sitting or
lying in the sand-swept courtyard all day, supplements the family
income by peeling sunflower seeds. She mashes the seeds into oil
and sells them at a stand in front of the house, or sometimes at
the local market.
</P>
<P>
   It was at that market, where Tonton Miaka was selling an average
of six packs of Ambassade cigarettes a day, that he first heard
that the army was taking volunteers. ``I wanted to go right away,''
he said, but he decided to wait until he told his grandmother that
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``You won't be the first soldier in our family,'' his
grandmother, Veronique M'landu, recalled telling him, explaining
that five of her grandsons had now joined the army. ``Go defend the
country. Don't loot. Behave yourself like a man.''
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, wearing jeans and running shoes, he went to
the Stadium of Martyrs and enrolled. For the next 10 days, Miaka
and hundreds like him went through drills inside the stadium and
sang songs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You Rwandans, God has not chosen you,'' Miaka said, recalling
a song. ``If you want dialogue, we'll have dialogue. If you want
war, we'll have war.''
</P>
<P>
   His uncle, who went to university instead of the army, shook his
head. ``He gave up everything,'' he said with a laugh. ``He shaved
his head, a la Kabila. He spent all the money he'd earned. He gave
some of it away and feasted on the rest of it.''
</P>
<P>
   But like many educated Congolese here, Kava-Zumbu has
complicated feelings about the war. He is weary of it. But he is
steadfastly behind efforts by President Laurent Kabila to push back
the rebels, who are led by ethnic Tutsi from eastern Congo and who
are widely supposed to have the backing of Rwanda and Uganda, two
countries that helped propel Kabila to power less than two years
ago but then grew disenchanted with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``They call Kabila a buffoon and say that he doesn't have the
profile of a president,'' the uncle said bitterly. ``This is a
sovereign country, isn't it?''
</P>
<P>
   The family is united behind the young man.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very proud,'' the grandmother said. ``I'm not worried.''
</P>
<P>
   But each morning, after her grandson had left the house for the
Stadium of the Martyrs, Kava-Zumbu said, he noticed something
unusual. ``Every morning,'' he said, ``she cried.''

COLOMBIAN DRUG DEALERS TAKING CONTROL OF HEROIN TRADE IN U.S. 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN OTIS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia _ Thirty years ago, major heroin shipments
entered the United States through the infamous ``French
Connection,'' which funneled narcotics made from Turkish opium in
French laboratories to crime families in New York.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Colombia is the connection for many of the estimated
2 million heroin users in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In the past four years, Colombian drug dealers have moved from
being marginal players in the heroin trade to controlling an
estimated 52 percent of the U.S. market, according to Donnie
Marshall, acting deputy administrator of the U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration.
</P>
<P>
   The Colombians' sales plan? Sell high-quality merchandise at low
prices.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s and 1980s, the average purity level of heroin sold
on U.S. streets ranged from 2 percent to 7 percent, experts say.
But much of the Colombian heroin is 80 percent to 99 percent pure,
and it can be smoked or snorted rather than injected. That
increases the drug's appeal to first-time and casual users, who
want to avoid dirty needles and the threat of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are pushing high-grade heroin onto the streets at
extremely low prices in a bid to wrest market share from Middle
Eastern and Mexican traffickers,'' Marshall said in testimony
before the House International Relations Committee on June 24.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Marshall said, Colombians routinely sell heroin for
$90,000 a kilogram, compared to $150,000 to $200,000 per kilogram
for lower-grade Southeast Asian heroin. Many Colombian traffickers
require wholesale customers to accept heroin along with cocaine as
a condition of doing business.
</P>
<P>
   The sophisticated Colombian cartels that once controlled the
cocaine trade sent planeloads of the drug north.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, independent heroin traffickers based in the
Colombian cities of Bogota and Medellin and in the country's
west-central coffee-growing region move a few kilograms at a time,
experts say. They export their heroin by using express-mail
packages, false-sided luggage and airline passengers, who ingest
heroin-filled balloons and condoms.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these ``swallowers'' are shuttled through Venezuela or
Central America to disguise their country of origin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Heroin traffickers are very savvy and very flexible,''
Marshall told the House Committee. ``They adapt quickly, varying
their routes and methodology to limit the success of law
enforcement.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the drug reaches the United States, he said, Colombians
often enlist Dominican gangs, who also deal in cocaine, to make
connections with midlevel wholesalers and retailers.
</P>
<P>
   That reduces the risk for the Colombians, a key concern
following the dismantling of the Medellin and Cali cocaine cartels
in the early 1990s.

 &HT;    Once homeless, teen heads to college
 &HT;    By Ernie Suggs
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- With her white T-shirt and baggy jeans, Venus
Rodriguez looks the part of any 18-year-old Clark Atlanta
University freshman.
</P>
<P>
   But beneath the pleasant smile is a hardened woman-child who
refuses to mince words about her life in a homeless shelter or with
a drug-addicted mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the age of 15, I had been through things that 30-year-olds
couldn't dream of,'' Rodriguez said. ``I was homeless, went to 11
different schools, was in foster care. I want people to be inspired
by my story.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez's story enters a new chapter today, when her freshman
classes begin at Clark Atlanta, where she plans to major in mass
communications.
</P>
<P>
   Almost by accident, Rodriguez has gone from a homeless teen who
watched her father beat her mother to a voice for the young and
homeless. She was appointed by San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown to
the city's Youth Commission and the San Francisco Homeless Board.
She worked at the YMCA as a coordinator for a mentorship program
and worked in the district attorney's office as an outreach worker
for teen girls.
</P>
<P>
   Major newspapers and national magazines have told her story and
in March 1999, PBS will air a documentary on her life. All of that
caught the attention of the United Negro College Fund, which
awarded her the full scholarship that she will use at Clark
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez's story actually begins in New York, where her mother,
Katrina Powell, hooked up with a man with whom she would spend nine
years.
</P>
<P>
   But, Powell said, the man beat her throughout their
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Tired of the constant beatings, Powell packed up her daughter
and moved to San Francisco in 1987. But after only two years, she
returned to her boyfriend. The beatings started again.
</P>
<P>
   Powell, who said she became addicted to crack in 1987, left for
California for good in December 1992. With no job or prospects, no
place to live, Powell and Rodriguez, 12, spent Christmas and the
next five months in a homeless shelter.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez initially was numbed by the thought of moving into a
shelter. She talked to few children her age, instead spending time
with adults.
</P>
<P>
   ``People always ask me, `How was it there?' I dealt with it. I
love to read, and I used my survival skills. Living in a shelter is
a matter of survival. I had to do this. I had to get it done.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, while still in the shelter, Rodriguez was in a group of
kids that visited President Clinton at the White House. The
13-year-old asked the president what he was going to do to end
homelessness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a very outspoken young person,'' Rodriguez said. ``When
there is an injustice, you should speak out about it. As soon as I
rose out of homelessness, I wanted to talk about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton sent her a personal letter thanking her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came back disillusioned, because I still came back to a
shelter,'' Rodriguez said. ``I was still homeless. I got
recognition; I got a letter from Clinton; but so what? I don't rely
on political promises. I have been let down too many times
already.''
</P>
<P>
   In April 1993, Powell and Rodriguez landed in a transitional
home for low-income families.
</P>
<P>
   One day in early June, Powell left the home _ and didn't come
back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had $5, so I was fine,'' said Rodriguez, who would get up
every morning and go to middle school, where she had a 3.5 grade
point average. ``When people asked me where was my mother, I said
she went to the store; she'd be right back. I convinced myself that
she would be right back.''
</P>
<P>
   But surveillance cameras reported no signs of Powell coming or
going from the home.
</P>
<P>
   On the third day, June 3, Rodriguez was pulled out of school by
her principal, a police officer and a social worker, who took her
home to pack her belongings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started crying, because I didn't know what was going on,''
Rodriguez said. ``I thought they were just doing this to scare my
mom, and that I would be with her. I didn't know that they were
sending me to a foster home.''
</P>
<P>
   Powell arrived as Rodriguez was on her way to a foster home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so drug-addicted, I abandoned her,'' Powell said. ``I
remember she had been crying so much that her eyes were like two
puff balls, but she was so courageous. ... She was the adult, and I
was immature.''
</P>
<P>
   Going to a foster home was upsetting, Rodriguez said. ``In the
beginning it was hard. I cried a lot, and I was worried about my
mother.''
</P>
<P>
   While in foster care, Rodriguez met Naomi Gray through the
Sojourner Truth Foster Family Service Agency, a nonprofit
organization she helped establish. Gray got Powell into a drug
treatment center and paved the way for Rodriguez to attend the
prestigious and mostly white French-American International School
on scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the first time I met Venus, I was struck by her attitude
and the way she handled herself,'' said Gray, now the president of
the San Francisco-based urban institute for African-American
affairs. ``She talked about how much she liked school, and I
thought, `Here was a child that needed to be nurtured.' She was
very outgoing and very mature.'' By Aug. 19, 1993, Powell said she
was sober, and after three years in foster care, Rodriguez and her
mother moved into a two-bedroom apartment that Gray secured for
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Foster care was a blessing in disguise,'' Powell said. ``Venus
being taken from me was reason to turn it around. Losing her was
the ultimate bottom.''
</P>
<P>
   As she prepared for her first college classes, first college
boyfriend and first visit to the college cafeteria, Rodriguez
harbors no bitterness for the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back then, I was thinking about survival. About today. I knew
everything would be all right, because things happen for a reason,
and I am stronger for it,'' she said, adding that she even called
her father, whom she hasn't seen since 1992. ``I just decided to
talk to him before leaving for college. But I'm on another level.
He is 40, but still very young.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez said she and her mother haven't spent as much time
with each other this summer as they would have liked. She said the
trip to Atlanta has brought them closer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad we still are friends, because she has never had a
fair break,'' Powell said. ``Without Venus, I couldn't have gotten
sober. ... Her strength and courage made me strong.''

<P>
   MOSCOW _ Boris Yeltsin, reclaiming a bit of his old defiant
nature, insisted on national television Friday night that he would
serve out his term as Russia's president and that, for him,
resignation was impossible.
</P>
<P>
   But rumors and reality alike suggested Friday that his
presidency, if it does last, is rushing toward figurehead status.
</P>
<P>
   In excerpts from an interview broadcast on the RTP television
network, Yeltsin cast himself as once again in command of his
nation's increasingly desperate financial situation. He said new
instructions given to the Central Bank and the government ``spelled
out in detail what should be done'' and would be strictly obeyed.
And he took pains to portray the country's new prime minister,
Victor Chernomyrdin, as a subordinate and not a pretender to his
throne.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has been given as much power as he is entitled to as a
prime minister in any developed country,'' Yeltsin said. ``This was
given to back up strategic tasks. So, consult the president. All
the rest _ you have a free hand. Take decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   But even before he spoke _ slowly, with stilted speech and
almost painful pauses _ his envoy to the powerful Communist bloc in
Russia's lower house of Parliament, the Duma, said Yeltsin had
already agreed to cede key portions of the almost-dictatorial
powers of the Russian presidency.
</P>
<P>
   The president's representative to the Duma, Alexander Kotenkov,
and the Communist Duma speaker, Gennady Seleznyov, said in a news
conference that they had reached broad agreement on a new economic
policy and on changes to the 1993 constitution that is the
foundation of presidential power.
</P>
<P>
   Kotenkov said Yeltsin has agreed to allow the prime minister _
that is, Chernomyrdin _ to name Cabinet ministers and to give the
parliament the right to reject those appointments. Yeltsin also
agreed that Chernomyrdin's government should be given a year's
grace period in which it would be spared political attack, Kotenkov
said.
</P>
<P>
   Either concession would mark a sea change in the generally
autocratic but free-market political ideology that has kept Yeltsin
in power for seven years now. Any serious alliance with the
Communists, who want to re-nationalize industry, increase social
spending and re-establish control of the economy, should be
anathema to western governments and investors who had begun to
build a market economy here.
</P>
<P>
   But a consensus has emerged _ true or not _ that Yeltsin is no
longer in control of his fate, or that of his nation. And there
seems to be growing agreement, even among the country's squabbling
political barons, that Chernomyrdin is just about all that stands
between Mother Russia and the abyss.

DRUG CZAR REVEALS HIS AMAZEMENT AT LACK OF BORDER COORDINATION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDs: Embargoed until Monday, Aug. 31) (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Barry McCaffrey, the nation's director of drug
policy, recalled his astonishment during his first tour of
U.S.-Mexico border crossings two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got 800 people working at these border crossings,'' he
said, pausing for a moment as he leaned forward in his chair and
whispered with wide eyes, ``And nobody's in charge.''
</P>
<P>
   At the checkpoints, McCaffrey saw Immigration and Naturalization
Service agents patrolling some lanes, while U.S. Customs officials
patrolled others. But the INS employees didn't share their findings
with their customs counterparts, he said.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey also discovered that each agency had to follow
separate union rules controlling how its inspectors would search
vehicles. Officials at one agency were actually forbidden to open
the trunks of cars _ a policy well known among drug dealers.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at the cars down the line, McCaffrey could ``see drug
dealers with binoculars watching the various lanes ... to see where
to drive their vehicles to avoid getting caught,'' he said in an
interview in his office last Friday.
</P>
<P>
   According to McCaffrey, drugs will continue to flow unimpeded
across the border until America's federal and state agencies
charged with fighting narcotics begin to work together. He will
stress that point during a two-day visit to San Antonio starting
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing in life works without coordination,'' said the former
four-star general, who directed policy and strategic planning for
the Joint Chiefs of Staff before becoming the nation's drug czar in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Coordination is a crucial component of a plan McCaffrey
announced last Wednesday that would shore up federal anti-drug
efforts along the 2,000-mile U.S.-Mexico border.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, huge portable X-rays machines capable of quickly
scanning entire truck cargoes would be installed at each of the 39
crossings along the Southwest border by 2003. Currently, only six
of the $3.5 million X-rays machines are in place. In addition, the
plan calls for added fences, sensors, video cameras and lighting
along the border.
</P>
<P>
   The plan also calls for boosting the number of border agents
from 12,000 to 22,000.
</P>
<P>
   But the part of the plan that could prove most difficult to
implement may be its call for more efficient use of drug-fighting
personnel. Currently more than 50 federal and state agencies are
involved in fighting narcotics. But the efforts of these agencies
are hampered by poor communication and turf wars.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey's plan would create a regional drug czar, most likely
based in El Paso, to coordinate law enforcement efforts of the 22
agencies most active in the area's anti-narcotics war. The plan
also calls for coordinators at each of the 39 points of entry along
the border, which stretches from Texas to California.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey said he expects the main fight over his Southwest
initiative to come from agency heads reluctant to give up any
control of their employees. The problem, he said, ``will be in
Washington among the departments and in Congress because there are
separate congressional committees that support customs, DEA (Drug
Enforcement Administration), etc.''
</P>
<P>
   DEA and INS officials declined to comment on McCaffrey's
proposal, referring questions to their parent agency, the
Department of Justice.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department spokesman Gregory King said officials there
were ``studying'' the initiative.
</P>
<P>
   Although his plan has received a cool reception in Washington,
McCaffrey said drug-fighting authorities and community leaders in
the Southwest have supported it. ``I've been up and down that
border ... and these people are prepared to move forward.''
</P>
<P>
   The need for a tighter border is clear. More than 60 percent of
the estimated 300 tons of cocaine and more than half of the
methamphetamines and marijuana that enter the country each year are
believed to pass through the U.S.-Mexico border.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Customs Service estimates that current interdiction
efforts stop 10 percent to 20 percent of that drug flow. Local
authorities put the number even lower.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, U.S. officials inspected 900,000 of the 3.7 million
trucks crossing the border. Cocaine was found in only 16 trucks _ a
figure that McCaffrey called ``incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The people working on the border are doing a good job; so it's
not their fault,'' he said. ``We have no choice but to give them
the equipment they need.''
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey said the X-ray machines currently in place have
performed well. ``Essentially it is impossible that I'm not going
to see your two kilograms of heroin if your truck drives into that
machine.''
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey said he didn't know how much money his plan would add
to the $2 billion a year spent on fighting drugs along the
U.S.-Mexico border, but he insisted that whatever the price, it
would be only a fraction of the cost society pays for drug use.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lowest estimate of the cost to society of drug use is
around $110 billion annually,'' he said. ``If we can put even a
dent in that use, we will be saving the country billions of
dollars, not to mention saving a lot of people a lot of pain and
suffering.''

 &HT;    YELTSIN VOWS TO STAY ON, WILL SHARE POWER, AS CRISIS DEEPENS
 &HT;    By CHARLES W. HOLMES
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ A defiant President Boris Yeltsin vowed that Russia's
deepening economic crisis will not force him from office, even as
he warned that tougher times are ahead for the anxious nation.
</P>
<P>
   But underscoring Yeltsin's growing insignificance to the
critical events unfolding in Russia, the real action was taking
place in negotiations between acting Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin and the Communists as the Kremlin offered to share
certain powers with the opposition-led parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Emerging from days of seclusion and silence about his country's
plight, Yeltsin went on national television Friday night to douse
furious rumors that his resignation was imminent.
</P>
<P>
   `I want to say that I'm not going anywhere. I'm not going to
resign. I will work as I'm supposed to for my constitutional
term,'' he said in a taped interview on national television.
</P>
<P>
   `In 2000 there will be an election for a new president and I
will not run.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Chernomyrdin was haggling with the
Communist-controlled Duma.
</P>
<P>
   They compromised on an agreement to enact Soviet-style controls
on the economy in an effort to stem the financial meltdown caused
by mounting public debts, a shaky banking system and the plummeting
ruble.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin also was willing to make several major power-sharing
concessions, including proposed amendments to the 1993
constitution, which granted the president sweeping powers to rule
in most areas without the consent or advice of parliament.
</P>
<P>
   The compromises included giving parliament more influence over
government policy. They were designed to ease the way for
Chernomyrdin's confirmation by the Duma, the lower house of
parliament, which has scheduled to open its debate on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov said talks were
stalled and the
</P>
<P>
   Kremlin offers were ``nothing more than an illusion.'' He
suggested that a vote on Chernomyrdin's confirmation may not take
place until Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   That would leave the country without a government for another
week, prolonging the political uncertainty as Russia's financial
system continues to unravel.
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts fear that a deadlock in negotiations will
only further weaken the ruble and increase the changes of social
unrest.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton is scheduled to hold a summit with Yeltsin in
Moscow on Tuesday and Wednesday, a meeting arranged before Russia's
crisis erupted this month.
</P>
<P>
   Emphasizing the new prominence of the Communists, the U.S.
ambassador to Russia, James Collins, met Friday with Zyuganov in
what may be a precursor to a meeting between the Communists and
Clinton when he visits Moscow next week.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after Yeltsin's videotaped remarks were aired, his chief
legislative adviser confirmed that Yeltsin _ a domineering
president known as ``Czar Boris''
</P>
<P>
   with sweeping powers under the 1993 constitution _ has offered
to grant Chernomyrdin the authority to name his own government and
to give parliament greater role in government appointments.
</P>
<P>
   To the dismay of Western economists, Chernomyrdin and the
Communist Party
</P>
<P>
   leaders in the parliament also agreed to Soviet-style controls
on the economy, erasing elements of free-market capitalism
introduced after the Soviet Union collapsed seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In another symbolic concession to the Communists, Yeltsin on
Friday fired prominent market reformers Anatoly Chubais and Boris
Nemtsov _ the latter
</P>
<P>
   had already resigned.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms being negotiated in an effort to ease the
financial crisis,
</P>
<P>
   the new government and parliament would implement price and
currency controls,
</P>
<P>
   nationalize some banks and companies and print more money
augment the nation's dwindling treasury.
</P>
<P>
   `The overriding goal is to stop the fall of the ruble, not to
allow the destruction of the economy and reduce the damage
sustained by every Russian,'' Chernomyrdin said.
</P>
<P>
   But repressive economic measures are likely to receive a cool
reception from
</P>
<P>
   the United States and other lenders.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said government controls on the economy and more rubles
in circulation
</P>
<P>
   may ease the current crisis for weeks or months, but risk
spawning massive
</P>
<P>
   inflation and social unrest.
</P>
<P>
   ``You will see empty shops and, down the line, starvation,''
predicted Al Breach of the of the Russian-European Center for
Economic Policy. ``This country is not self-sufficient. There is a
complete breakdown of economic order. The infrastructure is
completely rotten and the whole place is living on debt. And now it
is going cold turkey. The long winter will be the real test here.''
</P>
<P>
   The International Monetary Fund is scheduled to deliver a $4.3
billion installment of a $22.6 billion bailout package agree to
last month, however the aid is tied to assurances by the previous
Russian government under Sergei Kiriyenko that it would pursue
economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
   After months of mounting debt and falling financial markets,
Russia devalued the ruble on Aug. 17 and Yeltsin sacked the
Kiriyenko government on Sunday, replacing him with Chernomyrdin,
who had been fired in an earlier government overhaul in March.
</P>
<P>
   The turmoil sent the ruble into a free-fall this week,
plummeting as low as
</P>
<P>
   12.5 to the U.S. dollar from a previous rate of 6.2 to the
dollar two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Russians have mobbed banks seeking to withdrawal their savings
and headed to store to stock up on goods fearing shortages will
follow. Russia's largest jewelry distributor said sales increased
250 percent in the past two weeks as Russian sought to invest their
rubles in gold and silver before the ruble weakened further.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be naive to say that we'll take some steps and people
won't suffer,'' Yeltsin said in his televised remarks.
</P>
<P>
   ``However as president, I must say that we'll take every measure
to ensure that people don't lose their savings. I cannot promise
that prices won't go up, but as president I am obligated to do
everything to keep it to a minimum,'' he added.

 &HT;    RUSSIA'S KEY PLAYERS AS THE COUNTRY ENDURES CHAOS
 &HT;    Moving both the (i) International and (f) Financial categories.
 &HT;    With RUSSIA-CRISIS-0829.
 &HT;    By CHARLES W. HOLMES
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Here are the leading figures in Russia's government,
parliament and business as the country struggles with the current
economic and political crisis:
</P>
<P>
   BORIS YELTSIN, 67, president
</P>
<P>
   Quote: ``I'm not going to resign. I will work as I'm supposed to
for my constitutional term. In 2000 there will be an election for a
new president and I will not run.''
</P>
<P>
   Background: Russia's first democratically elected president was
a political maverick in the old Communist Party. Yeltsin helped
hasten the end of the Soviet Union in 1991 and promised Russia the
rewards of democracy and free markets. Seven years later, the dream
has soured with economic and political chaos and an ailing Yeltsin
viewed as unable to cope with the crisis. While denying he will
resign, Yeltsin has agreed to cede powers to his prime minister and
parliament.
</P>
<P>
   VIKTOR CHERNOMYRDIN, 60, acting prime minister
</P>
<P>
   Quote: ``We must forget (political) ambitions, we must stabilize
the situation and ease tensions that have reached a critical
point.''
</P>
<P>
   Background: A Soviet-era bureaucrat, Chernomyrdin went on to
serve as Yeltsin's prime minister from December 1992 until March
this year, when he was fired for failing to fix the economy. Now
he's back and struggling to form a government and satisfy the
interests of the Communist opposition, Russia's powerful tycoons
and Western lenders urging Russia not to revive a Soviet-style
economy.
</P>
<P>
   GENNADY ZYUGANOV, 54, leader of the Communist Party
</P>
<P>
   Quote: ``We will only support a policy and a leadership that
will clearly and straightforwardly reject the so-called market
reforms and agree to take a different course.''
</P>
<P>
   Background: Leader of the opposition in the Duma, parliament's
lower house, Zyuganov was dismissed as politically impotent after
Yeltsin defeated him in the 1996 presidential race. But Zyuganov's
clout has risen considerably in the past week as he seeks a role
for his party in setting policy and filling key jobs in the new
government. Polls show he is the leading candidate to replace
Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   YEGOR STROYEV, 61, chairman of the Federation Council
</P>
<P>
   Quote: ``We should hurry to create a new government. Lack of any
authority at all is worse than the worst possible regime.''
</P>
<P>
   Background: The lackluster head of Russia's upper house of
parliament, Stroyev largely has served as a go-between for the
Kremlin and the Communist-dominated Duma. Opposition parties have
promoted him as an alternative candidate for prime minister. A
Soviet-era economist, he represents the interests of Russia's
provinces, whose governors sit on the federation council.
</P>
<P>
   YURI LUZHKOV, 62 mayor of Moscow and business tycoon
</P>
<P>
   Quote: ``If the Central Bank lacks either the money or the
desire to halt the crisis, the financial system will slowly crawl
towards destruction.''
</P>
<P>
   Background: The powerful mayor of Moscow -- who like
Chernomyrdin has aspirations to become president -- demonstrated
his status by his attendance in a meeting Friday with Yeltsin,
Chernomyrdin and Stroyev on the fate of Russia. A nationalist who
enjoys strong popularity in Moscow, Luzhkov has distanced himself
from the Kremlin during the current crisis. He could exploit the
current chaos to his political advantage should Chernomyrdin fail
to reverse the economic declines.
</P>
<P>
   ALEXANDER LEBED, 48, governor of the Krasnoyarsk region and a
presidential aspirant.
</P>
<P>
   Quote: ``Over the years, the population has grown poorer and
output has fallen, but the president and government told fairy
tales to Russians instead of taking the necessary steps.''
</P>
<P>
   Background: A tough-as-nails former army general with a popular
following in Russia (he finished third in the 1996 presidential
balloting), Lebed was courted by Chernomyrdin earlier this week in
what many analyst believed was an attempt to have him join the new
government. He likely wants to remain on the outside, though and,
like Luzhkov, attempt to exploit a failure of the new government in
time for the presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   BORIS BEREZOVSKY, 52, industrial and media baron; Yeltsin
advisor
</P>
<P>
   Quote: ``I am a product of privatization.''
</P>
<P>
   Background: A multibillionaire who helped finance Yeltsin's 1996
campaign and went on to become a Kremlin insider, Berezovsky has
emerged as the power behind the throne. Berezovsky is the most
prominent of the wealthy Russians known as the oligarchs, who made
their money buying and selling the assets of the dissolved Soviet
Union. He and others reportedly engineered Chernomyrdin's return to
protect the status quo, fearing economic reform amid the crisis
could dismantle their empires.
</P>
<P>
   ANATOLY CHUBAIS, 43, fired as Yeltsin's chief economic reformer
</P>
<P>
   Quote: ``Even given the present difficult financial situation,
there is no alternative to development of a market economy in
Russia or the country's integration into the world financial
system.''
</P>
<P>
   Background: Fired Friday as from his job as chief financial
liaison to the West, Chubais is an erudite reformer who since 1991
was the main architect of Russia's plan to privatize its Soviet-era
industries. He is the darling of Western economists, but is blamed
by many Russians for the country's economic misery and consistently
ranks as one of Russia's most unpopular figures. He continues as
head of Unified Energy Systems, the nation's electricity utility.

government policy. They were designed to ease the way for
Chernomyrdin's confirmation by the Duma, the lower house of
parliament, which has scheduled to open its debate on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov said talks were
stalled and the
</P>
<P>
   Kremlin offers were ``nothing more than an illusion.'' He
suggested that a vote on Chernomyrdin's confirmation may not take
place until Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   That would leave the country without a government for another
week, prolonging the political uncertainty as Russia's financial
system continues to unravel.
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts fear that a deadlock in negotiations will
only further weaken the ruble and increase the changes of social
unrest.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton is scheduled to hold a summit with Yeltsin in
Moscow on Tuesday and Wednesday, a meeting arranged before Russia's
crisis erupted this month.
</P>
<P>
   Emphasizing the new prominence of the Communists, the U.S.
ambassador to Russia, James Collins, met Friday with Zyuganov in
what may be a precursor to a meeting between the Communists and
Clinton when he visits Moscow next week.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after Yeltsin's videotaped remarks were aired, his chief
legislative adviser confirmed that Yeltsin _ a domineering
president known as ``Czar Boris''
</P>
<P>
   with sweeping powers under the 1993 constitution _ has offered
to grant Chernomyrdin the authority to name his own government and
to give parliament greater role in government appointments.
</P>
<P>
   To the dismay of Western economists, Chernomyrdin and the
Communist Party
</P>
<P>
   leaders in the parliament also agreed to Soviet-style controls
on the economy, erasing elements of free-market capitalism
introduced after the Soviet Union collapsed seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In another symbolic concession to the Communists, Yeltsin on
Friday fired prominent market reformers Anatoly Chubais and Boris
Nemtsov _ the latter
</P>
<P>
   had already resigned.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms being negotiated in an effort to ease the
financial crisis,
</P>
<P>
   the new government and parliament would implement price and
currency controls,
</P>
<P>
   nationalize some banks and companies and print more money
augment the nation's dwindling treasury.
</P>
<P>
   `The overriding goal is to stop the fall of the ruble, not to
allow the destruction of the economy and reduce the damage
sustained by every Russian,'' Chernomyrdin said.
</P>
<P>
   But repressive economic measures are likely to receive a cool
reception from
</P>
<P>
   the United States and other lenders.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said government controls on the economy and more rubles
in circulation
</P>
<P>
   may ease the current crisis for weeks or months, but risk
spawning massive
</P>
<P>
   inflation and social unrest.
</P>
<P>
   ``You will see empty shops and, down the line, starvation,''
predicted Al Breach of the of the Russian-European Center for
Economic Policy. ``This country is not self-sufficient. There is a
complete breakdown of economic order. The infrastructure is
completely rotten and the whole place is living on debt. And now it
is going cold turkey. The long winter will be the real test here.''
</P>
<P>
   The International Monetary Fund is scheduled to deliver a $4.3
billion installment of a $22.6 billion bailout package agree to
last month, however the aid is tied to assurances by the previous
Russian government under Sergei Kiriyenko that it would pursue
economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
   After months of mounting debt and falling financial markets,
Russia devalued the ruble on Aug. 17 and Yeltsin sacked the
Kiriyenko government on Sunday, replacing him with Chernomyrdin,
who had been fired in an earlier government overhaul in March.
</P>
<P>
   The turmoil sent the ruble into a free-fall this week,
plummeting as low as
</P>
<P>
   12.5 to the U.S. dollar from a previous rate of 6.2 to the
dollar two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Russians have mobbed banks seeking to withdrawal their savings
and headed to store to stock up on goods fearing shortages will
follow. Russia's largest jewelry distributor said sales increased
250 percent in the past two weeks as Russian sought to invest their
rubles in gold and silver before the ruble weakened further.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be naive to say that we'll take some steps and people
won't suffer,'' Yeltsin said in his televised remarks.
</P>
<P>
   ``However as president, I must say that we'll take every measure
to ensure that people don't lose their savings. I cannot promise
that prices won't go up, but as president I am obligated to do
everything to keep it to a minimum,'' he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Here are the leading figures in Russia's government,
parliament and business as the country struggles with the current
economic and political crisis:
</P>
<P>
   BORIS YELTSIN, 67, president
</P>
<P>
   Quote: ``I'm not going to resign. I will work as I'm supposed to
for my constitutional term. In 2000 there will be an election for a
new president and I will not run.''
</P>
<P>
   Background: Russia's first democratically elected president was
a political maverick in the old Communist Party. Yeltsin helped
hasten the end of the Soviet Union in 1991 and promised Russia the
rewards of democracy and free markets. Seven years later, the dream
has soured with economic and political chaos and an ailing Yeltsin
viewed as unable to cope with the crisis. While denying he will
resign, Yeltsin has agreed to cede powers to his prime minister and
parliament.
</P>
<P>
   VIKTOR CHERNOMYRDIN, 60, acting prime minister
</P>
<P>
   Quote: ``We must forget (political) ambitions, we must stabilize
the situation and ease tensions that have reached a critical
point.''
</P>
<P>
   Background: A Soviet-era bureaucrat, Chernomyrdin went on to
serve as Yeltsin's prime minister from December 1992 until March
this year, when he was fired for failing to fix the economy. Now
he's back and struggling to form a government and satisfy the
interests of the Communist opposition, Russia's powerful tycoons
and Western lenders urging Russia not to revive a Soviet-style
economy.
</P>
<P>
   GENNADY ZYUGANOV, 54, leader of the Communist Party
</P>
<P>
   Quote: ``We will only support a policy and a leadership that
will clearly and straightforwardly reject the so-called market
reforms and agree to take a different course.''
</P>
<P>
   Background: Leader of the opposition in the Duma, parliament's
lower house, Zyuganov was dismissed as politically impotent after
Yeltsin defeated him in the 1996 presidential race. But Zyuganov's
clout has risen considerably in the past week as he seeks a role
for his party in setting policy and filling key jobs in the new
government. Polls show he is the leading candidate to replace
Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   YEGOR STROYEV, 61, chairman of the Federation Council
</P>
<P>
   Quote: ``We should hurry to create a new government. Lack of any
authority at all is worse than the worst possible regime.''
</P>
<P>
   Background: The lackluster head of Russia's upper house of
parliament, Stroyev largely has served as a go-between for the
Kremlin and the Communist-dominated Duma. Opposition parties have
promoted him as an alternative candidate for prime minister. A
Soviet-era economist, he represents the interests of Russia's
provinces, whose governors sit on the federation council.
</P>
<P>
   YURI LUZHKOV, 62 mayor of Moscow and business tycoon
</P>
<P>
   Quote: ``If the Central Bank lacks either the money or the
desire to halt the crisis, the financial system will slowly crawl
towards destruction.''
</P>
<P>
   Background: The powerful mayor of Moscow -- who like
Chernomyrdin has aspirations to become president -- demonstrated
his status by his attendance in a meeting Friday with Yeltsin,
Chernomyrdin and Stroyev on the fate of Russia. A nationalist who
enjoys strong popularity in Moscow, Luzhkov has distanced himself
from the Kremlin during the current crisis. He could exploit the
current chaos to his political advantage should Chernomyrdin fail
to reverse the economic declines.
</P>
<P>
   ALEXANDER LEBED, 48, governor of the Krasnoyarsk region and a
presidential aspirant.
</P>
<P>
   Quote: ``Over the years, the population has grown poorer and
output has fallen, but the president and government told fairy
tales to Russians instead of taking the necessary steps.''
</P>
<P>
   Background: A tough-as-nails former army general with a popular
following in Russia (he finished third in the 1996 presidential
balloting), Lebed was courted by Chernomyrdin earlier this week in
what many analyst believed was an attempt to have him join the new
government. He likely wants to remain on the outside, though and,
like Luzhkov, attempt to exploit a failure of the new government in
time for the presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   BORIS BEREZOVSKY, 52, industrial and media baron; Yeltsin
advisor
</P>
<P>
   Quote: ``I am a product of privatization.''
</P>
<P>
   Background: A multibillionaire who helped finance Yeltsin's 1996
campaign and went on to become a Kremlin insider, Berezovsky has
emerged as the power behind the throne. Berezovsky is the most
prominent of the wealthy Russians known as the oligarchs, who made
their money buying and selling the assets of the dissolved Soviet
Union. He and others reportedly engineered Chernomyrdin's return to
protect the status quo, fearing economic reform amid the crisis
could dismantle their empires.
</P>
<P>
   ANATOLY CHUBAIS, 43, fired as Yeltsin's chief economic reformer
</P>
<P>
   Quote: ``Even given the present difficult financial situation,
there is no alternative to development of a market economy in
Russia or the country's integration into the world financial
system.''
</P>
<P>
   Background: Fired Friday as from his job as chief financial
liaison to the West, Chubais is an erudite reformer who since 1991
was the main architect of Russia's plan to privatize its Soviet-era
industries. He is the darling of Western economists, but is blamed
by many Russians for the country's economic misery and consistently
ranks as one of Russia's most unpopular figures. He continues as
head of Unified Energy Systems, the nation's electricity utility.

   RUSSIA-COMMUNISM-CZARS (Moscow) As some Russian leaders look
back to the Communist days in search of ways to pull the reeling
nation out of its tailspin, other Russians are looking back even
further _ to the days of the czars. While coping with its economic
and political crises, Russia also is enduring the latest of many
painful shakeups in place names, national symbols and recognized
heroes, part of the country's tradition of regularly reinventing
its past. Despite the country's poverty and financial turmoil, its
leaders continue to build grandiose monuments and reconstruct
symbols of days gone by, such as the Cathedral of Jesus Christ the
Savior, re-built at a cost of at least $300 million 60 years after
Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin had it blown up.

FLORIDA STATE QB QUALIFIES AS OLD FOLKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   By college football standards, Florida State quarterback Chris
Weinke qualifies as the sport's poster boy for the American
Association of Retired Persons.
</P>
<P>
   Make that ``former'' retired persons, in this case.
</P>
<P>
   Weinke, 26, spent seven seasons playing minor-league baseball in
the Toronto Blue Jays organization before deciding to take his
athletic career in another direction. That landed him at Florida
State, where a knee injury to projected starter Dan Kendra has
thrust Weinke into the starting lineup for Monday's matchup against
Texas A&AMP;M in the Kickoff Classic in East Rutherford, N.J. (7 p.m.,
WFAA/Channel 8).
</P>
<P>
   Weinke's last start at quarterback came nine years ago, when the
St. Paul, Minn., native led Cretin-Derham High School into the 1989
state playoffs. That same season, a rookie quarterback named Troy
Aikman made his debut with the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   Suffice to say, Florida State coach Bobby Bowden never expected
to hear from Weinke again after his prized signee informed him that
he would skip school and accept a $375,000 signing bonus from the
Blue Jays, who selected him in the second round of the 1990
major-league baseball draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had players in the same situation where I thought, `I'll
see this guy in a couple of years,' '' said Bowden, who vowed in
1990 to save a scholarship for Weinke if he ever changed his mind.
``But I thought Chris would make it. I never expected to have him
back.''
</P>
<P>
   Weinke decided to resurrect his football career in 1996 after
batting .186 in 51 games as a first baseman for the Blue Jays' AAA
affiliate in Syracuse, N.Y. Club officials wanted him to move to
catcher. Instead, Weinke moved to Tallahassee, Fla., and relishes
his chance to lead No. 2 Florida State against No. 14 Texas A&AMP;M in
the first national telecast of the college football season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't be happier with my decision. But it's hard to say
exactly what I'll be feeling on Monday night,'' said Weinke, a
sophomore who is older than 10 starting quarterbacks in the NFL.
``It'll be the first time I've started in nine years, so I know
I'll be excited ... and nervous. Anyone who says they're not
nervous in a game of this magnitude would be lying. I don't know
how I'll react.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither does Bowden, who watched Weinke (6-foot-5, 235 pounds)
complete seven of 13 passes for 82 yards in reserve duty last
season. Weinke ascended into the starter's role when Kendra
underwent reconstructive surgery after tearing the anterior
cruciate ligament in his right knee during the Seminoles' spring
game.
</P>
<P>
   During two-a-day practices, Bowden turned up the heat, freeing
first-team defenders to blitz at will in scrimmage situations.
Weinke withstood the pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not worried about him being under fire. He's been under
fire,'' Bowden said. ``He hasn't shown us anything where you'd
think he's not ready to play. I think he'll respond as good as you
could hope for a sophomore.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowden said his fondest wish is for Weinke to get ``a quick
taste of success'' against the Aggies to boost the confidence level
of a passer who has seen little game action since throwing for
3,956 yards and 24 touchdowns during 21 games as a high school
starter in 1988-89.
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;M coaches, who have little videotape of Weinke to study, are
unsure what to expect. On one hand, Weinke is untested at the
college level. He is coming off a long layoff from football and a
failed baseball career.
</P>
<P>
   But he is also mature, articulate and a millionaire, having
turned his signing bonus into a net worth in excess of $1 million
through investments over the past eight years. Because of his
maturity, Bowden said teammates have readily accepted Weinke as a
team leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you put him under pressure, a 26-year-old man is going to
react differently than your normal 18- or 19-year-old
quarterback,'' A&AMP;M coach R.C. Slocum said. ``But he's still new.
And any time you're doing something for the first time, there's
some apprehension involved. I really have no idea what to expect.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Johnson, the Aggies' defensive line coach, predicted Weinke
would not play his best game of the season against A&AMP;M because it
would ``take a little while ... to get the speed of the game
back.'' Toward that end, A&AMP;M likely will throw lots of blitzes and
stunts at Weinke early in the game to gauge his preparedness.
</P>
<P>
   Bring it on, Weinke said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not going to limit the offense because I'm at
quarterback, by any means,'' Weinke said. ``Obviously, it's the
first game. And there's always a few surprises in the first game. I
just feel comfortable with what I've studied and what I'm doing. I
consider this an opportunity for me to shine and that's something
I've been waiting for a long time.''
CHART Older than pros
</P>
<P>
   Florida State quarterback Chris Weinke, a 26-year-old sophomore
who spent seven seasons playing minor-league baseball before
enrolling in college, is older than 10 projected NFL starting
quarterbacks. The list: Quarterback Team AGE Tony Banks Rams 25
Kerry Collins Panthers 25 Bobby Hoying Eagles 25 Rob Johnson Bills
25 Steve McNair Oilers 25 Jake Plummer Cardinals 25 Kordell Stewart
Steelers 25 Danny Kanell Giants 24 Ryan Leaf Chargers 22 Peyton

CORNHUSKERS GO WITH VIRTUAL ROOKIE AT QB
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Inexperience at Nebraska typically involves an offensive lineman
who becomes a starter after three or four years of seasoning,
hundreds of practices and thousands of repetitions.
</P>
<P>
   Rarely do the Cornhuskers enter a season with a rookie at
quarterback, the hard drive of the team's option offense. But when
Nebraska begins defense of its co-national championship today
against Louisiana Tech, Bobby Newcombe will bring a sketchy resume
as he takes over as the team's quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure I'm going to be a little nervous,'' said Newcombe, a
6-foot, 195-pound sophomore. ``As an offense, every first game is a
challenge. We're basically going to play this like it's a bowl
game.''
</P>
<P>
   The on-field focus will be on Newcombe. The sideline focus will
be on Frank Solich, who makes his head coaching debut. For the
first time in 25 seasons, someone other than Tom Osborne will be
the Huskers' coach.
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska agreed to play in the Eddie Robinson Classic against
the Bulldogs (9-2 last season) because it wanted another game of
experience for its offense. Only three starters return from last
season's 13-0 team. The last time the Huskers were this green was
1996 and they lost their second game, at Arizona State.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Newcombe was the No. 3 quarterback behind starter
Scott Frost and backup Frankie London. Nebraska coaches decided
Newcombe's abilities were wasting away as a spectator. After two
games, he was switched to wingback. He appeared in 12 games last
season, compiling 589 all-purpose yards.
</P>
<P>
   Newcombe, who completed his only pass attempt last season for a
15-yard gain, won the job in spring practice, beating out London,
who has been switched to wingback.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an inexperienced quarterback, but he's a very mature
individual,'' Solich said. ``He has great athletic ability. He has
an excellent grasp of our offensive system. We think he can be
outstanding in our system. And he's done everything he can to
prepare himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Every day this summer, he stopped by the football office to
study film during breaks in his summer school classes. He's ahead
of schedule to obtain his degree in business management.
</P>
<P>
   Solich says that Newcombe is a threat every time he touches the
ball; considering the plan calls for him to take each snap, that
should make the Huskers offense dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   But Solich's hyperbole might be closer to the truth. In the Big
12 championship game against Texas A&AMP;M last December, Newcombe
caught a pass for 26 yards, gained 25 yards on a reverse and
returned a punt 40 yards. In Nebraska's spring game, he scored a
91-yard touchdown _ on the first play from scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   Newcombe, was born in Sierra Leone, Africa, and grew up in
Albuquerque, N.M., from the fourth grade on. In high school, he won
five gold medals in track and was a star basketball performer. His
4.46 speed in the 40-yard dash makes him the fastest Husker.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a much better thrower than people think he would be, but
we recruited him as a quarterback and he's a talented passer,''
Solich said. ``He's an excellent technician at running the option.
With his speed, he can turn any play into a big play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see him as a player able to handle the situation he's in. He
knows he needs to play well early.''
Nebraska at a glance 1997 record: 13-0, 8-0 in Big 12, won North
Division, Big 12 championship and co-national championship. Coach:
Frank Solich (first season). Stadium: Memorial (72,700). Returning
starters (offense): 3. Returning starters (defense): 7. All-star
candidates: K Kris Brown, DE Chad Kelsay, LB Jay Foreman. Key
newcomers: QB Bobby Newcombe, RT Jason Schwab, TB Correll
Buckhalter, TB Dan Alexander.

RIGHT NOW, BILL NEEDS HILLARY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, August 30, 1998)  
 (In 10th graf, corrects singer to Tammy Wynette.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's the end of the summer, the end of the bull market, and the
end of the honeymoon between Bill Clinton and the female voters who
up till now had mostly given him the benefit of the doubt.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not the end of his presidency, it is not the end of
his influence, and it need not be the end of his domestic
tranquility _ if Hillary Rodham Clinton hangs in there with him.
</P>
<P>
   The First Lady is a big part of the collateral damage caused by
the Monica missile. That not-so-smart-bomb came right down the
chimney of the Oval Office and, ignited by lust, bravado,
concupiscence or the kind of frat-house stupidity that is never
absent from the political gene pool, jolted America's faith in its
leader's concept of honor. What would Jackie O counsel Hillary?
</P>
<P>
   Bill bears the scarlet letter on his furrowed brow. Shame is the
rawest of emotions. Not only has one done something wrong, stupid
and base; but one is caught out, so the guilt is apparent to all,
and the blushing shines not only outward but inward, where it
constricts the gullet, sours the stomach, loosens the entrails,
taints the outlook on life. One shudders at the psychic cost.
</P>
<P>
   The public reaction was generally friendly and forgiving in
Worcester Thursday, it appeared. Ted Kennedy gave seatmate John
Kerry a lesson in how to stand by a fellow in a jam. Editorial
thunder scolds the voters for not being less forgiving. Anyone with
a keyboard puts the presidential marriage on the couch and
pontificates shamelessly. Hillary is upbraided for holding hands
with You-know-who. Every move is meticulously analyzed. A hundred
cameras on Martha's Vineyard are cocked for the slightest wrinkle
of petulance or frost.
</P>
<P>
   It's a rotten way to live, while trying to repair a
relationship, to raise a teenager. Being First Family can stagger
marriages; we've seen plenty evidence of that. Buddy the dog is the
only living thing in the White House whose opinion of Bill has not
changed. I am one who hopes Hillary forgives Bill, again, and tries
to move on.
</P>
<P>
   Not the least of Brother Bill's penance is the grief his
randiness showered on wife and daughter. Everyone's scarred by
proximity to this shoddy charade. Though it is not the end of the
world, its impact on his wife and daughter has to bother the hell
out of the president.
</P>
<P>
   Think ill of him as you may, his record is clear: he has never
been much of a villain, except in the eyes of political enemies
he's crossed. He does not have a track record as viictive,
punitive, mean-spirited, greedy. His indifference to money is
almost laughable in this age of I'll-get-mine-while-I-can. He is a
man of tolerance, inclusion, open-handeed-ness and
open-heartedness. Too open, too willing to feel your pain (and
perhaps more) if you're young and female and play up to his
blandishments.
</P>
<P>
   He may eventually stumble back into the good graces of enough
voters to survive, though the nation's editorial pages wax wroth,
and his many enemies in the media devote millions of harsh words
each day to denounce his fall from grace. That's politics. And
Bill, if he's shown nothing else, has shown he can handle the
politics with the best of them.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary has saved his sorry butt before. She burst on our
consciousness the night of the Super Bowl in '92, sitting on the
Ritz sofa in Boston, staring into the 60 Minutes camera, denying
she was lip-synching Tammy Wynetete's lyrics of ``Stand By Your
Man.'' That steely stare-down of the nation's curiosity about her
marriage saved Bill's bacon that night. Hillary could have croaked
him with one arched eyebrow, and chose not to.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton now admits having lied about not having an affair with
Gennifer Flowers. I didn't buy his denial then. You never know for
sure about these kinds of things. But after listening to Gennifer's
tape of Bill's phone calls, hearing Clinton repeat rubbish about
Mario Cuomo, it just sounded to me like Bill and Gennifer were
involved. Put that together with the other rumors, the innuendo,
the ``bimbo eruptions'' that rattled the campaign War Room, and it
was plain Bill had an eye for the ladies. If it was OK by Hillary,
it was OK by me.
</P>
<P>
   So all of his appointees, staff, and associates who now claim to
be betrayed are, in my view, incredibly naive. Where were you when
all those smoke signals were darkening the sky? I concluded early
on that Hillary and Bill had some sort of deal. I don't know the
details, and don't want to know. He was Lil' Abner on the political
make in Arkansas, she was the icily-ambitious Wellesley girl
plunked down in Dogpatch. Early on he showed signs of world-class
political talent. She made her bargain. Both of them wanted to
change the world, late-'60's style. Neither could do it without the
other.
</P>
<P>
   The late Jim McDougal's new book, ``Arkansas Mischief, The Birth
of a National Scandal,'' written by the Globe's Curtis Wilkie, is
the best explanation I've seen of the political culture Bill &AMP; Hill
grew up in. McDougal explains the $2,000 retainer his Madison bank
paid the Rose firm as a regularization _ okay, laundering _ of a
$2,000-a-month payoff that was being fed Clinton. McDougal, an
admitted perjurer, is dead, as are some other participants, so we
may never know for sure, but the tale fits the times.
</P>
<P>
   My impression, just off seven years of Clinton-watching, is that
Hillary was the one most eager to make money, in Whitewater, the
cattle futures, her law career. Why? Bill was a naif when it came
to money, a political wunderkind who was only making 30 grand a
year as a backcountry governor. When Chelsea was born, Hillary may
have wondered: who's going to pay for her to go to Wellseley, or
Stanford? Certainly not Bubba here. I'll have to do it, she
reasoned.
</P>
<P>
   So she thrashed around in the Whitewater underbrush, lost money
in the deal, got cross with McDougal, fought over the partnership,
and eventually got snared when a vengeful prosecutor, Kenneth
Starr, got hundreds of FBI agents and $45 million of tax money to
destroy her husband, and her. Like Inspector Javert of Les Miz, the
puritanical Starr pursued relentlessly. This right-wing Ahab
devoted four years to harpooning Bubba the White Whale.
</P>
<P>
   Don't forget Starr piously doubting the Clintons' ``spousal
integrity'' early on. The public pillorying both Clintons endure
has to be weighed against everything they've done, for women,
blacks, the powerless. Hillary fell short on health care, alas. But
her fingerprints are all over those appointments naming women as
secretary of state, attorney general, Supreme Court justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every professional woman I know in Wasngton is furious at
him,'' said a female White House correspondent of the Monica
confession. His sin is incontestable. But all those women who got
big government jobs count for something, and that wouldn't have
happened without Hillary's decision, made years ago, to stand by
her man, the one with those soulful lyin' eyes.

HOTTER 'N HELL FILLS TILLS BETTER THAN COWBOYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STACY FEDUCIA 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ Cycling is better than football.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, someone had the guts to say it, and Midwestern State
University has the evidence to back it up.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at the university recently completed a study on the
economic impact of having the Cowboys' training camp in Wichita
Falls, a city of about 100,000 in North Texas. Over the course of 4
1/2 weeks of football, fans contributed approximately $4.2 million
to the Wichita Falls economy.
</P>
<P>
   The Hotter 'N Hell Hundred, which rides today, will contribute
approximately $3.8 million to the local economy over the span of
``three days'', according to the Wichita Falls Convention and
Visitors Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Three days, $3.8 million. Four weeks, $4.2 million. Cycling
wins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Economic impact is a combination of retail sales _ staying in
hotels, going to restaurants, buying gasoline,'' explained George
Casper of the Convention and Visitors Bureau. ``When the Cowboys
were here, we had good occupancy and it was nice, but for this
race, every room is booked, all the restaurants are full. It's a
swarm of people.''
</P>
<P>
   The swarm commences with a mass start at 7:30 this morning on
Scott Street, with more than 8,600 expected to participate. The
United States Cycling Federation race begins at 7 a.m., with
nationally prominent teams such as defending champion Shaklee, EDS,
PowerBar and Mercury competing.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Hotter 'N Hell didn't quite live up to its name,
with overcast skies giving way to temperatures in the 80s and low
90s. Not so, this year, where temperatures in the mid-to-high 90s
are predicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The heat shouldn't slow the race down,'' said Bret Crosby of
the Wheels and Fitness in Motion/Cannondale team. ``It will take a
lot of riders out because of dehydration or cramping. In the past,
it's always been fast because it's flat.''
</P>
<P>
   It is also the largest sanctioned century ride and race in the
country _ which gives rise to the economic impact of the visitors
bureau _ and which is a draw for people from as many as 15 states.
</P>
<P>
   ``More people can participate in cycling rather than football,
which is a lot like voyeurism: You watch but you can't play,''
joked Jim Connally of Mid-Cities Wheelmen. ``All levels of people
can compete in this race.''
</P>
<P>
   And for all the unconvinced football fans _ the nonbelievers _
consider this: In cycling, there's no instant replay, no
commercials and no chance that they'll be riding with scissors.
Hotter 'N Hell Hundred What: Largest ride in the region with routes
of 10K, 25 miles, 50 miles, 100K or 100 miles.
</P>
<P>
   When: Today, 7:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Where: Scott Street, adjacent to Multi-Purpose Events Center, in
Wichita Falls.
</P>
<P>
   Registration: Today, starting at 5:30 a.m. at Multi-Purpose
Events Center Cost is $25.
</P>
<P>
   Defending champions: Eric Wohlberg, Team Shaklee in men's stage
race; Jennifer Evans, EDS in women's stage race. Wohlberg won the
100-mile road race last year, while EDS Linda Kruse won the women's
62.5-mile road race. The stage race consists of last night's
criterium, today's road race and tomorrow's time trial.

INSURORS AGREE TO CUT NONGROUP HEALTH INSURANCE PREMIUMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX PHAM  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Some consumers buying their own health insurance will
face significantly lower premiums compared to last year's rates,
thanks to some concerted arm twisting by state authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Half-a-dozen insurance companies this month agreed to lower
their nongroup insurance premiums by as much as 50 percent after
they were approached by officials from the Division of Insurance
State Rating Bureau and the Massachusetts Attorney General's
office. The rates were released Friday by the state.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen D'Amato, director of the rating bureau, said the state
wanted to make sure rates were more affordable. State law requires
carriers to sell health insurance to anyone wanting to buy it, but
companies can skirt the law by charging such high rates that no
consumer will buy their insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some carriers would have been priced (themselves) out of the
market had we not stepped in,'' D'Amato said.
</P>
<P>
   Tufts Health Plan, for example, lowered its premium 40 percent
for a 25-year-old single person living in Boston. United HealthCare
of New England Inc. cut its rate for the same person by 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Tufts said the original, higher rates
represented the company's best estimate of what it would cost for
Tufts to break even on the plan. ``This product is definitely not
an income-generator for us,'' said Michelle Davis of Tufts. ``But
we do have a commitment to being in the market, so we're willing to
take that risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Consumer groups were pleased with the results, but are still
worried that indemnity plans are unaffordable for many. ``We're
happy that the state has looked more carefully at the rates to make
sure that there is less disparity among the plans,'' said Rebecca
Derby of Health Care For All, a consumer group in Boston. ``We are
still concerned, however, with the high rates charged for indemnity
plans, especially in areas where less expensive HMOs are not as
available.''
</P>
<P>
   Consumers wanting to buy their own health insurance can sign up
during open enrollment period, which begins Sept. 1 and ends Nov.
30. For consumers who already purchase nongroup insurance, carriers
are in the process of notifying their members of the new rates.

DOW CLOSES DOWN ANOTHER 114 POINTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average attempted to stage a comeback
from Thursday's 357-point decline, but instead fell more than 100
points Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In a day notable for big swings in the index, and heavy trading
volume, the Dow Jones average of 30 blue-chip stocks closed at
8051.68, down 114.3 points, or 1.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The market's decline was led by the technology sector as
evidenced by the computer-dominated Nadsaq Composite Index, which
slumped 46.7 points, or 2.8 percent. Stocks such as Microsoft
Corp., which had withstood the market's slide better than most,
were hardest hit.
</P>
<P>
   But while a small decline Friday after Thursday's rout rattled
investors, it still did not shake their confidence in the US stock
market. Despite a market correction from its July highs, the Dow
Jones has gained 1.8 percent this year and the economy is still
growing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we'd seen another down 300-point day today I'd probably be
heading for the hills,'' said Tim Ghriskey, senior portfolio
manager for Dreyfus Corp. in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we're in the middle of what I call the beginning
of a major bear market. I see this as a correction'' that may end
soon, Ghriskey.
</P>
<P>
   But world markets Friday were down in a continuation of their
reaction to the collapse of Russia's currency markets and banking
system. Japan's Nikkei was first to react to Thursday's turmoil.
The 225-stock Nikkei hit its lowest level since March 1986,
plunging by 3.46 percent to close at 13,915.63 points.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow's retreat cut short a recovery on European markets in
midafternoon. The damage from the Dow was contained, however, and
European indexes saw continued but limited losses.
</P>
<P>
   Spain's IBEX index of 35 stocks, which has suffered from ties to
Latin America, fell another 2.3 percent. London's FT-SE 100-share
index finished with a loss of 2.2 percent. In Frankfurt, Germany's
DAX index fell by 1.7 percent, though officials said it might take
several hours to compute a final value after a hectic session. In
Paris, the CAC 40 index lost 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Global turmoil has forced a powerful lesson on investors who had
become bold in recent years about taking risks. ``There's been a
tendency (by investors) to focus on individual companies, on
Russia, on countries in Latin America,'' said Brian
Gendreau, &UR;  &LR; international economist for Salomon Smith Barney in New
York. ``But now it's pretty clear it's a global phenomenon.''
</P>
<P>
   The path of the Dow Jones index Friday was not straight down:
The index rose 78.53 points in early-morning trading and flirted
with 8,250 before tumbling to just above the benchmark 8,000 level
before noon _ the last time it crossed the 8,000 mark, on Feb. 2,
the market was on the way up.
</P>
<P>
   The afternoon brought a series of gains and losses that kept
market watchers close to their computer terminals.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow this week has lost a total of more than 600 points after
three straight days of losses, and the volatility is expected to
continue. Friday was the fourth busiest day ever on the New York
Stock Exchange; almost 840 million shares changed hands.
</P>
<P>
   A number of investment experts said that the US market's
correction may be nearing an end, though there are no guarantees
that it is over.
</P>
<P>
   ``There aren't a lot of silver linings,'' Scott Pape, a
portfolio manager for Loomis Sayles LP in Chicago, said Friday
after the market's close.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that Microsoft lost 4 a share and closed at 105 1/4,
while Cisco Systems Inc., a maker of telecommunications equipment,
lost 4 1/2 and closed 94 11/16.
</P>
<P>
   William Landes, chief investment officer for Putnam Investments,
a $265 billion investment company in Boston, said there is still
much to be optimistic about over the long-term.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economy is fine. Profits are reasonable ... and interest
rates are down to 5.35 percent,'' Landes said. ``There's nothing
that would lead you to believe this is a bear market.''
</P>
<P>
   The US banking sector was slammed again Friday as concerns
mounted about Russia-related losses and business ties to Asia.
BankAmerica Corp. fell 4 1/4 to 69 1/2 after revealing that it lost
$220 million from trading this quarter, mostly in Russia.
BankBoston, which fell 3 to 36, said it lost $30 million on
trading, one third of it from Russia.
</P>
<P>
   J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co., down 7 to 97 3/4, has lost a quarter of its
value since July 14.
</P>
<P>
   The bond market continued its rally as investors fled to
lower-risk markets. Yields on three-month Treasury bill yields fell
9 basis points to a 4.87 percent, the lowest since June 2, 1997.
The yield on 30-year Treasury bonds was little changed at 5.34
percent.

TIME FOR PATRIOTS RUNNING GAME TO BREAK OUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ If ever there was a time, a place, and an
opponent to instill a bit of confidence into the Patriots' running
game, Saturday night's final exhibition game against the
Philadelphia Eagles would be ideal.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots (2-2) have averaged 2.8 yards per carry against the
San Francisco 49ers, Minnesota Vikings, Dallas Cowboys, and
Washington Redskins, teams ranked second, 23rd, 24th, and 28th
against the rush last year in the NFL. The Eagles were 25th against
the run last season but in three exhibition games they have allowed
close to 150 yards on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   This week also marks the return of No. 1 pick Robert Edwards.
Edwards has gained 20 yards in six carries, all against the 49ers,
but has missed the last three games with a groin injury. He's
expected be used in relief of starter Sedrick Shaw. The Patriots
want Edwards to carry the ball at least a dozen times, but it might
be more if Edwards doesn't feel any pain from the groin injury.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is for one of the backs to break a long gainer, because
that's the only thing separating the Patriots from a decent running
attack. Derrick Cullors and Harold Shaw haven't posted a run of
longer than 16 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's just a matter of time before it happens,'' said
Drew Bledsoe. ``t's a matter of one of the backs breaking one
tackle sometimes after they hit the hole. Sometimes it's a matter
of luck and our backs haven't had any so far.''
</P>
<P>
   The running game hasn't been that bleak. On third down and less
than three yards, which is the ``tough yardage'' category, the
Patriots have converted first downs on seven of their nine
attempts. They've also converted two out of three attempts on
fourth down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're making progress,'' said left guard Max Lane. ``I
know some people just look at the average, but we're getting the
tough yardage when we need to get it. If it's third and one, we're
getting the yard. If it's fourth and one, we're getting the yard. I
think that's really developing well. We do need to spring some long
ones, but I think that will come.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots have had the toughest time running on first down,
averaging 2.7 yards per carry. They've been much better on second
down at 3.4 yards, and on third down, they've averaged 1.8 yards,
which is what brings down their overall average even though their
conversion rate is high.
</P>
<P>
   They've had 11 running plays which have netted negative yardage,
but one of them was an 8-yard loss by Troy Brown on a reverse.
</P>
<P>
   Sedrick Shaw leads the Patriots with 156 yards on 52 carries (a
3.0 average), while Harold Shaw has gained 131 yards on 51 carries
(2.6). The only back with an average above the desired 4.0 is
Derrick Cullors, who has 15 carries for 53 yards (4.1 yards).
</P>
<P>
   ``Robert needs to get the ball and run some,'' said coach Pete
Carroll. ``I'd like to keep him alive throughout a good portion of
the game and not overdo him too much at any one time. We want to
gauge that accordingly. I'd like to see him get the ball 10 times
or so and get a good dosage of our running plays and mix him into
the pass protection.''
</P>
<P>
   Edwards, considered a very smart player who picked up the
offense in no time during the mini-camps, fears only that his
conditioning might have lagged because of the weeks spent on the
bike.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can do all the bike work you want, but it's different than
being out on the field and playing in a game. The speed is much,
much greater and the conditioning could be a factor if I'm running
a few plays at a time. I might have to come out for a breather or
something.''
</P>
<P>
   While Edwards certainly wants to be somewhat cautious for fear
of reinjuring himself and spending more time on the sidelines, he
also wants to make an impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, I'd like to go out there and break a long run because it
seems that's what we're looking for right now,'' said Edwards. ``I
have to be smat about it. I can't risk getting hurt again and then
being out for a longer amount of time, but I want to contribute to
the team and help us win.''
</P>
<P>
   Edwards's first training camp is certainly shaping up much like
Terry Glenn's two years ago, when the Patriots had trouble getting
Glenn on the field early. Glenn missed the first two games of the
'96 season as a result of a hamstring pull but came on like
gangbusters to catch 90 passes, setting a rookie record.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards, who had never pulled a groin before, is being treated
cautiously by the trainign staff. But now Carroll and his staff
want to see more of what Edwards can do, though the consensus is
that Edwards could provide that breakaway threat that hasn't shown
up in the preseason thus far.
</P>
<P>
   It's also a huge game for Sedrick Shaw, who has gained some
tough yardage and has been able to get the ball into the end zone
inside the 5-yard line. With Edwards returning, the competition is
on again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've played as hard as I could every time out there,'' said
Shaw. ``I'm trying to improve every time out in everything the
coaches want me to get better at. I really have no control over
what they're going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Harold Shaw has shown he hits the hole hard but not much beyond
that. His next step is to show a little more speed and burst once
he gets through the hole.
</P>
<P>
   Other points of interest in the exhibtion finale:
</P>
<P>
   _Bledsoe's goal is to hit the long ball to either Terry Glenn or
Shawn Jefferson. He's missed both wide open during the first four
games.
</P>
<P>
   _While most of the jobs are settled in Carroll and Bobby Grier's
mind, there's still some sorting out to do on the defensive line,
where Mike Jones, Leonta Rheams, Devin Wyman, and Brandon Mitchell
appear to be competing for two spots.
</P>
<P>
   _With Chris Slade sitting out another game, Vernon Crawford and
Bernard Russ will get a significant amount of playing time to sort
out their futures. Crawford has appeared to make it, but Russ may
be fighting for his roster spot.
</P>
<P>
   _The cornerback spot also needs sorting. Veteran Steve Israel is
reportedly running again and may be on his way to recovery from his
knee surgery in the off-season. Along with Tebucky Jones, the
Patriots also have Steve Lofton and Kato Serwanga, and they may be
fighting for one spot.
</P>
<P>
   _The Patriots like to hold onto their draft picks. Of the 19
they've taken the past two years, only Tony Gaiter has been cut
(twice). Gaiter was re-signed to the practice squad last year. They
have tough decisions to make not only on Rheams, a fourth-rounder,
but center Jason Andersen, a seventh-rounder from Brigham Young.

STROBLE SWINGS TO EARLY SENIOR CLASSIC LEAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PAUL HARBER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, Mass. _ Bobby Stroble, the man of a thousand swings,
needed only 64 of them Friday to take the first-round lead of the
$1 million BankBoston Senior Classic at Nashawtuc CC.
</P>
<P>
   Stroble fashioned his 8-under-par total by hitting only 12
greens and escaping bogey six times.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Connor, one of only two men to play in both the golf and
tennis US Opens, is one stroke behind. George Archer is two behind
Stroble, while the gang of Joe Inman, Ed Dougherty, Gibby Gilbert,
Al Geiberger, Dale Douglass, and Walter Hall are at 5-under.
</P>
<P>
   Stroble, 55, says he isn't fazed by the money or the legends of
the PGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up hard in hard times, and nothing bothers me after
that,'' said Stroble, who honed his skills playing against the
likes of the legendary Teddy Rhodes on the United Golf Association,
a tour in which the money wagered between the golfers was usually
bigger than the tournament purse. ``You had to know what you were
doing on that tour,'' said Stroble. ``There were a lot of games
being played.''
</P>
<P>
   The UGA was the all-black tour that flourished when the PGA's
by-laws contained a Caucasians-only clause.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, I think there is prejudice today,'' said Strobel.
``Yeah, I think everybody is a little prejudiced but that's OK as
long as we give each other a little space.''
</P>
<P>
   Stroble has found success in Massachusetts. He shot a
final-round 65 to finish in the top five of this tournament two
years ago. As an itinerant pro preparing for the Senior Tour 10
years ago, he won the Boston Open at Franklin Park, fashioning a
course-record 64. And in the halcyon UGA days, he shot a
course-record 66 at Braintree Municipal some 25 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a whole bunch of course records,'' said Stroble, whose
proudest accomplishment is a 25 over nine holes in a UGA tournament
at Knoxville, Tenn. ``I don't think anybody will do that.''
</P>
<P>
   He had a round of 58 that day.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's 64 ties the course record first set by Bruce Crampton
in 1986 and tied by Dale Douglas (1988 and '89), Chi Chi Rodriguez
(1990 and '93), Kermit Zarley (1993), and Tommy Aaron (1995).
</P>
<P>
   Stroble hit only 11 fairways and 12 greens Friday and took just
22 putts. ``These are great greens,'' said Stroble. ``But they
seems a lot slower today that they were earlier in the week. But
that didn't matter. I made a ton of putts today.''
</P>
<P>
   Stroble went with a new, shorter putter this week but isn't sure
of its make.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know. It's Rick Massengale's. Made by the English
guy,'' offered Stroble, who made four birdies on the front and four
more on the back nine. He started out by sinking a 5-footer on the
opening hole, then knocked in a 20-footer on No. 3. After dropping
a 6-footer on No. 6, he drilled a 12-footer on the seventh hole.
</P>
<P>
   On the back nine, Stroble tapped in a 3-footer on No. 11, canned
an 8-footer on No. 12 and a 10-footer on No. 14. The putt that put
him in sole possession of first place was a 25-footer on the
finishing hole.
</P>
<P>
   Connor, who along with Ellsworth Vines are the only men to
compete in the US Open in both tennis and golf, had a 31 on the
front nine on the way to his 65. Connor also is celebrating his
30th wedding anniversary this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   What did he get for his wife, who is home teaching third grade
in San Antonio, Texas? ``Nothing. When you make as much money as we
do, they go out and buy their own presents,'' said Connor, who has
won $320,653 in 25 events this year. He figures he needs to win
another $140,000 to finish in the top 31 and earn a berth in the
Tour Championship.
</P>
<P>
   George Archer is thinking more about retiring than winning
tournaments. Since having his hip replaced in 1996 _ his seventh
major surgery since turning professional _ the 59-year-old has been
in pain. However, he won the First of America Classic Aug. 16.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not fun for me to be out here by myself,'' said Archer.
``I've been giving a lot of thought to retirement. Then I won the
tournament at Grand Rapids. I think I'll play until June of next
year and then take July and August off and go fishing. I'll be 60
soon after that (Oct. 1, 1999), and then I might just play the
Super Seniors.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton has fallen into a character
chasm, the first modern president to be rated far higher by the
public for his performance in office than for personal virtues like
honesty and integrity.

   Pollsters are intrigued by surveys taken since the president's
confessions last week that he had an extramarital affair with
former White House intern Monica S. Lewinsky and misled the public.
They never have seen such a disparity in public attitudes between
presidential duty and character, they say, nor as dramatic a
reversal in how Americans typically view their presidents _ as weak
leaders but likable men.
</P>
<P>
   The polls also suggest the public may be much more unsettled
about Clinton and his capacity to lead than his soaring
job-approval rating indicates.
</P>
<P>
   With trust in the president at an all-time low, a report from
independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr that would focus on perjury or
expose the seamy details of a sexual relationship could anger
Americans and still turn them against the president, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I see here is not so much about sex _ people say they
have had enough embarrassing and uncomfortable discussions about
that _ but a growing concern about whether the president was
truthful in his admissions and sincere in his apology,'' said John
Zogby, an independent pollster.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, the president took a step in that direction, telling a
church audience on Martha's Vineyard that he was ``having to become
quite an expert at this business of asking for forgiveness, and it
gets a little easier the more you do it.'' In what appeared to be a
reference to Starr, Clinton said he realized he had to forgive
those who wronged him in order to be forgiven himself.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials have suggested that the president's high
job-performance rating _ between 60 and 70 percent in most recent
polls _ shows the public is unfazed by the Lewinsky scandal and
wants the president to get beyond the sordid story and back to the
nation's work.
</P>
<P>
   Zogby's most recent poll, taken for several New York newspapers
after Clinton's speech to the nation last week, put the president's
job-approval rating at 57 percent. That was slightly lower than the
62 percent reported in a USA Today/CNN poll conducted over the
weekend. Clinton's approval rating in the Washington Post/ABC News
poll late last week was 66 percent, as high as it has ever been.
</P>
<P>
   But the character questions told a different story. In the USA
Today poll, fewer than one-third of those surveyed said the words
``honest and trustworthy'' applied to Clinton. The results of the
Washington Post survey were worse for the president: Only 19
percent of respondents said he ``had personal, moral, and ethical
standards.''
</P>
<P>
   Americans aren't ignoring the president's personal behavior, and
they are quite judgmental about it. According to a poll released
Thursday by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press,
62 percent of those surveyed say they don't like Clinton
personally, 70 percent say his relationship with Lewinsky was
``very wrong,'' and the one word people volunteered most to
describe the president was ``liar.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Senator Nancy Kassebaum Baker, a Kansas Republican,
called on the Clinton this week to resign and questioned whether he
had the character to acknowledge he had acted irresponsibly and
``tarnished'' the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``For President Clinton, there is no sense of personal
responsibility for the action he's taken,'' Kassebaum Baker said on
Tuesday in an interview with the Wichita Eagle. ``That's why I'd
like him to stand up and say, `It does matter, it does count, I
recognize that, and I have let the public down.' But that doesn't
happen very much these days.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there isn't much public sentiment for the president's
resignation. In the Pew poll, 75 of respondents said Clinton should
stay in office. In the Zogby poll, 62.6 percent said the president
should consider resigning if he lied in his testimony to the Starr
grand jury on Aug. 17. The USA Today poll found 67 percent of the
public against impeaching the president over the Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people's ability to separate Clinton, the man, from
Clinton, the chief executive, is very clear,'' said Andrew Kohut,
director of the Pew Research Center. ``They have a very poor
impression of him as a person, but they like his basic job of
running the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Americans generally give the president credit for a strong
economy and a successful foreign policy, and they want the country
to stay on course.
</P>
<P>
   ``The White House has clung to these job-performance ratings
like a life raft,'' said Alan Secrest, a pollster for Democratic
candidates. ``The mounting tension for Americans is whether they
want to view the president as an effective city councilman or
glorified ombudsman, or as a father figure in terms of imparting
morals and values.''
</P>
<P>
   For Democrat politicians, the most immediate concern is the
midterm congressional elections. There are growing fears that
Democrats disenchanted with Clinton won't turn out for party
candidates on Nov. 3, that the election agenda won't center on
Democratic issues such as health care and Social Security, and that
a ruckus over the Starr report in Washington could delay lawmakers
up for reelection from getting home to their districts.
</P>
<P>
   But the larger question is whether Clinton commands the respect,
has the time, or wields the moral authority to lead effectively.
House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt's criticism this week of the
president's conduct and credibility gave other Democrats the green
light to distance themselves from a vulnerable president.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Pew poll, 55 percent of the public believes the
scandal is interfering with the president's ability to govern, and
43 percent think Clinton does not command sufficient respect from
other leaders to be effective.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of Clinton's great weaknesses as a public official is that
he has always wanted to please people too much,'' said former
Senator Paul Simon, an Illinois Democrat who now directs the Public
Policy Center at Southern Illinois University. Simon predicted it
will be even harder for Clinton to pitch anything but ``political
softballs'' in the rest of his term. ``Character matters in
leadership. We are going to see a diminished presidency,'' he said.

   ATTN: Mon, Aug. 31, is the one-year anniversary of the tragic
death of Britain's former Princess Diana. Cox European
correspondent Bert Roughton Jr., in the following package, takes a

</P>
<P>
   DIANA-ANNIVERSARY _ LONDON _ A year after her tragic death in an
automobile accident in Paris, Princess Diana remains ``the people's
princess.'' She has come to represent an ideal of ordinary decency
to average English people, who consider her an icon they can relate
to. What's more, she has become an international symbol for people
around the world of charity, and class. A year later, it appears
her presence is a strong as ever as stories about her are in the
news weekly, and millions of dollars is given (and taken) in her
name daily. (Roughton, Cox News Service).

British populace to ascend to the throne when his grandmother,
Queen Elizabeth passes away -- ahead of his well-known father,
Prince Charles, and uncle, Prince Andrew. (Roughton, Cox News
Service).

   DIANA-INVESTIGATION _ LONDON _ The automobile accident that
caused Princess Di's death has spawned numerous investigations, and

   DIANA _ Monday is the first anniversary of Princess Diana's
birthday in eternity. That's a pious phrase long used by Christian
faithful to describe the day a saint died. For millions of her
fans, Diana, the rincess of Wales, remains a kind of secular
saint. She personifies, for them, all that is good and gracious in
a world of struggle and pain. To be sure, Diana struggled much,
knew great pain and was, in many ways, a good and gracious person.
But she is not likely to be a saint. The remarkable relationship
between the troubled princess and her adoring public is more
complicated. (Gushee, Palm Beach Post). 21.

   GLENN _ John Glenn's historic return to space is now just two
months away but knowlegeable observers remain unimpressed with the
science of the flight, even as they pledge support for it on
thematic grounds. But that's what NASA had in mind anyway. NASA
Administrator Dan Goldin spoke frankly in an interview with us
earlier this summer about how he insisted the science be
legitimate, but how he never intended for it to be the sole
justification for Glenn's return to space. ``I wasn't asking the
National Institutes of Health to say, 'I want you to fly John
Glenn.' But I said, 'Given that John Glenn is flying I want you to
tell me that he's doing good science.''' (Montgomery, Dayton Daily

   FLU-RISK _ Eighty years ago, the Spanish Flu virus killed 40
million people and then disappeared. Scientists trying to pry its
secrets out of an Arctic cemetery are taking no chances that they
might bring it back to life. The four-nation team believes that
frozen remnants of the virus are in the bodies of seven victims
that were buried in permafrost in the island outpost of
Longyearbyen, north of the Norwegian mainland. The chance that the
1918 virus hidden in the bodies remains infectious is ``very small
- but it is not zero,'' according to Peter Lewin, a pediatrician
who was asked to join the team becuase of his hobby: medical
archaeology, which included recovering smallpox virus fragments
from an Egyptian mummy. The team hopes for the best but is assuming
the worst: Pathologists will wear protective gear compatible with
arctic clothing, and the tent around the excavation will be the
portable equivalent of the most secure lab at CDC. (McKenna,

   JAMAICA-BROTHELS _ KINGSTON, JAMAICA _ A fervent call has come
in Jamaica to legalize brothels by none other than ... the
president of the Chamber of Commerce? ``We could be like
Amsterdam,'' said Howard Hamilton. Tourism provides jobs for more
than 40 percent of the island's population. But tourists aren't
flocking to Jamaica like they once did because of harassment, the
worst in the Caribbean. In the midst of an economic depression,
tourists find themselves bombarded by desperate panhandlers,
prostitutes, drug dealers and craft vendors, so much so that
Holland America and Celebrity Cruise Lines pulled out of Jamaica
last year. Jamaica has increased fines for those who badger
tourists, from $27 to $2,700. But still the harassment continues.
Hamilton said that if the country legalized brothels, at least the
prostitutes would stay off the streets -- he hopes. (Emling, Cox

   BELARUS-PUPPET _ MINSK, Belarus _ The Soviet Union has collapsed
and the Moscow nights swing nowadays, but back here in Minsk old
communist-style think still remains the norm. Take the case of
``Pinocchio.'' The Belarussian version of the traditional puppet
show for children was yanked off the Minsk stage not long ago when
critics saw too many allusions to the current nasty political scene
in the play. How could a mere children's show cause so much offense
in this dictator-run land? That's easy. To begin with, Ales Surau,
the set designer, dressed the wooden ``actors'' in contemporary
quilted jackets, Russian workers' caps, and workers' rubber boots.
That act alone aroused the ire of the official critics. ``The
peasants look like criminals. I was at a collective farm not long
ago and I saw people there who were very well dressed,'' one them
complained. (Golinski, Cox News Service).

   MEXICO-DEAFMUTE _ MEXICO CITY _ He sold trinkets in the New York
subway, Chicago and the suburban American South. But by the time he
was discovered by U.S. authorities, life had changed for Braulio
David Infante. He knew that deaf people in the United States had
high schools, colleges and could develop professions. He was smart
and ambitious why couldn't he? Infante, who just turned 20, was
among the many undocumented Mexican deaf mutes discovered in the
United States last year, some held in virtual captivity and forced
to turn over trinket profits to ring leaders. Infante was sent back
from Atlanta to Mexico, where authorities promised to help him and
others with new opportunities to overcome barriers in Mexico.
Almost a year later, he says, nothing has changed. The Mexican
government recently made similar promises to deaf mutes who
returned from New York in July. But Infante says social workers
here have treated him as if he were mentally retarded. Clever and
resourceful, he longs to break out of the silence that isolates
him. He wants to attend college and become a Mexican-American Sign
Language interpreter. But in Mexico there isn't even a high school
for him to attend. Infante remains in contact with his Atlanta
lawyer, and dreams of one day attending school in the United
States. (Ferriss, Cox News Service).

<P>
   DIANA-ANNIVERSARY _ LONDON _ A year after her tragic death in an
automobile accident in Paris, Princess Diana remains ``the people's
princess.'' She has come to represent an ideal of ordinary decency
to average English people, who consider her an icon they can relate
to. What's more, she has become an international symbol for people
around the world of charity, and class. A year later, it appears
her presence is a strong as ever as stories about her are in the
news weekly, and millions of dollars is given (and taken) in her
name daily. (Roughton, Cox News Service).

mother's features, he may actually be the first choice among the
British populace to ascend to the throne when his grandmother,
Queen Elizabeth passes away -- ahead of his well-known father,
Prince Charles, and uncle, Prince Andrew. (Roughton, Cox News
Service).
</P>
<P>
   DIANA-INVESTIGATION _ LONDON _ The automobile accident that
caused Princess Di's death has spawned numerous investigations, and
her death itself numerous lawsuits in different countries. Where we
are with these investigations and lawsuits? (Roughton, Cox News

   DIANA-MEMORIAL _ PARIS _ Parisians and tourists have been
invited to join a candle-lit procession to the Pont de lAlma to
commemorate the first anniversary of the death of Diana, Princess
of Wales. A ceremony will be held at 12:26 a.m. (local time) today,
to mark the moment when Dianas limousine hit the 13th pillar of an
underpass on a right bank expressway. Her companion, Dodi Fayed,
and the driver, Henri Paul, also died. The ceremony is being
organized by a private association, Paris Odysee, after the royal
family informed the British embassy and Paris city council that
expressions of grief should be limited to personal reflection.

   DIANA _ Monday is the first anniversary of Princess Diana's
birthday in eternity. That's a pious phrase long used by Christian
faithful to describe the day a saint died. For millions of her
fans, Diana, the Princess of Wales, remains a kind of secular
saint. She personifies, for them, all that is good and gracious in
a world of struggle and pain. To be sure, Diana struggled much,
knew great pain and was, in many ways, a good and gracious person.
But she is not likely to be a saint. The remarkable relationship
between the troubled princess and her adoring public is more
complicated. (Gushee, Palm Beach Post). 21.

   GLENN _ John Glenn's historic return to space is now just two
months away but knowlegeable observers remain unimpressed with the
science of the flight, even as they pledge support for it on
thematic grounds. But that's what NASA had in mind anyway. NASA
Administrator Dan Goldin spoke frankly in an interview with us
earlier this summer about how he insisted the science be
legitimate, but how he never intended for it to be the sole
justification for Glenn's return to space. ``I wasn't asking the
National Institutes of Health to say, 'I want you to fly John
Glenn.' But I said, 'Given that John Glenn is flying I want you to
tell me that he's doing good science.''' (Montgomery, Dayton Daily

   FLU-RISK _ Eighty years ago, the Spanish Flu virus killed 40
million people and then disappeared. Scientists trying to pry its
secrets out of an Arctic cemetery are taking no chances that they
might bring it back to life. The four-nation team believes that
frozen remnants of the virus are in the bodies of seven victims
that were buried in permafrost in the island outpost of
Longyearbyen, north of the Norwegian mainland. The chance that the
1918 virus hidden in the bodies remains infectious is ``very small
- but it is not zero,'' according to Peter Lewin, a pediatrician
who was asked to join the team becuase of his hobby: medical
archaeology, which included recovering smallpox virus fragments
from an Egyptian mummy. The team hopes for the best but is assuming
the worst: Pathologists will wear protective gear compatible with
arctic clothing, and the tent around the excavation will be the
portable equivalent of the most secure lab at CDC. (McKenna,

Amsterdam,'' said Howard Hamilton. Tourism provides jobs for more
than 40 percent of the island's population. But tourists aren't
flocking to Jamaica like they once did because of harassment, the
worst in the Caribbean. In the midst of an economic depression,
tourists find themselves bombarded by desperate panhandlers,
prostitutes, drug dealers and craft vendors, so much so that
Holland America and Celebrity Cruise Lines pulled out of Jamaica
last year. Jamaica has increased fines for those who badger
tourists, from $27 to $2,700. But still the harassment continues.
Hamilton said that if the country legalized brothels, at least the
prostitutes would stay off the streets -- he hopes. (Emling, Cox

   BELARUS-PUPPET _ MINSK, Belarus _ The Soviet Union has collapsed
and the Moscow nights swing nowadays, but back here in Minsk old
communist-style think still remains the norm. Take the case of
``Pinocchio.'' The Belarussian version of the traditional puppet
show for children was yanked off the Minsk stage not long ago when
critics saw too many allusions to the current nasty political scene
in the play. How could a mere children's show cause so much offense
in this dictator-run land? That's easy. To begin with, Ales Surau,
the set designer, dressed the wooden ``actors'' in contemporary
quilted jackets, Russian workers' caps, and workers' rubber boots.
That act alone aroused the ire of the official critics. ``The
peasants look like criminals. I was at a collective farm not long
ago and I saw people there who were very well dressed,'' one them
complained. (Golinski, Cox News Service).

   MEXICO-DEAFMUTE _ MEXICO CITY _ He sold trinkets in the New York
subway, Chicago and the suburban American South. But by the time he
was discovered by U.S. authorities, life had changed for Braulio
David Infante. He knew that deaf people in the United States had
high schools, colleges and could develop professions. He was smart
and ambitious why couldn't he? Infante, who just turned 20, was
among the many undocumented Mexican deaf mutes discovered in the
United States last year, some held in virtual captivity and forced
to turn over trinket profits to ring leaders. Infante was sent back
from Atlanta to Mexico, where authorities promised to help him and
others with new opportunities to overcome barriers in Mexico.
Almost a year later, he says, nothing has changed. The Mexican
government recently made similar promises to deaf mutes who
returned from New York in July. But Infante says social workers
here have treated him as if he were mentally retarded. Clever and
resourceful, he longs to break out of the silence that isolates
him. He wants to attend college and become a Mexican-American Sign
Language interpreter. But in Mexico there isn't even a high school
for him to attend. Infante remains in contact with his Atlanta
lawyer, and dreams of one day attending school in the United
States. (Ferriss, Cox News Service).

FEDERAL REPORT QUESTIONS CRANE'S MONOPOLY ON CURRENCY PAPER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Crane &AMP; Co. of Dalton, Mass., the sole supplier of
US currency paper, should face competition that might lower the
government's cost of printing money, according to a report issued
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government is unable to say whether it has obtained
a ``fair and reasonable price'' for its currency paper, said the
General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   While the GAO's conclusion has been long expected, Massachusetts
lawmakers said they had succeeded in ensuring that some of the
wording was watered down from a draft report circulated in July.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Edward M. Kennedy, for example, had complained that the
draft report improperly suggested that subsidies be given to
Crane's competitors. That suggestion was deleted from the final
report.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a positive report for Crane, and a much fairer report
than the initial GAO report,'' Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the report's main conclusion _ that Crane should face
competition _ remains the key recommendation. The GAO said the
Bureau of Engraving and Printing couldn't determine whether it had
paid fair prices for the paper supplied by Crane, which has been
the primary supplier of US currency paper since 1879,
</P>
<P>
   ``BEP sometimes accepted prices even though it was unable to
determine that they were fair and reasonable because it had no
other source for currency paper,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Lester Crane, the chairman of the Crane company, said it was
unfair for the GAO to leave any impression that the government had
wasted money in buying paper only from Crane. He said that his
company's cost efficiencies provide a fair price for the
government. Crane said it was unfair to describe his company as
having a monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   Crane said that other companies have had the right to bid for
the four-year, $400 million contract. He said the report issued
Friday is moot because the government last January took bids from
several companies, including Crane, for the new contract. The
government is scheduled to announce the winning bidder _ or
bidders, if the contract is broken up _ sometime this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing wrong here that needs to be fixed,'' Crane
said. ``The solicitation process is open.''
</P>
<P>
   As many as 250 out of 1,350 employees at Crane are directly
involved in producing US currency paper. The company also
manufactures currency papers for other countries, including China,
and makes other paper products.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO report was requested by Representative Jim Koble, an
Arizona Republican. Kolbe, whose district includes copper mines,
has sponsored legislation calling for the widespread production of
a dollar coin, which might include copper. If a silver dollar is
manufactured and becomes popular, that could pose another challenge
for Crane. About 45 percent of the currency paper produced by Crane
for the United States is for dollar bills.
</P>
<P>
   But Kolbe press secretary Ron Foreman said the congressman's
interest in Crane has nothing to do with the proposal for a dollar
coin.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is a canard that Crane has been throwing around for some
time,'' Foreman said. ``The American taxpayer is paying too much
for the paper our money is printed on.''
</P>
<P>
   Foreman said that Kennedy and others in the Massachusetts
congressional delegation pressured the GAO to weaken the report,
which Foreman said might result in Crane's continued dominance. The
GAO report must be reviewed by Congress before the government
announces whether Crane will continue to have sole control of the
contract, Foreman said.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Felix, a spokesman for the Bureau of Engraving and
Printing, said the government is ``happy with the relationsihp with
Crane &AMP; Co.'' The bureau ``has found that in most instances, the
price has been fair. In those instances we felt they weren't fair,
we went to an arbitrator. The arbitrator gave us some things and
gave Crane some things, as in most arbitrations.''

PROSECUTOR CHALLENGES MOBSTER'S CLIAM OF FBI PROTECTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATRICIA NEALON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ If, as gangster/informant Stephen Flemmi claims, a
former FBI supervisor warned him and his fugitive criminal partner
James ``Whitey'' Bulger that they were about to be indicted, a
federal prosecutor asked Friday, why did Flemmi stick around?
</P>
<P>
   Grilling Flemmi on the witness stand, Assistant US Attorney Fred
M. Wyshak Jr. demanded to know why wasn't Flemmi on the lam now,
like Bulger, his longtime friend, who has eluded the law for more
than 3 1/2 years?
</P>
<P>
   ``I had mixed feelings about it,'' Flemmi testified, in his
seventh and final day on the witness stand in federal court. ``I
could have very well left.''
</P>
<P>
   Wyshak argued that the fact that he remained and was arrested at
gunpoint outside a downtown restaurant on the night of Jan. 5,
1995, casts doubt on one of Flemmi's claims: that former FBI
organized crime supervisor John M. Morris alerted Flemmi and Bulger
to the indictment a week before it was returned.Friday
</P>
<P>
   Yet even as he challenged Flemmi's claim that Morris had tipped
him off, Wyshak suggested that the sort of ``headstart'' that
Flemmi claims to have gotten from Morris was the sum total of the
deal he had cut with his bureau handlers _ not the blanket,
immunity-for-life for any crime short of murder, which Flemmi says
he has.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what Mr. Bulger got, a headstart?'' Wyshak asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what Mr. Bulger got was a telephone call telling him
the indictment was coming down, the same as I got,'' said Flemmi.
He said Bulger called him with the news after getting a call from
Morris, who he and Bulger had nicknamed ``Vino'' because of his
fondness for fine wine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very brief conversation,'' Flemmi said of his phone
call from Bulger. ``He just told me that the indictments were
coming down. I said, `Goodbye and good luck.'''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators now know that Bulger and his longtime companion,
Teresa Stanley, were on vacation in San Francisco and New Orleans
in the weeks before his indictment.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last spring, Stanley told the Globe that she and
Bulger were driving home to Boston when they heard on the car radio
that Flemmi had been arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Bulger seemed surprised by the news and stopped at a hotel
somewhere in Connecticut or western Massachusetts for the night,
according to Stanley.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Bulger dropped Stanley off at a Hingham
restaurant, where a relative retrieved her.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators say Bulger then picked up Catherine Greig, a woman
he had secretly been having a relationship with for 20 years. Since
then, Bulger and Greig have been spotted in New York, Louisiana,
Mississippi, and Wyoming. Last year, the FBI announced a $250,000
reward for Bulger's capture and charged Greig with harboring a
fugitive.
</P>
<P>
   Wyshak suggested Friday that Flemmi knew independently that the
indictments were coming and squirreled money away in offshore
accounts. Flemmi refused to talk about that.
</P>
<P>
   Morris admitted in April that he took $7,000 from Bulger and
Flemmi and alerted Flemmi to a wiretap so he wouldn't be recorded.
But Morris denied alerting Bulger and Flemmi to the January 1995
indictment.
</P>
<P>
   At the time Flemmi says Bulger got the call from Morris, Morris
was working at the FBI's training academy in Quantico, Va., and had
been out of the bureau's Boston office for several years. He
retired in December 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Morris testified under a grant of immunity, which means that he
could only face criminal charges if it is shown that he lied during
his testimony in April.
</P>
<P>
   Morris also testified that he was the one who had confirmed
Bulger's status as an informant to the Globe in 1988, hoping that
the revelation would lead to the gangster's prosecution instead of
his protection.
</P>
<P>
   Flemmi is trying to convince US District Judge Mark L. Wolf that
racketeering, extortion, and murder charges against him should be
dropped because he was promised immunity from prosecution in
exchange for information he gave the FBI on the Mafia.
</P>
<P>
   After nearly five months of testimony by defense witnesses, the
government is slated to begin its case next week when it calls the
first of 15 witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Flemmi said that he and Bulger held up their end of the
bargain but the FBI did not.
</P>
<P>
   La Cosa Nostra ``was taken down,'' Flemmi said. ``That was their
main concern. We fulfilled our bargain. ... We did a hell of a
job.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if informing on his criminal rivals _ including onetime
close friend and Mafia boss Francis P. Salemme _ had also made him
a wealthy man, Flemmi invoked his Fifth Amendment right against
self-incrimination.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Besides the 1995 criminal charges he is contesting before
Wolf, Flemmi was charged in a separate indictment last year with
laundering criminal profits through the purchase of real estate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We formed a partnership, the FBI and I. ... Yes, we did all
right,'' he said.

 &HT;    Allman fans trash grave site
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MACON, Ga._ City workers Friday tore down and hauled away the
8-foot-tall, chain link-and-razor wire fence that the sister of
Allman Brothers Band member Berry Oakley erected around the graves
of her brother and band co-founder Duane Allman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in shock,'' said Candace Oakley. ``I'm having trouble even
thinking straight.''
</P>
<P>
   The graves are a magnet for fans of the band, and Oakley had the
fence put up about a month ago. Many fans were trashing the site,
she said, and three months ago someone tried to dig up the remains.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is paying your respects?'' Oakley asked. ``It's turned
into a freak show with a carnival atmosphere. I don't understand
why people leave (marijuana) roaches and liquor. Do they think
Duane and Berry get up at night and enjoy it?''
</P>
<P>
   But Rose Hill Cemetery belongs to the city, and Mayor Jim
Marshall said the fence had to go _ although he has found a donor
to replace it with something more aesthetic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfortunate that you've got a bunch of nuts abusing the
public right of access by engaging in all kinds of immoral and
illegal behavior around these grave sites. It's entirely legitimate
for her to want to protect her brother's grave, but this is not the
way,'' Marshall said.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of people have visited the graves of Allman and Oakley
since they died in motorcycle accidents about a year apart in 1971
and 1972. The two are buried side-by-side near the Ocmulgee River
in the cemetery, which was designed in 1839.
</P>
<P>
   The band is performing next Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday
and Sunday at the Fox Theatre.
</P>
<P>
   Oakley said she has photographs of beer cans, marijuana
cigarettes, lipstick kisses and people lounging on the graves.
People have chipped pieces of the marble stone and carved their
names and initials into it, Oakley said. She also said she has seen
people take nude photographs on the graves and has found condoms at
the site.
</P>
<P>
   The last straw, she said, came when ``someone tried to get into
the graves. They got down to the vault, and that stopped them.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Anthony, Macon's parks and recreation director, said,
``We are trying to work with her to get something more aesthetic
for a historic cemetery like this,'' he said. Other graves in Rose
Hill are fenced, he said, but with wrought iron, not chain link.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Marshall said, ``I have already found someone who will pay
for it. It's just a matter of working it out with the family.''
Marshall refused to identify the donor, but said he expected the
cost of a wrought iron fence with benches would run as high as
$25,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just can't be something that looks like Stalag 17,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Oakley, however, was not mollified. ``I've been told a wrought
iron fence will just be stolen,'' she said. ``I guess the mayor is
going to make me dig a little deeper and put up a mausoleum.''

 &HT;    COLUMN: In praise of oft-overlooked houseplants
 &HT;    By Lee May
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   During his latest visit to keep the roaches on the run, the bug
man and I were chatting about chores. I mentioned my need to water
my plants, and he said, as he was leaving, ``It just rained.
Doesn't look like you need to do any watering today.''
</P>
<P>
   Houseplants, I said. They need watering, too. And attention. A
little respect wouldn't hurt.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't enter the bug man's ken. And he's not alone. A lot
of gardeners give indoor gardening short shrift this time of year,
as the fall planting season beckons seductively. Fact is, though,
houseplants remained faithful during those hot summer months when
outdoor plants did everything they could to check out.
</P>
<P>
   On many days, when the misery index soared to a 9, heading
toward the maximum 10 (funny how some weather guessers love
flaming-hot temperatures just because the sun shines), houseplant
gardening was the only gardening I did.
</P>
<P>
   And now I anticipate a long, lush indoor season, focusing on it
in much the same way I look forward to spring in the outdoor
garden. It is in the cold days of winter that those oft-forgotten
indoor specimens will take center stage.
</P>
<P>
   On my plants' stage there will be a bit more room this fall and
winter, as I have moved a great many plants from Atlanta to the
cabin in McCaysville. Each specimen, then, will get better display
_ in both places. For example, the aralia in the Atlanta kitchen
looks a lot happier, now that it does not have to compete for
attention with the Boston fern and the maranta. Also, my Atlanta
home office feels a lot roomier, without the peace lily that has
moved to North Georgia, along with the ti plant, dumb cane, bamboo
and others.
</P>
<P>
   One huge space opened up with the jade plant's untimely death: a
gaping hole in the dining room decor. I did manage to save one jade
finger, which now grows in a much smaller pot than the one the sumo
jade occupied. If I can abstain from overwatering this little
survivor, it may one day turn into a nice living sculpture.
</P>
<P>
   The African violets have done as much as any plant to keep my
gardening muscles exercised, as most of the dozen or so always are
in bloom. I don't know how they keep performing so well with so
little rest, and I'm not going to try to figure it out.
</P>
<P>
   The lipstick plant got really busy this year, too, continually
producing burgundy-colored, trumpet-shaped blooms. Lovely.
</P>
<P>
   Ferns _ from the lacy asparagus in a bonsai tray to the zaftig
Boston hanging from the ceiling _ green up indoor spaces like
nothing else. And the rabbit's foot creeps and crawls, captivating
endlessly.
</P>
<P>
   The hardest-working vine in the house has to be pothos. Amazing
how little light this climber needs. Mine don't climb; they hang
from the tops of cabinets, painting the wood with touches of green
and white, getting trimmed from time to time when they start to
crawl along the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Crawling, hanging, standing, all my plants will share those
perfect days of autumn, when open windows admit breezes to delight
senses and ruffle leaves, reawakening both.
</P>
<P>
   On to winter, when indoor plants must endure conditions that
amount to a harsh flip side of their summer duty. In their time of
highest profile, they must survive dry heat _ just as they did dry
air conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   That, along with playing second string to the outdoor garden,
shows again that it isn't easy being green.

 &HT;    Centuries-old gardening tools and rare plants from the 1700s
find a home in London church
 &HT;    By Danny C. Flanders
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   London_It's a gardener's treasure chest _ a 17th-century
watering can, shovels more than 100 years old, an 1800s
wheelbarrow, even a Victorian cucumber straightener _ and the gems
aren't even outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   They're in church.
</P>
<P>
   Avid gardeners would agree a sanctuary's the perfect place to
pay homage to 300 years of tools that have made their lives easier.
</P>
<P>
   But because of its own legacy, the 17th-century church east of
London's Embankment is an even more appropriate home for the Museum
of Garden History _ the only one of its kind in the world. Its
churchyard contains the tomb of two famed plantsmen, a bit of
history that prompted Rosemary Nicholson and her late husband,
John, to establish their museum there.
</P>
<P>
   ``People thought we were absolutely mad,'' she says of the
struggle 20 years ago to convert the dilapidated church and
graveyard into a gallery and rare-plant repository. ``They would
ask, `Garden history? What's that? What do we need to know about
it?'''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently lots, as Americans' passion for gardening reaches
levels rivaling that of the British. ``Look at how many people are
doing it,'' says Nicholson, a redheaded senior with a persistent
grin. ``It's become such a pastime with everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, the museum director can bask in the success of a program
run by a staff of six and manned by 50 volunteers. But the couple's
struggles to save St. Mary at Lambeth from a developer's wrecking
ball, revive the building from decay and secure funding for museum
operations remain vivid.
</P>
<P>
   The Nicholsons first visited the site 25 years ago to see the
tomb of the two John Tradescants, the 17th-century father-and-son
horticulturists who served as royal gardeners. The younger also
drew fame for the plants he introduced from Virginia, including
tulip trees, spiderwort and columbine.
</P>
<P>
   What the Nicholsons found was not pretty. Stained-glass windows
in the church, deconsecrated in 1972, were boarded up, and birds
flew in and out of a hole in the roof. The floor had fallen in, and
old car parts littered a weed-infested yard. ``At that point, we
didn't want to see the tomb,'' Nicholson says.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the visit came more disappointment: They learned of
plans to build a walk along the Thames for the queen's 1977 Silver
Jubilee, and St. Mary's stood in the way. ``It just seemed so
dreadful that it would be demolished,'' Nicholson says of the
historic site, where six archbishops of Canterbury and Capt. Bligh
of HMS Bounty fame are buried.
</P>
<P>
   The Nicholsons immediately launched efforts to save it. The
three hurdles were leasing the property, getting it listed with the
English Heritage (similar to the National Register of Historic
Places) and forming a trust.
</P>
<P>
   Some church officials objected to allowing a use for the
structure other than worship, while others simply couldn't
understand the interest. ``They said,' It's a heap on stone ready
to come down,' '' Nicholson recalls.
</P>
<P>
   Even many of England's pre-eminent horticulturists scoffed at
the idea of a garden museum.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, backed by art collectors, the Nicholsons began a fund
drive, and Prince Charles became a patron of the trust.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the real dirty work began. ``We'd come down on weekends
with rubber gloves and black plastic bags to collect the rubble,''
Nicholson says.
</P>
<P>
   In the churchyard, a new garden was designed to include rare
plants and shrubs, many of which the Tradescants had grown or
introduced to England and all of which were donated by nurseries.
</P>
<P>
   Since opening in 1983, the museum has acquired an additional
building for offering seminars, and the collection has grown so
large the museum is raising money to expand.
</P>
<P>
   The inventory runs the gamut, from shears, scythes and snippers
to baskets, bell jars and ``bird scarers'' (Victorian-style,
green-eyed cat's heads designed to protect plants). There's a
display of insecticide pouffes and sprayers, a group of early lawn
mowers and desks once owned by famed plantswoman Gertrude Jekyll.
</P>
<P>
   ``The variety of stuff here is absolutely amazing,'' says Martha
Jenkins, a green thumb visiting from Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   And the most unusual item?
</P>
<P>
   Nicholson says it's the ``vegetable lamb,'' the root of a
specimen fern thought in the 11th century to resemble a small lamb.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are only four in the world,'' she says, adding with
pride, ``but ours is the best.''
</P>
<P>
   -- The Museum of Garden History is open Monday through Friday
from 10:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. and Sundays from 10:30 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Admission is free. Information: 011-44-171-401-8865c

 &HT;    Home Depot a small town's hero in deal with Emerson
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS, TENN. _ Home Depot is the toast of this tiny industrial
town midway between Nashville and Memphis.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the 10,000 residents likely have never shopped in a Home
Depot (the nearest store is about 70 miles away), but the
Atlanta-based home improvement retailer has become an instant
hometown hero as a result of its new contract with Emerson Tool
Co., the manufacturer that for decades churned out Sears Roebuck &AMP;
Co.'s Craftsman power tools. When Sears ditched Emerson last year
and took its Craftsman power tool production offshore, it created
an immediate scare among the factory's 400 employees that the plant
would shut down after losing its top customer.
</P>
<P>
   But it turned into a golden opportunity for Emerson and Home
Depot. ''We've been looking for this product for 15 years, but we
couldn't find a manufacturer that could match the quality,'' said
Home Depot Chairman Bernard Marcus in an interview at the Emerson
factory. ''I've had conversations with (Emerson) for eight years to
get them to make these tools for us, but they couldn't because of
the loyalty to Sears. When they came to us last year and asked if
we still wanted them, there was a lot of hugging and kissing at
that meeting.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a lot of fanfare at the Emerson plant on Friday, when
the companies celebrated the new partnership. Skydivers,
representatives from the Tennessee governor's office, a band and
Miss Tennessee joined about 600 Home Depot and Emerson employees to
welcome Marcus, who canceled his plans to visit the company's new
store in Santiago, Chile, that opened this week.
</P>
<P>
   Amid continual applause and Home Depot chants, plant manager
Bucky Purcell took a quick break from Marcus' plant tour to take it
all in. ''We've never had this much excitement here,'' Purcell
said. ''Arthur Martinez (Sears chairman and chief executive) never
came in.'' Marcus was careful to leave his mark at the
640,000-square-foot plant, autographing a giant orange Home Depot
logo emblazoned on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ''When it came time to look for another partner, Home Depot was
our first, second and third choice,'' said Dave Pringle, president
of Emerson Tool Co. The tool factory in Paris is one of 60
divisions of St. Louis-based Emerson Electric, founded in 1890 as a
manufacturer of electric motors and fans. Emerson, whose brands
include Louisville Ladder, Vermont American and Western Forge, had
revenue of $12.3 billion last year.
</P>
<P>
   While Emerson is undoubtedly grateful for the new partnership,
Home Depot is also capitalizing on the opportunity in a big way.
For the first time, the company will now have its own brand of
high-quality, durable power tools, which it will position and price
midway between the do-it-yourself and professional markets. The
tools, which include table saws, sanders and other power products,
will be sold under Emerson's Ridgid logo, a 75-year-old brand name
widely known in the plumbing industry.
</P>
<P>
   Emerson developed a new product line of bench top and stationary
power tools, including table saws and an oscillating sander, for
the exclusive Home Depot partnership.
</P>
<P>
   The Sears contract officially ends Oct. 1. Emerson is busy
stocking a two-month supply of products for Home Depot, and the new
Ridgid line has already hit some stores, although it begins the
official rollout across the country next month. Home Depot has been
selling Ridgid wet/dry vacuums since May.
</P>
<P>
   Emerson is already working on more plans with Home Depot. ''Last
year we were in a phase of downsizing, but now we're in a growth
mode,'' said Charles Knight, chairman and chief executive of
Emerson Electric. ''We're already working on more products.''

 &HT;    Atlanta churches are reviving the tradition of a medieval
labyrinth.
 &HT;    By Gayle White
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA_With the soft swish of sock feet on canvas, walkers step
methodically along a white path on a purple background at Holy
Trinity Episcopal Church in Decatur, Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   They are moving physically and spiritually through a labyrinth,
a carefully prescribed, centuries-old design being rediscovered
across the country as a tool of meditation and worship. Atlanta's
Episcopal Cathedral of St. Philip has a new canvas labyrinth and
Cedar Hill Enrichment Center in Forsyth County has held workshops
for people interested in learning about the ancient tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something we can't explain about the pattern of the
labyrinth that seems to help people very quickly to get into a
meditative state, to find their center very quickly,'' said the
Rev. Susan Latimer, assistant to the rector at St. Bartholomew's
Episcopal Church in the Toco Hill area of Atlanta. ``Many people
find somehow in their walk that they come out with a feeling of
God's love and care for them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Holy Trinity labyrinth is modeled after one built into the
floor of the cathedral in Chartres, France, about the year 1200.
Its path twists and turns 34 times through 11 concentric circles to
a six-petaled rosette center. Walkers traditionally follow the path
into the center, stop to meditate, then follow the path back out.
</P>
<P>
   A labyrinth is not a maze, with false starts and dead ends.
Instead, it has one clear but winding path. Although the physical
path is narrow and serpentine, the spiritual journey of the
labyrinth is totally unscripted. All who step onto the pattern find
their own way.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, the key is to be totally open,'' said Kit Kamper, 55, a
Holy Trinity member from Decatur and a regular labyrinth walker.
``It's not a matter of doing or solving or resolving for me. It's a
matter of being with God.''
</P>
<P>
   Kamper said she usually walks the labyrinth at night by
candlelight, but one early morning experience was especially
memorable. ``The sun was pouring in and there were these beams of
sunlight coming onto the labyrinth,'' she said. ``The morning was
cool but the sun was hot. I felt as if I were swimming underwater
and feeling the icy cold of the water, and then a warm pocket. That
experience was very exciting and very intimate.''
</P>
<P>
   Kamper, a software engineer, said she intentionally does not
analyze or interpret her feelings. ``That can be limiting,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Dale Miller, 54, a United Methodist who recently walked the
Holy Trinity labyrinth for the first time, came with a list of
specific prayer subjects: her recently married son and his wife;
her younger son, who just finished graduate school; and a friend
whose sister has pancreatic cancer. She also brought gratitude for
her family, her kindergarten students and co-workers at DeKalb
County's Medlock Elementary School as the new year began.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me the act of walking is therapeutic if you're trying to
sort things out,'' she said. ``It was an opportunity when I could
focus on God, what I would hear from him and what I would like to
say to him.''
</P>
<P>
   The rapidly growing interest in the spiritual possibilities of
the labyrinth can be traced to the Rev. Lauren Artress, an
Episcopal priest and canon of Grace Cathedral in San Francisco.
During a retreat, she ``stumbled upon'' the tradition of the
labyrinth, little used for the past 350 years, and began to
research it.
</P>
<P>
   Artress learned that a form of the labyrinth has been used in
many religious traditions and cultures, including Native American
and Egyptian. Patterns have been seen on Cretan coins and Tibetan
sand paintings.
</P>
<P>
   During the Middle Ages, when political struggles made
pilgrimages to Jerusalem too dangerous and expensive for
Christians, the Roman Catholic Church established seven
``pilgrimage'' cathedrals, including the one in Chartres, where
people could use labyrinths to make symbolic journeys to the Holy
City.
</P>
<P>
   Artress visited Chartres, determined to walk the long-unused
labyrinth there. After moving 256 chairs to uncover the pattern,
she and some friends made their walk. ``I feel we had touched the
Holy Spirit,'' she wrote in the introduction to her book, ``Walking
a Sacred Path'' (Riverhead Books, 1995, $11).
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, Artress supervised construction of a labyrinth for her
own parish, which has since added an outdoor version.
</P>
<P>
   Like many people from across the country, Latimer attended a
workshop at Grace. She left determined to bring the concept of the
labyrinth with her to Holy Trinity, where she then worked. Church
members donated the money for supplies, drew the pattern, painted
it and sewed it themselves. It was consecrated last September.
</P>
<P>
   Latimer would like to have an outdoor version in Atlanta,
perhaps at St. Bartholomew's.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Chartres pattern has strong ties to Christianity,
the Holy Trinity labyrinth draws people of many different religious
walks.
</P>
<P>
   Janice Goldstein, 75, of Dunwoody is a member of Temple
Emanu-El, a Reform Jewish congregation. She said she found peace in
the labyrinth, which she walked for the first time in June. ``I was
void of all tension and stress,'' she said. ``I found myself under
a spell of total relaxation.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Goldstein returned, bringing her friend Doree Kenler,
who is also Jewish, on an outing celebrating Kenler's 81st
birthday.
</P>
<P>
   For David Cates, 35, walking the labyrinth is a variation of the
walking meditation he learned as a Buddhist. Cates, a former
Southern Baptist, recently moved to Atlanta after 4 1/2 years in
Japan. He said he found in Buddhism a freedom for critical inquiry
and a strong sense of compassion.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just wonderful,'' he said after finishing the Holy
Trinity walk with sister-in-law Judi Robinson, 43, of Norcross.
``It's very peaceful and centering. When I knew I was getting
toward the end, I wanted it to keep going.''

 &HT;    B'nai B'rith collects furry friends for kids
 &HT;    By Derrick Henry
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA_Stuffed animals are cute and cuddly and have a way of
making children feel better.
</P>
<P>
   That's the belief of B'nai B'rith members who are collecting
hundreds of such dolls to give to children at hospitals in metro
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about bringing a smile to faces of kids who don't have a
lot of reason to smile,'' says Helaine Fruchtman, B'nai B'rith's
Southeast regional director.
</P>
<P>
   The collection program, B'nai B'rith Cares for Kids, begins
Tuesday. The drive will continue through September and will
culminate Oct. 4, when the stuffed animals will be given to
patients _ newborns to teens _ at Scottish Rite Children's Medical
Center, Egleston Children's Hospital and Hughes Spalding Children's
Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't wait to see the children's faces light up when we
present them with a cute teddy bear,'' says volunteer Jerry
Kravitz, regional chairman of the B'nai B'rith Center for Community
Action.
</P>
<P>
   Kravitz, 62, a resident of Roswell and a consultant for the
travel industry, has been volunteering with the Jewish service
organization for nearly 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   During September, Kravitz and others will be collecting new
stuffed animals from individuals, businesses and organizations.
Collection boxes will be placed in synagogues and businesses
throughout metro Atlanta. People can also donate money for the
cause _ a $10 contribution buys one bear; $18 will buy two.
</P>
<P>
   And volunteers are being sought to pick up and sort the bears in
late September and to deliver them to the children in October.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an opportunity for B'nai B'rith to give back not only
to the Jewish community, but the community at large, and in a way
that provides immediate impact both to the children and to the
volunteers,'' says Fruchtman.
</P>
<P>
   The local group's stuffed animal drive is the Southeastern pilot
for a campaign B'nai B'rith started in Houston in 1996. ``The kids
were thrilled and the hospital was delighted,'' says Thomas Wolff,
director of B'nai B'rith's Texarkoma (Texas, Arkansas, Oklahoma)
region.
</P>
<P>
   Since the program started, about 8,500 stuffed animals have been
donated to hospitals, shelters and schools.

<P>
   -- At a glance: Founded in New York in 1843 by 12 German-Jewish
immigrants, B'nai B'rith (``Children of the Covenant'') is the
oldest service organization started in the United States. It has
grown into what is claimed to be the world's largest service
organization, with 230,000 members in 57 countries on six
continents.
</P>
<P>
   -- Programs: Projects include funding emergency relief,
sponsoring affordable housing for senior citizens, espousing Jewish
causes and human rights, and youth programs.

   HONGKONG-ECON (Hong Kong) _ In the climax of an unprecedented
two-week-long direct intervention in the stock market, Hong Kong's
government spent what traders estimated at $8 billion Friday in a
frenzied buying spree to prop up shares and foil speculators it
accuses of manipulating its market. On Thursday, an earlier round
of intervention had managed to push the Hong Kong stock market up
while every other market around the globe was down. Friday, for all
the money spent, the benchmark Hang Seng index still declined 93.23
points, or 1.2 percent, to 7,829.74. By Mark Landler.

THE RACE FOR THE EIGHTH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, August 30, 1998)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH

<P>
   The Eighth is the most famous congressional district in
Massachusetts, possibly in the nation. Created by gerrymander in
1942, the district has been represented by James Michael Curley,
John F. Kennedy, Thomas P. ``Tip'' O'Neill Jr., and, most recently,
Joseph P. Kennedy III. Now with Kennedy going back to private life,
the seat is up again, and its new occupant will immediately step
into a national as well as a local role.
</P>
<P>
   The significance of the district stems, not so much from
colorful history, but from the political energy generated by the
tension between the oldest Americans and the newest. The Eighth
contains half of Boston, plus the old satellite cities of
Cambridge, Chelsea, Somerville, and Watertown, as well as the leafy
suburb of Belmont.
</P>
<P>
   The congressperson from the Eighth represents the interests of
the Arbella and of Harvard College, represents also all the
successive waves of immigrants who came after _ the Latin Americans
and the Portuguese as well as the Irish and Italians. All that
history means a never-ceasing search for common ground.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder that Gerald Sullivan and Michael Kenney wrote in ``The
Race for The Eighth,'' their book describing the memorable year
(1986) in which Joe Kennedy won the seat, that it was possible that
``there was not a more liberal district in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Has it changed?
</P>
<P>
   With just over two weeks until the decisive primary _ there is a
Republican, Philip Hyde III, on the ballot, as well as an
independent, Anthony Schinella, but neither has a ghost of a chance
in November _ many persons believe that the contest now has come
down to a two-person race. The final face-off between former Boston
mayor Ray Flynn and Somerville mayor Michael Capuano is a
consequence of the large field.
</P>
<P>
   For months, it had been a three-person race, depending on whose
partisans you talked to: Marjorie Clapprood, Flynn and Capuano
(she's the radio talk show host and former state legislator;) or
George Bachrach, Flynn and Capuano (he's the durable liberal who
lost to Joe Kennedy in 1986). Or Susan Tracy, Flynn and Capuano
(she's a former state rep with strong liberal credentials.)
</P>
<P>
   The three millionaires _ software entrepreneur Chris Gabrieli,
environmental activist John O'Connor, and Boston city councillor
Tom Keane _ failed to attract much support despite liberal
applications of cash. The two minority candidates, Alex Rodriguez
and Charles Yancey, were unable to get beyond their small bases.
Peter Galbraith, former ambassador to Yugoslavia (and son of the
famous Harvard economist) dropped out of the race.
</P>
<P>
   So now it is simply Flynn and Capuano, because it is pretty
clear that none of the others has a chance of beating Flynn, who
long ago coasted to a lead in the polls on the strength of name
recognition. (Some polls still show George Bachrach in the race,
but as a lobbyist-lawyer long out of office he has little
street-level organization.)
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, Flynn and Capuano are remarkably similar.
</P>
<P>
   Both are hometown boys, husbands of strong women, sons of
parents who were themselves deeply rooted in their communities.
Both have been successful mayors, with excellent records on racial
issues. Flynn rode into office on the strength of his peacemaking
during Boston's busing crisis in the 1970s. Capuano has presided
over the smooth racial integration of his city.
</P>
<P>
   Each possesses unmistakable star quality; each is a person
you're glad to be around. (Disclaimer: I live in Somerville and
have known Capuano slightly for many years; I work in Boston and
have covered Flynn in various connections.)
</P>
<P>
   There, however, the similarity ends.
</P>
<P>
   Capuano is 46, Flynn is 59. The Somerville mayor still has kids
at home. A graduate of Dartmouth and Boston College law school, he
has been elected five times mayor of his city of 90,000, but much
of his career lies ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Flynn's family of six children, on the other hand, has been
raised; his formative days as an All-American basketball player at
Providence College are far behind (though he still jogs six or
eight miles a day). For many years he was a state representative
and city councillor; after three terms as mayor, he spent four
controversial years in Rome as Bill Clinton's ambassador to the
Vatican and occasional emmisary to global disaster spots, before
resigning.
</P>
<P>
   Capuano is quick, hot, sometimes pugnacious. Flynn is slow,
mild, low-key to the point of sometimes being glassy-eyed. Flynn is
populist in his sentiments; Capuano is a lunch-bucket technocrat.
He likes budget and policy debates; his mastery of the
nuts-and-bolts of government programs is Clintonesque. Flynn
specializes in symbolic politics and the human touch. (As mayor, he
made a habit of bounding into burning buildings.)
</P>
<P>
   Within his administration, Capuano is leaderly. He possesses a
good sense of how markets work and how they fail. He initiated
cable competition, and privatized his city's garbage collection _
but otherwise brought city services in-house through retraining and
higher pay. No city worker lost his job, and flex-time,
job-sharing, paid parental leave &UR; , &LR;  and on-site day-care became
staples of union contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Flynn, on the other hand, often has been guided by his aides,
for good and ill. His city planner Stephen Coyle was a spectacular
success, but his campaign bookkeeper went to jail for embezzling.
In Rome, it was said that after weeks of not coming to the embassy,
he had to call an aide when he could no longer remember the
building's access code.
</P>
<P>
   On the fundamental issue of schooling, the mayors' records are
worlds apart. The Boston schools are still a mess, despite a
determined effort by Tom Menino, who has been mayor since 1993;
they suffered from considerable inattention on Flynn's watch.
Somerville schools, on the other hand, are up and coming; average
class size is 19, and six new schools designed to serve as
community centers as well have been built.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most significantly for voters in the Eighth, the
candidates differ sharply on the issue of abortion. Capuano is
pro-choice; Flynn is pro-life. Nor do they differ only on life in
the womb. Flynn opposed various school sex education measures while
mayor Capuano lobbied succesfully in his socially conservative
community for sex education, as well as counseling on sexually
transmitted diseases, family violence, and gender equity.
</P>
<P>
   The next person to represent the district could be in Washington
for a long time. Capuano plays well with others; he would
contribute to the strength of his delegation. Flynn is unaccustomed
to team play. The Eighth won't lose reputation for political
originality with either candidate. But it has much to gain from
choosing the younger man.

   &QL; 
LINCOLN, Neb. _ Frank Solich admits he will be happy to get this
day behind him.
</P>
<P>
   Solich has been asked a thousand times what it feels like to
replace a legend, and he hopes those questions will end, or at
least taper off, once the Nebraska Cornhuskers get a game under
their belts without Tom Osborne's stoic presence on the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   The Cornhuskers, ranked fourth in the nation in preseason polls,
play Louisiana Tech today in the Eddie Robinson Classic. It will be
Solich's debut as a head coach and the first time in 25 years
Osborne will not call the shots in front of a sea of red at
Memorial Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``To get this game going will be a blessing for everybody,''
said Solich, who was an assistant under Osborne for 19 years. ``We
think we have a quality team, and we know we are going up against a
quality opponent.''
</P>
<P>
   Louisiana Tech might not be close to the level of a team that
was a co-national champion last season, but the Bulldogs were 9-2
and return one of the best quarterbacks in the nation. Tom Rattay,
a 6-1, 200-pound junior, passed for a school-record 3,881 yards and
34 touchdowns last season.
</P>
<P>
   Those numbers seem more impressive when you realize Terry
Bradshaw is the player Rattay passed in the Louisiana Tech record
book.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a great deal of respect for Louisiana Tech,'' said
Nebraska quarterback Bobby Newcombe. ``We're going to play this
game like it was our last instead of our first. We have to win the
first one and go from there.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with Solich, Newcombe is the player most of the 73,000
people at the game are coming to see. The talented sophomore will
make his first start as the signal-caller for Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bobby certainly is fast,'' said Nebraska linebacker Jay
Foreman. ``There are times when you think you have him, then he has
that little bit of extra speed, a burst that leaves you behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Newcombe, who played receiver and returned punts as a freshman,
said he knows how Solich feels because both will be the center of
attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, coach Solich and I will be nervous, but we both have a
lot of confidence,'' Newcombe said. ``We're comfortable with the
expectations. It's just one of those things that comes with playing
football at Nebraska.''
</P>
<P>
   Playing quarterback at Nebraska automatically invites scrutiny.
Last season, quarterback Scott Frost criticized the fans for
questioning his ability. Newcombe has not taken a snap in a game at
the position, but he has been compared to former Nebraska
All-America quarterback Tommie Frazier.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tommie told me there would be a lot of pressure but that I
would do fine,'' Newcombe said. ``He told me to relax and go with
the flow. I know I'm prepared for this.''
</P>
<P>
   Solich, 54, believes he has prepared himself for all the
comparisons to Osborne that will come over the course of this
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope to keep doing a lot of the things that made this
program successful,'' Solich said. ``I don't believe my style is
much different than Tom's. I will try to do a lot of the things he
did, because he did things the right way. I have no designs for
placing my own stamp on the program. That will take care of itself
if we keep the team at a high level.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Cornhuskers enter today's game with some question marks,
especially on the offensive line. Only Josh Heskew returns as a
starter up front.
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska also will have to play the first two or three games
without tailback DeAngelo Evans, the man designated to replace
Ahman Green. Evans had arthroscopic knee surgery this week to
repair a torn cartilage.
</P>
<P>
   But a new coach, an injured running back and a lot of new faces
on the offensive line probably won't keep the Cornhuskers from
rolling to another home victory. Nebraska hasn't lost in Lincoln
since 1991, a span of 42 games.
</P>
<P>
   The 'Huskers also haven't lost a season opener since 1985. Those
milestones, along with taking over for a man who won three national
championships in his last four seasons, doesn't make things easier
for Solich.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know there's going to be pressure on coach Solich,'' said
Nebraska fullback Joel Makovicka. ``But we can take the pressure
away by playing well. The approach is the same under coach Solich.
He has us working for perfection, and I think people around here
respond to that. They did under coach Osborne, and they will under
coach Solich.''
</P>
<P>
   After all, Solich isn't an outsider. He became a part of the
Nebraska family when he played fullback for the Cornhuskers 35
years ago under Bob Devaney _ the legendary coach Osborne replaced.
So Solich knows taking over for a legend can be a successful
endeavor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not easy to follow Tom,'' Solich said. ``There are a lot
of people around the country who will look at this program and feel
it will keep rolling along. But that only will happen if we recruit
well, prepare well and keep a great staff. We have worked very
hard, and now it's time to show what we can do.''

RUSSIAN ECONOMIC WOES POSE NEW THREAT TO SPACE STATION, U.S.
LAWMAKER WARNS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK CARREAU 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Russia's latest economic upheaval poses a new threat
to the U.S.-led international space station, the chairman of NASA's
House oversight committee warned Friday.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. James Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., head of the House Science
Committee, issued the warning as he completed a closed-door meeting
with NASA's top station program managers at the Johnson Space
Center.
</P>
<P>
   The more than five-year effort to assemble the laboratory in
Earth orbit is scheduled to begin in late November, a year behind
schedule due primarily to Russia's failure to adequately fund its
crucial contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Sensenbrenner blamed the Clinton administration for the prospect
of further postponements, claiming policy-makers have turned a deaf
ear to warnings from Congress as well as NASA and its independent
consultants that Russia is not up to the task.
</P>
<P>
   ``Statements of confidence in Russian performance on the station
in the near term contradict all the current economic and political
indicators in Russia,'' said Sensenbrenner, a reference to White
House assurances made as recently as Aug. 5.
</P>
<P>
   A staunch supporter of the station, the Wisconsin lawmaker has
nonetheless challenged the wisdom of the administration's 1993
invitation for the Russians to join the project. By late 1995, it
was clear the Russians could not or would not meet key development
milestones.
</P>
<P>
   ``The White House, very honestly, has been in denial since
then,'' Sensenbrenner said.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmaker suggested that support within Congress for the
space station would remain strong even if Russia dropped out of the
project and U.S. costs escalated.
</P>
<P>
   ``You simply cannot build the space station that taxpayers
expect around the Russians if the Russians are not going to meet
their obligations,`` said Sensenbrenner. ``The odds are good that
Congress would be willing to view past failures as water under the
bridge.``
</P>
<P>
   Russia's contributions to the project include a habitable
42,000-pound component called the service module, Soyuz capsules to
transport crews to the station and serve as lifeboats, and dozens
of unmanned Progress capsule launches with the fuel that will be
needed to keep the station flying at a safe altitude.
</P>
<P>
   The assembly is scheduled to begin with the Nov. 20 launching of
the U.S.-financed, Russian-crafted control module. It is to be
followed in early December by a structural passageway that will
link future U.S. and Russian segments.
</P>
<P>
   The crucial Russian service module is set for an April 1999
launching. Without it, the first crew of astronauts and cosmonauts
cannot take up residence as planned next July.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's lack of funding for the module produced the earlier
postponements and forced the United States to initiate the
development of a replacement module that can perform the propulsion
duties of the service module, but not its life support function.
</P>
<P>
   Though the service module is nearly built, the installation of
final components and launch preparations have again fallen behind
schedule. Russian funding for station work has reached only $20
million so far this year, less than 10 percent of the requirement,
and one of NASA's consultants has suggested it may be necessary for
the United States to pay Russian contractors directly to complete
the task.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and Russian engineers are scheduled to meet in late
September in Moscow to formally appraise the readiness of the
service module and make other schedule assessments. NASA is also
concerned that Russia is not acquiring the components that will be
needed for the Progress supply ships that will be needed once
construction gets under way.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something we have to continually watch,'' James
Hartsfield, a NASA station program spokesman, said Friday. ``We
haven't had anything of concern to the point that we want to
reschedule launches.''

WITH RUSSIA IN TURMOIL, SOME FEEL NOSTALGIA FOR CZARIST DAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ As some Russian leaders are looking back to the
Communist days in search of ways to pull the reeling nation out of
its tailspin, other Russians are looking back even further _ to the
days of the czars.
</P>
<P>
   While coping with its economic and political crises, Russia also
is enduring the latest of many painful shake-ups in place names,
national symbols and recognized heroes, part of the country's
tradition of regularly reinventing its past.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the country's poverty and financial turmoil, its leaders
continue to build grandiose monuments and reconstruct symbols of
days gone by, such as the Cathedral of Jesus Christ the Savior,
rebuilt at a cost of at least $300 million 60 years after Soviet
dictator Joseph Stalin had it blown up.
</P>
<P>
   It is unsettling to some younger Russians. ``Why do we do this
when we cannot feed our old people?'' asked Misha, a government
employee who asked that his full name not be used.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of rebuilding a huge cathedral, a ``small monument''
should have been erected at the site of Stalin's vandalism, said
Nina Novikova, 23, a recent university graduate. ``It would have
served the same purpose,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Symbols of the past are all most Russians have to celebrate. Its
recent leaders are vastly unpopular. Mikhail Gorbachev is blamed
for the disintegration of the Soviet Union. Boris Yeltsin is seen
as ineffectual, enjoying the good life while the vast majority of
his countrymen have seen their standard of living go through the
floor.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, in recent times, it has been out with the new and
in with the old symbols of the Orthodox church and pre-1917,
czarist Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Names of Bolshevik heroes have been stripped from the country's
cities. Leningrad has reverted to St. Petersburg, the name given by
its czar founder, Peter the Great.
</P>
<P>
   In its third nomenclature this century, the name Tsarskoe Selo
(the ``Tsar's Village'') has been reattached to the town near St.
Petersburg where Catherine the Great built her summer palace. The
Soviets had first renamed it Detsoe Selo (``Children's Village'')
and later changed the name to Pushkin on the 100th anniversary of
the poet's birth.
</P>
<P>
   While busts of Lenin are still so ubiquitous that the Soviet
Union's founder is informally known as the pigeon's friend, other
Bolsheviks have been treated roughly in death.
</P>
<P>
   Statues of such Soviet heroes as Feliks Dzerzhinsky and Mikhail
Kalinin have been torn down and dragged to the New Tratyakov
Gallery in Moscow. The founder of the Soviet secret police, and the
puppet yes-man president under Stalin, can be found scattered in
the grass in what has been titled the Garden of Sculpture of the
Epoch of Totalitarianism.
</P>
<P>
   The ups and down of Marshal Georgi Zhukov, in death as well as
life, are instructive.
</P>
<P>
   Zhukov was a hero of World War II, which Russians call the Great
Patriotic War. He directed the defense of Leningrad and Moscow, and
drove German forces all the way back to Berlin. It was Zhukov's
soldiers who planted a Soviet flag atop the Reichstag on May 1,
1945, a day after Adolf Hitler committed suicide.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Army marshal was so popular, however, that a year later
the jealous Stalin had him exiled to an obscure command in Odessa
by the Black Sea.
</P>
<P>
   Zhukov returned to the Kremlin after the dictator's death. In
1957, as Soviet defense minister, he used military planes to fly
central committee members to Moscow _ and help Nikita Khrushchev
turn back a challenge from Stalin's henchmen. Less than a year
later, however, Khrushchev fired him.
</P>
<P>
   Zhukov disappeared from war histories during his times of exile,
and died in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1990s, however, he has made a posthumus comeback. It
turns out that Zhukov is one Soviet-era figure who can safely be
celebrated in post-Communist Russia. He was a genuine national
hero, with the courage to bluntly speak his mind to Stalin. He also
was known to keep a religious icon in his home.
</P>
<P>
   Today, a statue of Zhukov has been erected just outside Red
Square.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest and gaudiest example of Russia's changing
symbolism is the Cathedral of Jesus Christ the Savior, built in the
1800s to give thanks to God for Russia's victory over Napoleon.
</P>
<P>
   ``On Christmas and Easter as many as 15,000 people squeezed
inside the cathedral _ all carrying beeswax candles _ and soloists
from the Bolshoi Theatre would sing the holiday chants and hymns,''
author David Remnick wrote in ``Resurrection: The Struggle for a
New Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   Stalin had other ideas. After the cathedral was reduced to
rubble in 1931 _ it took 18 months to cart the debris away _ he
aimed to built a Palace of Soviets higher than the Empire State
Building. It was to be topped by a statue of Lenin that would dwarf
the Statue of Liberty.
</P>
<P>
   The dictator was thwarted when dozens of natural springs were
discovered on the site. Soviet rulers eventually gave up on their
palace. Instead, Khrushchev ordered the erection of what he called
``the biggest swimming pool in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, however, Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov decided the
cathedral would be rebuilt. Luzhkov presided over privatizing
property in Moscow, which gave opportunities to make great fortunes
to well-connected businessmen. In turn, Luzhkov could call on the
city's new oligarchs to help put up money for the church.
</P>
<P>
   The cathedral has arisen, a gleaming competitor for attention
with the nearby Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   Other Luzhkov projects have included a refurbished Bolshoi
Theatre, a restored Resurrection Gate at the entrance to Red
Square, an underground shopping mall and an enormous hilltop war
memorial complex complete with museum and Orthodox Church.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Alexander Tkachenko, an Orthodox priest in St.
Petersburg, was asked why such former Communist Party apparatchiks
as Yeltsin, Luzhkov and St. Petersburg governor Vladimir Yakovlev
have latched onto religious symbolism.
</P>
<P>
   He replied that such symbolism is essential in holding together
a fractious, fractured country _ whether the leaders are believers
or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeltsin is a Russian man, of course,'' said Tkachenko. ``He is
a politician. He understands that only the church can preserve
Russia from civil war. Only the church has kept alive cultural
traditions. Only the church prevents moral destruction.''
</P>
<P>
   While Russia builds symbols, its people must still eat. Beggars
have flocked to the square outside the Cathedral of Jesus Christ
the Savior. Outside Luzhkov's projects on the edge of Red Square,
elderly women trudge with heavy sacks.
</P>
<P>
   Well-dressed Russians summoned the old ladies by whispering,
``Babushka! Babushka!'', the term of endearment that roughly means
grandmother. The women would furtively look around for police.
Reaching into the sacks, they produced bottles of beer and canned
gin drinks at a fraction of the price charged at nearby bars.
</P>
<P>
   By such means do people survive amidst the renewed glories of
the ``new Russia.''

YELTSIN, ON TV, APPEARS TO BE IN POOR HEALTH 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ If putting President Boris Yeltsin on the
government-owned television network Friday night in a staged
interview was supposed to restore public faith in his ability to
govern, it was not much of a success.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looked like Chernenko,'' said Leonid Radzikhovsky, a
political commentator for the newspaper Sevodnya, referring to the
Soviet leader best known for shuffling through his last months in
office, supported at the elbow by attentive aides.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday night, Yeltsin's face looked puffy, his gestures were
uncoordinated and his words, which came slowly and with labored
pauses, were a wooden echo of the kind of language he would have
used 15 years ago, as a Communist first secretary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Assignments have now been given to the Central Bank, the
government,'' he said. ``Everything is spelled out in detail, what
should be done, how, in what direction, everything.'' He sat across
the table from his interviewer, Nikolai Zvanidze, and referred at
one point, oddly, to his Cabinet members as ``cadres.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We must strictly comply with what is written there,'' Yeltsin
intoned.
</P>
<P>
   What detailed instructions? About those the president said
nothing, just as his prime minister, Viktor Chernomyrdin, has yet
to explain the decisions he said he had made on Thursday to start
bringing the country out of its spiraling crisis.
</P>
<P>
   So the Russian public, or the small portion that tuned in to a
government-run channel after the 8 p.m. news, remained in the dark
Friday night, just it has have been all week.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for some Russians, seeing the president was enough to
reassure them that the political situation has not changed utterly,
at least not yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be frank, he looks really bad. He has such bags under his
eyes,'' said Tatyana Levitskaya, 53, a gynecologist. ``But
everybody felt better after watching him.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Levitskaya admits that she alone among her family and
friends does not criticize the president. But she said they shared
her relief Friday night. ``We need stability. He is our
stability,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Like other savvy Russians, she saw his meeting Friday with
political leaders including Mayor Yuri Luzhkov of Moscow, as a sign
that the president was regrouping his political forces to do battle
with an emboldened Communist opposition. ``Yeltsin is saying,
`Don't play around, boys _ I am still here,''' said Mrs.
Levitskaya.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin emphatically rebutted rumors that he will resign before
the end of his term in 2000, while the more pertinent question
about his willingness to cede some of his constitutional authority
didn't come up.
</P>
<P>
   But this is the same man who two weeks ago said that he would
not allow the ruble to be devalued and that he would stand by his
young embattled prime minister, Sergei Kiriyenko. With the ruble
now down by almost 100 percent, and Kiriyenko looking for a new
job, few Russians at this point are ready to take Yeltsin's word at
face value about anything, including resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors that he will step down soon after his new prime minister
and political heir, Chernomyrdin, is confirmed by the parliament
next week, continue apace, breaking down into elaborate and
conflicting scenarios about how the succession will take place.
</P>
<P>
   Another, complementary rumor holds that Yeltsin suffered a
stroke in recent weeks. If true, this is unlikely to be confirmed
as long as he is in office. But whatever the official health
bulletins may say, the president did not look well Friday night,
certainly not as well as most 67-year-olds who have just returned
to work after a five-week vacation.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Russians have gotten used to their president's enfeebled state,
and they cringe when he is shown on television pounding his fists
or breaking into what Radzikhovsky described as ``that silly
smile.'' He is reportedly deaf in one ear, but that doesn't explain
his inability at times to grasp the questions put to him during his
rare encounters with the press.
</P>
<P>
   His reputation for gaffes and misstatements is such that when
Pavel Voshchanov, his former press secretary, watched him on
television Friday night, he thought it wasn't as bad as it might
have been. ``He didn't say anything strange or wild, on the one
hand,'' said Voshchanov. ``On the other hand, his condition is not
good. And there is nobody left around him who knows how to put him
in shape.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been other times when Yeltsin has been sick or
absent, or both. And each time he has been able to bounce back
sufficiently to take command and swing events his way. Although
Yeltsin watchers say that he hasn't worked more than a few hours a
day for much of this year, he made a good show last April, rallying
support for Kiriyenko's confirmation and lending his weight to the
government's appeals for international monetary relief.
</P>
<P>
   But this time may be different. By ruling himself out of the
running in the next presidential elections, Yeltsin on Friday night
officially became a lame duck _ not a comfortable position for any
Russian leader, even one in the best of health.

importance of Japan, along with its misery: When trading ended
Friday in Tokyo, Japanese stocks this week alone had dropped in
value by $241 billion _ a sum that exceeds the size of the entire
Russian economy at present exchange rates. Japan is so monumental
as to be central to the health of the global economy, but for now
it remains a mess, albeit an impressively large one. A month after
Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi took office, vowing ``to deal with each
issue in a dramatic, speedy way,'' Japan remains firmly in
recession and largely paralyzed politically and economically. By

CAPE COD SAID RABIES FREE AFTER 5-YEAR WILDLIFE PROGRAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIEGO RIBADENEIRA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOURNE, Mass. _ Five years after the state began dropping
vaccine-laced raccoon bait from the sky by helicopter, officials
Friday declared the Cape and Islands free of the dangerous disease.
</P>
<P>
   The success of the pilot program, which has been expanded to
include other towns in southeastern Massachusetts, comes at a time
when rabies is making a rebound in the Bay State. Raccoon-strain
rabies, by far the most common in the state, entered Massachusetts
in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, more than 2,500 animals have tested positive for
rabies in areas throughout the state _ except for the area in the
pilot program. Rabies in humans is fatal unless treated quickly
with injections. House pets, mostly dogs and cats, are the usual
bridge between rabies-infected wild animals and humans.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Alison Robbins, a Tufts veterinarian who helps direct the
pilot program, said Massachusetts has the oldest and most
successful rabies eradication program in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we continue to expand the rabies-free zone in our state, we
are proactively sharing our knowledge and experience with our
colleagues in at least seven other states, Canada, France, Belgium,
and other nations,'' Robbins said.
</P>
<P>
   In the pilot program, oral vaccines placed inside baits made
with fishmeal are scatterred on the ground for raccoons to find.
</P>
<P>
   ``The oral vaccine program has exceeded all our expectations,''
said Dr. Alfred DeMaria, director of the bureau of communicable
disease control for the state Department of Public Health, which
runs the program, along with Tufts University's School of
Veterinary Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public health benefits to people living or spending time
on Cape Cod are unquestionable,'' DeMaria said in a Bourne news
conference Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The program has been expanded beyond Cape Cod to include
Plymouth and Wareham and about half of Carver. As more funds become
available, officials plan to continue expanding the vaccination
program north and west.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot program costs about $100,000 per year, but could save
public health money in the long run, DeMaria said. In 1995, he
said, the state spent between $4 million and $5 million to treat
people exposed to rabies. Each series of human vaccinations costs
about $2,500.
</P>
<P>
   ``In an ideal world, we'd like to get the other New England
states involved, so we could start working in concentric circles
and eventually have all of New England covered,'' said Dr. Steven
Powell, director of the division of laboratories at Tufts
Veterinary School and a principal investigator for the pilot
program. ``But that all is dependent on the funding situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Public health officials say there is a greater sense of urgency
to find ways to combat rabies, because the disease is making a
strong comeback in Massachusetts. In 1995, at the height of the
previous epidemic, about 2,700 people in the state were vaccinated
for exposure to rabies. Deaths are rare; nationwide, one or two
persons die each year from rabies, on average.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1996 and 1997, the number of new cases of animal rabies
in Massachusetts more than doubled, from 115 to 282. The evidence
this year shows a continued increase. July and August are peak
months for new cases, state health officials say.
</P>
<P>
   In the pilot program, the vaccine-containing bait is distributed
in the fall and spring over about 170 square miles on the mainland
side of the Cape Cod Canal. State Police provide helicopters for
spreading the pellets over half the zone, especially in sparsely
developed areas, while in the rest of the zone the bait is strewn
by hand along roadsides.

 &HT;    Bowing out with a flourish, Bonnie flogs Virginia coast
 &HT;    By Marlon Manuel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIRGINIA BEACH, VA. _ John Fuller could talk only as long as his
cigarette lasted Friday afternoon, then it was back to work. The
chief engineer at the Holiday Inn on Atlantic Avenue, Fuller had to
deal with a torn roof and sea-soaked rooms, thanks to a
surprisingly powerful visit from Hurricane Bonnie, the storm that
just wouldn't quit.
</P>
<P>
   ``You couldn't see anything. It was just sheets of rain between
the buildings,'' Fuller said, describing Thursday's late night
re-emergence by Bonnie.
</P>
<P>
   The storm had been downgraded to a tropical storm after smacking
North Carolina's Outer Banks earlier Thursday but, refusing
demotion, bashed the Hampton Roads area with an unexpected punch
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Gusts in Virginia from Bonnie hit 80-90 mph. The name on the
marquee of the The Oceanfront Inn was reduced to ``nt Inn.'' A
jagged shard of plastic and a gaping hole were all that was left of
the part of the sign that displayed ``The Oceanfro.''
</P>
<P>
   Winds late Thursday pushed a tidal surge over the beach
boardwalk in places flooding some hotel rooms and lobbies. Bits of
sand, seaweed and gravel were strewn along Atlantic Avenue,
adjacent to the beach.
</P>
<P>
   The wind also snapped mooring lines holding two ships to piers
in Norfolk. One ship broke free, but tugs were able to secure both
ships back in their berths
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to North Carolinians, who evacuated coastal areas
Tuesday and said Bonnie was more bluster than bite, residents of
southeastern Virginia felt lulled into security.
</P>
<P>
   ``People let their guard down,'' said contractor Chuck Arthur,
supervising a 65-ton crane used to lift pavers up to the Holiday
Inn's damaged rubber roof. ``I believe everybody was surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   But not disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   Her Sony Handycam rolling, Maria Boyd captured every moment of
Friday's aftermath: gray overcast, thundering surf, damaged
buildings, 30-mph winds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was up all night. I love this weather,'' said Boyd. Standing
on the boardwalk Thursday night ``was like being in a tornado,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Boyd's mother-in-law is named Bonnie, whom she compared to the
storm: ``You never know what she's going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonnie also surprised some inland residents of eastern North
Carolina, who waited and waited before finally getting walloped
late Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wondered, Where is it?'' said Will Starman, a boat salesman
from Camden, N.C., in the northeastern corner of the state. ``There
was absolutely nothing happening. And then all of a sudden, it hit.
And when it did, the rain fell in two or three different
directions. It was weird.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Starman couldn't take his normal work route to the
Edenton Marina on the Albemarle Sound because water blocked a
causeway in Elizabeth City.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were of the opinion that it was going to hit us dead on _
and then it stalled,'' Starman said.

   Tree branches and leaves on U.S. 17 from North Carolina into
Virginia increased in frequency to the north. In Chesapeake, Va.,
police directed traffic on highways where electrical outages killed
traffic lights.
</P>
<P>
   The Virginia Beach visitors center operated Friday in the dark
without power. The only clue that it was open was a box of maps
that held the glass doors ajar. Attendant Reggie Stevenson said the
handful of tourists who came in were curious. ``People are
interested to see what Bonnie has done,'' he said. ``They do
understand the circumstances, that there's going to be some
limitations.''
</P>
<P>
   Tourists made the best of it. When power went out at the
oceanfront Holiday Inn at 7 p.m. Thursday, guests gathered in the
lobby where a generator kept lights aglow.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were in good spirits,'' said Fuller, the hotel engineer.
``They had a hurricane party, drinking beer and wine.''
</P>
<P>
   By 2 p.m. Friday, the overcast cleared, the winds slacked off
and a hot sun beat down on the beach. There are more than 140
hotels on the beach with 11,000 rooms, and even though evacuations
were only voluntary, the storm threat reduced reservations by at
least 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But one of the first places to get power back was the beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the city's money here,'' said Fuller, motioning his
cigarette toward the hubbub of hotels and restaurants on Atlantic
Avenue. ``They watch out for the oceanfront.''

COMMENTARY: BEWARE THE IDES OF AUGUST 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Which do you think is scarier? Is it that Scott Ritter, the top
U.N. weapons inspector in Iraq, quit his job, accusing the United
States and the United Nations of surrendering to Saddam Hussein? Or
is it the story told by Russian economists about a Russian soldier
behind the Urals who drove his army tank to City Hall to demand
months of back pay? The soldier said he drove the tank not because
he wanted to blow up the municipality but because he didn't have
any other way to get there and couldn't afford cab fare. Or is it
reading The Washington Post, where a State Department spokesman,
James Foley, was quoted as saying that Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright couldn't possibly be going soft on Iraq because, after
all, ``Saddam Hussein has called Secretary Albright a snake and a
witch, among other things''?
</P>
<P>
   What these disturbing stories suggest is that the basic pillars
that have stabilized the post-Cold War world are all either shaking
or crumbling. And that's scary.
</P>
<P>
   Pillar No. 1 was the notion that Russia had made an irreversible
leap from communism to free-market capitalism, that it was
basically on the right track, albeit bumpy, that Boris Yeltsin was
basically the right man for the job, and that a little U.S., German
and International Monetary Fund money could grease the way.
</P>
<P>
   Today, financial experts are at a loss as to how to deal with
Russia, whose future is anything but certain. Russia's crisis is
primarily a governing crisis. Russia lacks the institutions to
properly manage a modern economy linked to today's fast-paced
global market, and the legitimacy of free markets there is still
shallow. If Russia goes bad, it's going go really fast, and if it
gets better, it's going to take a really long time.
</P>
<P>
   The second pillar was America's defeat of Saddam in the Gulf
War. That defeat resonated around the world. Those who supported
Saddam, like Yasser Arafat, had to literally apologize to their
neighbors after the war. Those who went on supporting him looked
like fools, tilting against a Pax Americana. Arab moderation
spurred Israeli moderation. But today the Arab center, not just the
extremes, is again reconciling with Saddam. The Clinton team says
it has no allies anymore to confront Saddam and no domestic
support, and it's right. But neither did George Bush when he built
the anti-Iraq coalition.
</P>
<P>
   The third pillar was the American economic model _ that liberal,
open, deregulated markets, with lots of free trade, would produce
steadily rising stock markets around the world. That model is now
facing its biggest challenge across the globe today, where
investors and workers in every emerging market are discovering that
while the American model may be the best thing going, it is much
more difficult to reproduce than first thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``American credibility is being tested in every one of these
areas,'' notes Robert Hormats, vice chairman of Goldman Sachs
International, ``and the stability of the world will depend, in
part, on whether we pass that test.''
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to the fourth shaky pillar, the leaders who made
this post-Cold War world. They are vanishing: Yitzhak Rabin was
shot. Bill Clinton shot himself. Boris Yeltsin lost his way. Helmut
Kohl lost his mandate. Japan is home alone. Who would have
predicted that today's most stable leaders would be China's
president, Jiang Zemin, and its prime minister, Zhu Rongji?
</P>
<P>
   America is a superpower, but it's not omnipotent. It needs to
decide where it can make a difference, where it can only coach and
where it is just copping out. In Iraq, it is just copping out. In
Asia the United States can make a difference by encouraging
governments there to broaden their social safety nets to catch some
of those brutalized and unemployed by the latest economic
meltdowns, so this transition to real free-market capitalism is not
derailed. In Russia, the United States, Germany and the IMF can
offer aid, but only if the Communist-led Duma passes all the
necessary reforms and Russia's greedy capitalist oligarchs are
broken.
</P>
<P>
   It's ironic: A strong Russia under Stalin could never bring the
West to heel, but a weak Russia under capitalism can, if the West
doesn't insulate itself. Which is why Bill Clinton needs to right
himself fast, so that he is not just occupying the presidency but
exercising it. America needs a president. The world needs one even
more.
</P>
<P>
   Dear reader, this is my last regular column until January. I am
taking a four-month sabbatical to finish a book about the post-Cold
War world.

INVESTORS SEEK SAFE HAVEN IN MARKET SCARE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOANN MULLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The phone on investment adviser Susan Kaplan's desk has been
ringing off the hook amid this week's scary plunge in stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   But Kaplan's clients aren't directing her to unload their shares
while they're still worth something. Instead, they're forking over
more money, telling her to buy, buy, buy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been an avalanche of people with new money who want to
invest in stocks they couldn't afford before,'' said Kaplan,
president of Kaplan Financial Services in Wellesley, Mass.
``They're saying, `I want to buy Microsoft, or I want to buy Intel,
so put the money in my account and when you think things have
settled down, buy it for me.'''
</P>
<P>
   This week's stock market drop, while admittedly nerve-wracking,
is actually a great buying opportunity, even for the most skittish
of investors, say financial planners.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think of it this way: stocks are on sale now,'' said Roy
Komack, president of Komack Management Services Inc. of Natick.
</P>
<P>
   But such advice only works if you've got extra cash lying
around. If you don't, financial planners say there are still things
you can do to minimize your losses in today's volatile market
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Unless you need cash soon _ say, for a downpayment on a house in
the next year or two _ the best advice is to sit tight, planners
agree. Playing the stock market is a long-term investment strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst thing people can do, when things get scary enough
and the markets have been down for a while, is to sell and put
their money in the bank,'' Komack said.
</P>
<P>
   That's because often the stock market rebounds as quickly as it
tanked.
</P>
<P>
   ``People tend to get out too late, but much worse, they tend to
get back in too late, too,'' agreed Kaplan.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason to stay in the stock market, some advisers say,
is that most of the logical investment alternatives _ bonds or
money market accounts _ aren't as attractive as they were during
previous stock market downturns because interest rates have
remained relatively low.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to escape the market, will you logically put
your money into something that's not going to grow more than 5 1/2
percent?'' said Robert Siefert, a principal at Back Bay Financial
Group Inc.
</P>
<P>
   But that decision depends on whether you believe interest rates
will fall further. That's because bond prices are tied to
interest-rate fluctuations.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike a stock, which represents ownership in a company, a bond
is an IOU _ a promise from a government or corporation to repay
money borrowed from the investor at a particular interest rate over
a specified period of time.
</P>
<P>
   If, sometime down the road, a bond is paying more interest than
generally available elsewhere, investors will be willing to pay
more to own it. But if the bond is paying less than prevailing
interest rates, investors will typically put their money elsewhere,
and the price of the bond sinks.
</P>
<P>
   Pran Tiku, president of Peak Financial Management in Wellesley,
is among those who think interest rates will fall soon. So he's
recommending that investors who are nervous about staying in the
stock market buy bonds instead, particularly three- to five-year US
Treasury bonds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very bullish on bonds,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If you do decide to ride out the stock market, Siefert suggests
you use the downturn as an opportunity rebalance your portfolio of
stocks and mutual funds in accordance with your original investment
goals.
</P>
<P>
   That's fairly straight-forward advice for people who own
retirement accounts, because there aren't any tax implications. Now
is the time, for instance, Siefert said, to load up on stocks in
categories that have been hard-hit by the recent volatility, such
as small US companies and those in emerging foreign markets, which
he believes are still valid investments.
</P>
<P>
   It's a little trickier, Siefert said, for investors who own
taxable portfolios. But investors would be wise to sell those
stocks or mutual funds that are now worth less than when they
bought them, so they can lock in a tax loss on the investment for
the year. But instead of parking the proceeds of the sale in a bank
until the market recovers, they should plow the money back into a
comparable small company fund that's bargain-priced, Siefert said.
</P>
<P>
   With this strategy, investors can take advantage of a tax
benefit, without losing the opportunity to ride the stock market
back up.
</P>
<P>
   People who rely on cash distributions from their investments for
living expenses should also think twice about selling shares to
replenish the cash balances in their portfolios, Siefert warned.
That's because they would be selling into a depressed market and
wouldn't get the same return they might otherwise get if they
waited for the market to rebound.
</P>
<P>
   The only good reason for getting out of the stock market now,
said Kaplan, is if your financial goals have changed.
</P>
<P>
   If you've decided to retire early, for instance, you'll need a
steady stream of income now, so the stock market is not a good
place to have your money, she said. Likewise, if your son-in-law
loses his job and you want to help support your daughter's family,
you also have a greater need for income.
</P>
<P>
   But fear of what the market is going to do next week shouldn't
alter the behavior of long-term investors, Kaplan and other
financial advisers agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Said Tiku, ``If you pick good stocks and hang onto them, there's
a very good opportunity for you to do well in the next three to
five years.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The only way Dunstan Connell could have been more emphatic would
have been if he had borrowed Alfred E. Neuman's shibboleth from Mad
magazine: ``What, me worry?''
</P>
<P>
   ``This?'' Connell, a clerk for Charles Schwab &AMP; Co. who works at
the New York Stock Exchange, said as the Dow Jones industrial
average was seesawing Friday between a gain and a loss. ``It's not
a big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   He enumerated the milestones of his 15-year career. ``I was down
here for the crash,'' he said, as everyone on Wall Street refers to
Oct. 19, 1987, when the Dow plunged 508 points, or 22 percent. ``I
was down here last year,'' when the Dow fell 554.26 points, or 7.2
percent, on Oct. 27.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been through this before,'' he said. ``Even Thursday
wasn't that bad.''
</P>
<P>
   From the fashion industry's workrooms on Seventh Avenue to the
exercise bicycles in private midtown clubs to the carpeted waiting
rooms in storefront brokerage offices, New Yorkers watched as the
markets dipped and climbed and dipped again Friday. By the time the
Dow finally settled at 8051.68 _ down 114.31 points, or 1.4 percent
_ most still seemed unworried by Wall Street's sudden turn toward
bear market territory.
</P>
<P>
   Like millions of other American investors who have ridden the
stock market like a roller-coaster the last few years, investors
and stock market employees interviewed during the day acknowledged
some queasiness about where the market was headed _ if not now,
then next week. But no one seemed to be using the p-word.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see anybody panicking,'' said Dean Rasi, a clerk at
the New York Stock Exchange. ``Some brokers are having a hard time.
I hear them talking. You can hear guys go, `This is killing me,
this is killing me,' trying to rush their orders.''
</P>
<P>
   Other stock exchange workers reported hearing an unaccustomed
edginess in brokers' voices, an unfamiliar uncertainty. But many
small investors still sounded confident. Some said they had shifted
their money into cash or money market funds, but most said they
were not selling out. Not yet, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've inherited a lot of my stocks, and if you inherit blue
chips, you hang onto them,'' Anne Murphy, a costume designer, said,
smiling brightly in Bryant Park in New York City. ``I figure it's
all going to balance out. We went up so much last year, so if it
went back to where it was a year ago that wouldn't be so bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Banks, an engineer in St. Louis who specializes in
high-definition television sets, was even more upbeat. Despite the
economic meltdown in Russia and the tremors in Asia, he said the
stock market was still a healthy outpost.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not all that concerned,'' he said Friday afternoon, when
the Dow was down about 61 points. ``Right now, our economy is
strong. The rest of the world looks to us, so you have to be
careful of knee-jerk reactions.''
</P>
<P>
   Staying the course has been a motto for many small investors
throughout the long bull market of the 1990s, which many Wall
Street analysts date to October 1990. It was the small investors
who ``bought the dips.'' They went bargain-hunting. They ignored
all the noise about Asia and currency collapses. After all, last
October's 13.2 percent drop in the Dow, the worst in the 1990s, was
followed by a 30 percent rally.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard Soriano of Trenton, N.J., who gave up managing health
clubs to manage his portfolio from home, was convinced that pattern
was still intact. ``It can only go up,'' he said. ``It will go
down, but in the long term it's always gone up.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But on Friday he was selling. ``I'm in front of my computer
right now, trying to get out of stuff,'' he said. ``I'm ready to
jump off the Empire State Building, but they don't do that
anymore,'' he added with a chuckle. ``My net worth is down 50
percent in the last few weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Soriano said he was ``not trading money I need.'' He also said
he had started to put aside cash as a cushion if prices tumble more
than they already have.
</P>
<P>
   Like Soriano, millions of other investors are more attuned than
ever to the stock market's every gyration. Labor officials talk
about how even union halls have big-screen television sets tuned to
CNBC and how the buzz in the room stops as the closing bell nears.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps nothing has brought the market closer to small
investors than the Internet. Omar Wasow, who monitors online chat
rooms for MSNBC, said the chatter remained almost universally
optimistic about the market's long-term prospects.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really astonished, given the leading, critical questions
I asked, that people were not concerned,'' Wasow said. ``One person
I talked to said you've got to be in it for the long term, and that
sort of echoed the general consensus.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those in one Internet chat room Wasow plugged into was
someone identified as Crabtown, who said that baby boomers could
sustain the stock market through 2005, when boomers begin to retire
and cash in their holdings.
</P>
<P>
   Crabtown, with the characteristic bravado of the '90s investor,
predicted that the Dow would hit 15,000 before then.

MARKETS IN ASIA TUMBLE TO LOWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By INDIRA A.R. LAKSHMANAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ Panic over Wall Street's slump and nosediving
economies worldwide reverberated through Asia Friday, dragging
already depressed markets to historic lows and fueling fears of a
feedback effect on exchanges from New York to Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Leading the decline was the world's second largest economy, as
Japan's Nikkei index plunged to a 12-year low. Shares in Malaysia
and Singapore hit 10-year lows, while the Philippine stock market
closed at a 6 1/2-year bottom.
</P>
<P>
   Fending off a decline here, the Hong Kong government intervened
massively in the local market Friday, spending several billion
dollars to prop up blue-chip stocks and punish speculators who had
bet share prices would fall.
</P>
<P>
   The drastic intervention in a famously free market capped two
weeks of flurried stock buying by the government, bringing to a
crescendo a debate over whether supporting shares is beneficial or
foolhardy. Analysts Friday said the government cannot afford to
prop up the market much longer, and predicted a crashing correction
in the week or month ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to its woes, Hong Kong officially entered recession
Friday, joining other once-invincible powerhouses like Japan and
South Korea. The gross domestic product shrank for the second
consecutive quarter, this time by 5 percent _ a far cry from 5.3
percent growth last year. Economists Friday predicted Hong Kong
would not recover until 2001.
</P>
<P>
   With every major Asian market down, it was a grim day across the
region that dominated global economic growth for the last decade _
and which now is fueling market corrections worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   But it is perhaps more in Hong Kong than anywhere else in Asia
that market watchers are tensely awaiting next week's trading. The
coming days will test whether the government can prop up the market
and the Hong Kong dollar, one of the only Asian currencies that has
retained its value in the last year. If the Hong Kong dollar
devalues, it would destroy both wealth and confidence here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hong Kong has had a crash, but it's nothing like it will be if
the Hong Kong dollar or the renminbi (the Chinese currency) go. I
think we'd see worldwide panic on the back of that,'' said Edmund
Bradley, global research director at Credit Lyonnais Securities
Asia. ``The first week of September is going to be a nasty one for
global markets.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Hong Kong government stops intervening in the market,
some analysts say the index could easily lose 1,000 points in a
day, or one-eighth of its value. But if the government continues to
buy blue-chips, it could spend down its reserves too low to defend
its currency against speculative attacks _ the recipe that brought
down Thailand and Indonesia last year. Either way, the government
may have boxed itself and its beleagued economy into a corner.
</P>
<P>
   The implications for Asia and beyond are enormous. The
government intervention has angered many who credited this place as
the freest market in the world, and could scare off foreign
institutional investors. It has also prompted long-term individual
buyers to sell off shares and exit the market, a trend that could
delay recovery.
</P>
<P>
   The government buying spree _ estimated by brokers to have cost
between $6.5 billion and $15 billion in taxpayer money so far _ set
a record trading volume Friday of $10.19 billion _ almost twice the
previous record set a year ago. Friday was a key day, because
August futures contracts expired.
</P>
<P>
   The idea behind the intervention has been to chase out
speculators _investors who bet against the market _ thereby
lowering interest rates and boosting the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say the intervention would be considered manipulation
elsewhere. Defenders counter that short-selling tactics employed by
fund managers here are illegal in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Financial Secretary Donald Tsang said Friday the government is
considering measures to ``tighten up discipline in the areas of
short-selling and stock borrowing,'' fueling concerns that market
controls might be imposed.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, government officials are describing the intervention
that began Aug. 14 and reached a fever pitch Friday as ``a war''
and ``armageddon'' against speculators. But most analysts predict
the scheme will backfire.
</P>
<P>
   The government's ``goal has not been achieved in the least.
Everyone has been leaving the market except for speculators,'' said
Mac Overton, fund manager for MBf Unit Trust Management in Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
   A number of countries, including the United Kingdom, Thailand,
Indonesia, Malaysia and Japan, have tried to intervene in their
markets and have failed, he said. A better use of public reserves
would have been to buy mortgages from banks, making them healthier
and better able to loan money.
</P>
<P>
   There are others who are more sympathetic to the government's
position, saying it needed to do something to prevent a collapse of
the market. The Hang Seng index had dropped nearly 60 percent in
the last year, and government buying raised the index 20 percent in
the last two weeks, saving some major companies from
balance-of-payment crises that would imperil banks.
</P>
<P>
   ``People make the mistake of thinking that a free market is the
same as a fair market,'' said Richard Verin, head of equity trading
in Asia for Credit Suisse First Boston. He said big overseas hedge
funds had taken advantage of the Hong Kong market, attacking the
currency and driving up interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   But the risk, he said, is that huge speculators may be too big
an opponent even for the government.
</P>
<P>
   Even many outspoken defenders of the government's intervention
two weeks ago had changed their tune by Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't approve of it anymore ... not of the amount of money
they have spent,'' said Jim Mellon, managing director of Regent
Pacific Group, a Hong Kong-based emerging markets fund manager.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong has $97 billion in reserves _ the second-highest in
the world after China's _ but $50 billion of that is set aside to
cover the basic money supply, since the currency is pegged to the
US dollar. Ten billion dollars will be needed to cover this year's
budget deficit, plus another $10 billion for next year's deficit,
Mellon says. He estimates the government had spent at least $6.5
billion by the end of trading Friday, leaving just $23.5 billion of
usable reserves _ a dangerously low figure. (The government has
refused to reveal how much it has spent in the market).
</P>
<P>
   In the end, he predicts, Hong Kong will lose _ not the
speculators.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hedge funds are like cockroaches,'' he said. ``You can drown
them, you can crush them, you can stamp them out. But they always
come back.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Losses, losses, who's got the losses?
</P>
<P>
   That is the parlor game for investors and traders as they try to
plumb the damage sustained by American financial institutions from
the mess in Russia. That nation's devaluation and de facto default
on its debt Tuesday roiled markets worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   While a few domestic banks came clean late last week about their
Russian exposure _ Republic New York with a $110 million loss,
BankAmerica with $220 million and BankBoston with $10 million _ the
silence from many other financial institutions is deafening.
</P>
<P>
   Does that mean that it's safe to go back into the water and
scoop up some of battered financial services stocks? No way.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble with the increasingly complex financial transactions
that have become routine at banks around the world today is that
when disaster strikes, it takes an inordinate amount of time to
track down whether the institution on the other side of the trade
is still standing, let alone solvent. If history is any guide,
complete information about these transactions may not trickle out
for months.
</P>
<P>
   This is not what investors have come to expect in a wired world.
But it happened with the losses taken by banks in Asia following
the devaluation of the Thai baht in July 1997 and is likely to
happen again after the Russia disaster. ``The disclosures started
coming in Southeast Asia in third-quarter earnings reports and
fourth-quarter regulatory filings,'' said Paul Spraos, publisher of
Swaps Monitor, a derivatives industry newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   Among the stickiest parts of this mess are billions of dollars
in foreign currency transactions entered into by Western banks and
hedge funds with Russian banks. As these hedge funds bought
ruble-denominated Russian bonds, they needed to offset their risk
that the ruble might fall. So when they bought their bonds, they
sold contracts covering an equivalent amount of rubles and maturing
when their bonds did. That way they bore no currency risk while
awaiting return of their principal. Or so they thought.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 17, the Russian Central Bank announced a 90-day
moratorium on all payments due from Russian banks; included were an
estimated $50 billion owed on foreign currency contracts, called
forwards. Many of the Russian banks on the other side of the
currency trades are not expected to reopen after the freeze.
</P>
<P>
   Combine this with the radical restructuring of Russian debt, in
which investors are getting roughly 10 cents on the dollar for
their holdings, and the losses begin to pile up. Hedge funds, which
borrowed money to buy debt, were the biggest losers.
</P>
<P>
   Don't cry for these guys. They are hardened speculators known
for big gambles.
</P>
<P>
   What is amazing is that banks, which should know how to conduct
due diligence on institutions they do business with, were willing
to enter into contracts with dubious Russian banks. Many are not
much more than piggy banks for the Russian organizations they are a
part of. National Reserve Bank, for instance, is linked with
Gazprom, the big natural-gas producer.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I heard investors were trying to hedge with Russian
banks, I thought they were off their rockers,'' said David Riley, a
director at Fitch IBCA, a credit-rating agency in London. ``The
first-tier banks are dreadful and the second tier, awful.'' When
this is over, he predicted, ``a forward with a Russian bank won't
be worth the paper it's printed on.''

   RUSSIA: The Ruble Takes a Beating
</P>
<P>
   With Russia's economy shaken after the government suspended debt
payments, and President Boris Yeltsin under pressure to cede some
of his powers, investors were quick to sell Russian shares and try
to exchange rubles for stronger currencies. As a result, the
central bank suspended foreign-exchange trading Thursday. A
security officer posted a notice at an exchange office in Moscow.

   MARKETS: A Global Unraveling
</P>
<P>
   Stock market investors around the world rushed to sell,
frightened by economic problems in Russia and Asia. Thursday, the
worst trading day of the year, the Dow Jones industrial average
fell 4.19 percent, or 357.36 points, to close at 8,165.99, some
12.5 percent below its July 17 high of 9,337.97. Investors are well
into what Wall Street calls a correction. And a bear market _
defined as a price decline of 15 to 20 percent _ appeared to be at
hand. The Dow ended the week at 8,01.68, down 481.97 points, and
the Nasdaq composite fell 157.93 points, to 1,639.68. The rate on
the 30-year Treasury bond fell to 5.34 percent, the lowest
long-term yield in three decades.

   MICROSOFT: Was Intel Bullied?
</P>
<P>
   In its continuing antitrust investigation of Microsoft, the
government is looking into whether the company used its market
muscle to force Intel, its only real peer, to shelve new-technology
efforts that conflicted with Microsoft's ambitions. Federal and
state investigators were said to have taken depositions from key
Intel employees, including chairman Andrew Grove, left. Microsoft
contends that the investigators are trying to portray routine
business meetings as attempts to forge an anti-competitive
conspiracy.

</P>
<P>
   British Airways, long loyal to Boeing, ordered as many as 188
short-haul, single-aisle jets worth $8.5 billion from Boeing's
rival, Airbus Industrie, the European aircraft consortium. The
order is expected to assure 38,000 British jobs at factories of
Rolls-Royce PLC, the jet engine maker, and British Aerospace, one
of the four partners in the Airbus group. British Airways, Europe's
largest carrier, also announced that it would buy 16 new Boeing
777-200 jets, with an option for 16 more, for a total of $4.8
billion, but said that it was canceling previous orders for 5 of 15
larger and more expensive Boeing 747-400s, as well as options on 7
others.

   GOLDMAN, SACHS: A Money Machine
</P>
<P>
   Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co., officially registering to end its
partnership and go public in November, confirmed what Wall Street
had long known: It is obsessively secretive and phenomenally
profitable. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, the firm disclosed that earnings had grown at a 15
percent compound annual growth rate over 15 years, to $3 billion in
1997. It also reported a pretax return on partners' capital that
exceeded 60 percent in its best years. But the firm was vague on
what it intended to do with the capital it raises _ it is earmarked
for ``general corporate purposes'' _ and left many blanks in its
prospectus, presumably to be filled in at the last possible moment
in October.

   Venturing into a field littered with failure, Hicks, Muse, Tate
&AMP; Furst, the leveraged-buyout firm in Dallas, agreed to pay $250
million for a 62 percent stake in Coho Energy, an oil exploration
and production company. The deal, while modest, signals a bet that
the long-suffering oil industry is ready for a comeback. Another
indication came at the latest federal auction of offshore oil
leases in the western Gulf of Mexico. The average high bid, $1.37
million, was sharply higher than the $766,417 average of a year
earlier. A rig for Shell Oil is towed into place in the Gulf.

   THE ECONOMY: Persistent Strength
</P>
<P>
   Despite a strike against General Motors and a slowing of exports
to Asia, the economy grew at a faster-than-expected annual rate of
1.6 percent in the second quarter, the Commerce Department
reported. That was still well below the 5.5 percent growth rate of
the first quarter. . . . Orders for durable goods unexpectedly rose
a healthy 2.4 percent in July, the department said. . . . Consumer
confidence slipped in August, the Conference Board reported, to an
index reading of 133.1, down from 137.2 in July. The 30-year peak
was 138.2, reached in June.
</P>
<P>
   LAYOFFS: More Pink Slips
</P>
<P>
   For workers at several companies, however, the economy does not
look so healthy. Northrop Grumman said it planned to reduce its
work force by 8,000 people, or 15 percent, by the end of 2000 to
remain an independent and competitive aerospace company. . . .
Harnischfeger Industries, reporting a wider-than-expected quarterly
loss, said it would eliminate about 3,100 jobs, or 20 percent of
its workers, because of a glut of paper and weakening demand. . . .
Applied Materials, citing a downturn in the global semiconductor
industry, said it would cut 2,000 jobs, or 15 percent of its work
force, mostly in Santa Clara, Calif., and Austin, Texas, and would
shave executive salaries by 10 percent.

said, describing the trivial role that, she contended, Hoechst's

precarious finances. The $2 million settlement stemmed from one of
a long-running series of legal actions that arose from the firm's
dual role as underwriter and investment adviser to the county. . .
. A federal judge ordered Trans Union Corp., one of the nation's
largest credit bureaus, to stop selling detailed credit information
about consumers to advertisers and marketers without the subjects'
consent. The company said it would appeal. . . . Merck and its
Merck-Medco Managed Care unit agreed with the FTC to bar Medco from
discriminating against drugs made by Merck's competitors.

NEW TOOL TO HELP WOMEN IN 40S WEIGH MAMMOGRAM RISK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Women in their 40s confused by the bitter and complex debate
over the value of routine mammograms for their age group were given
a new tool Friday to calculate their personal cancer risk and guide
them toward a decision.
</P>
<P>
   The tool is a formula for determining whether a 40-something
woman has a high enough risk of breast cancer to justify undergoing
the screening X-rays yearly in an effort to detect tumors early.
</P>
<P>
   In general, women in their 40s have a very low risk of breast
cancer _ though the risk grows steeply over the course of that
decade.
</P>
<P>
   The new method, devised by National Cancer Institute scientists,
is the first to provide women in this age group and their doctors
with a relatively simple scheme for sorting through the welter of
confusing factors that weigh for or against routine mammography.
</P>
<P>
   Although many women and their doctors currently try to think
through these factors on their own, the new tool should help
clarify the decision ``for the large proportion of women who either
underestimate or overestimate their risk,'' said an NCI statement.
</P>
<P>
   Several major health organizations and agencies now favor
routine breast X-rays for women aged 40-49, and many women feel
strongly they want the screening. But some groups continue to argue
the small number of cancers detected early doesn't justify the
costs and the frequent ``false-positive'' results leading to
unnecessary further exams, surgical biopsies, anxiety and cost.
</P>
<P>
   The process designed by Dr. Mitchell Gail and Barbara Rimer of
the NCI is aimed at singling out those women in their 40s who,
because of their medical history and other risk factors, have at
least as much chance of developing breast cancer as a woman in her
50s with no other risk factors. By age 50, there's no dispute that
all women are at high enough risk to warrant annual mammograms.
</P>
<P>
   In a paper published in the current issue of the Journal of
Clinical Oncology, the authors say that following their scheme
would lead to an estimated 10 percent of white women age 40
undergoing yearly screening. The proportion would rise to 95
percent at age 49. For black women, it would be 16 percent at age
40 and 95 percent at age 49.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't disagree with general recommendations that screening
is beneficial for women in their 40s,'' said Gail, an NCI
biostatistician, in a telephone interview. ``But I think this may
be helpful in allowing women to put their own risks into
perspective and relate them to those of women for whom there's no
doubt'' that routine mammography pays off, by catching breast
cancers at an early, treatable stage.
</P>
<P>
   The NCI and the American Cancer Society have endorsed yearly
screening for women in their 40s. However, a panel sponsored by the
National Institutes of health concluded in 1997 that the data from
a number of studies ``did not warrant a single recommendation for
all women in their 40s.'' Nor has the US Preventive Services Task
Force, a panel reporting to the Department of Health and Human
Services, recommended routine mammograms at that age.
</P>
<P>
   A physician at Harvard Vanguard Medical Associates who is not in
favor of mammograms for all women in their 40s hailed the
development of the risk-assessment method.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any method that helps clarify clinical risk to patients will
help patients make better decisions for themselves,'' said Dr. Mary
Burton, an internist at the group's Copley Center. She said Harvard
Vanguard recommends a mammogram every two years for women in their
40s.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Eric Winer, director of the breast oncology center at
Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, called the paper ``very
interesting'' and helpful because it highlights the fact that ``all
40-to-49-year-old women are not alike'' in their cancer risk.
</P>
<P>
   But Winer questioned whether the method would become widely
used. For one thing, he said, ``there's still an incredible amount
of emotion involved in this issue'' that could sway many women,
regardless of the outcome of a more-rationally based method for
decision making.
</P>
<P>
   The paper offers two versions of the method. One, the
``exact-age procedure,'' relies on a table giving a risk value for
each year of age between 40 and 50. The other ``grouped-age
procedure'' provides one flow chart for women 40-44 and a second
for women 45-49.
</P>
<P>
   In either case, a woman first checks a table of ``strong'' risk
factors, any one of which should prompt regular screening. The six
risk factors are: previous breast cancer; having a breast cancer
gene such as BRCA1 or BRCA2; a mother, sister or daughter with
breast cancer history; atypical hyperplasia (abnormal cells) found
in a previous biopsy; 75 percent or more dense breast tissue on a
mammogram if the woman is 45-49 years; two or more breast biopsies
in the past, even if no cancer was found.
</P>
<P>
   If she has none of these risk factors, the woman turns to a
table of weaker one _ her age when she began menstruating, the
number of previous biopsies (zero or one), and her age when first
gave birth, if she has children. The values from this table,
combined with her age, yield the woman's risk of developing breast
cancer in the next year relative to the risk of a 50-year-old woman
with no risk factors.
</P>
<P>
   Gail acknowledged that some women are willing to accept a lot of
inconvenience, anxiety and needless followup procedures for even a
small chance of catching a tumor early. ``A lot depends on the
particular values and mindset of the woman, and ths (the formula)
is just one part of the individual's decision,'' he said.

DESPITE RUMORS, DEFIANT YELTSIN SAYS HE WILL NOT RESIGN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to expand)   (See related: RUSSIA-YELTSIN, RUSSIA-U.S., RUSSIA-U.S.-SUMMIT)  
(mk) 
 By MICHAEL WINES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Boris Yeltsin, reclaiming a bit of his old defiant
nature, insisted on national television Friday night that he would
serve out his term as Russia's president and that, for him,
resignation was impossible.
</P>
<P>
   But rumors and reality alike suggested Friday that his
presidency, if it does last, is rushing toward figurehead status.
</P>
<P>
   In excerpts from an interview broadcast on the RTP television
network, Yeltsin cast himself as once again in command of his
nation's increasingly desperate financial situation. He said new
instructions given to the Central Bank and the government ``spelled
out in detail what should be done'' and would be strictly obeyed.
And he took pains to portray the country's new prime minister,
Victor Chernomyrdin, as a subordinate and not a pretender to his
throne.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has been given as much power as he is entitled to as a
prime minister in any developed country,'' Yeltsin said. ``This was
given to back up strategic tasks. So, consult the president. All
the rest _ you have a free hand. Take decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   But even before he spoke _ slowly, with stilted speech and
almost painful pauses _ his envoy to the powerful Communist bloc in
Russia's lower house of Parliament, the Duma, said Yeltsin had
already agreed to cede key portions of the almost-dictatorial
powers of the Russian presidency.
</P>
<P>
   The president's representative to the Duma, Alexander Kotenkov,
and the Communist Duma speaker, Gennady Seleznyov, said in a news
conference that they had reached broad agreement on a new economic
policy and on changes to the 1993 constitution that is the
foundation of presidential power.
</P>
<P>
   Kotenkov said Yeltsin has agreed to allow the prime minister _
that is, Chernomyrdin _ to name Cabinet ministers and to give the
parliament the right to reject those appointments. Yeltsin also
agreed that Chernomyrdin's government should be given a year's
grace period in which it would be spared political attack, Kotenkov
said.
</P>
<P>
   Either concession would mark a sea change in the generally
autocratic but free-market political ideology that has kept Yeltsin
in power for seven years now. Any serious alliance with the
Communists, who want to re-nationalize industry, increase social
spending and re-establish control of the economy, should be
anathema to western governments and investors who had begun to
build a market economy here.
</P>
<P>
   None of that is to say that Yeltsin or future presidents would
not remain powerful. The president would, among many other things,
choose the prime minister, set economic and defense policy and
remain the nation's representative to the world.
</P>
<P>
   But a consensus has emerged _ true or not _ that Yeltsin is no
longer in control of his fate, or that of his nation. And there
seems to be growing agreement, even among the country's squabbling
political barons, that Chernomyrdin is just about all that stands
between Mother Russia and the abyss.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin effectively said Friday night that that is baloney. ``It
is impossible to remove me, especially considering my character,''
he said in the interview. ``I will not go anywhere. I will not
resign. I will work as long as the constitution allows. Elections
for a new Parliament will be held in the year 2000, but I will not
take part in them.''
</P>
<P>
   Notwithstanding his denial, speculation continues to mushroom
that Yeltsin is seriously ill and soon will resign _ perhaps next
week, if the Duma confirms Chernomyrdin as prime minister _ and
that his maneuverings on television are aimed mostly at persuading
the Duma to do just that.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't believe his words,'' Leonid Radzikhovsky, political
columnist for the Moscow daily Segodnya, said in an interview after
Friday night's speech. ``More precisely, I think Yeltsin in his
character wants to hang on until the last second, but he's already
not together. And to take the place of Yeltsin, you need
Chernomyrdin.''
</P>
<P>
   The president's wan countenance and his wooden mannerisms do
little to discourage such speculation. Nor do real-life political
events.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, in a meeting with Yeltsin, two of Chernomyrdin's leading
rivals in the next presidential election _ Moscow's mayor, Yuri
Luzhkov, and Yegor Stroyev, the chairman of the upper house of
Parliament _ endorsed Chernomyrdin's accession to power. So did
Alexander Lebed, the charismatic army general who now is governor
in Russia's Siberian region and Luzhkov's principal opponent in the
early handicapping of the next presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   Such unity is unheard of among Russian presidential political
rivals. But one western investor, who refused to be identified,
surmised Friday night that they decided that they and the nation
had little choice. ``Read the history of the Weimar republic,'' he
said. ``I think they should be scared.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether Russia will again endure the sort of hyperinflation that
rent post-World War I Germany is pure speculation, but signs of
economic turmoil are everywhere. Russian stocks sank another 10 per
cent and more, but on such low volume that the decline was almost
meaningless. By one estimate, the value of all corporate stocks on
the Russian stock market has now dropped almost sevenfold this
year, to a paltry $15.9 billion _ roughly that of Caterpillar
Corp., the Peoria, Ill., bulldozer maker.
</P>
<P>
   The ruble briefly traded on electronic markets Friday at a rate
of almost 13 to the dollar _ more than double two weeks ago _ and
in the few street shops that sold dollars, the rate was even
higher. Lines, albeit orderly ones, queued outside many Moscow
banks Friday, and some stores reported panic buying by consumers
who anticipated _ accurately _ that prices were about to skyrocket.
</P>
<P>
   Some Russian stores shut altogether, unable to figure out what
their goods were worth when the ruble's value was proving almost
impossible to accurately measure. Other companies in Moscow
abandoned ruble pricing altogether to value their goods in an
unnamed currency whose value could be measured against the American
dollar. Charles Blitzer, a former World Bank official who now
assesses emerging markets in London for Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP;
Jenrette, said the crucial job of the new Russian government is to
stop the ruble's free-fall.
</P>
<P>
   ''Given their financial position, that's going to mean cutting
demand for dollars, either for luxury goods or with stronger
measures to force repatriation of export earnings,'' he said.
``That's an absolute must in stopping the panic.''
</P>
<P>
   Blitzer said the government cannot dawdle if it is to save
itself, and the nation, from fiscal chaos and the prospect of
shortages and social unrest. ''We're in a situation where, really,
a month is a long time,'' he said.

ANOTHER DAY OF UNCERTAINTY FOR EUROPEAN MARKETS 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also MARKET, JAPAN-ECON, HONGKONG-ECON) 
(mk) 
 By JOHN TAGLIABUE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ The economic uncertainty in Russia and its reverberations
in emerging markets around the globe continued to rattle European
stock markets Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The only gains in Europe appeared to come from traders vacating
short positions for the weekend. In shorting a stock, traders
borrow shares from a broker for a fee and sell them. They hope to
replace the shares by buying them at a lower price and pocketing
the difference as profit.
</P>
<P>
   Indexes in the region fell about 2 percent after rallying from
sharp drops of up to 5 percent earlier in the day. The London Stock
Exchange, Europe's largest, led the downward slide, plummeting 2.2
percent to a seven-month low, while Frankfurt closed down 1.7
percent after suffering losses of up to 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Fledgling stock markets in Eastern Europe were also swept by a
wave of selling as the uncertainty in Russia cast a shadow over the
prospects of businesses in Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic
that continue to trade with Russia; food-processing and
pharmaceutical companies were particularly hard hit. The Prague
exchange lost ground, and stock indexes in Warsaw and Budapest fell
to their lowest level since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In Spain, the plummet in share prices showed the effects of
collapsing stock prices in Latin America, where Spanish banks and
corporations have invested heavily in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The Madrid exchange closed down 2.3 percent, pushing Spanish
share prices to a weekly decline of almost 20 percent as investors
fled companies that they feared were particularly exposed in Latin
America, including banks like Banco Santander and Banco Bilbao
Vizcaya, but also the telecommunications giant Telefonica.
</P>
<P>
   Aysha Zaman, European equity strategist at BT Alex. Brown in
London, said the main forces behind the European selloff were
inflated share prices, which in late July were averaging about 22
times earnings, and unrealistic expectations for growth, given the
uncertainties of the Asian and Russian crises.
</P>
<P>
   The deepening crisis in Russia is accelerating the tailspin.
</P>
<P>
   While the first phase of Europe's adjustment in early August hit
banks and corporations exposed to Asia, like Paribas and Societe
Generale of France, the financial turmoil in Russia is determining
which shares are being hurt now. In Germany, the big losers have
been Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank and automakers like
Volkswagen.
</P>
<P>
   Swiss banks with Russian exposure, like Credit Suisse, have also
suffered, but so has UBS, despite its limited exposure in Eastern
Europe; UBS became Europe's largest bank last year after the merger
of Union Bank of Switzerland and Swiss Bank Corp. By contrast,
German chemical companies like Bayer AG and Henkel, which had steep
drops in their share prices earlier in the week, benefited from a
wave of buying Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The effects of lowered growth expectations were felt in Britain,
where a recent surge in the value of the pound added to concerns
about the outlook for export-oriented companies, like GKN PLC, the
maker of helicopters and auto parts; the shares of GKN plummeted
more than 6 percent Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts said that as long as hedge funds and other money
managers who have big losses in places like Russia continued
selling to raise cash, a general liquidity tightness would cause
European exchanges to slide even further.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Zaman said the current selloff might be stopped, or at least
slowed, if major central banks like the U.S. Federal Reserve or the
Bundesbank took steps to increase market liquidity. Even that,
however, would have only a temporary staying effect, she said, at
least until it becomes clear what long-range effects for European
economies the crises in Russia and East Asia will bring.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very bearish,'' she said. ``We expect the adjustment
will go further.''

EUROPEAN POWERS TELL RUSSIA TO GET TOUGH ON ECONOMY
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ The finance ministers of four economically powerful
Western European countries warned Moscow on Friday that the only
way out of its current crisis was to make the tough economic
changes long urged by the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   A letter by the four ministers _ from Germany, France, Italy and
Britain _ to acting Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin said
those steps included enforcement of tax laws that were widely
ignored and a monetary policy aimed at keeping inflation in check.
</P>
<P>
   None of the countries offered Russia any emergency assistance,
emphasizing instead that the IMF would be the lead agency for
dealing with the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The letter from the four European members of the Group of Seven,
the world's leading industrial democracies, was part of a concerted
European effort to urge Chernomyrdin not to give in to pressure
from the Communist opposition in Russia and drop unpopular economic
programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``A return of confidence in financial markets will be possible
only if Russia proceeds with its reform program in close
relationship with the International Monetary Fund,'' a statement on
the letter issued by the French Finance Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain spoke on Thursday with
President Clinton, who plans to visit Russia next week, and
officials in London said they had agreed on what Russia needed to
do.
</P>
<P>
   ``The program and plan that has been put together over a long
period of time by the international institutions does genuinely
offer the only way out of this,'' Blair said during a visit to
Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   A high-ranking French official, however, said that the
U.S.-Russian summit would probably be ``useless.'' Clinton is so
weakened by the admission of having had an intimate relationship
with a White House intern and Yeltsin is so stricken by Russia's
economic and political turmoil that neither seems able to agree on
a solution to the crisis, said the official, who refused to be
identified.
</P>
<P>
   German Finance Minister Theo Waigel said in Munich, ``Russia
needs, like any other country, to work closely with international
financial institutions, but Russia must solve its own problems.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that Germany and France would work together to try to
help, but stressed that aid to Moscow from Germany, which has
already lent or donated tens of billions of dollars in gratitude
for Russia's agreement to its unification in 1990, was ``out of the
question.''
</P>
<P>
   As news accounts from Russia indicated that Chernomyrdin might
be preparing to strengthen state control of the economy and let
inflation run, authorities in Bonn and Paris expressed continuing
concern about economic and political developments in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   ``The finance ministers agree it is vital to strengthen the
foundations of public finances with a fair tax system and to adopt
measures to restore the stability of the financial system,'' the
German Finance Ministry said. ``It is also decisive that the
Russian central bank is able to pursue an independent,
stability-oriented monetary policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Waigel told the German financial daily Handelsblatt: ``Turning
up the printing presses is never a wise solution. Inflation is no
way to escape the financial crisis. There is no way around rapid
implementation of structural reforms.''
</P>
<P>
   French Finance Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn said: ``It is
clear that the solution is in the hands of the Russian government.
We appreciate that financial assistance from us is necessary, but
not sufficient. In particular, the Russian government has to put
fiscal reforms in place.''

MARKETS IN ASIA TUMBLE TO LOWS

<P>
   HONG KONG _ Panic over Wall Street's slump and nosediving
economies worldwide reverberated through Asia Friday, dragging
already depressed markets to historic lows and fueling fears of a
feedback effect on exchanges from New York to Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Leading the decline was the world's second largest economy, as
Japan's Nikkei index plunged to a 12-year low. Shares in Malaysia
and Singapore hit 10-year lows, while the Philippine stock market
closed at a 6 1/2-year bottom.
</P>
<P>
   Fending off a decline here, the Hong Kong government intervened
massively in the local market Friday, spending several billion
dollars to prop up blue-chip stocks and punish speculators who had
bet share prices would fall.
</P>
<P>
   The drastic intervention in a famously free market capped two
weeks of flurried stock buying by the government, bringing to a
crescendo a debate over whether supporting shares is beneficial or
foolhardy. Analysts Friday said the government cannot afford to
prop up the market much longer, and predicted a crashing correction
in the week or month ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to its woes, Hong Kong officially entered recession
Friday, joining other once-invincible powerhouses like Japan and
South Korea. The gross domestic product shrank for the second
consecutive quarter, this time by 5 percent _ a far cry from 5.3
percent growth last year. Economists Friday predicted Hong Kong
would not recover until 2001.
</P>
<P>
   With every major Asian market down, it was a grim day across the
region that dominated global economic growth for the last decade _
and which now is fueling market corrections worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   But it is perhaps more in Hong Kong than anywhere else in Asia
that market watchers are tensely awaiting next week's trading. The
coming days will test whether the government can prop up the market
and the Hong Kong dollar, one of the only Asian currencies that has
retained its value in the last year. If the Hong Kong dollar
devalues, it would destroy both wealth and confidence here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hong Kong has had a crash, but it's nothing like it will be if
the Hong Kong dollar or the renminbi (the Chinese currency) go. I
think we'd see worldwide panic on the back of that,'' said Edmund
Bradley, global research director at Credit Lyonnais Securities
Asia. ``The first week of September is going to be a nasty one for
global markets.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Hong Kong government stops intervening in the market,
some analysts say the index could easily lose 1,000 points in a
day, or one-eighth of its value. But if the government continues to
buy blue-chips, it could spend down its reserves too low to defend
its currency against speculative attacks _ the recipe that brought
down Thailand and Indonesia last year. Either way, the government
may have boxed itself and its beleagued economy into a corner.
</P>
<P>
   The implications for Asia and beyond are enormous. The
government intervention has angered many who credited this place as
the freest market in the world, and could scare off foreign
institutional investors. It has also prompted long-term individual
buyers to sell off shares and exit the market, a trend that could
delay recovery.
</P>
<P>
   The government buying spree _ estimated by brokers to have cost
between $6.5 billion and $15 billion in taxpayer money so far _ set
a record trading volume Friday of $10.19 billion _ almost twice the
previous record set a year ago. Friday was a key day, because
August futures contracts expired.
</P>
<P>
   The idea behind the intervention has been to chase out
speculators _investors who bet against the market _ thereby
lowering interest rates and boosting the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say the intervention would be considered manipulation
elsewhere. Defenders counter that short-selling tactics employed by
fund managers here are illegal in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Financial Secretary Donald Tsang said Friday the government is
considering measures to ``tighten up discipline in the areas of
short-selling and stock borrowing,'' fueling concerns that market
controls might be imposed.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, government officials are describing the intervention
that began Aug. 14 and reached a fever pitch Friday as ``a war''
and ``armageddon'' against speculators. But most analysts predict
the scheme will backfire.
</P>
<P>
   The government's ``goal has not been achieved in the least.
Everyone has been leaving the market except for speculators,'' said
Mac Overton, fund manager for MBf Unit Trust Management in Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
   A number of countries, including the United Kingdom, Thailand,
Indonesia, Malaysia and Japan, have tried to intervene in their
markets and have failed, he said. A better use of public reserves
would have been to buy mortgages from banks, making them healthier
and better able to loan money.
</P>
<P>
   There are others who are more sympathetic to the government's
position, saying it needed to do something to prevent a collapse of
the market. The Hang Seng index had dropped nearly 60 percent in
the last year, and government buying raised the index 20 percent in
the last two weeks, saving some major companies from
balance-of-payment crises that would imperil banks.
</P>
<P>
   ``People make the mistake of thinking that a free market is the
same as a fair market,'' said Richard Verin, head of equity trading
in Asia for Credit Suisse First Boston. He said big overseas hedge
funds had taken advantage of the Hong Kong market, attacking the
currency and driving up interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   But the risk, he said, is that huge speculators may be too big
an opponent even for the government.
</P>
<P>
   Even many outspoken defenders of the government's intervention
two weeks ago had changed their tune by Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't approve of it anymore ... not of the amount of money
they have spent,'' said Jim Mellon, managing director of Regent
Pacific Group, a Hong Kong-based emerging markets fund manager.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong has $97 billion in reserves _ the second-highest in
the world after China's _ but $50 billion of that is set aside to
cover the basic money supply, since the currency is pegged to the
US dollar. Ten billion dollars will be needed to cover this year's
budget deficit, plus another $10 billion for next year's deficit,
Mellon says. He estimates the government had spent at least $6.5
billion by the end of trading Friday, leaving just $23.5 billion of
usable reserves _ a dangerously low figure. (The government has
refused to reveal how much it has spent in the market).
</P>
<P>
   In the end, he predicts, Hong Kong will lose _ not the
speculators.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hedge funds are like cockroaches,'' he said. ``You can drown
them, you can crush them, you can stamp them out. But they always
come back.''

EX-WYOMING GOVERNOR SELECTED AS US AMBASSADOR TO IRELAND 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and w coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. MARCUS AND ADAM PERTMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Snubbing several prominent East Coast contenders,
President Clinton Friday chose Michael J. Sullivan, a former
Wyoming governor and early supporter, as his nominee for ambassador
to Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan, known for his cowboy boots and his candid
conversations, is far better known for his domestic political savvy
that his knowledge of Ireland. But he is close to President Clinton
and has Republican support, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a marvelous stroke,'' said former Senator Alan Simpson,
a Wyoming Republican who is now director of the Institute of
Politics at Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government.
``Knowing Boston and the Irish community there, let me tell you,
they got one of their own.''
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan also has a Cambridg, Mass.e tie _ he taught at the
Kennedy school in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   If confirmed by the Senate, Sullivan will replace Jean Kennedy
Smith, whose controversial five-year term is the longest of any US
ambassador in Ireland. Smith, like Sullivan, is a descendent of
Irish immigrants who was not known for her expertise on Ireland
when she started. But she is leaving as a popular figure famous for
pushing along the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan was the first Western governor to support Clinton
before the 1992 presidential election. He is one of the few early
supporters yet to be rewarded with a desirable post by the
administration.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement followed more than a year of polite lobbying by
Irish-Americans, most of whom had favorite candidates from Boston
and other traditional bases of Irish immigrants. Those whose names
were floated included Paul S. Quinn, a Washington lawyer and Fleet
Bank lobbyist; Richard Riley, the Education Secretary; Mark Gearan,
head of the Peace Corps; Tom Donahue, a former union leader.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, the nomination process seemed to stir less anxiety among
Irish government officials than among Irish-Americans. In recent
interviews, the officials and Irish diplomats said that Clinton has
taken such an interest in the peace process that a single
ambassador probably will not make much of a difference in shaping
policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It a policy above personalities,'' an official in Dublin said
recently, emphasizing Sullivan's access to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan's name had been bandied about for months and the
nomination had been predicted by The Irish Times and other media,
but the timing was a surprise. The announcement came almost as an
afterthought toward the end of a briefing on Russia by Sandy
Berger, Clinton's national security adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will travel to Russia for a summit next week. The
president will spend Thursday, Friday, and Saturday in Ireland _
one of the few countries he has considered worth visiting two
times.
</P>
<P>
   The visit is expected to include stops in Dublin, Belfast, and
Ballybunion, where Clinton might play golf. He is also scheduled to
make a somber stop in Omagh, where on Aug. 15 a bomb killed 28
people.
</P>
<P>
   In an essay earlier this year, Joe Carroll, Washington
correspondent for The Irish Times and a former religion writer,
noted that, ``I thought cracking Vatican secrecy on the next
Archbishop of Dublin was as tough as it gets. But here in
Washington trying to find out who is going to be the next American
ambassador in Dublin is even tougher.''
</P>
<P>
   In June, Carroll wrote, ``The word around the corridors of power
is that the President's choice is Mike Sullivan from Wyoming. `Mike
who?' has been the almost universal reaction.''
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan _ who was said to answer his own phone as governor and
eschew a bodyguard _ liked to tout the advantages of the mountanous
state. According to a political biography, he told one audience,
``In my eight years as governor, I have tried to exercise a calm,
deliberative style of leadership based not on partisanship, but an
integrity founded on fundamental values and beliefs of what I
thought was best for the people of Wyoming.''
</P>
<P>
   In Cambridge Friday, Alan Simpson reminisced about how his
brother, Peter, a Republican, lost the governor's race to Sullivan
in 1986. Sullivan went on to win a second term in 1990 by a huge
margin.
</P>
<P>
   But no hard feelings. Simpson described Sullivan, a lawyer and
petroleum engineer, as a ``very steady, patient, thoughtful man.''
He added that Sullivan underwent quintuple bypass surgery earlier
this month but is in fine health.
</P>
<P>
   It was during his governorship that Sullivan and his wife, Jane,
got to know Hillary and Bill Clinton. When Clinton was in the New
Hampshire primary in 1992, Sullivan ``laid himself on the line'' by
campaigning for him, Simpson said.
</P>
<P>
   That seemingly cost Sullivan when he ran for US Senate in 1994,
when his opponent ran photos of Sullivan helping Clinton _ not a
popular figure in Republican-dominated Wyoming. He toured America
in a van after his defeat, then returned to practice law in Casper,
his hometown.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there ever was a reward for loyalty, that's what this is,''
Simpson said of the ambassadorial appointment, ``but there's much
more to it than that. This guy is remarkable.''
</P>
<P>
   Simpson said Sullivan reminds him of former Maine senator George
Mitchell _ ``he's a problem solver.'' He also described Sullivan as
``a thoughtful, articulate, moderate Democrat ... but also
antiabortion, though he's not a zealot on that issue.''

UNCERTAINTY SURROUNDS CLINTON AIDES AS THEY PLAN RUSSIA TRIP 
</HEADLINE>
   (See also RUSSIA-RDP, RUSSIA-YELTSIN, RUSSIA-U.S., RUSSIA-GERMANY,
RUSSIA-BANKAMERICA)  
(js) 
 By JAMES BENNET   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The scramble was on again Friday among President
Clinton's already seriously scrambled aides.
</P>
<P>
   Three days before they are scheduled to depart for a summit
meeting in Moscow, senior administration officials wondered which
Russians they would face across the conference tables. Clinton's
aides began rewriting his planned remarks on the future of
U.S.-Russian relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got an economy collapsing and a president on the verge
of resignation, and we're about to go there for a summit,'' one
administration official said Friday afternoon, referring to Russia
and President Boris Yeltsin. ``Of course they've been going crazy
at the White House.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Berger, Clinton's national security adviser, gave a more
measured assessment: ``Well, I think that, obviously, one needs to
make adjustments as the situation changes.''
</P>
<P>
   While presidential trips abroad generally are as subtle and
delicate as hurricanes, they are planned with the unstinting
fussiness of Chinese operas.
</P>
<P>
   The thick book laying out the president's schedule times his
movements down to what minute he will enter which elevator in what
dank basement (unless Clinton rewrites the official schedule as he
goes).
</P>
<P>
   Before the president went to Africa last spring, aides were
dispatched as much as a month ahead of time to haggle over access
and camera angles. With prompting from the administration, Botswana
even rushed a new cellular telephone system into service just ahead
of Air Force One's arrival.
</P>
<P>
   But this time, the only thing some weary presidential advisers
seemed certain of was that the news media would blame the White
House for Russian turmoil. ``It's our fault,'' one administration
official said, his sarcasm matched only by his exasperation. ``If
we'd been focused we would have improved the Russian tax collection
system. Why argue with you guys anymore? Terrorism? Our fault.''
</P>
<P>
   The basic elements of the trip are unlikely to change, several
officials said Friday. The pre-chewed matter dispensed on
presidential visits _ the so-called deliverables _ was prepared
during weeks of talks among aides. The two presidents will issue
joint statements on weapons proliferation, Kosovo, Caspian Sea oil
reserves and the Persian Gulf. And Clinton's major stops _
including a joint press conference with Yeltsin, a speech, and a
visit to a school _ are unlikely to be scrapped or adjusted.
</P>
<P>
   But the all-important tone of the trip, along with some of the
president's meetings and his precise words, may be debated right up
until he lands in Moscow Tuesday morning _ or even longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the president says in public, where he goes, who he meets
with _ that's more of what we're reviewing right now,'' one
administration official said. ``You want to project confidence and
our ability to get the job done, but the fact is it's fluid.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The White House has been a busy place this August. For the most
part, one set of aides has handled the biggest scandal of Clinton's
career _ his acknowledgment of an inappropriate relationship with
Monica Lewinsky _ while another set managed the biggest
counter-terrorist strike of his presidency, the cruise missiles
launched last week at Afghanistan and Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   But there has been some crossover, including, of course, the
president himself. Clinton will depart for Russia Monday afternoon
after what appears to have been one of the least restful family
vacations imaginable.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany, Yeltsin is the
only major non-communist leader who was serving when Clinton was
first elected in 1992. It is a shaky trio. Kohl is facing a tough
re-election campaign this year, and in May Clinton turned a stop in
Germany into a virtual campaign swing for his old friend.
</P>
<P>
   The president has also built an affectionate and trusting
relationship with Yeltsin, his aides say. But even before this
week's furor , he had planned to hedge U.S. bets in Russia. On
Wednesday, he will meet with leaders of Russia's parliament and
regions. That meeting, Clinton's aides said Friday, now takes on
new significance.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said that aides will probably have to
rejigger key points and questions that Clinton should raise with
Russian presidential hopefuls such as Alexander Lebed, a former
general who is now governor of a Siberian region.
</P>
<P>
   The two-day summit meeting is almost starting to shape up as an
intelligence-gathering mission, since the status of the Russian
government is so unclear. Clinton will meet with Yeltsin while
several Cabinet members also sit down with their counterparts _
whomever they may be.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very rare that the senior leadership of the United States
is going into a crisis environment,'' one official said , glimpsing
the bright side and calling it ``a real opportunity for senior
policymakers to get a first-hand look.''
</P>
<P>
   One adviser to Clinton said that the planning for the summit
meeting had settled down Friday after Yeltsin rejected the idea of
resignation. ``We're sort of more on track today than we were
yesterday,'' he said. Besides, he argued, the administration had
never expected the trip to Russia to be routine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like a completely stable situation went completely
unstable,'' he said. ``There's been uncertainty on several fronts
all along.''

ZENGA SHOWS HIS COACHING SIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WELLESLEY, Mass. _ Roles were defined during Walter Zenga's
first practice as coach of the Revolution Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a player with a lot of experience who has a good feeling
with the other players,'' Zenga said. ``As for being a true coach _
he is a coach.''
</P>
<P>
   And Zenga pointed to Sid Mazzola, the former Revolution scout
who is Zenga's assistant coach.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, Zenga is interim head coach of the Revolution. He
took charge at the start the workout at Babson College, postponing
an autograph-signing session with about a dozen youngsters by
saying, ``It is best if the coach is at the practice.''
</P>
<P>
   During the two-hour practice, Zenga held a plastic water bottle
and gave suggestions, especially to the defense. He stopped the
action, showed players how to mark on set pieces, to advance in
unison after a clearance _ just like a real coach.
</P>
<P>
   But Zenga, who retired in December after a 20-year career as a
goalkeeper, barely disguised his intention to return to a playing
role. He wore a Revolution uniform, took part in some drills,
exercised during breaks, joined the others in post-practice corner
kicks.
</P>
<P>
   ``What kind of coach will I be?'' Zenga said. ``I play to win,
and the only way to win is to score goals. Or, at least, score one
more goal than the other team.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Zenga will concentrate on defense first. The Revolution
have the worst goals-against record, and the worst record, in the
MLS as they chase tomorrow's opponent, the Miami Fusion, for the
final playoff berth in the Eastern Conference.
</P>
<P>
   In Italy, Zenga played for conservative, defensive specialists
such as Giovanni Trapattoni at Inter and Azeglio Vicini with the
national team. Those teams expected to play several games in
succession without surrendering a goal, and seldom gave up more
than two goals in a game. That was a different era, though, and
even Trapattoni is attempting to be progressive at Fiorentina this
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have played for great coaches, Trapattoni, Vicini, but every
coach has something to teach,'' Zenga said. ``We want to put a
balanced team on the field. We will trust the players and we will
put the players in the positions they belong. It's not like, I
arrive and everything changes. We have one chance for the playoffs,
and that is to win in Miami. I asked them to believe in that and to
think positive.''
</P>
<P>
   Zenga was unfamiliar with the Fusion, an expansion team which
has rallied recently since Brazilian Ivo Wortmann replaced Cacho
Cordoba as coach. Nor had he settled on a formation for the
Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Mazzola, though, has been plotting the Revolution's strategy
since Thomas Rongen resigned as coach Monday, two days after the
Revolution lost, 5-1, to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a last-place team,'' Mazzola said. ``We can beat
Miami.''
</P>
<P>
   Mazzola is used to building teams with limited resources and is
familiar with the local talent since he has coached the
Massachusetts representative in national amateur tournaments. When
Mazzola owned the Boston Bolts from 1988-90, he not only financed
the team but also selected the players and coached them. He had a
31-29 record and guided the Bolts to the American Professional
Soccer League playoffs in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want more variety in players, some with strong technical
qualities, some with speed, some with strength,'' Mazzola said. ``A
team must be built up the middle, with a central defender,
midfielder, and a striker who can play with his back to goal and
hold up the ball for play to develop.''
</P>
<P>
   Mazzola led the team during Wednesday's scrimmage against the
Rhode Island Stingrays, a 1-1 tie.
</P>
<P>
   The players responded with enthusiasm to the new coaching staff
_ even Ian Feuer, whose starting goalkeeping position could be
threatened if Zenga becomes player-coach next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, it couldn't be better for me to have one of the
best goalkeepers in the world as coach,'' Feuer said. ``You can
only learn from that. He's a nice guy with a good sense of humor.
He's had some great coaches and he's learned from them. Ever since
I was a young kid he's been a hero of mine, and I'm not saying that
because he's the coach.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the prospect of losing his position to the coach
next year, Feuer said: ``I'll battle him for it. I'm not here to be
a reserve keeper. But he's the coach and you have to respect
whatever decision he makes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we have to concentrate now on Sunday. Everyone is
upbeat about it. No disrespect to Thomas, but everyone wants to
work hard to get ready. I know (Zenga) wants to work on getting the
defense tighter.''
</P>
<P>
   Edwin Gorter will remain at sweeper, next to Brian Dunseth.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Zenga) has traveled the world, he knows soccer,'' Gorter
said. ``He said he is not a magician, he can only give more
stimulus to us. But he ... doesn't have the key to solve all our
problems in one day.''

CLINTON STRESSES IMPORTANCE OF SUMMIT WITH RUSSIA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ariz., Ind.)  (lb) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich said Friday that
President Clinton's plans to visit Moscow next week to meet the
beleaguered President Boris Yeltsin were ``imprudent'' and should
be canceled.
</P>
<P>
   While some prominent legislators from both parties urged Clinton
to proceed with the summit meeting, Gingrich added his own
influential voice to those who have criticized the meeting, which
comes in the midst of economic and political upheaval in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are two weak presidents trying to prop each other up,''
Gingrich said in a telephone interview Friday. ``Who knows what
kind of promises they'll make to each other, what they'll agree to?
I think it's very imprudent for him to go.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton was undeterred, speaking at Martha's Vineyard,
Mass., about the importance of friendship in difficult times, and
vowing to press ahead with the meeting and with an effort to aid
Russia if the new government there did ``the disciplined, hard
things they have to do to reform their country.''
</P>
<P>
   Defending his trip, Clinton said, ``Anybody can come see you
when you're doing well.'' Clinton spoke shortly after Soviet
television broadcast an interview in which a puffy Yeltsin
announced that he would not resign his office.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton received support for the summit from Sen. Daniel Patrick
Moynihan, D-N.Y., who said that the Indian-Pakistani nuclear
confrontation in South Asia was reason enough for Clinton to go to
Moscow. The Russians could help with the Indians, he said, ``and
we've not had that conversation with the Russians.'' A
collaboration to make South Asia stable ``would cost a lot of money
but it's worth the world,'' Moynihan said. ``That alone would be a
good morning's discussion.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., also said Clinton was right to go.
``To cancel now would be a further blow to what little credibility
Yeltsin has remaining,'' he said. ``The president should obviously
tell Yeltsin to get a grip on his country and recognize that we
can't pour good money after bad without evidence of reforms.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., said that Clinton should stress the
U.S. desire for a prosperous Russia, fully integrated in the world.
``There is a sour mood about Russian in Congress today, principally
because of their missile and nuclear help to Iran,'' Hamilton said.
``We have to engage Russia and build bridges when possible, but
also draw red lines about acceptable behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   In a theme echoed Friday by his national security adviser, Sandy
Berger, Clinton said that the United States had to stand with the
Russian people in their time of difficulty and be willing to help
if the Russians themselves made the hard sacrifices required to get
their house in order.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although the key political and economic choices are up to the
Russian people themselves,'' Berger said, ``we need to engage
actively, even _ or especially _ in a time of crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton would urge Russians to hold fast ``to the basic
objectives of democracy and economic reform in the face of new
challenges,'' Berger said. ``The Russian people should know that,
particularly in times of difficulty, the United States and the West
will not turn away from cooperation. As they do the things
necessary to restore stability and progress, we are prepared to
support them.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's officials, struggling themselves to prepare for a
summit meeting in a land undergoing a political and economic
earthquake, had encouraging news Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian acting prime minister, Viktor Chernomyrdin, told
Clinton administration officials privately that he had made no deal
with the Russian parliament that would undermine the general course
of economic reform, senior U.S. officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Although members of Chernomyrdin's own party were saying
``worrisome things'' about a more Soviet-style state control over
parts of the economy, one U.S. official said, Chernomyrdin ``tells
us he hasn't struck any deal on the policy stuff.'' At least he had
not done so yet, the official acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   He spoke after a half-hour conference call among Clinton, Deputy
Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, who is in Moscow, and Deputy
Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers. Talbott emphasized that
Yeltsin would not resign, that Russian officials of all stripes
wanted Yeltsin to attend the summit, and that the streets were
calm.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``They're not sacking kiosks to get crackers,'' the official
said. ``It's not like Clinton's walking into a maelstrom.''
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin has been negotiating with Russian parliamentary
leaders, including the Communist Party, on a broad economic and
political strategy for recovery. Chernomyrdin, who controls
parliament's second-largest faction, needs wider support to be
confirmed as prime minister, in a vote expected on Monday, as
Clinton leaves Washington for Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   But Chernomyrdin also needs parliament to pass legislation to
reform Russia's tax and pension systems, at least if Moscow expects
the next $4.3 billion of aid from the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Senior officials said they remained deeply concerned that the
Communists would strike a high price, and that Chernomyrdin might
have to give some ground to the call for stricter state controls on
the economy and for more rubles to be printed in order to reflate
industry and pay workers, driving up inflation and further
undermining the value of the ruble.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chernomyrdin can go pretty far toward the Communists,'' said
another senior official dealing with Russia. ``We understand that
he needs to stabilize the situation in terms of public reaction. He
needs a coalition. That's the concern: He needs their support and
they'll make him pay for it. But he's a lot smarter than they
are.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the official said, Washington had no real options.
``We're prepared to be generous in our interpretation of what
Chernomyrdin can put together. But frankly, we don't have any
choice. We don't have any alternatives, nor is anybody asking us
right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Berger conceded that Yeltsin's firing on Friday of reformers
Anatoly Chubais and Boris Nemtsov was ``not encouraging,'' but he
continued to emphasize that the policies of any new government
mattered more than its personnel.
</P>
<P>
   Berger and other officials continued to press their theme of
fundamental Russian responsibility for the country's troubles and
for their solutions. But Summers also emphasized that the IMF would
be prepared to be flexible, depending on the pace of reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``That has to be put in the context of Russian economic policy,
which is what we're waiting to see,'' Summers said. ``And at this
point, we don't have a Russian economic team; we don't have a
Russian economic plan.''
</P>
<P>
   And Berger said that important foreign-policy and security
issues could still be discussed in Moscow, including nuclear
stockpiles, the protection of fissile material, and Russia's
policies toward Iraq, Iran and Kosovo.

EX-WYOMING GOVERNOR SELECTED AS US AMBASSADOR TO IRELAND 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and w coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. MARCUS AND ADAM PERTMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Snubbing several prominent East Coast contenders,
President Clinton Friday chose Michael J. Sullivan, a former
Wyoming governor and early supporter, as his nominee for ambassador
to Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan, known for his cowboy boots and his candid
conversations, is far better known for his domestic political savvy
that his knowledge of Ireland. But he is close to President Clinton
and has Republican support, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a marvelous stroke,'' said former Senator Alan Simpson,
a Wyoming Republican who is now director of the Institute of
Politics at Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government.
``Knowing Boston and the Irish community there, let me tell you,
they got one of their own.''
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan also has a Cambridg, Mass.e tie _ he taught at the
Kennedy school in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   If confirmed by the Senate, Sullivan will replace Jean Kennedy
Smith, whose controversial five-year term is the longest of any US
ambassador in Ireland. Smith, like Sullivan, is a descendent of
Irish immigrants who was not known for her expertise on Ireland
when she started. But she is leaving as a popular figure famous for
pushing along the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan was the first Western governor to support Clinton
before the 1992 presidential election. He is one of the few early
supporters yet to be rewarded with a desirable post by the
administration.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement followed more than a year of polite lobbying by
Irish-Americans, most of whom had favorite candidates from Boston
and other traditional bases of Irish immigrants. Those whose names
were floated included Paul S. Quinn, a Washington lawyer and Fleet
Bank lobbyist; Richard Riley, the Education Secretary; Mark Gearan,
head of the Peace Corps; Tom Donahue, a former union leader.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, the nomination process seemed to stir less anxiety among
Irish government officials than among Irish-Americans. In recent
interviews, the officials and Irish diplomats said that Clinton has
taken such an interest in the peace process that a single
ambassador probably will not make much of a difference in shaping
policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It a policy above personalities,'' an official in Dublin said
recently, emphasizing Sullivan's access to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan's name had been bandied about for months and the
nomination had been predicted by The Irish Times and other media,
but the timing was a surprise. The announcement came almost as an
afterthought toward the end of a briefing on Russia by Sandy
Berger, Clinton's national security adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will travel to Russia for a summit next week. The
president will spend Thursday, Friday, and Saturday in Ireland _
one of the few countries he has considered worth visiting two
times.
</P>
<P>
   The visit is expected to include stops in Dublin, Belfast, and
Ballybunion, where Clinton might play golf. He is also scheduled to
make a somber stop in Omagh, where on Aug. 15 a bomb killed 28
people.
</P>
<P>
   In an essay earlier this year, Joe Carroll, Washington
correspondent for The Irish Times and a former religion writer,
noted that, ``I thought cracking Vatican secrecy on the next
Archbishop of Dublin was as tough as it gets. But here in
Washington trying to find out who is going to be the next American
ambassador in Dublin is even tougher.''
</P>
<P>
   In June, Carroll wrote, ``The word around the corridors of power
is that the President's choice is Mike Sullivan from Wyoming. `Mike
who?' has been the almost universal reaction.''
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan _ who was said to answer his own phone as governor and
eschew a bodyguard _ liked to tout the advantages of the mountanous
state. According to a political biography, he told one audience,
``In my eight years as governor, I have tried to exercise a calm,
deliberative style of leadership based not on partisanship, but an
integrity founded on fundamental values and beliefs of what I
thought was best for the people of Wyoming.''
</P>
<P>
   In Cambridge Friday, Alan Simpson reminisced about how his
brother, Peter, a Republican, lost the governor's race to Sullivan
in 1986. Sullivan went on to win a second term in 1990 by a huge
margin.
</P>
<P>
   But no hard feelings. Simpson described Sullivan, a lawyer and
petroleum engineer, as a ``very steady, patient, thoughtful man.''
He added that Sullivan underwent quintuple bypass surgery earlier
this month but is in fine health.
</P>
<P>
   It was during his governorship that Sullivan and his wife, Jane,
got to know Hillary and Bill Clinton. When Clinton was in the New
Hampshire primary in 1992, Sullivan ``laid himself on the line'' by
campaigning for him, Simpson said.
</P>
<P>
   That seemingly cost Sullivan when he ran for US Senate in 1994,
when his opponent ran photos of Sullivan helping Clinton _ not a
popular figure in Republican-dominated Wyoming. He toured America
in a van after his defeat, then returned to practice law in Casper,
his hometown.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there ever was a reward for loyalty, that's what this is,''
Simpson said of the ambassadorial appointment, ``but there's much
more to it than that. This guy is remarkable.''
</P>
<P>
   Simpson said Sullivan reminds him of former Maine senator George
Mitchell _ ``he's a problem solver.'' He also described Sullivan as
``a thoughtful, articulate, moderate Democrat ... but also
antiabortion, though he's not a zealot on that issue.''

DOW DROPS AGAIN AS INVESTORS FEAR SLOWING EARNINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By EDWARD WYATT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stock prices fell sharply again Friday, as continued
fears about instability in Russia and economic weakness closer to
home produced the worst week for the American stock market in nine
years.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average declined 114.31 points, or 1.4
percent, to close at 8051.68. For the week, the Dow industrials
were down 5.6 percent. Not since the so-called ``mini-crash'' of
October 1989, when the Dow fell 7.8 percent, has the bellwether
index fallen so far so fast.
</P>
<P>
   The decline Friday was a mere shadow of the 4.1 percent drop on
Thursday. But a stream of global losses continued, with financial
markets in Asia and Europe particularly hard hit.
</P>
<P>
   In the course of the last week, American investors have begun
shifting their attention away from Russia and other foreign
economies to the weakening outlook for corporate profits at home.
</P>
<P>
   Those concerns showed up Friday in the loss in the Nasdaq
Composite index, which is chock-full of the computer and Internet
stocks that are enormously popular with individual investors.
Traders aggressively sold shares of Dell Computer, Cisco Systems,
Yahoo and Amazon.com, stocks that have been among the biggest
gainers of the year. The Nasdaq index fell 46.73 points, or 2.8
percent, to 1639.68, and finished the week 8.8 percent lower.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the recent losses, most investors in these technology
stocks are sitting on enormous gains: Amazon.com, for example, is
still up 251 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   Some investors, and a few analysts on Wall Street, are beginning
to worry, though, that profits for these and other American
companies might not grow as much as expected next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is not just in Asia anymore,'' said James Paulsen,
chief investment officer at Norwest Investment Management in
Minneapolis. ``Look to the north and south,'' where the Canadian
and Mexican economies are struggling. That could more directly
affect the profits of American companies, he said, keeping profit
growth below 5 percent annually for the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few years, investors have come to expect growth of
10 percent or more. Others are even less optimistic. ``We see no
real earnings growth in 1998 or 1999, and we're uncertain about the
year 2000,'' said Peter Anderson, chief investment officer at
American Express Financial Advisors. With that outlook, it is hard
to justify current market prices, much less the far higher
valuations of just a few weeks' ago.
</P>
<P>
   Since closing at a record high on July 17, the Dow industrials
have lost 13.8 percent of their value, exceeding the 13.3 percent
decline from August through October of last year. The major stock
indexes are still showing gains for the year _ the Dow is up 1.8
percent, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index is up 5.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But individuals who invest through mutual funds are more likely
to be in the red. According to Lipper Analytical Services, the
average general stock fund was down 2.8 percent from the beginning
of the year through Thursday, meaning the recent plunge has started
to eat into the profits accumulated over the last three roaring
years.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market attempted to rally Friday. In the first half
hour of trading, the Dow industrials jumped more than 78 points.
But in 15 minutes, they lost all that and more, as sell orders
flooded in. The rest of the day, virtually any rally in share
prices was met with further bouts of heavy selling.
</P>
<P>
   Some market analysts continue to be optimistic, chief among them
Abby Joseph Cohen of Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co. In a note to clients
Friday, Ms. Cohen said that the recent declines in equity prices
``have been more closely linked to changes in sentiment than
changes in the fundamental backdrop in the United States.'' She
added that the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index, which fell 5 percent
last week and is 13.4 percent below its high, ``is now 7 percent to
10 percent undervalued.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   She now favors technology and financial services stocks, which
suffered sharp blows again Friday. Information is beginning to
dribble out about the exposure of banks and securities firms to
losses in foreign markets from loans, securities trades and complex
financial contracts known as derivatives.
</P>
<P>
   BankAmerica Corp. and BankBoston Corp. each reported heavy
losses from the trading of domestic and international assets.
BankAmerica said it has lost $220 million this quarter, primarily
because of Russia, leaving it with trading profits of $315 million
for the year. BankBoston said its international and domestic
trading operations have lost $30 million in this quarter, with only
one-third of the loss related to Russia. Having focused on Russia
losses until now, investors in financial stocks began to fret more
about losses in other locales, including Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Worries about the Russian economy, and its possible ripple
effects through much of the developing world, continued to weigh on
foreign markets Friday. Share prices fell more than 2 percent in
Britain and 1.7 percent in Germany, while Japan's Nikkei index slid
3.5 percent and finished the day below 14,000, at its lowest level
in 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   But Latin American markets, which have been swamped by selling
in recent weeks, took a breather. Mexico's major stock market index
gained 3.2 percent, and Brazil's rose nearly 2 percent _ small
gains, but important for markets that have lost more than one-third
of their value since January.
</P>
<P>
   Investors worldwide generally sought safety, and in the United
States they snapped up shares of electric utilities,
telecommunications companies and others that pay high, steady
dividends. Shares of Consolidated Edison, for example, rose 1 3/16,
to 47 13/16, their highest level in a year, as the Dow Jones
utilities average rose nearly 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The utilities index, in fact, has gained 3.9 percent since the
beginning of January, more than twice the gain in the Dow
industrials.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks of regional telephone companies also rose Friday, with
Ameritech, Bellsouth and Bell Atlantic among the winners. Bell
Atlantic gained 2 to 45 3/16.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest losses were among the technology stocks that have a
fervent following of individual investors. Dell Computer fell 6
5/16 to 118.75, while Cisco Systems dropped 4 7/16 to 94 11/16;
meanwhile Amazon.com dropped 13 7/64 to 105 57/64 and Yahoo dropped
8 to 83 1/16.
</P>
<P>
   Investors who have held those stocks for the year may be wincing
at the latest declines but reminding themselves of their nice gains
earlier this year. And in general, the market's drop in recent
weeks is still not considered severe by many Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not yet even back to where we started the year,'' said
Paulsen of Norwest about the latest decline. ``People are saying
`Oh, isn't that interesting.' If we got down another 15 percent, to
where their net worths were back to where they were in 1996, they
may begin to worry.''

COMPLAINT AGAINST BOMB SUSPECT SHEDS NEW LIGHT ON BIN LADEN GROUP 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVID JOHNSTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The federal government's case against Osama bin
Laden, the wealthy Islamic militant suspected of directing the
bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, emerged in
sharper detail Friday as federal agents brought a second suspect to
New York to face charges in the attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The federal charges against the suspect, Mohammed Saddiq Odeh,
were contained in a complaint unsealed Friday in federal court. The
complaint provided a sketch of the global reach and sophisticated
operations of bin Laden's group, Al Qaeda, whose chief objective,
the complaint said, was the killing of Americans, including
civilians, anywhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
   According to the complaint, Odeh played a role in terrorist
actions in Kenya and other countries including Somalia, where he
trained Islamic fighters against United Nations forces, which
included 1,800 U.S. servicemen. He worked in an independent unit
that he said was managed by senior commanders and concealed its
activities through legitimate businesses like a fishing company set
up in Mombassa by Odeh using Al Qaeda money.
</P>
<P>
   The focus on Odeh's relationship to bin Laden's group suggested
that prosecutors hope to persuade the two men in custody in New
York to provide more detailed information about the activities of
bin Laden, who Odeh referred to in his interviews with agents as
the ``emir'' or prince of the terrorist organization.
</P>
<P>
   More detailed information could help prosecutors expand their
charges against bin Laden, who has already been indicted for
terrorist acts committed before the Aug. 7 bombings in Africa and
has emerged as the principal architect and financier of the embassy
attacks. Friday's complaint offered a tentative road map to what
some of those charges might include.
</P>
<P>
   Odeh told federal agents, the complaint said, that he accepted
responsibility for the bombing. But he denied a direct role in the
attack, saying he left Nairobi on Aug. 6, one day before the blast.
Nevertheless, he acknowledged meeting with bin Laden confederates
at a Nairobi hotel and visited the U.S. Embassy grounds three days
before the explosion, which killed 258 people and wounded thousands
of others.
</P>
<P>
   Odeh's lawyer, Jack Sachs, said his client acknowledged
membership in bin Laden's group, but denied knowing that members in
Kenya were planning to bomb the embassy. ``He has stated to being a
member of the organization but he has not admitted to taking part
in any acts,'' Sachs said. ``He didn't confess to doing it. There
was no confession.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Odeh appeared briefly at a hearing in federal court in
Manhattan before U.S. Magistrate Sharon Grubin who ordered him held
in jail pending another hearing Sept. 28.
</P>
<P>
   The charges against Odeh were identical to those brought against
another member of bin Laden's organization, Mohamed Rashed Daoud
al-'Owhali, who was brought to New York from Kenya on Thursday
after agents accused him of riding in the bomb-laden truck and
throwing a dummy grenade at an embassy security guard seconds
before the explosion.
</P>
<P>
   Odeh was charged with conspiracy to commit murder, use of a
weapon of mass destruction and 12 counts of murder, one count for
each of the Americans killed in the Nairobi bombing. If found
guilty of the charges he could face a maximum sentence of life in
prison or death. Odeh was ordered held in jail pending another
hearing in the case, which is scheduled for Sept. 28, when another
hearing is planned for al-'Owhali.
</P>
<P>
   After the hearing, Sachs said that Odeh was 33 years old and
apparently of Jordanian descent, although he was carrying a Yemeni
passport when he was initially detained in Karachi, Pakistan, on a
flight from Kenya. Sachs said that Odeh has a wife and small child
who are living in Amman, Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer said that the government's account of Odeh's
relationship with bin Laden contained some mistakes that he would
not discuss. But Sachs confirmed that Odeh knows bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows him and that's his leader,'' Sachs said, adding that
Odeh did not agree with bin Laden's encouragement of violent acts
against civilians. ``It was not his mission in life to injure
unarmed civilians,'' the lawyer said. ``He said that it was against
his religion to kill unarmed civilians.''
</P>
<P>
   Odeh who authorities have suspected of helping to build the bomb
_ although he has denied it _ studied engineering in the
Philippines. The lawyer made no reference to the government's
reports of Odeh's fishing business while living in Kenya, but said
Odeh made and sold furniture.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint Friday against Odeh provided the first official
indication that investigators had connected bin Laden's group to
events like the attacks on U.S. soldiers in Somalia. Odeh told
investigators that in 1993 he helped train Islamic fighters who
opposed the U.N. forces in Somalia.
</P>
<P>
   The 26-month peacekeeping mission to Somalia ended in 1995, but
it was a 1993 battle in which 18 Army Rangers were killed in the
streets of Mogadishu that had a searing effect on U.S. military
thinking. Government officials have said the battle resulted in a
cautious narrowing of the military's role in aid missions to
countries like Rwanda and Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's complaint hinted that bin Laden might have had a hand
in attacks on Americans in Saudi Arabia, saying that Odeh said that
``hypothetically'' he would consider a bombing of Americans in
Saudi Arabia, where there have been two attacks in recent years.
The first, in November 1995 at a U.S.-run military training center
in Riyadh, killed seven people, including five Americans. The
second, in June 1996 at an apartment complex in Dhahran, killed 19
U.S. airmen. Both cases remains unsolved.

 &HT;    African-Americans to stage youth rallies
 &HT;    By S.A. Reid
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- First there was the historic 1995 Million Man March
in the nation's capital, then two years later the Million Woman
March in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Now young African-Americans are preparing to stage their own
mass gatherings Labor Day weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Convened by separate networks of young activists, the Million
Youth Movement in Atlanta and Million Youth March in New York are
organized, like their predecessors, around similar themes: black
empowerment and nation building.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young people have to be an integral part,'' said Ati
Cushmeer-Muhammad, coordinator of the Atlanta event. ``Their voices
must be heard.''
</P>
<P>
   Each of these grass-roots events is intended to be more than a
feel-good gathering. Participants see them as serious efforts to
help solve problems that ail African-American youth.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for both gatherings grew out of the Million Man March,
but ideological differences prevented them from coming together
into a single event.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point we're not against each other, just working on
two different pieces,'' said Olimatta Taal, Southern region
co-chair of the New York march.
</P>
<P>
   African-American youth aren't monolithic and need a choice,
organizers say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any event that will energize and mobilize young blacks in
America is good,'' said Byron Amos, Southern region co-chair of the
New York event.
</P>
<P>
   Planners for the black nationalist-tinged event, scheduled for
Thursday through Saturday in Harlem, will use the occasion to call
for reparations, self-determination, an end to gang violence,
creation of youth security groups and a re-dedication to nation
building.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Million Man March was good, the Million Woman March was
good,'' Taal said. ``But to me, the agendas weren't strong enough
for the issues we face.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the statistics are daunting for African-American youths:
Every three hours, a young adult is murdered; every day a child and
four young adults die from AIDS; every eight minutes, a youth is
arrested for a violent crime; and every 45 seconds of a school day,
a child drops out, according to statistics gathered by the Black
Community Crusade for Children, a Washington-based advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   Organizing for both events has been under way for months. And
though each has attracted its own set of high-profile supporters,
neither has yet to match the groundswell of interest of the Million
Man March.
</P>
<P>
   The New York event is being convened by the controversial
Minister Khallid Abdul Muhammad, a former high-ranking Nation of
Islam official accused of anti-Semitism. Organizers, whose
anticipated crowd estimates range from 150,000 to 3 million,
earlier this week won a court battle to force New York City
officials to approve their parade permit.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta planners, however, say they have had none of those
problems and on Friday secured their special-event permit from the
city.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers hope their event, which begins Sept. 4 with a town
hall meeting at the Shrine of the Black Madonna in West End, will
lead to the development of a 10-year action plan and annual
summits. They, too, call for reparations and self-determination.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the legacy we want to leave behind,'' said
Cushmeer-Muhammad. ``We're asking young people to help be an
integral part of improving the lives of other young people.''
</P>
<P>
   Activities will focus on spiritual, social, political,
educational and economic issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not Freaknik, Part 2,'' said Cushmeer-Muhammad.
``We're looking at a God-centered movement, planned activities and
young people coming with chaperones. We're not looking at a party
atmosphere.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta organizers expect thousands to participate, including
NAACP President Kweisi Mfume.
</P>
<P>
   Their effort could get a boost from the Rainbow/PUSH Coalition,
which plans to do a mass mailing by Monday urging Georgia youth to
attend.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a positive thing they are trying to do,'' said Joe
Beasley, the organization's Southern regional director. ``Of
course, many of us had hoped for one march instead of two.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, the official travel agency for the Atlanta event, the
Virginia Beach, Va.-based American Way, has received very few
calls, according to agent Ana Moreno.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate sponsorships have not materialized. Donations and
in-kind services totaling roughly $40,000 fall short of the event's
$55,000 estimated cost.
</P>
<P>
   Budget constraints have made it necessary to confine activities
to smaller venues, such as the Shrine.
</P>
<P>
   City officials have worked closely with Atlanta organizers,
whose long list of endorsees includes council members C.T. Martin
and Mable Thomas, as well as a coalition of civil rights advocates.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've seen the Million Man March and the Million Woman
March,'' said Thomas, a supporter of both events. ``It didn't
surprise me that young people want to be in a leadership position
to say they are the next leaders of the new millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   Julian Bond, the NAACP's board chairman, has given his support,
as have the National Council of Negro Women, the Rev. Jesse
Jackson, Georgia Association of Black Elected Officials, Nation of
Islam leader Minister Louis Farrakhan, Black Law Students
Association and the Atlanta-based rap group Goodie Mob.
</P>
<P>
   Bond, however, has expressed concern about the simultaneous
scheduling.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's problematic because it appears to be headed toward a test
of wills. Who will draw the biggest crowd?'' the civil rights
stalwart told the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel. ``It may not reflect
who is really reaching the young people, but we will all be looking
if 10,000 show up at one march and one million show up at the
other.''
</P>
<P>
   But Beasley warned against playing the numbers game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime you have young people coming together around issues,
it's positive, however many are there,'' he said. ``We're declaring
it a success already.''

 &HT;    Randstad buys staffing unit of rival in $850 million deal
 &HT;    By Tammy Joyner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Randstad Holdings NV, the Dutch parent of
Atlanta-based Randstad Staffing Services, has acquired the
commercial staffing arm of rival AccuStaff Inc. in an $850 million
cash deal.
</P>
<P>
   Once a regional bit player, the Atlanta company now vaults into
the top 10 in the $54 billion U.S. temporary staffing industry,
surpassing its Atlanta competitor, Norrell Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition of Strategix Solutions, one of the largest deals
in the industry, also puts Randstad Staffing on par with giants
Manpower and Kelly Services in the United States. Its parent,
Randstad Holdings NV, already is the world's sixth-largest staffing
firm.
</P>
<P>
   Randstad Staffing will now have 440 offices in 36 states and
$1.4 billion in revenue. Together, Randstad Staffing and Strategix
have about 65,000 people working nationwide on an average day.
Randstad Staffing's 600-employee complex at Windy Hill Road and
I-75 will be the headquarters for the newly combined companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will put Randstad (Holdings) in a race with Manpower and
Adecco for global leadership,'' said Peter Yessne, editor of
Staffing Industry Report in Los Altos, Calif. ``Manpower and Adecco
had head starts because they were in many European countries.
Randstad was perhaps at the next level ... but it had a small U.S.
presence. So it's a big jump for them.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal began unfolding in June when officials at Randstad
Holdings approached Accustaff after learning of its intention to
sell Strategix.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been our long-term goal to establish a solid market share
nationally and this of course is a fairly sizable step in
accomplishing that,'' Randstad Staffing President Erik Vonk said.
``The companies are complementary to each other. There's hardly any
overlap.'' Vonk, also a member of the holding company's executive
board, said he does not expect any layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement also meant good news for AccuStaff. Shares of
the Jacksonville-based company rose 31 percent Friday on news of
the acquisition, which ended plans to take Strategix public. The
stock closed Friday at $17, up $1. AccuStaff will now focus on its
information technology consulting and professional services
business.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson-Humphrey analyst Mark Allen said the deal is a ``good
move'' for Randstad and Accustaff. It lets Accustaff focus on its
primary business and ``Randstad has a vehicle to move into the
higher end skills sets,'' which yield higher profit margins.

2 OPTIONS FOR CLINTON: RESIGNATION OR IMPEACHMENT  
 (EMBARGOED FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 30) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN KOLBE  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (UNDATED) - ``This has gone on too long...and hurt too many
innocent people.'' &QL; 
_Bill Clinton, Aug. 17 &QL; 
 &QL; 
In what may have been the least satisfactory presidential crisis
speech in television history, the president did make one assertion
on which nearly all his countrymen, amazingly, might agree. This
truly has gone on too long.
</P>
<P>
   People may differ, however, over just what ``this'' is.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made it clear what he meant. He said it during a
diatribe blaming independent counsel Ken Starr for his woes, as if
the evil prosecutor had somehow thrust Monica Lewinski into an
unsuspecting president's arms. He wants Starr's investigation to
shut down (begin ital) ``now,'' (end ital) and Americans to forget
everything.
</P>
<P>
   His constituents, however, might be excused if they have a
different take on his remark. For many of them, it's the saga of
lies, denials, debauchery, delays, and lawyerly half-truths that
must end.
</P>
<P>
   But must it? And if so, how?
</P>
<P>
   The investigation, declares CNN's Bill Press, is ``totally
absurd...It's about sex.'' And as such, Clinton adds, ``it's
nobody's business but ours.'' Feminist Wendy Kaminer wonders: ``Why
should we hold the president to standards of moral behavior that
few of us meet consistently?''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, as we're often reminded, the economy's in great shape
(although the cheerleaders may want to reconsider after last week).
So why sweat sex?
</P>
<P>
   The president's defenders want us to think of adultery like
jaywalking, risky at times but mostly harmless. But it isn't. It's
``a betrayal of a very high order,'' as virtue maven Bill Bennett
has written and any victimized spouse can attest, shattering
``fragile...social networks,'' causing ``acute emotional damage,''
and in a public arena, extinguishing any claim to moral authority.
``Leaders who flout moral codes weaken them.''
</P>
<P>
   In any event, this wasn't ``just about sex.'' This was Bill
Clinton's defining crisis, like Kennedy's missile crisis or Bush's
Gulf war. It was about saving his presidency. And he lied.
</P>
<P>
   When the president accosted a 21-year-old intern (and kept doing
so for 18 months) in his office while at work, wagged his finger
and lied to us about it, enlisted aides to spread the deceit,
launched a smear campaign against his own government's lawyers and
forced them to spend months and millions of our dollars searching
for answers he already had, he made it (begin ital) our (end ital)
business.
</P>
<P>
   Against that history, Americans not only have a right, but a
(begin ital) civic duty, (end ital) to be offended. To do less, to
accept his reckless behavior as a political norm, is an affront to
public order.
</P>
<P>
   Every time he snips a ribbon, or awards a medal, or makes a
speech, or trades toasts with another crippled foreign leader (as
he is scheduled to do this week) without paying a price for
offenses that would get him fired at almost any company or
government agency in America, is a rebuke to the structure of
values which has always made the United States a beacon of freedom
and goodness in a treacherous, immoral world.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that...we still live well,'' wrote John Updike,
``cannot ease the pain of feeling that we no longer live nobly.''
Six out of seven Americans, says pollster Daniel Yankelovich, fear
``something is fundamentally wrong with America's social
condition.''
</P>
<P>
   If he really cares about his agenda, which is now dead in the
water, and the country he claims to work for tirelessly, which is
flailing aimlessly amid a growing global economic and political
crisis, Clinton would resign honorably.
</P>
<P>
   But the fact that we all assume he won't speaks volumes about
the degree of self-absorption we see in him.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Americans are properly wary of this political death penalty, but
in their wariness they assume that it is reserved only for extreme
violations of the law. Not so. ``High crimes and misdemeanors''
dates from the 14th Century, and applies only to offenses meriting
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Such offenses, wrote Hamilton in the ``Federalist Papers,''
``may with peculiar propriety be denominated as political, as they
relate chiefly to injuries done immediately to the society
itself.'' The impeachment power is for ``keeping (officers)
virtuous whilst they continue to hold their public trust,'' said
Madison.
</P>
<P>
   ``Impeachment is the first step in a remedial process,''
reported the House Judiciary Committee in 1974. One of its staffers
was named Hillary Rodham.
</P>
<P>
   She should know, in more ways than one, that this has ``gone on
too long.'' &QL;

PLEASE DON'T PASS AROUND HOMER RECORD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is with deep despair and sincere apologies that I come to you
today. I looked in the mirror yesterday morning and there, staring
back at me, was an old fuddy-duddy.
</P>
<P>
   It was a shocking discovery, but there's no getting around it.
The evidence was unmistakable. There the fuddy-duddy stood,
gray-haired, narrow-minded and with a queasy stomach at the idea
that baseball's most hallowed record is about to fall.
</P>
<P>
   That's at the crux of it, you see.
</P>
<P>
   I've decided I don't want to see Roger Maris' home-run record
broken.
</P>
<P>
   I thought I could handle it. Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa are
both nice guys. Either one would be a fine representative. That's
what I've been telling myself for weeks now.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not working any more, and I can no longer pretend that
I don't care.
</P>
<P>
   I care too much.
</P>
<P>
   This, you must understand, is baseball's most hallowed record.
It has already been broken once in my lifetime. That'll do just
fine, thank you very much.
</P>
<P>
   I know, you're caught up in the chase. I understand. It's
exciting. It's something to talk about. And if you weren't around
to watch it happen in 1961, then it's your chance to be in on a
piece of history.
</P>
<P>
   All that's well and good.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, I have this bad feeling that we may be in on
history every year from now till the cows come home.
</P>
<P>
   I fear that what was once a sacred record, held for 34 years by
``The Babe'' and for 37 years now by Maris, is about to be passed
around like a quart of Schlitz at a frat party, like a wrinkled
copy of Playboy in a baseball clubhouse, like a platter of fried
chicken at a church potluck supper.
</P>
<P>
   What if it's Big Mac this year and every French fry in the bag
next year? Or what if it's Big Mac and So-So this year and some
shortstop the next?
</P>
<P>
   Is that really what you want?
</P>
<P>
   That's the problem. There's something wrong here, and we've
gotten so caught up in whether it's going to be McGwire, or Sosa,
or a dozen other guys just like 'em that we can't see it.
</P>
<P>
   If it is just McGwire and he is going to hold the record for the
next 30 years, that would be fine. Bring him on and we'll sing his
praises and explore the wonders of ``andro'' together.
</P>
<P>
   But if it's McGwire leading the cast of Saving Private Ryan in
an annual assault on the beaches of baseball's record book, can we
call timeout and rethink our position?
</P>
<P>
   Are we the unwitting victims of a baseball ``conspiracy,''
devised to rejuvenate the game and provoke August and September
sellouts in normally semiconscious communities like Pittsburgh,
Milwaukee and Miami?
</P>
<P>
   That's a possibility that noted Fort Worth baseball historian
Larry Swindell has considered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a clear pattern that you can find,'' contends
Swindell, who believes that baseball has often responded to crises
with a juiced and livelier baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that somebody who is very significant to major-league
baseball is whoever is responsible for ordering the baseballs,''
Swindell says. ``We don't know who that is _ maybe a clerk in the
commissioner's office _ but we do know that the balls change from
season to season.''
</P>
<P>
   Do you realize that when Ruth hit his 60 home runs in 1927, the
only other player in the American League to hit more than 20 that
year was Lou Gehrig, who had 47?
</P>
<P>
   ``That magnifies Ruth's accomplishment even more,'' Swindell
says. ``He revolutionized the game.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1961, when Maris and Mickey Mantle waged their two-man chase
of Ruth's record in September, 40 major-leaguers hit 20 or more
homers, a dozen passed the 30 mark and eight had 40 or more.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all the press that the home run got last year, I
predicted that the ball would be at least as juiced this year, if
not more so,'' Swindell says. ``It's not just McGwire and Sosa.
There are a number of others at 40 who will be pushing toward 50
and there will be another big group at 30 or more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty home runs used to be the mark of a slugger. Now it's
nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Example: Will Clark hit his 20th for the Rangers yesterday, the
first time he's reached that mark since 1991 in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's another reason why I think it's a combination of the
ball and the bat,'' Swindell says. ``Have you ever seen a season
where there were so many pitchers hit by balls? Never. There must
have been five instances this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ball is being hit harder than it's ever been hit before.''
</P>
<P>
   Harder and more often, for a variety of reasons, from expansion,
to year-round conditioning, to the technology of vitamins and
creatine shakes.
</P>
<P>
   Call me an old fuddy-duddy, but I shudder at the thought of the
most honored record in baseball history being passed around like a
bottle of Thunderbird at a hobos' convention.

GORDON WINS POLE POSITION AT NHIS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUDON, N.H. _ No longer employed by Hendrick Motorsports, Ricky
Craven may have been conspicuously absent Friday at New Hampshire
International Speedway, but he was not forgotten by former teammate
Jeff Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   Winner of eight races and seven pole positions this season,
Gordon, the two-time and defending NASCAR Winston Cup champion,
added yet another bauble to his overflowing treasure chest by
winning his eighth pole of the season for Sunday's Farm Aid on
Country Music Television 300 at New Hampshire International
Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Craven returned from a three-month layoff in July to win the
pole for the Jiffy Lube 300 at NHIS.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess since my old buddy Ricky Craven wasn't here to qualify
today, he decided to let me have a pole this weekend,'' said
Gordon, who battled slippery track conditions at the one-mile oval
to win his first pole at NHIS by turning a fast lap of 129.033
miles per hour in his No. 24 Dupont Chevrolet Monte Carlo. ``We
were a little worried going out early (in the qualifying order),
but luckily we weren't in the Top 10. We were 15th and that
certainly helped.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just got a really good lap and tried to be a little
conservative going into (Turn) 1,'' he added. ``I've overdrove
going into 1 several times and ended up 21st, and further back than
that before. And so, I got into 1 and the car felt good and really
carried a lot of speed the rest of the way around the track. As
long as you stayed in the groove today, which wasn't easy to do,
you could get a pretty good lap and really get some grip.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, track officials had each turn treated with
seven 45-gallon drums of ``asphalt reconditioner,'' a mix of liquid
asphalt and sand, in an attempt to expand the racing groove around
the track.
</P>
<P>
   However, several drivers experienced trouble getting their
groove back after sliding off it and hitting the wall. Dale
Earnhardt; Jeff Burton, a two-time winner at NHIS; Sterling Marlin,
and Ernie Irvan all made wall contact during Friday morning's
practice session. Earnhardt, who was 18th fastest (127.002 m.p.h.);
Irvan, who was 19th fastest (126.918), and Burton, who barely made
the first-round cut at 25th fastest (126.677), were forced to
qualify in backup cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's already becoming one of my best friends right now,''
Earnhardt said of his backup. ``Coming off the truck with about 45
minutes worth of practice and being able to qualify in the Top 25,
I feel good about the car. I think I could have done a little more
with it, but after wrecking I was a little careful.''
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Labonte took a stab at the pole but qualified second
fastest (128.398) in his No. 18 Interstate Batteries Pontiac. Ken
Schrader, who set a track record (129.423) by winning the pole for
last year's Jiffy Lube 300, was third fastest (128.212) while Kenny
Wallace (128.182) and Mark Martin (128.079) rounded out the top
five qualifiers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were one of the fastest cars here in practice the earlier
(July) race last year. We went out to qualify and all but lost it
going into Turn 1,'' said Gordon, who will take a 67-point lead
over Martin in the Winston Cup standings into Sunday's race. ``I
just tried to carry too much speed into Turn 1 and I tried to drive
it like I was in practice. I think, just learning from Ricky
Craven, and talking to him about running around here, and from that
experience of practically losing control going into 1 (helped).''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he missed Craven, who was replaced by Wally Dallenbach
after he resigned from the No. 50 Budweiser Chevrolet, Gordon said,
``There's nobody that wanted things to work out more for Ricky than
me _ other than maybe himself. I was one of the key people who
influenced Hendrick into hiring him. I think Ricky's a great race
car driver and I hope he gets some good opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a chemistry thing,'' he added. ``The guy's on the
Bud team have struggled and it was hard for them to get people to
stay together, and I hate that it didn't work out for Ricky or for
Hendrick.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
------ &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ted Christopher of Plainville, Conn., won the pole for
Saturday's CMT Twin 100s Busch North Series race with a lap of
123.446 m.p.h. ``We won this race last year,'' said Christopher,
``so hopefully I'm going to win it again.'' ... Driving with a
broken left thumb, Mike Ewanitsko, of North Babylon, N.Y., won his
fourth pole position of the 1998 Featherlite Modified Series with a
fast lap of 129.366.

HONG KONG'S MARKET MEDDLING DRAWS MIXED REVIEWS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md.)  (jw) 
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ Amid the battering of stock markets around the world
this week, Hong Kong has seemed strangely stable _ an oasis of calm
in a storm. But appearances are deceiving.
</P>
<P>
   In a climax to an unprecedented two-week-long direct
intervention in the stock market, Hong Kong's government spent at
least $8 billion Friday on a frenzied buying spree to prop up
shares and foil speculators it accuses of manipulating its market.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, an earlier round of intervention had managed to
push the Hong Kong stock market up while every other market around
the globe was down. Friday, for all the money spent, the benchmark
Hang Seng index still declined 93.23 points, or 1.2 percent, to
7,829.74.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong has always been unusual in Asia, practically a lone
outpost of free markets in a region of state-managed capitalism.
The government, while committed to a fixed exchange rate with the
U.S. dollar and even prepared to try to support the property market
the way South Africa's DeBeers regulates the price of diamonds,
historically has gone to great lengths to avoid all trade
restrictions and keep hands off its financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   So, in a city where tracking the Hang Seng is a favorite parlor
game, Friday's wild ride _ by far the market's biggest trading
volume ever _ left people slack-jawed. At moments during the
morning trading session, the Hong Kong Stock Exchange seemed less a
market than a giant clearance sale, with the government buying
everything in sight.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did this at a time when there is gloom around the
world,'' said Glenn Lesko, the director of regional sales and
trading at ABN Amro Securities in Hong Kong. ``I think they ran
into far more sellers than they expected.''
</P>
<P>
   Government officials, however, claimed victory. They said the
intervention had stabilized the Hang Seng, even as markets across
Asia, Europe and the United States were plummeting because of fears
about the financial turmoil in Russia and other emerging markets.
That stymied traders who had taken short positions on shares and
futures contracts on the bet that the Hong Kong market would
tumble.
</P>
<P>
   For Hong Kong, Friday's action was the boldest step yet in a
costly effort to erect a wall between this former British colony
and the financial typhoon raging around it. Although Hong Kong has
already been whipsawed by the Asian crisis, the territory's leaders
are determined not to be sucked into an even more calamitous vortex
of currency attacks followed by a stock market collapse.
</P>
<P>
   The Hong Kong Monetary Authority has spent at least $12 billion
since it began buying shares and futures contracts on Aug. 14.
Nonetheless, Donald Tsang, Hong Kong's financial secretary, said
the government was ready to continue intervening. Hong Kong has
already spent more than 10 percent of its $100 billion in foreign
reserves on the effort.
</P>
<P>
   Tung Chee-hwa, the chief executive of Hong Kong, held open the
possibility that China might support Hong Kong's campaign, with its
$140 billion worth of reserves. ``The central government has said
many, many times openly that they are very willing to support us if
there is a need to do so,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong's tough stance came in the wake of more bad economic
news. The government released data confirming that Hong Kong had
slipped into a recession in the second quarter, as the economy
contracted 5 percent. It also projected that the economy would
shrink 4 percent in 1998 _ the first full year of contraction since
Hong Kong began keeping records in 1961.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the government's intervention that had analysts
rattled. Several said the stock market would plummet as soon as the
government stopped supporting it. And some argued that Hong Kong
was squandering both its reserves and its reputation as the freest
financial market in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the short run, if you pour billions of dollars into stocks,
you can pump up the market,'' said Steve Hanke, a professor of
applied economics at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. ``But
in the long run, this is doomed to fail because it convinces
speculators that Hong Kong can't take the pain.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, no less prominent a currency trader than George Soros
seems to view Hong Kong's intervention as a quixotic effort.
Stanley Druckenmiller, the manager of Soros' Quantum Fund, said in
an interview on Thursday with CNBC: ``No matter what they do in
their market, when they wake up on Monday morning, they're still
going to be in a depression.''
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong may not stop at simple intervention. Tsang announced
that the government was considering measures to curb ``manipulative
practices.'' These could include restrictions on the short-selling
of stocks and increased disclosure requirements in the trading of
index futures.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong would not be the first Asian market to restrict
certain kinds of trading. Japan, Korea and Malaysia all do it, just
as they intervene in their markets. But Hong Kong has long prided
itself as the New York of Asia _ a market where Wall Street
openness meets Chinese entrepreneurialism.
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, some analysts believe the government has been
forced to act by Hong Kong's most prominent entrepreneurs _ the
property tycoons _ who have seen their share holdings decline in
value by 50 percent since last year. Two months ago, the government
announced it would suspend sales of land, in an effort to halt the
downward spiral of property prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``The irony is that the government is taking the people's money
and using it to bail out the property developers,'' said Marc
Faber, an investment adviser and managing director of his own
brokerage firm.
</P>
<P>
   Tsang dismissed the suggestion that the government was putting
Hong Kong's reserves at risk. He noted that the Hang Seng index has
risen 1,200 points since the intervention began, which means that
the government owns more in shares than it did in cash before it
began buying.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the government's buying spree has put it in the
uncharacteristic _ and potentially awkward _ position of being a
major shareholder in many blue-chip Hong Kong companies. The
government now even owns a stake in HSBC Holdings, the parent
company of the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank. Traders said that one of
HSBC's brokerage subsidiaries was buying shares on behalf of the
government, raising questions about a conflict of interest.
</P>
<P>
   Tsang said he was not concerned about owning large stakes in
Hong Kong companies or about the potential negative effect of
dumping those positions on the open market once the intervention
was over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am quite happy to hold on to them for quite a while,'' Tsang
said. ``These are the assets of the Hong Kong people.''
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong's battle with the currency traders has mutated from a
guerrilla skirmish into a full-scale war of attrition. Several
traders said the government had recruited an unidentified expert to
help it plot moves to thwart even the shrewdest of hedge funds.
Beyond buying blue-chip shares like HSBC and Hong Kong Telecom, the
government has taken a complex set of long and short positions on
August and September index futures contracts. The goal has been to
put the traders who hold the contracts into a bind: They can either
sell their August contracts at a loss, or roll them over into
September at a discount.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the mechanics of the market, Hong Kong's intervention has
rekindled a debate about how much governments can and should
intervene to protect themselves from the vagaries of the global
marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   Ronnie Chan, a prominent Hong Kong property developer, said the
government had an obligation to protect its citizens from a wave of
speculation that was threatening to swamp the stock market and the
local economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The total annual output of Hong Kong is dwarfed by the daily
capital flow of the markets,'' Chan said. ``At will, the market can
destroy an economy overnight. Is Hong Kong being destroyed? No. But
is it suffering hugely? You bet.''
</P>
<P>
   In Hong Kong's case, however, the debate is complicated by the
fact that it has set itself up as a mecca for global capital. Last
year, the Hang Seng index rocketed to 16,000 points as foreign
investors poured money into shares of ``red chips'' _ Chinese
companies with publicly listed Hong Kong subsidiaries.
</P>
<P>
   The Hong Kong dollar is another example of the territory's
supposed openness to the global economy. The currency is pegged to
the U.S. dollar at a fixed rate. The price for preserving that link
at a time when most Asian countries devalued their currencies has
been a spike in interest rates, which drove down property prices
and the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Until this summer, Hong Kong had seemed ready to absorb those
blows. But then in June, the government announced it would stop
selling land. And two weeks ago, it waded into the stock market.
After Friday's session, some market experts began talking about the
``nationalization'' of Hong Kong.

CLINTON REMARKS CENTER ON FORGIVENESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAK BLUFFS, Mass. _ Embraced by his most ardent supporters, an
emotional President Clinton said Friday that he had been wrestling
with the process of forgiveness _ both as a seeker of forgiveness
from his family and the nation, and as one who forgives his
enemies.
</P>
<P>
   ``And so it is important that we are able to forgive those we
believe have wronged us, even as we ask for forgiveness from people
we have wronged,''the president said in apparent references first
to Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel who has been delving into
the Clintons' lives, and then to his wife and the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The anger, the resentment, the bitterness, the desire for
recrimination against people you believe have wronged you _ they
harden the heart and deaden the spirit and lead to self-inflicted
wounds,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The remarks came almost two weeks after he spoke in a televised
address to the country about his relationship with former White
House intern Monica Lewinsky. In the days that followed the brief
address, Clinton was widely criticized as less contrite than he
should have been and too eager to cast blame for his predicament on
Starr. Since then, aides have hinted he might make a more
conciliatory statement.
</P>
<P>
   If Friday's words did not constitute the outright apology that
some critics have been demanding, they reflected a man who is still
navigating his way through the self-imposed crisis that has tested
his marriage and threatened his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was speaking to 400 people who had come to a simple
wood-shingled chapel here to commemorate the 35th anniversary of
the historic civil-rights march on Washington.
</P>
<P>
   His aides, who have said Clinton would refer publicly to his
personal situation in his own time and way, said they had no idea
he would offer up this fillip on forgiveness Friday, and they
refused to interpret it. But they said that Friday morning he
rejected a speech written by his staff, turning over the very paper
the prepared speech was written on and scribbling his own thoughts
in long hand.
</P>
<P>
   He continued to revise his remarks in his car on the way to the
chapel Friday afternoon and jotted even more as he sat on stage,
where he was bathed in an emotional outpouring of support from
black leaders, who have been his most reliable supporters. The most
recent New York Times/CBS News Poll, conducted Aug. 19 and 20,
showed that 94 percent of blacks approve of the job he is doing,
compared with 60 percent of whites.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been with you from the beginning,'' declared Rep. John
Lewis, D-Ga., who played a central role in the civil-rights
movement. ``And I will stand with you now till the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Ogletree Jr., a professor at Harvard Law School, said to
the president: ``All these times, it was very easy for us to be
with you because you were with us. And now in difficult times, I
want you to know that the people here understand and feel your
pain, believe in redemption and are here because of you and are
here with you through thick and through thin.''
</P>
<P>
   Ogletree represented Anita Hill, the former University of
Oklahoma law professor who once accused Supreme Court nominee
Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment. Ms. Hill also attended the
ceremony.

LATIN COUNTRIES HOPE TO AVOID RADICAL MARKET MEASURES 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also MARKET, JAPAN-ECON, HONGKONG-ECON, RUSSIA-BANKAMERICA) 
(mk) 
 By SAM DILLON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ The recent panic in world markets has weakened
Latin American currencies and drastically reduced the wealth of
many Latin corporations, raising prospects that governments in the
region may be forced to take Draconian measures to contain the
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Financial authorities in Brazil, Mexico and Argentina and other
nations have allowed interest rates to rise, spent billions of
dollars of reserves to support their currencies, and tinkered with
other limited steps. But, perhaps hoping that market calm will
eventually prevail, they have avoided more drastic steps like
aggressively squeezing cash out of circulation, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Latin countries are using their second-stage defenses,
hoping that these external shocks won't last very long,'' said Luis
R. Luis, a managing director at Scudder Kemper Investments in
Boston. ``They want to avoid having to impose really Draconian
monetary policies. But if this continues, they're really going to
have to jack up the interest rates.''
</P>
<P>
   Most Latin American markets got a breather Friday after a week
of panicked trading that saw foreign investors flee from the region
and local traders cash out of equities to buy dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican stocks, which have fallen by more than half in dollar
terms since the beginning of the year, rose 3.22 percent, with
confidence bolstered in part by a more modest rise in Brazil's
larger stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Argentina's benchmark index rose nearly 1 percent; the Chilean
and Peruvian exchanges were off only slightly. Venezuela, the sick
man of the region, was the exception _ its stock index plummeted
4.52 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But gloom among investors and business executives across Latin
America continued to deepen. Fears continue that the collapse of
the Russian ruble could play out again here, either with a
devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar or, in what would be far
worse, the Brazilian real.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the uncertainty was a belief that the International
Monetary Fund is short of cash and sitting on its hands, even
though several Latin countries are floundering. The fund has
invited Latin American finance ministers to meet next Thursday in
Washington to discuss joint responses, and Finance Minister Pedro
Malan of Brazil and Economy Minister Roque Fernandez of Argentina
have said they will attend. Mexico's treasury secretary, Jose Angel
Gurria, and several other Latin ministers have not yet announced
plans.
</P>
<P>
   But because the IMF, after financing rescue packages for Asian
nations and Russia, has less than $10 billion available for future
bailouts, its call for a meeting has aroused little hope.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts are starting to criticize what they see as a
listless reaction to the financial chaos in Latin America by the
Clinton administration, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. is keeping monetary policy tight enough to slow our
economy even though most developing economies sink,'' said David
Malpass, chief international economist at Bear, Stearns. ``I'm
still hopeful that the U.S. will become more engaged, to calm
things down, and allow Latin America a rebound.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the Asian crisis began last year, international investors
have become increasingly leery of all emerging markets. And last
week's financial collapse in Russia has led to a truly hemorrhagic
flight of capital out Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   In Caracas, Venezuela, where investors have been spooked by the
similarities between conditions in Russian and Venezuela's
oil-dependent and ill-managed economy, the stock market is off 66
percent for the year. The Mexican bolsa is down 40 percent, and if
losses from the declining peso are taken into account, Mexico's
markets are down 51 percent. Brazil's market is 34 percent lower,
Argentina's 47 percent and Chile's 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities in the three largest Latin economies have confronted
the crisis with relatively modest initial tactics, apparently
hesitating before taking more painful moves, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   In Mexico, where the currency floats freely, the peso has
dropped by 8.9 percent since the ruble devaluation, settling here
at 10.020 to the dollar and in New York at 10.005. Authorities have
attempted to slow the peso's decline by auctioning dollars, $200
million at a time, several times since the crisis began.
</P>
<P>
   The Banco de Mexico has also removed increasing amounts of
currency from circulation, as a way of indirectly raising interest
rates. On Wednesday, the central bank increased the reserve
requirements for commercial banks, a more forceful way of removing
cash from the economy. In response, interest rates have jumped from
22.0 to 27.2 percent for the 28-day Cetes notes which serve as a
reference.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Mexican rates are far below the 50 percent-plus levels
they reached in the wake of the 1994 peso devaluation, when
businesses were strangled and the economy plunged into a two-year
recession.
</P>
<P>
   In Brazil, where the real trades within a fixed band and is
under assault by speculators who consider it overvalued by more
than 10 percent, authorities have also been defending the currency.
But there, too, they have so far acted with less vigor than during,
for instance, the country's last crisis, a speculative attack on
the real last October.
</P>
<P>
   As in October, Brazilian authorities have freely sold off
foreign reserves to defend the real. So far this month, economists
estimate that some $8.5 billion of the country's 70 billion
reserves have been sold to prop up the real. And the authorities
have made it easier for Brazilians to borrow money abroad.
</P>
<P>
   But in contrast with last fall, the central bank has not yet
raised official interest rates from their current 19.75 percent
during the current crisis, although offshore rates, set by
commercial banks, have soared to 36 percent. Last fall, the
authorities in Brasilia raised official interest rates from 20 to
41 percent to defend the real.
</P>
<P>
   The tactics in Brasilia are being watched closely in Buenos
Aires. ``The largest risk for Argentina is that the next victim
could be Brazil,'' said Luis Secco, an economist at the Estudio
Broda consulting firm in Buenos Aires.
</P>
<P>
   Argentina's peso is freely convertible with the dollar, and the
central bank has $23.7 billion in reserves. So far, the Argentine
authorities have made no changes in policy to react to the crisis,
Secco said. ``Our authorities are viewing this calmly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The opposite is true in Venezuela, where economists estimate
that the bolivar may be overvalued by at least 30 percent and the
budget deficit has balooned as oil revenues have plunged this year.
Authorities have made deep spending cuts, allowed interest rates to
soar above 100 percent, and last week sold off nearly $500 million
of the country's $14 billion in reserves. Nonetheless, fears of a
devaluation are increasing.

GINGRICH QUESTIONS CLINTON'S POLICY ON IRAQI ARMS INSPECTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JUDITH MILLER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Speaker Newt Gingrich said Friday that the
resignation of a senior American weapons inspector in Iraq raised
``disturbing questions'' about President Clinton's policy and
suggested that Clinton had misled Congress about his commitment to
uncovering the extent of Saddam Hussein's nuclear, chemical and
biological weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter he sent to Clinton on Thursday, Gingrich expressed
his ``deepest concern'' about charges by the inspector, William
Ritter, who resigned Wednesday in part to protest administration
policy and U.N. Security Council inaction on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich said Ritter's charges suggested that ``your
administration at every turn has undercut and hindered the ability
of the inspection team to do its job.''
</P>
<P>
   If true, Gingrich said, the allegations suggest that ``your
administration's tough rhetoric on Iraq has been a deception
masking a real policy of weakness and concession.''
</P>
<P>
   In the letter, Gingrich noted that Clinton had six months ago
``justifiably'' threatened military action against Saddam if he did
not give U.N. inspectors unfettered access to purported weapons
sites. He complained that Iraq's Aug. 3 refusal to do so had not
prompted the tough action promised, but only a ``weak response,''
specifically, letting ``the U.N. decide.'' The United Nations,
unfortunately, he added, had decided ``not to take firm action.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Gingrich wrote, the ``U.S. appears ready to give up
on inspections and to be satisfied with the maintenance of an
increasingly porous and ineffective sanctions regime.'' This, in
turn, raised a number of ``very disturbing questions,'' he added,
among them ``Has your administration misled Congress and the
American people on our actual policy towards Iraq?''
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview from Alaska, where Gingrich is fishing,
he said he was particularly troubled by Clinton's inaction and
Ritter's charges because they are ``virtually the opposite of what
he and his people have been telling us for months.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The contradiction between Clinton's tough rhetoric and his
apparent inaction, Gingrich said, suggest ``a level of
disinformation that would be startling.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich said he was particularly troubled by assertions that
the United States is unwilling to challenge Iraqi defiance, because
``I know that the president is very concerned about the spread of
weapons of mass destruction,'' and with Iraq's role in such
proliferation. ``We've spent a lot of time talking about this.''
</P>
<P>
   While Gingrich did not say where, when, or how often Clinton and
he had discussed these issues, a spokesman for the speaker's office
said that Gingrich and Clinton had regular telephone conversations.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich said that within the last two months, Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright had given Congress information that turned
out not to be true. When challenged about what appeared to be the
misinformation, he said, senior administration officials told
Gingrich that Albright ``had not been briefed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You just have to ask, `what is going on here'?'' he said.
``Have the people at State been running their own independent
policy of appeasement?''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich would not disclose what Albright had discussed with him
and other senior members of Congress, except to say that it
involved very sensitive information.
</P>
<P>
   The secretary's office did not return calls for comment, but
Gingrich called back Friday evening to say that Albright had
tracked him down to assure him that the administration was not
softening its stance on Iraq and that there was no rift in policy
toward Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich added that ``We've still got to explore this. The issue
will not go away.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich asked Clinton to assure him that the administration
would not allow Iraq to defy inspectors and return to developing a
significant arsenal of biological, chemical and nuclear weapons.
Backing down from the confrontation with Iraq, he added, would
``destroy our credibility in the international community and have
devastating consequences,'' he wrote.

LOOKING FOR PERFECTION? DON'T LOOK TOO CLOSELY 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 (bl)  
 By PETER H. LEWIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For people who have more money than space, flat-panel displays
sound almost too good to be true. Naturally, there is a catch or
two, or six or seven, said Raymond Soneira, creator of the popular
Displaymate utility program that helps both manufacturers and users
get optimum performance from their monitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are quirkier,'' Soneira said of the flat-panel monitors,
which have a liquid crystal display (LCD). The flat-panel screens
require more adjustments to achieve the best picture, and even then
they may exhibit odd and perplexing behaviors that would be
unacceptable in displays of cathode-ray tubes, or CRTs.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine being in a football stadium and trying to get hundreds
of fans to align themselves perfectly and to flip an assortment of
colored cards precisely on cue all day long. Multiplied by
thousands, that is the daunting challenge of the transistors that
drive the picture elements (pixels) on an LCD monitor.
</P>
<P>
   Some customers cling to the belief that paying such a high
premium for a monitor should guarantee perfection. Alas, many
dealers have a more relaxed definition of perfection.
</P>
<P>
   LCD panels typically have one or more bad pixels, including some
that are stuck annoyingly in either the ``on'' or ``off'' position.
Laptop computer screens often have similar freckles.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to popular wisdom, LCD monitors do in fact flicker,
Soneira said. But the flicker is much less noticeable than with
CRTs, so people who stare into a computer screen for most of the
day generally report less eye fatigue with LCDs. This, besides
space saving, is one of the prime benefits of flat-panel monitors.
Also, on a properly tuned LCD monitor, smaller text is more
readable.
</P>
<P>
   Early LCD monitors, besides being wildly expensive, were
technically finicky. Viewing angles were narrow, meaning the user
had to align his eyeballs almost precisely at the center of the
screen to see images at their best. Straying to the side, or up and
down, even by a few inches, made images change color, become
distorted or lose contrast.
</P>
<P>
   The newest LCD monitors, specifically the type known as TFT
(Thin Film Transistor), like those used for laptops _ are much
better, although every one we tested showed some degree of color
shift as a result either of a change in viewing angle or of
variations in lighting across the screen. In terms of retaining
contrast at wider viewing angles, though, newer LCD displays are
comparable to CRTs.
</P>
<P>
   Lighting is a crucial distinction between LCD and CRT monitors.
The cathode-ray tube generates its own brightness across the screen
as electrons excite layers of phosphors and cause them to glow. But
LCD screens are illuminated only by a background light that
typically runs around the perimeter of the screen. These
fluorescent backlights are known to dim and darken over time.
</P>
<P>
   Because LCD desktop monitors are still new, one can only
speculate on the life span of the screen. Manufacturers are coy
when asked about it, and concede that no one really knows whether
it will be practical to replace fading backlights.
</P>
<P>
   LCD monitors have only one optimum, or native, resolution. CRT
displays, in contrast, typically can switch among several standard
resolutions. Problems often arise when the LCD monitor tries to
display a non-native resolution, resulting in poor image quality.
</P>
<P>
   Some LCD models _ not all _ offer high native resolutions (up to
1,280 by 1,024 pixels) and colors (16.7 million shades) that rival
their sumo-size counterparts. Of the half-dozen flat-panel monitors
tested for this article, however, none could display large areas of
black reliably. While colors are quite good, they often lack the
richness, or saturation, of CRT displays.
</P>
<P>
   Some LCD screens also have slower response times than most CRTs,
Soneira said, which can lead to disappearing cursors when the mouse
is moved quickly, or substandard, jerky performance when
full-motion video images are displayed. However, we found no
problems when playing DVD movies on the screens.
</P>

   The Displaymate software for Windows has a list price of $79.

JACKSON TO MEET WITH CONDIT TO DISCUSS RACE RELATIONS AT BOEING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BRUCE RAMSEY and CONSTANCE SOMMER  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Boeing Chairman Phil Condit will meet with the Rev. Jesse
Jackson in Seattle next Friday to discuss race relations at Boeing,
a company spokesman said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement to meet comes one month after the
affirmative-action advocate sent a letter to Condit asking for an
end to racial discrimination at Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson has taken a hand in other discrimination cases,
including a case at Texaco that involved a tape of a company
officer talking about ``black jelly beans.'' In 1996, Texaco
settled that case for $115 million in cash payments to
African-American employees and ex-employes, $26 million in raises
over five years and $35 million in sensitivity and diversity
training.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's focus is now Boeing. In his letter, he expressed
concern about accusations of racial bias and retaliation detailed
in several employee lawsuits, including a federal class action
filed in Seattle earlier this year, a separate group case filed in
King County Superior Court, and a 1997 federal case filed by a
manager in Boeing's Security Investigations Department. The latter
case, brought by Jesse Jones, is scheduled to go to trial Sept. 15.
</P>
<P>
   Condit responded to Jackson's letter in early August, saying he
would like to get together and suggesting they attempt to set up a
time, said Boeing spokesman Larry McCracken. But the two men did
not agree on a time until Jackson took his case public Friday,
complaining that Boeing had failed to come up with a date.
</P>
<P>
   Condit called Jackson that same day, McCracken said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had a conversation about 10 minutes long,'' he said.
``(Condit) took the initiative of calling because he wanted to
assure (Jackson) that there was no misunderstanding and that they
are interested in the same goals.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said he would be in the Seattle area next Friday, and
Condit agreed to clear his afternoon schedule, McCracken said. The
details of when and where the meeting will take place and who will
attend are still being worked out. Jackson has also asked to tour a
Boeing facility, McCracken said.
</P>
<P>
   In his letter, Jackson asked Condit for data on Boeing's hiring
and promotion practices. McCracken said he did not know if Boeing
could provide it. But he said the company welcomes Jackson's
requests.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are committed to the same things _ equality of opportunity
and fair treatment of all Boeing employees,'' he said. ``We agree
inclusion leads to growth and where there is growth, everybody
wins.''
</P>
<P>
   Boeing may not be perfect, but neither is it complacent, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are making every effort,'' he said. ``As a company ... we
probably have a lot of the same problems society has.''

 &HT;    All rain makes for dull vacation
 &HT;    By Marlon Manuel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, N.C. _ At the halfway point of a two-week vacation
with his wife and two sons, accountant Geoff Meyers has entertained
his family the past three days by looking at areas flooded by
Hurricane Bonnie and watching the rain fall outside their hotel
window.
</P>
<P>
   It's not exactly the fishing trip or long bike rides they had
planned for the Outer Banks. Meyers was among thousands of tourists
evacuated from coastal North Carolina in advance of Bonnie on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   With blue sky emerging around them Friday for the first time
since Tuesday, Meyers hoped to get back to the fishing village of
Avon, N.C., in the middle of Outer Banks.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as they open the highway, we're gone,'' said Meyers of
Gardiner, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Parts of N.C. 12 on the Outer Banks were closed until Friday,
when residents began streaming back onto the barrier islands.
Between Rodanthe and Frisco on the Outer Banks, soundside flooding
began as ocean overwash subsided. Most of N.C. 12 south of Oregon
inlet was reported under 10 to 12 inches of water early Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Closed highways make for boring vacations. Entertainment for
10-year-old Devin and 4-year-old Trevor was limited. Nintendo games
held their attention for only so long before they were practically
bouncing off the walls at the Comfort Inn.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing to do here,'' Meyers said.
</P>
<P>
   Meyers stowed his fishing tackle in a luggage shell on top of
his Ford Aerostar and made sure the fiberglass carrier was strapped
down each night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had it all unpacked Saturday, and we spent (Tuesday)
packing it back up,'' said Meyers, an accountant who had a deep-sea
fishing trip postponed by Bonnie.
</P>
<P>
   Devin was disappointed the fishing trip was postponed while the
family waited out the storm. ``He was a little nervous, but he's
also a little excited because of the hurricane,'' Meyers said.
</P>
<P>
   Meyers' father, 74-year-old Howard Meyers, stayed behind and
successfully rode out the storm. ``He just battened everything
down. He's been through them,'' Meyers said.

 &HT;    Life without eyes
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Her water broke on the evening before, and Lori and
Brad Hardy waited through the night as gradually the contractions
became more frequent, more intense. It would be a boy _ they knew
that much. On the ultrasound examination, the doctor had spotted
the boy parts and told them it was all but certain. Both were
happy. Just so he was healthy.
</P>
<P>
   By 8 the morning of Sept. 7, 1995, her hard labor was under way.
It lasted for 2 1/2 hours, and at 10:19 Lori Hardy, 22, gave birth
to their first child, David Tyler Hardy. They would call him by his
middle name.
</P>
<P>
   A mother's reward for her labor is usually to hold her newborn
to her breast, but it is not always immediate. In Lori Hardy's
case, the nurses were having a hard time getting the infant's
eyelids open, and when nothing seemed to work, Tyler was taken off
to be examined by a specialist.
</P>
<P>
   But the waiting and expectation and morning sickness were over.
He had entered the world, 6 pounds, 13 ounces, and was breathing on
his own.
</P>
<P>
   It was another two hours before a doctor returned to Lori
Hardy's hospital room and told her, ``As for eyes, he doesn't have
any.''
</P>
<P>
   She lay there, in the company of her family and her husband's
family, all of them gathered in Birmingham for the birth, and a
doctor was telling her that the child she carried for nine months
had been born without eyes.
</P>
<P>
   And then the doctor said, ``Now, we're going to do some tests to
make sure nothing else is wrong.'' When a child is born without
eyes, he explained, there often are other problems as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad, who's always been the emotional one, just broke down
crying,'' Lori Hardy says. ``He had to leave the room.''
</P>
<P>
   His weren't the only tears. But Brad Hardy, 25, put his aside
and told the unbelieving, grief-stricken family that it wasn't a
time to dwell on misfortune. Their son needed their strength and
support, he said, and he and his wife were going to provide him a
life as close to normal as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Learning by touch
</P>
<P>
   The building at 763 Peachtree St. has a storefront appearance.
Inside, the paint on the wall tells you things operate on a small
budget. From his second floor office at the Center for the Visually
Impaired, Scott McCall administers programs that last year served
1,460 clients. Some were a few days old, others were aged. Many hav
</P>
<P>
   e limited vision, others have severely impaired vision, still
others have no vision at all _ what one instructor calls ``lights
out.''
</P>
<P>
   McCall is among the latter, an Americus native, 50 years old,
married to a sighted woman. He earned a bachelor's degree in
psychology from Mercer University and a master's degree in
rehabilitative counseling from the University of Georgia. At his
desk, he works on a Braille laptop computer, which he says is
subject to crashing like any other. He lives a life almost like any
other _ not in every single respect but in the essential ones of
knowing he can learn, make a living, participate in his community.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you think about the things you did today,'' he says, ``from
the time the alarm went off and you looked at the clock to see if
maybe you could sleep another 10 minutes, from going to the closet
to see what tie you were going to wear with this or that shirt,
from shaving and showering to fixing breakfast and going to the
MARTA _ all those are things that most people take for granted.''
</P>
<P>
   They are things the blind, and many with visual impairment, do
at an obvious disadvantage _ but must learn to do nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our focus here,'' McCall says, ``is to provide them with the
skills to achieve two things _ independence and dignity.
Independence comes from acquiring the skills to travel, to read, to
cook and maintain a home, to use a computer, to do most of the
things other people do. Dignity comes from the kind of attitudes
people develop toward their blindness or visual impairment.''
</P>
<P>
   The center _ a not-for-profit corporation that receives both
private and public funds _ is almost 50 miles from the Hardys' home
in Canton, and Lori and Tyler make the drive once a week. ``I know
he wouldn't be where he is today if it weren't for that place,''
she says.
</P>
<P>
   In classes that last most of the morning, Tyler Hardy joins five
children who have varying degrees of visual impairment. He is the
only one completely without vision. With his classmates, he learns
to find his way around a room, to identify objects by their shape
and feel and to manipulate what he cannot see. Children who are
blind see with fingers that fly over surfaces, the tactile sense
transmitting information to the brain.
</P>
<P>
   And they must learn things the rest of us might assume children
do naturally. ``Children with visual impairment have to be taught
how to play,'' says Anne McComiskey, director of the center's
program for babies, toddlers and young children. ``It's not
something they just do on their own.''
</P>
<P>
   Her words stop you short. The spontaneity of child's play
wouldn't seem like something that could be carved into step-by-step
lessons, but then you realize your own unthinking assumptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ninety percent of early development is vision-related,''
McComiskey says. ``Children learn to play by watching others
play.'' They imitate, improvise, invent.
</P>
<P>
   But children who are blind or whose vision is seriously impaired
do what McComiskey calls ``stilling.'' When sighted infants, for
example, are on the floor and a sibling runs by, they'll turn their
head to follow what they saw. It registers in their mind. Ideas are
formed. With everything it sees, the infant's relationship to his
surroundings and to others becomes clear.
</P>
<P>
   A blind child, when a sibling runs by, doesn't turn its head to
follow what it's heard. It is alert, head tensed, but still.
``Nothing is being strengthened,'' McComiskey says.
</P>
<P>
   And so, in class at the Center for the Visually Impaired, Joyce
Burnett, Kathy Chappell and other instructors teach them first what
blocks are and then how blocks can be played with. They teach them
to form circles, each holding the hand of another. They teach them
to stand in single file, and they teach them to sing in harmony.
</P>
<P>
   But the main thing they teach them is how to learn by touch. The
shape and feel of something are part of knowing what it is. They
also learn to know where they are and where they are going. Using
walkers, students negotiate a path from one side of the room to
another.
</P>
<P>
   The underlying assumption is ``doing things differently,'' not
physical handicap. ``Our philosophy is that blindness is a pain in
the butt, not a life-stopping crisis,'' McComiskey says. There's
even a small computer in the room, and that, too, is part of their
preschool play. By learning to recognize the clicks and sounds,
they come to know that computers are part of the world in which
they will be living.
</P>
<P>
   Parents set goals high
</P>
<P>
   Scott McCall had nothing like the Center for the Visually
Impaired to attend when he was stricken with optic glaucoma at 6
months and lost his sight. But he had his parents. He calls them
his heroes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The expectations they set for me were no different from those
they set for my brothers and sisters,'' he says. ``They taught me
that blindness was something that required me to do things
differently, but didn't define my character.''
</P>
<P>
   And neither did it prevent him from understanding the world
around him. One day, when McCall was about 8, his father took him
to a baseball field. They started at home plate. Reach down and
feel it, Bill McCall told the boy, and he did. From home plate they
walked the 90 feet to first base. The boy crouched and felt the
square bag, something like a pillow but coarse to the touch. And
then, making a right angle turn, 90 feet more. This was second
base. Another turn, another 90 feet. Third base. Back to home
plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember it like it was yesterday,'' McCall says. ``To see
it, I had to get down and feel it. And my father said, `Now, over
there is where foul balls go and over here is where fair balls
go.'''
</P>
<P>
   Today, he watches Braves games on TV with his wife, with friends
``or just by myself'' and goes to an occasional game at Turner
Field. ``If we're watching a game on TV and Skip Caray says there's
a hard grounder to short, I know what's going on.'' The game is
being played in his mind.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't like to think he's an exception to anyone's rule.
``As a society,'' he says, ``we haven't had the same expectations
of the blind. That leads to the blind not expecting much of
themselves. So, that's why I say our goal at the center is twofold
_ independence and dignity.''
</P>
<P>
   `A special little boy'
</P>
<P>
   The Hardys might not have found the center if not for Lori's
sister, Leeann Harrington. After Tyler's birth, Harrington set
about researching services for the blind. When she learned about
the Center for the Visually Impaired, the Hardys moved from
Birmingham back to Georgia, where most of their family were living.
Brad was able to transfer from a Home Depot store in Birmingham to
one in Woodstock.
</P>
<P>
   In Birmingham, a doctor had told the Hardys nothing much could
be done for Tyler in his first three years. Until then, take him
home and enjoy him, Lori Hardy remembers being told. To the
contrary, much needed to be done if Tyler were to live a productive
life one day. The painful part was surgery to enable doctors to fit
prosthetic eyes into his sockets. As he grew older, the bones in
his skull grew, and he needed repeated surgery. Over a 30-month
period he underwent 17 operations, and soon the electronic beeps
and the lifting feel of an elevator in a medical building became
signals that he was in for more pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd take him to the doctor's and as soon as we'd get on the
elevator, he'd start to cry,'' Lori Hardy says.
</P>
<P>
   His younger sister Tatum, born 15 months later, learned early on
that her brother is blind and accepts it as part of who he is.
``She'd see him come home from the hospital and his eyes would be
red and swollen'' Lori Hardy says. ``She asked me why, and I told
her. She just picked it up.''
</P>
<P>
   A couple of weeks shy of his third birthday, Tyler weighs 29
pounds and stands a few inches more than 3 feet. At home he often
talks of Miss Kathy _ Kathy Chappell, his orientation teacher, at
the center. By the time he's 6, he will be enrolled in a public
school, like other 6-year-olds. ``The thing we don't want is for
him to be treated differently just because he's blind,'' says Brad
Hardy.
</P>
<P>
   The additional tests that the doctor in Birmingham performed
turned up nothing abnormal. Tyler was born with what doctors call a
genetic mistake, a one-in-a-million chance.
</P>
<P>
   But he wasn't denied life, and Brad and Lori Hardy, like all
parents, are intent that he make the most of it.
</P>
<P>
   Tyler himself has reached the age that he realizes it will be a
life lived differently. One morning this summer Lori Hardy was
swinging him in the hammock and Tyler, ``out of nowhere, said,
`Mommy, I can't see.'''
</P>
<P>
   He had never said it before.
</P>
<P>
   ``It caught me off-guard,'' his mother says. ``He had this sad,
pitiful voice. Later that night, I cried. But I just said to him,
`It's OK, it's OK. You're a special little boy and you can do a lot
of other things.' And he will.''
</P>
<P>
   She went back to swinging her son under the blue summer sky.

FED'S FOCUS SAID TO BE SHIFTING ON INTEREST RATES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wyo., Kan., Mo.)  (lb) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSON HOLE, Wyo. _ The latest round of global financial
turmoil is forcing the Federal Reserve Board to shift its sights
from guarding against inflation through higher interest rates to
the possibility that it might have to reduce rates to head off an
economic downturn, central bank officials and economists said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Although it has left rates unchanged for nearly a year and a
half, the Fed has consistently seen inflation, stemming from strong
growth and low unemployment, as a greater threat than recession at
home or a financial meltdown around the world.
</P>
<P>
   But the stock market's slide and the continued deterioration of
most developing economies _ both of which accelerated this week
amid Russia's crisis _ mean that the Fed will almost certainly not
raise rates anytime soon and may seriously debate cutting rates in
coming months, officials and economists said.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, made no
substantive statements about the markets or monetary policy during
a presentation he made here Friday on income inequality. But Fed
officials, as well as economists who held informal discussions with
them here during a symposium sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank
of Kansas City, said events of the last several weeks will
inevitably reshape the debate within the Fed's policy-making
committee.
</P>
<P>
   One indication of the change in thinking came from William
Poole, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, who
earlier this year was pushing for a rate increase. At the beginning
of July, Poole dropped his call for a rate increase, and he told
reporters here Friday that the best option for the Fed now is to
wait and see how much the domestic economy is hurt by what is
happening in the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given what's been going on in the markets, there is more
reason than before to wait and see how things play out,'' Poole
told the Reuters news service.
</P>
<P>
   Economists said, though, that any backing away from raising
rates would still leave the Fed a long way from cutting them.
``Clearly the events of the past few days make easing by the end of
the year a possibility, though I wouldn't put it higher than 50
percent,'' said David Hale, chief economist at Scudder Kemper
Investments.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Blinder, a former Fed vice chairman, said the fallout from
the situation in Russia ``can only push the spectrum of the debate
in the dovish direction,'' but he said the most likely course was
that the Fed would hold rates steady unless Wall Street was plunged
into a crisis.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as its policy-making meeting on July 1, most Fed
officials ``felt that the risks continued to point on balance
toward rising inflation,'' according to minutes of the meeting
released last week. At that meeting, the Fed voted to keep a formal
policy tilt toward raising rates. Minutes of the Fed's most recent
meeting, on Aug. 18, will be released after the next Fed meeting,
on Sept. 29.
</P>
<P>
   But with economic and financial conditions worsening, some Fed
officials suggested that their assessments of the outlook were
changing. The selloff in the stock market, they said, could be
expected to help rein in demand as consumers grew less confident
about their finances, slowing the economy.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Financial-market weakness will only underscore expectations of
weakened growth and reassure policy-makers of the remoteness of
inflation as a risk,'' said John Lipsky, chief economist at Chase
Manhattan Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the market reaction to Russia's woes has effectively
brought about a severe tightening of credit conditions for nearly
all developing nations, as investors are demanding sharply higher
premiums over safe investments like U.S. Treasury bonds before they
put their money just about anywhere outside the United States and
Western Europe. Many investors suffered heavy losses in Russia and
are wary of taking another hit.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of credit and investment capital, as well as the
continued turmoil in the markets, could bring a further slowdown to
regions like South America and put further pressure on important
economies like that of Hong Kong, where officials are battling to
stem a sharp slide in the stock market and pressures for a
devaluation of the currency.
</P>
<P>
   The implications for the United States of mounting problems in
other countries, even apart from the effect the turmoil is having
on the financial markets, could be considerable. Mexico and South
America together, for example, account for nearly 20 percent of
U.S. trade, and a downturn there could have a pronounced impact on
U.S. jobs and corporate profits.
</P>
<P>
   But Fed officials said they were by no means convinced that the
economy would stall or even slow to a noninflationary pace.
Although growth slowed to 1.6 percent in the second quarter after
surging to a 5.4 percent annual rate in the first quarter, one Fed
official noted that the average for the first half, at 3.4 percent,
was still quite strong.
</P>
<P>
   With unemployment remaining extremely low, there are also
tentative signs that wage increases are beginning to bite into
corporate profits, putting pressure on companies to raise prices
and set off an inflationary spiral.
</P>
<P>
   There was widespread agreement among the experts here that one
thing monetary policy in the United States could not do was help
Russia in any meaningful way. The loss of confidence in Russia
among international investors is so profound that it will take
wholesale changes in the country's political and economic climate
to woo them back, in this view.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Corrigan, a managing director of Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co.,
said Russia's best course would be to make up for its mistake in
unilaterally limiting its debt repayments and try to negotiate an
agreement with its creditors as a first step toward restoring
stability and credibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia, and Russia alone, must take the first steps to get
this process back on track,'' Corrigan said.
</P>
<P>
   But other economists said a rate cut could help economies like
Hong Kong's, where the currency is tied directly to the value of
the dollar and would therefore benefit from any reduction in dollar
interest rates, and those in South America, which need robust
demand from the United States to avert deep downturns.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Adding to the list of American companies battered by economic
turmoil in Russia, three more large banks reported trading losses
there, but provided mixed signals about whether financial downturns
elsewhere in the world might lead to more widespread losses.
</P>
<P>
   As the Russian crisis deepens, volatility in more economically
significant countries like Brazil and Argentina is also eating into
the profits of some financial concerns doing business there. Some
analysts say that there is now ample evidence that the current raft
of financial problems extends far beyond Russia's toppling economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the most important issue _ that markets are starting to
overrun governments' abilities to contain them in many parts of the
world _ and nobody wants to talk about them because it's a
confidence game of sorts,'' said Charles Peabody, an analyst with
Mitchell Securities Inc. in New York. ``Banks and businesses don't
want to create uncertainty that causes people not to repay one
another.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, some analysts said they have yet to see signs indicating
that serious losses will surface elsewhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market's concern and what Moody's is concerned about is
exposures in places like Latin America,'' said Gregory Bauer, a
managing director and banking analyst with Moody's Investors
Service in New York. ``The banks are well positioned now to deal
with potential losses.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the debris from errant trading is piling up.
</P>
<P>
   BankAmerica, the fifth-largest bank in the United States, said
Friday that it had trading losses of $220 million on a pre-tax
basis over the last two months, largely due to soured trades in
Russia. Given reports earlier this week of other companies' losses
in Russia, many analysts and investors had been bracing themselves
for BankAmerica to report a similar loss, so the figure did not
come as a complete surprise.
</P>
<P>
   But BankBoston, the 17th-largest bank in the country, announced
a $30 million pre-tax trading loss, only $10 million of which was
related to Russia. Most of the rest of the figure was due to
trading losses in Brazil and Argentina, according to the bank.
</P>
<P>
   Although BankBoston is not in the top tier of large American
money center banks doing business abroad, it has one of the oldest
and largest U.S. banking franchises in South America and is
something of a proxy for conditions there. And the announcement of
its trading losses is the first solid indication this week that
American firms may start to take hits in that region.
</P>
<P>
   Yet J.P. Morgan, the nation's fourth-largest bank, Friday
offered a glimpse of its trading activities, appearing to indicate
that its vaunted trading house may be faring well. Morgan is an
even more important bellweather for the well-being of emerging
markets than BankBoston, since it is one of the world's premier
bond traders and underwriters in those regions.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan announced in a press release Friday that its exposure in
Russia was $160 million, well below the exposure of $400 million
that analysts believed the bank had. A Morgan spokesman said that
the $160 million figure was the result of trading losses the bank
incurred in Russia, but declined to specify the size of the losses
or what the bank's exposure was before the losses occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan said that its trading revenue so far during the current
quarter is $300 million, which includes ``losses from write-downs
of Russian trading assets, partially offset by gains in other
emerging markets, and lower revenues from trading activities in
developed markets.'' Morgan's trading revenue is on track to fall
well short of the $920 million it hauled in last quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's news follows disclosures of big Russian trading losses
this week by Credit Suisse First Boston, Republic New York Corp.,
and speculator George Soros' group of hedge funds.
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, investors punished BankAmerica and BankBoston for
their trading losses. Shares of BankAmerica fell $4.125, or 5.6
percent, to $69.625, while BankBoston's stock plunged $3, or 7.7
percent, to $36, a new 52-week low. J.P. Morgan, which released its
statement after the stock market closed, saw its shares beaten down
6.7 percent to $97.75.
</P>
<P>
   As has been the case all week, other bank stocks also suffered
Friday. Bankers Trust dropped 5.3 percent to $79.375; Citicorp fell
4 percent to $117.125, and Chase Manhattan fell 2.8 percent to
$56.50.
</P>
<P>
   Large U.S. banks have relatively little exposure in Russia given
their size _about $7.68 billion, according to Brown Brothers
Harriman &AMP; Co. By comparison, the largest American banks have $25.7
billion in exposure to Brazil, $17.3 billion to Mexico, and $16.2
billion to Argentina, according to Brown Brothers. And in Latin
America as a whole, the exposure is a whopping $98.9 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts pointed out that even if banks face mounting
losses around the globe, they are not the same companies that were
brought to their knees a decade ago by shoddy lending practices to
foreign governments and domestic real estate operators.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back in the '80s, these banks had less equity, less reserves,
and less earnings power than they do now,'' said James McDermott,
chief executive of Keefe Bruyette &AMP; Woods Inc., a bank research
firm in New York. ``Banks now have much more ability to withstand
pain. They may be exposed to earnings shortfalls, but this is not a
large, systemic economic threat.''
</P>
<P>
   BankAmerica said its exposure in Russia has been reduced to $100
million from $412 million on June 30, primarily because of the
trading setback. BankAmerica's Moscow operation has been plagued by
large accounting snafus. Recently, the bank was forced by what it
described as an ``accounting error'' to restate its exposure in
Russia at the end of the second quarter to $412 million from $668
million.

 &HT;    Investors waiting out stock woes
 &HT;    By Shelia M. Poole
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Hank Thomas has scaled the stock market's peaks and
fallen in its valleys before, so this week's turmoil hasn't shaken
the Stone Mountain investor's confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still ahead of where we were one year ago,'' said
Thomas, who owns several metro McDonald's franchises. ``I still
think we'll end up with a double-digit increase by the end of the
year.'' Despite the turmoil on Wall Street, which extended its
losses Friday, many investors appear ready to ride out the storm.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average lost an additional 114 points
Friday and is now 1,268 points, or 13.8 percent, below the July 17
record of 9,337.97. Stocks also were down around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Trading volume Friday was lower than it was the day before, when
more than 2 billion shares exchanged hands, only the second time in
U.S. market history.
</P>
<P>
   Investors continue to fear the vulnerability of corporate
profits to currency devaluations and economic problems in Asia,
Russia and emerging markets.
</P>
<P>
   Added Lovette Lindon, an operations manager at Evercare who says
she has $6,000 invested in the stock market: ``I take my lead from
the big players. If they start worrying about their big
investments, then I will worry about my small one.''

AMONG RUSSIAN-AMERICANS: CONCERN MIXED WITH RESIGNATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JIM YARDLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ She only arrived in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn, from
Moscow two weeks ago, but Natalia Kuznetsova has followed the
crisis at home by telephoning friends. She knows that the banks are
closed, that the stores are closed, that the ruble is practically
worthless. Her friends tell her they pass the days drinking vodka.
</P>
<P>
   But even as Ms. Kuznetsova in one breath compares daily life in
Russia to a war, in the next breath she smiles and shrugs at the
financial and political upheaval in Moscow that has rippled across
the world. She said she hoped to stay in the United States for a
year or longer, but the thought of returning home did not bother
her.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had the same situation five years ago, 10 years ago,'' said
Ms. Kuznetsova, 26, who spoke with the resignation of someone
considerably older. ``It's a normal situation in our country.''
</P>
<P>
   In Brighton Beach, the neighborhood that for two decades has
absorbed layer upon layer of emigrants from the old Soviet Union,
the news from Russia was greeted with alarm, but also with apathy.
For every person who rushed to wire money to relatives in Russia,
others claimed they couldn't care less about life there. People who
still own property there, or conduct business, stayed in close
contact with friends, monitoring the latest changes. And still
others considered the crisis about as realistic as the televised
Russian soap operas playing at some of the stores on Brighton Beach
Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great play by the government to get money from the
international financial system and to steal their money,'' scoffed
Gennady Grigorovich, a Ukrainian immigrant who has lived in
Brooklyn for 20 years and the owner of the Cafi Paris restaurant on
Coney Island Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   A few people at Cafi Volna on the Brighton Beach boardwalk
watched Boris Yeltsin announce Friday on Russian television that he
would remain as president until 2000. Not long after the speech,
the channel was quickly changed to the Weather Channel to follow a
more immediate problem, the path of Tropical Storm Bonnie.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to stay?'' asked Sopha Liebanov, manager of
Feminik, a women's clothing store a few blocks away on Brighton
Beach Avenue. ``I don't think so. It doesn't matter if it's Yeltsin
or Chernomyrdin. They stole all the money and put it in their
pockets. The people don't work, and everything is closed. They
expect credits from America.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Liebanov blamed those in Brighton Beach who shrugged off the
crisis, saying that many immigrants have lived in Brooklyn for so
long that they have forgotten the hardship of their old lives.
``The people don't understand,'' she said. ``They think, `It's so
far, so who cares?'''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Boris Talis, executive director of Brighton Beach District
Management Association, a coalition of local businesses, said
several Russians visiting the United States on business have rushed
back in the last two days as the fiscal crisis has deepened. As for
Brighton Beach merchants, Talis said the crisis has had ``no
effect, only morally. This is a sad story. Nobody knows what can
happen in the next three or four days.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexy Dementyev, a clerk at United Air and Parcel Service on
Coney Island Avenue, said that on Thursday customers wired a total
of about $10,000 to relatives in Russia and other former Soviet
states, a significant increase. But he also said that the money may
not be bringing much help.
</P>
<P>
   ``Western Union in some cities are paying in rubles,'' Dementyev
said. ``That's not very convenient because the exchange rate is not
too positive. Nevertheless, people are sending.''
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, Irena Chikantseva and her husband, Andrey
Ahramov, came to Brighton Beach from Moscow and opened a gift
store. They still own a four-bedroom apartment in downtown Moscow,
but they said they can no longer find anyone able to pay the $2,000
monthly rent. Besides the financial crisis, the couple say that
rising crime has kept the apartment empty; the last tenant moved
out because the building had no doorman. Now, the couple regularly
call friends and family in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Chikantseva's sister in Moscow, whose son is approaching
draft age, worries that the instability could lead to another war
like those in Chechnya and Afghanistan. Ahramov's mother lives in
Moscow, surviving on a pension, but he said she was not alarmed,
perhaps because crisis is nothing new to the older generation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody can fix the situation,'' Ahramov lamented.
</P>
<P>
   At a barber shop, a Russian barber waved off questions,
unimpressed with the latest crisis at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's life,'' he said. ``People suffer.''

IMF CHIEF BACKS RUSSIAN PREMIER ON AUSTERITY PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By LOUIS UCHITELLE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ International Monetary Fund managing director
Michel Camdessus threw his support Friday behind what he described
as the attempts of Russia's new acting prime minister, Viktor
Chernomyrdin, to resurrect an austerity plan for Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``He accepts the challenge,'' Camdessus said, in his first
public comment after a hastily arranged meeting with Chernomyrdin
in the Ukraine on Wednesday night. ``Mr. Chernomyrdin has told me
that he recognizes the validity'' of the IMF program for restoring
the Russian economy.
</P>
<P>
   Camdessus and his chief deputy, Stanley Fischer, also suggested,
at a news conference at IMF headquarters in Washington, that if the
Russia fails to embrace the fund's approach, then it would be
fruitless for the IMF for the major industrial nations to lend more
money to Russia to support its currency and economy.
</P>
<P>
   When the ruble began to slide in value earlier this month, ``we
had to decide how much further to go, once it was clear'' that
foreign lenders would no longer roll over short-term loans to
Russia, Fischer said. ``The IMF and its major shareholder decided
that it would take more resources than were available.'' The IMF's
major shareholder is the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Camdessus' remarks seemed clearly aimed at giving Chernomyrdin
public backing in his attempts to convince a racalcitrant
Parliament to reject ``populist'' inflationary policies in favor of
the the conditions the IMF has attached to a recent loan agreement.
The IMF is pushing Russia to move to a balanced budget, restrain
borrowing, and much improve its tax collections.
</P>
<P>
   Russian President Boris Yeltsin agreed to these terms in last
month and had received, in return, $4.8 billion in loans from the
IMF to support the ruble. Another $4.3 billion loan was promised
for late September, and this will be forthcoming, Camdessus said
Friday, but only if the Russia shows progress toward meeting the
IMF's conditions for the credits.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The loans are part of an agreement last month between Russia,
the IMF and other international lenders to provide more than $17
billion in additional loans over the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin ``indicated that he understood the severity,'' of
the financial crisis in his country, Camdessus said, ``and that the
Russian government was prepared to take the needed action in close
consultation with the political parties and Parliament.''
</P>
<P>
   A political uproar over the IMF's terms played a role in
Yeltsin's decision to sack his reformist prime minister, Sergei
Kiriyenko, last Sunday, and reappoint the more centrist
Chernomyrdin, who was the previous prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Camdessus and Fischer said they were operating in concert with
the seven largest industrial nations that are the IMF's major
contributors. Fischer had been quoted in German and British
newspapers in recent days as having criticized these nations for
failing to provide additional money to bail out Russia as several
of them had for Mexico in 1994, particularly the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But Friday, Fischer indicated that he had been misquoted. He
said, ``there was no disagreement between the fund managers and the
G-7''_ the United States and the six other largest industrial
nations _ ``that the resources needed were more than were available
to deal with the problem.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In a separate effort to reassure the financial markets, this
time about Latin America, Camdessus announced that the IMF had
invited the finance ministers and central bank chiefs of the
Western Hemisphere nations _ the United States and Canada included
_ to a meeting in Washington late next week. The meeting, the first
of its kind, would attempt to organize ``regional surveillance,''
in which the various nations help each other maintain
market-friendly economic policies.
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging that the IMF's available money, depleted by the
Asian and Russian crises, is unusually low, Camdessus insisted that
the IMF will not cut back its assistance programs. His remark
seemed aimed at getting the IMF's various member countries to come
through with an $85 billion infusion, including $18 billion from
the United States, an amount that the Clinton administration
favors, but many in Congress oppose.
</P>
<P>
   ``If at some point we run out of resources,'' Camdessus said,
``the international community will have to face its
responsibilities and decide whether countries that are helping
themselves should be abandoned by the international community.''
</P>
<P>
   The IMF now has in the bank only about $13 billion not already
committed to lending programs or to other IMF commitments, fund
officials say. That is one of the lowest levels in the IMF's
history. The $13 billion does not include about $10 billion that
the IMF has already earmarked for Russia but has not yet actually
disbursed.
</P>
<P>
   The $4.3 billion loan scheduled for late September would come
out of this $10 billion. That would leave $5.7 billion for future
lending. Since 1992, after Russia had emerged from the former
Soviet Union, it has received a total of $21 billion in IMF loans
and has made repayments on time, according to fund officials.

FLAWS IN U.S. ACCOUNT RAISE QUESTIONS ON STRIKE IN SUDAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By TIM WEINER and STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the days since the United States bombed what it
called a secret chemical weapons plant in Sudan, some of the key
statements made by administration officials to justify the attack
have proven to be inaccurate, misleading or open to question.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials continue to say they bombed a facility that
produced a key ingredient for a deadly nerve agent. But their
descriptions of the plant as a highly secretive, tightly secured
military-industrial site, their initial statement that the plant
produced no commercial products, and their statements that the
exiled Saudi millionaire, Osama bin Laden, directly financed the
plant, do not appear to be factual.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials' efforts to strengthen their case have
been complicated by the extreme secrecy they imposed in launching
the attack, which they now say prevents them from showing their
evidence to the world. That secrecy and the inconsistencies in
their public statements have given the Sudanese government, which
the United States calls a sponsor of international terrorism, a
chance to challenge the justification for the attack and call for
an international inquiry. The administration's refusal to endorse
an inquiry also has become an issue in the international debate
over the attack.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton personally chose the bombing site, a
pharmaceutical plant in an industrial area of northern Khartoum, as
the target for U.S. cruise missiles, declining to strike any other
among a larger set of targets presented to him by military
planners.
</P>
<P>
   But it is unclear whether the CIA ever told Clinton that it was
also a medicine factory with a United Nations contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``There may have been better places to go,'' a Pentagon official
said Friday. ``That doesn't mean it was the wrong place to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said Monday that he stayed awake ``up till 2:30 in the
morning trying to make absolutely sure that at that chemical plant
there was no night shift.'' He added: ``I didn't want some person
who was a nobody to me, but who may have a family to feed and a
life to live, and probably had no earthly idea what else was going
on there, to die needlessly.''
</P>
<P>
   The plant made both medicine and veterinary drugs, according to
U.S. and European engineers and consultants who helped build,
design and supply the plant. The plant they describe was not a
tightly guarded chemical-weapons facility patrolled by Sudanese
soldiers, as a senior intelligence official described it last week.
</P>
<P>
   Briefing reporters hours after the attack on the plant, the
senior intelligence official said: ``We have no evidence _ or have
seen no products, commercial products that are sold out of this
facility.'' That representation was also made by the CIA to the
nation's most senior military officers, Pentagon officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The point the senior intelligence official was trying to make in
his briefing was that ``this was not a normal pharmaceutical
facility,'' his spokesman said Friday. His focus was on the
presence at the plant of Empta, a precursor chemical used to make
VX, a deadly nerve gas, the spokesman said. Senior U.S. officials
said that the CIA secretly took a soil sample from a few yards
outside the plant that, upon analysis, contained Empta.
</P>
<P>
   The plant ``just didn't lend itself to making chemical
weapons,'' said Tom Carnaffin, a British mechanical engineer who
served as technical manager at the plant during its construction
from 1992 to 1996. Workers there mixed pre-formulated chemicals
into medicines, he said, and lacked the space to stockpile or
manufacture other chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   But another government official said ``you could spin several
scenarios'' as to why Empta was found at the plant, including
suppositions that the chemical was stored or transported there.
Other officials now say it is unclear that Empta was actually
produced at the plant, but insisted that the soil sample proved the
factory's complicity in making VX.
</P>
<P>
   Several chemical-weapons experts outside the government say the
single soil sample, if it was not carefully preserved and quickly
tested, could have misidentified the key ingredient. They said
Empta is chemically similar to several commercially available
pesticides and herbicides, including the well-known commercially
available weedkiller called Round-Up. Senior government officials
say they are sure the CIA's chemical analysis was correct, and the
most compelling evidence they saw for attacking the plant.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA did not make clear to senior military officials that the
plant produced a large share of the medicine used in Sudan, a
Pentagon official said.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon official said: ``Some of the intelligence people
didn't know they would find any of that there,'' referring to
shattered remnants of medical products found in the wreckage of the
plant after the attack.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman would not say Friday whether the intelligence agency
told Clinton that the plant made medicine, or whether the agency
deemed that fact important. Several government officials said any
aspect of the plant beyond the presence of Empta in it was
irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of Defense William Cohen, in briefing reporters
shortly after the attack, said that bin Laden, the exiled Saudi
multi-millionaire whom the U.S. blames for the bombings of U.S.
embassies in Africa, helped finance the plant.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do know that he had contributed to this particular
facility,'' Cohen said. The U.S. government has presented no
evidence to support that, and some U.S. officials now say bin
Laden's financial support for Hassan al Turabi, Sudan's leading
political figure, as well as for the Sudanese military and
intelligence services did not directly flow to the plant itself.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the White House, the Pentagon and the CIA insist
that they hit the right target, and cite the soil sample as proof.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not sense here any question about the legitimacy of this
target,'' one administration official said. ``We have confidence in
the soil sample. It categorically demonstrates the presence of a
compound good for just one thing _ making VX by the Iraqi method.
The plant was set up with the encouragement of Turabi who urged bin
Laden to finance it. End of story.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   An intelligence official said: ``In retrospect and with the
benefit of hindsight it was the right target.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision to attack the plant was made in extreme secrecy by
a very small circle of senior officials, including few beyond
Clinton, Cohen, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, national
security adviser Sandy Berger and Army Gen. Henry Shelton, chairman
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Gen. Anthony Zinni, commander of U.S.
forces in the region, drew up the plans.
</P>
<P>
   In less lofty circles of the government, there is some
controversy about the attack on the plant in Khartoum. ``This is
all anybody in these corridors is talking about,'' one official
said. ``Why this facility? Why did nobody bother to talk to the
technical people who know about the evidence they had? Why was
there only one soil sample? And one lab test?''
</P>
<P>
   Other government officials have suggested privately that the
United States would have done better to strike other
military-industrial sites in Khartoum that, they say, are more
closely linked to chemical-weapons production. But this is armchair
generalship to senior military officials.
</P>
<P>
   In the days after the strike, the Pentagon conducted a thorough
review of all the evidence and reasoning that went into choosing
the factory. A senior military officer said that ``had we to do it
over again,'' the plant would remain a target.
</P>
<P>
   ``My feeling is the evidence is there,'' the officer said.
</P>
<P>
   The small amount of intelligence information released by the
Clinton administration to justify the attack contrasts with the
detailed intelligence made public by other administrations to
justify military strikes.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1986, President Reagan went so far as to make public
the contents of decoded Libyan diplomatic cables in explaining why
he had ordered a U.S. bombing raid that month on Tripoli, the
Libyan capital. In a White House speech, Reagan said the United
States had ``irrefutable'' evidence linking Libya to the bombing of
a West Berlin discotheque that killed a U.S. serviceman.
</P>
<P>
   While he did not divulge the exact source of the information, he
said that the Libyan government had sent messages to its embassy in
East Berlin about a week before the bombing at the discotheque to
conduct a ``terrorist attack against Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   The day before the attack, he said, the Libyan embassy ``alerted
Tripoli that the attack would be carried out the following morning
_ the next day, they reported back to Tripoli on the great success
of their mission.''
</P>
<P>
   His move outraged intelligence officers, who said the disclosure
had damaged their ability to gather information on terrorist
groups, but it was seen by the Reagan administration as vital in
winning the support of U.S. allies and the public.

JAPANESE STOCKS DROP BY $241 BILLION IN A WEEK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: Inserts 2 grafs that begin ``A weakened Japan.'' Inserts 2
grafs that begin ``Obuchi has taken.'' No other changes.)  (lb) 
 By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF and SHERYL WuDUNN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ One statistic on Friday evening stands out as an
explanation of the importance of Japan, along with its misery:
</P>
<P>
   When trading ended Friday at the Tokyo Stock Exchange, Japanese
stocks this week alone had dropped in value by $241 billion _ a sum
that exceeds the size of the entire annual output of the Russian
economy at present exchange rates. In other words, in one glum
week's work, Japan managed the financial equivalent of erasing
Russia from the world map for a year.
</P>
<P>
   Japan is so monumental as to be central to the health of the
global economy, but for now it remains a mess. A month after Prime
Minister Keizo Obuchi took office, vowing ``to deal with each issue
in a dramatic, speedy way,'' Japan remains firmly in recession and
largely paralyzed politically and economically.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market fell 3.5 percent Friday to its lowest level
since 1986, while long-term bond yields tumbled to 1.07 percent.
They are the lowest long-term interest rates in recorded history,
having recently fallen below the previous record low rate of 1.125
percent offered by the Italian city-state of Genoa in 1619.
</P>
<P>
   The markets are tumbling because for all Obuchi's pledges, Japan
is in even greater political gridlock than usual. Obuchi's ruling
Liberal Democratic Party has never been described as energetic,
except by itself, but these days even its modest plans to revive
the banking system are being blocked by opposition parties in the
Diet, or Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   The upshot is that the six bills that represent the centerpiece
of Obuchi's plans to revive the economy remain stuck in numbing
Diet hearings. Officials acknowledge that it will be difficult to
win passage of the bills by the time Obuchi meets President Clinton
for a mini-summit meeting in New York planned for around Sept. 21,
and the delays and stalemate are further dispiriting the markets
here and around the world.
</P>
<P>
   In short, expectations of Obuchi were low, and he has met them.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the long term, the Japanese situation is in some ways even
worse than the Russian situation, particularly given the size of
the Japanese economy and the seeming inability to take really
serious action,'' said M.Y. Yoshino, a Harvard Business School
professor who is an expert on Japan and is now visiting Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   Yoshino noted that for all the vast scale of the bad bank debts
in Japan _ perhaps five times the size of the entire Russian market
before its collapse _ there is little move toward dramatic
restructuring to restore sustained economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   A banking analyst at ING Barings Securities Japan Ltd. in Tokyo,
James Fiorillo, penned a bit of verse that captures the mood here.
It begins:
</P>
<P>
   ``'Twas the night before crisis
</P>
<P>
   And behind the Diet border
</P>
<P>
   Not a creature was stirring,
</P>
<P>
   To restore financial order.''
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi and his aides have been defending their conduct, but the
defenses have only added to the impression that the government does
not have the same sense of urgency as the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, for example, Obuchi was scolded in Parliament by a
prominent economist, Yoshio Suzuki, who accused the government of
adopting economic measures that were _ he switched to English _
``too little, too late.''
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi, who by all accounts is an exceptionally friendly and
genial man, grinned and replied that if anything, his efforts had
been _ here he switched to English _ ``too much, too fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told reporters after stocks
tumbled Friday: ``This isn't something to panic about. With the
passage of time, the market will stabilize again.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Miyazawa and Obuchi are trying to reassure the public,
but to some it comes across as complacency. Officials have been
reassuring ever since Japan's ``bubble economy'' burst in about
1991, and yet declining asset values have steadily erased more than
$5 trillion in wealth, equivalent to wiping out half the entire
value of all the stocks on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, this is the worst scenario,'' warned Masaru Takagi,
an economist at Meiji University, referring to the plodding
approach by the government and the stalemate in Parliament. Takagi
estimated that there is a 50 percent chance the Obuchi government
will collapse and be forced to call fresh elections, delaying any
further moves to revive Japan's economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no time to waste, so we must avoid a general election
this year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition parties, however, seeing blood in the water, are
circling eagerly and insisting that this is just the time for
general elections to break the deadlock, instead of waiting for two
more years until elections are due.
</P>
<P>
   ``General elections should come fast,'' said Suzuki, the
economist, who is now a member of Parliament for the opposition
Liberal Party. ``We're now in a standstill, and in that case no
bills may pass the Diet, and economic and financial crises may
occur.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, Obuchi's government is weak in part because of
constant complaining by critics at home and abroad, especially in
the U.S. Treasury Department, who want Japan to act far more
decisively to address its economic problems. But the criticism has
so weakened the government that it is less able than ever to push
through economic measures.
</P>
<P>
   A weakened Japan is a global problem because it exacerbates the
Asian crisis, and because the plummeting yen has been squeezing
China, South Korea and other countries. President Jiang Zemin of
China this week appealed again to Japan to do more to boost its
economy, and many experts fear that China may eventually be
pressured to devalue its currency, setting off a new round of
devaluations and financial crises around Asia.
</P>
<P>
   All that has added to the demands on Obuchi to be more
aggressive in tackling Japan's problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some substantial initiative needs to be taken by the
government,'' said Takeshi Sasaki, a political scientist at Tokyo
University. ``It is the responsibility of the government, or it can
be the end of the Obuchi government.''
</P>
<P>
   The opposition usually does not matter much in the Japanese
Parliament, but the main opposition leader, Naoto Kan, has crafted
a broad and relatively unified front that has blocked the
government's proposals and offered its own. Some economists think
Kan's financial plan is better than the government's, because it
insists on more bank disclosure, but there are also criticisms that
Kan is playing politics with Japan's economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``The opposition sees a chance to force the government down,
even if it happens to bring the economy down,'' said Richard
Jerram, an economist at ING Barings Securities Japan Ltd.
``Politicians are oblivious to things in the real world, it's
pretty clear.''
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi clearly wants to have the bills passed by the time he
meets Clinton, and one Cabinet official said the prime minister
would meet opposition leaders soon to work out a compromise. The
fall in global markets may increase the pressure on both sides to
work out a deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we were not a parliamentary democracy, of course we would
be able to make progress on many issues, but that's not the case,''
said Akitaka Saiki, a spokesman for Obuchi. ``If you call this
paralysis, that could be one reason.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he thought the West was too impatient for results,
considering that Obuchi has been in office for only one month,
Saiki scarcely paused.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not just the West,'' he said glumly. ``Everyone is a bit
impatient.''
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi has taken some steps that are significant, even if they
are less than his critics seek. He froze a fiscal austerity law,
laying the groundwork for continued fiscal stimulus packages, and
he prepared new budget guidelines and convened an economic advisory
panel with coming up with creative ways to revive the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Yet one indication of Obuchi's weakness and the perception that
he will not survive long is that he has had trouble recruiting
people. Sadako Ogata, the highly regarded U.N. high commissioner
for refugees, turned down an invitation to be foreign minister, one
official said, and several prominent business leaders reportedly
declined to serve on the advisory panel.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens in Parliament, the situation is not entirely
bleak. Above all, before Obuchi took office the Parliament passed a
huge fiscal stimulus package, which will trickle through the
economy this fall and generate some growth.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Obuchi does not dramatically liberalize the economy _
and almost no one thinks that is a realistic possibility _ the
stimulus itself and some associated tax cuts will lend a healthy
boost.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, much of Japan's economic problem arises from a nearly
universal gloom that makes everyone reluctant to buy or invest.
That psychology is impossible to predict, but some optimists
believe that the fiscal stimulus could restore growth, change the
public mood, and restore the economy to life. That, if it happened,
should revive the property and stock markets, and many bad loans
would become good again.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pessimism,'' said Richard Koo, chief economist at Nomura
Research Institute in Tokyo, ``has been going too far.''

INTERNET SHOPPING COMPANY'S PRESIDENT, CO-FOUNDER RESIGNS; STAFF
CUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY GREGORY J. WILCOX  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ iMall Inc., an Internet shopping service, said it
has closed the unprofitable seminar and training division that
accounted for 90 percent of the company's revenue.
</P>
<P>
   iMall co-founder Mark Comer, who ran the division based in Salt
Lake City, also resigned Friday as the company's president. He
remains on the iMall board and still holds about 1.2 million shares
in the company.
</P>
<P>
   About 40 people worked at the unit, which conducted seminars in
various cities on how merchants could use the Internet to enhance
their business, and about 10 of them remain with the company, said
Anthony Mazzarella, chief financial officer and executive vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   The move is not entirely a surprise. iMall said in its
second-quarter financial statement that the non-reoccurring nature
of the revenue generated by the training unit and the low-margin,
intensely competitive environment it operated in made it
incompatible with the company's electronic commerce focus.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of iMall fell 68.75 cents to $6 3/8 on Friday on 70,700
shares traded, or approximately twice as much as its 30-month daily
average volume.
</P>
<P>
   The training division was not profitable and accounted for about
$3 million of the $3.4 million in revenue during the June second
quarter. During that period, iMall lost $2.6 million, or 39 cents
per diluted share. In the 1997 second quarter the company had
revenue of $5.1 million and a net loss of $600,000 or 8 cents a
share.
</P>
<P>
   The decline in revenue on a year-over-year basis reflects the
company's scaling back of its seminar and training operations,
Mazzarella said.
</P>
<P>
   iMall expects to sell the division's assets for approximately
their net book value, which is under $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``While making this change probably doesn't lead to
profitability sooner it leads to much greater profitability and
more sustainable profitability,'' Mazzarella said.

SECURITIES FIRMS' OWN STOCK PRICES ARE HURTING 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)

<P>
   NEW YORK _ While banks worldwide have seen values tumble because
of the Russian flu, Wall Street's brokerage firms and investment
banks are suffering from their own version of a severe head cold.
</P>
<P>
   Shares in Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter are well
off peak prices, trading Friday for about one-third less than they
were in July, when they hit yearly highs. Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc., which closed at $45.6875 Friday, is fast approaching its
52-week low. Even Travelers Group, the diversified financial
services company that owns the investment bank Salomon Smith
Barney, is off 34 percent since it announced its merger with
Citicorp in April.
</P>
<P>
   Although the weakness in bank stocks is mainly being chalked up
to concerns about loans and investments in Russia and Asia,
brokerage firms are troubled by even more mundane concerns at home:
fear that equity underwriting and trading in fixed-income products
will not be as lucrative this year. Volatile prices and declining
liquidity in corporate and high-yield bonds in recent weeks are
making it harder for brokerage firms to turn a profit in those
products.
</P>
<P>
   And August 1998 has turned out to be one of the worst months in
years in terms of the demand for initial public offerings.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, analysts have revised earnings estimates on
brokerage stocks to reflect a growing pessimism regarding Wall
Street's profitability. Friday, for instance, Guy Moszkowski, a
Salomon Smith Barney brokerage analyst, lowered his third-quarter
estimate for Merrill Lynch to $1.05 a share from $1.29, citing
possible weaknesses in its fixed-income trading and equity
underwriting businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Two days earlier, Merrill Lynch lowered its estimates for Lehman
Brothers' 1998 fiscal year earnings to $6.10 a share from $6.35 as
a result of the firm's international market exposure and its
dependence on revenue from fixed-income products.
</P>
<P>
   And the week before, Goldman, Sachs removed Credit Suisse from
its ``recommended for purchase'' list, fearing the company's
exposure to Russian markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market is trashing these companies because of uncertainty
about the earnings stream in the next six to eight quarters,'' said
Dean Eberling, a brokerage industry analyst at Putnam, Lovell, de
Guardiola &AMP; Thornton. ``The risk around earnings is as high today
as it was in 1994.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the dimmest spots for brokerage firms is the lucrative
initial-offering market, which has been almost comatose this month.
In August, 19 companies valued at $1.3 billion have gone public,
according to Securities Data Co. That is the lowest number since
January of 1995. Compare that with August 1997, when 49 companies
valued at $2.9 billion went public. While August is typically a
slow month for new issues, analysts fear the volatile markets could
cool any interest in new issues this fall. ``The market has been
severely hampered by the uncertainty in all markets,'' said
Securities Data analyst Richard Peterson.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, it is questionable whether Goldman, Sachs _ which
filed a preliminary prospectus last week for its own much-watched
initial public offering _ will be able to command the lofty
premiums partners hoped to get when they voted to go public in
June. That is even more true now, people in the industry say,
because Goldman relies on its trading operations and
initial-offering underwriting for revenue.
</P>
<P>
   While there is nothing to suggest that Goldman will pull the
offering, a discounted price could give some partners reason to
pause.
</P>
<P>
   The one bright spot for all brokerage firms and investment banks
in the third quarter, surprisingly, should be mergers and
acquisitions. It is unlikely that business will halt completely
even in a tumultuous market, and the string of deals closing this
quarter will provide firms with a stream of revenue that should
offset shortfalls in other businesses, Moszkowski said.
</P>
<P>
   Also, low prices could spur some companies to act. ``For
strategic buyers it depends on whether their stock price has
declined,'' he said. If not, but the target has suffered a decline,
``it could be more tempting.''

   NEW YORK _ Fashion emergency: ``When you're at your desk and
want to wear your glasses on your head, you don't want them to keep
falling in your face, sliding down your nose,'' said Frederic
Fekkai, the entrepreneurial hairdresser. ``It's annoying _ not to
mention unflattering.'' His remedy is a line of women's sunglasses
designed to be worn atop the head.
</P>
<P>
   With specially curved arms and extra-flexible hinges described
as ergonomic temple tips, the shades, created by Fekkai with the
eyewear designer Alain Mikli, can double as hair bands, without the
usual trouble of stretching or damaging the frame or giving the
wearer an unfashionable headache.
</P>
<P>
   They come in colors designed to enhance all hues of hair: green
tortoise for light chestnut or dark red hair, apricot for
strawberry blondes or brunettes, blue for ash blondes. The glasses,
which are $135 to $165 at Fekkai's salon, Saks Fifth Avenue and
Neiman Marcus, have 100 percent ultraviolet-protective lenses to
protect the eyes from the sun _ though not necessarily from hair
gel.

   Booster Shots
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the culture of now, no one has time to wait for
vitamin capsules to break down and start working. So tiny vials of
liquid herbal and vitamin supplements are popping up around town,
being consumed by health-minded people looking for a quick jolt.
Made by Nature's Solutions, the vials _ bright orange beakers sold
in six-packs at health-food stores _ are advertised to provide
quicker absorption into the bloodstream and higher potency in
smaller doses. Plus they're cute.
</P>
<P>
   But can they actually provide instant results? ``Liquid vitamins
and herbals enter your system faster, but they still require time
to be absorbed from the stomach,'' said Gayle Reichler, a
nutritionist and the founder of Active Wellness Inc. ``So any
immediate effects you feel are probably a case of mind over
matter.''
</P>
<P>
   That's good enough for Gabrielle Sherb, 25, a Manhattan retail
consultant and marathon runner who downs Nature's Solutions'
Ginseng and Royal Jelly cocktail as if it were espresso. ``I wake
up, drink a shot and start my day,'' she said. ``And in 20 minutes
I feel a difference. It's like, wow, I really do have more
energy.''

   Architectural Philosophy
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Alberta Ferretti is a designer known for her subtly
layered look: tulle over cotton, a sliver of hand-beaded gauze
peeking out from beneath the hem of a wool dress. So when Ms.
Ferretti, who is based in Milan, Italy, asked the Manhattan
architect David Ling to design her first store in New York,
Philosophy di Alberta Ferretti, which opens in SoHo on Tuesday, he
came up with the architectural equivalent of her clothes.
</P>
<P>
   The pristinely white 1,000-square-foot shop is a light-filled
study of layers, from the sheer cotton scrim that veils the
staircase to the running water glimpsed beneath a translucent glass
floor. ``The wood is analogous to the wools and cashmere, the glass
to the transparent fabric, the mirror to the crystal beading,'' Ms.
Ferretti said.
</P>
<P>
   All the philosophy behind the design may not be instantly
apparent to the clothes horses visiting the store, at 452 West
Broadway, near Prince Street. But if they miss at first the
hand-waxed finish on the walls or the hand-rubbed patina on the
furniture, that's OK with Ling. ``Unlike the typical SoHo loft,
which is seen and understood at one glance,'' he said, ``I want
people to peer around corners and unpeel the layers.''

   Shrink Your Thighs
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Jungian analysis interprets the psyche through
archetypes. Now it's being applied to treat body types. Dr. DeAnsin
Parker, a psychotherapist and the founder of the Goodson Parker
Wellness Center, a gym and health club at 30 East 76th St. visited
by celebrities like Elle Macpherson, Kyra Sedgwick and Yasmeen
Ghauri, is taking the craze for mind-and-body merging a step
further than power yoga.
</P>
<P>
   Using Myers-Briggs test questions (``Are you usually a good
mixer or quiet and reserved?''), Dr. Parker offers hourlong
sessions, for $200, to classify clients into one of four
personality types _ and matches them to a workout that she says is
``spiritually appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   For an introverted-integrated personality type, who likes to
function on multiple levels, she suggests sports with complex
circular movements, like golf. For a concrete personality type, who
needs to see results and statistics, a treadmill is what the doctor
orders.
</P>
<P>
   But some Jungian experts believe it takes more than an hour to
classify a personality type. ``Jung wouldn't like it,'' said Paul
Wink, a psychology professor at Wellesley College. ``He was always
skeptical of Americans' need for a quick fix.''
</P>
<P>
   Dressing Up the Robe
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Grooming to look good apparently isn't enough. These
days, New Yorkers need to look good while they groom, and they are
making fashion statements even while wrapped in frumpy protective
robes in salons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got women wearing their own Hermes belts outside the
robe, sticking in shoulder pads, flashing peekaboo lingerie,'' said
Steven Berg, a stylist at John Barrett Salon in Bergdorf Goodman.
</P>
<P>
   At Kim Lepine on Madison Avenue, brooches on robes are a must.
``Robes can be pretty uninspiring,'' Ms. Lepine, the owner, said.
``Dressing them up makes you feel better.''
</P>
<P>
   Berg offers pointers: Avoid jeans, because they create a lumpish
effect. Pull the belt straight and flat for a neater finish. And
men, for heaven's sake, keep your pants on. ``A lot of guys think
they're at the doctor and take everything off,'' he said. ``A short
robe, hairy legs and dark socks is not a good look.''

DIANA HAD `IT`: THE MYSTERIOUS POWER TO ENCHANT

 WHY?-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

<P>
   UNDATED - It is the fate of princesses and commoners to die.
Most pass without fanfare, but for a few the trumpets sound. What
is there about a Diana, a James Dean, a John F. Kennedy or a
Rudolph Valentino that engages the imagination and hearts of
millions?
</P>
<P>
   The vast outpouring of grief and affection that accompanied the
Princess of Wales to her grave caught many by surprise. They asked,
and still ask, ``Why did she touch so many?''
</P>
<P>
   They could do worse than turn to Elinor Glyn for the answer.
</P>
<P>
   At the height of the Jazz Age, a Hollywood fan magazine asked
the English novelist to define celebrity appeal. Glyn, notorious
for her florid prose and her penchant for receiving callers in the
nude, summed it up in one word.
</P>
<P>
   ``It.''
</P>
<P>
   `` `It' is that quality possessed by some which draws all others
with its magnetic force,'' she wrote. ``With `It' you can draw all
men, if you are a woman, and all women, if you are a man. `It' can
be a quality of the mind, as well as a physical attraction.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Madame Glyn, as she insisted on being called, gave examples.
Clara Bow had ``It.'' So did Greta Garbo and Rudolph Valentino.
Charles Lindbergh and Albert Einstein were loaded with the
commodity. Even Calvin Coolidge was no stranger to the phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   OK, maybe she was wrong about Coolidge, but even so, Glyn was on
to something.
</P>
<P>
   Every so often the human gene pool tosses up an individual with
the power to enchant the rest of the species. Is it black magic or
sexual chemistry? Manipulation or circumstance? Thousands of words
have been written on the subject but none explain it any more
clearly than Madame Glyn's single syllable.
</P>
<P>
   A few have that indefinable something. The rest of us don't.
</P>
<P>
   Diana, in whatever manifestation she chose to parade herself _
Sloan Street Ranger, Princess of Wales, devoted mother, adulterous
wife or tireless worker for good causes _ was simply the latest in
a long line of those possessed of ``It.'' What sets her apart is
the textbook illustration she provides on how an individual can
sidestep the normal banality of life and pass into the iconography
and, ultimately, the mythology of the race.
</P>
<P>
   Like her predecessors in that regard, Diana didn't ask for
``It;'' she was born with charisma and an instinct for manipulating
her environment. Like most of those who receive such gifts, she was
fated to live on a grand scale, with her Feragamo pumps mired in
the clay even as her tiara pierced the clouds.
</P>
<P>
   Sanctity and soap opera are a vulgar mix but it is the life's
blood of this chosen few.
</P>
<P>
   It is the vanity of our age to believe that media celebrities
are a contemporary invention. The chain of succession probably
stretches back to a cave somewhere in Africa's Rift Valley, when an
apelike individual found himself (or perhaps herself) lifted above
the shoulders of the hairy throng.
</P>
<P>
   The invention of the printing press and the media circus it
ultimately unleashed didn't increase the ranks of those with
``It,'' it simply stratosphered their publicity. Circulars and
broadsheets, then newspapers and tabloids spread the word, joined
in the 20th century by movies, TV and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to this adulation and exposure, the ``Its'' have defined
the planet's dreams even as they aroused its fantasies, shocked it
with their behavior and titillated it with their all-too-human
failings.
</P>
<P>
   The power can be insidious as well as inspirational. There is a
dark side to the force, as George Lucas warned in his ``Star Wars''
trilogy, the best-ever evocation of celebrity (every character in
the trio of films has ``It''). Genghis Khan possessed the quality,
so did Hitler, Idi Amin and Pol Pot. One of the hallmarks of the
breed is the ability to ensnare hearts and minds, whether for good
or evil.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the ``It'' qualities, charisma is the hardest to pin
down, yet the most necessary to the holder's appeal. What is it
about some people that asks _ no, demands _ that we look at them?
Spread out a dozen photographs of crowds containing Diana in their
midst and the eye almost immediately goes to her.
</P>
<P>
   It's not really about looks. No one can call Humphrey Bogart
cute or Bette Davis classically beautiful. Helen's face may have
launched a naval armada, but Cleopatra was by all accounts a rather
dumpy woman. Napoleon, whose reputation as a stud owed nothing to
invention, didn't let being short and a bit bow-legged slow him
down.
</P>
<P>
   What made Diana seem beautiful to us? Dollmakers are learning
how difficult it is to capture her appearance. Few of the replicas
look like the princess; in frustration, the designers concentrate
on the gowns. That inner glow, that intensity of spirit, is not
susceptible to molds of porcelain or vinyl.
</P>
<P>
   The advantage of hindsight is that we can see that it was always
there, even in Diana's first public engagements. Behind the
gawkiness and inexperience lurks the glint of humor, the suggestion
of genuine humanity and depth. Like John Wayne, who showed up in
his first movie, ``The Big Trail,'' with the legend largely intact,
only younger and better looking, Diana made her entrance with her
flags in place, needing only time and maturity to unfurl them and
set them flying.
</P>
<P>
   Like everyone truly possessed of ``It,'' Diana could touch those
around her in subtle but powerful ways. Recently, ``TV Guide''
published a picture of the princess walking with Sir Richard
Attenborough. As always, the eye focuses on her, but her attention
is squarely on Sir Richard. Intensely, physically so. Something
passes from nerve end to nerve end in these instances, the feeling
that in spite of their fame and beauty, these people really care
about us. (begin ital)``We'' (end ital) are important to them _ and
therefore of consequence, regardless of how lowly our status is in
comparison to theirs.
</P>
<P>
   It can't be denied that part of the appeal is sexual. There is a
physical chemistry involved, one that isn't reproducible in the
laboratory but is no less real for all that. People with ``It''
have something extra, and a good chunk of it is carnal. Marilyn
Monroe's impact was hormonal, as was the young Marlon Brando's. In
Napoleon's day, women swooned over his painted portrait, even as
they did a hundred years later over the filmed image of Valentino.
</P>
<P>
   One suspects that a portion of the sympathy poured out on Diana
was a subconscious response to the dichotomy of a vibrant,
life-affirming woman paired up with a stick like Charles. It was
hard enough to picture them having a decent conversation, much less
in bed.
</P>
<P>
   One would like to take the high-minded approach and ignore the
more human failings of Diana and the other ``Its,'' but it is their
behavior as much as anything that elevates them into the realm of
legend. Arthur may have created the Round Table, but it is his
wife's adultery that is the stuff of Broadway musicals. Helen was a
married woman. So, for that matter, was Cleopatra _ to her brother.
And when it comes to sex, the less said about Grover Cleveland and
JFK the better, while even today's tabloids might shy at printing
the details of Clara Bow's affair with Gary Cooper.
</P>
<P>
   ``Feet of clay'' is more than a cliche. It is virtually a
requirement for iconhood. The average person leads a mundane
existence; a little soap opera is to be relished, and the juicier
the details, the tastier the feast.
</P>
<P>
   If not soap opera, then tragedy. The kidnapping and death of
Lindbergh's baby has as much to do with his legend as his solo
flight across the Atlantic. The wealthy passengers on the
``Titanic'' are as real to the modern world as they were to the
public of 1912.
</P>
<P>
   And, always, a touch of mystery plays well. Was it Princess
Grace or her daughter at the wheel? Did Marilyn commit suicide or
was she murdered?
</P>
<P>
   Of the world's billions, few are paged for their 15 minutes of
fame, and fewer still emerge as genuine celebrities. Of that
number, only a handful are raised by virtue of personal charisma or
fate to the level of icon and myth.
</P>
<P>
   It can be argued that we worship these people for the wrong
reasons, and, mostly, we do. But every now and then we get it
right. From the ranks of these emotional flytraps, we settle on a
few that, in spite of their shortcomings, aspire to and achieve, as
much as is ever humanly possible, something worthy of our
admiration.
</P>
<P>
   Being what we are, we won't forget Diana's bulimia, her
relationships with the royals or her manipulation of public
opinion. But what will kindle our imagination and hope, and the
imagination and hope of future generations, is that she genuinely
tried to make the world she inherited a better place. Even as JFK
tried, and Joan of Arc and Mother Teresa and Gandhi and all the
rest tried.
</P>
<P>
   Her achievements cannot be equated with theirs, but there is no
result without intent. It was Diana's gift of charisma and fateful
life that made her first a celebrity, then an icon for an age. But
it was her heart, which she wore on her sleeve and shared with all,
that may, in years to come, transform her into an enduring myth.
</P>
<P>
   What is mythology's role if not to instruct the race to a nobler
end? And what is Diana's legacy if not the determination that no
matter what the gods send, one must endure and soldier on?
</P>
<P>
   Love her, despise her or simply remain indifferent: She had what
it takes. She had ``It.''
</P>
<P>
   And ``It'' will not be denied. &QL;

MRV SHARES DROP SHARPLY

 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY BEN SULLIVAN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Shares in telecommunications equipment maker MRV
Communications lost more than half their value Friday, a day after
the company said it will experience lower-than-expected
third-quarter sales.
</P>
<P>
   Like thousands of publicly traded firms, MRV saw its share price
dip in Thursday's big market sell-off, losing $2.50, or 14.8
percent of its value. But while other companies were breathing
easier Friday, MRV shares were melting down.
</P>
<P>
   In the first 10 minutes of trading the issue dropped 42.6
percent, going from $14 3/8 a share to $8 1/4. By the end of the
day, the share price had lost $7 9/16, or 52.6 percent of its
value. More than 11.5 million shares in the company traded hands,
roughly 22 times its three-month average daily volume.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not exactly what I expected,'' said MRV President and
Chief Executive Officer Noam Lotan, who said he spent nearly all of
Friday speaking with investors, reassuring them about the company's
fundamentals.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts, too, were caught off guard by the plunge. ``It seems a
bit excessive unless there's another story we don't know about,''
said Craig Bernstein at First Montauk Securities. ``Just yesterday
it looked like $14 or $15 would be the bottom.''
</P>
<P>
   Late Thursday, Lotan said weak sales of the company's existing
networking products, particularly in Europe, will mean
third-quarter revenues 10 to 15 percent below the $65.7 million
generated in the second quarter. Also, delays in the introduction
of next-generation products meant to launch this quarter will pinch
earnings. The products are now slated to arrive in the fourth
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Compounding its sales woes, MRV's gross margins will shrink,
Lotan said, as costs for research, development and general expenses
will rise 8 percent to 10 percent above the $17.4 million reported
in the second quarter. Lotan said that would hurt earnings, but
would not speculate by how much. Before Thursday's announcement,
MRV was expected to earn 31 to 32 cents a share by analysts
surveyed by IBES International Inc. and First Call Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Lotan said, the company will not lose money and should
experience a 30 percent or more increase in third-quarter sales,
year-to-year. Last year the company had earnings of $5.92 million,
or 23 cents a share, on sales of $42 million. &QL;

   KINSHASA, Congo _ Two days after heavy shelling and gunfire
erupted on the capital's fringes, government forces continued to
assert control over the area Friday, and fighting with rebels was
confined to a few pockets.
</P>
<P>
   On city streets that had been deserted in the last two days,
life was closer to normal, and residents could be seen selling
goods and traveling around despite numerous security checkpoints.
Government soldiers moved around in trucks, flashing victory signs,
chanting songs and firing automatic weapons into the air.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials warned that it was too early to claim final
victory in Kinshasa. But it appeared that the threat of a rebel
takeover of Kinshasa _ which had seemed all but inevitable before
Angola and Zimbabwe began supplying arms and men to President
Laurent Kabila _ is now greatly diminished.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if the rebels really intended it,'' said a Western
diplomat here, ``they would have come in a big way last night or
the night before. All of this now seems to have been a half-hearted
attempt by the rebels to stir the pot to see what would happen, and
the government is getting the situation under control.''
</P>
<P>
   The government continued to prevent foreign journalists from
reporting freely in the city. But on a trip to the airport,
organized by the government, the effects of the war were visible.
Thousands of residents, who were fleeing outlying areas where the
fighting had been concentrated, could be seen marching toward the
city's center in single file, many pushing handcarts and carrying
other belongings.
</P>
<P>
   A great number of people could also be seen leaving a
residential neighborhood near a forest where rebels were supposed
to be hiding. Government soldiers said they were preparing to bomb
the forest.
</P>
<P>
   City residents coming to downtown hotels also reported seeing
more instances of public killings that began on Thursday. Bodies of
suspected rebels could be seen throughout the city, some hanging
from trees, they said. One taxi driver said he saw soldiers push
four men into a river near a sports stadium and shoot them before a
cheering crowd.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels, who are led by ethnic Tutsi in eastern Congo and are
believed to be backed by Rwanda and Uganda, still control key
cities in eastern Congo. But they have been weakened in the area
southwest of Kinshasa because of the support the government has
received from Angola and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
   The government and its allies say they are expected to
eventually eliminate the rebel presence in the southwest, and
Western diplomats here agree that is likely. Rebels still control
critical points, however, including a giant hydroelectric dam that
supplies electricity to the Kinshasa region.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials took reporters to Kinshasa's main airport,
near where the most intense fighting had taken place on Wednesday.
No gunfire was heard in the area.
</P>
<P>
   In the airport's VIP lounge, furnished with plush beige sofas
and glass coffee tables, government officials showed reporters nine
young men, whom they said had been taken prisoner in battles
southwest of Kinshasa. Six of the men identified themselves as
Rwandan, and spoke the languages of Rwanda. The others said they
were Congolese.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kagame sends children to die here, and here is the evidence,''
said Mawapanga Mwana Nanga, the Congo's minister of agriculture,
referring to Paul Kagame, the Rwandan vice president and defense
minister.
</P>
<P>
   Rwanda and Uganda have denied supporting the rebellion against
Kabila, although most Western officials believe that they have.
Both countries played key roles in choosing Kabila to lead a
successful rebellion less than two years ago against Mobutu Sese
Seko, the country's dictator for 32 years.
</P>
<P>
   But relations between Kabila and his Rwandan sponsors soured
after he distanced himself from them. Kabila's close ties with the
Rwandans and the ethnic Tutsi had made him unpopular among the
Congolese.

   UNDATED - It is the fate of princesses and commoners to die.
Most pass without fanfare, but for a few the trumpets sound. What
is there about a Diana, a James Dean, a John F. Kennedy or a
Rudolph Valentino that engages the imagination and hearts of
millions?
</P>
<P>
   The vast outpouring of grief and affection that accompanied the
Princess of Wales to her grave caught many by surprise. They asked,
and still ask, ``Why did she touch so many?''
</P>
<P>
   They could do worse than turn to Elinor Glyn for the answer.
</P>
<P>
   At the height of the Jazz Age, a Hollywood fan magazine asked
the English novelist to define celebrity appeal. Glyn, notorious
for her florid prose and her penchant for receiving callers in the
nude, summed it up in one word.
</P>
<P>
   ``It.''
</P>
<P>
   `` `It' is that quality possessed by some which draws all others
with its magnetic force,'' she wrote. ``With `It' you can draw all
men, if you are a woman, and all women, if you are a man. `It' can
be a quality of the mind, as well as a physical attraction.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Madame Glyn, as she insisted on being called, gave examples.
Clara Bow had ``It.'' So did Greta Garbo and Rudolph Valentino.
Charles Lindbergh and Albert Einstein were loaded with the
commodity. Even Calvin Coolidge was no stranger to the phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   OK, maybe she was wrong about Coolidge, but even so, Glyn was on
to something.
</P>
<P>
   Every so often the human gene pool tosses up an individual with
the power to enchant the rest of the species. Is it black magic or
sexual chemistry? Manipulation or circumstance? Thousands of words
have been written on the subject but none explain it any more
clearly than Madame Glyn's single syllable.
</P>
<P>
   A few have that indefinable something. The rest of us don't.
</P>
<P>
   Diana, in whatever manifestation she chose to parade herself _
Sloan Street Ranger, Princess of Wales, devoted mother, adulterous
wife or tireless worker for good causes _ was simply the latest in
a long line of those possessed of ``It.'' What sets her apart is
the textbook illustration she provides on how an individual can
sidestep the normal banality of life and pass into the iconography
and, ultimately, the mythology of the race.
</P>
<P>
   Like her predecessors in that regard, Diana didn't ask for
``It;'' she was born with charisma and an instinct for manipulating
her environment. Like most of those who receive such gifts, she was
fated to live on a grand scale, with her Feragamo pumps mired in
the clay even as her tiara pierced the clouds.
</P>
<P>
   Sanctity and soap opera are a vulgar mix but it is the life's
blood of this chosen few.
</P>
<P>
   It is the vanity of our age to believe that media celebrities
are a contemporary invention. The chain of succession probably
stretches back to a cave somewhere in Africa's Rift Valley, when an
apelike individual found himself (or perhaps herself) lifted above
the shoulders of the hairy throng.
</P>
<P>
   The invention of the prnting press and the media circus it
ultimately unleashed didn't increase the ranks of those with
``It,'' it simply stratosphered their publicity. Circulars and
broadsheets, then newspapers and tabloids spread the word, joined
in the 20th century by movies, TV and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to this adulation and exposure, the ``Its'' have defined
the planet's dreams even as they aroused its fantasies, shocked it
with their behavior and titillated it with their all-too-human
failings.
</P>
<P>
   The power can be insidious as well as inspirational. There is a
dark side to the force, as George Lucas warned in his ``Star Wars''
trilogy, the best-ever evocation of celebrity (every character in
the trio of films has ``It''). Genghis Khan possessed the quality,
so did Hitler, Idi Amin and Pol Pot. One of the hallmarks of the
breed is the ability to ensnare hearts and minds, whether for good
or evil.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the ``It'' qualities, charisma is the hardest to pin
down, yet the most necessary to the holder's appeal. What is it
about some people that asks _ no, demands _ that we look at them?
Spread out a dozen photographs of crowds containing Diana in their
midst and the eye almost immediately goes to her.
</P>
<P>
   It's not really about looks. No one can call Humphrey Bogart
cute or Bette Davis classically beautiful. Helen's face may have
launched a naval armada, but Cleopatra was by all accounts a rather
dumpy woman. Napoleon, whose reputation as a stud owed nothing to
invention, didn't let being short and a bit bow-legged slow him
down.
</P>
<P>
   What made Diana seem beautiful to us? Dollmakers are learning
how difficult it is to capture her appearance. Few of the replicas
look like the princess; in frustration, the designers concentrate
on the gowns. That inner glow, that intensity of spirit, is not
susceptible to molds of porcelain or vinyl.
</P>
<P>
   The advantage of hindsight is that we can see that it was always
there, even in Diana's first public engagements. Behind the
gawkiness and inexperience lurks the glint of humor, the suggestion
of genuine humanity and depth. Like John Wayne, who showed up in
his first movie, ``The Big Trail,'' with the legend largely intact,
only younger and better looking, Diana made her entrance with her
flags in place, needing only time and maturity to unfurl them and
set them flying.
</P>
<P>
   Like everyone truly possessed of ``It,'' Diana could touch those
around her in subtle but powerful ways. Recently, ``TV Guide''
published a picture of the princess walking with Sir Richard
Attenborough. As always, the eye focuses on her, but her attention
is squarely on Sir Richard. Intensely, physically so. Something
passes from nerve end to nerve end in these instances, the feeling
that in spite of their fame and beauty, these people really care
about us. (begin ital)``We'' (end ital) are important to them _ and
therefore of consequence, regardless of how lowly our status is in
comparison to theirs.
</P>
<P>
   It can't be denied that part of the appeal is sexual. There is a
physical chemistry involved, one that isn't reproducible in the
laboratory but is no less real for all that. People with ``It''
have something extra, and a good chunk of it is carnal. Marilyn
Monroe's impact was hormonal, as was the young Marlon Brando's. In
Napoleon's day, women swooned over his painted portrait, even as
they did a hundred years later over the filmed image of Valentino.
</P>
<P>
   One suspects that a portion of the sympathy poured out on Diana
was a subconscious response to the dichotomy of a vibrant,
life-affirming woman paired up with a stick like Charles. It was
hard enough to picture them having a decent conversation, much less
in bed.
</P>
<P>
   One would like to take the high-minded approach and ignore the
more human failings of Diana and the other ``Its,'' but it is their
behavior as much as anything that elevates them into the realm of
legend. Arthur may have created the Round Table, but it is his
wife's adultery that is the stuff of Broadway musicals. Helen was a
married woman. So, for that matter, was Cleopatra _ to her brother.
And when it comes to sex, the less said about Grover Cleveland and
JFK the better, while even today's tabloids might shy at printing
the details of Clara Bow's affair with Gary Cooper.
</P>
<P>
   ``Feet of clay'' is more than a cliche. It is virtually a
requirement for iconhood. The average person leads a mundane
existence; a little soap opera is to be relished, and the juicier
the details, the tastier the feast.
</P>
<P>
   If not soap opera, then tragedy. The kidnapping and death of
Lindbergh's baby has as much to do with his legend as his solo
flight across the Atlantic. The wealthy passengers on the
``Titanic'' are as real to the modern world as they were to the
public of 1912.
</P>
<P>
   And, always, a touch of mystery plays well. Was it Princess
Grace or her daughter at the wheel? Did Marilyn commit suicide or
was she murdered?
</P>
<P>
   Of the world's billions, few are paged for their 15 minutes of
fame, and fewer still emerge as genuine celebrities. Of that
number, only a handful are raised by virtue of personal charisma or
fate to the level of icon and myth.
</P>
<P>
   It can be argued that we worship these people for the wrong
reasons, and, mostly, we do. But every now and then we get it
right. From the ranks of these emotional flytraps, we settle on a
few that, in spite of their shortcomings, aspire to and achieve, as
much as is ever humanly possible, something worthy of our
admiration.
</P>
<P>
   Being what we are, we won't forget Diana's bulimia, her
relationships with the royals or her manipulation of public
opinion. But what will kindle our imagination and hope, and the
imagination and hope of future generations, is that she genuinely
tried to make the world she inherited a better place. Even as JFK
tried, and Joan of Arc and Mother Teresa and Gandhi and all the
rest tried.
</P>
<P>
   Her achievements cannot be equated with theirs, but there is no
result without intent. It was Diana's gift of charisma and fateful
life that made her first a celebrity, then an icon for an age. But
it was her heart, which she wore on her sleeve and shared with all,
that may, in years to come, transform her into an enduring myth.
</P>
<P>
   What is mythology's role if not to instruct the race to a nobler
end? And what is Diana's legacy if not the determination that no
matter what the gods send, one must endure and soldier on?
</P>
<P>
   Love her, despise her or simply remain indifferent: She had what
it takes. She had ``It.''
</P>
<P>
   And ``It'' will not be denied. &QL;

   LAS VEGAS, Nev. _ Lin Newborn and Daniel Shersty were
inseparable. It did not matter that Newborn was black and worked in
a local body-piercing shop or that Shersty was white and was in the
Air Force, working on F-16's and other fighter planes at the nearby
Nellis Air Force Base.
</P>
<P>
   They were best friends. They shared a love of music and pretty
girls with nose rings. And even though Newborn and Shersty were
skinheads, they also shared a passionate hatred of racism _ and
that may be why they are dead.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the morning of the Fourth of July, before the fireworks
and the parades, someone shot them and left their bodies, separated
by 150 yards of sand and sorrow, in the desert on the outskirts of
town.
</P>
<P>
   Newborn was 24. Shersty was 20. So far there have been no
arrests in the case. But the police and the families and friends of
the young men suspect that they were killed by neo-Nazi skinheads.
</P>
<P>
   ``That seems to be the most likely,'' said Sgt. Ken Hefner of
the Las Vegas Police Department. ``I used to think all skinheads
were racist. I've come to find out during this investigation that I
was wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, for nearly two decades, anti-racist skinheads have been
confronting racist skinheads from coast to coast. Over the years,
the two sides have slashed each other's tires and bashed each other
over their shaved heads, but the violence usually stopped there.
</P>
<P>
   Now, shaken and angry, anti-racist skinheads and their allies
from around the country are scheduled to come to Las Vegas on
Saturday for a rally to honor their fallen comrades. The organizers
of the rally, which is expected to draw up to 1,000 people, say
they plan a peaceful protest. ``Losing two brothers is enough,''
said John Toddy, 19, one of the organizers here.
</P>
<P>
   The march and the incidents here have shed light on divisions
among the skinheads, a vaguely defined subculture whose definition
is the subject of fierce debate.
</P>
<P>
   For some adherents, being a skinhead is just fashion, featuring
shaved heads, Doc Martin boots and body piercing, as well as an
affinity for punk rock and Ska, a music mixture of Caribbean
influences, rhythm and blues and rock. For others, it is a fierce
pride in a working-class background. Still others add anger toward
minorities who, they believe, have cost working-class whites jobs
and other opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Skinhead is almost like a religion,'' said Noah Wildman of
Moon Ska Records in New York, which specializes in Ska music.
``Depending on who you ask, you will get very different
interpretations of the same concept.''
</P>
<P>
   The split between racist skinheads and anti-racist skinheads
began in England in the 1970s, around the time Newborn and Shersty
were born. From its beginnings in the 1960s, ``West Indian blacks
were very much a part of skinhead culture,'' said Mark Potok of the
Southern Poverty Law Center, which monitors hate groups around the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Class, not race, was the skinhead battle cry, Wildman said.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, huge sections of the working-class youth
counterculture and the media spotlight were co-opted by racist
groups like the British National Front, and skinheads were split
into two warring camps _ racist and anti-racist. When the movement
and music migrated to the United States in the late '70s, the split
crossed the ocean intact. And ever since, Potok said, ``there's
been a great deal of street fighting between the groups, up to and
including murder.''
</P>
<P>
   Potok estimates that there are fewer than 4,000 hard-core racist
skinheads across the country, and a somewhat smaller number of
non-racist skinheads. In Las Vegas, he said, the numbers are small
on both sides. There are probably more Elvis impersonators here
than skinheads.
</P>
<P>
   When Newborn and Shersty were found dead, the police had no idea
who killed them or why, Hefner said. Neither victim had been robbed
and neither had anything in his past that would provide a motive
for his killing, other than what Hefner called a ``constant
exchange of hatred'' between racist and anti-racist skinheads.
</P>
<P>
   Friends of Newborn and Shersty said that about a month before
the two men were killed, a third friend was hospitalized after
being hit over the head with a beer bottle by racist skinheads.
About that same time, state Sen. Michael Schneider, D-Las Vegas,
arrived on the scene of a drive-by shooting that he said was
committed by racist skinheads on a black family a few blocks from
his home.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   It appears that this city of neon is more of a rest stop than a
destination for racist skinheads moving on a trail of hate between
skinhead strongholds in Utah and Southern California. Still, Potok
said, ``there was a real racist skinhead scene in Las Vegas a few
years ago, and there remains a presence.''
</P>
<P>
   That presence, friends of Newborn and Shersty say, is why the
slain men helped start a Las Vegas chapter of a nationwide group,
Anti-Racist Action, which includes many skinheads but mostly
consists of non-skinheads like Toddy, a rally organizer.
</P>
<P>
   Friends of Newborn believe he was the main target of the attack
in the desert. He stood out. For a while he sang in a local band
called Life of Lies. He was a little older than many of his
friends, and had a 2-year-old son. He pierced noses, tongues and
navels at Tribal Body Piecing, and he was one of the few black
skinheads his friends had ever met.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came to our meetings and brought a lot of literature about
the true history of skinheads,'' Toddy said. ``He was a very key
player in the anti-racist movement here.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone, it seems, knew Newborn, and everyone called him by his
nickname, Spit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spit was a super-nice kid,'' said Harry Fagel, a police
officer who patrols the neighborhood where Newborn worked. ``He was
looked up to by the kids in the area. He espoused a viewpoint of
nonviolence. He wasn't a pacifist, but he didn't go looking for
trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Newborn was at work on July 3 when two young women came into the
shop and one had her navel pieced. Then she asked Newborn to a
party later that night. Newborn asked Shersty to go along and the
two friends slapped high fives about their good luck, said Marc
Isquith, the store owner.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the store closed at 9 p.m., Newborn and Shersty
got into Shersty's car and drove away. At first, it was believed
that the young women had set up a phony date with Newborn and
Shersty to lure them out to be ambushed. But Hefner would say only
that nothing had been ruled out.
</P>
<P>
   At 8 a.m. on the Fourth of July, a man driving a
four-wheel-drive vehicle in the desert found Shersty's body lying
next to his black Chevrolet Cavalier. He had been shot in the chest
with a shotgun.
</P>
<P>
   Shersty was from Florida. He joined the Air Force to earn money
for college, but he always wanted to be an actor. When his body was
found, he had a tattoo of the masks of comedy and tragedy on his
left shoulder. One mask was black and the other was white.
</P>
<P>
   Shersty's father, Walter, and his stepmother, Sharon, said they
had never discussed the evils of racial prejudice with him. ``But I
knew he wasn't prejudiced,'' Walter Shersty said. ``He always had
black friends and white friends and Puerto Rican friends. He was
like us. He treated people the way he wanted to be treated.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Shersty played trumpet in the school marching band, and
had one of the lead roles in his high school's production of
``Harvey.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He loved to get dressed up,'' the elder Shersty said. ``He was
a ham.''
</P>
<P>
   His son's remains are in an urn on the dining room table. He was
an only child.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I'm concerned, Danny is a hero,'' his stepmother
said. ``He not only died for his country, he died for his friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the rough terrain, Newborn's body, 150 yards away,
was not found until two days later.
</P>
<P>
   ``A while ago,'' Newborn's father, Lionel, said, ``Lin told me
he had some run-ins with Nazi-type skinheads. I feared for him, but
I never thought this would happen.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last 12 months, Lionel Newborn has buried his wife of 37
years, his oldest son, and now Lin.
</P>
<P>
   What made burying Lin a little easier, the father said, was the
hundreds of people who turned out for his funeral. At the service,
Newborn had a recording of his son's favorite group _ the Specials,
an interracial Ska band from England _ playing background music.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was overwhelmed,'' Newborn said. ``I didn't know that my son
was so popular. I used to tell Lin that he should do this or that
with his life. I'm glad he didn't listen to me and he lived his
life his way.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all want the best for our children, but I guess if our
children are doing what makes them happy, if they're helping
others, I guess you can't ask for much more,'' Newborn added. ``I'm
just very proud to be his dad.''

   MOMBASA, Kenya _ Salim Nassor Salim still remembers the day he
stopped talking to his brother-in-law, Mohammed Saddiq Odeh, the
man charged Friday with taking part in the bombing of the American
Embassy in Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
   About a year and a half ago, Salim said, he was driving a car
with Odeh in the back seat in the coastal town of Malindi. A
smoker, Salim had lit a cigarette.
</P>
<P>
   Without a word, Odeh, a conservative Muslim who objected to
smoking on religious grounds, reached forward and ripped the
cigarette from his brother-in-law's lips, scratching them badly and
drawing blood. He then threw it out the window with silent
violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not something to be done by someone with a good
mind,'' Salim said.
</P>
<P>
   While relatives said they had no clue that Odeh might have been
living a secret life as a terrorist, the incident may have been a
rare glimpse into his inner fury.
</P>
<P>
   Odeh has admitted to federal agents that he is part of a
dedicated and well-trained terrorist organization, based in
Afghanistan but operating worldwide, according to the indictment
against him.
</P>
<P>
   But for the last four years he managed to persuade his wife's
relatives in Kenya that he was a simple fisherman and carpenter.
</P>
<P>
   His relatives said that while he was man with strict religious
values, they nonetheless considered him kind and humble, as well as
a good husband. ``He didn't tell us about it if he was working for
any international societies,'' Salim said.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his stay in Kenya, Odeh's outward face was that of an
entrepreneur, struggling to make enough money with fishing and
carpentry to provide for his young wife, Nassim Nassor Salim, and
their infant son, Yasser.
</P>
<P>
   Until his relatives heard that he had been arrested in Pakistan
on Aug. 7 _ the same day twin car bombs exploded in Kenya and
Tanzania, killing more than 260 people _ none had gleaned any
reason to suspect differently. He had not even told his wife he was
leaving the country.
</P>
<P>
   He never spoke to his wife's family about his past, his
relatives said. He arrived in Mombasa in mid-August 1994, bearing a
Jordanian passport and saying he was a student. The passport said
he had been born in Saoudia, in Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   By October 1994, he had married Ms. Salim, a bright young woman
from Malindi who had gone to the best Koranic school in Nairobi. It
was a match arranged by mutual friends.
</P>
<P>
   Odeh practiced a strict form of Islam, his acquaintances said.
He objected strenuously to the family photographs on the walls, to
people smoking, to a woman showing her hair or ankles in public.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the rest of her family, Ms. Salim had also adopted
conservative ideas about religion while she was going to school at
Madras, a well-known Islamic college in Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after their marriage, Odeh bought a fiberglass boat from
Somalia with a powerful motor, his relatives said. He started a
fishing business and took an apartment in Kisauni, a slum outside
the ancient and bedraggled port of Mombasa, where Islamic and
African people of other religions have existed side by side for
centuries.
</P>
<P>
   Frederick Moturi, a real estate agent who rented him the house,
said Odeh had told him he was a fisherman who had dropped out of
engineering college after two years. ``I didn't see anything wrong
with him,'' Moturi said. ``To me he seemed like a good guy. Gentle.
Humble.''
</P>
<P>
   For three years, his family said, Odeh plied the fisherman's
trade. But he traveled frequently into Somali waters and brought
fish not only to busy ports like Malindi and Mombasa, but also to
less traveled ones known for smuggling, like Kiunga, Lamu, Ngomeni
and Kilifi. Sometimes he would be gone for a week at a time, his
relatives said.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, in 1996 he obtained a Kenyan birth certificate, and
then, in November of that year, an official Kenyan identity card,
which listed his hometown as Malindi and his date of birth as 1975,
according to copies of the documents seen by The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   He applied for a Kenyan passport in 1998 with these phony
documents. It remains unclear whether the Kenyan authorities issued
him one.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Odeh abruptly abandoned fishing, maintaining
life in Mombasa was too expensive, his family members said. In
January, he moved to his mother-in-law's simple house in the remote
northeastern village of Witu. He started a carpentry workshop,
producing ornately carved furniture, his relatives said.
</P>
<P>
   They said he frequently quarreled with them about religious
doctrine, especially prohibitions against tobacco and laws
governing relations with women. He read the Koran incessantly, and
was fond of quoting from it when he scolded people for their lax
adherence to Muslim laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a good man,'' said a younger brother-in-law, Ali Nassor
Salim. ``He used to be a very religious person and always likes to
give you advice about religion.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, at the family home in the Kisauni section of
Mombasa, his wife declined a request for an interview. Other family
members said Ms. Salim was convinced that her husband was innocent,
but she said she knew nothing more about the case than what she had
read in the newspapers. ``I am fine,'' she said, looking exhausted
and distraught. ``I can say nothing.''

 WHEN THE BISHOP FINDS HERSELF IN NEED OF PRAYER 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Earlier this month, when nearly 800 Anglican bishops from around
the world gathered at the Lambeth Conference, their once-a-decade
meeting in Canterbury, England, one of the more public faces seemed
to belong to one of the newer prelates, Bishop Geralyn Wolf, head
of the Episcopal Church's Diocese of Rhode Island.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop Wolf, one of only 11 women among the bishops at the
conference, was also one of a handful of prelates featured in a
film produced for the meeting by Trinity Television, of Trinity
Church in New York, that was shown in the conference's Bible study
sessions. In her segment, she spoke about the fear and grace she
encountered during a serious illness two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   As many people in her diocese probably remember, breast cancer
was diagnosed in Bishop Wolf in June 1996, four months after she
had become the first woman to be an Episcopal bishop in Rhode
Island (and the second ever to head a diocese in the
2.4-million-member church).
</P>
<P>
   She did not wait long to inform the 100-plus priests in the
diocese about her condition. Two days later, by coincidence, the
U.S. Postal Service issued a stamp calling attention to breast
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The Providence Journal-Bulletin noted the conjunction of the two
events, Bishop Wolf recalled in a recent interview. Through news
coverage, she found herself a public figure who not only was
experiencing suffering but also was expected to interpret it from a
religious standpoint.
</P>
<P>
   ``I decided it was really important to speak the truth on
this,'' Bishop Wolf said, ``and to take something that was hidden
and allow it to be revealed to a wider public. I also thought it
was a good opportunity to combine the realities of my own faith and
what I was going through.''
</P>
<P>
   Articles in The Journal-Bulletin chronicled her radical and
reconstructive surgery, followed by chemotherapy and recuperation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looking back on it,'' she said, ``I wanted to show perhaps a
different face to Christianity, one that was more realistic, that
could speak to the experiences people have and not be afraid of
those experiences.''
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Bishop Wolf said she thought it was not unusual
for people experiencing tragedy or suffering to feel as if they
were not dealing well enough with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``They feel as though there's a certain way to do it,'' she
said. ``I was trying to say that the only way I know is with a lot
of heartache and tears and doubts and anxieties, in the midst of
seeking God's presence. I didn't want to pretend that my
relationship with God relieved me of the very real experience of
heartache that I had.''
</P>
<P>
   During that time, Bishop Wolf said, she was sometimes frustrated
by well-meaning people who flatly assured her that she would
recover, because they were praying for her. She said she had felt
more comfortable with those who could be quietly supportive of her
``in the midst of my not knowing'' where the illness would lead.
</P>
<P>
   This, she said, came close to her idea of a healing ministry,
one that ``honored'' the experience of suffering and left open the
possibility that it might hold some meaning for the person
undergoing it.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop Wolf said she drew a distinction between such a person
and the sort who seems to enjoy suffering.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm talking about suffering that leads to life and that holds
within it hope,'' she said. ``That's different from those who want
to stay where they are.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, she said, she believes that the capacity to suffer can work
as ``an extraordinary gift'' to human beings, ``because it speaks
so much to our ability to feel deeply about life's experiences and
other people.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Her own experience may have sharpened her response to a moment
at the Lambeth Conference: Having attended a presentation about
African food shortages and violence that had left many children
malnourished and dying, she said aloud that she felt too
overwhelmed to speak. An African archbishop responded that no one
should be able to speak in the presence of such horror.
</P>
<P>
   Two years have passed since her surgery, and Bishop Wolf, who is
51, said that she had finally regained her strength after
chemotherapy and that her health was good.
</P>
<P>
   Women who know of her experience still stop her in the
supermarket in Providence to share their own stories. She listens,
she said, and tries to encourage them to seek support and guidance.
Once a week, she feels the need to go shopping in Boston, where she
will not be recognized.
</P>
<P>
   After she appeared in the film at the Lambeth Conference, Bishop
Wolf said she got a call from a priest who had been found to have
breast cancer and felt guilty that she could no longer meet her
parishioners' needs. That reaction, Bishop Wolf said, is not
uncommon in people with cancer.
</P>
<P>
   And it led her to offer another thought: ``People want so much
for the leader to be happy that it's hard to see the leader as
continually vulnerable.''

SEMINOLES TURN TO OLDER MAN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   By college football standards, Florida State quarterback Chris
Weinke qualifies as the sport's poster boy for the American
Association of Retired Persons.
</P>
<P>
   Make that ``former'' retired persons, in this case.
</P>
<P>
   Weinke, 26, spent seven seasons playing minor-league baseball in
the Toronto Blue Jays organization before deciding to take his
athletic career in another direction. That landed him at Florida
State, where a knee injury to projected starter Dan Kendra has
thrust Weinke into the starting lineup for Monday's matchup against
Texas A&AMP;M in the Kickoff Classic in East Rutherford, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Weinke's last start at quarterback came nine years ago, when the
St. Paul, Minn., native led Cretin-Derham High School into the 1989
state playoffs. That same season, a rookie quarterback named Troy
Aikman made his debut with the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   Suffice to say, Florida State coach Bobby Bowden never expected
to hear from Weinke again after his prized signee informed him that
he would skip school and accept a $375,000 signing bonus from the
Blue Jays, who selected him in the second round of the 1990
major-league baseball draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had players in the same situation where I thought, `I'll
see this guy in a couple of years,' '' said Bowden, who vowed in
1990 to save a scholarship for Weinke if he ever changed his mind.
``But I thought Chris would make it. I never expected to have him
back.''
</P>
<P>
   Weinke decided to resurrect his football career in 1996 after
batting .186 in 51 games as a first baseman for the Blue Jays'
Triple-A affiliate in Syracuse, N.Y. Club officials wanted him to
move to catcher. Instead, Weinke moved to Tallahassee, Fla., and
relishes his chance to lead No. 2 Florida State against No. 14
Texas A&AMP;M in the first national telecast of the college football
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't be happier with my decision. But it's hard to say
exactly what I'll be feeling on Monday night,'' said Weinke, a
sophomore who is older than 10 starting quarterbacks in the NFL.
``It'll be the first time I've started in nine years, so I know
I'll be excited ... and nervous. Anyone who says they're not
nervous in a game of this magnitude would be lying. I don't know
how I'll react.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither does Bowden, who watched Weinke (6-foot-5, 235 pounds)
complete seven of 13 passes for 82 yards in reserve duty last
season. Weinke ascended into the starter's role when Kendra
underwent reconstructive surgery after tearing the anterior
cruciate ligament in his right knee during the Seminoles' spring
game.
</P>
<P>
   During two-a-day practices, Bowden turned up the heat, freeing
first-team defenders to blitz at will in scrimmage situations.
Weinke withstood the pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not worried about him being under fire. He's been under
fire,'' Bowden said. ``He hasn't shown us anything where you'd
think he's not ready to play. I think he'll respond as good as you
could hope for a sophomore.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowden said his fondest wish is for Weinke to get ``a quick
taste of success'' against the Aggies to boost the confidence level
of a passer who has seen little game action since throwing for
3,956 yards and 24 touchdowns during 21 games as a high school
starter in 1988-89.
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;M coaches, who have little videotape of Weinke to study, are
unsure what to expect. On one hand, Weinke is untested at the
college level. He is coming off a long layoff from football and a
failed baseball career.
</P>
<P>
   But he is also mature and a millionaire, having turned his
signing bonus into a net worth in excess of $1 million through
investments over the past eight years. Because of his maturity,
Bowden said teammates have readily accepted Weinke as a team
leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you put him under pressure, a 26-year-old man is going to
react differently than your normal 18- or 19-year-old
quarterback,'' A&AMP;M coach R.C. Slocum said. ``But he's still new.
And any time you're doing something for the first time, there's
some apprehension involved. I really have no idea what to expect.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Johnson, the Aggies' defensive line coach, predicted Weinke
would not play his best game of the season against A&AMP;M because it
would ``take a little while ... to get the speed of the game
back.'' Toward that end, A&AMP;M will likely throw lots of blitzes and
stunts at Weinke early in the game to gauge his preparedness.
</P>
<P>
   Bring it on, Weinke said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not going to limit the offense because I'm at
quarterback, by any means,'' Weinke said. ``Obviously, it's the
first game. And there's always a few surprises in the first game. I
just feel comfortable with what I've studied and what I'm doing. I
consider this an opportunity for me to shine and that's something
I've been waiting for a long time.''

WHEN A JIHAD FLOUTS THE RULES 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JUDITH MILLER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Osama bin Laden, the renegade Saudi financier linked to the
recent bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, has
justified his call to kill Americans by citing Muslim holy law.
``Allah ordered us in this religion to purify Muslim land of all
nonbelievers,'' he said in an interview with ABC in May.
</P>
<P>
   Libya, Iraq and militant Islamic groups have also applauded the
bombings. Meanwhile, leaders in the Arab-American community and
Islamic specialists have argued that such terrorists have distorted
Islam's traditional teachings. And in a speech last week, President
Clinton made a point of drawing a distinction between Muslim
extremists and traditional Muslims _ the ``hundreds of millions of
good, peace-loving people all around the world,'' as he described
them _ who condemn the killing of noncombatants in terrorist
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   But just what does Muslim holy law say about these kinds of
terrorist attacks?
</P>
<P>
   Islamic holy law, or sharia, is based on the Koran and the
precepts and practices of the Muslim prophet Mohammed and his
seventh-century companions.
</P>
<P>
   Islam, of course, is open to many interpretations. But several
Islamic scholars who live in the West say that bin Laden has
justified his jihad, or holy war, against the United States by a
highly unorthodox, though increasingly common interpretation of
Islamic law and political tradition. Following in the tradition of
other 20th-century radicals, like Sayyid Qutb, the Egyptian
militant theorist executed in 1966, bin Laden argues that a war
against the United States is obligatory because of U.S.``crimes''
against Islam.
</P>
<P>
   These are often listed as America's presence on sacred Saudi
Arabian soil, support for rulers throughout the Middle East whom
the radicals say are ``un-Islamic'' and corrupt, Washington's
``blind support'' for what is characterized as Israel's ``theft''
of Muslim land and persecution of Palestinians, and supposed U.S.
indifference to the suffering of Bosnian Muslims. During his May
interview, bin Laden made a point of saying, ``After World War II,
the Americans became more aggressive and oppressive, especially in
the Muslim world,'' adding, ``We do not differentiate between those
dressed in military uniforms and civilians; they are all targets in
this fatwa.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Islamic scholars, however, argue that the holy war bin
Laden has declared violates not only the elaborate regulations of
Islamic law as traditionally accepted, but also Arab tribal custom.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Awn, professor of religion and Middle Eastern studies at
Columbia University, said that according to classical Islamic law,
a jihad must be fought for the ultimate good of the Muslim faith.
``It cannot be used simply for economic or political gain,'' Awn
said.
</P>
<P>
   According to mainstream Muslim jurists and scholars, there are
four kinds of legitimate warfare in Islam, including wars against
infidels and apostates, which are both jihads; all must be declared
and conducted by the Muslim ruler of a state, or failing that,
Islamic wise men. Bin Laden, of course, is not a leader of a state.
Nor is he a qadi, a judge, or a mufti, a Muslim legal scholar, Awn
added, and thus, is unqualified to issue what his supporters call
fatwas, his religious rulings or opinions justifying the
anti-American campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Quadir Amiryar, a political scientist at George Washington
University, agrees with Awn and notes that many of those who issue
fatwas don't follow the detailed procedures that Islamic law
requires.
</P>
<P>
   He also argues that spreading Islam ``by the sword'' is
traditionally considered a last resort. While it might have been
justified during the invasion of Afghanistan, he said, ``that
justification evaporated with the departure of the Soviet Union.''
True, many Muslim clerics in the Middle East and elsewhere have
interpreted Muslim law to justify terrorism, but Amiryar argues
that those calls for jihad often stem from frustration with their
own leadership: ``They are using these Islamic concepts in other
contexts which were originally not intended.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In his 1996 book on jihad, Rudolph Peters, a Dutch scholar,
argues that while the umma, or Muslim community, has a duty to
``expand the territory of the state,'' the doctrine of jihad
forbids, among other things, the killing of noncombatants like
children, women and elderly people.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, it would appear that even if Islamic law were stretched to
consider women and children at the U.S. embassies combatants, the
hundreds of Africans, many of whom are Muslims, who were killed
near those embassies could not be considered combatants.
</P>
<P>
   Muslim law also provides that ambassadors and their missions be
respected as long as they do not engage in espionage. (That's why
the Islamic government in Tehran insisted on characterizing the
U.S. embassy where hostages were seized in the 1970s as ``a nest of
spies'').
</P>
<P>
   Peters says a ``war against unbelievers may not be mounted
without summoning them to Islam or submission before an attack.''
In other words, people should be given a chance to embrace Islam as
their faith before they are killed.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden's defense of and reported ties to Egyptian and
Palestinian suicide attacks on Israeli and U.S. targets are also
questionable under traditional Islamic precepts, scholars say.
Islamic holy law forbids suicide. According to the traditions of
the Prophet Mohammed, which believers claim are divinely inspired,
the punishment is eternal repetition of the act by which a person
dies. So if a man hangs himself, he'll spend an eternity choking.
</P>
<P>
   But as Awn points out, Islam endorses martyrdom _ fighting, and
if necessary, dying for one's faith. And one Muslim's suicide might
be another's martyrdom.

EXPLODED DELTA ROCKET'S GUIDANCE SYSTEM FAILED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A guidance system failure caused Boeing's new Delta III rocket
to veer out of control and break apart about a minute into its
inaugural flight from Cape Canaveral Wednesday night, the leader of
the accident investigation team said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Rocket motors on the Delta III were trying so hard to steer the
wavering vehicle during its final seconds of flight that they
literally ran out of hydraulic fluid. The rocket then pitched over
more than 30 degrees and was ripped apart by aerodynamic forces and
its self-destruct system.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a car. When you don't have power steering you're in
trouble,'' said Clarence Quan, a Boeing engineer who is heading up
the investigation. He and others on the team spoke to reporters
Friday during a news teleconference at Cape Canaveral.
</P>
<P>
   Quan said engineers believe they will be able to fix the
guidance system problem _ once they understand it _ and launch the
next Delta III by February, which would mean only a four-month
delay in the program.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing has delayed Tuesday's launch of a Delta II rocket that
will carry 5 communication satellites for Motorola's Iridium
project.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the guidance systems on the two rockets are not the
same, engineers want a few more days to study the data from the
Delta III accident before going ahead with the Delta II launch from
Vandenberg Air Force Base in California.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's news conference was remarkable for its openness,
veteran aerospace journalists said. Usually, investigations into
the cause of rocket explosions are shrouded in secrecy, especially
when the booster or payload is military.
</P>
<P>
   But the Delta III program is entirely commercial, and that is
why Boeing decided to make the accident investigation as public as
possible. Delta III is the first large booster ever developed
through the private sector without government help.
</P>
<P>
   ``We intend to have an open investigation,'' Quan said. ``We
want to keep our customers informed ... and the public.''
</P>
<P>
   During the news conference, investigators also disclosed that a
large piece of burning rocket debris that witnesses along the coast
off Cape Canaveral saw hit the ocean and explode into an eerie,
orange mushroom cloud was actually the Galaxy X communications
satellite that was being carried into orbit for PanAmSat Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Because the piece was so large, there had been speculation the
rocket's destruct system did not work properly. In event a rocket
goes out of control, the destruct system is supposed to blow it up
into tiny pieces.
</P>
<P>
   But the satellite was blown out and away from the Delta III when
it exploded, said Roger DeVivo, a chief flight analyst with the Air
Force's range safety office.
</P>
<P>
   When the 4-ton, $200 million satellite hit the ocean about 15
miles offshore, it still had most of its internal fuel needed to
maneuver the satellite in orbit. That fuel resulted in a blast
equivalent to 532 pounds of TNT, DeVivo said. That is enough to
cause a mushroom-like cloud, he said.
</P>
<P>
   All the rocket pieces fell where they were supposed to, in an
area of the Atlantic that had been cleared of all boats before
launch.
</P>
<P>
   It was clear from the news conference that investigators have
collected a lot of data about what happened to the Delta III.
</P>
<P>
   The flight went as expected for the first 55 seconds, Quan said.
Then the Delta III began to oscillate. Over the next few seconds,
the rocket's main engine and three thrust-vectoring solid rocket
motors strapped to the side tried to regain control, but
overcompensated for unknown reasons. The three solid rocket motors
made so many corrections they used up all their hydraulic fluid and
the main engine alone was not enough to steer the rocket.
</P>
<P>
   About 70 seconds into the flight, the rocket pitched over and
broke up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know what happened,'' said Rich Murphy, Boeing's launch
site director. ``Now we've got to find out why it happened.''

TWO ACCOUNTS OF GIFT RETRIEVAL VARY, LAWYERS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Monica Lewinsky and Betty Currie, President
Clinton's personal secretary, have offered a grand jury different
versions of one element in the investigation of obstruction of
justice by Clinton, lawyers familiar with their accounts said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The contrasting accounts concern who told Mrs. Currie to show up
at Ms. Lewinsky's apartment last winter to retrieve gifts that
Clinton had given Ms. Lewinsky, the lawyers said. Mrs. Currie
testified that Ms. Lewinsky, a former White House intern, had
telephoned her and told her to come by and get the gifts; Ms.
Lewinsky testified that Mrs. Currie had simply shown up, presumably
having been told to do so by Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Starr, the Whitewater independent counsel, is
investigating whether the president sought to obstruct justice by
trying to conceal the gifts, including some T-shirts, a hat pin, a
brooch and souvenirs from New York and Martha's Vineyard, Mass.,
from lawyers for Paula Jones, a former Arkansas clerical employee
who had sued Clinton for sexual misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   As part of their unsuccessful effort to demonstrate that Clinton
and Ms. Lewinsky had had an intimate relationship, Mrs. Jones'
lawyers had asked Ms. Lewinsky to turn over any gifts she had
received from the president. The Jones lawyers wanted to
demonstrate a pattern of sexual misbehavior by him with
subordinates.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's advisers hope that the testimony of Mrs. Currie, who
has been cast before the public as an honorable witness, would tend
to support an interpretation that Ms. Lewinsky orchestrated the
transfer of gifts herself without the president's involvement and
that thus he did not obstruct justice.
</P>
<P>
   But the conflicts in testimony between Ms. Lewinsky and Mrs.
Currie may ultimately be less important than the conflict in
testimony between Ms. Lewinsky and the president himself.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton testified before the grand jury nearly two weeks ago
that he had told Ms. Lewinsky she had no choice but to comply with
the subpoena from the Jones lawyers to turn over the gifts, lawyers
familiar with his testimony said. Ms. Lewinsky has testified that
Clinton counseled her that she would not have to turn over the
gifts if they were no longer in her possession, other lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   As Starr's investigation moves toward its conclusion, Bruce
Lindsey, one of Clinton's closest and longest-serving advisers,
testified again before the grand jury Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The White House had tried to block the testimony of Lindsey, the
deputy White House counsel, on grounds that it would violate the
president's right to confidential legal advice. The Supreme Court
agreed to hear the matter after it reconvenes in October but
refused to order Starr to wait until then before hearing from
Lindsey.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In a related inquiry, Linda Tripp, the former colleague of Ms.
Lewinsky who recorded their conversations about a presidential
affair, was told when she bought the tape recorder that it was
illegal to secretly record telephone conversations in Maryland, The
Baltimore Sun reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun said that a clerk at the Radio Shack store where Mrs.
Tripp had bought the recorder had testified before the Maryland
grand jury that is investigating Mrs. Tripp for possible
wiretapping violations. The clerk, Antoine Burrell, 21, told The
Sun, ``I know she was told.'' He did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Tripp was an important figure in starting the investigation
of whether Clinton had a sexual liaison with Ms. Lewinsky and then
tried to cover it up. She took hours of recorded conversations with
Ms. Lewinsky to Starr, who quickly sought authority to expand his
investigation of the failed Whitewater land deal.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun reported that the policy of the Radio Shack store was to
inform all customers about the Maryland law.

   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
REAL kids have Christmas morning. Grown-up kids have college
football Saturdays, those wonderful afternoons when we fire up the
grills, wear the colors and mock our rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Is there anything more wholesome and fun than sharing a stadium
with 80,000 normally rational people, screaming passionately,
trying to will a 19-year-old from Cuero to score one for the alumni
or, better yet, the entire state? It is our favorite time of year,
and beginning today, 'tis the season. Christmas every Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, we even find a few gifts in the morning paper on
these days, like Colorado State getting 4{ points at Michigan State
today. It might not be a lock, but CSU is one of my dark-horse
favorites to go a long way in 1998. Take the Rams and laugh _ ho,
ho, ho _ all the way to the winner's circle.
</P>
<P>
   Which leads to why we are here today. It is not just to give you
today's news today but to offer a glimpse at the months ahead. May
we offer a Top 15 list of tomorrow's college football news today:
</P>
<P>
   1) Johnny Superflash, a middle linebacker for the 10-and-under
Pee-Wee Mites of Houston, will give an oral commitment to the
University of Texas in December as Mack Brown wraps up a strong 8-3
season and continues to wow the state's masses with sweeping early
recruiting efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Superflash, 4-11 and 92 pounds, runs the 40 in 6.6 seconds, and
his mother reports he has the vertical leaping ability to jump and
touch the top of every doorway in the house.
</P>
<P>
   ``This takes a lot of pressure off me,'' Superflash will say.
``Now, I'll be able to focus on my fifth-grade schoolwork. Hook
'em.''
</P>
<P>
   2) In the wake of news that Texas A&AMP;M scientists are working on
ways to clone a dog, only Reveille will show up at Monday's
critical Florida State game with a more nervous look on his face
than the Aggies.
</P>
<P>
   3) Ohio State Heisman Trophy candidate Andy Katzenmoyer will
pass the three summer courses he needs to stay eligible _ music,
golf and AIDS awareness.
</P>
<P>
   The final exams will range from having to name three of the
Spice Girls to an oral exam in which Katzenmoyer is asked if he is
aware of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' he'll answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Correct,'' the professor will respond. ``Now, beat Michigan!''
</P>
<P>
   4) Ohio State indeed will win the national championship, beating
Florida in the title game, thanks to Katzenmoyer's stupendous play.
Baby Spice dots the ``I'' at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   5) Texas star Ricky Williams will win the Heisman Trophy. But
Syracuse quarterback Donovan McNabb _ not UCLA's Cade McNown _ will
be the one making the race interesting.
</P>
<P>
   6) Alabama will win a couple of Southeastern Conference games.
This will be big news. Someone will notice the Big East Conference.
This also will be big news. Prairie View A&AMP;M will break its losing
streak. Huge news.
</P>
<P>
   7) Florida-Florida State will be the best game of the year. This
will not be big news.
</P>
<P>
   8) Someone finally will figure out the BCS _ Bowl Championship
Series, not Bryan/College Station _ three days after the game
actually is played.
</P>
<P>
   9) Notre Dame fans will file a suit against Bob Davie based on
age discrimination, the gripe being that this Irish team is again
too young.
</P>
<P>
   10) The Western Athletic Conference will splinter again, this
time forming three conferences _ those schools that want to break
away, those that don't and those that feel strongly both ways. This
new third league will be named the Clinton Republicans. Granted, it
won't be a big league.
</P>
<P>
   11) The Big Ten will make its best run yet at supplanting the
SEC as the top conference in the country. Still, the SEC will be
more fun. I'll take a Saturday afternoon at Death Valley, The
Swamp, Neyland Stadium and the like over anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   12) The Big 12 will not make a run at being the best league in
the nation, although Kansas State (North Division champs) and Texas
A&AMP;M (South) will do their share.
</P>
<P>
   13) The surprise powers this year will be Colorado State,
Arizona State and Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   14) The surprise flops will be Tennessee and UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   15) The local elevens will play better than you might expect,
the Houston Cougars winning six games, the Rice Owls eight.
</P>
<P>
   It will be a fun season. Like Christmas morning every Saturday
afternoon, as always.

CLINTON STRESSES IMPORTANCE OF SUMMIT WITH RUSSIA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: Changes last sentence before optional trim. No other
changes.)  
 (ATTN: Ariz., Ind.)  (lb) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich said Friday that
President Clinton's plans to visit Moscow next week to meet the
beleaguered President Boris Yeltsin were ``imprudent'' and should
be canceled.
</P>
<P>
   While some prominent legislators from both parties urged Clinton
to proceed with the summit meeting, Gingrich added his own
influential voice to those who have criticized the meeting, which
comes in the midst of economic and political upheaval in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are two weak presidents trying to prop each other up,''
Gingrich said in a telephone interview Friday. ``Who knows what
kind of promises they'll make to each other, what they'll agree to?
I think it's very imprudent for him to go.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton was undeterred, speaking at Martha's Vineyard,
Mass., about the importance of friendship in difficult times, and
vowing to press ahead with the meeting and with an effort to aid
Russia if the new government there did ``the disciplined, hard
things they have to do to reform their country.''
</P>
<P>
   Defending his trip, Clinton said, ``Anybody can come see you
when you're doing well.'' Clinton spoke shortly after Soviet
television broadcast an interview in which a puffy Yeltsin
announced that he would not resign his office.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton received support for the summit from Sen. Daniel Patrick
Moynihan, D-N.Y., who said that the Indian-Pakistani nuclear
confrontation in South Asia was reason enough for Clinton to go to
Moscow. The Russians could help with the Indians, he said, ``and
we've not had that conversation with the Russians.'' A
collaboration to make South Asia stable ``would cost a lot of money
but it's worth the world,'' Moynihan said. ``That alone would be a
good morning's discussion.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., also said Clinton was right to go.
``To cancel now would be a further blow to what little credibility
Yeltsin has remaining,'' he said. ``The president should obviously
tell Yeltsin to get a grip on his country and recognize that we
can't pour good money after bad without evidence of reforms.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., said that Clinton should stress the
U.S. desire for a prosperous Russia, fully integrated in the world.
``There is a sour mood about Russian in Congress today, principally
because of their missile and nuclear help to Iran,'' Hamilton said.
``We have to engage Russia and build bridges when possible, but
also draw red lines about acceptable behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   In a theme echoed Friday by his national security adviser, Sandy
Berger, Clinton said that the United States had to stand with the
Russian people in their time of difficulty and be willing to help
if the Russians themselves made the hard sacrifices required to get
their house in order.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although the key political and economic choices are up to the
Russian people themselves,'' Berger said, ``we need to engage
actively, even _ or especially _ in a time of crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton would urge Russians to hold fast ``to the basic
objectives of democracy and economic reform in the face of new
challenges,'' Berger said. ``The Russian people should know that,
particularly in times of difficulty, the United States and the West
will not turn away from cooperation. As they do the things
necessary to restore stability and progress, we are prepared to
support them.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's officials, struggling themselves to prepare for a
summit meeting in a land undergoing a political and economic
earthquake, had encouraging news Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian acting prime minister, Viktor Chernomyrdin, told
Clinton administration officials privately that he had made no deal
with the Russian parliament that would undermine the general course
of economic reform, senior U.S. officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Although members of Chernomyrdin's own party were saying
``worrisome things'' about a more Soviet-style state control over
parts of the economy, one U.S. official said, Chernomyrdin ``tells
us he hasn't struck any deal on the policy stuff.'' At least he had
not done so yet, the official acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   He spoke after a half-hour conference call among Clinton, Deputy
Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, who is in Moscow, and Deputy
Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers. Talbott emphasized that
Yeltsin would not resign, that Russian officials of all stripes
wanted Clinton to make the trip, and that the streets were calm.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``They're not sacking kiosks to get crackers,'' the official
said. ``It's not like Clinton's walking into a maelstrom.''
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin has been negotiating with Russian parliamentary
leaders, including the Communist Party, on a broad economic and
political strategy for recovery. Chernomyrdin, who controls
parliament's second-largest faction, needs wider support to be
confirmed as prime minister, in a vote expected on Monday, as
Clinton leaves Washington for Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   But Chernomyrdin also needs parliament to pass legislation to
reform Russia's tax and pension systems, at least if Moscow expects
the next $4.3 billion of aid from the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Senior officials said they remained deeply concerned that the
Communists would strike a high price, and that Chernomyrdin might
have to give some ground to the call for stricter state controls on
the economy and for more rubles to be printed in order to reflate
industry and pay workers, driving up inflation and further
undermining the value of the ruble.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chernomyrdin can go pretty far toward the Communists,'' said
another senior official dealing with Russia. ``We understand that
he needs to stabilize the situation in terms of public reaction. He
needs a coalition. That's the concern: He needs their support and
they'll make him pay for it. But he's a lot smarter than they
are.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the official said, Washington had no real options.
``We're prepared to be generous in our interpretation of what
Chernomyrdin can put together. But frankly, we don't have any
choice. We don't have any alternatives, nor is anybody asking us
right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Berger conceded that Yeltsin's firing on Friday of reformers
Anatoly Chubais and Boris Nemtsov was ``not encouraging,'' but he
continued to emphasize that the policies of any new government
mattered more than its personnel.
</P>
<P>
   Berger and other officials continued to press their theme of
fundamental Russian responsibility for the country's troubles and
for their solutions. But Summers also emphasized that the IMF would
be prepared to be flexible, depending on the pace of reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``That has to be put in the context of Russian economic policy,
which is what we're waiting to see,'' Summers said. ``And at this
point, we don't have a Russian economic team; we don't have a
Russian economic plan.''
</P>
<P>
   And Berger said that important foreign-policy and security
issues could still be discussed in Moscow, including nuclear
stockpiles, the protection of fissile material, and Russia's
policies toward Iraq, Iran and Kosovo.

CLINTON TELLS CROWD: `LOVE THY NEIGHBOR' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MCGRORY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDGARTOWN, Mass. _ President Clinton offered his tacit
forgiveness to independent counsel Kenneth Starr Friday while
continuing to seek forgiveness of his own, in a sharp reversal of
tone that has veered from defiant to contrite over the past two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to some of the nation's most prominent civil rights
activists, Clinton quoted the Bible, spoke in a soft voice, and
ultimately told the hushed crowd: ``Love thy neighbor as thyself.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All of you know, I'm having to become quite an expert in this
business of asking for forgiveness,'' Clinton said to applause and
laughter. ``It gets a little easier the more you do it. And if you
have a family, an administration, a Congress and a whole country to
ask you, you're going to get a lot of practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I have to tell you that in these last days, it has come to
me, again, something I first learned as president, but it wasn't
burned in my bones, and that is that in order to get it, you have
to be willing to give it,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The speech was given at a ceremony to honor Democratic
Representative John Lewis of Georgia, and to commemorate the 35th
anniversary of the March on Washington in 1963, when Dr. Martin
Luther King Jr. made his ``I Have a Dream'' speech. Lewis, who
recently published a book chronicling the movement, is the only
major speaker from the march still living.
</P>
<P>
   ``The anger, the resentment, the bitterness, the desire for
recrimination against people you believe have wronged you, they
harden the heart and deaden the spirit and lead to self-inflicted
wounds,'' said Clinton. ``And so it is important that we are able
to forgive those we believe have wronged us, even as we ask for
forgiveness from people we have wronged.''
</P>
<P>
   The words as well as the tone contrasted with Clinton's Aug. 17
speech from the White House Map Room, where he admitted his affair
with former White House intern Monica S. Lewinsky and struck back
at the independent counsel for the personal nature of the probe.
Friday, Clinton seemed to regret some of those words, indicating
that they hurt his own cause to be forgiven and move beyond the
Lewinsky probe.
</P>
<P>
   The conciliatory tone seemed to surprise some of Clinton's
senior advisers, who said they had not been told by the president
of his plans to use the speech to set a new course in his response
to Starr. The speech, while markedly more conciliatory, still fell
short of an explicit apology.
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton's closest confidant, White House deputy counsel Bruce
Lindsey, appeared before the Starr grand jury in Washington Friday,
Clinton awoke late in the morning, somewhere between 10:30 a.m. to
11 a.m., and began writing the notes for his speech by hand on two
sheets of paper, aides said. He continued to work on his outline
notes until about a half hour before he left for his midafternoon
speech. The gathering was held at the Union Chapel, a 129-year-old
nondenominational chapel that serves as a religious and cultural
center in Oak Bluffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have any idea he was going to say those remarks and
neither did anyone else on the staff,'' said Doug Sosnik, a White
House counselor and Clinton's most senior aide accompanying him on
the Martha's Vineyard vacation. ``That's the way he felt when he
wrote it.''
</P>
<P>
   Said deputy White House press secretary Barry Toiv: ``He got up
today and decided that's what he wanted to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's speech followed nearly two weeks of wrangling among
senior staff aides, Democratic lawmakers and political strategists,
most of whom agree that the president badly bungled his earlier
speech by striking back at Starr and failing to offer the public
apology for his affair with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   In that speech, Clinton said of the Starr investigation, ``This
has gone on too long, cost too much and hurt too many innocent
people.''
</P>
<P>
   The Oak Bluffs speech also follows an unusual conversation in
the presidential limousine in Worcester on Thursday afternoon, when
Clinton spoke with Senator John Kerry and Representative Jim
McGovern, Democrat of Worcester, and rued the four-minute speech
earlier in August.
</P>
<P>
   ``He expressed to me personally great awareness of the hole he
has dug and the need for him to build trust,'' Kerry said of the
limousine ride to the Worcester airport. ``He expressed it in very
personal terms, within his own family, with his countrymen.
</P>
<P>
   ``He expressed an awareness that it was probably a mistake to
come right out of the grand jury and go into a speech when he was
probably angry and edgy after a fairly exhaustive and tiring day,''
Kerry said. ``To try to talk to the nation as tired as he was
didn't allow him to put his best foot forward.''
</P>
<P>
   During that ride, as residents lined the sun-streaked streets
waving and holding signs, Kerry and McGovern both urged Clinton to
in some way present his case to voters in a more conciliatory way.
The three concluded that another speech would probably not be
politically wise, but that Clinton could address the issue within a
separate speech or respond to a question from a reporter.
</P>
<P>
   ``He clearly understands and recognizes that it is an ongoing
process, and I know he is prepared to make clear to people the
degree to which he understands that he bears responsibility in
creating the problem,'' said Kerry.
</P>
<P>
   Said McGovern: ``He seemed very remorseful, very regretful over
what has happened.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, in Worcester, Kerry seemed to take pains to
distance himself from Clinton, refusing to follow other members of
the Massachusetts congressional delegation in offering even a
carefully worded endorsement of Clinton or airing the hope that the
nation would soon move on. Friday, in a telephone interview, he
sounded more supportive, though still cautious.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel personally supportive of the struggle he is going
through,'' Kerry said. ``I hope he can work through it. The country
would be better off. We need to move on.''
</P>
<P>
   But he added: ``I don't think anyone can make any judgments.
There's a report that's going to be made and we don't know what's
in it. We'll have to exercise our responsibility. But that doesn't
mean on a personal level we shouldn't be supportive of the
president and his family.
</P>
<P>
   In his 24-minute speech Friday, Clinton's references to his own
situation took up only a few moments. In some respects, Clinton
drew a parallel between his own personal and political difficulties
and the civil rights movement of the 1960s. Both, he said, involved
forgiveness and redemption.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the towering chapel, filled with some 400 people, Clinton
appeared moved by Lewis and others, even wiping at his eyes as the
program concluded. At one point, he laughed uproariously at a Lewis
anecdote, tossing his head back and burying his reddened face in
his hands.
</P>
<P>
   The support for Clinton seemed widespread, even before the
president spoke. Charles Ogletree, a Harvard University Law School
professor and the moderator of the program, offered his unbridled
backing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the president has a lot of fair-weather friends,'' said
Ogletree, from the pulpit. ``This is not a fair weather crowd. In
difficult times, I want you to know that people here understand and
feel your pain. We believe in redemption and are with you through
thick and through thin.''

 Mother Jones magazine's liberals at odds   By Carol Emert  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
The 1960s and the 1990s have collided at Mother Jones, and the
liberal magazine lost its longtime editor as a result.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jeffrey Klein, a MoJo co-founder who has been the magazine's
editor and president for six years, tendered his resignation last
week, citing pressure from some board members to toe a conventional
left-wing line.
</P>
<P>
   Klein's departure, which becomes effective when his contract
expires next year, comes just as MoJo is preparing a high-stakes
marketing effort aimed at expanding its readership. The magazine
ran a $300,000 deficit last year and is attempting to boost its
subscriber base by more than 100,000 readers.
</P>
<P>
   The complaints by board members, which have grown more heated in
the last year, culminated in recent threats to withhold marketing
money for the launch of a redesigned magazine, the first issue of
which hit newsstands this week.
</P>
<P>
   Rob McKay, chairman of the board of the Foundation for National
Progress, which oversees MoJo, says he would never have allowed the
funding to be cut off. But Klein resigned a few days after the
threat was made.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt it was part of my mandate to take the magazine to a
place where it could be a useful journalistic force in the next
century,'' said Klein in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``To some extent that means accepting places where (the left
has) been successful and rejecting places where you've been a
failure.''
</P>
<P>
   Traditionalists on the MoJo board have questioned a number of
Klein's decisions, including last fall's publication of an article
that raised questions about affirmative action, a historic liberal
cause.
</P>
<P>
   The same people oppose a move by Klein to explore broad social
issues, such as Americans' interest in spirituality, rather than
adhering strictly to MoJo's historic bread and butter:
investigations of commercial polluters, backroom dealmakers and
other corporate and political ne'er-do-wells.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the opposition was led by Adam Hochschild, who
co-founded MoJo with Klein and several other journalists in 1976,
according to board members and other MoJo insiders. In the late
'70s, Klein and Hochschild worked together as the top two editors
at the magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Hochschild, a well-known Bay Area author and intellectual,
declined comment on the board debate, saying it should ``stay
within the family.'' However, he said, ``I really admire Jeffrey's
work at its best and I think he's made a strong and lasting
contribution to the magazine.''
</P>
<P>
   The rift at San Francisco's MoJo, a liberal standard-bearer
since its founding, reflects strains within the left in general.
From Washington, D.C., to Berkeley, liberals are divided over
whether to adhere to 1960s-rooted values or to rethink approaches
toward achieving the goals of feminism, affirmative action and
other causes.
</P>
<P>
   Resolving the debate is critical for Mother Jones and the left
more broadly as they attempt to woo today's young adults, a group
that has little identification with 1960s radicalism and exhibits a
strong distaste for dogma.
</P>
<P>
   MoJo is largely counting on people ages 18 to 34 to boost its
circulation from the current 140,000 to about 250,000 in the next
three to four years. Circulation peaked at above 200,000 in the
early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, 18- to 34-year-olds comprise only about 15 percent of
subscribers; the average age is 49.
</P>
<P>
   Greater circulation is also key to another MoJo goal: to become
less dependent on contributions to fund its $4.5 million annual
budget. Fund raising accounts for about one-third of the revenues
in the budget, subscriptions for half and advertising for 17
percent.
</P>
<P>
   A larger subscriber base would make the magazine more attractive
to mainstream advertisers, such as Apple Computer and General
Motors' Saturn division, which are ``attempting to differentiate
themselves with the unique identity of their brands,'' said MoJo
Publisher Jay Harris. Today, most ads in MoJo are for
``alternative'' products such as folk music CDs and herbal dietary
supplements.
</P>
<P>
   While the magazine's editorial direction is now uncertain, the
redesign and a simultaneous marketing effort were undertaken
specifically with young adults in mind.
</P>
<P>
   The issue's current cover story on Rupert Murdoch, for example,
spoofs Murdoch's sometimes-sensationalistic media empire, News
Corp. The profile, which accuses Murdoch of using journalism to
promote his business agenda, is printed on a tabloid-esque pullout
section that features the blaring headline ``World domination plot
exposed! Now, the inside scoop on Rupe!''
</P>
<P>
   Today's young adults ``realize that you're not likely to
overturn (institutions) with the French Revolution, so you deal
with it with satire and irony,'' said Klein, who believes the
current issue of MoJo is the best he's ever published.
</P>
<P>
   The renovated MoJo also includes a new column on marketing, an
area of particular interest to young adults. Its design is bolder
and more colorful. And it will focus less on Baby Boomer icons,
such as author Margaret Atwood, and more on people relevant to
youth such as radio talk show host Ira Glass.
</P>
<P>
   To jump start interest in the magazine, MoJo plans to spend
about $100,000 for outdoor ads this fall that will appear in major
metropolitan areas and college towns such as Ann Arbor, Mich. MoJo
editors will also lead political discussions at college campuses
this fall.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, today's young adults represent a natural following
for Mother Jones because many of them share a distrust of
institutions, both political and commercial, and concerns about the
environment that mesh well with the magazine's core readership.
</P>
<P>
   But Mother Jones will have to maintain Klein's tack if it is to
attract younger readers, said Viswah Marwah, a San Francisco
marketing consultant who assisted in MoJo's redesign.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine's circulation has grown by 30,000 since 1992, when
Klein became editor, and Marwah believes that with the new
marketing campaign and redesign, it can reach its ambitious
readership goal.
</P>
<P>
   But ``if you know what the article is going to say before you
read it, then you don't need to read it,'' said Marwah, founder of
the consulting firm Tattoo. ``Where Jeffrey is taking it now, when
he does a story that attacks the bastions of even the left, I think
that is surprising and not predictable.''
</P>
<P>
   McKay said the majority of board members support Klein's
direction and want it to continue under the next editor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The magazine will be broader than maybe some members of the
board have traditionally been comfortable with,'' said McKay.
``This brand, if you will, was built in another era, but the reason
I'm involved with the magazine is to try and make it relevant to
the next generation.''

TALKS STALLED BETWEEN BLAKE, KINGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Training camp starts in two weeks, and not only have the Kings
not signed Norris Trophy-winning defenseman Rob Blake, they appear
to remain millions of dollars apart following an all-day meeting
Thursday between General Manager Dave Taylor and agent Ron Salcer.
</P>
<P>
   Blake, 28, was honored in the past year as the top defenseman in
the NHL and at the Olympic Games in Nagano, Japan. But to this
point, the Kings have declined to tender an offer to Blake that
would make him hockey's highest-paid defenseman.
</P>
<P>
   Reportedly, Blake -- who earned $3.15 million last year -- has
rejected a $5-million-a-year offer that would have matched the
salary of St. Louis' Al MacInnis, the current money leader among
defensemen.
</P>
<P>
   According to Salcer, his client deserves to be not just the
highest-paid at his position but among the highest-paid in his
sport. Detroit's Sergei Fedorov has the highest salary for 1998-99,
$14 million. The Mighty Ducks' Paul Kariya and Eric Lindros of
Philadelphia will earn $8.5 million each.
</P>
<P>
   Salcer did not cite Fedorov as an example of the amount of money
Blake is seeking. But he did use Toronto center Mats Sundin, who
will make $6.35 million this year, as an example.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rob was a first-team All-Star,'' Salcer said. ``Only six
players made first-team All-Star. Look at a player like Mats
Sundin. He was voted eighth at his position for centers in the NHL.
Rob was the No. 1 defenseman. We think Rob's value to the Kings is
at least as great as any player to his team.''
</P>
<P>
   Salcer and Taylor both said they remain hopeful of reaching an
agreement in time for the start of camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be optimal,'' Taylor said. ``I think it's
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor also still has to sign enforcer Matt Johnson (another
Salcer client), goalie Jamie Storr, defenseman Aki Berg and winger
Steve McKenna. Reserve defenseman Jaroslav Modry agreed to terms
this week on a contract, terms of which have not been disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Salcer said a sizable portion of Thursday's meeting with Taylor
was spent negotiating a new deal - with little progress -- for the
6-foot-5, 230-pound Johnson, 22, who earned $400,000 last season.
The parties may meet again next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are not many out there like Matt Johnson,'' Salcer said.
``He's truly a feared player. When people come to L.A. and see the
lineup card, they don't like seeing Matt Johnson's name on the
lineup card. He makes a difference.''

 Brave Little S.F. Web Startup, Xoom, Floats $46 Million IPO   By Tom Abate  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
Braving the tempest in the stock market, a San Francisco Web
startup called Xoom floated a $46 million initial public offering
yesterday.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``That takes balls,'' whistled Charles Kaplan, president of
Equity Analytics, an IPO-tracking firm on Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   His assessment pretty much describes Xoom's entire 368-page
offering. Founded just two years ago, Xoom has created an online
community of about 3 million people by offering them free personal
Web pages, e-mail and other services.
</P>
<P>
   And although the company hasn't made a profit yet, its
prospectus calls Xoom ``the second-fastest-growing site on the
Web'' and professes that all this growth must surely yield
money-making opportunities through e-commerce and advertising.
</P>
<P>
   In the best of times, such a ``concept'' IPO _ that is, a
company with a good idea but no profits _ would be a risky
proposition.
</P>
<P>
   By going public in this gale-force market, Xoom hopes to signal
Wall Street that its concept is strong enough to brave the storm,
Kaplan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Typically, you only see the strongest offerings come out in a
down market,'' he said. ``The weak ones just don't get done.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Taulli, an analyst with IPO Monitor in Southern California,
said Xoom probably drew inspiration from the success of GeoCities,
a similar Web community that raised $80 million in an IPO earlier
this month _ on the same day the Dow dipped 112 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``For an IPO, the most important thing is to be in the buzz, and
the latest buzzword in Internet IPOs is `community,' '' Taulli
said.
</P>
<P>
   Xoom has experienced hands at the tiller. Chairman Chris Kitze
and chief executive Laurent Massa are tech veterans who know how to
make partnerships, raise cash and hire talent.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Xoom is in a quiet period, so the executives can't talk. We
can only guess that Kitze and Massa are betting Wall Street will
calm down in the 90 days or so it will take them to court
institutional investors.
</P>
<P>
   But can I float another speculative outcome?
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, Lycos, the evil search engine of the East, has
acquired two Web community sites. If the good search engines of the
West have developed community envy, they may well have dickered
with Xoom about acquiring it. Floating an IPO doesn't preclude such
deal. It merely puts a public deadline on any negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   But shame on me for speculating. The fact is, Kitze has started
and sold three companies in his career. All were private affairs.
So he's no stranger to such sellouts.
</P>
<P>
   The question now is whether, this time, he'll go all the way to
Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Busy signal? &LR;  High-tech execs are fuming that Vice President
Al Gore has refused to take their calls _ much less their side _ on
the volatile issue of raising the quota of foreign professionals
who can work in the United States under H-1B visas.
</P>
<P>
   With pro-industry legislation stalled in Congress by a White
House veto threat, Bay Area execs have tried to get their buddy,
Al, to get his boss, Bill, to lighten up. But when a
Hewlett-Packard exec phoned Gore's office recently, trying to
arrange for HP Chairman Lew Platt to chat with the Veep, the HP
exec was told to call the White House comment line instead.
</P>
<P>
   That's the same number you or I _ or an unemployed, over-40
programmer _ would call to blow off steam. But then none of us have
paid to attend all those Clinton-Gore fund-raisers.
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line: Gore won't escape if the tech lobby doesn't get its
way. ``If this bill fails I don't think he can be inculpable _ if
that's a word,'' one source said of Gore.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; In joke: &LR;  San Francisco artist Kathryn Siegler has taken a
humorous stab at the venture capital subculture in a cartoon strip
called the VC  &LR; (www.thevc.com). &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Siegler, who designs children's books for a living, created the
strip with her husband, Robert von Goeben. He reads business plans
and doles out money for Red Leaf Venture Management in Saratoga.
The couple moved here two years ago, trading L.A.'s music scene for
the Silicon Valley VC beat.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things I found funny was the language,'' Siegler
said. ``They bastardize these words and then use them in normal
conversation, like, `I can't fit you in today, I don't have the
bandwidth.'''
</P>
<P>
   After showing cartoons with themes like that to VC friends, the
couple convinced Upside Magazine to run the strip. Now they're
working on a humorous book on the same vulture _ I mean venture _
capital world.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I don't see such a book on America's coffee tables.
But maybe I lack the vision to see the business model. A publisher
could do a limited run for $999. Target Silicon Valley
millionaires, exclusively. There must be a gazillion of 'em
already.
</P>

 Assembly OKs Bill to Ban `Spamming'   By Jon Swartz  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
Adding legislative oomph to a growing anti-spam movement
nationwide, the state Assembly Thursday night overwhelmingly passed
a bill that would outlaw unsolicited commercial e-mail.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Legislation to Can Spam'' would make it illegal to send
e-mail from forged domain names and would allow Internet service
providers with e-mail equipment in California to sue junk mailers
for up to $25,000 a day in damages.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, which lawmakers sent to Governor Pete Wilson
yesterday, could become law next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bill sends a clear message to spammers: If you use the
systems of state ISPs to send pornographic material and
get-rich-quick schemes, you will pay a price,'' said Assemblyman
Gary Miller, R-City of Industry (Los Angeles County), who authored
the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Commercial e-mailers often ``forge'' their return addresses _
making it appear as if the message came from AOL or another popular
online service _ to trick consumers into opening their mail and to
avoid being traced. Many of these messages hawk sex sites, pyramid
schemes and miracle drugs.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 10 billion pieces of spam a year are clogging
Internet pathways and individuals' e-mail accounts, according to
industry observers.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer outrage has prompted a pair of high-profile
congressional bills designed to can spam and tag-team efforts by
Internet heavyweights to eradicate the problem.
</P>
<P>
   But so far, only two other states _ Washington and Nevada _ have
laws outlawing spam.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is by far the best spamming legislation in existence,''
said Justin Newton, San Francisco public policy director for the
200-member ISP/Consortium, which represents a dozen California
ISPs. ``It gives ISPs a stronger legal leg to stand on, and it
doesn't require consumers to get involved.''
</P>
<P>
   While the pending law would enable scores of California ISPs,
such as EarthLink Network, Netcom and Pacific Bell Internet
Services, to put a lid on spam, it is unclear if AOL _ the nation's
largest online service and one of the biggest in California _ would
be covered.
</P>
<P>
   Although AOL operates modem banks in California, its e-mail
server facilities are based in Vienna, Va. The Dulles, Va., company
has aggressively sued spammers to keep them off its service. As
much as one-third of AOL's 30 million messages a day are spam.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether or not we're protected, this is another important step
in curtailing spam,'' said AOL General Counsel George Vradenburg.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a start, but we need a national law to put an end to this
nuisance,'' Miller added.
</P>
<P>
   The Netizens Protection Act, sponsored by Representative
Christopher Smith, R-N.J., and now pending, would amend the
Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, which bans unsolicited
junk faxes, to also regulate junk e-mail. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In May, the Senate unanimously passed a provision of the
Consumer Antislamming Act, co-sponsored by Senator Robert
Torricelli, D-N.J., that would fine junk e-mailers up to $15,000 if
they mask their identities with forged addresses. The overall bill
prohibits the unauthorized switching of telephone service providers
for consumers.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, a coalition of Internet giants, led by AOL and
AT&AMP;T, in July submitted a report to the Federal Trade Commission
urging a major crackdown on spam. The Ad-Hoc Working Group on
Unsolicited Commercial Email is proposing that federal and state
regulators be given the authority to prosecute spammers who
disguise e-mail addresses.

 BofA Takes $220 Million Hit in Crisis   By Peter Sinton  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
Stock market investors are not the only ones rattled by the
financial fallout from Russia. Bank of America announced yesterday
that it will write off $220 million in the current quarter,
primarily the result of trading losses in Russia.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The charge, which reduces the bank's securities and foreign
currency trading profits so far this year by 41 percent, is the
largest hit taken by a U.S. bank in the crisis to date.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Republic New York Corp. said it would write off
$110 million for losses on Russian government bonds, wiping out its
earnings for the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   BofA said its write-off reduces its exposure in Russia from $412
million at the end of June to approximately $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers appear large, but the San Francisco bank generated
more than $1.7 billion in profits in the first half of the year and
only a tiny fraction of its $166 billion in loans were to Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, investors did not take the news kindly. BofA's
stock skidded $4.18 to $69.56 yesterday after dropping $3.88 on
Thursday. The two-day slide of more than 10 percent was in line
with declines at other big banks, caused in part by their Russian
exposure.
</P>
<P>
   Many investors are concerned about political uncertainty and the
impact Russia's problems could have on an already fragile world
economy. After all, U.S. trade with Russia barely shows up on the
financial radar screen.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. banks have lent $315.1 billion to foreign borrowers,
according to Federal Reserve Bank figures at the end of March. But
only $5.1 billion has gone to Russia. By contrast, U.S. banks have
lent $23 billion to Japanese borrowers and $6.5 billion to entities
in the Cayman Islands.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts applauded BofA's action. ``A number of money center
banks have exposure in Russia and now BofA has put Russia behind
it,'' said Van Kasper analyst Jeff Runnfeldt. ``The bank
essentially reduced its ruble-denominated debts to about 10 cents
on the dollar and is left with primarily secured short-term
loans.''
</P>
<P>
   BofA was not alone in owning up to recent losses in Russia.
BankBoston Corp. said it lost $30 million in trading so far this
quarter, including $10 million in Russia-related loans.
</P>
<P>
   J.P. Morgan said that losses from foreign exchange and
securities trading in Russia has reduced its trading revenue this
quarter, but it did not disclose the amount. The New York bank also
said that its total exposure in Russia is now about $160 million _
only about half as much as recent analyst estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Citicorp had $420 million in Russian exposure at the end of
June, but the bank has no plans to announce possible losses,
according to Bloomberg News. Billionaire George Soros' investment
funds have lost about $2 billion in Russian investments, one of his
fund managers told CNBC television yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign financial companies are also feeling Russian pain.
Germany's Deutsche Bank has close to $750 million of uninsured
credit risk to the Russian government and is raising its provision
for losses by an unspecified amount.
</P>
<P>
   Losses in the past two months, mainly from Russia, cut Credit
Suisse profits by $254 million, or about a third. And UBS, another
Swiss banking giant, said it lost $120 million in trading Russian
securities this month.

GROSJEAN MAKES IT HOT FOR BJORKMAN

<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ Who's feeding the cats and dogs back home?
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Larry Richard, far from the yips and meows of his
hospitalized patients, says they're covered, don't worry about it.
``I've taken my first weekday off in 25 years,'' he said Friday,
``because I've always wanted to see professional tennis players in
person.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard, a veterinarian from Andover, picked a good day to make
his spectating debut, and the best seat in the house at Longwood
Cricket Club to survey the MFS Pro Championships. Maybe Row Z,
Section 10 at the pinnacle of the south stand is the best seat
anywhere tennis is played, even though it's only general admission.
</P>
<P>
   Although the sun poked relentlessly from an azure ceiling while
a 20-year-old French outsider named Sebastien Grosjean burned
prime-rib seed Jonas Bjorkman to a 7-6 (9-7), 6-1 crisp. The Row Z
Zealots lazed happily behind a baseline and against the backrest
fence. The elderly oak of 80 feet that reaches out over the
grandstand is their shepherd, providing shade, and always
attracting natural AC: A leaf-riffling breeze.
</P>
<P>
   Lying directly below, the court is a rectangular jade overlooked
by the neighboring arboreal ramparts of Dunster and Middlesex
Roads.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so restful to sit here, in this bower, witnesses to
fierce battles down there,'' says Bunny Mahler from Needham. She
has sought out these sweet seats for more than 50 years, but
sheepishly confesses recently taking up golf to complement her
tennis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not old enough for that game, Bunny,'' says her friend,
Hyacinthe McKenna, from Dunstable.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly this perch beats anything at the forthcoming US Open.
Some might find Carlo aesthetically superior, where the handsomely
landscaped courts hang from the Maritime Alps and extend over the
Mediterranea.
</P>
<P>
   Wimbledon's Royal Box has its adherents. Diana was there often.
</P>
<P>
   Queen Elizabeth, who hates tennis, perfected a technique of
sleeping behind dark glasses while seated regally upright. But you

   ``What about Bretton Woods up in New Hampshire, the Mt.

His wife, Anita, nods and they stand up to display weathered

tennis hunker-downers from Natick, have learned that a cushion is a
comforting accessory for those braving Longwood planking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember,'' he says, ``how you sat on a hillside beside the
court, with mountains in the background?''
</P>
<P>
   Very, very pleasantly bucolic _ but, alas, perished. Killed by
an inability to generate enough revenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went to the Volvo a long time,'' says Anita. ``So far back
we can remember when Andre Agassi had hair. Lots of it. And he wore
blue jean shorts.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Richard, the tennis-playing veterinarian who knows about
dogs, is disappointed by Bjorkman's collapse, but doesn't call the
Swede a mutt or even a sick puppy. He sympathizes. ``Seems to be
having confidence problems after his terrific '97,'' is the
diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Ilene, in a nifty floral straw hat, and 11-year-old
daughter, Jodi, also play and were pulling for Bjorkman. But son
Corey, who is a restless 9, prefers soccer and looks like he might
climb down the oak tree to get outta here. Of course Corey approves
of the winner, Grosjean, when his mother tells him the name means
big jeans.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth Coomas of Dracut approves of the two guys appearing next,
reigning champ, 21-year-old Sjeng Schalken and Paul Haarhuis. Dutch
masters, she calls them. Haarhuis, 32, had said at lunch: ``We've
come to Longwood to play for the championship of the Netherlands.
How about that? Sjeng and I grew up 20 miles and 10 years apart.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday their tiny country wasn't big enough for both of them as
long-toothed Haarhuis revived to reach the semis, 0-6, 6-4, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   That may have inspired the Machiavellian master of spinning
surprises, lefty Gianluca Pozzi, the tour's Methuselah at 33.
Torturing Michael Chang with his sinister strokes for nearly two
hours, the Italian (No. 62) couldn't quite make it, 6-4, 2-6, 6-1,
so it wasn't totally Fickle Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Longwood wasn't big enough for its ambitions when the club moved
from the Back Bay to Chestnut Hill in 1922. Glancing over to the
right at club members playing their own games on the mini-mesa, the
terrace courts beside the stadium, Bunny Mahler wonders if a story
she heard some time ago is true.
</P>
<P>
   It seems that the terrace plot, coveted by Longwood to build
more courts and the stadium, was owned by Mrs. Saltonstall, mother
of renowned US senator, Leverett Saltonstall. She grazed a cow
there, and said she'd be willing to sell the property only when the
cow died. Soon it did.
</P>
<P>
   Was that cow poisoned by an overeager club member? In Section 10
none of the Row Z Zealots seemed to care about a suspicious bovine
death so long ago. They're just glad the stadium did rise here, so
that one day they could climb to their airy row with a view.

GROSJEAN MARCHES OVER BJORKMAN TO FACE CHANG IN SEMI 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM GREENIDGE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ Qualifier Sebastien Grosjean was feeling no
pressure Friday when he took on No. 1 seed Jonas Bjorkman Friday in
the MFS Pro Championships. After all, who'd expect the 96th-ranked
player to beat No. 12?
</P>
<P>
   Grosjean's laid-back approach worked wonders as he downed
Bjorkman, 7-6 (9-7), 6-1, to make the semifinals and a match
Saturday night against fourth-seeded Michael Chang.
</P>
<P>
   It might have been Grosjean's best outing since he defeated
11th-seeded Felix Mantilla in the first round of Wimbledon before
he eventually lost in three sets to Pete Sampras in the round of
16.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you play a guy who's better than you, you always play
better,'' said Grosjean. ``I woke up this morning and said that I
could win. There's no pressure. I have nothing to lose. You play
without pressure. I played a good match. I passed him. That's my
game, to stay in the back and pass.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been the case for a long time,'' said Bjorkman. ``I play
good for one or two matches, if I'm playing on a pretty good level,
but not good enough to win matches. That's a problem I've been
having. I can't maintain the tennis I've been playing for the first
two matches I had here.''
</P>
<P>
   Bjorkman simply has to fight for everything he gets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just didn't have the length on the shots,'' he said. ``I
wasn't really aggressive on the balls. He's a quick guy and I've
played a lot of guys who are really fast and quick, but I've still
been able to put away the volleys and I just couldn't do that
during this match. I didn't play at my best level, and when you
don't do that everyone can play tennis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have enough power in my volley. I wasn't aggressive
on it. I gave him a second chance on winning points.''
</P>
<P>
   In the first set, Grosjean had two mini-breaks and then held to
go up, 4-0. That's when Bjorkman started a comeback. Grosjean had
three set points, but he couldn't put them away. Two were on
Bjorkman's serve and one became a Bjorkman ace, followed by a
backhand winner as he approached the net.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was putting the pressure on me. He made two errors on easy
volleys, one on set point when he missed a point on a backhand,''
said the 20-year-old Grosjean, who was the world's No. 1 junior in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   On his fourth set point, Grosjean finally captured it when
Bjorkman banged a backhand volley into the net.
</P>
<P>
   In the second set, there were exchange of breaks in the first
two games. But Grosjean kept going, taking Bjorkman's serve in the
third and fifth games. Bjorkman was not thrilled with his service
game, especially on the first offering.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't do too much, he's hitting the ball back,'' Bjorkman
said. ``If you can overpower him, you will do it. He will not win
the match. I lost the match more than he won it. I neither made the
winner or I made the mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   In another afternoon match, Paul Haarhuis defeated practice
partner Sjeng Schalken, the tourney's defending champ, 0-6, 6-4,
6-3.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started out very sluggish and he didn't make any mistakes
and I didn't have any rhythm,'' Haarhuis said. ``My feet were very
tired from last night when I finished at 12:30 (in the morning) and
I didn't get to bed before 2:30, 3. Then it became a close match,
the way I thought it would be from the start. And in the third set
I felt I was the better player.''
</P>
<P>
   Chang defeated Gianluca Pozzi, 6-4, 2-6, 6-1. At 33, Pozzi is
the oldest player on tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had my fair share of trouble with him,'' Chang said. ``He
was playing some good tennis. He played consistent, not making very
many errors. For me in the third set, I tried to step it up and I
kept my errors down and I got the brace that I needed that set. In
the second set, I was impatient and I made some errors. Gozzi plays
with a lot of touch, a lot of feel, a lot of placement.''

WINNING BLACK VOTES IN A SENATE RACE  
 CLINTON SPOKE HERE (BUT NO NEED TO BRAG)  
 GOP CAN'T BANK ON HAWAIIAN WOES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Hawaii, Mo., N.C.)  (js) 
 By B. Drummond Ayres Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In Missouri, as in most other states, Democrats depend on solid
support from labor and blacks to give them a winning edge in
elections. In the case of Attorney General Jay Nixon, the
Democratic nominee in this fall's U.S. Senate contest, he has
labor's backing but has been struggling to win over black voters.
</P>
<P>
   Now that struggle may be paying off in this race that is being
watched more closely than most for clues about which party will
control the Senate next time around and by what margin. Nixon is
beginning to gather some black support and may be regaining some of
the impressive momentum he enjoyed when he first challenged the
Republican incumbent, Sen. Christopher Bond.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last 10 days, several top black leaders in the state
have begun speaking up for the attorney general, breaking with
other black leaders, including many top officers of the NAACP, who
refuse to forgive Nixon for once calling for an end to
court-ordered school desegregation. That break came after Nixon
said he had made a ``mistake'' by not communicating more closely
with Missouri blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon's new-found supporters include Freedom Inc., one of the
most influential black political organizations in Kansas City's
large black population, as well as two leading members of the large
black population of St. Louis, former Mayor Freeman Bosley Jr. and
the Rev. B.T. Rice, president of the St. Louis Clergy Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing that Freedom Inc. had decided to back Nixon, the
group's president, state Rep. Mary Groves Bland, said that a
comparison of Nixon's and Bond's records favored Nixon, whatever
his shortcomings on civil rights matters. Admonishing blacks who
have threatened to vote for Bond or stay home, including some NAACP
members, Ms. Bland said, ``You can be mad, take your marbles and go
home, or you can look at what will help our community.''
</P>
<P>
   Political pros rated Bond, a conservative, as ``vulnerable''
going into the race with Nixon, in good part because he only
narrowly won his two previous Senate contests. But Bond still holds
a fairly comfortable lead over Nixon, a moderate Democrat, in the
few polls taken thus far, and some political experts have begun to
say that he may well go on to a fairly comfortable victory in the
fall if the attorney general is unable to build on his recent
success in gaining black support.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to head off any more gains, Bond has begun spending long
hours working black precincts, political turf often bypassed by
Republican candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton Spoke Here (But No Need to Brag)
</P>
<P>
   In the action-speaks-louder-than-words approach to politics ...
</P>
<P>
   The morning after President Clinton made his Monica Lewinsky
speech, there was in the North Carolina General Assembly in
Raleigh, as everywhere, then and since, talk, talk, talk about what
it all means and what to do.
</P>
<P>
   A House member in a cluster of Republicans working over the
issue recalled a less portentous and lurid moment just 18 months
earlier when the president visited Raleigh and made a speech to the
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Another member recalled that after that speech, unbeknown to
most legislators, a small plaque commemorating the address had been
screwed to the House lectern that Clinton had used.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's go take it off!'' one Republican partisan cried out.
</P>
<P>
   Better to hold a vote on whether to take if off, a more politic
member of the almost evenly divided House suggested.
</P>
<P>
   It was all just talk. Nothing came of it.
</P>
<P>
   Not right then.
</P>
<P>
   But later, when no one was looking, the plaque disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   How? Who?
</P>
<P>
   The House clerk put out word that all it would take to expose
the perp was a quick study of the videotape in the security cameras
that keep watch on the House chamber.
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Cherie Berry, a Republican from Newton, in the
western part of North Carolina, came clean.
</P>
<P>
   ``I marched right in there and unscrewed that puppy,'' she
confessed to The Charlotte Observer on Wednesday. ``You don't have
to be a dentist to remove the plaque. With all that's gone on, I'd
rather have a plaque that says Billy Graham prayed here rather than
Bill Clinton spoke here.''
</P>
<P>
   The plaque is back.
</P>
<P>
   GOP Can't Bank On Hawaiian Woes
</P>
<P>
   Hawaii's 1st Congressional District, which encompasses Honolulu,
is normally solidly Democratic, as is just about all of Hawaii. But
Honolulu and the rest of Hawaii are suffering because of the
faltering Asian economy, unlike most of the rest of the country,
and as a result Democratic candidates all over the state are in
political trouble, particularly the 1st District's congressman,
Neil Abercrombie.
</P>
<P>
   National Republican leaders have put the 1st District near the
top of their target list. They have promised to throw in money and
manpower and whatever else it takes to steal away a Democratic seat
and strengthen the party's hold on the House.
</P>
<P>
   But on Wednesday Republican hopes for ousting Abercrombie
suffered a setback. State Rep. Quentin Kawananakoa, who was
expected to win the party's Sept. 19 primary, abruptly withdrew
from the contest, explaining that he was suffering from
hypertension, severe headaches and heart palpitations after an
earlier bout with strep throat and pneumonia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am unable to lead the winning campaign we all wanted,'' said
Kawananakoa, who is the Republican leader in the Hawaii House and
descends from the islands' royalty.
</P>
<P>
   His withdrawal left the other primary contender, state Rep. Gene
Ward, to carry the fight.
</P>
<P>
   In most recent polls, Ward did not run as strongly as
Kawananakoa in theoretical pairings with Abercrombie. For that
matter, in one of the latest surveys, Abercrombie showed surprising
strength against both men, beating Kawananakoa by 10 percentage
points and Ward by more than 20.

 &HT;    Rueful Clinton admits he's `expert' in seeking forgiveness
 &HT;    By Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARTHA'S VINEYARD _ President Clinton acknowledged Friday that
he has become an ``expert in asking for forgiveness,'' and he
seemed to be heeding the advice of his host, Georgia Democrat Rep.
John Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, who appeared with Clinton at a Martha's Vineyard church
to mark the 35th anniversary of the historic March on Washington,
said in an interview that he recently told Clinton ``not to hide''
from the Monica Lewinsky scandal, but to keep faith in the public's
ability to forgive.
</P>
<P>
   And while Clinton stopped short of offering an apology for his
admittedly inappropriate relationship with the former White House
intern, he said of asking for forgiveness, ``It gets a little
easier the more you do it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And if you have a family, an administration, a Congress and a
whole country to ask you, you're going to get a lot of practice.''
</P>
<P>
   And without naming independent counsel Ken Starr, whom Clinton
criticized in his short speech about the Lewinsky matter 11 days
ago, Clinton said in order to get forgiveness, ``you have to be
willing to give it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to tell you that in these last days, it has come home
to me, again, something I first learned as President, but it wasn't
burned in my bones, and that is that in order to get it, you have
to be willing to give it.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton cited South African President Nelson Mandela as one
example, commenting on how the leader of the anti-apartheid
movement did not hate the people who held him captive for nearly
three decades.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela, Clinton said, told him that at one time he did hate his
government captors, for they had beaten him, separated him from his
family and kept him from watching his children grow up. But,
Mandela told him that he had come to terms with his enemies. ``They
could take everything away from me _ everything _ but my mind and
my heart,'' Clinton quoted Mandela as saying. ``Now, those things I
would have to give away. And I simply decided I would not give them
away.''
</P>
<P>
   And if a person does not learn how to forgive in the same way
that Mandela did?
</P>
<P>
   ``The anger, the resentment, the bitterness, the desire for
recrimination against people you believe have wronged you, they
harden the heart and deaden the spirit and lead to self-inflicted
wounds,'' Clinton said. ``And so it is important that we are able
to forgive those we believe have wronged us, even as we ask for
forgiveness from people we have wronged. And I heard that first _
first _ in the civil rights movement: ``Love thy neighbor as
thyself.''
</P>
<P>
   Many in attendance saw the speech as an apology for the Lewinsky
affair. ``I think he is apologizing to the whole country,'' said
Flo Haynes of Michigan. ``But I don't think he has anything to
apologize for.''
</P>
<P>
   But Arline Tannenhaus does think the president has something to
apologize for. She is angry that she had to explain to her daughter
the details of the president's affair with Lewinsky. However,
Clinton's remarks at Union Chapel appeared to have won her over.
``I just don't look for the president to be my moral compass,'' she
said. ``I was angry with him, but now I forgive him.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, who has been unwavering in his support of Clinton, said
before the speech that it is time for Congress to focus its
attention on the nation's agenda, not on the private life of the
president. ``I think we should just cool it and talk about the
issues,'' said Lewis. ``We are all in this thing together. We need
him, he needs us.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to the president in a recent telephone conversation,
Lewis said that he repeated his mother's saying that ``we all make
mistakes and should be prepared to forgive.''
</P>
<P>
   And in what may have been a metaphorical reference to the
political storm he is now weathering, Clinton quoted from a passage
in Lewis' recent book, ``Walking With the Wind.'' In that passage,
Lewis recounts how he and his cousins attempted to prevent a storm
from sweeping away his aunt's house.
</P>
<P>
   ``And so it went, back and forth, fifteen children walking with
the wind, holding that trembling house down with the weight of our
small bodies. It seemed that way in the 1960s, at the height of the
civil rights movement, when America itself felt as if it might
burst at the seams _ so much tension, so many storms.''
</P>
<P>
   Pausing, a somber Clinton looked at the audience and continued,
``But the people of conscience never left the house. They never ran
away. They stayed, they came together, and they did the best they
could, clasping hands and moving toward the corner of the house
that was the weakest.

OXFORD PROJECTS $300 MILLION LOSS FOR YEAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Oxford Health Plans, the troubled managed-care
company whose stock has plunged more than 90 percent since last
summer, estimated future losses and took questions at its annual
shareholders meeting Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Oxford's new chief executive, Norman Payson, outlined a
turnaround strategy before a packed room of shareholders, many of
whom said they had lost thousands of dollars on their investments.
</P>
<P>
   Oxford expects losses, before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization, of roughly $300 million this year. While it expects
to break even on a cash-flow basis in 1999, Oxford is likely to
report a slight earnings loss. Its goal is an operating profit
margin of 4 percent to 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Payson emphasized that Oxford, whose popularity depends on
providing affordable health care plans that allow consumers to
choose their doctors, is committed to the plans and to its method
of paying doctors for their services. It will raise premiums and
cut some fees.
</P>
<P>
   Shareholders questioned Oxford's malfunctioning computer system,
which Oxford said would be fixed, not replaced. Marvin Rich, the
company's new chief administrative officer, stressed that Oxford's
problems resulted not from its computers but from a flawed strategy
of charging too little for its plans.
</P>
<P>
   Much rancor was aimed at Oxford's former chairman, Stephen
Wiggins, who was awarded a $9 million severance package. While that
package is under review by New York state regulators, several
shareholders expressed anger at the terms. Wiggins, who remains on
the board, did not attend the meeting.

3 STATES EXPERIMENT WITH AUTO CHOICE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., Pa., Ky.)   (For release Sunday, Aug. 30)  
 (Sidebar with SPEND-AUTO-INSURE)  
 (bl)  
 By PETER PASSELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   While federal auto choice legislation remains a long shot this
year, three states have adopted insurance systems that already give
drivers some discretion to limit their right to sue for pain and
suffering in exchange for lower premiums.
</P>
<P>
   None offer decisive evidence of how a full-blown auto choice
system would play out nationally, but each offers at least modest
insights.
</P>
<P>
   KENTUCKY _ The first state with ``choice'' _ its changes more
than a decade old _ hardly offers one. Those who choose to limit
their right to sue for intangible losses like pain and suffering _
the vast majority of drivers _ do not have to impose much
discipline on themselves. Lawsuits are permitted as long as the
injured party has medical bills of $1,000 _ a low hurdle, indeed. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Joint Economic Committee of Congress estimates that a switch
to a system that bars virtually all claims for pain and suffering
would reduce annual liability insurance costs in Kentucky by an
average of $134, or 38 percent. But with premiums already below the
national average, rates are not a significant political issue in
the state.
</P>
<P>
   PENNSYLVANIA _ This state's system looks a lot more like the
federal choice plan. Drivers who choose limited coverage must vault
a significant threshold _ having incurred ``serious injury'' _ to
be able to sue for pain and suffering. But full tort coverage
remains the default option; to get the limited coverage, drivers
must request it from their insurers.
</P>
<P>
   At present, the majority of drivers have full coverage, though
David Snyder of the American Insurance Association said that
insurers who make the effort find they can sell the limited
coverage to about half of their customers. Those who accept limited
coverage receive a 20 percent discount on liability insurance.
</P>
<P>
   NEW JERSEY _ As in Pennsylvania, drivers can choose limited or
full tort coverage. But the default option for those not specifying
a preference is the limited coverage. Roughly 85 percent of drivers
end up with limited coverage; to sue for pain and suffering, they
must meet a threshold that is somewhat weaker than Pennsylvania's.
Still, according to Snyder, drivers opting for the limited coverage
in New Jersey's competitive insurance market save 50 percent off
the price of unrestricted liability coverage.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey currently mandates a hefty $250,000 minimum of
no-fault personal injury protection. But under pressure from voters
to reduce insurance premiums, which remain among the highest in the
nation, the state will allow drivers to cut that coverage to just
$15,000 beginning next year. That should lure some uninsured
drivers back into getting required insurance, but the move could
undermine the thrust of the choice system: $15,000 is grossly
insufficient to compensate for many injuries, so it is likely that
more people will go to court to try to make good their medical
costs and lost income.

<P>
   While many mutual funds spend a lot of their shareholders' money
on splashy magazine ads and TV commercials, Meridian Value budgets
zero for marketing to investors. ``Our philosophy is to focus on
investment performance with the idea that good performance will
attract assets to the fund,'' said Kevin O'Boyle, the fund's lead
manager.
</P>
<P>
   As a marketing strategy, that clearly hasn't worked. Meridian
Value, started in 1994, holds a puny $12 million. Throw in the
value of stock grants, and that's what some of O'Boyle's peers take
home in a year.
</P>
<P>
   But the focus on performance has worked quite well for
investors. The fund has returned an average of 20.4 percent
annually for the three years ended Thursday, compared with just
10.7 percent for its peers in the small-capitalization value
category, according to Morningstar Inc., the Chicago financial
publisher. This year, Meridian Value managed a 2 percent return
through Thursday, while its peers lost 13.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   While Morningstar classifies him as a value manager, O'Boyle has
built his track record at the fund by identifying what he calls
``busted growth stocks,'' shares of fast-growing companies that
stumble. He became lead manager in June 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a company with a strong balance sheet and a history of
generating strong returns from capital fails to meet its earnings
estimates for a year, the stock prices tend to decline
dramatically,'' he said. ``We find this happens even if the
company's three- to five-year business outlook remains strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Meridian Value can invest in companies of any size but tends to
favor smaller ones; the median market capitalization of the
companies in the portfolio is $400 million. O'Boyle aims to spread
the fund's assets evenly among about 40 stocks _ he currently has
38.
</P>
<P>
   He will consider any company in any industry except
biotechnology. ``Those companies generally have no profit history
and often no revenues,'' he said. ``So we have a hard time valuing
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, he looks for companies with rock-solid balance sheets
and for industries with strong growth prospects. The fund has more
than 14 percent of its assets in retail stocks and hefty amounts in
consumer products, telecommunications, health services and
technology.
</P>
<P>
   Finding a busted growth stock is one thing, but before he buys,
O'Boyle also identifies a catalyst that will let the company
increase its earnings by more than 15 percent a year over the next
two years.
</P>
<P>
   One catalyst might be a shift in one or more industry trends.
For example, the fund owns shares of Tyson Foods and Sanderson
Farms, two poultry processors. This industry suffered from excess
capacity for years, O'Boyle said; shares of Tyson lagged behind the
market from 1993 through 1997, while those of Sanderson fell from
$19.25 in early 1997 to less than $12 in the fall of that year. But
starting last year, consolidation reduced industry capacity,
pushing up retail prices; meanwhile, the producers' feed prices
declined.
</P>
<P>
   He began buying both stocks last May, Tyson at $20 a share and
Sanderson for between $12 and $13. O'Boyle expects Tyson to earn
$1.25 in its 1999 fiscal year; the stock now sells for $17.625,
just over 14 times those projected earnings. Sanderson, at $12.25,
sells for under 14 times his 1998 fiscal-year earnings estimate of
90 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   A switch to a more effective business strategy can be a
catalyst, too, especially when new competition has beaten down a
company's stock. O'Boyle cited Discount Auto Parts, a
do-it-yourself car parts retailer in the Southeast.
</P>
<P>
   The company implemented a ``store clustering'' strategy, putting
many stores close together to fend off competitors like Auto Zone
and Pep Boys. The strategy reduced sales at individual stores and
cut earnings growth for the company in 1996 and 1997, but sales
started picking up earlier this year. The company is also starting
a commercial parts delivery service.
</P>
<P>
   O'Boyle expects Discount Auto to earn $1.90 a share in fiscal
year 1999; At $21.50, it trades for just 11 times those projected
earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Another example is Shoe Carnival, a 100-outlet discount retailer
that does business in the Midwest and parts of the South. It more
than doubled the number of its stores in 1993 and 1994, but had
problems: it sold too many low-margin private-label shoes and
struggled with a bloated inventory.
</P>
<P>
   By mid-1996, the company had eliminated its excess inventory by
cutting prices and used the resulting cash to pay down debt. The
stock traded at $5, just above tangible book value.
</P>
<P>
   But O'Boyle began buying shares only after Shoe Carnival rolled
out a strategy in the second half of 1996 to sell quality-brand
shoes at a discount. Sales in the company's established stores
began rising shortly thereafter, and O'Boyle held on, recently
adding to his holdings at $11 a share. The stock now trades at
$9.25. He expects the company, which trades at just over 11 times
this year's earnings, to earn 75 cents a share in 1998 and 90 cents
a share in 1999. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   O'Boyle keeps in shape by swimming two miles a day, four days a
week after work. ``Swimming gives me time to think and relieves the
stress from work,'' he said. He swims competitively with the
masters' team at the University of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   His proclivity for staying active shows itself on the business
side of his life as well. His fund's turnover rate is 144 percent,
versus an industry average of about 90 percent. He is quick to dump
companies that do not improve their operating results, or whose
stock price outstrips their business prospects.
</P>
<P>
   O'Boyle aims to stay fully invested, but right now, cash makes
up a steep 17 percent of the fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been having trouble finding companies with prospect of
improved operating results because the Asian situation has slowed
economic growth and the strong U.S. dollar has slowed export
growth,'' he said. ``The economy has been strong in the U.S. for so
long that few companies fall into our category of having operating
problems for one year.''

TRYING TO GATHER EVERYONE IN 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By SARAH BOXER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It sits in plush seats or on hard benches. It watches.
It claps. Sometimes it stands up and asks for more. Then it goes
home. Critics have spilled a lot of ink writing about actors,
playwrights, even directors. But what about the audience? Where has
it been and where is it going?
</P>
<P>
   Aristotle described the theater as an ``essentially religious
ritual,'' said Robert Brustein, the artistic director of the
American Repertory Theater. Euripides, Sophocles and Aeschylus
approached the Greek myths in a variety of ways, he said, ``and the
audience had the role of communicants.'' The right balance of
terror and pity would bring a collective catharsis, and they would
return home feeling cleansed.
</P>
<P>
   Describing the Greeks' theatrical sense, the playwright Arthur
Miller said: ``They used masks and music and scary stuff. There was
screaming and hollering and sometimes a guy sticking his eyes out
and bleeding on the stage.'' And that wasn't all. ``Those plays
were resoundingly popular works,'' Miller added. ``They were not
for a clique of theatergoers.'' A single play could move a city.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's quite a far cry from where we are now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Something momentous has happened to the audience. To illustrate
the change, Brustein recalled a scene in Virginia Woolf's novel
``Between the Acts'' in which some actors perform a pageant of
English history. The actors representing the 18th and 19th
centuries wear period costumes. But those representing the 20th
century simply hold up mirrors. As the audience looks at itself,
horrified, a record accompanying the performance gets stuck on
these words: ``Now we are dispersed. Now we are dispersed.''
</P>
<P>
   So the question becomes: how can such a diverse, dispersed
audience be moved? The various attempted answers form a brief
history of political theater.
</P>
<P>
   In his book, ``The Theater of Revolt'' (Ivan Dee, 1991),
Brustein described how the theater of communion represented by
Sophocles, Shakespeare and Racine was torn apart by the ``theater
of the great insurgent modern dramatists'': Ibsen, Strindberg,
Chekhov, Shaw, Brecht, Pirandello, O'Neill, Artaud and Genet.
Rather than allowing the audience to sit complacently, the modern
actors and playwrights incited the audience to change.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it appears, a new kind of theater has arrived that's
neither affirmative nor polemical, but instead seeks to bring
together the voices of society into a grand civic dialogue. This is
the kind of theater practiced by Anna Deavere Smith, who is best
known for her two one-woman shows based on street interviews,
``Fires in the Mirror: Crown Heights, Brooklyn and Other
Identities'' and ``Twilight: Los Angeles, 1992.'' Ms. Smith is now
the artistic director of the new Institute for Arts and Civic
Dialogue at Harvard University, sponsored by the W.E.B. Du Bois
Institute and the American Repertory Theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to bring disparate worlds together, not so that
we can all get along, but so we can see out of the `me' into `us,'
'' Ms. Smith said. And once again, the role of the audience is
changing. It is being assembled not to be affirmed or incited, but
simply to be represented.
</P>
<P>
   The evolution of the audience has come slowly. In Shakespeare's
time, Miller said, ``the play became a commodity,'' consumed by the
audience. And it remained that way through the 18th century.
</P>
<P>
   Audiences, witness to secular plays and sentimental comedies,
would weep a little and then go home happy. Basically, Brustein
said, those plays were confirmations of the audiences' values.
</P>
<P>
   The momentous change in theater came in the mid-19th century,
when Henrik Ibsen started writing plays that challenged the middle
class. Today, Brustein said, Ibsen's ``Doll's House'' might look
mild, but back then it was called a ``loathsome sore unbandaged.''
</P>
<P>
   The beginning of the modern theater of revolt presented
something of a paradox. ``Every modern play has tried to break down
the barrier between actors and audiences,'' to remove the fourth
wall so that audiences cannot rest secure in their voyeurism,
Brustein said. And what better way to do that than make them
uncomfortable? All the important modern dramatists saw no point in
putting on plays that did not challenge, alienate or push away
their audiences. But they knew they needed their audiences to
survive. They faced the classic problem of the avant-garde: How do
you offend people and keep them coming? And when they keep coming,
how do you keep offending them?
</P>
<P>
   Shaw's plays were offensive in length. They went on and on, with
prefaces, afterwords and postscripts. In its uncut version, ``Man
and Superman'' takes five hours to perform and that doesn't even
include the book-length afterword, with maxims for revolutionaries.
</P>
<P>
   Brecht had utter contempt for what he called ``culinary
theater,'' easily digested stuff. ``I aim for an extremely
classical, cold, highly intellectual style of performance,'' he
once said. ``I'm not writing for the scum who want to have the
cockles of their hearts warmed.''
</P>
<P>
   For Artaud, alienation was not enough. He introduced the world
to ``the theater of cruelty.'' As he put it: ``We are not free. And
the sky can still fall on our heads. And the theater has been
created to teach us that.'' He recommended that the spectator
accept the disorder and anarchy of life, that he use the theater as
``an outlet for repressions'' so he would not be violent or cruel
in real life.
</P>
<P>
   The followers of Shaw, Brecht and Artaud have gone in a hundred
different directions. One of the longest living descendants is the
Living Theater, the pacifist, anarchist theater group begun by
Judith Malina and Julian Beck 50 years ago. Following Brecht's
trail and adding some of Artaud's anarchic touches, the Living
Theater practiced ``total theater,'' Ms. Malina said. The actors
played themselves and the audience became part of the performance.
Everyone was ``forced to make choices.''
</P>
<P>
   Total theater reached a fever pitch in 1968 with a play called
``Paradise Now.'' During the performance, the actors ran naked into
the streets demanding ``paradise now.'' They were arrested for
indecent exposure and during one performance at the Brooklyn
Academy of Music Ms. Malina was raped onstage by someone in the
audience. ``If we're going to be brave,'' she said, ``we're going
to be misunderstood.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The Living Theater still performs ``Not in My Name'' in the
middle of Times Square whenever someone on death row is executed.
The actors celebrate the life of the victim at the hour of his
death, then go out to spectators, touch them, stare them in the eye
and say: ``I will swear to you that I will never kill you. Can you
promise me the same?''
</P>
<P>
   There have been many other instances of theater performances
that assault or embrace the audience. But these days, Brustein
said, most of the public is revolted by the merging of audience and
actors. The director Kenneth Tynan, Brustein recalled, said that
every time some actor came into the audience he felt like lighting
a match and burning his feet.
</P>
<P>
   Whether that means political theater is at an end depends on how
you define it. Athol Fugard, the South African playwright, says he
believes that every great playwright is political, from O'Neill to
Beckett. He adds, however, that there are only a few who still
practice what he calls ``resistance theater,'' plays intended to
bring down a system of government, like apartheid, by imparting
courage to the resisters and educating everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there is resistance theater in America,'' he
said. Why? ``With resistance theater it's one voice, a voice of
denial saying, `No!' '' Resistance theater, Fugard said, is only
possible when there is something great to resist. By that
definition, there isn't even resistance theater in South Africa
anymore. ``Going back to my own country,'' he said, ``there's still
a long way to go before we become the democracy we want to be, but
the work we've got to do is not in opposition to it, but affirming
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, every society needs a constant critique of itself. And
that is what many playwrights do. Fugard singled out Tony Kushner's
play ``Angels in America'' as ``incredibly powerful,'' but not
revolutionary.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics worry that critical theater has become fragmented
into so many splinter groups that each one is simply preaching to
the converted, offering each congregation its own catechism. Black
playwrights write for black audiences, gay playwrights for gay
audiences. Indeed, there are even troupes that adapt their plays to
fit the towns they are playing in, turning, say, ``Tartuffe'' into
something Texans can relate to.
</P>
<P>
   Brustein suggests there is too much emphasis on identity
politics in theater: ``A woman comes up to me and says, `I'm black,
lesbian and a poet. Who is speaking for me?' To her I say: `I'm
old, white and Jewish. And if I want someone to speak for me I look
in the mirror.' We are living in a time of such cultural narcissism
that we think we can only attend to something that is speaking to
our own concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Smith offers an evenhanded solution. Her idea is not to
focus on one voice but to represent them all. ``There is way too
much of the individual voice in theater,'' she said. ``The
limitation of most actors' training is that it is all about `me.'
'' With the Institute for Arts and Civic Dialogue, she said, ``We
are hoping to learn about the artist's relation to society. And we
are trying to transform the audience into a community. The question
is whether we as citizens can become an interesting collective
force.''
</P>
<P>
   To that end, she has put a lot of work into creating what she
calls a ``core audience'' for the institute's performances. This is
a group of 150 people of all different races and backgrounds who
show up for every show and become an extension of the cast. But she
is under no illusion that it is easy for a vast and varied crowd to
become unified.
</P>
<P>
   One theme of ``House Arrest,'' Ms. Smith's play about the U.S.
presidency, based on 4,000 hours of taped interviews with everyone
from prisoners to press secretaries to President Clinton himself,
is that, as she put it: ``We are living in a fractured community.
We are without a patriarchal guide and we're mad about it, mad
about not having a voice of authority.''
</P>
<P>
   At this point, though, she doesn't seem to think there is any
other choice. After all, we aren't communicants and we aren't
revolutionaries. ``We're not in any shape to be a harmonious
thing,'' she said. We're just the audience.

PURDUE DEFENSIVE END COULD SQUEEZE WELCH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVINE _ One of the biggest concerns for USC on Sunday is how
sophomore offensive tackle Matt Welch matches up against Purdue
standout Chike Okeafor, a former All-Big Ten selection who was
suspended last season because of grade problems.
</P>
<P>
   USC doesn't have a lot of information on Okeafor, who hasn't
played since 1996 and has since changed positions.
</P>
<P>
   Okeafor, 6-foot-5 and 250 pounds, has been moved from linebacker
to defensive end and could pose problems for Welch, who has never
played in a Division I game and has sometimes struggled with his
pass blocking in practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just, you know, I need to concentrate a lot more,'' Welch
said. ``(I'm) a little nervous, I guess. I'm pretty prepared.''
</P>
<P>
   Welch won't be alone in his unfamiliarity. Four of USC's five
starting linemen have never started a college game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're all pretty much in the same boat,'' Welch said.
</P>
<P>
   Big fan club: Sophomore linebacker Zeke Moreno expects to make
his first college start against Purdue, and his family is eagerly
awaiting it.
</P>
<P>
   Moreno has about 30 people attending the game, most of whom are
driving up from San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll practically be a reunion,'' Moreno said. ``All my aunts
and uncles. I told them I would be starting.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreno is starting because senior Mark Cusano is recovering from
a pulled hamstring and his playing time could be limited.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be just as nervous as any game,'' Moreno said. ``But it's
gonna be great. Since last year, it's been hard for me not playing.
My mom's been telling me to be patient.''
</P>
<P>
   Another person who will watch the game is his brother Moses, a
three-year starter at quarterback for Colorado State who is now
playing for the Chicago Bears.
</P>
<P>
   McCutcheon rests: Cornerback Daylon McCutcheon did not practice
Friday because he was bothered by allergies, but he said he will
play Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Larry's fine: Defensive end Lawrence Larry of Littlerock
proclaimed his sore ankle fit on Friday and said he will be able to
play. Hackett has not decided if he will start Larry or freshman
Ryan Nielsen from Royal High.
</P>
<P>
   Anniversaries: This season marks several notable anniversaries
for USC football. It's the 20th anniversary of the last national
championship team, the 70th anniversary of its first championship
team, and the 75th anniversary of the first USC football game at
the Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   Camp's over: USC officially broke camp in Irvine on Friday and
returned to Los Angeles. The Trojans will practice this morning at
the Coliseum while Purdue holds it workout this afternoon. Both are
closed to the public.

DENIAL, NOT OPTIMISM, PROPS UP SOME EMERGING-MARKET FUNDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Aug. 30)  
 (bl)  
 By RICHARD TEITELBAUM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The collapse of emerging markets has yielded plenty of detritus,
but none more curious than a clutch of closed-end stock funds that,
to the great misfortune of their investors, still hold stocks in
those cratered economies.
</P>
<P>
   While the stock markets of countries like Russia, Indonesia and
Thailand have so far this year fallen 83.2 percent, 15.6 percent,
and 41.3 percent, respectively, the closed-end funds that invest in
these markets are trading at steep PREMIUMS to their portfolios'
net asset values.
</P>
<P>
   Closed-end funds normally trade at a discount to net asset
value, and premiums are seen as a sign of optimism, which may seem
odd given the downbeat sentiment on these markets. And these are
not run-of-the-mill, single-digit premiums. They are giant,
record-breaking ones.
</P>
<P>
   Shares in Jakarta Growth, for example, changed hands for 25
percent more than the underlying value of the fund's assets Friday.
Its rival, the Indonesia Fund, traded at a whopping 72.8 percent
above its net asset value.
</P>
<P>
   Shares in the Malaysia Fund went for a 44.8 percent premium, and
the Templeton Russia fund traded at a 21.2 percent premium.
</P>
<P>
   The Thai Capital fund went for 27.5 percent above its net asset
value, but top honors went to the rival Thai Fund, whose premium
was an astonishing 92.1 percent. In other words, investors who
bought that day were paying $1.92 for every dollar's worth of
securities in the fund.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike their open-end cousins, closed-end funds issue a fixed
number of shares, which are bought and sold on stock markets like
shares of ordinary companies. They may trade at a premium or a
discount to the portfolio value. By contrast, open-end funds always
issue and redeem shares at net asset value; their share prices move
with changes in the value of their portfolios.
</P>
<P>
   So where could this recent spate of wild optimism be coming
from?
</P>
<P>
   There isn't any.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the prices of these funds have been skewed by a curious
case of shareholder denial. Having already held on through such a
disastrous selloff, they feel no desire to bail out now, even if
they realize that their battered shares are wildly overvalued
compared with net asset value. ``The philosophy of these guys is
that they have no choice but to ride it out,'' said David I.
Schachter, vice president of Thomas J. Herzfeld Advisors, a
closed-end fund research firm in Miami. ``It's because the losses
are so enormous.''
</P>
<P>
   But some people _ perhaps prompted by the fact that many of the
funds are trading in penny-stock territory _ are buying shares,
seeing them as bargains. ``You're really talking about the ones
that are at $2 or $3 a share,'' said Schachter's boss, Thomas J.
Herzfeld. ``They are pricing them like perpetual warrants on these
countries.''
</P>
<P>
   Ignorance on the part of investors plays a role, too, said
Michael Porter, closed-end fund analyst at Salomon Smith Barney.
``Many of them in this environment are totally unaware of NAVs,''
he said. Those interested in buying into any of these markets might
be better advised to seek out open-end funds or to buy the shares
or American depository receipts of emerging-markets companies, he
added.
</P>
<P>
   The premiums raise another question: Do they offer the chance
for a short sale, wherein an investor bets on a future decline in
the price of a stock, in this case expecting fund shares to sink to
reflect the value of the stocks in its portfolio? To sell the fund
shares short, an investor would have to borrow them from a broker
for a small fee and sell them. Then, when the share price declined,
he could buy them back at the lower price and return them to the
broker, taking the difference as profit.
</P>
<P>
   But closed-end funds are notoriously tricky to short. ``Most
brokerage firms would not lend stock to customers to short,''
Herzfeld said. Also, the relatively small float of such funds makes
it easy for others to engineer a ``short squeeze,'' buying up
enough shares to push the price higher and leaving the short-seller
with no choice but to buy shares at inflated prices to cover the
short position.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Don Yacktman has garnered quite a following over a three-decade
career as a value investor. But loyalty, alas, can be fleeting.
Investors have abandoned his flagship Yacktman fund in droves as
returns have sputtered.
</P>
<P>
   Assets of the fund have shrunk 46.6 percent, to $578.1 million
as of Aug. 27 from $1.08 billion in December 1997. The fund
returned 18.3 percent last year, well below the average 23.7
percent return for mid-capitalization blend funds, which may hold a
range of different-sized companies and tend to invest with a
combination of growth and value styles. The underperformance
continued this year: Yacktman dropped 5.8 percent through Aug. 21
while its peers eked out a gain of one-half percent, according to
Morningstar Inc., the Chicago financial publisher.
</P>
<P>
   Still, bailing out now is probably the wrong thing to do,
experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nature of concentrated funds is that they're volatile,''
said Amy Granzin, an equity analyst at Morningstar, referring to
the relatively small number of stocks _ 23 _ in the fund's
portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Stolper, a financial consultant in San Diego, said
investors should take a longer-term outlook. ``Our view is that
he's been less than optimal over the last two years, but we measure
performance over 10 years. What happens in shorter periods is
almost random.''
</P>
<P>
   The poor performance stands in sharp contrast to Yacktman's
earlier record as manager of Selected American Shares, which he ran
from 1983 until 1992, when he left to start his own fund company.
During his tenure, Selected American, a large-cap value fund, had
an annualized return of 17.6 percent, exceeding the 14.1 percent of
its peers and the 16.7 percent of the Standard and Poor's 500-stock
index. In 1991, Yacktman was named Morningstar's manager of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   He earned those returns using a disciplined approach to
unearthing out-of-favor growth companies with high returns on
tangible assets, few fixed assets and a high turnover of products
and services. Most important for Yacktman is how a company uses its
cash, a key point of departure from many value investors. The best
use of cash, he says, is reinvesting in the business or making
acquisitions that fit well with existing operations. He prefers
management that buys back shares. Less favorable uses, he says, are
paying down debt or paying dividends.
</P>
<P>
   In managing his new fund, however, Yacktman felt free to abandon
the big-company tilt he used so successfully at Selected American.
Over the past two years, he has sold off many large-cap holdings,
notably drug stocks like Bristol-Myers Squibb, Pfizer and Merck,
which he thought had reached full valuation, and looked for
opportunities in smaller companies.
</P>
<P>
   But the shift took place during a period when the market favored
larger stocks and the fund has suffered accordingly. With currency
devaluations and other global problems, ``a lot of people threw
money at America as a safe haven, not as a value judgment but as a
market judgment,'' he said. ``What was already overvalued became
more overvalued.''
</P>
<P>
   One prominent laggard, however, has been one of his remaining
big stocks _ Philip Morris. It accounts for 15 percent of the fund,
but is down 3.3 percent this year through Aug. 21. ``Philip Morris
is doing well on an earnings and cash-flow basis,'' he said, adding
that if the company's Kraft Foods unit were valued on the same
basis as another company, Heinz, that alone would justify the share
price. ``So you get the cigarette business, which accounts for
two-thirds of the business, for free,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He plans no changes to his portfolio, which he characterizes as
defensive.
</P>
<P>
   Yacktman started the Yacktman Focused fund in April 1997, and
the $59 million fund, which holds 13 stocks of various market
capitalizations, has trounced its older sibling. It has returned
11.3 percent annually, on average, since inception and is off 0.29
percent this year through Aug. 21, according to Morningstar.
</P>
<P>
   Yacktman, while currently invested in both funds, plans to put
his future money into Focused. ``We believe in concentrating to get
better results,'' he said.

COMMENTARY: TESTING WORTH, AND PATIENCE, OF TEACHERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DAVID GONZALEZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Austrian men and women who arrived in New York
City this week to teach public school math and science might have
to pool their salaries and share housing if they expect to be able
to afford an apartment. They could also turn to veterans of the
system to guide them in their search for a place to stay.
</P>
<P>
   Just don't ask Gregory Muriel, even if his house might soon be
available for new tenants. Muriel has been a public school teacher
for 15 years but has repeatedly failed the state's licensing test.
He has been allowed to continue teaching as a full-time substitute
teacher, but with a $12,000 salary cut, to $28,000. Now he faces
foreclosure on his New Jersey house.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in the process of filing for bankruptcy because of bills
that have yet to be paid,'' he said. ``It's humiliating. You try to
keep your integrity, but you see teachers throughout the city with
less experience than you getting paid more than you.''
</P>
<P>
   Muriel is part of a class-action lawsuit filed in 1996 by black
and Hispanic teachers who have been allowed to stay in classrooms
for years as substitute teachers even though they have not passed
their licensing exams. Some of them have lost tenure, seniority
rights and medical benefits while working the same hours at the
same jobs as licensed teachers; others have left the profession.
</P>
<P>
   The federal lawsuit contends that the general-knowledge parts of
the National Teacher Examination and its successor, the Liberal
Arts and Sciences Test, are culturally biased and have resulted in
higher failure rates for them than for white teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than look at how well they fill in the dots, they say,
why not look at how well they fill their roles as teachers? Their
experience with children from diverse backgrounds, poor families or
rough neighborhoods, they insist, should count.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now they're hiring teachers from Austria with no real
classroom experience,'' said Victor Acevedo, who has been a teacher
for 18 years but has yet to pass his licensing exam. ``We had
teachers from Spain who they brought here years ago. They spoke
Spanish, and they failed. What makes them think that teachers from
Austria would do any better?''
</P>
<P>
   Citing pending litigation, officials of the New York City Board
of Education and the state Education Department offered limited
comment on the class-action suit, which they have moved to dismiss.
A spokesman for the Education Department also said the test had
been extensively evaluated for any possible bias.
</P>
<P>
   J.D. LaRock, a spokesman for the Board of Education, said the
test was a valid requirement for teacher certification. ``Teachers
have five years to meet that requirement,'' he added. ``We think
that's a fair time frame in which to get their requirements
completed.''
</P>
<P>
   The teachers contend that the part of the test that has
repeatedly tripped them up sometimes seems little more than a
combination of factoids and trick questions. And while they don't
dismiss subject areas like literature and science, they say their
teaching duties prevent them from keeping on top of the test's
subject matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're good areas, but they're not my specialty,'' said
Acevedo, who is a bilingual social studies teacher at Seward Park
High School on the Lower East Side. ``The last time I took science
was in 1970. When you're in a classroom teaching in New York City,
it's not easy. You have a full range of responsibilities in the
classroom. All my time is spent on my lesson plan and classroom
management.''
</P>
<P>
   But coming during a week when the city's business leaders issued
a scathing report on the lack of skills among high school
graduates, those comments may prove unconvincing. Leaders of the
teachers union said they wanted to assist those teachers who have
yet to pass the test, but they did not accept the contention that
the current test is biased.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a hard call here,'' said Randi Weingarten, president of
the United Federation of Teachers. ``In a period of time when we
are demanding higher standards of our students and want to attract
the best and brightest, we have to make sure we are consistent and
demand high standards from teachers.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet teachers like Carolyn Lee ask why, if they are not
qualified, they continue to receive satisfactory reviews from their
bosses. Ms. Lee, a special-education teacher in the Bronx, has just
learned that she will be put on daily substitute-teacher status.
That means no guaranteed hours or benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel betrayed,'' she said. ``And I'm being thrown out the
door for the simple reason I didn't bubble in the right answers.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAK BLUFFS, Mass. _ Embraced by his most ardent supporters, an
emotional President Clinton said Friday that he had been wrestling
with the process of forgiveness _ both as a seeker of it from his
family and the nation, and as one who forgives his enemies.
</P>
<P>
   ``And so it is important that we are able to forgive those we
believe have wronged us, even as we ask for forgiveness from people
we have wronged,'' the president said, apparently in references
first to Kenneth Starr, the Whitewater independent counsel, who has
been delving into the Clintons' lives, and then to his wife and the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The anger, the resentment, the bitterness, the desire for
recrimination against people you believe have wronged you _ they
harden the heart and deaden the spirit and lead to self-inflicted
wounds,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The president's aides declined to interpret the remarks, which
came almost two weeks after Clinton spoke in a televised address
about his relationship with former White House intern Monica
Lewinsky. In the days that followed the brief address, Clinton was
widely criticized as less contrite than he should have been and too
eager to cast blame for his predicament on Starr. Since then, aides
have hinted he might make a more conciliatory statement.
</P>
<P>
   If Friday's words did not constitute the outright apology that
some critics have been demanding, they reflected a man who was
still navigating his way through the self-imposed crisis that has
tested his marriage and threatened his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was speaking to 400 people who had come to a simple
wood-shingled chapel here on Martha's Vineyard to commemorate the
35th anniversary of the historic civil rights march on Washington.
</P>
<P>
   His aides, who have said Clinton would refer publicly to his
personal situation in his own time and way, said they had no idea
he would offer these thoughts on forgiveness Friday. They said that
Friday morning he had rejected a speech written by his staff,
turning over the paper the prepared speech was written on and
scribbling his own thoughts in longhand.
</P>
<P>
   He continued to revise his remarks in his car on the way to the
chapel this afternoon and jotted even more as he sat on stage,
where he was bathed in support from black leaders, who have been
his most reliable constituents. The most recent New York Times/CBS
News Poll, conducted on Aug. 19 and 20, found that 94 percent of
blacks approved of the job he was doing, compared with 60 percent
of whites.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been with you from the beginning,'' declared Rep. John
Lewis, D-Ga., who played a central role in the civil rights
movement. ``And I will stand with you now till the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Ogletree Jr., a professor at Harvard Law School, said to
the president, ``All these times it was very easy for us to be with
you because you were with us, and now in difficult times, I want
you to know that the people here understand and feel your pain,
believe in redemption and are here because of you and are here with
you through thick and through thin.''
</P>
<P>
   Ogletree represented Anita Hill in 1991 when she accused Supreme
Court nominee Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment. Ms. Hill also
attended the ceremony.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The support came as some Democrats in Congress have been
expressing reservations about the president and publicly distancing
themselves from him, indicating an erosion in confidence among
those who may be asked to judge whether Clinton should be
impeached.
</P>
<P>
   His aides had agreed that he needed to offer the public
something beyond his admission on Aug. 17 that he had had improper
relations with Ms. Lewinsky, a speech that critics said expressed
too much anger at Starr and not enough contrition. There was no
indication from the White House as to whether Clinton thought
Friday's remarks would be enough to quell his critics, but the
president indicated he was in the midst of a process.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of you know,'' he said, ``I'm having to become quite an
expert in this business of asking for forgiveness. It gets a little
easier the more you do it.'' He said that seeking forgiveness from
his family, his administration, the Congress and the whole country
would give him ``a lot of practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he seemed to be taking the extraordinary step of
expressing magnanimity toward Starr, there was a residue of
defiance toward the prosecutor, whom he has made no secret of
loathing.
</P>
<P>
   It came in a reference to Nelson Mandela, the South African
leader who had been jailed for 27 years and still forgave his
oppressors. Clinton said that Mandela had told him his secret _
that he realized his enemies could strip him of everything but ``my
mind and my heart,'' a possible clue to how Clinton might handle a
public bow to Starr without giving in to him.
</P>
<P>
   Those inside the steamy one-room chapel here immediately
embraced Clinton. Ogletree cited black support for Clinton based on
favorable policies, including his appointment of minorities to his
Cabinet and judgeships, his ``historic'' visit to Africa and his
initiative on race.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to the wall with this president,'' said Henry
Louis Gates, the Harvard professor and writer and one of many
prominent blacks who vacation here. The Oak Bluffs section of
Martha's Vineyard, where the Clintons are vacationing for two
weeks, has served as a refuge for blacks since former slaves from
Virginia and servants of white Bostonians settled here more 200
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a great deal of voyeurism going on in the media and in
society about his personal life,'' Gates said. ``People are acting
like they want the man to bleed in public, and I think he's bled
enough.'' He called Clinton's speech ``a subtle, very sophisticated
thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis suggested it may have been too subtle. ``You had to read
between the lines,'' he said, but added that in talking about
Mandella, ``I think he was talking about himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hill, who has become synonymous with the issue of sexual
harassment, said: ``We do believe in forgiveness and we believe in
redemption. But I would love to see the president come out and do
something really positive for women. I think that's how we're going
to be able to get beyond this. This was a beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Gill, 40, a lawyer from Greenburg, N.Y., who has a summer
home here, said of the president: ``He has not fully dealt with
that issue and has a way to go, but I think he very much wants
forgiveness. He really needs to dig down in his heart, acknowledge
what he has done, acknowledge he has hurt some people, and then to
move on. His apology will be apparent by his actions, not
necessarily by a public statement.''

AMERICAN ORIENT EXPRESS: LUXURIOUS (BUT EXPENSIVE) RAIL
RELAXATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Aug. 30)  
 (duplication warning: also sent with `t' code)  
 (bl)  
 By TINA KELLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The American Orient Express luxury train, operating for less
than a year, already has its legends: the 94-year-old traveler who
has ridden it three times, the train buff who traveled across
Canada just so he could ride on an obscure 250-mile piece of track,
and the man who searches out the most expensive vacations possible.
</P>
<P>
   He probably felt right at home. An eight-night trek across
Canada or the United States in the Presidential Suite, which
includes a private shower, costs $7,890 a person, double occupancy.
Even the smallest compartments go for $4,990 on those runs.
</P>
<P>
   Operated by Oregon Rail Corp., the Express is the only fully
private passenger train running on the main rail lines in the
United States, said Henry Hillman Jr., the company's president and
owner.
</P>
<P>
   ``We consider it a cruise train, where you can live on board and
you don't have to unpack,'' he said. ``It's intimate, and it's an
opportunity to experience travel on a smaller space.''
</P>
<P>
   The train carries 15 cars built 40 to 50 years ago: seven
sleeping carriages, two dining cars, two club cars, two crew cars,
an observation car and a laundry. The cars were reconstructed,
their mechanical systems upgraded and their interiors refurbished
for about $1 million each.
</P>
<P>
   It's a graceful operation, paneled in Honduran mahogany. The
club cars feature painted ceilings and murals, plush carpeting and
faux marble walls, and the dining cars have inlaid portraits of
birds.
</P>
<P>
   Other elegant touches abound. A bottle of Mumm champagne chills
in each Presidential Suite and Godiva chocolates wait on pillows at
night. Rubrum lilies and long-stemmed red roses adorn the public
cars.
</P>
<P>
   In the dining car, the menu borrows from an earlier era of rail
travel, with dishes like venison chasseur from the Canadian Pacific
Railway and crab cakes with spicy citrus sauce a la B &AMP; O Lines.
</P>
<P>
   And the tours take travelers through some of the continent's
finest scenery, from the Canadian Rockies to the Deep South.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of a deluxe train for North America came from Swiss
investors more than a decade ago. They bought vintage rail cars
from museums, private collections and Amtrak and had them
refurbished, starting operations in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   That train, called the American European Express, stuck to a
Chicago-to-New York-to-Washington route as an alternative for
business travelers. But low ridership and an accident with a dump
truck caused the company to shut down soon after, Hillman said. For
four years, the train was used only for charter trips.
</P>
<P>
   The line came under its current ownership just last fall, when
Hillman said he and other ``venture capitalists willing to take a
flier on a new idea'' bought the train and its operations.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon Rail pays Amtrak and other rail lines for use of the
track, and contracts for the use of Amtrak and Canadian Northern
locomotives. The company aims to attract the richest 10 percent of
travelers _ people who might take cruises and who relish a relaxed
pace.
</P>
<P>
   The marketing of the train has also branched out to corporate
events, like a media tour for Subaru's introduction of its 1999
sport utility sedans. Other trip sponsors have been nonprofit
groups like the Smithsonian Institution and the National Trust for
Historic Preservation.
</P>
<P>
   The train travels from March through October, rotating among
eight scenic and historical tours around the continent, including a
``Jazz and Blues Express'' from Chicago to New Orleans, an
``American Heritage'' run from Montreal to Washington, a ``Rockies
and Yellowstone'' tour from Portland, Ore., and another national
parks trip, from Denver to Santa Fe, N.M.
</P>
<P>
   Nine routes are scheduled next year, and one more will be added
in 2000: a fall foliage tour of Vermont, New Hampshire and upstate
New York.
</P>
<P>
   Because of start-up and capital costs, the company is running at
a loss, but Hillman said he was confident that the train would
eventually be able to turn a profit, even at prices teetering
toward $1,000 a night. Indeed, he is assembling a second train of
vintage cars to run the routes.
</P>
<P>
   More than 5 million people in North America travel on cruise
ships each year, and 497,000 ride Amtrak's route down the Pacific
coast from Seattle to Los Angeles. So, company officials said, it
should not be too difficult to find 3,500 people to fill the
train's 35 trips next year.
</P>
<P>
   The Express carries up to 104 passengers, and, depending on the
route, has been running from 75 percent to 100 percent of capacity,
Hillman said. Several trips on the West Coast are already nearly
filled through 1999, he said.
</P>
<P>
   As passengers boarded earlier this month for the train's ``Great
Trans-Canada Rail Journey'' _ about 2,100 miles from Vancouver
through the Canadian Rockies to Montreal _ the crew stood at
attention in blue capes and white gloves. Each day, they provided a
meticulous itinerary, allowing passengers to pick out mountains,
ghost towns and waterfalls by watching for the numbered mile
markers along the track.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers could get out at some stops and explore the towns and
scenery. In Jasper, Alberta, for example, travelers could tour the
Athabasca Glacier off the Columbia Icefield.
</P>
<P>
   To break even, company officials said, most trips need to run at
about 75 percent of capacity but this particular run carried only
54 travelers. They ranged from mother-daughter pairs who had read
about the Express in Victoria magazine or seen it on a PBS program
called ``The Rockies by Rail,'' to corporate lawyers relaxing after
deals done, to couples celebrating anniversaries or birthdays.
</P>
<P>
   There were also train enthusiasts, known in the world of rolling
stock as ``foamers'' _ as in foaming at the mouth. These people
recognize locomotives by number and make comments like: ``So he
says you're an investor in his chooch.''
</P>
<P>
   One passenger, Frank Fairbanks of Pittsburgh, said he ranked
second among collectors of North American route miles _ at close to
250,000, not counting repeat trips. He once worked for American
Locomotive, an engine manufacturer, for a few years and loves
finding sections of track that he hasn't ridden before. On this
run, that meant 250 miles between Thunder Bay and Longlac,
Ontario. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another traveler, John Harmon of Lawrenceville, N.J., used to
take his wife, Elaine, on Friday-night dates to the Bethlehem, Pa.,
train station to watch the trains hook up. He worked for the New
York Central Railroad for five years as a computer programmer, and
has traveled from Berlin to Vladivostok behind a steam engine and
enjoyed ostrich for dinner on Rovos Rail, a luxury train that
operates in southern Africa. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Back at home, Harmon called the Canadian trek ``a truly
first-class, luxurious train-travel experience.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The food was outstanding,'' he said. ``I thought there were
very few things they could do to improve on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Company officials say train buffs do not make up a high
percentage of passengers. But Hillman thinks everyone is a train
buff at heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ask anybody if they like trains and train travel, and they all
love it,'' he said. ``But if you ask them when was the last time
they've done it, they don't recall at all.''

PEN LEADER IN MEXICO TELLS OF THREATS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JULIA PRESTON

<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Mexican novelist and poet Homero Aridjis,
president of International PEN, which defends freedom of
expression, said Friday that he had received a series of chilling
death threats.
</P>
<P>
   Aridjis, 58, is a leading opponent of the Mexican government,
which he has needled and challenged since 1985 as an
environmentalist and newspaper columnist.
</P>
<P>
   The hostile messages left on the answering machine at his home
here since last November are not explicitly political. But they
showed that the callers had access to information about his
personal life and movements that Aridjis says could have come only
from government officials tapping his phone.
</P>
<P>
   In one case Aridjis received a threat hours after a telephone
interview with a reporter from The Washington Post. The caller
repeated several phrases drawn directly from that conversation,
both Aridjis and the reporter, Molly Moore, said.
</P>
<P>
   The threats have come within days after Aridjis participated in
high-profile international conferences or gave press interviews in
which he criticized Mexican government policy.
</P>
<P>
   Since last December, Aridjis has traveled around Mexico City
followed by two bodyguards provided for him by the Mexican
government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pretty soon you are going to die like a dog,'' said one caller
on Nov. 27. A woman left a message just after midnight on Aug. 17
threatening Aridjis' two daughters and saying, ``And as for you,
you are going to die very soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Aridjis said, ``They are trying to create a perturbing
psychological effect, to interrupt my work.''
</P>
<P>
   He and his family left Mexico for several weeks in December
because they were concerned about the threats.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve writers, including Arthur Miller, Susan Sontag, Nadine
Gordimer and Edward Albee, sent a letter to President Ernesto
Zedillo on Thursday asking him to ensure Aridjis' safety.

RENEGADE CHALLENGER IN NEVADA GOP RACE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BRETT PULLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ The bodyguard who sits at the entrance of the
campaign headquarters of the gubernatorial candidate Aaron Russo
has few if any words for visitors who walk in. He just sits there,
way too big for his chair, incessantly spitting tobacco in a
Styrofoam cup. But his menacing presence befits the renegade
campaign of Russo, a rich Hollywood producer who swaggered into
town just two years ago and has become an intimidating and
unsettling force leading to next week's primary election.
</P>
<P>
   Although the polls show Russo trailing in his bid to win the
Republican nomination to succeed Gov. Bob Miller, his presence in
the race has turned what was expected to be a cakewalk for the
party's favorite into a competitive, and colorful, contest. The
Republican Party's favored candidate is Kenny Guinn, a 62-year-old
retired businessman and educator who for more than two years has
been considered the likely choice to succeed Miller, a Democrat who
is prohibited by state law from running for a third term.
</P>
<P>
   Although Guinn has the backing of the moneyed and muscular
casino industry, a funny thing happened on the way to his
coronation. Russo, 55, who has never sought public office and has
not voted since Ronald Reagan was in the White House, decided to
spend some of the millions he earned producing motion picture hits
like ``The Rose'' and ``Trading Places'' in an effort to upset
Guinn. And, surprising many here, Russo has managed to attract a
following among disaffected and anti-establishment voters.
</P>
<P>
   As a current favorite of the state's talk radio listeners, Russo
has insisted that Nevadans are paying too much in taxes, while the
casino industry _which for 18 years has paid 6 1/4 percent of its
gross revenue _ is paying too little.
</P>
<P>
   ``They own the state,'' Russo said of the gambling businesses,
which have contributed one-third of the $3.9 million that Guinn's
campaign has raised.
</P>
<P>
   ``Casinos contribute to all the politicians,'' he added in an
interview. ``So government does whatever the casino industry
wants.''
</P>
<P>
   Built like a meatloaf _ round and fleshy _ with a bone-crushing
handshake, Russo, at 5 p.m. on a recent 100-plus-degree day, talked
about his campaign as he quickly devoured a chocolate-covered
doughnut topped with candy sprinkles.
</P>
<P>
   He has refused to accept contributions from casino interests,
and in fact a $1,000 check from the Atlantic City casino owner
Donald Trump sat uncashed on top of his desk. He said he had no
plans to cash it.
</P>
<P>
   His campaign has raised only $30,000, but Russo has spent nearly
$1 million of his own money in an effort to match Guinn's hefty
spending on advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eight months ago, the prediction of most people was that Guinn
would just walk into the governor's mansion,'' said Michael Bowers,
who teaches political science at the University of Nevada at Las
Vegas. ``I don't think anyone expected Russo to do as well as he
has done.''
</P>
<P>
   Trailing by 41 percentage points in a poll conducted in June by
The Las Vegas Review-Journal, Russo closed to within 7 points in
another of the newspaper's polls conducted earlier this month.
Friday, however, the latest Review-Journal poll results show that
recent negative advertising by the Guinn campaign might be paying
off, as 51 percent of those surveyed said they would vote for Guinn
on Tuesday, compared with 33 percent for Russo.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt that seven months of pounding on Kenny by
Aaron Russo has probably cut a little bit,'' conceded Michael
Getto, Guinn's press secretary. But the latest poll results, he
said, are ``more in line'' with what Guinn's own internal polls
have indicated.
</P>
<P>
   The unexpected face-off between the Republican candidates has
also bolstered the chances for the leading Democratic contender,
Mayor Jan Jones of Las Vegas. Ms. Jones, 49, who entered the race a
few months after a diagnosis of breast cancer, has a comfortable
lead over her rivals.
</P>
<P>
   With the two leading Republican candidates attacking each other
in television advertisements, Ms. Jones has been able to stay on
the high road, running more positive advertisements. The television
commercial that has perhaps best defined the race and also helped
Guinn regain a comfortable lead in the polls is one that shows
footage from a 1994 video pilot that Russo filmed called ``Aaron
Russo's Mad as Hell.''
</P>
<P>
   In the video, the future candidate for governor, sporting long
hair and a dangling earring, unleashes a vitriolic attack on
government.
</P>
<P>
   The advertisement has ``been pretty effective,'' Getto said.
``It's overturned the rock a little bit to show what he's really
all about.''

IN GIULIANI'S CRACKDOWN ON PORN SHOPS, COURT RULING IS A SET BACK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS for comments from representatives for the porn shops and the
mayor's office.)  (js) 
 By DAVID ROHDE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A state judge dealt a blow Friday to New York City's
efforts to curtail the pornography industry, ruling that Show
World, a midtown Manhattan porn emporium, and two other adult video
stores can stay in business as long as no more than 40 percent of
their floor space and inventory are dedicated to adult
entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling by Judge Stephen Crane of state Supreme Court in
Manhattan breaks a long-running series of legal victories on the
issue for the Giuliani administration and suggests that the mayor
may achieve only a muted victory in his crackdown on sex shops. The
city said it would not appeal Crane's ruling, but it vowed to
continue trying to shut sex shops.
</P>
<P>
   While several strip clubs have already been shut down under the
new anti-pornography zoning law, Friday's court ruling indicates
that some adult video stores may be able to remain open by selling
non-adult merchandise in the front portion of their sales space and
reserving back rooms for adult entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   In trying to comply with the new zoning restrictions, the owners
of Show World, a 20-year-old, three-story business took advantage
of vague language in the new law that defined an adult
establishment as a business that devotes a ``substantial portion''
of its stock or floor space to adult entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Citing the Department of Building's interpretation of
``substantial portion'' as more than 40 percent, Show World and
other video stores replaced more than 60 percent of their ``triple
X'' videos, ``peep-a-live'' booths and other sex merchandise with
luggage, cameras, NYPD T-shirts and classic films. They then
declared themselves ``non-adult'' businesses to the court.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the city argued that the changes were a
``subterfuge'' by the stores to evade the new law, which bars adult
video stores and strip clubs from operating in residential areas or
within 500 feet of a school, house of worship or another sex shop.
</P>
<P>
   But in his opinion, Crane ruled that the changes implemented by
Show World, NRS Video and Les Hommes were substantial and make them
``non-adult businesses'' under the new law.
</P>
<P>
   It remains unclear whether sex shops that eliminate more than 60
percent of their lucrative pornographic merchandise can remain
economically viable, particularly in high-rent parts of Manhattan
such as Times Square.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Herald Price Fahringer, the lawyer representing 107 of the 144
sex shops affected by the law, said Friday that he believed that
the profit margins of the video stores might shrink if they
eliminated most of their sex-related inventory, but predicted that
many would remain in business.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Wexler, Show World's controller, said Friday that the
business had been forced to end all strip shows and lay off 20
people, including the dancers, since changing its inventory. But he
said the store was still making a profit and would definitely
survive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not operating in the red, but our bottom line has
definitely been hurt,'' he said. ``We're confident we'll be able to
keep going.''
</P>
<P>
   Steven Fishner, the mayor's criminal justice coordinator, said
the ruling would not affect the city's enforcement of the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``To date, 13 illegal establishments are closed due to court
orders and more than 20 others have voluntarily closed their
doors,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Crane's decision applies to Friday's case only, and it does not
present a legal impediment to future enforcement of the zoning law.

OVERSUPPLY DEVASTATING BEEF PRICES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (For release Sunday, Aug. 30) 
 
By NELSON ANTOSH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Dave Scott sums up in one word how his investment in
the cattle feeding business is performing _ ``horrible.''
</P>
<P>
   The experienced Texas cattleman describes the current state of
the business as a money loser for himself and others who fatten
cattle.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of growing steers and heifers to slaughter weight has
exceeded the selling price for at least a year, he says. Each
situation is a little different, but he estimates the break-even at
65 or 66 cents per pound.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison the average price paid for fattened steers in the
Texas Panhandle, the heart of the nation's beef production, dropped
to 57 cents per pound this week, the lowest since early May 1996.
</P>
<P>
   This translates into losses ranging anywhere from $15 to $200
per animal sold, depending upon such things as how much was paid
for the calf when it was bought from the rancher.
</P>
<P>
   The cause for the lower prices is an oversupply of beef, itself
brought about, in part, by the drought, a reduction in beef
exports, and competition from pork and poultry.
</P>
<P>
   The cumulative losses over such a long period of time may be
unprecedented and are eating into the beef industry's equity, say
some industry observers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty serious, there will be farmers and ranchers in
foreclosure over this,'' said Guy Walker, manager of Dawn Cattle
Feeders, near the Panhandle town of Dawn. ``It's been 25 years
since we saw losses of this magnitude. This is one of the worst
market disasters since the 1970s.''
</P>
<P>
   He was referring to the situation in 1974 when President Nixon
froze the price of beef and the futures price for live animals fell
the limit for seven days in a row, said Lindsay Davis, president of
Alamo Commodities in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   The feedlots didn't go out of business, said Davis, but a lot of
people stopped investing in feeding and never returned.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers are seeing some lower prices in the meat counters but
not as low as some of the feeders would expect.
</P>
<P>
   The National Cattlemen's Beef Association in Englewood, Colo.,
quotes government figures that the retail price for all beef,
including choice, select and ungraded cuts, was $2.54 per pound
during the first six months of this year, down from $2.71 per pound
five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   And the average price for choice cuts is the lowest since 1989,
the organization said.
</P>
<P>
   There have been some ``hot'' specials on beef througout the
summer and they will get even better for the Labor Day weekend,
said Gary Huddleston, spokesman for the Houston-area Kroger stores.
Prices will be lower than a year ago, he predicted.
</P>
<P>
   But feedlot operators like Walker and Jay Davis, general manager
of the Graham Land &AMP; Cattle Co. in Gonzales, Texas, don't think the
wholesale prices are really that low. ``Here we are giving cattle
away,'' Walker said.
</P>
<P>
   Packer buyers have been holding back because large supplies in
the feedlots work to their advantage, Walker said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Packers have found that the best way to defend their margins
is to not run wide open,'' he said. ``It's been very effective.''
</P>
<P>
   Packer giant IBP responds that all of its beef plants are
currently running 40 hours a week or more.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could increase production further;, however, we would have
no place to go with the additional product,'' the Dakota City,
Neb., company said in a written statement.
</P>
<P>
   The driving force behind current prices is oversupply, said IBP
spokesman Gary Mickelson. An estimated 16.7 billion more pounds of
beef, pork and poultry will be produced this year than in 1990, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Poultry production alone will be up by about 10 billion pounds,
followed by pork at 3.5 billion and beef at 3.2 billion pounds.
</P>
<P>
   There are several other reasons that prices for live steers and
heifers are depressed.
</P>
<P>
   Exports are down because the economic problems in beef-buying
countries in Asia reduced demand. Shipments to South Korea dropped
55 percent during the first five months, said Chuck Lambert, chief
economist for the beef association.
</P>
<P>
   The drought pushed thousands of calves off pastures into
feedlots in Texas _ the No. 1 beef-producing state.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a huge oversupply of pork, which competes with
beef in the meat case. The pig raisers are in much the same
situation as ranchers, mired in a meat glut.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's feedlots, with Texas far in the lead, are crowded
with grain-munching steers and heifers. Compared with a year
earlier, Texas added 14 percent as of Aug. 1 while Kansas and
Nebraska, the other two big feeding states, decreased slightly.
</P>
<P>
   Not only are there more animals in the pens, but they are also
heavier. The wheat pastures of winter and spring provided excellent
grazing, meaning that calves went into the feedlots at heavier
weights.
</P>
<P>
   And in a mass example of wishful thinking, many cattle owners
have been holding off selling in hopes that the market will turn
upward.
</P>
<P>
   Thus the number being slaughtered is off slightly but the
tonnage of meat produced is up. Cattle are being slaughtered at
record weights of more than 1,200 pounds each.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few extra pounds per animal adds greatly to the tonnage
in a country that slaughters from 33 million to 36 million head per
year, according to Lambert of te National Cattlemen's Beef
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Too many owners were sitting on their hands two weeks ago when
93,498 cattle were sent to slaughter, said Burt Rutherford,
spokesman for the Texas Cattle Feeders Association in Amarillo.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, even though the price was 2 cents a pound lower, a
relatively high 123,500 cattle went to the packing house. ``There
was no choice, they had to sell,'' he said. In the meantime the
animals gained about 25 pounds each.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to resist the temptation to hold on for one more week
in hopes that prices will improve, said Rutherford.
</P>
<P>
   ``They lose so much they don't want to sell, it's a
hope-and-pray kind of deal, '' said Walker whose custom feedlot in
the Panhandle feeds animals on a fee basis.
</P>
<P>
   But Scott isn't holding on for better prices. He sells when the
feedlot operator says the animals are ready. ``They're like
watermelons, when they're ripe you better pick them,'' said Scott.
</P>
<P>
   Scott's cattle are located in feedlot pens at opposite ends of
the state, in the King Ranch feedlot at Kingsville and in Cattle
Town at Hereford, in the Panhandle.
</P>
<P>
   He softened the blow of falling prices with some fortunate
hedges, locking in a price by selling ahead. But probably less than
half the cattle in feedlots are hedged. A number are owned by the
yards themselves, ``who are losing a ton of money,'' said Scott.
</P>
<P>
   The drought takes much of the blame for so many cattle in
feedlots in Texas. Calves were pushed off pastures when the supply
of grass ran out.
</P>
<P>
   The number of new animals coming into the feedlot during May and
June skyrocketed, said Gray, in Gonzales. They came from east of
Austin, the Tyler, Nacogdoches and the Sulphur Springs areas, in
particular.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wouldn't have had half that many if it hadn't been so
dry,'' Gray said.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of big grain crops in the Midwest is another reason
so many people are willing to continue feeding cattle. Holding on
for a week or two is less painful, and if feed goes down enough
they may be able to break even at some point in the future even at
58 or 59 cents.
</P>
<P>
   There is an old saying in the industry, said Lindsay, ``cheap
feed, cheap cattle.'' Cheaper feed also results in more pork and
more poultry.

FRITZ HABER, 86, SIMULATED WEIGHTLESSNESS OF SPACE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., Calif., Germany)  (js) 
 By FORD BURKHART   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fritz Haber, an aeronautical engineer who developed a way to
simulate the gravity-free environment of space in the training of
Apollo astronauts by flying a plane in a roller-coaster pattern,
died Aug. 21 at Norwalk Hospital in Norwalk, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Haber, one of the German scientists who were recruited after
World War II to work on the U.S. space program, was 86 and lived in
Westport, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   His technique for simulating zero-gravity was featured in the
movie ``Apollo 13'' during scenes showing astronauts floating in an
aircraft cabin, filled with terror and exhilaration. The scenes
were shot aboard a KC-135 NASA jet that would take deep plunges to
reproduce for sustained periods the weightlessness that astronauts
would come to know in their months-long trips into space.
</P>
<P>
   The future astronauts could walk on the ceiling, float inside
the aircraft and feel euphoric _ and sometimes they became
nauseous, which is why the training plane came to be known as the
vomit comet.
</P>
<P>
   Before and during World War II, Haber worked for Junkers
Aircraft in Dessau, Germany, where he developed a way that a
missile could be transported piggyback on another aircraft. He had
joined Junker, one of Nazi Germany's top aeronautics companies,
soon after receiving a doctorate in technical engineering from the
Technical University of Darmstadt. Haber was born in Mannheim,
Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The war ended before his piggyback design could be used, but his
idea was put to work by the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration to carry the space shuttle on a modified Boeing 747
from its landing site in California back to the launching site in
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Many scientists working in Dessau, in what would become East
Germany, were enlisted in the Russian space program after the
Russians occupied that region. But Haber was in western Germany for
the birth of a son and wound up in a zone controlled by the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   He later signed on with the U.S.space program, researching the
effects of space travel on humans and animals.
</P>
<P>
   In 1954, he joined Avco Lycoming, a producer of rocket engines
in Stratford, Conn. There he and other German engineers produced
some of the first gas turbine engines, including the T-53, which
was used mainly in the Bell UH-1 helicopter, known as the Huey. He
also became vice president for European operations.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Gigi; two sons, Jurgen, of
Washington, and Jochen, of Encino, Calif.; and a grandson.
</P>
<P>
   Haber's first wife, Lisa, died in 1958.

 &HT;    AS CLINTON HEADS FOR RUSSIA IN CRISIS, FOCUS OF AGENDA REMAINS
UNCLEAR
 &HT;    With TRIP-BOX-$ADV30.
 &HT;    For Use Sunday, Aug. 30 And Thereafter.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Early Friday, with the staggering Russian economy
careening through another catastrophic day and embattled President
Boris Yeltsin emerging from three tense days of public silence to
vigorously denounce rumors of his imminent resignation, National
Security Advisor Samuel R. ``Sandy'' Berger placed an urgent call
to President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking over a secure line from Martha's Vineyard, Mass., where
he's been struggling against long odds to have a vacation truncated
by scandal, airstrikes and global economic pains, Clinton wanted to
know one thing: should he scrap this week's summit in Moscow?
</P>
<P>
   Absolutely not, Berger counseled.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Berger insisted, Russia's economic and political turmoil
made it all the more imperative that Clinton be fully engaged, and
be seen by the Russian people to be fully engaged, in a crisis that
threatens to turn back the clock on a decade of hard-fought reform
in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   ''No one is nostalgic for the Cold War,'' Berger told reporters
later. ''And no one wants a weak Russia beset by crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   And so, diminished by scandal at home and convinced that pouring
new aid into Russia's failing economy has become a losing game,
Clinton leaves Monday for Moscow on a mission of commiseration with
the addled Russian leader.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is to spend Tuesday meeting with Yeltsin, speaking to
students and parents about the next generation of Russians and
attending a state dinner with the Russian leader. On Wednesday,
Clinton is scheduled to confer with a wide range of national and
regional figures, including communists and nationalists, as well as
reformists. He later in the week travels to Northern Ireland and
the Republic of Ireland, where a fragile, U.S.-brokered peace
process is struggling to gain traction.
</P>
<P>
   Where most state visits tend to be tightly choreographed down to
the slightest presidential utterance and move, Clinton's trip to
Moscow is a loosely scripted work in progress.
</P>
<P>
   It's unlikely there will be a Russian government in place when
Clinton arrives, after all, and even Yeltsin's position is
precarious.
</P>
<P>
   Surmised Russia analyst Thomas Remington of Atlanta's Emory
University: ''Clinton's going to have to improvise.''
</P>
<P>
   That may be a kind way of putting it.
</P>
<P>
   With polls showing that four Americans in 10 believe Clinton's
months of deception over his affair with Monica Lewinsky has left
his credibility too threadbare for effective leadership, and
Yeltsin's support fast dwindling to something like family members,
some analysts have already dismissed this week's summit as little
more than a desperate voyage of the politically doomed.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have, to different degrees, two discredited leaders who
are, in some ways, using each other to no concrete end -- except
maybe for their own ratings and popularity,'' said economist
Matthew Sherwood, a Russia expert with PlanEcon Inc., a Washington
consulting firm that specializes in the former Soviet states. ''For
Clinton, I think he's trying to look statesmanlike, and, for the
Russians, I think they want to make it look like it's business as
usual.''
</P>
<P>
   It isn't.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Yeltsin sacked his entire cabinet, claiming that
youthful Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko had failed to lead the
country toward a market-based economy capable of contending in the
global marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   Such political chaos broke the back of the Russian currency,
already lumbering from the sagging price of oil, the country's
chief generator of dollars. In less than two weeks, the ruble has
lost nearly half of its value against the dollar, despite heavy
intervention by Russia's central bank and last month's pledge by
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to provide $22.6 billion to
help prop up the battered currency.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers stampeded banks in hopes of pulling out rubles and
converting them to dollars while the Russian coin was still worth
converting.
</P>
<P>
   The government said it would not be able to repay its
dollar-denominated debt, and banks, threatened with collapse,
suspended some operations. This fueled further panic in a country
already reeling from nearly a decade of dislocation and diminished
output spreading from the loss of empire and the pain that has come
from shedding decades of communist controls in favor of the risks
and rewards of the free market.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, for the third day in a row, Russia's central bank shut
down trading rather than risk a ruble free-fall, as Yeltsin's pick
to head a new cabinet, former Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin,
met with opposition lawmakers to discuss new economic measures that
harken back to the communist era. He's got good reason to deal: the
Russian Duma, dominated by opposition groups ranging from
communists to nationalists, is scheduled to debate Chernomyrdin's
nomination on Monday. Weeks of discord are expected to presage his
confirmation, unless political fighting stalemates the process
completely.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials were quick to say they had no confirmation
that Moscow was considering a return to a centrally planned
economy.
</P>
<P>
   Even rumors, though, that Yeltsin was considering price
controls, massive ruble printing, artificially freezing the ruble's
value and perhaps even nationalizing industries only recently
turned private, were enough to elicit dark warnings from Deputy
Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, the administration's global
economic constable with jurisdiction over emerging markets gone
awry.
</P>
<P>
   ''A move back towards central planning based on price controls
and administrative allocation of goods,'' Summers cautioned,
''would be a serious policy error and very unfortunate.''
</P>
<P>
   Summers and Berger, who briefed reporters at the White House on
Friday, are part of the delegation accompanying Clinton to Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   They leave Monday for a summit that was scheduled in June, amid
hopes of resolving issues such as the future of the Serbian
province of Kosovo, where Serb troops last week added to weeks of
anti-Albanian bloodshed by murdering three aid workers ferrying
humanitarian supplies for an agency founded by the late Mother
Theresa.
</P>
<P>
   By Friday, though, the White House was in emergency mode,
worried about the continued viability of Yeltsin and the economy of
a country that less than a decade ago formed the core of a global
superpower that challenged the United States in virtually every
corner of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, White House officials voiced confidence in Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   Berger said he had ''absolutely no reason to believe that he's
not in firm control of the military and other elements of the
government.''
</P>
<P>
   Privately, however, officials are weighing a three-tiered
hierarchy of concern.
</P>
<P>
   Of greatest worry is the risk of a breakdown of law and order in
the world's second-largest nuclear power. Russia still controls
thousands of nuclear warheads and a vast arsenal measured in tons
of nuclear weapons material.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts need look no further back than last spring's
economically-triggered riots that paralyzed Indonesia and brought
the government of aging autocrat President Suharto to his knees for
an unsavory glimpse at what a descent into chaos might look like in
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ''People see turmoil in a country that has a lot of nukes,''
said Sherwood.
</P>
<P>
   Even absent a turn toward anarchy -- which isn't expected yet
can't be ruled out -- Russia's woes have compounded long-festering
U.S. fears that terrorists, organized crime rings, or some unholy
alliance of both, might get their hands on a Russian nuclear weapon
and use it, or threaten to, in the ultimate security nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   The second order of threat U.S. policymakers fear is the
overthrow of the Russian government, and its fledgling system of
democracy, by leaders who use the current political and economic
troubles to justify usurpation of power.
</P>
<P>
   ''The threat is that the army would combine with conservative
leaders and take power,'' said Remington, professor of political
science at Emory. ''We could get a suspension of the
constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   Failing such extremes, Russia could, finally, retreat from the
political and economic reforms it has struggled to embrace in the
six and a half years since the collapse of the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   That would represent a dramatic, and potentially dangerous,
setback of the twin pillars of U.S. policy in the post Cold War
world: the promotion of democratic governments and free-market
economies.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Berger sounded like a man already haunted by the
question: Who lost Russia?
</P>
<P>
   ``We have supported policies that we thought made sense,''
Berger said. ``President Yeltsin, after all, is the elected
president of Russia, twice elected by the people of Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a democracy, they get to make the decisions about the
directions that they take. But I don't think by any stretch of the
imagination one can argue that the current financial situation in
Russia is a result of U.S. actions.''

WEALTHY INDEPENDENT STIRS UP RACE WITH ANTI-PATAKI ADS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. _ B. Thomas Golisano is rousing a somnolent race
for governor like a drumroll of thunder on a placid day. If not
quite scaring anyone, he is at least getting people's attention and
threatening a little rain on Gov. George Pataki's re-election
parade.
</P>
<P>
   Golisano, a very wealthy Rochester businessman, is making his
second run for governor as the candidate of the Independence Party,
though his campaign was so quiet until recently that the average
voter would hardly have noticed it.
</P>
<P>
   But in the last week, he has been everywhere, leaping into the
race with an advertising attack on Pataki, a Republican, that is so
well-financed that Democratic Party challengers can only look on in
envy.
</P>
<P>
   Golisano, 56, has bought advertisements on every network
television station, every major radio station and nearly every
newspaper of any size across the state _ spending $4 million of his
own money, so far, in an effort that he says will grow to $10
million. The ads, without mentioning Pataki by name, accuse the
governor of fiscal mismanagement, noting the rise in state spending
and a sharp increase in state debt since Pataki took office.
</P>
<P>
   That has turned heads in a campaign whose only television
presence has been warm-and-fuzzy images from Pataki and the
Democratic front-runner, New York City Council Speaker Peter
Vallone.
</P>
<P>
   But can all that money improve on the 4 percent of the vote that
Golisano drew in 1994, when he spent $6.6 million? Unlike then,
when Gov. Mario Cuomo was wearing out his welcome, the incumbent
this year is popular, and voters show none of the anger they
displayed four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   As the candidate of a minor party that is just four years old,
Golisano must continually fend off questions about what he really
hopes to accomplish, the assumption being that his candidacy will
go nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal, our incentive here, is to get as many votes as we
can and to win the election,'' Golisano said at a campaign stop
Thursday in downtown Buffalo, where he announced a new round of
ads. He said he would begin next month to put out a detailed
platform, particularly on education. ``Just attacking and
discrediting is not enough to win,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some political analysts surmise that his real aim is to build
support for his fledgling party, whose platform is fiscal
conservatism combined with social libertarianism on issues like
abortion and gay rights.
</P>
<P>
   The real question, they say, is whether he will simply fragment
the anti-Pataki vote, burying any hope the Democrats might have, or
whether his relentless attacks on Pataki could help the Democratic
nominee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people speculate we take more votes from the Republicans,
we take more from the Democrats,'' Golisano said. ``I have no idea,
and frankly, I don't care.''
</P>
<P>
   John Zogby, a pollster and political analyst, says that the
success of third-party candidates relies heavily on dissatisfaction
with the incumbent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our polls show last time, his vote came 2 to 1 from Pataki,
because they were splitting the anti-Cuomo vote,'' Zogby said.
``This time, he's going to cut into the Democrat.''
</P>
<P>
   But for some Democrats, Golisano has emerged as an unexpected
political godsend. Cash-strapped Democrats could not afford the
kind of attack in the news media that Golisano has mounted against
Pataki, in which ads strike at the heart of the governor's record
and his claim to being a fiscal conservative who has tamed Albany's
excesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he spends millions of dollars attacking George Pataki, one
would think that can't be good for George Pataki,'' said David
Eichenbaum, a Democratic campaign consultant. ``It could provide an
opportunity for a Democrat.''
</P>
<P>
   Zenia Mucha, Pataki's campaign manager, said she was not
concerned by Golisano's ads, whose message she disputed.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mucha said she expected him to be no more a factor in this
race than in the last one.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very risky thing to underestimate the intelligence of
the voter,'' she said. ``And having a person who's willing to spend
millions of dollars to disseminate a message that is not true does
not make people think it's true.''
</P>
<P>
   Golisano says that he knows little about the leading Democratic
contenders, Vallone and Lt. Gov. Betsy McCaughey Ross, and that he
has no plans to turn his sights on them.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Golisano had the endorsement of Ross Perot and the
support of Perot's Reform Party. In the space of just a few weeks
that fall, his deeply tanned face, framed by silver curls, became a
familiar sight to New Yorkers. He drew more than 217,000 votes,
well above the 50,000 needed to win the Independence Party an
automatic place on state ballots for the next four years.
</P>
<P>
   But it is questionable whether the party, without Golisano's
name recognition and deep pockets, would have been able to top
50,000 this year. Early this year, Golisano did not seem eager to
run again, but the party leaned hard on him to be its
standard-bearer.
</P>
<P>
   Golisano's wealth stems from a chance he took in 1971, when he
was a 29-year-old employee of a payroll processing company. He
looked around his workplace and decided he could do a better job
than his bosses.
</P>
<P>
   He quit his job and founded his own payroll company, Paychex. He
focused on the small employers that he saw other payroll processors
ignoring, and now 300,000 of them are clients.
</P>
<P>
   Golisano's stake in Paychex, which went public in 1983, is worth
about $600 million, and he has large holdings in several other
companies. Asked if he was a billionaire, he said no, but that he
was close. He is on the Forbes magazine list of the 400 richest
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   His quest to be governor follows essentially the same story line
as the one he used in his business life: he sees how state
government runs and thinks he can improve on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mentors have all been negative,'' Golisano said in an
interview. ``I saw a lot of people doing things wrong, and that
inspires me.''
</P>
<P>
   Tycoons-cum-politicians frequently find the going rocky, at
best, as Perot, Lew Lehrman and Al Checchi can attest. They are
debilitated by the press scrutiny, the constant second-guessing of
their actions and motives, the need for building a consensus and
their own unwillingness to keep some thoughts to themselves.
</P>
<P>
   But Golisano has the unruffled confidence of the self-made man,
and as others before him who made the foray into politics, he
insists that all government needs is a dose of business-style
management. Referring, for example, to the partial takeover of Long
Island Lighting Co. advocated by Mr. Pataki, he said, ``No business
would have made that deal.''
</P>
<P>
   He cheerfully admits his ignorance in many policy areas, but
suggests in the next breath that it does not matter. Of the state's
high Medicaid costs, he said, ``I don't pretend to be an expert in
that area, but something that large, there's got to be room to
cut.''
</P>
<P>
   The cost of public schooling in New York state, minus teachers'
salaries and benefits, is about $200,000 per classroom, he said.
``Where's the other $200,000 going?'' he asked. ``I seriously don't
know the answer to that question, but we'd better find out.''
</P>
<P>
   Golisano concedes that most social issues do not concern him
much. He says he favors abortion rights because ``most of the
country is pro-choice.'' He says that he does not feel strongly
about legalizing casino gambling, and that the people should decide
the issue in a referendum.
</P>
<P>
   He makes it clear that the only issues that matter deeply to him
are education reform and fiscal policy. And that, he insists, is
enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in it to win,'' he said. ``People will tell you I can't
win, but they're wrong.''

A MORGAN STANLEY EXPERT'S TAKE ON THE MARKET TURMOIL

   (For release Sunday, Aug. 30)  
 (bl)  
 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Back in mid-January, the stock market faltered,
investors fretted, and Byron Wien, chief U.S. investment strategist
at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, stepped up to the plate. He told
clients that the Dow Jones industrial average, helped by declining
interest rates, could hit 9,000 during the first half of the year.
It did.
</P>
<P>
   But in early August, with the market down sharply from its July
17 high, some people wondered whether to prepare for the next leg
of the bull market or to sell. Wien advised the latter and those
who did are glad they did.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Wien shared his opinions about the market turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   Q. First, what has prompted all this?
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't think that Russia, in and of itself, is the factor
that has got everybody concerned. It's that Russia is the latest
development. What you have is a situation where Europe and the
United States were doing well and one by one the rest of the world
was getting into trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Is there a problem of further contagion?
</P>
<P>
   A. The people who are going to be hurt are the people who have
lent money to Russia or the people who have had investments there.
That's primarily the major German banks and some hedge funds and
they've already been hurt. I think the German banks can deal with
this and I don't think the hedge funds are a critical economic
factor.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How is this likely to play out in the United States markets?
</P>
<P>
   A. I think we began a topping process in June where the number
of stocks performing well was becoming increasingly narrow. Now
we're suffering the down side of this enormously favorable first
half that we had and my view is that we'll erase all of the gains
of this year.
</P>
<P>
   But I don't think we're in a serious bear market because the
economic fundamentals of the United States are still quite
favorable. The level of employment is still high. Interest rates
are low. Housing starts, durable goods orders are still strong. So
my belief is that we're going to suffer the worst correction that
we've had since October of 1990, but I don't think we're in a bear
market.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Corporate profits are starting to skid, though.
</P>
<P>
   A. One of the factors that could make me wrong is that profits
are coming through worse than I and others expected. But they are
still positive. In spite of all the things that have happened, the
year-over-year profits are still above a year ago. And I think they
will be better in the second half than they were in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Is the Dow catching up with the erosion that's been taking
place elsewhere?
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, I think that the rest of the market, beyond the top 100
stocks in the S&AMP;P 500, has been hitting a bear market for a while
now. More than 60 percent of the stocks on the New York Stock
Exchange were down more than 20 percent as of the end of last week.
Stocks like Coca-Cola are beginning to suffer along with the rest
of the market. Part of my idea of how this would unwind is that
some of these large-capitalization multinationals would suffer
along with the rest of the market and that would provide the final
flush-out that would end this phase of the decline.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Is there some flight to quality?
</P>
<P>
   A. There were some high-technology stocks like Microsoft, Dell
Computer and Cisco Systems that were certainly doing well.
Liquidity is playing a big factor in this market. One, if you're a
little uncertain about the market, you want to buy something,
you'll be able to sell if you change your mind. And, secondly, many
mutual funds now have grown to the size where they need
large-capitalization stocks to put certain amounts of money to
work.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How confident are you that shareholders will hang in there if
the market continues to sell off?
</P>
<P>
   A. I'm not confident at all about that. We've seen a few weeks
of poor markets and net redemptions. It's possible if we have
another bad week that August could turn out to be a net negative
month as far as withdrawals. The last time that happened was in the
fall of 1990. This won't be over until there are some mutual fund
redemptions.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Should investors look for stocks that have held up, or been
beaten up?
</P>
<P>
   A. If you look at the pattern of the market over the last decade
or so you'll see that out of every major correction new leadership
has emerged. For example, from 1988 to 1990, large-capitalization
stocks did extremely well. Then the market corrected as a result of
the Iraq invasion of Kuwait and, coming out of that, small- and
medium-capitalization stocks did well. Those are the ones I would
focus on when the final bottom is reached.
</P>
<P>
   Q. So, is your advice to sit tight or to lighten up?
</P>
<P>
   A. My advice has been to sell on the rallies because this is
going to get worse. But we're probably two-thirds of the way toward
the bottom. And next year is going to be a good year. So, if you
have stocks that you have long-term confidence in, I wouldn't sell
them at distressed prices here. On the other hand, if you have some
marginal holdings, where the fundamentals have changed, and you
don't have long-term conviction if the market does rally, I would
sell those.
</P>
<P>
   Q. And the bond market?
</P>
<P>
   A. You do have a flight to quality in the bonds. So you could
see long-term rates perhaps go to 5 percent but my view is that if
the economy stays strong and these are stabilized, and the Russian
situation doesn't infect the rest of Europe, long-term rates will
head higher next year.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Are there any particular stocks you would recommend?
</P>
<P>
   A. The carnage in the bank stocks has been extreme. The airlines
have suffered excessively. Those are the only two.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Where will the market end this year?
</P>
<P>
   A. My feeling is that the market will end the year plus or minus
5 percent of its starting point.

AMERICAN ORIENT EXPRESS: LUXURIOUS (BUT EXPENSIVE) RAIL
RELAXATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Aug. 30)  
 (duplication warning: also sent with `f' code)  
 (bl)  
 By TINA KELLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The American Orient Express luxury train, operating for less
than a year, already has its legends: the 94-year-old traveler who
has ridden it three times, the train buff who traveled across
Canada just so he could ride on an obscure 250-mile piece of track,
and the man who searches out the most expensive vacations possible.
</P>
<P>
   He probably felt right at home. An eight-night trek across
Canada or the United States in the Presidential Suite, which
includes a private shower, costs $7,890 a person, double occupancy.
Even the smallest compartments go for $4,990 on those runs.
</P>
<P>
   Operated by Oregon Rail Corp., the Express is the only fully
private passenger train running on the main rail lines in the
United States, said Henry Hillman Jr., the company's president and
owner.
</P>
<P>
   ``We consider it a cruise train, where you can live on board and
you don't have to unpack,'' he said. ``It's intimate, and it's an
opportunity to experience travel on a smaller space.''
</P>
<P>
   The train carries 15 cars built 40 to 50 years ago: seven
sleeping carriages, two dining cars, two club cars, two crew cars,
an observation car and a laundry. The cars were reconstructed,
their mechanical systems upgraded and their interiors refurbished
for about $1 million each.
</P>
<P>
   It's a graceful operation, paneled in Honduran mahogany. The
club cars feature painted ceilings and murals, plush carpeting and
faux marble walls, and the dining cars have inlaid portraits of
birds.
</P>
<P>
   Other elegant touches abound. A bottle of Mumm champagne chills
in each Presidential Suite and Godiva chocolates wait on pillows at
night. Rubrum lilies and long-stemmed red roses adorn the public
cars.
</P>
<P>
   In the dining car, the menu borrows from an earlier era of rail
travel, with dishes like venison chasseur from the Canadian Pacific
Railway and crab cakes with spicy citrus sauce a la B &AMP; O Lines.
</P>
<P>
   And the tours take travelers through some of the continent's
finest scenery, from the Canadian Rockies to the Deep South.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of a deluxe train for North America came from Swiss
investors more than a decade ago. They bought vintage rail cars
from museums, private collections and Amtrak and had them
refurbished, starting operations in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   That train, called the American European Express, stuck to a
Chicago-to-New York-to-Washington route as an alternative for
business travelers. But low ridership and an accident with a dump
truck caused the company to shut down soon after, Hillman said. For
four years, the train was used only for charter trips.
</P>
<P>
   The line came under its current ownership just last fall, when
Hillman said he and other ``venture capitalists willing to take a
flier on a new idea'' bought the train and its operations.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon Rail pays Amtrak and other rail lines for use of the
track, and contracts for the use of Amtrak and Canadian Northern
locomotives. The company aims to attract the richest 10 percent of
travelers _ people who might take cruises and who relish a relaxed
pace.
</P>
<P>
   The marketing of the train has also branched out to corporate
events, like a media tour for Subaru's introduction of its 1999
sport utility sedans. Other trip sponsors have been nonprofit
groups like the Smithsonian Institution and the National Trust for
Historic Preservation.
</P>
<P>
   The train travels from March through October, rotating among
eight scenic and historical tours around the continent, including a
``Jazz and Blues Express'' from Chicago to New Orleans, an
``American Heritage'' run from Montreal to Washington, a ``Rockies
and Yellowstone'' tour from Portland, Ore., and another national
parks trip, from Denver to Santa Fe, N.M.
</P>
<P>
   Nine routes are scheduled next year, and one more will be added
in 2000: a fall foliage tour of Vermont, New Hampshire and upstate
New York.
</P>
<P>
   Because of start-up and capital costs, the company is running at
a loss, but Hillman said he was confident that the train would
eventually be able to turn a profit, even at prices teetering
toward $1,000 a night. Indeed, he is assembling a second train of
vintage cars to run the routes.
</P>
<P>
   More than 5 million people in North America travel on cruise
ships each year, and 497,000 ride Amtrak's route down the Pacific
coast from Seattle to Los Angeles. So, company officials said, it
should not be too difficult to find 3,500 people to fill the
train's 35 trips next year.
</P>
<P>
   The Express carries up to 104 passengers, and, depending on the
route, has been running from 75 percent to 100 percent of capacity,
Hillman said. Several trips on the West Coast are already nearly
filled through 1999, he said.
</P>
<P>
   As passengers boarded earlier this month for the train's ``Great
Trans-Canada Rail Journey'' _ about 2,100 miles from Vancouver
through the Canadian Rockies to Montreal _ the crew stood at
attention in blue capes and white gloves. Each day, they provided a
meticulous itinerary, allowing passengers to pick out mountains,
ghost towns and waterfalls by watching for the numbered mile
markers along the track.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers could get out at some stops and explore the towns and
scenery. In Jasper, Alberta, for example, travelers could tour the
Athabasca Glacier off the Columbia Icefield.
</P>
<P>
   To break even, company officials said, most trips need to run at
about 75 percent of capacity but this particular run carried only
54 travelers. They ranged from mother-daughter pairs who had read
about the Express in Victoria magazine or seen it on a PBS program
called ``The Rockies by Rail,'' to corporate lawyers relaxing after
deals done, to couples celebrating anniversaries or birthdays.
</P>
<P>
   There were also train enthusiasts, known in the world of rolling
stock as ``foamers'' _ as in foaming at the mouth. These people
recognize locomotives by number and make comments like: ``So he
says you're an investor in his chooch.''
</P>
<P>
   One passenger, Frank Fairbanks of Pittsburgh, said he ranked
second among collectors of North American route miles _ at close to
250,000, not counting repeat trips. He once worked for American
Locomotive, an engine manufacturer, for a few years and loves
finding sections of track that he hasn't ridden before. On this
run, that meant 250 miles between Thunder Bay and Longlac,
Ontario. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another traveler, John Harmon of Lawrenceville, N.J., used to
take his wife, Elaine, on Friday-night dates to the Bethlehem, Pa.,
train station to watch the trains hook up. He worked for the New
York Central Railroad for five years as a computer programmer, and
has traveled from Berlin to Vladivostok behind a steam engine and
enjoyed ostrich for dinner on Rovos Rail, a luxury train that
operates in southern Africa. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Back at home, Harmon called the Canadian trek ``a truly
first-class, luxurious train-travel experience.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The food was outstanding,'' he said. ``I thought there were
very few things they could do to improve on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Company officials say train buffs do not make up a high
percentage of passengers. But Hillman thinks everyone is a train
buff at heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ask anybody if they like trains and train travel, and they all
love it,'' he said. ``But if you ask them when was the last time
they've done it, they don't recall at all.''

 &HT;    Spaniard ousts Kuchar
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCHESTER, N.Y. _ It's a scene that promises to be replayed
dozens of times over the next two decades or so.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, 18-year-old Spaniard Sergio Garcia on Friday ended Matt
Kuchar's dream of retaining his U.S. Amateur Championship, winning
2 and 1 their brilliant display of shotmaking at storied Oak Hill
Country Club, but it's only the beginning. When they both
eventually turn pro _ Garcia's gone after the '99 Masters _ there
are sure to be Ryder Cup matches played throughout the world to
regularly showcase their talents and similarly stir their thousands
of fans.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Friday's match, with 4,500 fans following in the fairway,
close enough to touch the tension, might always serve as the
reference point. It became match play at his finest, loaded with
great shots and sprinkled with some grand gamesmanship. Though
officially the featured match of the U.S. Amateur quarterfinals, it
never felt like anything other than a Sunday final. In the end,
Garcia, the British Amateur champion, put away the Georgia Tech
junior with a 8-foot birdie at the 16th hole to go 1-up _ prompting
a low, triple-pump of his right fist _ then clinched with a
two-putt par at the 17th.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ran into El Nino, I guess,'' Kuchar said, referring to
Garcia's nickname, which means ``the Boy'' in Spanish. ``It was
just a heck of a match. From the first hole to the 17th hole, it
was great shot after great shot. I'll probably watch it over and
over again just to see good golf. Hopefully, we can relive this at
a Ryder Cup. That would be exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was probably one of my best matches I've ever played,''
said the 5-foot-10, 150-pound Garcia, whose aggressive recovery
abilities have painted him as another Seve Ballesteros, ``and I
played with a great opponent, a great guy. I think we are very good
friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Garcia moves on to face Tom McKnight, a 43-year-old petroleum
distributor from Galax, Va., in a 9 a.m. semifinal match today,
trying to become the first player to win the British Amateur and
the U.S. Amateur in the same year since American Bob Dickson in
1967. Kuchar returns to relative college normalcy after a whirlwind
year that began with his out-of-nowhere Amateur win last year at
Cog Hill and continued through to magical performances in the
Masters and U.S. Open. His next tournament with any potential
national focus will be an appearance in the PGA Tour Buick
Challenge at Callaway Gardens Oct. 1-4.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very glad I came back,'' Kuchar said. ``I'm glad I decided
to stay an amateur even though I lost in the quarterfinals. ...
It's been a wild ride. I kind of enjoy the limelight, but every
once in a while it's nice to kick back and get away and be Matt
Kuchar, be a kid who's unknown and just walk around campus. Right
now I'm ready to go chill out for a while, be myself and go back to
school.''
</P>
<P>
   For Georgia Tech, the day became, in coach Bruce Heppler's
words, ``Black Friday.'' While in the back of his mind pondering an
all-Tech final of Kuchar vs. Bryce Molder, Heppler got a double
whammy. Molder lost 5 and 4 to long-hitting Hank Kuehne, 22, a
recovering alcoholic for the last three years.
</P>
<P>
   Searching for solace in the absence of a championship chance,
Molder decided, ``It's probably good I'm not going to have to go
through a lot of what Matt went through this year. I'm probably
going to play in at least three more of these.''

 &HT;    Jones carries `reckless' reputation
 &HT;    By Tom McCollister
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUDON, N.H. _ A reputation is a fragile thing. It can carry you
to the heights or leave you dangling somewhere in between.
</P>
<P>
   Buckshot Jones knows that well.
</P>
<P>
   His infamous feud with driver Randy Lajoie, which began in 1996,
has calmed. But those incidents _ the two ran into each other often
during Busch races _ has other drivers worried about Jones'
``reckless'' driving and Jones is on the defensive about every
collision.
</P>
<P>
   The low was last week at Bristol during a Busch race. Elton
Sawyer and Robert Pressley accused Jones of ``stupid driving,'' and
radio commentators blistered him for instigating a wreck on a
restart with 11 laps remaining.
</P>
<P>
   The accident began with the field racing out of turn four and
onto the front stretch. Jones was on the low side, a lap down, when
the race leaders began passing. Pressley, who was leading the race,
was in the high groove. Jones and Pressley collided, and the
ensuing melee damaged the cars of Ricky Craven, Ken Schrader, Tim
Fedewa, Mike McLaughlin, Sawyer, Tony Stewart and Kevin Grubb.
</P>
<P>
   When it was over, Pressley was looking at a 19th-place finish
instead of a victory, and Jones was standing his ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't cause that wreck,'' he said during an interview with
television commentators. ``I kept my line on the bottom of the
track. Pressley came down on me.''
</P>
<P>
   Replays backed that contention.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shocked me, what they said on radio and TV,'' Jones, who
finished eighth, said this week. ``Somebody pointed the finger at
me. I know I've got a reputation as being out of control at times,
and sometimes I push too hard. But I stayed on the bottom of the
track this time. I did not go up and hit him.''
</P>
<P>
   Television commentators Benny Parsons and Buddy Baker, who were
critical during the telecast, agreed. But they also said Jones
needs experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buckshot has a lot of ability, but like everyone he has a lot
to learn,'' said Parsons, the 1973 Winston Cup champion. ``At
Bristol, he didn't do anything wrong, but he put himself in
position to be hit. He shouldn't have been where he was.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker, winner of 19 Winston Cup races, believes Jones' run-in
with Lajoie built a reckless reputation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The booing he received last week at Bristol shouldn't have
happened,'' Baker said. ``If those people, and I don't mean just at
Bristol, would take time to look at the replays, they would see
things differently. He's talented and will never have to worry
about backing once he comes to Winston Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   Parsons believes Jones can be a better Winston Cup driver than
he has been on the Busch circuit. He showed it at Dover in May,
finishing eighth in the Circuit City car.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if he's one of the best Busch guys, he should be like
(Jeff) Gordon, above the fray, rather than part of it,'' Parsons
said. ``He needs to sit down and examine who he is. All the money
in the world won't bring him success. Look at (team owner) Gary
Bechtel. He has all the money in the world and can't win out here.
Bottom line? He has no future out here if he keeps wrecking.''

 &HT;    Boat hits 223, takes the pole for the Classic
 &HT;    By Kent Mitchell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Billy Boat might have been one of the few surprised
Friday when he blazed around Atlanta Motor Speedway at 224.145 and
captured the pole for Saturday night's Atlanta Classic 500.
</P>
<P>
   Boat and owner A.J. Foyt were concerned that the green No. 111
Conseco/A.J. Foyt Dallara/Aurora/Goodyear couldn't get around the
track five times because of electrical problems.
</P>
<P>
   Boat was one of six drivers who went 223 mph or faster in
qualifying.
</P>
<P>
   His Foyt teammate, Kenny Brack, looking for his third
consecutive win _ which would be the first in IRL history _ ran his
Foyt Power Racing team car 223.117 mph to qualify for sixth
position. Brack is No. 2 in points.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Ward was second at 223.973 and IRL points leader Scott
Sharp third at 223.837.
</P>
<P>
   The big surprise of the day was the dismal 213.543 _ unexplained
_ by 1997 IRL champion Tony Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   No one in the pits or stands _ some 18,000 _ would have bet that
Stewart would qualify 25th in a 28-car field.
</P>
<P>
   Boat drives the green car, supposedly an unlucky color in
racing, but Stewart has had buzzard luck the past couple of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   He was the IRL points leader and dropped to third after losing
15 points as part of a penalty to Team Menard for altering the
wings to lessen downforce and get more speed (he exceeded 228 mph
in July tests at AMS).
</P>
<P>
   Then, he was involved in the 22-car Busch-race pileup at
Bristol.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he's starting at the bottom of the heap today, trying to
catch a driver who still walks with a cane.
</P>
<P>
   Before the season began, Stewart announced he was switching to
NASCAR because there were no more challenges in the IRL. Today,
he'll have 24 challenges to take the lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guarantee a lot of people are going to see that (No. 1)
Menard going through the pack,'' said Boat.
</P>
<P>
   As for Boat's mild surprise about being on the pole: ``We never
got consistent charging,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So, as has been the case since his June crash in New Hampshire,
Boat did it the hard way.
</P>
<P>
   One thing that might help Stewart is the possiblity of help in
the draft. Boat said the draft will be a ``huge'' factor at
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than any other track,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said fans might see as many as five or six cars running
together.
</P>
<P>
   And at speeds never before seen on a Southern raceway.

 &HT;    Slick surface has drivers sliding into wall
 &HT;    By Tom McCollister
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUDON, N.H. _ Under most circumstances, Winston Cup practice is
as exciting as watching street cars run on the interstate.
</P>
<P>
   But there was nothing ordinary about Friday's 90-minute session
at New Hampshire International Speedway. A recently applied asphalt
conditioner became as treacherous as an ice skating rink.
</P>
<P>
   Five cars slid into the wall, four of them damaged serious
enough to cause teams to go to backup cars for qualifying. The cars
were: Jeff Burton's Ford, Dale Earnhardt's Monte Carlo, Ron
Fellows' Monte Carlo, Ernie Irvan's Pontiac, Ward Burton's Pontiac.
</P>
<P>
   Sterling Marlin spun his Monte Carlo but missed the wall. Dale
Jarrett spun, hurting the engine and forcing his crew to change
engines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't miss the groove, I didn't miss it at all,'' said Jeff
Burton. ``For whatever reason, there was oil on the track.''
</P>
<P>
   Marlin and Earnhardt wrecked in almost the same place, but
Earnhardt hit a little harder.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just going to be a survival Sunday,'' Marlin said. ``You
can't race hard because you're going to wreck. If they don't fix
it, they'll wreck 20 cars on restarts. I don't know how they'll fix
it. I guess if you got some dynamite you could fix it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sealer is on it. I guess the more laps run, the more
they'll burn off the sealer and maybe they'll get down to some
decent asphalt. They've either got to concrete it or find out the
mix they've got at some other tracks and put it on this track and
bank it so we can race.''
</P>
<P>
   NOTES: Gordon's crew chief Ray Evernham put aside his tools
Friday after Winston Cup qualifying to take a few laps in a Busch
North car prior to its qualifying.... The field of current Busch
Grand National drivers moving to Winston Cup in 1998 include
Buckshot Jones and Elton Sawyer. Sawyer likely will team up with
the Wood Brothers.

 &HT;    Gordon has time for CMT pole win
 &HT;    By Tom McCollister
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUDON, N.H. _ Timing is everything in Winston Cup qualifying,
and Jeff Gordon timed things just right Friday, winning his first
pole at New Hampshire International Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon drew the 15th qualifying slot for Sunday's Country Music
Television 300 and made the most of it with a speed of 129.033 mph.
That was safely ahead of those who tiptoed around the 1.05-mile
oval, still slick from an asphalt reconditioner applied earlier in
the day.
</P>
<P>
   ''We needed a little momentum coming out of that fifth place
finish at Bristol,'' Gordon said of his start last week. ''I'm
feeling a little bit better than I was last week when I was under
the weather. We were right there in the top 10 and top five in
practice all day, and it was a great run for us. I feel a little
sorry for those who went out first. It was a tough track for
them.''
</P>
<P>
   So tough, in fact, that three of the first four couldn't hold it
off the wall, with Dan Pardus, Ricky Rudd and Wally Dallenbach
taking the hardest hits. They qualified 46th, 34th and 37th
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   From there it was mostly clear sailing, with few exceptions.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was just a big disadvantage if you went out first or got an
early draw,'' Rudd said. ''I don't know what it is about New
Hampshire, but for some reason the guys that go later can be as
much as a second faster.''
</P>
<P>
   The luck of the draw kicked in with Mark Martin, the 11th car
out, giving confidence to those followed. For instance, Bobby
Labonte went out 40th and qualified second; Ken Schrader was 35th
to go and was third fastest; Kenny Wallace was last, but starts
fourth Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our goal was to make the top 10,'' Martin said. ''This was a
real poor situation with the draw. This track bleeds some kind of
grease whenever you don't run on it, and an early draw really hurts
you. You feel for those who went out early.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those facing second round qualifying today are Johnny
Benson, 39th, Rich Bickle (40th), Dave Marcis (41st), Buckshot
Jones (43rd), Michael Waltrip (44th) and Ron Fellows (45th).
Darrell Waltrip is 42nd, but has a past champion's provisional to
fall back on.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a backup car these guys have used at tracks like
Martinsville,'' said Fellows, who wrecked the same car twice during
practice. ''We've got some work to do. I guess the backup car club
has grown a lot today, and it looks like we're in good company.''

RUSSIA'S CRISIS REVEALS THE UGLY SIDE OF GLOBALIZATION

 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``From the standpoint of the United States economy, Russia does
not matter.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the line coming from American stock market optimists
until late last week. Their research reports and market comments
painted a benign picture of Russian turmoil, at least as it
concerned Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Of all U.S. exports, the reasoning went, less than 1 percent
were to Russia. The Russian economy was no larger than that of the
Netherlands. Few people invested their money there and those who
did knew they faced high risks.
</P>
<P>
   Investors ignored that logic and panicked anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's financial and political crisis, however removed from
the day-to-day business of most U.S. companies and from the
portfolios of most investors, prompted the largest one-day selloff
of stocks so far this year, sending the Dow Jones industrial
average down 357.36 points, or 4.19 percent, on Thursday. A further
loss of 114.31 points in a volatile session Friday left the Dow at
8,051.68, to close the week down 13.8 percent from its peak in
July. Most other stock markets also fell, and a flight of capital
to the safety of Treasury bonds drove the yield on the benchmark
30-year bond down to just 5.34 percent.
</P>
<P>
   If the current correction in stock prices turns into a
full-scale bear market, meaning a retreat of more than 15 percent
in the Dow, historians will almost certainly see Russia as the
trigger.
</P>
<P>
   The reason, to use the buzzword of the mid-1990s, is
globalization: the ugly version.
</P>
<P>
   The good version was peddled right up until the current crisis
erupted. It held that capitalism was spreading through the places
where socialism once reigned. Tapping new markets and billions of
new consumers, multinationals had already begun to earn big money
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The ugly version is of more recent vintage. It goes like this:
Currency crises can zip from one changing economy to the next,
spreading deflation around the world and leaving recessions in
their wake. No one, not the United States or the International
Monetary Fund, has the power, or perhaps the will, to do much about
it.
</P>
<P>
   From that perspective, Russia is the latest to succumb to a
contagion that first broke out in Thailand in July 1997 and shows
no sign of slowing its global march. South Korea has more economic
heft. Thailand and Malaysia have more foreign investment. But
Russia was a vital experiment in capitalism that until very
recently was thought to be too important, politically and
militarily, to fail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any one of these countries in isolation is not big potatoes in
the world economy,'' said Jeffrey Garten, dean of the Yale School
of Management, ``but they tell a story about the downside of
globalization.''
</P>
<P>
   When he served in the Commerce Department during the first
Clinton administration, Garten was a leading proponent of America's
global push. Today, he sees the dark side of the trend. ``Nobody
ever said that globalization was just a great thing, that it only
means economic progress for everyone,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's fall makes clear that capitalism _ floating currencies,
open borders and free markets _ cannot exist without institutions
to support it, Garten said. The United States has a Federal Reserve
Board to act as a backstop in a bank crisis. The Securities and
Exchange Commission serves as a cop for the stock market. Bank
deposits are federally insured. Global capitalism has no such
bulwarks.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one reason we had a global depression in the 1930s,''
Garten said. ``No one took responsibility. We have been fooling
ourselves that the IMF would act as a lender of last resort. They
have not. They failed, in Asia and now in Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia's decline also shows the power of global price trends.
Some see Russia as having aggravated an already troubling downward
spiral of prices, or deflation, that is sweeping the world through
ever-cheaper manufactured goods.
</P>
<P>
   Prices for these goods began to tumble in Asia in the mid-1990s.
Many countries in that region now have full-scale deflation in
consumer prices, a phenomenon not seen on such a scale since the
Depression. With the devaluation of the ruble, prices of Russian
exports like oil and metals, which were already sagging, are likely
to slump further.
</P>
<P>
   Falling prices on a broad scale can be insidious because
companies earn steadily less for the products they make and because
consumers tend to wait before they buy. But while most economists
recognize the evil of deflation, little is being done to stop the
spread, said Chen Zhao, a managing editor of Bank Credit Analyst, a
research and publishing concern in Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, real interest rates, which take inflation into account,
are at record highs in many countries, as governments and central
banks try to defend their currencies against speculators. Shortly
after Russia devalued the ruble, for example, Canada and Mexico
raised rates to defend their currencies. High real rates slow
economic growth and put fresh downward pressure on prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia is part of the deflation problem,'' Chen said. ``We
don't think there are any major forces that can put a stop to it.''
He suggests that the U.S. Federal Reserve should lower interest
rates to reduce the relative appeal of the dollar. But he sees few
signs that the Fed is prepared to do so unless domestic economic
fundamentals take a turn for the worse. ``The U.S. does not
comprehend the risk,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So far, Russia's internal problems have had only a marginal
effect on earnings of companies in the United States. Republic New
York, BankAmerica and Lehman Brothers are three financial
institutions that have already acknowledged some Russia-related
losses. Several high-risk hedge funds took serious hits and others
may follow. Steel companies, paper producers, chemical producers
and others dependent on commodity prices are also made vulnerable
by Russian deflation.
</P>
<P>
   But if the direct losses are relatively minor, the indirect
cost, including the toll on investor psychology, is immeasurably
large. Investors have already begun to treat ``global'' as a bad
word.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, many of the largest companies in the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500-stock index advertised their world ties, and it was not
just hype. Over the last decade, the foreign share of sales of S&AMP;P
500 companies have risen to 34 percent from 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Of Exxon's total sales, 88 percent are foreign, according to
IBES International; Coca-Cola sells two-thirds of its soft drinks
abroad. Motorola is 60 percent foreign. Intel and Dow Chemical both
sell more than half of their goods overseas. Because of the turmoil
in emerging markets and the strong dollar, which reduces the dollar
value of foreign sales, IBES now projects that all of those
companies' earnings will fall this year. Merrill Lynch downgraded
Coca-Cola shares last week, citing emerging-markets woes.
</P>
<P>
   After faring relatively well in the summer selloff, shares of
large, internationally oriented companies are getting slaughtered.
``Globalization is starting to work against us,'' said Byron Wien,
chief U.S. investment strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.
``The international luster is tarnished.''
</P>
<P>
   James Grant, editor of Grant's Interest Rate Observer and a
longtime bear, said Russia's woes and the poor short-term outlook
for the global economy left Wall Street bulls with little ground to
stand on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Globalization means the knee bone is connected to the thigh
bone,'' Grant said. ``When there were these great developments
abroad, it was a whole new world of opportunity. It could explain
some extraordinary valuations of stocks. Then when it's not
working, Wall Street decides that the rest of the world doesn't
count for much.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea that the U.S. market alone can justify stock prices
that were once predicated on world expansion is an exercise in
wishful thinking, Grant said. ``You could call it rank cynicism or
hopeless optimism,'' he added. ``I don't think anyone will believe
it.''

TOMS RIVER AIMING FOR FESTIVE FINAL

<TEXT>
<P>
   WILLIAMSPORT, Pa. _ Mike Gaynor, the manager of Toms River East,
was standing outside Howard J. Lamade Stadium on Friday afternoon
with a look of morning-after exhaustion from the late-night
delirium of winning the U.S. championship Thursday night. But the
time for celebration was over, as his team was one day away from
taking on Kashima, Japan, in the Little League World Series
championship game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The joke all month long has been that my wins are up, but my
sales are down,'' said Gaynor, who owns a chain of athletic
footwear stores called Feet First. ``It's a busy time of year and
I'm usually the one doing most of the buying, but I haven't been
there all month long.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the 12-year-olds from Toms River East, they could not be
bothered with the prospect of being on the biggest Little League
stage Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   After facing the news media early Friday, the bleary-eyed
players spent the rest of the day taking in the Little League
Jamboree, a daylong carnival that included a hitting contest and an
all-star game made up of the six other teams that played here.
Coming off the high of Thursday night's 5-2 victory over
Greenville, N.C., the Toms River players just wanted to have a last
bit of fun during this once-in-a-lifetime experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just the baseball players,'' outfielder Chris Cardone
said jokingly as he and third baseman Gabe Gardner loitered around
the press box after the hitting contest, toying with camera
equipment and acting as if they did not have a care in the world.
</P>
<P>
   If Saturday afternoon's nationally televised game is anything
like the first four victories Toms River has picked up here in
Williamsport, Toms River will rely on its pitching to keep the game
close and then wait for timely hits. Those hits have been coming
from the likes of Gardner, first baseman Scott Fisher, who pitched
a complete game in Thursday night's victory, and shortstop Todd
Frazier, who has quickly become a fan favorite here with his
outgoing personality and clutch hitting. His two-run home run in
the sixth and final inning that broke open Thursday night's game
against Greenville was only the latest chapter in Frazier's
terrific performance. Frazier seems to demand the spotlight because
he knows he will come through.
</P>
<P>
   Casey Gaynor, the manager's son, will start Saturday's game for
Toms River. He pitched the first five innings of Sunday's 11-inning
marathon against Jenison, Mich., allowing eight runs, before coming
back Tuesday with a complete-game 5-3 victory over Greenville in
the preliminary round.
</P>
<P>
   He will face a Kashima lineup that has been on and off against
the international competition. In becoming the first Japanese team
to make the championship game since 1976, it finished preliminary
round play with a 2-1 record. Kashima struggled mightily against
Langley, Canada, in Thursday's international championship game
before pulling out a 3-2 eight-inning victory. Kashima will make
history when center fielder Sayaka Tsushima becomes the first girl
to play in a championship game.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been some difficulty showing Japan how well we're
playing because of the time difference,'' Kashima Manager Atsushi
Okawa said. ``But the town of Kashima is still very excited and
very much into it.''
</P>
<P>
   The pool play format was instituted in 1992 in order to ensure
that all eight teams who participate in the Little League World
Series get at least three games. Breaking the pools into
international and U.S. groups was done to avoid all-international
finals, as was the case in 1985 when South Korea beat Mexico, 7-1.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of Saturday's result, Toms River East will leave
Williamsport Sunday morning with a police escort, arriving in Toms
River in the early afternoon. The team has also been scheduled to
appear on ``The Rosie O'Donnell Show'' on Wednesday, and later will
have lunch at the All-Star Cafe in New York City's Times Square.
The whirlwind of activity will be capped with a parade in Toms
River a week from Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bit much, overwhelming,'' Mike Gaynor said. ``But hey,
it's a once-in-a-lifetime experience.''
</P>
<P>
   He paused for a second, remembering he had coached the 1995 Toms
River team to Williamsport, and said, smiling, ``Or in my case,
twice-in-a-lifetime.''

CLINTON: ONE MUST FORGIVE TO BE FORGIVEN 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAK BLUFFS, Mass. _ In a sweltering church echoing with kind
words toward him, a clearly moved President Clinton sought a
measure of atonement Friday as he said one must forgive in order to
seek forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, stopping short of an apology for the Monica Lewinsky
scandal, made his first remarks on the topic since a defiant
address to the nation Aug. 17, the day before coming here to
Martha's Vineyard for vacation.
</P>
<P>
   His remarks, handwritten on the back of the original draft
written by aides, caught even his staff by surprise. White House
aides for nearly two weeks have pondered a way to help Clinton save
his presidency since he conceded an ``improper relationship'' with
the former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   But Friday afternoon, the president stood on familiar territory,
in a pulpit at Union Chapel here, where 300 people gathered to
commemorate the 35th anniversary of the March on Washington and
Martin Luther King's ``I have a dream'' speech. The president spoke
about the lessons he learned from the civil rights movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of you know, I'm having to become quite an expert in this
business of asking for forgiveness,'' he said as the racially
diverse audience repeatedly applauded him. ``It gets a little
easier the more you do it. And if you have a family, an
administration, a Congress and a whole country to ask you, you're
going to get a lot of practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I have to tell you that in these last days, it has come
home to me again, something I first learned as president, but it
wasn't burned in my bones, and that is that in order to get it, you
have to be willing to give it,'' he said as the crowd again
applauded.
</P>
<P>
   ``And all of us _ the anger, the resentment, the bitterness, the
desire for recrimination against people you believe have wronged
you, they harden the heart and deaden the spirit and lead to
self-inflicted wounds. And so it is important that we are able to
forgive those we believe have wronged us, even as we ask for
forgiveness from people we have wronged,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's remarks perhaps were aimed at independent counsel
Kenneth Starr, whose four-year investigation into the president
turned in January to allegations of an affair with the former White
House intern.
</P>
<P>
   The president, who addressed the nation after testifying before
Starr's grand jury, acknowledged deceiving the nation and his wife
about Lewinsky for seven months, but he then attacked Starr and
called for the matter to be left alone.
</P>
<P>
   The speech angered Republicans and upset Democrats who had hoped
for the president to apologize and appear contrite. Calls for
Clinton to resign have increased even as opinion polls indicate the
public wants him to stay in office.
</P>
<P>
   But still there was no apology, and aides refused to provide any
interpretation of the president's remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Sosnik, a presidential adviser traveling with the
president, said Clinton personally wrote his speech and did not
tell aides its contents. ``That's the way he felt when he wrote
it,'' Sosnik said.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Toiv, the White House spokesman, said, ``I don't think
we're going to be in the interpretation business. The words speak
for themselves. He got up today and decide that's want he wanted to
say.''
</P>
<P>
   Since admitting he deceived his wife and Americans about an
affair with Lewinsky, the president has secluded himself in a
waterfront estate near here with first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton
and daughter Chelsea. But his vacation from Washington, both
personal and political, comes to a close on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   What exactly happened in that house for nearly two weeks isn't
known, but White House spokesmen repeatedly said the family was
working on ``healing'' the breach in the family caused by Clinton's
affair. There has been no golf, Clinton's usual form of relaxation.
And, his break was interrupted by his order for military strikes
against terrorist bases last week.
</P>
<P>
   Temporarily, the president can take some refuge in an
international crisis as he leaves Monday for Russia, Ireland and
Northern Ireland before returning on Labor Day weekend.
</P>
<P>
   But the president will return to Washington to face an uncertain
political future and no clear strategy other than trying to change
the focus.
</P>
<P>
   The president did fly to nearby Worcester on Thursday where he
was greeted by large and enthusiastic crowds as he spoke about
school violence. And, the event at Union Chapel originally was
intended to underscore Clinton's policies.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton enters the unknown as both the White House and
Congress await Starr's report into the relationship with Lewinsky
and the possible abuse of power in covering up the affair.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Clinton's advisers seem divided on what the
president's next steps should be in dealing with American public
opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sense I have is that public opinion isn't settled and they
don't know quite how to reinforce it and he's going to give a
speech to put a policy face back on the administration,'' said
Bruce Buchanan, a presidential expert at the University of Texas at
Austin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the question of what next seems very much up in the
air,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One Democratic congressional aide speculated that Clinton's
fellow Democrats will take a ``wait and see'' attitude until
Starr's report arrives at the House of Representatives. Until then,
few are willing to offer any defense of the president.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in Union Chapel, the defense was long and loud and
clearly moved Clinton, who mouthed the words ``thank you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the president has a lot of fair-weather friends,'' said
Charles Ogletree Jr., a Harvard University law professor who hosted
the celebration at Union Chapel. ``This is not a fair-weather
crowd.''
</P>

<P>
   Spending more for auto insurance than on car payments? You're
not alone.
</P>
<P>
   Although heightened competition, a fraud crackdown and
double-digit returns on insurance companies' investment portfolios
have kept premiums in check for the last few years, the high cost
of auto insurance remains a hot political issue in traffic-choked
states from New Jersey to California.
</P>
<P>
   And an unusual coalition of would-be reformers, urban
officeholders and partisan Republicans is trying to channel that
simmering discontent into the most far-reaching changes in auto
coverage in a quarter-century.
</P>
<P>
   The advocates' motto is ``auto choice,'' which stands for a set
of legal changes based on the idea of cutting premiums by limiting
the right to sue for damages. Republican congressional leaders,
eager to seize an issue that touches a populist chord, have vowed
to bring to the floor in both houses before the November elections
a bill that would require states to adopt the auto-choice approach.
</P>
<P>
   Passage of such legislation _ bitterly opposed by trial lawyers
and some consumer groups _ would seem unlikely this fall. But
hardly anything about the plan, which supporters say would save
drivers some $40 billion annually, is following the conventional
script.
</P>
<P>
   For example, insurance companies are divided on auto choice,
even though they might be expected to stand behind any proposal
that clipped the wings of their nemesis, the trial bar. Support for
the plan, meanwhile, has come from such disparate political players
as the conservative U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the pragmatic
mayor of Denver, Wellington Webb.
</P>
<P>
   The roots of auto choice are found in the wreckage of the last
great push for change in auto insurance: the no-fault movement of
the early 1970s. In jurisdictions that adopted no-fault coverage _
13 states, including New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, plus
Puerto Rico _ an accident victim's own insurance company pays
claims against medical bills and lost wages (called economic
losses) up to the policy limits. That contrasts with the ``pure
tort'' arrangement in most other states, in which the injured must
collect from those they say were at fault _ typically, the other
driver's insurance company.
</P>
<P>
   When states first adopted no-fault plans, it was widely assumed
that lawsuits would become rare and that the chunk of insurance
premium dollars swallowed by litigation costs would shrink to
almost nothing. In fact, legislation in almost every no-fault state
left wide loopholes that permitted lawsuits for a range of
non-economic losses.
</P>
<P>
   State no-fault laws routinely make exceptions for deliberately
caused injuries, injuries caused by drunken drivers and injuries
resulting in death. Many states also permit suits for ``loss of
bodily function,'' ``serious disfigurement'' or ``temporary
disability'' _ all examples of injuries serious enough to meet a
legal standard, the so-called verbal threshold for litigation.
Still others set a dollar threshold; when injuries result in
medical bills exceeding some minimum, claims can be brought for
pain and suffering.
</P>
<P>
   These dollar thresholds have had a particularly perverse effect,
according to Michael Horowitz, a senior fellow at the Hudson
Institute, a conservative research group in Washington, who
champions auto choice: They encourage the injured to spend extra on
physicians and chiropractors to meet the legal minimums _ or even
to enlist them in fraud. ``It's become a rule of thumb that
insurers settle claims for three times the medical costs,''
Horowitz said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Worse, perhaps, the tort system rarely compensates those who
most deserve to be compensated. In a 1991 study of thousands of
accidents in pure tort states, the Rand Institute for Civil Justice
estimated that injury victims with economic losses exceeding
$100,000 received just 9 cents on the dollar in compensation, on
average.
</P>
<P>
   And across the spectrum of tort and no-fault states, a
remarkable amount of money is spent just to keep the wheels of
justice in motion. According to a study this year by the Joint
Economic Committee of Congress, attorney fees absorbed 28 percent
of every premium dollar paid for bodily injury coverage in 1996.
Fraudulent claims chewed up an additional 13 percent. And agents'
commissions and other overhead expenses devoured 25 percent. That
left just 34 percent of premiums for compensating accident victims.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, no-fault seems to work best in minimizing lawsuits in
states that set the toughest thresholds for determining whether an
accident victim can go to court _ a requirement, for example, that
an accident result in ``permanent injury or disability.''
</P>
<P>
   But even in Michigan, widely regarded as the toughest no-fault
state, coverage for bodily injuries remains relatively expensive,
because the state mandates that every policy provide unlimited
coverage of economic losses.
</P>
<P>
   Auto choice aims to accomplish the initial goal of no-fault _
lower premiums and fewer lawsuits _ by putting a price on the right
to sue.
</P>
<P>
   Drivers choosing the basic coverage would receive virtually
bulletproof no-fault: They would be permitted to sue for pain and
suffering only when contending that the injury was intentional or
that the other driver was drunk. (They could also sue in the
relatively uncommon circumstance in which tangible economic losses
exceeded their ``personal injury protection'' coverage.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, drivers who wanted the option to sue for pain
and suffering could retain it _ but would pay an additional
premium.
</P>
<P>
   The price difference would be substantial. According to Stephen
Carroll and Allan Abrahamse, researchers at Rand, the cost of
providing bodily injury insurance would be 45 percent less, on
average, for drivers who opted for basic coverage. And since
personal injury protection represents a bit more than half the cost
of auto insurance, the cost of a basic policy under the choice
system would fall a bit less than 25 percent _ an average of $184
for each car each year, by the Rand calculations.
</P>
<P>
   But there would be new complications. When a driver with full
tort coverage was injured by another with a full tort plan, they
would be free, of course, to duke it out in court. And when two
drivers with basic coverage were in an accident, there presumably
would be no suit. But when a driver with tort coverage was hit by a
driver with basic coverage, the injured party would have to sue his
own insurance company for pain and suffering. That situation _
which could occur often _ ``is terribly complicated,'' said Bob
Pike, general counsel for Allstate, one of the nation's biggest
auto insurers, which opposes auto choice.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey O'Connell, a law professor at the University of Virginia
and a proponent of auto choice, says the interaction between tort
and basic drivers had a Rube Goldberg feel to it. But, he noted,
``it's no worse than the problem with uninsured-motorist coverage,
where injured parties must collect from their own insurance
company.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Criticism of auto choice comes in many stripes. Some is
financially motivated, at least in part. In a membership
recruitment letter last year, the Association of Trial Lawyers of
America called auto choice ``an assault on our livelihood.''
</P>
<P>
   Other opposition comes from consumer groups that view any limit
on the right to sue as a dangerous constraint on the little guy.
Without much thought, the vast majority of drivers would give up
their rights in return for premium savings, said Joan Claybrook,
president of Public Citizen, the consumer advocacy group founded by
Ralph Nader.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, she argued, ``drivers who cause grievous harm ought to
pay.''
</P>
<P>
   Many insurance executives see the whole notion of federal
intervention as the camel's nose under the tent. ``How we
compensate injury victims should be addressed at the state level,''
said Pike of Allstate.
</P>
<P>
   George Priest, a law professor at Yale University, generally
sympathizes with initiatives to minimize the cost of settling legal
disputes. But he wonders about the justice of auto choice. No-fault
plans socialize the cost of accidents, he said, and barriers to
suits for pain and suffering reduce the chance of collecting from
wrongdoers. Put those together, and auto choice reduces the odds
that dangerous drivers will be forced off the road by higher
premiums. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of auto choice have an answer to each of the
objections. To begin with, the state's rights issue is a red
herring, argued O'Connell of the University of Virginia. Under the
measure pending in Congress, state legislatures would have the
discretion to reject auto choice, while state regulators would have
the authority to block its implementation if insurers could not
guarantee minimum levels of savings for insured drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the states' broad discretion to reject or modify auto
choice _ included in the bill in order to attract conservatives'
votes _ worries some advocates, who remember the process that
peppered no-fault insurance with the loopholes that largely
nullified its impact.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters also scoff at the idea that auto choice would give a
free ride to dangerous drivers. While any no-fault system reduces
deterrence of bad driving, Horowitz argued that the impact would be
very modest. ``Insurers would still have plenty of reason to charge
higher rates to bad drivers,'' he said, because they are more
likely to injure themselves. Besides, he added, drivers who cause
injuries could still be sued for economic losses that exceeded the
injured person's own coverage. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   However consumers come down on these issues, the potential
savings in premiums will win them over, proponents of auto choice
say.
</P>
<P>
   They figure that those 25 percent savings in premiums for basic
coverage would prove attractive across the board. And the potential
savings for two influential groups are even more striking.
</P>
<P>
   Premiums for commercial vehicles would fall by about 28 percent,
according to the Joint Economic Committee. Corporations, which now
face a disproportionate share of suits for pain and suffering,
would enjoy bigger-than-average savings as the number of suits
declined; injuries to their own drivers, moreover, are already
covered by workmen's compensation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's real simple,'' said Larry Kraus, a spokesman for the
Chamber of Commerce. ``Our three million members would save $8
billion annually.''
</P>
<P>
   City dwellers are also in a position to reap exceptional savings
from restrictions on suits, because urban accident victims are
exceptionally litigious. In Washington, D.C., for instance, auto
accident rates fell 22 percent between 1985 and 1995, but the
number of lawsuits over auto accidents rose 137 percent, according
to the Joint Economic Committee. In 1994, the committee found,
people involved in auto accidents in Los Angeles were 2.2 times as
likely to claim they were injured as people in the rest of the
state. In Philadelphia, the multiple was 3.5; in New York City,
2.7; in Newark, 2.4. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By no coincidence, a 1991 survey by Robert Klein, then the
director of research for the National Association of Insurance
Commissioners, showed that the average liability premium was 32
percent higher for drivers in large cities than in other parts of
the same states. Hence the support for the overhaul proposals from
some big-city politicians. ``I favor auto choice for one reason,''
said Webb, the Denver mayor. ``My constituents would be a lot
better off.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The numbers help explain the eclectic band of supporters drawn
to auto choice. In the Senate, they include Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.,
Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., and Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn.
Other supporters are Rep. James Moran of Virginia, a centrist
suburban Democrat; Republican Governors Christie Whitman of New
Jersey and John Engler of Michigan; Mayor Rudolph Guiliani of New
York City, and past presidential candidates like Michael Dukakis
and Steve Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   To deepen this coalition, Republican congressional leaders say
they intend to cast their insurance proposals in populist terms,
just in time for the November election. ``Auto choice is for the
moms and dads who sit at the kitchen table every month with the
family checkbook trying to balance the family needs with the family
budget,'' said House Majority Leader Dick Armey.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the biggest auto insurers, USAA and State Farm, support
auto choice, on the grounds that it would cut the portion of
premium dollars burned up by fraud and litigation. But other major
insurance companies are either opposed or are watching from the
sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Trial lawyers are investing heavily in the defeat of auto
choice. ``We're focusing like a laser beam on this issue,'' said
Richard Hailey, the past president of the trial lawyers
association.
</P>
<P>
   Hopes for passage rest on a combination of pressure from the
Congressional leadership to keep Republicans in line and
small-business support drummed up by the Chamber of Commerce. But
swing votes will have to come from Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   And legislators might very well feel pressure from their
constituents on the topic. While auto insurance is not on voters'
minds in much of middle America, it is a volatile issue in densely
populated parts of the East and West Coasts. High premiums almost
toppled Whitman last year, when her Democratic opponent, Jim
McGreevey, made the cost of auto insurance a centerpiece of his
campaign. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Will Washington politicians remember this episode? That depends
on how much consumers care about the issue. ``Auto choice would
give city residents a much needed break on insurance,'' said Moran
of Virginia. ``The big question is whether they'll get the message
and explain their feelings to Congress.''

HARVARD TO OFFER COMPUTERIZED RECORD OF SLAVE TRADE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TATSHA ROBERTSON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After four years of research, Harvard University is prepared to
release the most comprehensive computerized record of the
Trans-Atlantic slave trade, allowing teachers, scholars, and
ordinary Americans unprecedented information on 27,233 slave trips
to the New World, or 70 percent of all voyages.
</P>
<P>
   The database, published this fall on a $195 CD-ROM, will
challenge popular perceptions about the inaccessibility of
information on slave roots. It will make known more information
about slave migration prior to 1820 than the European migrant flow
during that same time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point is that slaves were commodities, owned by somebody,
and the records are therefore better than for most Europeans that
came over during the earlier period,'' said David Eltis, a fellow
at Harvard University's W.E B. Du Bois Institute of Afro-American
Research.
</P>
<P>
   The database, which tracks more than 300 years of slave trading
from 1527 to 1866, doesn't provide names of slaves. But it does
contain the names of ship captains, vessels, ship owners, mortality
rates of the slaves, their ages and genders, as well as indicators
of slave rebellions, said Frank Smith, a history editor at
Cambridge Univerity Press, publisher of the CD-ROM.
</P>
<P>
   The names of the enslaved ``were never part of any records of
the past,'' said Smith. ``If you were captured they didn't care
about the names of the slaves; it's the brutal truth.''
</P>
<P>
   But seeking genealogical information, for example, can
determine, with the click of a mouse, where in Africa each voyage
originated and its specific destinations in the Americas.
</P>
<P>
   This alone, said Stephen Behrendt a Havard fellow who worked
with Eltis on the project, could change the way people view the
continent of Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``Africa has just as many differences as Europe, so you want
people to start looking at who the various people are that live in
Africa ... like someone from Gambia and Senegal,'' Behrendt said.
</P>
<P>
   The project gathered information about slave ship voyages from
archives all over the world and knitted it all together. So, now,
for the first time, large amounts of information are placed in one
spot, allowing historians to study patterns that may show how
Africa, or at least the African slave trade, has influenced the
world.
</P>
<P>
   The database, Eltis said, provides evidence of some provocative
trends. For instance, data suggest that slave traders went out of
their way to capture Africans known for their rice cultivation,
eventually bringing that skill to America.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he said, route patterns show that Europeans
avoided certain African coastal areas known for rebellious tribes.
</P>
<P>
   Eltis, a history professor at Queens College in Canada in
addition to his Harvard appointment, said he hopes the data will
help scholars better understand how African skills and traditions
took root in the New World.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like to think that certain institutions came from Europe _
like the political and judicial systems _ but what this dataset
does is allow people interested in Afro-America culture to see the
influences of the African culture,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The CD-ROM will be unveiled before more than 400 international
historians, scholars, and journalists at a conference called
``Trans-Atlantic Slaving and the African Diaspora: Using the W.E.B.
Du Bois Dataset of Slaving Voyages,'' from September 11-13 at the
College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Historians believe 11 million people were taken from Africa as
slaves to the Americas, Caribbean islands, and Europe _ with up to
600,000 of them shipped to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the data in this project was compiled over the past four
years by Eltis and Behrendt, assisted by two other researchers,
David Richardson and Herbert Klein, who are not associated with
Harvard. But the gathering of information about slave ship voyages
began about 25 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The effort began when computers became widely available, and
scholars around the world could input archival information on the
slave trade, said Behrendt.
</P>
<P>
   By the late 1980s, 11,000 individual voyages were included in
databases. Behrendt and Eltis, who met while working independently
on projects that focused on the British slave trade, compiled
information on an additional 16,000 voyages. They finished
compiling information at Harvard last year and began preparing it
for publication.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a starting point, not a finishing point,'' said Eltis.
`` There is a lot of information out there.''

SEARCH IN NEW JERSEY FOR MISSING WIDOW ENDS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., N.J., N.Y., Utah)  (js) 
 By ROBERT D. McFADDEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   The police searched an overgrown field on the outskirts of
Jersey City, N.J., for a second day Friday, but abandoned the
effort late in the day after failing to find Irene Silverman, the
82-year-old New York City widow who vanished eight weeks ago and is
believed to have been killed in a swindlers' scheme to get her town
house and fortune.
</P>
<P>
   The search, prompted by information from a Florida man who had
worked for the mother and son who are the prime suspects in the
disappearance, was another setback in a two-month investigation
that began with intriguing circumstantial and documentary clues but
has produced no forensic evidence and only fruitless searches for a
body.
</P>
<P>
   Marilyn Mode, a spokeswoman for the New York City Police
Department said Friday that the search had ended. ``It concluded at
5:10 p.m. with no plans to return tomorrow, having turned up
nothing of note,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   For 10 hours on Thursday and more than eight hours Friday, a
score of police officers using lawn mowers, machetes and shovels
whacked through weeds and dense foliage on a tract larger than a
football field, just north of St. Peter's Cemetery and west of
Highway 1-9, where the western fringe of Jersey City gives way to
the tall grass and scrub of the Meadowlands.
</P>
<P>
   It was a plausible site to search for a body: an isolated field
distant from any homes or commercial areas.
</P>
<P>
   The search was undertaken on information provided by Jose
Antonio Alvarez, 24, of Belle Glade, Fla., who was employed as a
handyman last spring by Sante Kimes, 63, and her son, Kenneth Kimes
Jr., 23, the suspects in the disappearance of Mrs. Silverman, who
was last seen on July 5 at her home in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Alvarez accompanied the Kimeses to New York in June, but
returned to Florida before Mrs. Silverman vanished and is not a
suspect, the police said. The police said he told investigators
that Kenneth Kimes, in a drive past the Jersey City field last
June, had remarked that it would be a good place to get rid of
something.
</P>
<P>
   On the night of the widow's disappearance, the Kimeses, who had
rented a room in her mansion, were arrested in Manhattan on an
unrelated Utah warrant on a bad-check charge. The police said the
two were holding a deed transferring Mrs. Silverman's town house to
them for $390,000, a tenth of its value, and had a passport and
financial papers belonging to Mrs. Silverman.
</P>
<P>
   But later searches in the metropolitan area have failed to find
a body. While the Kimeses have not been charged in her
disappearance, investigators say they believe the widow was killed
in a plot for her mansion and money.
</P>
<P>
   The mother and son are being held in New York on the Utah
warrant and on a New York indictment charging them with credit-card
fraud.
</P>
<P>
   The Kimeses' lawyers have repeatedly denied the allegations.

AIR TRAVELERS TAKE STRIKE POSSIBILITY IN STRIDE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.D., Minn., Tenn., Pa.)  (lb) 
 By EDWIN McDOWELL

<P>
   Many passengers of Northwest Airlines were worried and confused
Friday ahead of the midnight strike deadline set by the airline's
pilots.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest had canceled 170 of its 1,700 flights Friday, and some
passengers were forced to seek other flights. Still, travelers
reacted stoically to the problems they might face.
</P>
<P>
   ``Between Hurricane Bonnie and the threat of a Northwest strike,
I figure I'm playing double jeopardy,'' said Tammy Wangler of
Fargo, N.D., who was waiting at Hector International Airport in
Fargo for Northwest Flight 1074 to Raleigh, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Wangler, 32, refused to worry about how she would get
home from her vacation in 10 days. ``Maybe the last couple days of
the trip I'll worry about getting back,'' she said. ``But until
then, I'm just going to let go and have fun. I figure if I can get
back to Minneapolis, I can make it back to Fargo somehow.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wangler had better not depend on booking a flight with
United Express, the commuter airline that provides the only
scheduled air service to Fargo other than that provided by
Northwest. ``The earliest guaranteed seat isn't until September
9,'' said Steve Dahl, the United Express customer service manager
in Fargo.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest is also the biggest carrier serving North Dakota
airports in Bismarck, Minot and Grand Forks.
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Dobberstein, director of the Municipal Airport Authority
in Fargo, has advised travelers to use such options as Greyhound
and Amtrak.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest said it would cancel an additional 230 flights
Saturday, even if a strike was averted.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers at several airports seemed to be taking the
disruption, and the strike threat, in stride.
</P>
<P>
   Tricia Walker, 23, an accountant from Minneapolis who planned to
visit friends in Kent, Conn., for the weekend, had been booked on
Northwest's 7 p.m. nonstop flight Friday to Hartford, Conn. But an
airline representative told her to be on the 5 p.m. flight, which,
after a layover in Detroit, was scheduled to arrive in Hartford 30
minutes later than her original flight.
</P>
<P>
   Although her return flight is uncertain, Ms. Walker said, ``I'm
crossing my fingers that I can get back on another carrier.''
</P>
<P>
   Susan Harris Layne of New York also did not appear unduly
concerned. Waiting at La Guardia Airport to fly to Minneapolis for
a wedding this weekend, Ms. Layne recalled having been stranded in
Iceland for three days several years ago. ``But this is America,''
she said. ``We'll find our way back.''
</P>
<P>
   Brian Forbes, her traveling companion, was equally unconcerned,
noting that Minneapolis had lots of hotels and ``I've got a credit
card.''
</P>
<P>
   At Northwest's terminal at La Guardia on Friday, passengers were
treated to free muffins, coffee, tea and other refreshments. But
Northwest had few passengers Friday morning or on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very slow last night,'' said Maureen Carlin, a
Northwest customer-service agent. ``We were talking to each other
all night long.''

   In Memphis, Tenn., Eleanor and William Allen of Sharon Hill,
Pa., were awaiting a flight to San Antonio for a Veterans of
Foreign Wars convention. Fifteen minutes after their 6 a.m. flight
took off from Philadelphia on Friday, the plane had to return for
repairs. They arrived in Memphis at 10 a.m., missed their flight to
San Antonio and had to wait for the last flight of the day, at 2
p.m.
</P>

   ``I just hope we don't have to go halfway around the world to

   That Philadelphia-to-Memphis flight carried 11 adults and
children who were going to a beach house near Fort Walton Beach,
Fla. Because they missed their morning connection, Kathy Sheedy, a
lawyer from Red Bank, N.J., negotiated with Northwest to give them
vouchers to store their bags at a local hotel and take cabs to
Graceland, Elvis Presley's home in Memphis, before boarding a
connecting flight to Fort Walton Beach on Friday afternoon.

45% IN POLL SEE LESSENING OF CLINTON'S POWERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Almost half of Massachusetts voters surveyed believe
that President Clinton's ability to perform the duties of his
office has been diminished, according to a new Boston Globe-WBZ
poll.
</P>
<P>
   Of 800 likely voters polled this week by KRC Communications, 45
percent said they thought Clinton's ability to do his job has been
impaired by his relationship with former intern Monica Lewinsky, by
his lying about their relationship, and by allegations that he may
have encouraged her to commit perjury and obstruct justice.
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton vacations with his family on Martha's Vineyard, he
and his aides have been busily trying to shore up Democratic
support among political leaders and the citizenry to prevent a
groundswell of calls for either impeachment or resignation. Clinton
aides say he will need all the help he can get as Congress prepares
to receive independent counsel Kenneth Starr's report on the
Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
   While half the voters polled think Clnton's job performance has
been hurt, 43 percent said they believed Clinton will be unaffected
by the scandal and 5 percent said his job performance will be
enhanced.
</P>
<P>
   More women than men say Clinton's ability to serve in office has
been diminished. Forty-eight percent of female voters in the survey
and 42 percent of male voters said they view Clinton's situation as
damaging to his work.
</P>
<P>
   Like those in the rest of the country, Massachusetts voters
believe Clinton has been lying, but would prefer that the matter be
put to rest, with the president continuing to serve out his term.
Traditionally, Massachusetts has been a bastion of Clinton
admirers, and Clinton's favorability rating has always been
significantly higher here than in the rest of the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``While Massachusetts likes Clinton and thinks it's an issue
that should go away, Massachusetts doesn't believe him,'' said
pollster Gerry Chervinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Only 30 percent of those polled believe that Clinton's
relationship with Lewinsky is worthy of national attention, while
65 percent say it is not. Democratic voters say it is not worthy of
national attention by 81 percent, while 57 percent of Independent
voters and 45 percent of Republican voters say the issue should not
be the subject of national attention.
</P>
<P>
   Voters are far more upset, however, when asked what they think
about Clinton misleading the American people about Lewinsky. Of
everyone polled, 37 percent said it is very serious, and 39 percent
said it is somewhat serious. Twenty-two percent said it is not
serious.
</P>
<P>
   When voters were told that Clinton has denied urging Lewinsky to
lie under oath about their relationship, 50 percent of those polled
said they do not believe him. Only 27 percent said they believed
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that showing, 63 percent say he should not resign and
should not face impeachment. Twenty-two percent said Clinton should
resign or face impeachment, and 11 percent said they needed more
information.

UNHAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU: JANZEN IS DISQUALIFIED
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio)  (jw) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AKRON, Ohio _ An eventful day at the World Series of Golf
featured both controversy and competition.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy involved Lee Janzen, who was disqualified this
morning for signing an incorrect score card. The competition
involved Tiger Woods, David Duval and Craig Parry, who ended Friday
locked in a three-way tie for first place at five under par,
setting the stage for an interesting weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Janzen, who turned 34 Friday, will remember this birthday for
the wrong reasons. After he arrived at Firestone Country Club, he
was summoned into a meeting with tournament officials, who informed
him of their decision to disqualify him. Tipped off by a telephone
call from a television viewer, tournament officials reviewed a
videotape of Janzen's first-round putt on the 17th hole. It was a
putt that stopped tantalizingly close to the cup, with part of the
ball hanging over the lip of the hole. After at least 20 seconds,
the ball finally dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Janzen signed for a 3, but, according to the U.S. Golf
Association rules, Janzen should have signed for a 4. Rule 16-2
states that when the ball overhangs the hole, and the player is
allowed time to reach the hole without reasonable delay, then the
player is given an additional 10 seconds to determine if the ball
is at rest. After 10 seconds, the ball is deemed to be at rest, and
even if it eventually falls into the hole, the player is assessed a
penalty stroke.
</P>
<P>
   Janzen did not intentionally violate the rule, and both he and
his Thursday playing partner, Vijay Singh, felt that Janzen was
within the 10-second limit. But that didn't matter. Janzen was out
of the tournament. And understandably, the two-time U.S. Open
champion was upset.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no intention of breaking any rule,'' Janzen said before
leaving. ``Strange things happen on the course, and this was one of
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it was strange. After Janzen stroked the fateful putt,
he walked to the hole, then past it, then stared at it, wondering
why the ball wouldn't drop. Singh walked over to take a peak as
well. Finally, after at least 20 seconds, the ball dropped. Janzen
laughed, and the gallery cheered.
</P>
<P>
   Janzen said he was afraid to tap in the putt, because players
are not permitted to strike a moving ball under Rule 19. However,
when the ball is hanging over the lip of the hole, Rule 16-2
supersedes Rule 19. If Janzen had tapped in the putt while it was
moving, he would not have been disqualified, as long as he signed
for a 4 instead of a 3.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more well-known incidents of fans' calling in with a
rule violation and a player's being penalized came in 1987 at the
Andy Williams Open in San Diego. Craig Stadler, who was among the
third-round leaders, needed to kneel down under a tree branch to
execute a fairway shot. He used a towel to shield his pants from
wet grass.
</P>
<P>
   Television viewers flooded tournament officials with phone calls
when they saw tape of Stadler's antics before that Sunday's final
round. He had broken Rule 13-3, which prohibits ``building a
stance.'' Stadler, like Janzen, was subsequently disqualified
because he failed to assess the proper penalty when signing his
score card.
</P>
<P>
   Janzen, who was 43rd out of 44 golfers after Thursday's first
round here, will still be paid last-place money ($18,475), though
that sum will not count on the official money list.
</P>
<P>
   This was not the first time that Rule 16-2 had been mentioned in
a prominent tournament. At the 1985 U.S. Open, Denis Watson
assessed himself a one-stroke penalty for waiting too long for a
putt to fall. Watson finished in a three-way tie for second, one
shot behind Andy North.
</P>
<P>
   So this World Series of Golf continued without Janzen, and the
weekend has compelling potential. Shooting a 66 on Friday, Duval
soared from a tie for ninth place into a tie for first place with
Woods and Parry, both of whom shot 68 Friday.  &QL;

 &HT;    Cox gives Klesko shot against lefty starter
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Bobby Cox gave Ryan Klesko a rare start against a
left-hander Friday night and it had nothing to do with his 1-for-4
history against St. Louis' Kent Mercker either.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never even looked,'' Cox said. ``I just want to get him some
at-bats. He's trying some different things and he needs to get in
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Klesko needs something. The club's leading home run hitter the
past two seasons, Klesko has fallen to sixth this year with 16, a
disturbing pattern for a power hitter who has seen his homer
production drop from 30 to 24 the previous two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   While keeping his average near .280 the last eight weeks, he has
not hit a homer since Aug. 5 and has hit just three in the second
half. He is on pace to drive in 72 runs, which would also be a
three-year low.
</P>
<P>
   ``The year ain't over,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of his trouble stems from his June 29 appendectomy, which
disrupted his most productive month of the season (.382 with five
homers and 16 RBIs in 21 June starts). But his bat has slipped so
far down and back in his stance that he is having trouble handling
inside fastballs, which had been his staple.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's gone through about three or four stances,'' said hitting
coach Clarence Jones. ``He's got to find one he's comfortable with.
He's got to get that relaxed feeling again.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is disturbing,'' said Cox, ``because he is a power hitter.
Sixteen is not a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   It is also disturbing because Klesko is in the first season of a
four-year $20.5-million contract, reflective of the Braves'
confidence that he could provide a left-handed anchor in the middle
of the order into the next century. At present, he is fifth on the
club in RBI (60).
</P>
<P>
   ``The last two weeks, I've had like six starts (actually 10)
because there's been a barrage of left-handers,'' Klesko said.
``I'm trying to find my swing from where it was before my surgery.
I've been back and forth (between swings) the whole time. I'm not
dissatisfied. I'm not hitting .220. I'm hitting .280. It's just my
power numbers are down.''
</P>
<P>
   History lesson
</P>
<P>
   When Andruw Jones reaches 25 homers _ he opened play Friday with
23 _ the Braves will have four players with 25 or more for the
first time in Atlanta history. The last Braves club with four
25-homer seasons played in Milwaukee in 1965, with Hank Aaron (32),
Eddie Mathews (32), Mack Jones (31) and Joe Torre (27).
</P>
<P>
   Day in court
</P>
<P>
   The Braves have been notified Andres Galarraga's appeal for his
three-game suspension will be heard next Tuesday, when National
League president Len Coleman will be in Atlanta. If his appeal is
denied, Galarraga should expect to start serving the suspension
immediately, meaning he would sit out the last two games of the
Houston series at Turner Field and a Friday game in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Dispatch from Richmond
</P>
<P>
   Four years after the Braves took him in the fourth round of the
1994 draft, Wes Helms drew his first breath in the major leagues
Friday, celebrating the occasion by slamming a batting practice
homer off the glassed-in restaurant in the second deck above left
field of Busch Stadium. After bombing out in Class AAA Richmond
last year, Helms was leading the team with 75 RBI Thursday when the
club called him up, thinking Chipper Jones has sustained a rib cage
injury. Cox asked Helms Friday if he could play the outfield (he
did in high school but was drafted as a shortstop), which may be
the foreshadowing of Helms' eventual fate in the organization.

 &HT;    On Deck: ST. LOUIS CARDINALS
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When: 1:15 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Where: Busch Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   TV/radio: WAGA (Channel 5); 750-AM.
</P>
<P>
   Probable starting pitchers: LHP Tom Glavine (17-5, 2.57; 11-4,
3.73 lifetime vs. Cardinals) vs. RHP Kent Bottenfield (4-5, 4.51;
1-1, 1.80 lifetime vs. Braves).
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Glavine's 17 victories already surpass any of his four
previous seasons. He is destined for his first 20-victory campaign
since going 22-6 in 1993, his career best. With at least four,
perhaps five, more starts this season, he might match it. Glavine
is coming off a 4-3 victory over Los Angeles, when he gave up 10
hits, resigned himself to a loss and then watched the Braves score
four in the eighth off Jeff Shaw. He is 5-2 in the second half, but
has given up only 13 runs in his last 60 innings (1.95 ERA) thanks
mainly to back-to-back shutouts Aug. 7 against San Francisco and
Aug. 13 against San Diego. Bottenfield, released by the Cubs last
winter, made the Cardinals as a middle reliever but joined the
rotation on June 15, when Donovan Osborne, who has since returned
to action, was sidelined. Bottenfield is 3-3 as a starter with a
4.09 ERA. It will be his 15th start. In previous stints with
Montreal, Colorado, San Francisco and Chicago, he started a total
of 30 games, going 6-11 with a 5.04 ERA. He drew no decision in an
Aug. 1 game at Turner Field, throwing seven shutout innings before
the Braves scored three time off Rich Croushore in the eighth to
win 3-1.

ANGELS SHOW WHY THEY'RE IN PENNANT RACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It may have been forgotten, but there is a pennant
contender in town this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The Anaheim Angels, currently in first place in the AL West,
just came off a five-game series in which they beat the mighty New
York Yankees three times. They added to their success by beating
the Red Sox, 7-3, in the opener of a three-game series Friday
night.
</P>
<P>
   But they have plenty to come on road trip; after their
three-game set against the Red Sox, they'll meet another likely
playoff team, the Cleveland Indians. No one has to tell the Angels
that if they don't make a good showing on this trip, they might
drop out of first. And that's something they don't want to discuss.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got our work cut out for us,'' said Angels general
manager Bill Bavasi. ``But it sure beats the alternative. I'd
rather be nine games up on the spot I want than where we are. The
Sox are probably trying to get ready for postseason. We're just
trying to get there.''
</P>
<P>
   Where the Angels wanted to be was on Easy Street, not fighting
for their postseason lives. Anaheim has five games left with the
Texas, Rangers, their closest pursuer, inclduing three at home. Its
final four games are at Oakland, the divisional cellardweller. But
as far as the Angels are concerned, the race is in high gear right
now.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim won the season series over the Yankees, while leading
the Red Sox by a game with two to play. Texas can tell you how
tough the road can be. On their last swing of New York, Boston, and
Cleveland earlier this month, they were under .500 and saw a 1
1/2-game lead change to a 2 1/2-game deficit.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why getting out of this road trip with our head above
water is important,'' said Angels manager Terry Collins. ``We got
off to a great start in New York. But we've got a tough weekend
ahead and we've got to go to Cleveland next. If we get out of this
month with our lineup intact and a healthy Jack McDowell and Ken
Hill, we should be OK. Then it should really be a good last
month.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels finished six games behind Seattle in last season's AL
West race and after several off-season moves started the year as
the co-favorite. The club had a new chemistry, with veterans Cecil
Fielder, Randy Velarde, and Dave Hollins expected to fit into the
middle of a talented young nucleus that included players like Tim
Salmon, Gary DiSarcina, Jim Edmonds, Garrett Anderson, Todd Greene,
and Darin Erstad. As late as May 22, the Angels were as many as six
games out.
</P>
<P>
   How they jump-started the effort this still puzzles some
observers. McDowell and Hill were lost for legnthy periods due to
injuries. So were Erstad, Salmon, Velarde, Allen Watson, Hollins,
Mike James, and Charlie O'Brien. But the Angels are tough and show
up to play every game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The five games in New York,'' said hitting instructor Rod
Carew, ``were five of the most grueling games they've gone through
this year. They didn't quit.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins won't let them quit. He has re-tooled his lineup with
his style of players. It worked. On Aug. 5, just after the club had
failed to pull the trigger on a deal before the Aug. 1 deadline,
the Angels stunned the West Coast by designating the powerful
Fielder for assignment. He had started the year in the middle of
the Angels lineup. He left as a guy in the middle of all that was
wrong. Collins told his troops to return to the style of play
they'd used in his first season as manager in 1997, one that had
worked for him in Houston. So far, so good.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cecil is the greatest guy in the world,'' said Collins. ``But
we had to change the way we were playing. We weren't hitting home
runs. We weren't driving in runs. We had to do something to create
a different way to go about the game. What had made us good last
year was that we ran the bases great. We moved runners and got
runs. We've added more speed to the lineup and now try to create
more energy on the club. We're going to get better at it. If we can
take this guys and play a certain way, we can say that have a real
good club.''
</P>
<P>
   With McDowell and Hill rejoining the rotation, the Angels may
finally move away from the dark cloud that has hovered over the
club since the trading deadline. There was major criticism when the
Angels stood pat and didn't pull off a deal for a No. 1 starter.
People thought Disney, if no one else, would demand a deal be made.
Baseball minds prevailed. Bavasi still feels the club made the
right decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``We refused to make a deal to just make a deal,'' said Bavasi.
``I It doesn't haunt us. We've played pretty hard without making
one. I feel bad we couldn't find good deals to make. But I don't
feel bad that we didnt make bad deals.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is anything that is disturbing, it's that a lot of
made by people saying, `How are you doing it? How are they staying
in contention with so many injuries and no trade?' Well, that's not
giving these guys enough credit. They're good players who play the
game the way it should be played ... hard every night. Can they do
it the next 29-30 days? We'll see.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do people want most in a trade?,'' he asked. ``Either
pitching or young players in return. We wanted to find a pitcher.
What did they want back? Young, talented guys. Well, ours are in
the big leagues.''

TENNIS THROWBACK IN FOREST HILLS IS IN JEOPARDY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By VIVIAN S. TOY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The view at dusk from the Tudor clubhouse terrace at
the West Side Tennis Club in Forest Hills, Queens, is as
magnificent as it ever was.
</P>
<P>
   In the foreground, neatly trimmed grass tennis courts stand
shoulder to shoulder, while red and green clay courts flow to the
right and left. And the stadium _ where thousands of fans cheered
as the likes of Billie Jean King and Arthur Ashe made tennis
history _ rises elegantly toward the sky.
</P>
<P>
   But beneath the towering arches of the 14,000-seat arena, years
of disuse have taken their toll. Porcelain water fountains are
chipped and dry. Cracks in the concrete have been patched and
repatched. Telephone booths stand empty without phones.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since 1978, when the U.S. Open abandoned Forest Hills to
move to a bigger and plusher home two miles away, in Flushing
Meadows, the fate of the stadium has been an open question. But
now, as the tennis world prepares for the start of this year's Open
on Monday, club officials are considering tearing down the
nostalgia-laden stadium, sparking a contentious fight within the
club between those wanting to defend its heritage and others who
worry about the finances of an aging country club with a shrinking
membership.
</P>
<P>
   The club has already received six proposals for different types
of housing complexes and will accept bids until the end of
September. But the sale and later demolition of the stadium, whose
courts club members still sometimes play on and which is also
occasionally used for concerts, is by no means a foregone
conclusion. Two-thirds of the club's 400 voting members must
approve such a monumental change, and the outcome of a vote is
still as unpredictable as John McEnroe's temper.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stadium is a landmark and I'd hate to see it go,'' said
James Frangos, a former president of the club. ``It would be like
selling your grandmother's heirlooms, and it's something you do
only as an absolute last resort.'' So far, no vote has been
scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   William Maloney, the current president, said that while many
members feel the stadium is an important monument to the past,
others feel that it is outdated and part of a bygone era. In the
end, he said, the decision would be ``a function of fiscal analysis
and cost-benefits for the club.''
</P>
<P>
   Change of any kind comes slowly at a place like the 106-year-old
West Side Tennis Club, which has its origins on the Upper West Side
of Manhattan but moved to Queens in 1913. For example, the club
next year will finally get a swimming pool, but it took club
members 20 years to thoroughly thrash out the issue and approve the
construction.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the club's older members remember when the U.S. Open was
played on grass at Forest Hills. The halls of the clubhouse are
lined with photographs of American tennis stars going back to Bill
Tilden and Helen Wills. Silver trophies from tournaments of yore
decorate the lounge.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's more than 100 years of history here,'' said Howard
Gordon, a member of the board of governors. ``Some of it good, some
of it not,'' he added, alluding to the club's restrictive policies
in the past that prevented blacks and Jews from becoming members.
</P>
<P>
   But in the last two decades, the voting membership has declined
to just under 400 from about 750. (A nonvoting population of
members who do not play tennis but use the clubhouse for its
restaurant and bridge tournaments has held steady at about 300.)
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For years, club officials have been grappling with how to
attract new members to a club that charges an initiation fee of
about $3,000 and annual dues of about $5,000 for a family and
$2,400 for an individual.
</P>
<P>
   They said they hoped that the new pool would broaden the appeal.
``Times have changed,'' Gordon said. ``You have to give the young
people something besides just tennis.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the question of the stadium, which sustained
itself through the 1980s with the Tournament of Champions _ an
event that attracted big-name players like McEnroe, Ivan Lendl and
Andre Agassi. But after that tournament folded in 1990, the club
has been unable to attract another tournament to replace it.
</P>
<P>
   The club has also tried to restore the luster of the stadium as
an outdoor concert site. The Beatles and the Rolling Stones played
Forest Hills in the 1960s. But just as tennis outgrew Forest Hills,
so apparently did rock 'n' roll.
</P>
<P>
   There have been only about half a dozen concerts in the last
decade. Two concerts this summer included a popular Japanese rock
band called the Alfee and a Caribbean festival of reggae and
calypso.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stadium helped put Forest Hills on the map,'' said Linda
Hoffman, a member of the corporation's board. ``So we would feel
sad to see it torn down, but if it's necessary for the club to
remain in existence then it has to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   Many professional tennis players remember Forest Hills fondly.
</P>
<P>
   While less charitable in her descriptions of the stadium in an
autobiography 25 years ago, Billie Jean King, who won four U.S.
Open titles at Forest Hills, said this week that she would never
forget the view from the terrace of the clubhouse, which looks out
on the open side of the horseshoe-shaped stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sitting there and watching the sun go down behind the stadium
_ you'll never see another sight like that in tennis,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Stan Smith, who won the U.S. Open in 1971, said he went back to
watch a tennis match there about 10 years ago and was saddened to
see how much the place had deteriorated.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look back, it's hard to imagine that it worked at
all, he said, ``because it was so small and there was no parking
for fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I always tell people that I can say I won Forest Hills,
and now when you say you won Flushing, it just doesn't have the
same ring.''

the economy to snap back to more than 3 percent real growth in the
last two quarters. (Nancy Siesel/New York Times Photo)

on divisions among the skinheads, a vaguely defined subculture
whose definition is the subject of fierce debate. (Andrew

   RUSSIAN INSTABILITY SENDS STOCK PRICES EVEN LOWER
</P>
<P>
   Stock prices fell sharply for the second straight day as
continued fears about instability in Russia and economic weakness
closer to home led the stock market to its worst week in nine
years.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average declined 114.31 points, or 1.4
percent, finishing the week at 8,051.68, down 5.6 percent over the
five days. Not since October 1989, when the Dow fell 7.8 percent,
has the bellwether market gauge fallen so far in the span of a
week.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury prices ended slightly higher, extending a rally
sustained by investors fleeing turmoil on world markets.
</P>
<P>
   The recent turmoil has weakened several Latin American
currencies and drastically reduced the wealth of many Latin
companies, raising prospects that governments in the region may be
forced to take sterner measures to contain the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   European stock markets were led down by the London Stock
Exchange, which fell 2.2 percent. Frankfurt closed down 1.7
percent, and stock markets in Eastern Europe were also swept by a
wave of selling.
</P>
<P>
   NO ECONOMIC HELP FROM JAPAN
</P>
<P>
   Japanese stocks dropped in value by $241 billion this week, a
sum that was the financial equivalent of erasing Russia from the
world map for a year. Japan is central to the health of the global
economy, but it remains firmly in recession and largely paralyzed
politically and economically.
</P>
<P>
   BROKERAGE FIRMS FEEL PINCH AT HOME
</P>
<P>
   While banks have seen values tumble because of international
worries, Wall Street's brokerage firms and investment banks are
troubled by more mundane concerns at home: fear that equity
underwriting and trading in fixed-income products will not be as
lucrative this year.
</P>
<P>
   ECONOMY CONTRACTS IN PHILIPPINES
</P>
<P>
   The Philippines, becoming the latest Asian country to report an
economic contraction, said its gross domestic product declined in
the second quarter at an annual rate of 1.2 percent, worse than
economists' forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   PASSENGERS BRACE FOR AIRLINE STRIKE
</P>
<P>
   There were no signs of panic at Northwest Airlines terminals or
ticket counters as the United States' fourth-biggest carrier and
its pilots union met well into the night to avert a strike. But
confusion and concern were evident among many passengers.
</P>
<P>
   CONSUMER SPENDING FELL IN JULY
</P>
<P>
   Consumer spending dropped in July for the first time in more
than two years as the strikes at General Motors took a toll on auto
sales. Analysts said falling stock prices could cause spending to
weaken further in the months ahead.
</P>
<P>
   OXFORD HEALTH CHIEF OUTLINES PLAN
</P>
<P>
   At the annual meeting of Oxford Health Plans, whose stock has
plunged more than 90 percent since last summer, the chief executive
outlined a turnaround strategy and fielded questions from a packed
room of shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   DEAL FOR FRENCH SUPERMARKET CHAIN
</P>
<P>
   Carrefour, France's biggest retailer, said it had agreed to buy
Comptoirs Modernes, a supermarket chain, in a cash-and-stock deal
worth up to $2.38 billion.

ACCIDENTAL FIRE HEAVILY SCARS LANDMARK SYNAGOGUE IN NYC 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ROBERT D. McFADDEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Central Synagogue on Manhattan's East Side, a
126-year-old twin-towered architectural treasure of Moorish
inspiration that is a national and city landmark and the oldest
temple in New York state in continuous use by one Jewish
congregation, was heavily damaged Friday in a roaring five-alarm
fire.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently sparked by a workman's blowtorch during renovations,
orange-red flames and dense gray-black smoke shot through the roof
of the sandstone and limestone Reform synagogue at 652 Lexington
Ave., on the southwest corner of 55th Street, as the evening rush
hour got under way shortly after 5 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   No one was killed or seriously injured in the fire, which raged
out of control for three hours and sent heavy smoke billowing over
the city.
</P>
<P>
   As commuters and congregants watched grimly, many of them
sobbing, and firefighters shot streams of water from the streets,
from tower ladders and even from terraces on adjacent buildings,
the flames attacked the synagogue's roof, breaking through at
several points and eventually destroying almost the entire roof.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, falling flames and cascading torrents of water
heavily damaged the synagogue's magnificent interior, with its
stenciled and handpainted walls of rich blues, earthy reds, ochres
and gold in dazzling geometric designs, with its muted stained
glass windows and ebonized woodwork.
</P>
<P>
   As twilight slowly painted the sky with streaks of darkness and
the last flaming embers and smoke drifted up, more than 250
firefighters who had used 45 trucks finally brought the fire under
control just before 8 p.m., and a congregation that had existed for
more than a century and a half faced a harsh reality.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   While the damage was great, officials said the synagogue's
collection of Judaica, its archives dating to the 1870s, many of
its early architectural drawings and many of its sacred Torah
scrolls were out of harm's way, having been removed in recent
months in preparation for a renovation project.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the remaining Torah scrolls were taken from the ark
and saved, officials said, and the renovation project, which
included interior and roof work and the installation of new
air-conditioners, had closed the synagogue for the summer, with
services moved to a temple community house across 55th Street, so
that no one but workmen were inside when the fire broke out.
</P>
<P>
   But to many congregants, the fire was nonetheless devastating.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am heartbroken,'' Sara Gorfinkle, a member of the
congregation for 10 years, said as she looked up solemnly at
billowing smoke and leaping flames. ``I heard about the fire on the
radio and I had to come down and see it. This is terrible. This is
breaking my heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Peter Rubenstein, the Central Synagogue's senior rabbi,
said: ``This is a national and city landmark and more than that it
is the soul of the congregation. Fortunately, the Torah scrolls had
been taken out of the building.''
</P>
<P>
   And, he said, ``Already our Christian neighbors and friends have
offered the use of their facilities for the High Holy Days,'' which
begin in mid-September.
</P>
<P>
   The congregation has 1,400 members, he said, but as many as
5,000 attend High Holy Day services, the most sacred of the year
for Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who went to the scene, said there
appeared to be nothing suspicious about the fire, which was
apparently started by a workman using a propane torch to perform
some soldering on the roof. ``The fire marshal is pretty confident
that this fire looks like an accident,'' the mayor said.
</P>
<P>
   First Deputy Fire Commissioner William Feehan said workmen were
soldering copper flashing around air ducts on a flat portion of the
roof near the front when some saw smoke. They stopped soldering, he
said, pulled up the flashing and tried to put out what appeared to
be a small fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``They thought they had extinguished the fire, but the fire was
under the roof boards,'' Feehan said. He said the flames soon
spread under the roof and were far advanced by the time the first
firefighters arrived at 5:13 p.m., six minutes after the alarm was
turned in.
</P>
<P>
   The synagogue struck by the flames Friday dates from 1872.
Designed by the Prussian-born Jewish architect Henry Fernbach _ one
of the first Jewish architects in America _ it is regarded as a
masterpiece of the Moorish Revival style.
</P>
<P>
   Its brooding facade of sandstone with limestone features banded
arches, and twin, 122-foot minaret towers capped by bronze onion
domes, the whole structure modeled after the Dohany Street
synagogue in Budapest, but reflecting the style of the Moors in
Spain.
</P>
<P>
   It has a rich history. The synagogue was commissioned by a
congregation of Jews from Bohemia, called Ahawath Chesed, that was
founded on Ludlow Street on the Lower East Side in 1846, when the
Jewish population of the city was only 12,000 out of 500,000
residents. By 1872, when the synagogue was built, the city's
population had grown to 900,000, with 120,000 Jews.
</P>
<P>
   The congregation merged in 1898 with the members of Shaar
Hasomayim and took its current name in 1920. The city's Landmarks
Preservation Commission designated the synagogue a landmark in
1966, and it was named a National Historic Landmark in 1975, the
only synagogue in the state to have such status.

TOLEDO HAS TO CALM BRUINS DOWN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   One week of training camp down, one week to go, and here's what
UCLA knows:
</P>
<P>
   __Enthusiasm is high. Almost too high, in fact. Coach Bob Toledo
has interrupted practice several times to lecture the Bruins on
uncontrolled aggression (i.e.: contact during non-contact drills).
</P>
<P>
   Emotions are especially high on defense, where nine starting
positions are open.
</P>
<P>
   __The tailback concerns are abating. Jermaine Lewis, Keith Brown
and DeShaun Foster have played well enough to ease Toledo's worries
about replacing Skip Hicks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have three guys who are ready to play, but we can't afford
many injuries,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   __Jason Bell and Marques Anderson are a step ahead of the pack
at cornerback. They entered camp as the starters and are holding
steady. Damian Allen, Ryan Roques and true freshman Julius Williams
are the challengers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Williams is making strides,'' Toledo said. ``We're going to
take a good, hard look at him.''
</P>
<P>
   __There is quality depth at linebacker, with 10 players
seemingly ready to contribute, but only one established performer,
Brendan Ayanbadejo.
</P>
<P>
   Nagging injuries have slowed Michael Wiley and Ramogi Huma,
former reserves expected to start. Ayanbadejo aside, Tony White
appears the best bet to contribute consistently.
</P>
<P>
   __The defensive line has two established players: ends Kenyon
Coleman and Pete Holland. Sophomore nose guard Micah Webb has
improved and is No.1 for now. Freshman Ken Kocher, whose
combination of size (290 pounds) and mobility is unprecedented in
UCLA history, suffered a bruised/sprained ankle Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   He is listed as day-to-day but probably will not scrimmage
today.
</P>
<P>
   Kocher is one of three massive, highly touted freshman defensive
linemen. Anthony Fletcher (293 pounds) may play; no decision has
been made. But Sean Phillips (280 pounds) is expected to redshirt.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to be a heck of a player, but today he's not
ready,'' Toledo said of Phillips.
</P>
<P>
   Going at it: The Bruins will scrimmage (closed to the public)
this afternoon at Spaulding Field. It's a controlled scrimmage,
meaning all plays are prearranged and several starters _
quarterback Cade McNown and safety Larry Atkins, for instance _
will participate only for a few minutes. Three positions of
interest are tailback, free safety and inside linebacker.

 &HT;    Lemond: Drug scandal is best thing to happen to cycling
 &HT;    By Arthur Brice
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- America's most famous cyclist hopes something good
will come out of the drug scandal that engulfed this year's Tour de
France, a race he won three times.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the best thing that's happened in cycling,'' said Greg
LeMond, now driving on the Forumla Ford 2000 circuit and competing
tonight at Atlanta Motor Speedway. ``The worst would be for drugs
to stay on the back side and nobody doing anything about it.''
</P>
<P>
   This year's Tour de France, a three-week bike race held every
July, was marked by controversy. The world's top-ranked team was
kicked out for suspected drug use, and another six squads quit.
Police are still investigating.
</P>
<P>
   LeMond, who retired in 1994 after winning the Tour in 1986, 1989
and 1990, said he always has detested drug use.
</P>
<P>
   ``I raced a clean career,'' he said. ``I made it very clear. I
was fortunate to be on certain teams that wouldn't tolerate it.''
</P>
<P>
   LeMond even left one squad when his contract expired, he said,
because one of its riders was caught using drugs and the team
directors did not do anything about it.
</P>
<P>
   But LeMond said that in a sport in which athletes often pedal
eight hours a day for weeks at a time, some competitors look for
any advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is so physically demanding that even a slight edge can make
a difference,'' he said. ``I don't believe any rider wants to take
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there's a huge temptation to maintain equality.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though cycling has been under suspicion since 1967, when a
British rider died of amphetamine use during the Tour de France,
drug use picked up eight or nine years ago, LeMond said.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is drug use limited to cycling. Running and swimming, along
with professional sports such as football, have been tainted by
scandal. In recent weeks, three 1996 Olympians _ a swimmer, a
weightlifter and a sprinter _ have been accused of possible doping.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything you take, there's a side effect,'' said LeMond, who
was forced to retire because of a rare genetic muscle disease. ``I
wanted to get done with cycling with my health.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ironic thing is I ended up finishing unhealthy.''

STEADY GRAF EARNS RIGHT TO MEET NOVOTNA FOR TITLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JACK CAVANAUGH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW HAVEN, Conn. _ Steffi Graf continued her comeback in
dramatic fashion Friday night, recovering from a 5-0 deficit in the
second-set tie breaker to beat top-seeded Lindsay Davenport, 6-3,
7-6 (8-6), and advance to the final of the Pilot Pen International
tennis championships.
</P>
<P>
   By winning seven of the last eight points in the tie breaker,
after having squandered a 5-2 lead in the second set, the
29-year-old Graf earned the right to meet Jana Novotna, the
reigning Wimbledon champion who is seeded No. 2 here, on Saturday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   After losing five consecutive games, during which she failed to
capitalize on a match point on her serve in the 10th game, Graf
seemed destined to lose the set when a rejuvenated Davenport won
the first five points of the tie breaker.
</P>
<P>
   But Graf, playing in only her ninth tournament of the year after
a long recovery following knee surgery, overcame a set point by
Davenport at 6-5 and eventually closed out the match with a service
winner.
</P>
<P>
   That Davenport _ who had won 15 matches and 3 tournaments in a
row _ managed to stay as close as she did was somewhat remarkable,
because Graf broke her big service the first five times in the
match and seven of her first eight service games.
</P>
<P>
   But then the 6-foot-2-inch Davenport, moving much better since
losing 30 pounds over the last three years, also managed to break
Graf's vaunted serve in the fourth, eighth and 10th games of the
second set.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it was Graf's forehand and steadier backhand _ and,
it seemed, her championship mettle _ that made the difference
against Davenport.
</P>
<P>
   Davenport won this tournament last year, when it was the U.S.
Hardcourts Championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``She got a little tight in he second set but then she started
playing great in the tie breaker,'' said Davenport, who was treated
for a sore right wrist several times during the match before a
crowd of about 6,000 at the Connecticut Tennis Center. ``She's
obviously a great champion.''
</P>
<P>
   For Graf, it marked the first time that she has made it to a
final this year.
</P>
<P>
   Three times she had reached a semifinal, but in two of those
instances she had been beaten by Davenport, who had defeated her
three times in their last four meetings.
</P>
<P>
   But Friday night, she was facing a Graf who is approaching the
form that has won 21 Grand Slam titles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was definitely not happy that I let it slip away from me in
he second set,'' said Graf, who had entered this tournament late as
a wild card after having won 14 of 21 matches this year. ``I just
got nervous and tight and didn't go for my shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to relax and it didn't work.''
</P>
<P>
   For future tournament play, Graf said, her shaky experience in
the second set _ which required her to raise the level of her play
under pressure _ should prove beneficial.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will definitely give me the confidence that I really need
to start next week,'' she said, alluding to the U.S. Open, which
she has won five times.
</P>
<P>
   In Novotna, Graf will be meeting a longtime rival. Graf has won
26 of 30 meetings against Novotna.
</P>
<P>
   Novotna, also 29, gained Saturday's final with a 6-4, 6-4
victory over unseeded Julie Halard-Decugis of France in Friday
night's opening match.
</P>
<P>
   Novotna had won 19 straight matches since the French Open until
she was beaten by Arantxa Sanchez Vicario in the semifinals of last
week's du Maurier Open in Montreal.

IT'S TOMISUE'S DELIGHT'S TURN TO LEAD FILLIES AT SARATOGA
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. _ It was supposed to be a replay of their
classic battle four weeks ago, but Saratoga's capricious fates
forced a surprise ending Friday: Aldiza and Escena, two of the
finest fillies in the country, fell out of the money while
Tomisue's Delight was flying through the homestretch and winning
the $400,000 Personal Ensign Handicap by two lengths.
</P>
<P>
   The same three fillies raced in the Go For Wand Handicap at
Saratoga on Aug. 2, and finished in this order: Aldiza by a nose
over Escena, who had three lengths on Tomisue's Delight. But when
they ran an eighth of a mile farther Friday, it was Tomisue's
Delight first, Escena sixth and Aldiza eighth and last.
</P>
<P>
   The two losing fillies came with all kinds of pedigrees and
connections, but no excuses.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Mott, the trainer of the favorite Escena, owned by Allen
Paulson with Jerry Bailey riding, said flatly: ``There was no
excuse for her. She just came up empty.'' Bailey, after leading for
one mile to the head of the stretch, said: ``All I can say is, it
wasn't her best race. She ran hard and had everything her own way.
She just didn't have the kick when the others came to her.''
</P>
<P>
   Shug McGaughey, the trainer of Aldiza, owned by Helen Alexander
of King Ranch Farm and her mother, Helen Groves, was even more
terse. He was the trainer of Personal Ensign, who retired with a
13-for-13 record and who gave her name to the race, formerly known
as the John A. Morris Handicap.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have nothing to say about the race,'' McGaughey said with an
air of finality. And his jockey, Mike Smith said: ``The filly just
couldn't get her air today. After four and a half furlongs, I could
really hear her gasping for air.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheerier comments came from the winner's camp. Neil Howard, who
trains Tomisue's Delight for Stephen Hilbert, noted that his filly
had won her sixth race in 17 starts and had run in the money 14
times.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's put up a lot of seconds and thirds in graded company,''
Howard said.
</P>
<P>
   Tomisue's Delight ran the mile and one-quarter in 2:04, paid
$10.40 for a $2 bet to win and earned $240,000 and possibly a shot
at the Breeders' Cup Distaff in November. The long shot Tuzia
finished second by a neck over One Rich Lady.
</P>
<P>
   While all this was going on with the fillies, the colts were
either jogging, galloping or resting for their $750,000 Travers
Stakes on Saturday, with Coronado's Quest and Victory Gallop the
chief candidates to gain some yardage on the injured Real Quiet for
the 3-year-old championship.
</P>
<P>
   Victory Gallop, the slight favorite at 7-5 and the only veteran
of the Triple Crown races in the field of eight, galloped over the
main track this morning with his ``rabbit'' stablemate, Sheila's
Flag. But Elliott Walden, who trains both, was still somewhat
tight-lipped.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to talk to anyone yesterday,'' he said on
Friday, ``because I wanted it to be a surprise that I entered
Sheila's Flag.''
</P>
<P>
   McGaughey, the trainer of Coronado's Quest, the second choice at
8-5 and the winner of four in a row, reported that his star had
galloped a mile and a half, and said on Friday, ``He'll just gallop
about a mile tomorrow morning, and we'll be set.''
</P>
<P>
   FINISH LINES:
</P>
<P>
   You do not often see the Horse of the Year running on the under
card, but Favorite Trick will skip the Travers distance of a mile
and a quarter Saturday and aim instead for seven-eighths of a mile
in the King's Bishop Stakes. He has won 11 of his 13 starts with a
third- and an eighth-place finish. The field of eight colts
includes Limit Out, who has won four of his six starts for Allen
Jerkens.  &QL;

 TENNIS COLUMN: FOR GIBSON, HER LEGACY TO TENNIS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Early Friday morning, three New Jersey mayors stood shoulder to
shoulder in East Orange City Hall. One by one they invoked the
image of Althea Gibson, the first African-American to win a major
tennis title. In 1957 and '58, Gibson was the dominant player in
the world.
</P>
<P>
   The mayors initially gathered to support the establishment of
the Althea Gibson Foundation by friends, and to promote a gala that
will be held in New York on Sunday to raise money for the
foundation. After short presentations, the politicians recalled the
powerful impact Gibson had on their lives in 1957 when she won her
first Wimbledon title.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Robert Bowser of East Orange recalled how news of Gibson's
victory at Wimbledon was met with shouts and cheers from neighbors
listening on the radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone went out and bought a racket,'' he said. ``Tennis
seemed to be another way out.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Sarah Bost of the Township of Irvington said that when she
was growing up, there were few black female role models. The idea
of Gibson winning something so distant and elitist as a Wimbledon
title opened new vistas of possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Mims Hacket, the mayor of Orange Township, recalled being a
junior high school student in Birmingham, Ala. Rosa Parks' refusal
to give up her seat and move to the back of the bus in 1955
triggered the Montgomery bus boycotts. Gibson's victory seemed part
of the burgeoning civil rights movement.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson burst through one of the most enduring pillars of
segregation in the United States. But tennis has proved to be more
resistant to marches and protest than have lunch counters and
public accommodations.
</P>
<P>
   The status of race and racism in tennis is raised every year
around this time, when the U.S. Open is played in New York City.
This year, William Washington, an African-American whose son,
MaliVai, is a professional player, has threatened to lead pickets
and demonstrations to call attention to the lack of a black
presence within the U.S. Tennis Association.
</P>
<P>
   But the cry for more black faces must become a bit more precise.
When Gibson played, the grip of segregation was so suffocating that
the call for a mere increase in numbers playing the game seemed
appropriate. In 1998 the question Washington must answer is: Would
you rather have a black face or a strong African-American presence?
The two no longer go hand in hand, if they ever did.
</P>
<P>
   The USTA argues that it has increased the number of
African-American employees. Who are the employees? And how hard is
the USTA pushing, fighting to find more Althea Gibsons by scouring
the Harlems of the world?
</P>
<P>
   In any event, tennis is what it is: snooty. Snooty at a level
that often goes beyond race.
</P>
<P>
   The sport clings to its country-club roots even as it craves
something new.
</P>
<P>
   Tennis is eager, anxious _ indeed desperate _ for something new,
something colorful. The sport is crazy for Venus Williams to do
well.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson wanted to play tennis. She never wanted to be a race
warrior, but she was forced by time and circumstance to play take
on that bitter role. She suffered deep scars that apparently have
never healed.
</P>
<P>
   There will never be another Althea Gibson, She lived an eclectic
life, not drenched in the traditional country-club path to tennis.
She played paddle ball on the street and was street-wise at an
early age. Her father taught her to box, and she was kicking
behinds _ boys' and girls' _ at an early age. Racism made her
tougher, focused, but it also cut her deeply.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson was the pride and joy of black and white Americans. She
was an inspiration to women, and a quintessential American story of
perseverance as significant in some ways as Jackie Robinson's. She
was the first black woman to break through in an elitist sport.
</P>
<P>
   From a sharecropping family in Alabama to Harlem's 143rd Street.
Receiving the Wimbledon trophy from the queen of England, dancing
with the duke, singing at the Wimbledon Ball and receiving the U.S.
Championship trophy from Vice President Richard Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   Today her ailment is not cancer as has been reported, but a
terminal case of life: She suffers from depression and has decided
not to take drugs to help her deal with it. Her husband died in
1995. Close friends have passed on, too, and the world she knew is
rapidly disappearing.
</P>
<P>
   This foundation, designed to pluck more Althea Gibsons from
inner cities, will be her legacy.
</P>
<P>
   Picketing the master's mansion is fine, but at some point a
desirable option would seem to be building a mansion of your own.
It never hurts to go back to fundamentals.

LONG ISLAND SUFFERED NO MAJOR DAMAGE FROM HURRICANE BONNIE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   HICKSVILLE, N.Y. _ The tail end of Hurricane Bonnie sideswiped
Long Island Friday as the storm slowly headed eastward over the
Atlantic Ocean, spinning off some heavy rain and gusts of wind but
causing no major damage.
</P>
<P>
   Beaches, which had already suffered a loss of sand during the
more than a dozen storms that lashed the region so far this year,
easily absorbed the remnants of Bonnie, which grazed the New Jersey
and New York coastlines and whose eye came no closer than 200 miles
south of Montauk Point at the eastern tip of Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the North Shore of Long Island remained sunny throughout
the day, as high tides along the South Shore caused some minor
flooding in low-lying waterfront areas normally inundated by high
tides.
</P>
<P>
   State transportation officials said they were keeping a close
watch on two small bridges at the southern end of the Wantagh
Parkway near Jones Beach. One of the bridges, which crosses Goose
Creek, is 68 years old, and engineers expressed concern that the
overnight high tides and wind-driven waves might undermine its
age-weakened supports.
</P>
<P>
   A second nearby bridge across Sloop Channel was closed earlier
this year because of tidal damage to its supports and was replaced
with a temporary bridge.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're keeping both under a 24-hour watch,'' said Craig
Siracusa, the regional manager of the Transportation Department.
</P>
<P>
   Jones Beach, Robert Moses State Park and Hither Hills State Park
were all closed to swimmers because of 8-foot waves and strong
undercurrents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still are not allowing people in the water,'' said George
Gorman, a spokesman for the state Parks Department. ``We don't want
people being swept into the ocean.'' He said that erosion at the
state beaches had been minimal, then added: ``But we're not going
to breathe a sigh of relief until the storm leaves.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Richard Schaffer, supervisor of the town of Babylon, said that
some of the beaches on Fire Island appeared to be taking a bigger
hit than elsewhere, especially in the area of Gilgo and Tobay
Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 11 or 12 northeasters that blew in here this year took a
sizable chunk,'' Schaffer said. ``We've lost about a million cubic
yards of sand at Gilgo, leaving us only about 25 feet of beach
between the actual shoreline and Ocean Parkway.'' The parkway
bisects that narrow 15-mile-long barrier island.
</P>
<P>
   The passing storm was the first major test for the Long Island
Power Authority as well as for Marketspan, which has signed a
long-term contract to maintain the power authority's electric
system throughout Long Island and parts of Queens.
</P>
<P>
   Burt Cunningham, a spokesman for the power authority, said
shortly before 6 p.m. Friday that the latest weather advisory it
had received from the National Weather Service was ``good news.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Trackers say the storm has taken a turn more toward the
east,'' Cunningham said, ``and the latest indications are it will
pass 200 miles south of Montauk overnight, so it looks as though
the storm is not going to have much of an impact on us. So far,
we've suffered no damage.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted that earlier Friday the Weather Service had predicted
that the center of the storm might pass about 100 miles south of
Montauk Point about 2 a.m. Saturday. He said the utility had gone
to a condition red, or its highest emergency alert, two days ago in
preparation for the hurricane. ``It's been a good exercise for all
of us,'' he said, ``well beyond the experience of a drill.''
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey was spared the brunt of the storm. Although there was
heavy surf along the Atlantic, there was no tidal flooding, and the
Weather Service canceled its tropical storm warning at 5:15 p.m.
Friday.

NEW JERSEY MAN SURRENDERS TO POLICE AFTER FAKING DROWNING 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ A young man accused of faking his drowning on
Monday at Point Pleasant Beach surrendered to the Bergen County
sheriff's office Friday afternoon along with his fiancee, who had
spent six hours feigning distress after reporting that he had been
swept into the Atlantic, the sheriff's office said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said the suspect, Antonio Mandarino Jr., 23, and
his fiancee, Kimberly Kuda, 21, who live together in Oakland, N.J.,
had seen the churning surf caused by Hurricane Bonnie as an
opportunity for him to avoid prosecution on a number of criminal
charges he faced in Bergen County. Ms. Kuda, appearing breathless
and distraught, flagged down an officer about 7:30 p.m. Monday,
prompting a frantic search.
</P>
<P>
   Before he disappeared, Mandarino had been scheduled to appear in
Bergen County Superior Court in Hackensack on Sept. 15 on a charge
of eluding the police. He also faced charges of writing bad checks
in several northern New Jersey towns and charges of aggravated
assault in Leonia.
</P>
<P>
   Now he faces even more charges. After his arrest, detectives
found heroin in the couple's motel room; both have been charged
with drug possession. In addition, the authorities in Ocean County
have charged the couple with conspiracy and making a false public
alarm.
</P>
<P>
   At a hearing Friday in Bergen County Superior Court, Judge
William Meehan revoked Mandarino's bail in the earlier cases and
ordered him held at the Bergen County Jail in Hackensack. Ms. Kuda
is scheduled to be arraigned on Monday.

DESPITE RUMORS, DEFIANT YELTSIN SAYS HE WILL NOT RESIGN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to insert 2 new grafs after 4th graf; also inserts a graf
about IMF Director Camdessus toward end )   (See related: RUSSIA-YELTSIN, RUSSIA-U.S., RUSSIA-U.S.-SUMMIT)  
(mk) 
 By MICHAEL WINES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Boris Yeltsin, reclaiming a bit of his old defiant
nature, insisted on national television Friday night that he would
serve out his term as Russia's president and that, for him,
resignation was impossible.
</P>
<P>
   But rumors and reality alike suggested Friday that his
presidency, if it does last, is rushing toward figurehead status.
</P>
<P>
   In excerpts from a videotaped interview, Yeltsin cast himself as
once again in command of his nation's increasingly desperate
financial situation. He said new instructions given to the Central
Bank and the government ``spelled out in detail what should be
done'' and would be strictly obeyed. And he took pains to portray
the country's new prime minister, Victor Chernomyrdin, as a
subordinate and not a pretender to his throne.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has been given as much power as he is entitled to as a
prime minister in any developed country,'' Yeltsin said. ``This was
given to back up strategic tasks. So, consult the president. All
the rest _ you have a free hand. Take decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   But on Friday Chernomyrdin gave no indication of his plans for
ending the economic crisis. After returning from a quickly arranged
meeting with the International Monetary Fund earlier this week,
Chernomyrdin had signaled on Thursday that he had a program that he
might soon announce.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Friday belonged mostly to the president, who besides
appearing on television also reportedly agreed to give up some
important presidential authority.
</P>
<P>
   But even before he spoke _ slowly, with stilted speech and
almost painful pauses _ his envoy to the powerful Communist bloc in
Russia's lower house of Parliament, the Duma, said Yeltsin had
already agreed to cede key portions of the almost-dictatorial
powers of the Russian presidency.
</P>
<P>
   The president's representative to the Duma, Alexander Kotenkov,
and the Communist Duma speaker, Gennady Seleznyov, said in a news
conference that they had reached broad agreement on a new economic
policy and on changes to the 1993 constitution that is the
foundation of presidential power.
</P>
<P>
   Kotenkov said Yeltsin has agreed to allow the prime minister _
that is, Chernomyrdin _ to name Cabinet ministers and to give the
parliament the right to reject those appointments. Yeltsin also
agreed that Chernomyrdin's government should be given a year's
grace period in which it would be spared political attack by the
president or the Duma, Kotenkov said.
</P>
<P>
   Either concession would mark a general loosening of the reins
that Yeltsin has held in his seven years in power. Any serious
alliance with the Communists, who want to re-nationalize industry,
increase social spending and re-establish control of the economy,
should be anathema to western governments and investors who had
begun to build a market economy here.
</P>
<P>
   None of that is to say that Yeltsin or future presidents would
not remain powerful. The president would, among many other things,
choose the prime minister, set economic and defense policy and
remain the nation's representative to the world.
</P>
<P>
   But a consensus has emerged _ true or not _ that Yeltsin is no
longer in control of his fate, or that of his nation. And there
seems to be growing agreement, even among the country's squabbling
political barons, that Chernomyrdin is just about all that stands
between Mother Russia and the abyss.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin effectively said Friday night that that is baloney. ``It
is impossible to remove me, especially considering my character,''
he said in the interview. ``I will not go anywhere. I will not
resign. I will work as long as the constitution allows. Elections
for a new Parliament will be held in the year 2000, but I will not
take part in them.''
</P>
<P>
   Notwithstanding his denial, speculation continues to mushroom
that Yeltsin is seriously ill and soon will resign _ perhaps next
week, if the Duma confirms Chernomyrdin as prime minister _ and
that his maneuverings on television are aimed mostly at persuading
the Duma to do just that.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't believe his words,'' Leonid Radzikhovsky, political
columnist for the Moscow daily Segodnya, said in an interview after
Friday night's speech. ``More precisely, I think Yeltsin in his
character wants to hang on until the last second, but he's already
not together. And to take the place of Yeltsin, you need
Chernomyrdin.''
</P>
<P>
   The president's wan countenance and his wooden mannerisms do
little to discourage such speculation. Nor do real-life political
events.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, in a meeting with Yeltsin, two of Chernomyrdin's leading
rivals in the next presidential election _ Moscow's mayor, Yuri
Luzhkov, and Yegor Stroyev, the chairman of the upper house of
Parliament _ endorsed Chernomyrdin's accession to power. So did
Alexander Lebed, the charismatic army general who now is governor
in Russia's Siberian region and Luzhkov's principal opponent in the
early handicapping of the next presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   Such unity is unheard of among Russian presidential political
rivals. But one western investor, who refused to be identified,
surmised Friday night that they decided that they and the nation
had little choice. ``Read the history of the Weimar republic,'' he
said. ``I think they should be scared.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether Russia will again endure the sort of hyperinflation that
rent post-World War I Germany is pure speculation, but signs of
economic turmoil are everywhere. Russian stocks sank another 10 per
cent and more, but on such low volume that the decline was almost
meaningless. By one estimate, the value of all corporate stocks on
the Russian stock market has now dropped almost sevenfold this
year, to a paltry $15.9 billion _ roughly that of Caterpillar
Corp., the Peoria, Ill., bulldozer maker.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Michel Camdessus, managing director of the
International Monetary Fund, reiterated at a news conference that
Russia's new government must stick to the austerity plan that was
part of last month's agreement for additional loans. After meeting
with Chernomyrdin in Ukraine this week, Camdessus said Friday that
he supported the acting prime minister's efforts, and that he
believed Chernomyrdin understood ``the validity'' of the fund's
plan.
</P>
<P>
   The ruble briefly traded on electronic markets Friday at a rate
of almost 13 to the dollar _ more than double two weeks ago _ and
in the few street shops that sold dollars, the rate was even
higher. Lines, albeit orderly ones, queued outside many Moscow
banks Friday, and some stores reported panic buying by consumers
who anticipated _ accurately _ that prices were about to skyrocket.
</P>
<P>
   Some Russian stores shut altogether, unable to figure out what
their goods were worth when the ruble's value was proving almost
impossible to accurately measure. Other companies in Moscow
abandoned ruble pricing altogether to value their goods in an
unnamed currency whose value could be measured against the American
dollar. Charles Blitzer, a former World Bank official who now
assesses emerging markets in London for Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP;
Jenrette, said the crucial job of the new Russian government is to
stop the ruble's free-fall.
</P>
<P>
   ''Given their financial position, that's going to mean cutting
demand for dollars, either for luxury goods or with stronger
measures to force repatriation of export earnings,'' he said.
``That's an absolute must in stopping the panic.''
</P>
<P>
   Blitzer said the government cannot dawdle if it is to save
itself, and the nation, from fiscal chaos and the prospect of
shortages and social unrest. ''We're in a situation where, really,
a month is a long time,'' he said.

NEW YORK CITY SCHOOLS TENTATIVELY AGREE TO LET POLICE HELP RUN
SECURITY
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After years of fighting between the Board of
Education and City Hall, schools Chancellor Rudy Crew has
tentatively agreed to give the New York City Police Department
significant control over security at the city's public schools,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The plan would include turning over the recruitment, screening
and training of school security officers to the Police Department,
according to school and City Hall officials. But it would not
involve assigning regular police officers to any more than the 130
schools they already help patrol at the invitation of principals,
school officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Crew had agreed on a
memorandum of understanding. Some details must still be worked out,
and the final plan requires the approval of the Board of Education,
which appeared divided on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Colleen Roche, a spokeswoman for the mayor, said Friday that
Giuliani's and Crew's staffs were continuing to negotiate but hoped
to have a plan for the next board meeting, Sept. 16.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe we are close to an agreement that would improve the
safety of students and staff,'' Crew said through his spokeswoman,
Chiara Coletti. He declined to comment further.
</P>
<P>
   The 3,200 officers of the board's Division of School Safety, who
patrol the more than 1,000 public schools armed only with handcuffs
and the aura of authority, would become employees of the Police
Department but not sworn law enforcement officers, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, first reported Thursday in Newsday, all but abolishes
the Division of School Safety, which has patrolled the schools
since 1969, when 200 guards went on duty. A high-ranking school
administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity,
said the board would effectively retain the Police Department to
run the division, which has a $110 million budget.
</P>
<P>
   The chancellor would set up an oversight committee of board
officials, police personnel and community members to settle
disputes.
</P>
<P>
   The draft memorandum of understanding came about after arduous
negotiations. Giuliani, who has never shied away from criticizing
the division insisted that the police play a greater role in school
security.
</P>
<P>
   Crew sought to maintain schools' academic atmosphere without the
concern that police officers might cause to students. Under the
agreement he would retain ultimate say over where the officers are
deployed and how many are assigned to schools. In gray areas, such
as whether students' horseplay has crossed over into assault, the
final decision over arrests would lie with principals.
</P>
<P>
   The Division of School Safety has been the subject of no fewer
than seven investigations since 1971 by the board, city and outside
auditors, all of which found lapses in training, recruitment and
discipline.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, there have been several incidents in which
safety officers have been arrested on charges of sexually
assaulting students or possessing drugs.
</P>
<P>
   A high-ranking school administration official said there were no
plans to dismiss any of the current safety officers, and it was
uncertain what, if any, retraining they might undergo.

PURDUE RALLIES AROUND TILLER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE IRVINE  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Joe Tiller showed up on the Purdue University
campus last year with a radical idea.
</P>
<P>
   The new football coach wanted an offense with four-receiver
sets. He wanted to pass 40-plus times per game. And while not
abandoning the run, he wanted to establish the passing game first
while trying to make big plays.
</P>
<P>
   This was the style Tiller wanted Purdue to play in the
three-yards-and-a-cloud-dust Big Ten.
</P>
<P>
   What in the name of Woody Hayes was Tiller thinking?
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of folks that were skeptical of whether this
offense could be successful in this environment,'' Tiller admitted
before bringing his team to the Coliseum for Sunday's Pigskin
Classic matchup against USC.
</P>
<P>
   True to his nature, the 55-year-old native of Toledo, Ohio,
didn't listen to the skeptics.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a very unpredictable person,'' Purdue defensive end
Roosevelt Colvin said.
</P>
<P>
   The results were certainly unpredictable. Tiller, who left
Wyoming and the pass-happy Western Athletic Conference after
turning the Cowboys into a winner, led Purdue to a 9-3 record and
its first bowl game since 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Turns out he was a prophet when, during his first day on the
job, he said: ``We're not going to take four years to figure this
out.''
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 22, 1997, a year to the day he accepted the job, Purdue
whipped rival Indiana 56-7 to complete the Boilermakers' best
regular season since quarterback Mark Herrmann led the team to nine
wins in 1979 and eight more in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Now what?
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who followed us last year and enjoyed it expect
things and you just cringe,'' Tiller said. ``They say `Should I
order my Rose Bowl tickets?' And we're not playing UCLA in the
regular season.''
</P>
<P>
   Winning programs, he knows, aren't built overnight. The Cowboys
went 4-6-1 in Tiller's first year at Wyoming and 5-7 in his second
in 1992 but didn't have another losing season.
</P>
<P>
   He left Wyoming after leading the 1996 team to a 10-2 record. In
his last season there, Wyoming was first in the nation in passing
offense (359.2 yards per game) and third in total offense (498.2
ypg). He also coached the top two receiving yardage leaders (Marcus
Harris and Ryan Yarborough) in NCAA Division I history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realize the WAC is not the Big Ten, but there are certain
principles that have proved to be successful no matter what the
talent level is,'' Tiller said.
</P>
<P>
   The talent level was definitely questionable at Purdue. The
Boilermakers had finished above .500 only twice since 1981 (5-4-2
in 1994 and 7-5 in 1984). So Tiller cleaned house.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't tolerate anything,'' Colvin said. ``No matter who
you were, if you messed up you were dismissed. Tiller is no
nonsense and the guys caught on quick.''
</P>
<P>
   It was just a matter of doing things right, Tiller said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came on board not thinking we would have to clean house,
but that's just the way it went,'' he said. ``You set a standard
and expect anyone within the organization to measure up and if they
don't, there are consequences. Many times in competitive athletics,
people have a way of eliminating themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The guys who did stay promptly went out and were beaten 36-22 by
Toledo. But the following week Purdue shocked No. 12 Notre Dame
28-17 to break an 11-game Irish win streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a nothing to lose attitude against Notre Dame,'' Colvin
said. ``It got us rolling. We said, `OK we can do it, we can beat a
national powerhouse.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Purdue won eight of the next 10, losing only to Iowa and Penn
State. They ended the year with a 33-20 victory over Oklahoma State
in the Alamo Bowl and a No. 14 ranking in the final AP poll.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year we had the element of surprise,'' Tiller said. ``The
fact that Purdue was down for a dozen years, players might have
said they had lined up against that guy (from Purdue) for two
years, whipped him and things were going to be the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``The schedule helped _ we did not play Ohio State or Michigan.
We were the least injured team I've been around. There are a lot of
reasons we ended up with that kind of year.''
</P>
<P>
   Record-setting quarterback Billy Dicken and receiver Brian
Alford have graduated. Drew Brees, who has attempted only 43
passes, will replace Dicken. Receiver Isaac Jones is good, but he's
the lone returning starter at that position and the running backs
have almost no experience.
</P>
<P>
   Relying on the defense, which has six returning starters and an
All-American candidate in Colvin, may be required, particularly
early in the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you achieve a certain level of success, even though very
brief, it's human nature to raise the bar,'' Tiller said. ``If we
can win 8-9 games this year, that remains to be seen. We have done
a better job in the offseason to be in a position to be successful.
We certainly like what success we've had, what it's done for
program and players, and hope it can carry over.''

CLINTON TRIBUTE TO CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Following are excerpts from comments President Clinton made
Friday at Union Chapel in Oak Bluff, Mass., at a ceremony on the
35th anniversary of the ``I Have a Dream'' speech by the Rev. Dr.
Martin Luther King Jr.:
</P>
<P>
   The summer of 1963 was a very eventful one for me: the summer I
turned 17. What most people know about it now is the famous picture
of me shaking hands with President Kennedy in July. It was a great
moment. But I think the moment we commemorate today, a moment I
experienced all alone, had a more profound impact on my life.
</P>
<P>
   Most of us who are old enough remember exactly where we were on
Aug. 28, 1963. I was in my living room in Hot Springs, Ark. I
remember the chair I was sitting in. I remember exactly where it
was in the room. I remember exactly the position of the chair when
I sat and watched on national television the great March on
Washington unfold.
</P>
<P>
   I remember weeping uncontrollably during Martin Luther King's
speech. And I remember thinking, when it was over, my country would
never be the same and neither would I.
</P>
<P>
   There are people all across this country who made a more intense
commitment to the idea of racial equality and justice that day than
they had ever made before. And so in very personal ways, all of us
became better and bigger because of the work of those who brought
that great day about. There are millions of people who John Lewis
will never meet who are better and bigger because of what that day
meant.
</P>
<P>
   And the words continue to echo down to the present day, spoken
to us today by children who were not even alive then. And, God
willing, their grandchildren will also be inspired and moved and
become better and bigger because of what happened on that
increasingly distant summer day.
</P>
<P>
   What I'd like to ask you to think about a little today, and to
share with you _ and I'll try to do it without taking my spectacles
out, but I don't write very well and I don't read too well as I get
older _ is what I think this means for us today. I was trying to
think about what John and Dr. King and others did and how they did
it, and how it informs what I do and how I think about other things
today.
</P>
<P>
   And I want to ask, you all need to think about three things. ...
</P>
<P>
   No. 1, Dr. King used to speak about how we were all bound
together in a web of mutuality, which was an elegant way of saying,
whether we like it or not, we're all in this life together. We are
interdependent. Well, what does that mean? Well, let me give you a
specific example: We had some good news today. Incomes in America
went up 5 percent last year. That's a big bump in a year. We have
got the best economy in a generation. That's the good news.
</P>
<P>
   But we are mutually interdependent with people far beyond our
borders. Yesterday, there was some more news that was troubling out
of Russia, some rumor, some fact about the decline in the economy.
Our stock market dropped over 350 points. And in Latin America, our
most fast-growing market for American exports, all the markets went
down even though, as far as we know, most of those countries are
doing everything right. Why? Because we're in a tighter and tighter
and tighter web of mutuality.
</P>
<P>
   Asia has these economic troubles. So even though we have got the
best economy in a generation, our farm exports to Asia are down 30
percent from last year. And we have states in this country where
farmers, the hardest-working people in this country, can't make
their mortgage payments because of things that happened half a
world away they didn't have any direct influence on at all. This
world is being bound together more closely.
</P>
<P>
   So what is the lesson from that? Well, I should go to Russia
because, as John said, anybody can come see you when you're doing
well. I should go there. And we should tell them that if they'll be
strong and do the disciplined, hard things they have to do to
reform their country, their economy, and get through this dark
night, that we'll stick with them. ...
</P>
<P>
   The second thing. Even if you're not a pacifist, whenever
possible, peace and nonviolence is always the right thing to do.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   I remember so vividly in 1994 _ John writes about this in the
book _ I was trying to pass this crime bill, and all of the
opposition to the crime bill that was in the newspapers, all the
intense opposition was coming from the NRA and the others that did
not want us to ban assault weapons, didn't believe that we ought to
have more community policemen walking the streets, and
conservatives who thought we should just punish people more and not
spend more money trying to keep kids out of trouble in the first
place. And it was a huge fight.
</P>
<P>
   And so they came to see me, and he said, ``Well, John Lewis is
not going to vote for this bill.'' And I said, ``Why?'' and they
said, ``Because it increases the number of crimes subject to the
federal death penalty and he's not for it. And he's not in bed with
all those other people, he thinks they're wrong, but he can't vote
for it.'' And I said, ``Well, let him alone. There's no point in
calling him'' because he's lived a lifetime dedicated to an idea
and while I may not be a pacifist, whenever possible, it's always
the right thing to do to try to be peaceable and nonviolent.
</P>
<P>
   What does that mean for today? Well, there's a lot of good news.
It's like the economy: the crime rate's at a 25-year low, juvenile
crime's finally coming down. ...
</P>
<P>
   Half a world away, terrorists trying to hurt Americans blow up
two embassies in Africa, and they killed some of our people, some
of our best people _ of, I might add, very many different racial
and ethnic backgrounds, American citizens, including a
distinguished career African-American diplomat and his son _ but
they also killed almost 300 Africans and wounded 5,000 others.
</P>
<P>
   We see their pictures in the morning paper, two of them who did
that. We were bringing them home. And they look like active,
confident young people. What happened inside them that made them
feel so much hatred toward us that they could justify not only an
act of violence against innocent diplomats and other public
servants, but the collateral consequences to Africans whom they
would never know? They had children, too.
</P>
<P>
   So it is always best to remember that we have to try to work for
peace in the Middle East, for peace in Northern Ireland, for an end
to terrorism, for protections against biological and chemical
weapons being used in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   The night before we took action against the terrorist operations
in Afghanistan and Sudan, I was here on this island up till 2:30 in
the morning trying to make absolutely sure that at that chemical
plant there was no night shift. I believed I had to take the action
I did, but I didn't want some person who was a nobody to me, but
who may have a family to feed and a life to live, and probably had
no earthly idea what else was going on there, to die needlessly. I
learned that, and it's another reason we ought to pay our debt to
the United Nations, because if we can work together, together we
can find more peaceful solutions. Now I didn't learn that when I
became president; I learned it from John Lewis and the civil rights
movement a long time ago.
</P>
<P>
   And the last thing I learned from them on which all these other
things depend, without which we cannot build a world of peace or
one America in an increasingly peaceful world bound together in
this web of mutuality, is that you can't get there unless you're
willing to forgive your enemies.
</P>
<P>
   I never will forget one of the most _ I don't think I have ever
spoken about this in public before _ but one of the most meaningful
personal moments I have had as president was a conversation I had
with Nelson Mandela.
</P>
<P>
   And I said to him _ I said: ``You know, I have read your book,
and I have heard you speak. And you spent time with my wife and
daughter, and you have talked about inviting your jailers to your
inauguration.'' And I said, ``It's very moving.'' And I said:
``You're a shrewd as well as a great man. But come on now, how did
you really do that? You can't make me believe you didn't hate those
people who did that to you for 27 years?''
</P>
<P>
   He said, ``I did hate them for quite a long time. After all,
they abused me physically and emotionally. They separated me from
my wife, and it eventually broke my family up. They kept me from
seeing my children grow up.'' He said, ``For quite a long time, I
hated them.''
</P>
<P>
   And then he said: ``I realized one day, breaking rocks, that
they could take everything away from me, everything, but my mind
and heart. Now, those things I would have to give away, and I
simply decided I would not give them away.''
</P>
<P>
   So as you look around the world, you see _ how do you explain
these three children who were killed in Ireland or all the people
who were killed in the square when the people were told to leave
the City Hall, there was a bomb there, and then they walked out
toward the bomb?
</P>
<P>
   What about all those families in Africa? I don't know. I can't
pick up the telephone and call them and say, ``I am so sorry this
happened.'' How do we find that spirit?
</P>
<P>
   All of you know I'm having to become quite an expert in this
business of asking for forgiveness. And I _ it gets a little easier
the more you do it. And if you have a family, an administration, a
Congress and a whole country to ask, you're going to get a lot of
practice.
</P>
<P>
   But I have to tell that in these last days it has come home to
me again, something I first learned as president, but it wasn't
burned in my bones _ and that is that in order to get it, you have
to be willing to give it. And all of us _ the anger, the
resentment, the bitterness, the desire for recrimination against
people you believe have wronged you _ they harden the heart and
deaden the spirit and lead to self-inflicted wounds.
</P>
<P>
   And so it is important that we are able to forgive those we
believe have wronged us, even as we ask for forgiveness from people
we have wronged. And I heard that first _ first _ in the civil
rights movement. ``Love thy neighbor as thyself.''

STATE EXAMINING HANDLING OF U.S. OPEN TICKETS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By TERRY PRISTIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The state attorney general's office is investigating
allegations that employees in the box office for the U.S. Open
tennis tournament illegally diverted prime seats to scalpers who in
turn resold the tickets at vastly inflated prices, officials said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   An undercover agent recently paid $1,700 for a ticket to a
women's semifinal match that had a face value of $80, said David
Corvette, a spokesman for Attorney General Dennis Vacco. The
two-week tournament begins on Monday in Queens.
</P>
<P>
   New York state law bars the resale of tickets to entertainment
and sports events for more than $5 above face value, or 10 percent
more than face value, whichever is greater, plus tax. The
allegations about the box office employees were made by people with
knowledge about the tournament's operations, Corvette said.
</P>
<P>
   Tournament officials acknowledged Friday that ticket scalping is
a widespread problem for the U.S. Open and for most other popular
sports events. But they said they doubted that people working in
the box office of the National Tennis Center in Flushing
Meadows-Corona Park, where the tournament is held, were to blame.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that we don't have anyone dishonest in the box
office,'' said Jay Snyder, the tournament's director.
</P>
<P>
   David Meehan, the director of operations for the tennis center,
said the scalped tickets probably originated with longtime
boxholders, who pay as much as $26,000 for 150 tickets and may be
tempted to resell some of them to defray their costs. ``We think
the real root of the problem are the people who have subscribed for
many years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Corvette said the investigators suspect that box office
employees accepted bribes in exchange for the tickets because the
seats were always in the best locations. ``In a lot of cases, the
seats that these brokers are selling are the seats that were
withheld from sale to the public,'' he said. Most theaters and
sports arenas reserve a block of seats, known as house seats, for
dignitaries and friends and associates of the people involved in
the event.
</P>
<P>
   Meehan, however, said that only two box office employees have
access to house seats, which can be sold only to people who are
exchanging other tickets that they have previously bought.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation of the U.S. Open is part of a wider
examination of ticket scalping in the entertainment and sports
industry that Vacco, a Republican who is seeking re-election this
year, is conducting.
</P>
<P>
   The tennis tournament became a focus of concern because of a
case involving a Manhattan couple who were convicted on Aug. 13 of
selling thousands of tickets for concerts and sports events at
inflated prices. During an August 1996 raid at the home of the
couple, Gerard Nahay and his wife, Janet Rosenblatt, agents seized
more than 1,000 tickets to the Open and hundreds of tickets to
Mets, Yankees and Jets games.
</P>
<P>
   Nahay and Ms. Rosenblatt, co-owners of Tickets on Request, 424
W. 33rd St., were convicted of 19 counts of ticket scalping and tax
evasion. They are scheduled to be sentenced in state Supreme Court
in Manhattan on Sept. 23 and face a maximum of four years in
prison. The company's telephone number is no longer listed, and it
could not be determined whether it remains in business.
</P>
<P>
   In February, the tennis center was fined $40,000 for failing to
comply with a rarely enforced 1965 law that requires ticket sellers
to register with the state. Under the law, the state has to be
notified when a ticket seller changes jobs, Corvette said.
</P>
<P>
   Ticket sellers who accept illegal payment from brokers _ known
as ``ice'' _ are subject to suspension or cancellation of the
registration.
</P>
<P>
   Corvette said he did not know how many ticket sellers at the
tennis center might have engaged in illegal business dealings with
scalpers.

FAMILY REUNITES WITH HORSE USED IN ALLEGED CHARITY SCHEME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Will also move in the ``n'' California news file.) 
BY BROOKE OLSON  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Nine-year-old Audrey approached the horse
cautiously, extending a hand to the bony, white Arabian she once
owned.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's yours princess. Hug her like you used to _ she's not
hurting,'' Cathy Becker-Skaggs told her daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Audrey burst into tears moments later, distraught over the
condition of Libertee. The Becker-Skaggs rescued the horse from an
abusive home and then about a year ago donated Libertee to what the
family thought was a day camp for needy children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sad because she's been through a lot,'' Audrey said. ``I
can't wait until she comes home and I can brush her and feed her
and love her again.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a bittersweet reunion for the Becker-Skaggs and the horse
Friday afternoon at the West Valley animal shelter in the L.A.
suburb of Chatsworth. The family was one of a dozen who allegedly
were swindled by a woman's promises to care for their aging
animals.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities allege that Renae Ferguson, a 28-year-old Tarzana
woman, starved and neglected the horses that were donated to her
West Coast Riding Center. The camp didn't exist, and Ferguson is
suspected of selling the donated animals, often by placing
classified ads in the same publications she used to solicit
donations, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen horses were confiscated from Ferguson, but police said
they have received more than 100 phone calls from people who think
they may have been tricked by the horse dealer.
</P>
<P>
   If the allegations prove true, it will be the second time
Libertee, also known as Libby, has endured abuse. Cathy
Becker-Skaggs had rescued the 23-year-old animal from a woman who
had abused and neglected her. Nine months and $2,000 later, the
horse was back in good shape. Then, the family began looking for a
good home for Libertee and, on a friend's recommendation, donated
the animal to Ferguson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just really wanted the best for her,'' Becker-Skaggs said.
``I had no idea this would happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Becker-Skaggs stroked the horse lovingly, pressing her face
close to the mane of the animal. ``She's a very strong horse. As
much abuse as she's been through, she should be very mean-spirited
by now,'' she said. ``But she's so sweet and so very forgiving.''
</P>
<P>
   The family had donated the horse a year ago and had not heard
anything of their beloved former pet until Thursday morning when
Becker-Skaggs picked up the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw the story and I just couldn't believe it,'' she said,
unsure at that time if Libertee was among those abused. It wasn't
until later Thursday afternoon when, with the help of television
news crews who were filming the horses, that she was able to
identify Libertee.
</P>
<P>
   ``The crew came over and showed me the photos and I was pretty
sure it was Libby,'' Becker-Skaggs said. The black-and-white video
showed a Libby trademark _ a scar across the right flank that the
horse got when she was first abused.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Libby came to us, she had bed sores on her body and they
were horribly infected,'' Becker-Skaggs said, running her hands
across the scar. ``Libby even underwent a couple of surgeries to
fix it ... but she was left with this scar.''
</P>
<P>
   Becker-Skaggs said she did not harbor any ill will toward the
woman accused of starving Libertee. In fact, she said she prays
that the woman will find the right path.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, she'll be able to grow from this experience and
learn to love animals again,'' Becker-Skaggs said.
</P>
<P>
   The Becker-Skaggs family will take Libertee home after the
district attorney wraps up the case against Ferguson. For now,
though, the family is just glad she's in good hands at the city's
animal shelter in Chatsworth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Libertee is going to get the care she needs here and that's
all that matters,'' Becker-Skaggs said. ``And when we take her
home, she'll be the most loved animal ever.'' &QL;

 &HT;    More victims likely as Del Rio clears debris
 &HT;    By Ralph K.M. Haurwitz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The death toll from flooding in Del Rio is
almost certain to rise as workers search through mud and debris
left by the worst storm in the Southwest Texas border town since
1954, officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Some victims might never be found.
</P>
<P>
   Seven fatalities have been confirmed. Authorities have not been
able to account for 187 other people. The vast majority are thought
to be alive, but nine of them are known to have been in Del Rio
when torrential rains fell Sunday night and Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I consider myself an optimist,'' said Sparky Dean, a spokesman
for the Texas Department of Public Safety. ``But I just can't
believe, with the severity of this, that we would only have seven
fatalities.''
</P>
<P>
   Dean said he spoke with one elderly man whose wife was ripped
from his grasp when floodwaters spawned by Tropical Storm Charley
swept through their house. ``He could hear her hollering as she was
washed downstream,'' Dean said. ``His wife is one of the nine
confirmed missing.''
</P>
<P>
   The number of unaccounted-for people has fluctuated widely. That
is because names are added to the list as calls are received from
relatives inquiring about Del Rio residents. Ninety-seven other
people previously listed as unaccounted for have been found, Dean
said.
</P>
<P>
   Public and private organizations were stepping up relief efforts
Friday in Del Rio, a town of 34,000 people on the Rio Grande. Heavy
equipment was brought in to dredge San Felipe Creek, along which
most of the damage occurred. The Salvation Army arranged to assist
flood survivors not only in Del Rio but across the river in the
Mexican community of Ciudad Acun(tilde)a.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Land Commissioner Garry Mauro, responding to a request
from local officials, sent a mobile communications unit to Del Rio
to help work crews and law officers. The unit, normally used at oil
spills, has computer, telephone and radio capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Emergency Management Agency was preparing to acquire
mobile homes and other temporary housing. A total of 1,562 homes
and businesses were damaged in Del Rio, according to the Department
of Public Safety. That includes 625 that were destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Housing ``is going to be the major issue'' along the Rio Grande,
said FEMA Director James Lee Witt. The agency's director of human
services, Laurence W. Zensinger, was scheduled to arrive in Del Rio
today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Funds will start to flow over the weekend,'' Zensinger said.
</P>
<P>
   That would be none too soon for Gemma Garza. She and her family
spent the day carting belongings out of her parents' damaged house.
Her own home just down the block was also damaged. Neither she nor
her parents have insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a brand-new bedroom set,'' Garza said, pointing to a
smashed dresser on the curb. ``I hadn't even made the first
payment.''
</P>
<P>
   State Attorney General Dan Morales warned that he would use the
deceptive-trade law to prosecute price-gougers, dishonest
remodelers and anyone else who attempts to take advantage of flood
victims.
</P>
<P>
   Relief seemed to be arriving more slowly in Rio Bravo, a poor
community south of Laredo. Rio Bravo's mayor issued an open letter
seeking assistance for about two dozen families left homeless after
floodwaters invaded their modest mobile homes and wood-frame
houses. The flood wave on the Rio Grande was working its way
downstream from Laredo to Falcon Reservoir. Falcon had risen 6.7
feet by Friday and was expected to rise an additional 5.3 feet by
Monday. Amistad Reservoir, upstream from Del Rio, has risen 14 feet
from flooding in the Devils and Pecos rivers.
</P>
<P>
   Falcon and Amistad are expected to reach 29 percent of their
combined capacity, far below what is needed to break a five-year
drought in the Lower Rio Grande Valley, said Ken Rakestraw, chief
of water accounting for the International Boundary and Water
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The flooding in Del Rio was the worst since June 28, 1954, said
Daryl Williams, a forecaster with the National Weather Service.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the seven fatalities in Del Rio, five people were swept
away by floodwaters in Ciudad Acun(tilde)a, and four people died
when their pickup was swept down a stream in Real County on Sunday.
One man died Sunday of a heart attack during an evacuation from
rising waters at Garner State Park in Uvalde County.

YANKEES BEAT SEATTLE, 10-3, FOR 3RD STRAIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Yankees drifted off their 120-victory course this
week after their rudder _ the starting pitching _ took on some
dents and three different relief pitchers blew save opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   But Friday night, the Yankees got a strong outing from Orlando
Hernandez, the first from a starter in a week, as they overwhelmed
the Seattle Mariners, 10-3, before 47,785 fans at Yankee Stadium.
The Yankees, having won three straight games and on pace to win
118, seemed to have navigated their way through the season's first
squall.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees are three victories from reaching 100, a milestone
the 1906 Chicago Cubs and the 1954 Cleveland Indians reached on
Sept. 9, the earliest in the 20th century, according to the Elias
Sports Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Since David Wells shut out Texas last Friday, the Yankee machine
had endured a few glitches: David Cone had struggled through two
outings, the Rangers had pummeled Hernandez, Andy Pettitte had
fallen apart in the seventh inning against Anaheim, and Hideki
Irabu had disintegrated after five innings. Ryan Bradley, a rookie,
had to start Wednesday after Ramiro Mendoza underwent a minor bit
of surgery. The starters were faltering and the bullpen was spent
and reeling.
</P>
<P>
   But as he has several times this season, Hernandez
re-established equilibrium, allowing just three hits and two runs
over seven innings, striking out eight and walking two Friday
night. He lacked control in the first inning of his last start,
against the Rangers, but against the Mariners, his control was
superb.
</P>
<P>
   Pitching coaches generally will be pleased if their students can
throw first-pitch strikes to two-thirds of opposing hitters;
Hernandez threw first-pitch strikes to the first eight Seattle
batters Friday night, and 11 of the first 12.
</P>
<P>
   By getting ahead in the count, of course, Hernandez then forced
the Mariners to swing defensively at his sidearm slider and
curveball and assorted variety of off-speed stuff. He struck out
Alex Rodriguez, Ken Griffey Jr. and David Segui in the first
inning, and got Segui again in the third. After Rodriguez swung
through a fastball to strike out in the fifth, he turned and
slammed his bat against the plate, in utter disgust.
</P>
<P>
   Run support was not a concern for Hernandez, who improved his
record to 9-4.
</P>
<P>
   Over five games in four days this week, the Anaheim Angels
demonstrated they have the hubris to challenge the Yankees in the
postseason, and there's nothing the Yankees can do to change that
between now and when the leaves turn.
</P>
<P>
   What the Yankees can accomplish in the last 30 days of the
regular season is address their own weaknesses (right-handed middle
relief, first and foremost), surpass records and re-establish their
dominance over the rest of the American League. They took long
strides to those ends Friday night, beating on Seattle as Evander
Holyfield might a sparring partner.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Spoljaric, the Mariners' starting pitcher, could have used
some protective gear, as hard as he was hit. Chuck Knoblauch drove
Spoljaric's second pitch into the right field corner for the first
of his four hits, then scampered around first base and challenged
the arm of Raul Ibanez, sliding safely into second with a double.
</P>
<P>
   After Tim Raines walked and Bernie Williams singled through the
middle, Chili Davis crushed a double between the right and center
fielders and just like that, the Yankees led 3-0 and everything
seemed back to 1998 standards.
</P>
<P>
   But there was more: Jorge Posada pulled a double down the third
base line and into the left field corner, Davis scoring. If there
was any apprehension or worry remaining from the Anaheim series, it
was gone, like a migraine headache. The crowd jeered Stan Williams,
the Seattle pitching coach, as he went to and from the mound, in a
mission to calm Spoljaric.
</P>
<P>
   Chad Curtis walked, and Segui, the first baseman, and John
Marzano, the catcher, visited Spoljaric. Luis Sojo pulled a ground
single through the left side, scoring Posada, and Alex Rodriguez,
the shortstop, and Marzano talked to Spoljaric, who was quickly
running out of counseling options.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankee rally finally ended on Spoljaric's 43rd pitch of the
inning, after five hits, seven baserunners and five runs. The
Mariners might have Rodriguez and Griffey, but the Yankees were
giving them the same treatment extended to the Kansas City Royals.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees added two runs in the third inning, when Scott
Brosius blasted a two-run homer into the third deck above left
field, and three more runs in the fourth inning, Raines slapping a
two-run single. In all, Spoljaric (4-3) was charged with nine runs,
and when he was removed, some Yankee fans behind the Seattle dugout
stood and cheered and thanked him in their own special way for
helping to restore order in the Yankees' special world.

E-MAIL HOAX TOUTS DISNEY TRIP  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KATHLEEN INGLEY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The e-mail message seems too Goofy to be true: Get a free trip
to the Magic Kingdom just by clicking a button.
</P>
<P>
   Computer users across the nation are receiving that enticing
promise, supposedly a reward for helping the Walt Disney Co. check
out a new computer program.
</P>
<P>
   The catch? The offer is as phony as the ears on a Mousketeer's
hat.
</P>
<P>
   ``A fraud,'' said Disney spokesman Ken Green, sounding a bit
Grumpy about the whole affair.
</P>
<P>
   And it's the latest in a series of e-mail hoaxes that are
spreading like wildfire, thanks to the ease of electronic mail. The
technological tall tales range from fake warnings about
non-existent viruses to bogus appeals to protect public radio.
</P>
<P>
   The Disney hoax popped up this month. The e-mail, supposedly
from Walt Disney Jr., explains that the company is working with
computer giant Microsoft and needs help testing an e-mail tracing
program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forward this to everyone you know,'' the message instructs,
``and if it reaches 13,000 people, 1,300 of the people on the list
will receive $5,000, and the rest will receive a free trip for two
to Disney World.''
</P>
<P>
   The entire offer is no more real than Mickey Mouse, and even the
author is make-believe. Walt Disney never had a son, Green said.
</P>
<P>
   But computer users, from business owners to Ph.D.s, want to
believe, and they're forwarding the e-mail by the thousands.
</P>
<P>
   Why?
</P>
<P>
   Their forwarding messages give a hint: ``Can't hurt to do it,
anyway.'' ```Who knows? Stranger things have happened.'' ``Why
not?''
</P>
<P>
   As Adam Sohn, spokesman for Microsoft, observes, ``There's no
consequence for sending it along. Some send it tongue in cheek,
some because they believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   Just by their volume, however, these e-mails aren't as harmless
as they seem, according to the U.S. Department of Energy's Web site
that monitors hoaxes and chain letters.
</P>
<P>
   If each one of the recipients sends the message to just 10 other
people, the ninth round of messages will add up to 1 billion. That
could interfere with legitimate e-mails, plus there's the time lost
to reading and deleting such chain letters.
</P>
<P>
   The Disney message is a new twist on an e-mail hoax that started
last year. The earlier version, purportedly from Microsoft Chairman
Bill Gates, offered $1,000 for forwarding messages to help in an
e-mail tracking project.
</P>
<P>
   But the payoff isn't even technologically possible, Sohn said,
because there's no way to track all the various e-mail providers to
find out where messages were forwarded.
</P>
<P>
   It's also virtually impossible to figure out where a hoax
started. The only way to track down the culprit is through a copy
of the original e-mail, which gets lost in the blizzard of
forwarding.
</P>
<P>
   Sohn has three theories for what motivates people to launch
hoaxes:
</P>
<P>
   Collecting e-mail addresses for future junk mailings, although
this is possible only if a return message is requested.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to clog up the system in general or for some target
company, such as Microsoft. This is rarely a problem, because most
e-mail servers have such large capacities.
</P>
<P>
   Getting some personal, if anonymous, glory if the hoax is
publicized.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet offers an incredible amount of freedom &UR; to search
out information and find people with similar interests and
products,'' he said. ``It's unfortunate that some folks have chosen
to abuse that freedom, but in some respects you have to take the
good with the bad.''
</P>
<P>
   His advice on dealing with hoaxes: Hit the delete button. &QL;

FROM THE SIDE, TESSMER HAS IMPRESSIVE DEBUT 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Jay Tessmer tried throwing a baseball overhand, but
it felt weird, like slipping your left foot into a right shoe, or
like a left-handed person brushing his teeth with his right hand.
He decided to throw the way he felt most comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   And though Tessmer's sidearm delivery produces fastballs with
velocity comparable with other pitchers' changeups, he made it to
the big leagues because of his unusual motion.
</P>
<P>
   In his major-league debut Thursday night, Tessmer, 26,
contributed a perfect inning of relief _ two strikeouts and an easy
flyout _ and collected his first victory when the Yankees scored in
the bottom of the 11th inning to beat Anaheim, 6-5.
</P>
<P>
   For a pitching staff in need of stabilization, Tessmer's outing
came at the right time. ``He used one baseball for three outs,''
said Joe Torre, the Yankees' manager. ``That's impressive.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Yankees attempt to sort out their right-handed relief
problems before the start of the American League playoffs on Sept.
29, Tessmer will be among those thrown against the proverbial wall;
if he gets outs, he will stick. If he does not, he will join the
growing number of Yankee relievers who have tried and failed to
hold a job.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is, if you keep putting up the numbers, you're
going to be given the opportunity,'' said Brian Cashman, the
Yankees' general manager.
</P>
<P>
   Tessmer has survived and thrived under those conditions in his
career, after being drafted in the 19th round in 1995, out of the
University of Miami. Like knuckleballers, soft-throwing sidearmers
are looked upon as if their pitches are freakish, and teams are
rarely patient with them.
</P>
<P>
   Tessmer's sinking fastball reaches a maximum speed of 85 miles
an hour _ pedestrian, by Kerry Wood standards _ and, in fact,
Tessmer would rather throw it 80 to 82 mph, he said, because it
tends to sink more.
</P>
<P>
   ``The harder I throw,'' Tessmer said, ``the more the ball tends
to flatten out.''
</P>
<P>
   Tessmer also throws a changeup, along with a curveball that
breaks inside on left-handed hitters. But it is the movement of his
pitches and his ability to change speeds and throw all of his
pitches for strikes that pushed him through the minors.
</P>
<P>
   Tessmer had 55 saves in his first two seasons, but in 1997, he
accumulated a 5.31 earned run average for Class AA Norwich. During
the off season, Tessmer watched videotape of Dan Quisenberry,
perhaps the most memorable sidearmer in recent history, with the
Yankees pitching instructor Billy Connors, and between them they
tried to figure out a way to get more movement on Tessmer's
pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Tessmer made a slight adjustment, opening his delivery more
quickly and allowing his right arm to drag more. He enjoyed an
exceptional minor league season. In Class AA and AAA, his ERA was
0.93 in 57 appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Facing the Angels on Thursday, he struck out Phil Nevin and
Darrin Erstad. His fastball darted down and away from the
left-handed hitting Erstad, and afterward he got the game ball, as
well as the ball Bernie Williams drove for the game-winning,
two-run double.
</P>
<P>
   Opposing hitters, especially left-handed batters, sometimes
feast on sidearmers, but Torre will continue to use Tessmer, until
he does something to fall out of favor, the same parameters in
which Todd Erdos, Joe Borowski, Mike Buddie and Ryan Bradley have
worked under this year.
</P>
<P>
   Darryl Strawberry said of Tessmer, ``He could turn out to be an
important guy for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees remain hopeful that Jeff Nelson will recover from
back trouble and reclaim his role as the right-handed setup man.
Nelson and Darren Holmes both threw in Tampa, Fla., Friday, and if
all goes well, they will pitch in a minor league rehabilitation
game Monday and then again two days later, before being activated
by the Yankees. Nelson had already reached that point before in his
rehabilitation, before his back trouble flared.
</P>
<P>
   Prospect's Parents Killed
</P>
<P>
   The parents of the top Yankees prospect Jackson Melian were
killed in a car accident on Interstate 77 early Friday morning,
shortly after watching their son play in a game for Class AA
Greensboro (N.C). Vicente and Jasmine Melian were driving from
Columbia, S.C., where Greensboro played, to Hickory, N.C., ahead of
the team bus.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Yankees' game against Seattle at Yankee Stadium
Friday night, a moment of silence was observed for the outfielder's
parents.
</P>
<P>
   Yankees General Manager Brian Cashman said, ``We'll give him the
support and the prayers he needs.''
</P>
<P>
   According to John Frey, general manager for the Greensboro team,
Melian learned of his parents' deaths when the team bus came upon
the accident. Melian is in Charlotte, N.C., away from the team and
tending to his family, Frey said. Melian's older brother survived
the accident, Frey said.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson Melian, who was born in Venezuela, signed with the
Yankees at age 16 for $1.6 million in 1996, the most money, at that
time, for a teen-age prospect from outside the United States.
Vicente Melian had an affinity for the Yankees, naming his son
after the Hall of Fame slugger Reggie Jackson.

ATP CLARIFIES POSITION ON ANDROSTENEDIONE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   COMMACK, N.Y. _ The men's tennis tour clarified its stand on the
testosterone-producing substance androstenedione Friday, saying
that it had been previously banned by the ATP and that players are
not being given a grace period to test positive for it.
</P>
<P>
   A story in Friday's New York Times quoted Bill Norris, a medical
trainer for the ATP, as saying that the men's tour had decided on
Wednesday to ban use of the substance and that there would be a
grace period for testing. Norris said that David Cooper, the tour's
executive vice president in charge of rules and regulations, was
involved in the decision.
</P>
<P>
   The ATP said, however, that androstenedione, an over-the-counter
supplement now in the spotlight because of its use by the St. Louis
Cardinal slugger Mark McGwire, was already on the banned list,
although not by name. Dr. Brian Hainline, the chief medical officer
at the U.S. Open and an advisory board member for the sport's
anti-drug program, said androstenedione fell under the ATP's ban on
``related substances,'' which includes any drug that theoretically
raises testosterone levels.
</P>
<P>
   Graeme Agars, a spokesman for the ATP, said that at a regularly
scheduled meeting of the tour's players on Monday, the first day of
the Open, it was quite likely androstenedione would be discussed.
Agars said the ATP accepted responsibility for the initial
misstatement.

TAPE OF PHONE TALK ERASED IN MOLESTATION CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By RONALD SMOTHERS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ One of several tapes of telephone conversations
from a sting operation against a man accused of molesting a
15-year-old Jackson Township boy was accidentally erased by a
technician who was trying to make copies, the Monmouth County
prosecutor said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The slip-up has taken on greater significance largely because
the teen-ager, Samuel Manzie, angrily stopped cooperating in the
sting and was charged less than a week later with the rape and
strangulation murder of Edward Werner, 11, who was selling candy
door-to-door for a school fund-raiser. The Sept. 27, 1997, slaying
sparked parents' deepest fears and led to an effort in the
Legislature to ban such school fund-raising efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor, John Kaye, said that the lost tape was the last
of three that his office's investigators had made of a series of
telephone conversations between Samuel Manzie and Stephen Simmons
in September 1997. Simmons, 44, a convicted pedophile from
Holbrook, N.Y., has been charged with luring Samuel, then 14, into
four sexual encounters, including at least one in Monmouth County,
in late 1996 after the two met in an online chat room.
</P>
<P>
   Simmons, his lawyer and others involved in the case have known
about the loss of the tape since January, according to Kaye. He
said that its loss, while unfortunate, had not seriously hurt the
prosecution's case against Simmons. For one thing, he noted, in
November a grand jury found sufficient evidence to indict Simmons
based on information in the other two tapes and in the written
recollections of investigators as to what was on the third tape.
</P>
<P>
   Simmons, in a letter sent to The Asbury Park Press earlier this
week, questioned whether the erasure was an accident. The paper
published an article about the letter and the prosecutor's response
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Simmons' lawyer, Howard Golden, said that the prosecutor's
account of the entire taping episode was ``ambiguous.'' He said he
had been unsuccessful in getting clarification from the
prosecutor's office about what had happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``My client believes that the tape would have been helpful to
his defense, and he disagrees very strongly with police accounts of
what it contained,'' Golden said. ``I can't say that there are
actual denials of the charges in the indictment, but there is a
question of the validity of any case against Simmons because
evidence was destroyed.''
</P>
<P>
   Simmons is being held in the Monmouth County Jail in Freehold
and Kaye said that his trial would not take place until the murder
case against Samuel in adjacent Ocean County was concluded. Samuel
is charged with trying to sodomize and then strangling Edward, the
sixth-grader who rang his doorbell to sell candy for his school.
Samuel, according to police, hid the body in a suitcase in his
house before dumping it in nearby woods.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel had agreed to help investigators build a criminal case
against the man who had enticed him into a sexual affair. But on
Sept. 22, after nearly a month of cooperation, he rebelled against
the investigation, tipped off Simmons and smashed the recording
device. Over the next few days, his parents unsuccessfully tried to
have him committed for long-term psychiatric care.
</P>
<P>
   Kaye said that the Sept. 22 conversation was the one
inadvertently erased. The erasure apparently happened shortly after
the conversation was recorded. A technician using the office's new
high-speed dubbing machine, which can make three copies at once,
placed the master tape in one of the copy slots by mistake and a
blank tape in the slot where the master should have been, Kaye
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we made three recordings,'' Kaye said, ``and the first
contained the evidence crucial to the case and the second was a
tape of our attempt to have Sam lure him to New Jersey so we could
arrest him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We explained what happened to the tape to the grand jury and
provided them with copies of the recollections and the notes of the
officers who were there.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the things about the account of the accident that were
ambiguous, Golden said, was Kaye's assertion that three separate
conversations were taped. Golden said records from the pretrial
discovery phase indicated that only two conversations were
originally taped. He said that Simmons' handwritten, nine-page
letter about the erasures sent to The Asbury Park Press had brought
out more information than he had been able to get from the
prosecutors.

A LIVING HISTORY OF AMERICAN JUDAISM 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also NY-SYNAGOGUE-FIRE) 
(js) 
 By SUSAN SACHS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Within the soaring sandstone building, with its
ornately stenciled blue and gold walls and Moorish arches, the
famous and the destitute worshipped for 126 years, marked the great
moments of the Reform movement, and heard some of American
Judaism's grandest orators eulogize both the meek and the mighty.
</P>
<P>
   But as the Central Synagogue burned Friday, Ronald Goldberger
recalled the small personal moments he had shared there with his
family: the naming of his children, their bar mitzvahs, the service
when his wife blew the shofar, or ram's horn, to signal the arrival
of the Jewish New Year.
</P>
<P>
   And then Goldberger, who said he has been a member for more than
20 years, wept. ``That's my synagogue that's burning up,'' he said
hoarsely, as a friend embraced him in the pall of smoke.
</P>
<P>
   The Central Synagogue, believed to be the oldest continuously
used Jewish house of worship in New York, was built between 1870
and 1872. Its cornerstone was laid by the founder of Reform Judaism
in the United States, Rabbi Isaac Mayer Wise.
</P>
<P>
   Built as a fifth synagogue for the Ahawath Chesed congregation,
which was formed in 1846 by Bohemian Jews, the building was
designed by Henry Fernbach, one of the first Jews to make a name
for himself in U.S. architecture.
</P>
<P>
   At the time it was built, American Jews were casting about for a
style that could represent both their sense of modernism and their
desire to root themselves in a rich past, said Cissy Grossman, a
member of the congregation and the author of a 1989 book about the
synagogue called ``The Jewish Family's Book of Days.''
</P>
<P>
   The search expressed itself in a revival of Spanish, Moorish and
Egyptian style and, in the Central Synagogue, in a profusion of
arches and lacy arabesque designs carved into the woodwork.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the whole idea of finding a stylistic thing that has
the feeling of being Jewish and also refers to the fact that Jews
lived in the Islamic world for so long and had a peaceful
existence,'' Ms. Grossman said.
</P>
<P>
   The effect, from the inside, was unforgettable.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Alexander Schindler, president emeritus of the Union of
American Hebrew Congregations, the umbrella organization of Reform
temples, said Friday night: ``I come from Nazi Germany, so I don't
tie myself to a building. But this one hit me that way. The
architecture was awe-inspiring. It's a place that made the spirit
soar.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the congregation undertook several major
renovations. Yet another repair project was under way to restore
the original painted designs on the interior walls, some of which
had been painted over. That dedication to maintaining the glory of
the synagogue and uncovering its original splendors apparently has
saved many of its treasures.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ms. Goldman, who oversees the synagogue's extensive collection
of Judaica, said most of the precious historical objects, many
Torah scrolls and even the original architectural plans from the
19th century had already been moved to warehouses over the last few
months. So had much of the congregation's archive of wedding and
birth records, letters, cemetery maps and other documents.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the fire, records of what the synagogue looked like and
how it was built survive. ``There are many restorers in New York
who know that building very well,'' Ms. Goldman said. ``Every
aspect of it has been photographed and many people have worked on
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The fate of two of the synagogue's most beloved treasures,
vestiges of the lost Jewry of Eastern Europe, was still unknown.
</P>
<P>
   One is a grand bronze Hanukkah lamp from the 18th century that
was donated by some of the original members of the congregation.
The other is a recovered and restored fragment of a Torah scroll
that had been confiscated by the Nazis from one of the countless
synagogues destroyed, along with their members, in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they are not able to rescue it,'' Rabbi Schindler said,
``it will burn twice.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, at a ceremony marking the 100th anniversary of the
dedication of the Central Synagogue, Rabbi Schindler recalled the
simple people _ the shopkeepers and tailors of the lower East Side
_ who pooled their money to buy the land at 55th Street and
Lexington Avenue where they would eventually build their temple.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can imagine the trepidation that filled their hearts as
they stood here that morning,'' Rabbi Schindler said then. ``We can
imagine the doubts they knew and the fears they had. But they
conquered these fears and doubts and gave strength to their
children and their children's children and to us.''
