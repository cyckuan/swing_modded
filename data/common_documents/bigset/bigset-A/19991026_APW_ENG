<HEADLINE> Brewers Release Pitcher Hideo Nomo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Hideo Nomo, the Japanese right-hander who  
rejuvenated his career after signing a minor league contract with 
the Milwaukee Brewers, has been released, as provided under terms 
of the deal, general manager Dean Taylor said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 31-year-old Nomo, who becomes a free agent, gave the Brewers  
pitching staff a welcome shot in the arm, winning six of his first 
seven decisions and nine of his first 11. He finished 12-8 with a 
4.54 ERA in 28 starts. 
</P>
<P>
	The Brewers took a chance on Nomo in late April, after he was  
released by the Chicago Cubs. He had been waived earlier by the New 
York Mets. 
</P>
<P>
	Nomo, a former NL rookie of the year, pitched the four previous  
seasons with the Los Angeles Dodgers and the Mets. 
</P>
<P>
	His career record in the major leagues is 61-49.

	Learjet Crash Scene Probed  
</P>
<P>
	MINA, S.D. (AP) -- Trying to find out if a sudden loss of cabin  
pressure caused the Learjet crash that killed golfer Payne Stewart 
and five others, federal investigators are digging for clues in a 
10-foot crater in a South Dakota pasture. A National Transportation 
Safety Board team took samples of victims' remains but cautioned 
there would likely be no quick explanation why the plane flew 
pilotless for 1,400 miles across the country. The cockpit voice 
recorder hasn't been found, NTSB Vice Chairman Robert Francis said. 
Francis stressed that a sudden decompression of the aircraft is 
still just one possible theory.

	Albright Urges Russia To Pull Back  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States and the Netherlands joined  
today in urging Russia to pull back its forces from Chechnya, where 
they are pounding the capital, Grozny, with artillery. But 
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has acknowledged that her 
appeals to Russia have not been heeded as Russian infantry and 
tanks battled with Chechen forces on the edge of the city. ``We 
urge Russia not to repeat the mistakes of the past in Chechnya, and 
instead to open a dialogue toward a peaceful resolution with 
legitimate Chechen partners,'' Albright said.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Army is sending an investigative team to  
South Korea to begin the field inquiry into allegations of a Korean 
War massacre of civilians by U.S. soldiers. The investigators, 
headed by the Army's inspector general, Lt. Gen. Michael Ackerman, 
plan one day of talks with their South Korean counterparts on 
Friday, defense officials said. On Sept. 30, The Associated Press 
reported accounts by American veterans and South Korean villagers

	LARAMIE, Wyo. (AP) -- A coroner testified today that a gay  
student who was beaten to death in October 1998 was struck at least 
20 times and that his skull was fractured a half-dozen times. The 
coroner said Matthew Shepard died as a result of the blunt trauma 
injuries. Aaron McKinney is on trial and accused in the killing. 
His attorney says a combination of drugs, alcohol and past sexual 
traumas sparked McKinney to fly into a rage when Shepard made a 
pass at him. Another man, Russell Henderson, pleaded guilty in 
April in connection with the slaying and got two life terms.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Forecasters say the weather phenomenon called  
La Nina will change the strength and pattern of the Pacific jet 
stream over North America, resulting in a warm and dry winter in 
the southern half of the nation but more snow and rain in the 
Pacific Northwest and Great Lakes. La Nina is a periodic cooling of 
a large area of the tropical Pacific Ocean. It can alternate with 
an ocean warming called El Nino. Both can have impacts on weather 
worldwide.

<HEADLINE> Badgers Support Dayne for Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MADISON, Wis. (AP) -- If you got off the Dayne Train, don't  
bother trying to get back on. 
</P>
<P>
	When Ron Dayne's quest for the national rushing record appeared  
to be failing, he began receiving national criticism. Wisconsin 
players and coaches rallied around Dayne, saying he was the victim 
of overhyped expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	Now that Dayne's chances to catch Ricky Williams and even  
contend for the Heisman Trophy look more promising, the Badgers are 
still angry. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every week, somebody seems to find a reason to criticize Ron  
Dayne,'' said coach Barry Alvarez, whose strategies for using Dayne 
also have come under scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really don't pay much attention. Ron and I talked about  
this. This guy has proven himself to everyone in the state the last 
four years, so if someone finds criticism, that's up to them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In amassing 1,234 rushing yards this season, Dayne has been good  
-- but rarely outstanding. The third-leading rusher in Division I 
history was a preseason favorite for the Heisman, but he fell out 
of favor after poor performances against Michigan and Minnesota 
several weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	He has been called too big, too injury-prone and too likely to  
disappear in big games, as he did by gaining no yards in the second 
half of the Badgers' loss to the Wolverines. 
</P>
<P>
	That rankled people in Madison, who see Dayne as a treasure,  
even a symbol of Badger football's rebirth under Alvarez. As the 
most prominent player to suit up for Wisconsin since Alan Ameche in 
the 1950s, Dayne is revered at his school, and attacks on him are 
seen as attacks on the Badgers. 
</P>
<P>
	In particular, offensive coordinator and running backs coach  
Brian White took umbrage at an article in Sports Illustrated 
labeling Dayne as one of the 10 biggest disappointments in college 
football this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's ridiculous. That's asinine,'' White fumed after Dayne  
rushed for 214 yards and two touchdowns in Wisconsin's win 40-10 
thrashing of Michigan State on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've said for about four weeks that it has been a travesty how  
he has been perceived by the national press. An absolute 
travesty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In its game-day press release for Wisconsin's game against  
Michigan State, the school listed an entire page of purported 
misconceptions about Dayne, entitled ``What's Myth and What's 
Fact?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``People around here are angry about what's been said about  
Ron,'' offensive lineman Casey Rabach said. ``We know what Ron can 
do. We're just going to keep going out there and doing it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dayne entered the season needing 1,717 yards to break Williams'  
career rushing record. With three games to go, Dayne needs 483 
yards against Northwestern, Purdue and Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	White guarantees Dayne will break the record if he stays  
healthy. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the best running back in the history of college  
football,'' White said. ``People don't know the value of Ron Dayne 
to our football program. They don't know what they're looking at, 
frankly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dayne may have lost too much ground in the Heisman race, but  
he's not concerned with the trophy, the record or his national 
image. In fact, he gets all the affirmation he needs after every 
carry. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always know the fans are behind me,'' Dayne said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Denies It Put Nukes in Iceland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. government has informed Iceland that,  
contrary to a magazine report last week, U.S. nuclear weapons were 
never deployed on the Nordic island during the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
	Breaking with a long-standing American policy of neither  
confirming nor denying the locations of nuclear weapons, the 
Clinton administration told the Icelandic government that the 
Bulletin of Atomic Scientists' article published Oct. 20 was wrong 
in naming Iceland as among 27 nuclear deployment sites. 
</P>
<P>
	It has long been U.S. policy to obtain the permission of host  
governments before deploying nuclear weapons in their territory. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulletin article -- written by military historians Robert S.  
Norris, William Arkin and William Burr -- was based on a newly 
declassified 1977 official Pentagon history of the custody and 
deployment of U.S. nuclear weapons. Nine locations of weapons were 
listed in an appendix to the Pentagon report. Government censors 
blacked out the names of 18 other locations, but the Bulletin 
authors said they deduced from other publicly available documents 
that Iceland was among the 18. 
</P>
<P>
	``While we will not fill in the names of places that were  
redacted from the original document, we want to make clear that the 
Bulletin of Atomic Scientists' conclusion that the document 
indicated U.S. nuclear weapons were deployed to Iceland is 
incorrect,'' Robert Sorenson, deputy chief of mission at the U.S. 
Embassy in Reykjavik, said in a telephone interview Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Jon Hannibalsson, Iceland's ambassador to Washington, was given  
that assurance the day the story appeared, Sorenson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a dead issue'' as far as the Iceland government is  
concerned, Hjalmar Hannesson, the director of political affairs at 
the Foreign Ministry in Reykjavik, said in a telephone interview 
Tuesday. He said his government was assured ``the name of Iceland 
is definitely not there on the list.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arkin said Tuesday: ``We may be wrong, but the evidence  
surrounding the nuclear history of Iceland continues to provide 
suspicions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulletin's publisher, Steve Schwartz, said the Clinton  
administration's willingness to publicly deny the Iceland story 
while keeping secret other information about nuclear deployments of 
decades ago ``points up the problems of the nuclear secrecy 
regime.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arkin initially asked the Pentagon for the nuclear weapons  
deployment history in 1983, but the still-censored version was not 
released until May. ``It's been a 16-year ordeal,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The other blacked-out Pentagon report entries include Okinawa,  
the Bulletin article said. The U.S. government has not disputed 
that, but will not confirm it either, even though National Security 
Council documents from 1969 -- publicly available at the National 
Archives for several years -- refer explicitly to ``the nuclear 
weapons stockpiles on Okinawa'' and discuss in detail U.S. 
government concerns that Japan might force the United States to 
withdraw the weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	The blacked-out entry that the Bulletin authors surmised was  
Iceland showed nuclear bomb components deployed between 1956 and 
1966 and complete nuclear bombs from 1956 to 1959. 
</P>
<P>
	Iceland is a NATO member, although it has no military forces.  
</P>
<P>
	The article cited a 1993 Center for Air Force History report  
that stated that major changes in operational capability at 
Keflavik air base in Iceland included U.S. Strategic Air Command 
aircraft ``accommodated'' in 1955-56, and the elimination of such 
activities in 1959-60. ``This is a perfect fit for the presence of 
the bombs'' described in the Pentagon report's appendix, they 
wrote.

<HEADLINE> Italian-Americans Recall W.W. II </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Dominic DiMaggio, the former Boston Red Sox  
center fielder and brother of Hall of Famer Joe DiMaggio, left 
baseball to fight for the United States in World War II, but 
returned home to find his Italian-immigrant father had been labeled 
an ``enemy alien.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio, 82, said Tuesday his father Giuseppe was barred from  
his trade of fishing and was even told not to visit friends at the 
wharf because of suspicions about his allegiance. 
</P>
<P>
	``He very rarely spoke about it,'' DiMaggio said after a hearing  
before the House Judiciary Committee's constitution panel. ``I know 
he was hurt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a little-remembered chapter of U.S. history, the government  
classified 600,000 residents of Italian descent as enemy aliens 
from late 1941 until Italy surrendered in 1943. They were forced to 
carry special identification and were forbidden from traveling more 
than five miles from home. 
</P>
<P>
	About 250 were imprisoned in Montana and New York, similar to  
thousands of ethnic Japanese who were sent to internment camps 
during the war. But in contrast to the Japanese-Americans, who won 
reparations, the Italian-Americans' plight has gone largely 
unnoticed. 
</P>
<P>
	In California, 52,000 Italian-Americans were confined to their  
homes from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. under a curfew. And in ports from 
Boston to Monterey, Calif., Italian-American fishermen were 
grounded and the Navy impounded their boats. 
</P>
<P>
	A bill by Republican Rep. Rick Lazio and Democratic Rep. Eliot  
Engel, both from New York, would force the president to acknowledge 
violations of civil rights and order a Justice Department report 
about the treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a matter of reparations or looking for money,'' said  
Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., who said he was ``dumbfounded'' when he 
heard about the treatment. ``The truth has been obscured. The truth 
ought to be told.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those mistreated included prominent people.  
</P>
<P>
	Ezio Pinza, a Metropolitan Opera singer in New York, was  
imprisoned on Ellis Island for nearly three months starting March 
12, 1942. His widow, Doris Pinza, said she was shocked he could be 
locked up and his house searched without being told the charges 
against him. 
</P>
<P>
	``We never suspected this could happen in the United States,''  
she told lawmakers in a quavering voice. 
</P>
<P>
	Pinza won his release after two hearings and sang the national  
anthem at the welcoming home ceremonies for Gen. George Patton in 
1945, she said.

<TEXT>
<P>
	For the better part of the evening, Florida State's Peter  
Warrick heard it from the record crowd at Clemson's Memorial 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jail-bird! Jail-bird!'' the Tigers fans chanted during the  
top-ranked Seminoles' 17-14 victory over Clemson. 
</P>
<P>
	On a special Saturday night that matched Bobby Bowden against  
his son, Tommy, in major-college football's first father-son 
coaching duel, Warrick's return to the lineup after a two-game 
suspension was a sad subplot. 
</P>
<P>
	He was booed from the minute he ran onto the field for warmups  
through his final reception. A sign outside the stadium said, 
``Nearest Dillard's 1 mile, Peter Warrick Special, 100 percent 
discount.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the game, Warrick wisely remained silent -- his best  
decision in weeks. He shook his head from side to side when 
reporters approached his locker. ``Pete doesn't want to talk,'' a 
Seminoles assistant said. 
</P>
<P>
	The star receiver, once the Heisman Trophy front-runner, was  
suspended from the team after his arrest for felony theft -- buying 
more than $400 of designer clothes for $21.40 from a store clerk at 
a department store. 
</P>
<P>
	Warrick was reinstated last Friday after he pleaded guilty to a  
lesser charge, misdemeanor petty theft. School policy prohibited 
him from playing while charged with a felony. 
</P>
<P>
	He helped the Seminoles with 11 catches for 121 yards, but  
bobbled at least four passes and didn't show his usual flair for 
turning short receptions into touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a night for the Bowdens, not Warrick.

	 *BCS BABBLE:* Roy Kramer, chairman of the Bowl Championship  
Series, was at it again Tuesday, trying to drum up interest along 
the road to the national championship. 
</P>
<P>
	He said if four teams finish the season with perfect records,  
such as Florida State, Penn State, Virginia Tech and Kansas State, 
there's a chance the two not chosen for the Sugar Bowl could be 
matched in another BCS bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is that flexibility in trying to help everyone put  
together as good a matchup as we possibly can,'' Kramer said during 
a conference call. ``I think that's healthy for all the bowls. We 
did that to a degree last year. They (the bowls) do have some 
freedom and flexibility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the first BCS standings, the Seminoles and Nittany Lions are  
1-2, with the Hokies third and Wildcats fifth behind once-beaten 
Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	Then again, it might be in the best interests of the ABC Sports,  
which televises the four BCS games (Sugar, Orange, Rose, Fiesta) to 
separate the other unbeatens. But once again, all this conjecture 
merely generates more debate. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we ended up in a scenario with Florida State and Penn State  
in the championship game and we still had Kansas State and Virginia 
Tech undefeated,'' Kramer began, ``we'd have more interest in those 
ballgames. Everyone would be trying to decide who was better in one 
of those games than the people playing in the championship game.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *QUOTABLE:* ``To get beat like that, it makes you think we're  
sorry. Oregon State wasn't supposed to be a good team, but they 
were against us.'' -- UCLA tailback Keith Brown after Saturday's 
55-7 loss to Oregon State, the Bruins' most lopsided defeat since a 
52-0 thrashing by USC on Sept. 27, 1930.

	 *PIGSKIN PREVIEW:* Looking ahead to next season?  
</P>
<P>
	Don't be surprised if the Pigskin Classic matches Florida State  
against BYU in its ``preseason'' game in late August. 
</P>
<P>
	Word is the game would be played in Jacksonville, Fla. The  
Cougars already have nonconference games at Syracuse and Virginia 
for next season. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------

	 *STATE OF SHOCK:* Michigan and Michigan State will have a hard  
time recovering from Shocking Saturday, a day that saw the 
Wolverines upset by Illinois 35-29 and the Spartans hammered by 
Wisconsin 40-10. 
</P>
<P>
	The losses left both Michigan schools with two-game losing  
streaks, out of the national title picture and with little hope for 
the Big Ten title. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nationally, there's no game out there that you know going in  
you're going to win,'' Michigan coach Lloyd Carr said Tuesday. 
``You may feel like you should win, but if you aren't ready to 
play, if you get a bad bounce, any game can go against you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan opened 5-0 and was ranked No. 3 before losses to  
Michigan State and Illinois sent the Wolverines tumbling to No. 15 
this week. Michigan State, up to No. 5 after beating Michigan on 
Oct. 9, plummeted to No. 19 following losses to Purdue and 
Wisconsin.

<HEADLINE> America's Cup Racing Resumes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) -- America True and Nippon called for  
delays because of gear failures, Young America turned up late, and 
the Swiss and French teams didn't turn up at all. 
</P>
<P>
	Above it all, Italy's Prada on Wednesday completed of clean  
sweep of round-robin 1 of the regatta to decide which will take on 
defending champion New Zealand for sailing's most prized trophy 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
	The challenger series for the America's Cup fell into disarray  
as problems on board, blustery weather and umpires' exemptions left 
only two real races out of a scheduled 10. 
</P>
<P>
	Prada had an easy victory over Hawaii's Abracadabra 2000,  
Italian skipper Francesco de Angelis' 10th victory from as many 
starts, and San Francisco's America True clawed back almost one 
minute in the last leg of its race against Nippon to lose by just 1 
second. 
</P>
<P>
	After a three-day postponement because of collision and mishap  
damage to two boats, racing resumed on Auckland's Hauraki Gulf in 
winds of around 20 knots and choppy seas. 
</P>
<P>
	In the morning races, Dennis Conner's Stars and Stripes got an  
easy start after rival Young America had a gear failure and had to 
return to port to make repairs. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials postponed the start, but not enough for Young America,  
which crossed the line just as Conner's team rounded the first mark 
to be a full leg in front and went on to win by 1 hour, 31 minutes, 
35 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Prada, the Spanish team and Nippon won after the teams they were  
supposed to race -- the French and the Swiss -- effectively forfeited 
by staying in port to work on their boats. 
</P>
<P>
	The two scheduled races for AmericaOne were postponed until  
Thursday while the team repairs damage from a collision with Stars 
and Stripes on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	In their morning race, the start for America True and Nippon was  
also delayed after gear failures on both boats. 
</P>
<P>
	Nippon skipper Peter Gilmour crossed the line ahead of Dawn  
Riley's America True after pre-start maneuvers left the Americans 
stalled as the gun fired. Gilmour took the wind advantage and 
finished the first upwind leg 10 boat lengths in front. 
</P>
<P>
	America True whittled Nippon's lead back in the first downward  
leg but looked to be too far behind when rounding the last turn to 
mount a serious challenge. 
</P>
<P>
	But with both boats plunging though the chop under spinnaker,  
America True chopped 57 seconds off Nippon's lead in the final run 
and crossed just 1 second behind. 
</P>
<P>
	In the afternoon pairings, Prada defeated Abracadabra by 5  
minutes, 58 seconds; America True defeated the Spanish challenge, 
which withdrew after a spinnaker became hopelessly tangled; and 
Stars and Stripes defeated Young Australia, which withdrew with a 
damaged batten. 
</P>
<P>
	In more than 700 races over four months, the 11 challenger teams  
from seven countries score one point for each victory in the first 
of three round-robins, four points in the second and nine in the 
third. 
</P>
<P>
	The winner of a finals series will meet Team New Zealand in a  
best-of-9 regatta starting in February 2000 for the America's Cup.

<HEADLINE> Buchanan: No Religious Test in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Presidential candidate Pat Buchanan said today  
that while he believes Christianity is the ``true faith,'' the 
Constitution forbids any official religion in America. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's open to people of all faiths,'' Buchanan, who is seeking  
the Reform Party nomination, said on ABC's ``Good Morning 
America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reminded that he has written that ``we have to re-establish the  
Christian community's belief as the legitimate moral foundation of 
American society,'' Buchanan replied: 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe Jesus Christ was the son of God and I believe  
Christianity is the true faith. I would like all folks to come to 
it but I do believe that America's Constitution forbids a religious 
test.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan, a former aide to Presidents Nixon and Reagan, said he  
has become the target of name-calling ``because people are afraid 
of the ideas I represent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A potential rival for the Reform Party nomination, builder  
Donald Trump, has called Buchanan a loser and a Hitler lover and 
said ``I guess he's an anti-Semite.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When interviewer Diane Sawyer began a question by referring to  
New York Times columnist and ex-Nixon aide William Safire as ``your 
friend,'' Buchanan responded: ``William Safire is not a friend of 
mine and I do not think he is an honorable man personally. ... 
</P>
<P>
	``I've gotta say I represent America first, I represent America  
only. Mr. Safire ... in my judgment has always put Israel a little 
bit ahead of his own country. ... When push comes to shove, we have 
to put the national interest of the United States of America ahead 
of any other country ... and that means Israel, as much as some 
folks love it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On NBC's ``Today,'' Buchanan said he hopes to put together ``a  
new coalition of those left out, left behind.''

<HEADLINE> NBC Cruises to Nielsens Victory / TV Ratings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- NBC crushed its competition in the television  
ratings last week, helped along by postseason baseball and ``ER.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NBC did even better than its previous week, when the network  
registered its best Nielsen Media Research ratings since June 1998. 
On average, NBC had more than 4 million more prime-time viewers 
last week than second-place CBS. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, bad news continued for Fox and the networks began  
bailing out in earnest from the failed shows of the fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Three NBC baseball games finished among the week's 10 most  
popular programs. The final game of the Mets-Braves playoff series 
actually outrated the first two games of the World Series, although 
slightly more people watched the series opening games. Overall, 
World Series ratings are up from last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``ER,'' with Alan Alda guest starring, was the week's most  
popular show. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC's strength on Thursdays has lain waste to competitors. ABC  
has temporarily yanked the drama ``Wasteland'' from its schedule. 
Fox's critically praised ``Action'' is a thorough disaster, losing 
in the ratings last week to UPN's ``WWF Smackdown!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fox has canceled its entire Friday night lineup, ``Harsh Realm''  
and ``Ryan Caulfield: Year One,'' after they finished Nos. 100 and 
108 in last week's ratings. 
</P>
<P>
	Except for baseball, only ``The Simpsons'' on Fox last week  
rated among the week's top 50 programs. The network's average 
prime-time viewership of 8.6 million people this fall is nearly 2 
million less than last year at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS has axed its Wednesday night comedy, ``Work With Me,'' which  
finished in 68th place last week. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week, NBC had an 11.8 rating and 20 share. CBS had a 9.0  
rating and 15 share, ABC had a 7.2 rating and 12 share and Fox had 
a 5.3 rating and 9 share. The WB had a 3.0 rating and 5 share, UPN 
was at 2.8 and 5, and Pax TV had a 0.8 rating and 1 share. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC's ``Nightly News'' won the evening news ratings race with a  
7.7 rating and 17 share. ABC's ``World News Tonight'' had a 7.3 
rating and 16 share, while the ``CBS Evening News'' had a 6.1 
rating and 13 share. 
</P>
<P>
	A rating point represents 1,008,000 households, or 1 percent of  
the nation's estimated 100.8 million TV homes. The share is the 
percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given show. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week of Oct. 18-24, the top 10 shows, their networks and  
ratings were ``ER,'' NBC, 20.1; ``National League Championship 
Series: N.Y. Mets vs. Atlanta,'' NBC, 15.4; ``Frasier,'' NBC, 15.0; 
``Friends,'' NBC, 15.0; ``World Series Game 2: N.Y. Yankees vs. 
Atlanta,'' NBC, 15.0; ``World Series Game 1: N.Y. Yankees vs. 
Atlanta,'' NBC, 14.2; ``Touched By an Angel,'' CBS, 13.1; ``CBS 
Sunday Movie: The Soul Collector,'' CBS, 12.4; ``Stark Raving 
Mad,'' NBC, 12.3. ``60 Minutes,'' CBS, 12.1 and ``NFL Monday Night 
Football: Dallas vs. N.Y. Giants,'' ABC, 12.1, tied for 10th place.

<HEADLINE> Coroner: Shepard Hit 20 Times </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LARAMIE, Wyo. (AP) -- Matthew Shepard was struck at least 20  
times, the blows raining down so hard that they fractured his skull 
a half-dozen times, a coroner testified today. 
</P>
<P>
	``Matthew Shepard died as a result of the blunt trauma injuries  
he sustained to his head and face,'' said Patrick Allen, coroner 
for Colorado's Larimer County, where Shepard died. 
</P>
<P>
	Some jurors winced as they viewed graphic photos of the  
homosexual college student's injuries, including his bloodied face 
and ear. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen testified as the trial of Aaron McKinney entered a second  
day in the Albany County Courthouse. He is accused of kidnapping, 
robbery and first-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorneys have said McKinney was guilty of manslaughter,  
but have argued that his judgment was affected by drugs, alcohol 
and childhood memories of sexual abuse. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, jurors saw pictures of the ponderosa pine fence where  
Shepard was left to die, his hands tied behind his back, and the 
pool of blood caused by blows as he fought his attackers. 
</P>
<P>
	Shepard's mother, Judy, dabbed her eyes when prosecutors showed  
jurors the graphic photos while McKinney's father, William, bowed 
his head. McKinney barely glanced up. 
</P>
<P>
	``Matthew Shepard made a frail attempt to fight back,'' said  
prosecutor Cal Rerucha during opening statements Monday. ``McKinney 
struck him as hard as he could.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorneys countered that McKinney, who faces the death  
penalty, didn't intend to kill Shepard when he and a friend 
accompanied Shepard from a Laramie bar after he asked McKinney for 
a ride home. 
</P>
<P>
	The 21-year-old University of Wyoming freshman was driven to a  
remote area, pistol-whipped and left overnight in near-freezing 
temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense portrayed McKinney as the victim of sexual abuse who  
lashed out when approached for a gay encounter. McKinney's judgment 
that night was affected by alcohol, methamphetamines and ``some 
sexually traumatic and confusing events in his life,'' defense 
attorney Jason Tangeman told jurors. 
</P>
<P>
	Tangeman said McKinney, 22, was confused by homosexual  
encounters when he was younger. In one case, McKinney was forced 
into an oral sex act with a neighborhood bully, Tangeman said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Did Matthew Shepard deserve to die? No, that's ridiculous. No  
manslaughter victim deserved to die,'' he said. ``That's what Aaron 
McKinney is guilty of -- manslaughter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McKinney has been charged with first-degree murder, kidnapping  
and robbery. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial of the other man accused of the slaying that shocked  
the nation, Russell Henderson, ended in April just before a jury 
was seated. Henderson pleaded guilty to felony murder and 
kidnapping and was sentenced to life in prison. The plea allowed 
Henderson to avoid the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, prosecutors called their first three witnesses: Aaron  
Kreifels, the college student who found Shepard; Charles Dolan, the 
neighbor who tried to help; and Albany County Deputy Reggie Fluty, 
who said she told the barely breathing victim, ``Baby, I'm so sorry 
this happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kreifels and Dolan described efforts to free Shepard from the  
fence, his hands tied to the bottom of a post. Fluty said it 
appeared Shepard had been crying. Shepard was taken to a hospital 
where he died five days later.

<HEADLINE> McKeon Still Mulling Reds' Offer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Manager Jack McKeon is still thinking about  
the Cincinnati Reds' offer of a one-year contract extension. 
</P>
<P>
	McKeon talked to managing executive John Allen and general  
manager Jim Bowden on Monday, three days after the club made its 
offer. He declined to talk about specifics of the updated one-year 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	McKeon wants a multiyear deal after leading the Reds to 96 wins,  
their best total since the Big Red Machine in 1976. Cincinnati came 
within one win of making the playoffs with a $35 million payroll. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not ready to make a decision yet,'' McKeon said in a  
telephone interview from his home in North Carolina. ``I'm going to 
mull it over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Reds have declined to talk about their offers to McKeon,  
whose one-year contract expired at the end of the season. A 
telephone message left with Allen was not returned. 
</P>
<P>
	McKeon hoped to get a multiyear deal that included a raise over  
the roughly $500,000 he made this year in base pay and incentives. 
The Reds' original offer last Friday reportedly amounted to an 
increase of less than $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
	McKeon, who turns 69 next month, reiterated that his main  
concern is getting more than a one-year contract. The Reds waited 
until new ownership took over for Marge Schott this month before 
making their offer. 
</P>
<P>
	The club was criticized in the media for its offer to McKeon,  
who is a candidate for NL Manager of the Year. The Reds missed the 
playoffs by losing a tiebreaker to the New York Mets for the NL 
wild card. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got a lot of people calling me from the organization  
wanting me to come back, so that's kind of made a little 
difference,'' McKeon said.

<HEADLINE> Bill To Boost Africa Trade Advances </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A bill to reduce most tariffs on African  
products won a major vote in the Senate, but the legislation still 
faces many hurdles as senators sought to load it with amendments. 
</P>
<P>
	Some farm-state senators moved Tuesday to attach a previously  
spurned amendment to ease a trade embargo on Cuba and other nations 
under U.S. sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Democrats saw the legislation, one of the last major bills  
other than spending measures expected to move through Congress this 
year, as a chance to revive an effort for a $1 increase in the 
$5.15 minimum wage. 
</P>
<P>
	Late Tuesday, a spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott,  
R-Miss., suggested that offering the minimum wage amendment could 
prompt Lott to pull the bill from Senate consideration. 
</P>
<P>
	``That would have the effect of killing this bill,'' said the  
spokesman, John Czwartacki. He said the core legislation has 
``broad bipartisan support ..., a bill we'd all like to do and get 
done this session.'' The legislation, designed to spur economic 
growth and private investment in 48 sub-Saharan countries, has been 
passed by the House two years in a row but has stalled in the 
Senate because of unrelated issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``Africa has for too long suffered from our neglect,'' said  
Finance Committee Chairman William Roth, R-Del., the bill's 
principal sponsor. ``African leaders are seizing the opportunity to 
press for political and economic change. The goal is to meet 
Africa's leaders halfway.'' 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton applauded the Senate's action, saying the  
legislation is necessary to improve political ties and increase 
trade and economic growth in both the United States and Africa. ``I 
urge Congress to pass this legislation this year,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	But textile-state senators, who used delaying tactics to prevent  
the Senate from considering the bill, asserted the measure would 
result in a flood of low-cost imports from Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Ernest F. Hollings, D-S.C., called the legislation ``a  
one-way street. ... This is not a trade bill; it's a foreign aid 
bill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I still believe in fair trade, but there is nothing in this  
bill that is fair to the U.S. apparel and textile industry,'' Sen. 
Jim Bunning, R-Ky., said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate voted 90-8 Tuesday to end the delaying tactics and  
proceed to debate the bill. The earliest a final vote is expected 
will be Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the bill began as an attempt to lower trade barriers  
for sub-Saharan Africa, Roth was seeking to add additional measures 
to give preferential trade treatment to Caribbean and Central 
American nations. 
</P>
<P>
	Furthermore, senators seeking to end the use of agricultural  
sanctions suggested they might try to attach their legislation. 
They would amend the bill to allow food, medicine and medical 
supplies to nations under U.S. sanctions unless the president cites 
national security grounds for denying such shipments. 
</P>
<P>
	House-Senate negotiators rejected efforts to put a similar  
provision on an agricultural spending bill earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is H.R. 434.

<HEADLINE> Senators Want Nomination Changes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two senators from different political parties  
and opposite ends of the nation introduced legislation Tuesday that 
would require presidential nominees to be picked by region in 2004, 
rather than the current selection process led by New Hampshire and 
Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	The sponsors, Sens. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., and Joseph Lieberman,  
D-Conn., acknowledged, however, that the four senators from those 
first-in-the nation states would filibuster their bill to death. 
</P>
<P>
	``I understand the local interest'' among New Hampshire and Iowa  
lawmakers in killing the bill, Lieberman told reporters. ``But 
overall, this system is not serving the country well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is the latest shot in a fight over the nomination  
schedule, which next year is set so that roughly 75 percent of the 
delegates will be picked by March 7. Both parties are almost 
certain to have a nominee within six weeks of Iowa's opening test. 
Critics say the system gives the first states too much influence 
over the process, and puts undue pressure on candidates to race 
around the country. 
</P>
<P>
	The system, Gorton said, has become ``an absurd rush to  
judgment'' that does not resemble the vision the nation's founders 
had of considered nominee selection. 
</P>
<P>
	``Small and large states with later primaries are shut out of  
the selection process,'' Gorton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is identical to the one he and Lieberman introduced in  
1996, but the Senate never acted on it. Its prospects this year are 
just as bleak, they conceded. 
</P>
<P>
	Gorton and Lieberman propose that the first Tuesdays in March,  
April, May and June be primary election dates for specific regions 
of the country -- similar to having a ``Super Tuesday'' for each 
area, the sponsors said. The four regions would consist of 12 or 13 
states, divided into West, Midwest, South and Northeast. The 
national parties would assign territories, such as Guam and Puerto 
Rico, to one of the four regions. 
</P>
<P>
	Each state would determine how its delegates would be picked,  
selecting either a winner-takes-all method of representation at the 
national convention, or a proportional plan. Each state also would 
decide whether to hold caucuses or primaries.

<HEADLINE> Bush Touts Texas' No Income Tax </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- In a new television commercial touting his  
tax-cutting record, Republican presidential front-runner George W. 
Bush boasts that in his home state of Texas, ``We still have no 
personal income tax.'' 
</P>
<P>
	True. The Texas Constitution prohibits the Legislature from  
imposing a personal income tax without voter approval. That ban was 
proposed by a Democratic-majority Legislature and ratified by 
voters the year before Bush was elected governor. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's campaign said Tuesday it is accurate for Bush to cite the  
lack of a state income tax as part of his fiscal record. 
</P>
<P>
	``Governor Bush has always opposed a personal state income tax.  
Texas still has no income tax,'' campaign spokesman Scott McClellan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Governor Bush has shown that if you set clear priorities, you  
can fully fund education and send money back to taxpayers instead 
of overcommitting to a bunch of government programs,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas state government -- once flush with oil and gas revenues --  
today gets more than 27 percent of all its revenue from sales 
taxes, according to the comptroller's office. 
</P>
<P>
	After several tough years beginning with the mid-1980s oil bust,  
then Lt. Gov. Bob Bullock suggested in the early 1990s that the 
time might have come to consider an income tax. 
</P>
<P>
	Reaction was so negative that Bullock, a Democrat, led a push in  
the 1993 legislative session for the constitutional ban. 
</P>
<P>
	That amendment, approved in November 1993, prohibits the  
Legislature from imposing a personal income tax unless voters 
agree. It also requires that at least two-thirds of any income 
tax's net revenues be used to reduce property taxes that fund 
schools, with the rest going to education. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas Democratic Party chair Molly Beth Malcolm said Bullock and  
other Democrats deserve credit for the income tax ban. 
</P>
<P>
	She said that if Bush had gotten his way on a 1997 tax overhaul  
plan, Texas would have had ``the state's first tax on certain 
income in order to give big corporate interests and wealthy 
homeowners a (property) tax break.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 1997 proposal was part of a Bush plan to reduce the property  
taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	To help fund the cut, Bush proposed raising sales taxes and  
imposing a new business activity tax. That levy would have applied 
to many businesses that escaped the state's franchise tax on 
business -- including lawyers, architects and others organized as 
professional associations or partnerships. 
</P>
<P>
	While Bush's proposal stalled, lawmakers approved a $1 billion  
reduction in local school property taxes. Bush's campaign said that 
is the bottom line in any tax debate. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gov. Bush proposed comprehensive tax reform -- a net $1 billion  
tax cut, reforming the way Texas funds its schools and replacing 
the business franchise tax with a lower, flatter and fairer tax. 
The ultimate result of his leadership was a $1 billion tax cut,'' 
McClellan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another Bush ad was criticized Tuesday by one of his opponents,  
Steve Forbes. 
</P>
<P>
	In that TV commercial, airing in Iowa and New Hampshire, an  
announcer says Bush ``reduced the growth of state government 
spending to the lowest in 40 years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Several Texas newspapers have independently analyzed Governor  
Bush's spending record and have concluded that state spending has 
risen 35 percent or more since Bush took office,'' said Forbes 
campaign chairman Ken Blackwell. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal spending under President Clinton is up 21 percent,  
Blackwell said. ``George Bush makes Bill Clinton look like a fiscal 
conservative.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush spokeswoman Mindy Tucker said the charge was ``misleading''  
and ``says more about Steve Forbes than it does about Governor 
Bush.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Tucker said Bush's record includes cutting the growth of  
state spending to its lowest level in four decades; signing $3 
billion in tax cuts; and overseeing a state that ranks 50th in per 
capita state spending of tax dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	The two-year Texas state budget approved in May calls for  
spending of about $98.1 billion. That's nearly 31 percent more than 
the $74.9 billion the state comptroller's office says was spent 
under the last two-year budget enacted before Bush's 1994 election. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bush campaign says the increase reflects, in part, the  
state's growing population. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Tucker said spending increases in each of the two-year  
budgets enacted during Bush's tenure in the Statehouse have ranged 
from 8.2 percent in 1996-1997 to 9 percent for 2000-2001. 
</P>
<P>
	In computing those increases, the Bush campaign did not include  
more than $3 billion given to school districts to lower property 
taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Governor Bush actually has a record of fiscal responsibility  
that includes setting clear priorities, increasing funding for 
public education, passing the two largest tax cuts in Texas history 
and bringing about a dramatic reduction in the growth of state 
spending,'' Ms. Tucker said.

	CORAL GABLES, Fla. (AP) -- Miami quarterback Kenny Kelly, who led  
the 23rd-ranked Hurricanes to 31 second-half points and a dramatic, 
come-from-behind victory over Boston College last weekend, might be 
sidelined for Saturday's game against West Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelly had a hard cast placed on his sprained left ankle Sunday  
and is not expected to practice until later this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``It'll be an ongoing thing through the course of the week,''  
Hurricanes coach Butch Davis said Tuesday. ``He's sore and he's 
tender. He's probably going to be very limited, particularly during 
the early part of the week, and then we'll make some kind of 
assessment later on in the week as he starts to move around.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kelly said the cast, which he anticipated having removed  
Wednesday, was only precautionary and he definitely will play. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just a little sprain and I should be all right for this  
weekend,'' Kelly said. ``I am playing. It's not that serious where 
I can't play. The doctors just want to be safe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kelly, a sophomore from Tampa, is coming off the best two games  
of his career. He was 27-of-41 for 370 yards and three touchdowns 
in a loss to top-ranked Florida State on Oct. 9. 
</P>
<P>
	Then he was 20-of-36 for 218 yards and three TDs against the  
Eagles. He led the Hurricanes (3-3) to three touchdowns in a span 
of about 13 minutes en route to the biggest comeback in school 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelly sprained his ankle on the second play of the game-winning  
drive, when Boston College's Chris Hovan sacked him. 
</P>
<P>
	``My ankle got caught in the turf and one of the d-linemen kind  
of twisted my ankle up under the pile,'' Kelly said. ``I think it 
was purposely, but that's part of football. I'm pretty sure our 
defensive linemen do that too. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a lot of pain, but I was going to do whatever it took  
to win that game. Even if I would have broken my ankle, I wouldn't 
have came out. We needed that game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Kelly does not play against the Mountaineers, Davis said  
freshman Ken Dorsey would start. Dorsey has played in just one 
game, mop-up duty in Miami's 57-3 rout of Florida A&AMP;M, and was 
4-of-12 for 44 yards with a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Ken Dorsey does have to play, we won't alter or change one  
single thing about our game plan,'' Davis said. ``He knows 
everything we're doing and he's been prepared every week to be able 
to go into ballgames and play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, Davis and the Hurricanes are hopeful Kelly will  
play. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kenny's a warrior,'' defensive tackle Matt Sweeney said. ``I'm  
pretty sure he'll be out there. He's a tough guy. Even if he's not 
100 percent, he'll still be out there and you won't be able to tell 
his ankle is bothering him.''

<HEADLINE> UAW Workers Ratify Ford Contract </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- United Auto Workers members at Ford Motor Co.  
have ratified a new four-year contract, with 85 percent of those 
voting casting a ballot in favor. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote ends months of negotiations that saw the UAW win gains  
in wages and pensions without a major walkout. The union has said 
that its deals with Ford, General Motors Corp. and DaimlerChrysler 
AG will increase the average member's pay by $29,000 over four 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're very proud of this contract and the teamwork that made  
it possible,'' UAW President Stephen P. Yokich said in a statement. 
``It's rewarding to know that the UAW Ford membership supports the 
agreement by such a substantial margin.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vote totals were not immediately available; the union represents  
about 100,000 Ford workers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ford contract mirrors many of the terms agreed to by GM and  
DaimlerChrysler -- 3 percent raises each year, a $1,350 signing 
bonus and improvements in pensions. 
</P>
<P>
	It also guarantees Ford jobs for about 23,500 workers in parts  
plants even if Ford turns its Visteon Automotive Systems parts 
division into a separate company. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're very happy,'' said Ford spokesman Edward Miller. ``We  
feel this is a contract that preserves Ford's competitiveness while 
taking care of the needs of workers and their families.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The future of Visteon had been one of the most contentious  
issues in this year's talks. Ford is expected to spin off Visteon, 
just as GM did with its Delphi Automotive Systems last year. The 
theory is that the parts divisions need more business than GM or 
Ford alone can provide, but other companies would not work with 
them unless they were independent. 
</P>
<P>
	Before contract negotiations, the UAW had opposed the move,  
fearing it would lead to lower pay and fewer jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	``This contract represents excellent progress for UAW Ford  
families and delivers full protection for our members who work at 
Visteon now and in the future,'' said UAW Vice President Ron 
Gettelfinger. 
</P>
<P>
	The union said that under the deal, workers at Visteon will  
remain Ford employees for life -- with Ford paychecks and pensions -- 
if Visteon becomes independent. Those workers would also be free to 
transfer back and forth between Ford and Visteon. 
</P>
<P>
	New workers at a separate Visteon would be covered by an  
agreement that mirrors the one the UAW has with Ford; that 
arrangement will continue for two contracts after the new deal 
between the union and Ford expires. Similar terms were negotiated 
in the contracts between GM, Delphi and the UAW. 
</P>
<P>
	GM and DaimlerChrysler workers also ratified their contracts by  
wide margins.

<HEADLINE> Nuke Plants Said To Need Y2K Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congresssional auditors say the government  
should take additional steps to ensure that the year 2000 computer 
bug will not cause dangerous malfunctions at any of the nation's 
nuclear plants. 
</P>
<P>
	``To further reduce risks, NRC and the nuclear power industry  
can still take specific action to ensure Y2K-related plant 
safety,'' the General Accounting Office said in testimony prepared 
for a hearing Tuesday before the House Science technology 
subcommittee . 
</P>
<P>
	GAO officials said the Nuclear Regulatory Commission should:  
</P>
<P>
	--Require independent verification of plants' claims of Y2K  
readiness. 
</P>
<P>
	--Determine whether plants' most recent emergency exercises have  
included Y2K-specific scenarios in addition to general disaster 
preparedness. 
</P>
<P>
	--Ensure each plant has a checklist of things that must be done  
before and after New Year's Eve midnight. 
</P>
<P>
	GAO officials also said the NRC should follow up to ensure that  
other types of nuclear facilities have made good on Y2K readiness 
promises. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission's deputy director for reactor programs, Frank  
Miraglia, sought to reassure lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will closely monitor the progress of plants that still have  
some systems left to remediate, but we fully expect that all 
commercial nuclear power plants will operate safely, as planned and 
without interruption, through the Y2K transition,'' Miraglia said. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States has in operation 103 nuclear power plants at  
66 sites, mostly in the East. Another 19 plants are no longer 
working, but 14 still have stored highly radioactive spent nuclear 
fuel. Ten more U.S. plants produce nuclear fuel. 
</P>
<P>
	The NRC has reported that all the operating power plants are Y2K  
ready except Philadelphia Electric Co.'s Peach Bottom 3 in 
Pennsylvania and Southern Nuclear Operating Co.'s Farley 2 in 
Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
	The two remaining plants have completed work on their safety  
systems but must finish repairing operating equipment, the NRC 
says. The Pennsylvania plant is to be ready by the end of October. 
Work at the Alabama plant is to be finished by mid-December. 
</P>
<P>
	The NRC also has reported that all decommissioned plants and  
fuel-making facilities were on track to be Y2K ready, although the 
agency's latest information does not confirm that readiness has 
been achieved at all sites.

<HEADLINE> World's Greatest Goalie? Not Anymore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Where's Dominik Hasek? Don't look among the  
NHL's statistical leaders for the two-time league MVP and best 
goaltender in five of the last six seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1998 Olympic gold medalist? Has anybody seen him?  
</P>
<P>
	This was supposed to be a farewell victory tour for Hasek, who  
plans to retire at the end of the season and return to his native 
Czech Republic. 
</P>
<P>
	But so far, this season has been a gauntlet for the Sabres  
goaltender, who is winless (0-4-1). 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course, it's frustrating when you lose a game,'' Hasek said  
Monday. ``I haven't won a game yet, and it's very frustrating not 
to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek, benched for two games and pulled from two others, is not  
even the league's top Dom this season; that honor belongs to 
Anaheim's Dominic Roussel. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek is not the only Sabres player who suddenly seems to have  
forgotten which end of the stick to use, however. 
</P>
<P>
	``Going through the playoffs last year, we were in a zone where  
we had every guy playing so well and zoned right in,'' coach Lindy 
Ruff said. ``Right now, there are times in every game where it 
seems like every guy is zoned right out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coming off a season in which he carried the Sabres to the  
Stanley Cup finals, Hasek has struggled to compile a modest 3.20 
goals-against average and .907 save percentage. Last year's numbers 
in those two categories, 1.87 and .937, were the best of Hasek's 
illustrious career despite a nagging groin injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, it's the questions that are nagging.  
</P>
<P>
	Who will start the next game? Hasek is no longer a given. ``I'm  
not announcing my starting goaltender for Wednesday,'' Ruff said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruff and the Sabres don't blame Hasek. The Sabres (1-6-2) have  
not played well. When they have, bad luck has tripped them. 
</P>
<P>
	Buffalo was tied by Phoenix in the final seconds by a pinball of  
a shot that deflected off defenseman Alexei Zhitnik and crept 
underneath Hasek's glove. 
</P>
<P>
	And take Saturday's 4-0 loss to Ottawa. Please.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was just a mental state we were in,'' said Ruff, whose team  
swept the Senators from the playoffs last season but was outshot by 
Ottawa over the weekend 30-9 after two periods and 35-19 overall. 
</P>
<P>
	``Players weren't in the right position,'' Ruff said. ``The  
careless turnovers is probably what cost us the game in the first 
period. Those are the plays that kill you, and we probably had 
20-plus turnovers against a great transition team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres haven't played well with Hasek in goal or on the  
bench. 
</P>
<P>
	``We played pretty well against Phoenix and were tied on a  
bizarre goal,'' Ruff said. ``We played all right in Montreal -- Dom 
played well there -- and we lost that 2-1 with no offense. This is a 
strange game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The solution is not obvious to Ruff. ``We've tried early  
practices, late practices, long videos, short videos, positive 
videos, negative videos. You try everything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martin Biron, Hasek's heir apparent, posted the only win of the  
season Friday night after being called up from the team's AHL 
affiliate in Rochester. 
</P>
<P>
	Biron, who beat Carolina 7-3, employs Hasek's flopping style.  
</P>
<P>
	``I still look at Dom the same way I looked at him last year,''  
Biron said. ``You always get in a situation where it doesn't go 
your way, but that comes back.''

<HEADLINE> Warm Winter Seen for South </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans across the Southern tier of the  
nation can anticipate a milder than usual winter, but stormy 
weather is the outlook for the Northwest and Great Lakes states. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Weather Service says the Pacific Ocean phenomenon  
called La Nina will affect the nation's weather by changing the 
strength and pattern of the Pacific jet stream over North America. 
</P>
<P>
	The result will ``give us a warm and dry winter in the southern  
half of the nation but more snow and rain in the Pacific Northwest 
and Great Lakes,'' D. James Baker, head of the National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration, said Tuesday as the agency issued its 
winter weather forecast. 
</P>
<P>
	``We expect considerable month-to-month variation in  
temperature, rainfall and storminess in the Central, Northern and 
Eastern states, which means days of warmer than normal temperatures 
followed by bouts of bitter cold,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	La Nina is a periodic cooling of a large area of the tropical  
Pacific Ocean. It can alternate with an ocean warming called El 
Nino. Both can affect weather worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	In Southeastern areas plagued by drought last summer the outlook  
is for normal to below normal moisture in coming months, said Louis 
Uccellini, director of the National Weather Service's National 
Center for Environmental Prediction. That may be a boon, however, 
to flooded areas of North Carolina, permitting the ground to dry, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Over the past decade we have improved the forecasting of La  
Nina and El Nino so that we can now predict these events and their 
expected climatic impacts on different regions with 70 to 80 
percent accuracy a year before they occur,'' said John J. Kelly, 
director of the Weather Service. The service is part of the 
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	The annual Weather Service forecast came a day after NASA  
researchers in Pasadena, Calif., issued their own similar forecast 
calling for a wet winter across the Northwest and a dry one in the 
Southwest. 
</P>
<P>
	The regional winter forecasts from the National Weather Service  
were: 
</P>
<P>
	--Alaska: Colder and drier than normal.  
</P>
<P>
	--Hawaii: Colder and wetter than normal.  
</P>
<P>
	--Pacific Northwest: Above normal precipitation and increased  
storminess. Near normal temperatures. Above normal snowfall. 
</P>
<P>
	--California: Below normal temperatures near the coast. Above  
normal precipitation in the north, below normal in the south. 
</P>
<P>
	--Southwest: Above normal temperatures, below normal  
precipitation. Below normal snowfall in eastern New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	--Northern Plains: Near normal temperatures and above normal  
precipitation. Significant arctic outbreaks likely. 
</P>
<P>
	--Rocky Mountain region: Near to above normal temperatures. Above  
normal precipitation in the north, below normal in the south. 
</P>
<P>
	--Midwest: Near to above normal temperatures moving from north to  
south, above normal precipitation entire region. Above normal 
snowfall in upper Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
	--New England: Warmer than normal in southern New England; jet  
stream makes prediction uncertain in northern New England. 
</P>
<P>
	--Southern Tier: Warmer and drier than normal, with dryness most  
likely in New Mexico, south and west Texas and Florida. Below 
normal snowfall in northern Texas and central Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
	--Mid-Atlantic: Milder than normal with near normal precipitation  
east of the Appalachians. 
</P>
<P>
	--Ohio and Tennessee River Valleys: Warmer and wetter than  
normal. Increased number of heavy precipitation events and an 
increased risk of severe winter weather. Above normal snowfall. 
</P>
<P>
	--Great Lakes and Northeast: High degree of uncertainty.  
Considerable variability from week to week with above normal 
temperatures in southern areas and closer to normal in the north. 
Above normal snowfall in northern Great Lakes. Near normal 
precipitation south and east of the Appalachians, above normal 
elsewhere.

<HEADLINE> Tourney Alters Schedule for Service  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MADISON, Miss. (AP) -- The Southern Farm Bureau Classic will  
suspend play on Friday and push its final round back to Monday to 
allow players to attend a memorial service in Florida for Payne 
Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
	A pro-am tournament Wednesday and the opening round Thursday  
will be played as planned, but PGA Tour official Arvin Ginn said 
the schedule for the rest of Mississippi's only PGA Tour event 
would be altered in the wake of the U.S. Open champion's death 
Monday in a plane crash. 
</P>
<P>
	There will be no golf at Annandale Golf Club on Friday, the day  
that a memorial service is being held for Stewart. A charter flight 
is being arranged for players in the tournament who want to attend 
that service in Orlando, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	Southern Farm Bureau officials also said that a memorial service  
would be held Thursday night at a Jackson, Miss., church. 
</P>
<P>
	Ginn said the plans are to play the second round and make the  
cut in the 132-player field on Saturday. The third round would then 
be held Sunday and the final round Monday.

<HEADLINE> NTSB Begins Stewart Crash Inquiry Doomed the Learjet%xhl) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                         *By JOHN MacDONALD 	
</P>
<P>
                      *Associated Press Writer    	
</P>
<P>
	MINA, S.D. (AP) -- Investigators began gathering the remains of  
golfer Payne Stewart and five others from the area around a 
10-foot-deep crater in a soggy pasture Tuesday, hoping to determine 
whether a sudden loss in cabin pressure doomed their Learjet. 
</P>
<P>
	Dressed in heavy overalls against a cold wind, members of the  
National Transportation Safety Board spent all day at the South 
Dakota crash site, picking through the wreckage not only for the 
victims but for identifiable pieces of the shattered aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators cautioned that there will be no quick explanation  
for why no one was conscious at the controls for four hours Monday, 
when the jet flew 1,400 miles across the country before running out 
of fuel and slamming nose-first into the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	The plane had no flight data recorder that could yield  
information on the aircraft and its performance. 
</P>
<P>
	It had a cockpit voice recorder, but it consisted of a 30-minute  
loop that usually records over itself. And Stewart and the others 
on the plane presumably were already unconscious or dead by the 
last half-hour of the flight. The cockpit recorder had not been 
found as of Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the plane's debris is embedded in mud and soil within a  
10-foot-deep, 30-foot-wide crater, said Bob Francis, vice chairman 
of the National Transportation Safety Board. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks like the aircraft was pretty much vertical when it  
hit the ground,'' he said. ``The ground is soft, and it went in 
fairly deep. It's going to be a challenge, with the wreckage and 
sorting out what's there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators searched around the edge of the crater on Tuesday  
and plan to search inside it on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	They were sending tissue samples from the victims to a medical  
examiner's lab to test for such substances as carbon monoxide. 
</P>
<P>
	But Brad Randall, a state medical examiner, said toxicology  
tests may be worthless in attempting to verify one possible theory 
for the accident -- that the victims suffered oxygen deprivation 
because of a sudden decompression of the aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
	Planes that fly above 12,000 feet are pressurized because the  
air does not contain enough oxygen for people to breathe 
comfortably. If a plane loses pressure at high altitude, those 
aboard could slowly lose consciousness or, if an aircraft broke a 
door or window seal, perish in seconds from lack of oxygen. 
</P>
<P>
	If a plane loses cabin pressure, pilots are supposed to put on  
oxygen masks and quickly descend to 12,000 feet or lower. There was 
no evidence suggesting the pilots of Stewart's jet made any effort 
to do so, but Francis declined to speculate what that could mean. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, air traffic controllers were unable to raise anyone  
aboard the plane by radio soon after it took off from Orlando, Fla. 
Fighter pilots who chased after the plane were unable to see into 
the Learjet because its windows were frosted over, indicating the 
temperature inside was well below freezing. 
</P>
<P>
	Francis confirmed that the crew of one of the fighter jets made  
a videotape of the Learjet. 
</P>
<P>
	``It appears that the video was taken through a heads-up display  
on the aircraft, and the quality is probably not going to be good 
enough to help us,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said the air temperature at the altitude the jet was  
flying would have been minus 70 degrees. Together, the evidence 
raised suspicions that the plane had experienced a catastrophic 
loss of cabin pressure. 
</P>
<P>
	Four years ago, federal regulators ordered that valves that  
regulate pressure on Learjets be replaced to ``prevent rapid 
decompression of the airplane.'' The Federal Aviation 
Administration gave owners 18 months to comply. 
</P>
<P>
	James Watkins, president of Sunjet Aviation Inc., which operated  
the jet, told The Washington Post for a story in Wednesday's 
editions that the aircraft's maintenance log books showed that the 
new valves had been installed. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA also limited planes to an altitude of 41,000 feet until  
the valves were replaced because of the possibility they could 
fail. 
</P>
<P>
	In the plane's last radio transmission above Gainesville, Fla.,  
the pilot was instructed to climb to 39,000 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	The 23-year-old, eight-passenger plane had logged more than  
10,000 hours of flight time but had no history of serious 
mechanical problems, according to the FAA. 
</P>
<P>
	Watkins said the plane had been inspected before it took off and  
four other times in the past week. He also told the Post that when 
Sunjet began operating the plane, it underwent a mandatory FAA 
inspection and was certified to be in compliance with all FAA 
directives that applied. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart, 42, with his knickers and tam-o'-shanter hat, was one  
of the world's most recognizable golfers. He won 18 tournaments, 
including two U.S. Open titles. He also was part of the team that 
helped the United States stage a historic comeback to beat Europe 
last month for the Ryder Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart and his wife, Tracey, had two children, ages 10 and 13.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's an irreplaceable guy,'' fellow golfer Duffy Waldorf said.  
``I think of Payne Stewart and there's a guy that's going to be 
like Jack Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer, a guy you want around all 
those years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also killed were Stewart's agents, Robert Fraley and Van Ardan,  
and the two pilots, Michael Kling, 43, and Stephanie Bellegarrigue, 
27. Bruce Borland, 40, one of Nicklaus' golf course designers, was 
also believed to have been on the plane. 
</P>
<P>
	Kling had flown approximately 4,000 hours, however, Francis said  
only 37 of those were in a Learjet. He became eligible to fly the 
Learjet a month ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Bellegarrigue had between 1,000 and 2,000 hours, Francis said.  
It was not clear how many hours were in a Learjet.

	MINA, S.D. (AP) -- Investigators began gathering the remains of  
golfer Payne Stewart and five others from the area around a 
10-foot-deep crater in a soggy pasture Tuesday, hoping to determine 
whether a sudden loss in cabin pressure doomed their Learjet. 
</P>
<P>
	Dressed in heavy overalls against a cold wind, members of the  
National Transportation Safety Board spent all day at the South 
Dakota crash site, picking through the wreckage not only for the 
victims but for identifiable pieces of the shattered aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators cautioned that there will be no quick explanation  
for why no one was conscious at the controls for four hours Monday, 
when the jet flew 1,400 miles across the country before running out 
of fuel and slamming nose-first into the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	The plane had no flight data recorder that could yield  
information on the aircraft and its performance. 
</P>
<P>
	It had a cockpit voice recorder, but it consisted of a 30-minute  
loop that usually records over itself. And Stewart and the others 
on the plane presumably were already unconscious or dead by the 
last half-hour of the flight. The cockpit recorder had not been 
found as of Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the plane's debris is embedded in mud and soil within a  
10-foot-deep, 30-foot-wide crater, said Bob Francis, vice chairman 
of the National Transportation Safety Board. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks like the aircraft was pretty much vertical when it  
hit the ground,'' he said. ``The ground is soft, and it went in 
fairly deep. It's going to be a challenge, with the wreckage and 
sorting out what's there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators searched around the edge of the crater on Tuesday  
and plan to search inside it on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	They were sending tissue samples from the victims to a medical  
examiner's lab to test for such substances as carbon monoxide. 
</P>
<P>
	But Brad Randall, a state medical examiner, said toxicology  
tests may be worthless in attempting to verify one possible theory 
for the accident -- that the victims suffered oxygen deprivation 
because of a sudden decompression of the aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
	Planes that fly above 12,000 feet are pressurized because the  
air does not contain enough oxygen for people to breathe 
comfortably. If a plane loses pressure at high altitude, those 
aboard could slowly lose consciousness or, if an aircraft broke a 
door or window seal, perish in seconds from lack of oxygen. 
</P>
<P>
	If a plane loses cabin pressure, pilots are supposed to put on  
oxygen masks and quickly descend to 12,000 feet or lower. There was 
no evidence suggesting the pilots of Stewart's jet made any effort 
to do so, but Francis declined to speculate what that could mean. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, air traffic controllers were unable to raise anyone  
aboard the plane by radio soon after it took off from Orlando, Fla. 
Fighter pilots who chased after the plane were unable to see into 
the Learjet because its windows were frosted over, indicating the 
temperature inside was well below freezing. 
</P>
<P>
	Francis confirmed that the crew of one of the fighter jets made  
a videotape of the Learjet. 
</P>
<P>
	``It appears that the video was taken through a heads-up display  
on the aircraft, and the quality is probably not going to be good 
enough to help us,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said the air temperature at the altitude the jet was  
flying would have been minus 70 degrees. Together, the evidence 
raised suspicions that the plane had experienced a catastrophic 
loss of cabin pressure. 
</P>
<P>
	Four years ago, federal regulators ordered that valves that  
regulate pressure on Learjets be replaced to ``prevent rapid 
decompression of the airplane.'' The Federal Aviation 
Administration gave owners 18 months to comply. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Francis said it was not clear that the Learjet was  
covered by the order or whether it had undergone the repair. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't totally understand it,'' he said. ``Before we address  
that, we're going to make sure we know what we're talking about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA also limited planes to an altitude of 41,000 feet until  
the valves were replaced because of the possibility they could 
fail. 
</P>
<P>
	In the plane's last radio transmission above Gainesville, Fla.,  
the pilot was instructed to climb to 39,000 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	The 23-year-old, eight-passenger plane had logged more than  
10,000 hours of flight time but had no history of serious 
mechanical problems, according to the FAA. 
</P>
<P>
	The twin-engine jet was operated by Sunjet Aviation Inc. Company  
President James Watkins said the plane had been inspected before it 
took off and four other times in the past week. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart, 42, with his knickers and tam-o'-shanter hat, was one  
of the world's most recognizable golfers. He won 18 tournaments, 
including two U.S. Open titles. He also was part of the team that 
helped the United States stage a historic comeback to beat Europe 
last month for the Ryder Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart and his wife, Tracey, had two children, ages 10 and 13.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's an irreplaceable guy,'' fellow golfer Duffy Waldorf said.  
``I think of Payne Stewart and there's a guy that's going to be 
like Jack Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer, a guy you want around all 
those years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also killed were Stewart's agents, Robert Fraley and Van Ardan,  
and the two pilots, Michael Kling, 43, and Stephanie Bellegarrigue, 
27. Bruce Borland, 40, one of Nicklaus' golf course designers, was 
also believed to have been on the plane. 
</P>
<P>
	Kling had flown approximately 4,000 hours, however, Francis said  
only 37 of those were in a Learjet. He became eligible to fly the 
Learjet a month ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Bellegarrigue had between 1,000 and 2,000 hours, Francis said.  
It was not clear how many hours were in a Learjet.

</P>
<P>
	HELENA, Mont. (AP) -- Hoyt Axton, a folksy baritone, songwriter  
and actor who wrote Three Dog Night's No. 1 hit ``Joy to the 
World'' and songs that were performed by artists from Elvis Presley 
to Ringo Starr, died Tuesday after suffering a heart attack two 
weeks ago and another during surgery. He was 61. 
</P>
<P>
	Axton's mother, Mae Boren Axton, had her own spot in popular  
culture history as the co-author of Presley's ``Heartbreak Hotel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Three Dog Night's recording of his novelty ``Joy to the World''  
(``Jeremiah was a bullfrog ...'') was on top of the charts for six 
straight weeks in 1971, making it the top hit of the year. Axton 
pitched the song to group members when he was their opening act in 
1969-70. He also wrote ``Never Been to Spain'' for the band, a song 
also recorded by Presley. 
</P>
<P>
	Axton's own singing hits include ``Boney Fingers'' (``Work your  
fingers to the bone, what do you get? Boney fingers'') and ``When 
the Morning Comes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A large man, Axton as an actor specialized in playing good ol'  
boys on TV and in films, including ``Gremlins'' and ``The Black 
Stallion.''

<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Michael Baring, a leading member of the British  
banking dynasty brought down by a rogue trader in 1995, died Oct. 
15, according to the ING Group, which took over the bankrupt 
Barings bank. He was 50. 
</P>
<P>
	News reports said he suffered a heart attack.  
</P>
<P>
	Baring played a key role in trying to steady nerves when a  
Singapore-based British trader, Nick Leeson, brought down the bank 
with bad bets on financial markets. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, Baring -- great-great-grandson of Sir Francis  
Baring, who founded the banking dynasty in the 18th century -- was 
head of international marketing at the bank. 
</P>
<P>
	He transferred to ING when the Dutch group bought the bank for  
$1.60 and took over its debts of some $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	His most recent appointment was head of a division responsible  
for ING Barings' relationships with clients and partners worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	He began work at Barings in a job in the mailroom, before  
becoming a trader.

and a man who served on everything from the Boy Scouts to the 
Kansas Board of Regents, died Wednesday. He was 86. 
</P>
<P>
	Caldwell served eight years on the Salina City Commission,  
including three terms as mayor. He served a term in the state 
Legislature. He was active in the National Association for the 
Advancement of Colored People and served on the Kansas Board of 
Regents.

<P>
	GUATEMALA CITY (AP) -- Guatemalan former vice president Arturo  
Herbruger Asturias, founder of an organization that oversaw the 
country's return to democracy after a failed coup, died Monday. He 
was 87 and had diabetes and bronchial pneumonia. 
</P>
<P>
	Herbruger established the Supreme Electoral Tribunal in 1983,  
the organization that presided over elections for the National 
Constitutional Assembly in 1984 and presidential elections in 1985 
and 1990. He headed the tribunal until 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	After the failure of an attempted coup on May 25, 1993, against  
then-President Jorge Serrano Elias, the Congress designated Ramiro 
de Leon Carpio as president and Herbruger as vice president, to 
serve until January 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time of his death, Herbruger was serving as a  
representative of the Central American Parliament, made up of 120 
representatives from Guatemala, Honduras, Panama, Nicaragua, El 
Salvador and the Dominican Republic. 
</P>
<P>
	Herbruger was considered a brilliant lawyer who also at one time  
served as president of the country's supreme court, as attorney 
general, and as treasury minister.

<P>
	GRAND ISLAND, Neb. (AP) -- Wesley C. Mues, a Nebraska State Court  
of Appeals judge who once acted as special counsel in impeachment 
proceedings against a former attorney general, died Monday night in 
a traffic accident. He was 51. 
</P>
<P>
	He died after his pickup truck collided nearly head on with  
another pickup truck on U.S. Highway 281, just south of Interstate 
80. 
</P>
<P>
	Mues, who joined the appeals court in 1994, was appointed  
special counsel for the state in the impeachment proceedings 
against then-Attorney General Paul Douglas. 
</P>
<P>
	Douglas was impeached by the Legislature in 1984, partly over  
his conduct in office and personal dealings with a former officer 
of the failed Commonwealth Savings Co. in Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
	Douglas was acquitted by the state Supreme Court before being  
convicted of perjury by a county court jury in Lincoln on Dec. 14, 
1984. He resigned 12 days later, only to see his perjury conviction 
later overturned by the state Supreme Court.

<HEADLINE> LA School Districts May Be Split </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The city's embattled school superintendent  
unveiled a plan Tuesday to divide the nation's second-largest 
school district into 12 mini-districts and place the district's 
newly appointed chief executive officer in charge of the 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	The mini-districts would be semi-autonomous, each one led by an  
assistant superintendent elected by the community. Each district 
would have control of its budget, instruction, personnel and health 
divisions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I very strongly believe in this concept. It's what the board  
has been talking about. Actually, I'm carrying out the directive -- 
they want me to be the visionary, they want me to be creative,'' 
said superintendent Ruben Zacarias. 
</P>
<P>
	His proposal comes at a time when he has been under intense  
scrutiny by the Board of Education for his management. 
</P>
<P>
	He said it has been in the works for about a month, before board  
members voted in closed session Oct. 12 to remove him from 
day-to-day decision making and hire Henry Miller to fill the newly 
created CEO position. The board also ordered all district employees 
to report to Miller, a former board member, who in turn reports to 
Zacarias. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Zacarias' proposal, Miller would be in charge of the  
district's capital assets and facilities services, overseeing 
construction and environmental health and safety issues.

<HEADLINE> Bush Tells Teens About Abstinence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORANGE CITY, Iowa (AP) -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush, confessing  
``I have made wrong choices,'' urged high school students Tuesday 
to practice sexual abstinence. 
</P>
<P>
	``Abstinence is a sure-fire program,'' said Bush, the  
front-runner for the GOP presidential nomination. ``Abstinence is 
not just about children, it's about health.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Bush lectured the students to avoid sex, he also was  
questioned about mistakes he had made and recounted a drunken 
college outing. 
</P>
<P>
	``The mistake was drinking too much and thinking I was  
invisible,'' Bush said. ``The consequence was being told by someone 
in authority ... I broke the law.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There have been repeated suggestions of improprieties in Bush's  
early life, and he has admitted to making poor choices without 
offering details. He told a story of getting drunk and stealing a 
Christmas wreath while in college, calling it ``a prank.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The ultimate consequence is I don't drink any more,'' said  
Bush, who used the speech to about 800 high school students to seek 
the moral high ground. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it is important for the Baby Boomer generation, which  
I am proud to be part of, to share wisdom from what we have 
learned,'' he said. ``I have made wrong choices in life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush also was seeking to bolster his credentials with social  
conservatives leery of his views on abortion. Bush argues that he 
takes an anti-abortion stand, but has said he wouldn't apply litmus 
tests to judges he appoints and has said the nation isn't ready for 
a constitutional amendment banning abortion. 
</P>
<P>
	Those positions have drawn fire from more conservative rivals,  
and Bush was focusing on the issue in his latest Iowa campaign 
swing. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Bush argued for an expansion of federally funded  
abstinence promotion programs until they are funded at the same 
level as other birth control programs, such as contraceptive 
distributions. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said he'd expand a provision of the welfare reform law  
to allow religious organizations to compete for federal money. He 
said he chose the high school for Tuesday's speech because it has a 
strong ``right choices'' program. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush also was visiting a crisis pregnancy center during his  
latest campaign swing in the state where precinct caucuses next 
January launch the nominating process. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to abstinence funding, Bush said he would push for  
better adoption laws, and stressed his backing for parental 
notification laws. 
</P>
<P>
	Meeting with reporters, he dismissed suggestions that he was  
seeking to ease worries about his abortion views. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got a record on that,'' said Bush.  
</P>
<P>
	He also dismissed questions from reporters about new polls  
suggesting Democrats may be gaining in potential matchups against 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's too early to be talking about the general  
election,'' said Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the day, Bush focused on illegal immigration, arguing  
for tough enforcement while conceding he understands why many in 
Mexico seek to come to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``Family values do not stop at the Rio Grande,'' said Bush.  
``They're hungry and they're going to come and try to find work. 
That's a powerful instinct.''

<HEADLINE> Primeau To Play for Canadian Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- All-star Keith Primeau will be skating  
again, but not for the Carolina Hurricanes. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of waiting to be traded or for a break in contract  
negotiations, Primeau will leave the NHL and join the Canadian 
national team, his agent said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Primeau, the 27-year-old former team captain who played in  
Hartford, Conn., before the team moved to North Carolina, became a 
restricted free agent this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Contract negotiations stalled after Primeau decided to not take  
an offer to stay with Carolina the next two years for $6 million. 
He has not played with the team this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``They said the only way Keith will play for us is if he plays  
at $3 million and we are not trading Keith Primeau, so he can sit 
at home all year,'' Primeau's agent, Todd Reynolds, said in a 
telephone interview from Toronto. ``If he's going to do that, then 
he has to start playing hockey, and that's why he's going to be 
joining the national team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carolina general manager Jim Rutherford believes the offers have  
been fair. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've played a risky game when you withhold your services,''  
Rutherford said. ``What they hope for is we're going to change our 
position, but we've made it clear all along that we're not going 
to. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a business to run here, and we've set what we think  
what Keith Primeau is worth to our franchise, and there is nobody 
else in the league that has told me what we should be paying him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reynolds said Primeau's playing for the national team isn't  
intended to force Carolina to trade him. 
</P>
<P>
	``The point is to stay in game shape, and it doesn't benefit  
anyone for Keith to play for the national team -- really, except for 
himself,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Primeau probably will join the Canadian team in a week at no  
salary, Reynolds said. The national team, which competes in 
international events such as the Olympics and World Championships, 
is now playing in England. 
</P>
<P>
	Primeau and his family will move to Calgary, Alberta, where the  
national team is based. 
</P>
<P>
	Reynolds said the Canadian team extended Primeau an open  
invitation about a month ago, and Primeau joined it to stay in 
shape while awaiting contract developments. 
</P>
<P>
	``He can play for the national team for a day, for a month or  
for a whole year,'' Reynolds said. ``He would rather play for an 
NHL team, of course.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under the rules for a restricted free agent, Primeau would have  
to be traded by Carolina or signed to an offer sheet to play for 
another NHL team this season. Otherwise, he will have to wait four 
years until his free agency expires to be signed by another team. 
</P>
<P>
	Reynolds said waiting four years is possible, but Primeau would  
rather be playing for another team. 
</P>
<P>
	``He wants to play,'' Reynolds said. ``He wants to get a fresh  
team and a team that is willing to pay what he is worth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rutherford has said that if Primeau signs an offer sheet with  
another NHL team, the team would match it. But Primeau has received 
no offer sheet since becoming a restricted free agent July 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Primeau rejected a five-year, $20 million offer this past summer  
because the deal would have taken him one year past when he could 
be unrestricted. Then he turned down a two-year, $7 million deal. 
</P>
<P>
	When he rejected that offer, the Hurricanes stripped him of his  
team captaincy and reduced the offer to two years for $6 million.

<HEADLINE> Internet Revenues Near $500 Billion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Revenues for Internet-related businesses are  
projected to rise more than 67 percent this year to $507 billion, 
according to a study financed by one of the industry's giants. 
</P>
<P>
	With the increase over $301 billion in revenues in 1998, those  
businesses now account for 2.3 million jobs, according to the study 
by the Center for Research on Electronic Commerce at the University 
of Texas in Austin. 
</P>
<P>
	The study, funded by Cisco Systems Inc., the $12.1 billion  
computer networking company, included both those running the 
Internet -- such as computer hardware and software companies -- as 
well as those selling products over the network. Cisco provided the 
study to news organizations for publication Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	If the nation's Internet economy were to grow at even half its  
current rate the next three years, it would generate $1.2 trillion 
in revenues in 2002, the study said. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues among U.S. companies selling products over the Internet  
have more than doubled to an estimated $170 billion since last 
year, the study said. Those companies also have created 394,000 
Internet-related jobs in the past year, employing a total of nearly 
901,000 workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Remaining revenues and jobs came from companies that create  
hardware or software, support the Internet's infrastructure or act 
as intermediaries for digital transactions, such as online travel 
agents or brokerages. 
</P>
<P>
	The total Internet-related revenue of $507 billion is about 6  
percent of the nation's gross domestic product -- the broadest 
measure of economic health. 
</P>
<P>
	The study said the bulk of the economic and job growth is being  
driven by small businesses, with the largest 10 companies 
accounting for only 27 percent of all Internet revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	The university said it compiled the study's results by looking  
at 3,400 U.S. companies, with a total of 305,000 employees, that 
generate all or part of their revenues from Internet products or 
services. Some of the information was amassed using reports from 
research companies, financial reports and the Web sites for 300 of 
the largest companies.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Deemed Not Ready for Quakes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- The ability of the United States to respond to  
major earthquakes in its cities is hindered by an out-of-date 
network of seismic instruments, according to geology experts. 
</P>
<P>
	In contrast, a new digital seismic network in Taiwan alerted  
officials to the scope of its magnitude 7.2 earthquake on Sept. 21 
while the ground was still shaking. 
</P>
<P>
	Geologists who met in Denver on Tuesday for the annual  
convention of the Geological Society of America said Southern 
California is beginning to install digital monitoring equipment 
along some of the most notorious quake-prone faults that crisscross 
the region's underbelly. 
</P>
<P>
	The upgrade was prompted by the Northridge earthquake in 1994  
that killed 57 people and caused more than $20 billion in damage. 
</P>
<P>
	But similar monitors are not yet being installed around San  
Francisco, where geologists predict a 70 percent chance of a major 
earthquake occurring within the next 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, most of the country is monitored by arrays of  
mechanical monitors that read a variety of seismic waves generated 
by earthquakes. The information is relayed to computers for 
analysis, but the digital systems use computerized sensors that are 
faster and more accurate. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists said communities typically wait until after a natural  
disaster -- what they describe as the ``teaching moment'' -- to make 
improvements. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it wasn't for the Northridge earthquake, Los Angeles  
probably wouldn't have any of the technology in place,'' said Mary 
Lou Zoback, chief scientist of the Western Earthquake Hazards Team 
for the U.S. Geological Survey. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress is considering authorizing $170 million to install a  
digital network in quake-prone cities across the United States, 
including the Pacific Northwest and the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure has been approved by the House of Representatives.  
Even if it wins Senate support, the entire network would not be in 
place for another five years or more, scientists said. 
</P>
<P>
	Following the 1995 earthquake in Kobe, Japan that killed 6,000  
and caused $100 billion in damage, Japan and Taiwan installed dense 
arrays of digital seismic monitors in their countries. 
</P>
<P>
	The monitors cannot prevent damage by themselves, but provide  
public safety officials with a near-instant reports of where an 
earthquake is most severe, or if less-severe shaking is occurring 
in an unstable area prone of landslides.

<HEADLINE> Extremist Cleared for NYC Marathon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The New York City Marathon won't ban the head of  
Austria's right-wing Freedom Party from running or change the route 
for next month's race. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite outrage by community leaders in Brooklyn, Joerg Haider,  
the son of a Nazi party member who has praised an elite guard of 
the Nazi Party, will be allowed to race. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not going to kick him out of the race,'' Allan  
Steinfeld, president of the New York Road Runners Club and race 
director of the New York City Marathon, said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't discriminate,'' Steinfeld added. ``The only  
requirements for entry into the marathon are that the person be 18 
years of age, attest to his or her physical fitness, and pay the 
entry fee.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 49-year-old lawyer has been approved to wear the number 5777  
in the 30th running of the marathon on Nov. 7 through the city's 
five boroughs. 
</P>
<P>
	Haider's electoral success has alarmed Israel and neighboring  
countries because of his comments years ago in praise of Hitler's 
``decent employment policies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``His type of ugliness does not belong on the streets of  
Brooklyn, where many survivors have taken up residence after the 
Holocaust,'' Assemblyman Dov Hikind of Brooklyn said. ``Brooklyn 
will not stand by and be silent in the face of his treachery.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Isaac Abraham, a spokesman for Brooklyn's large Hasidic  
community, wrote to the marathon organizers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I plead with them to show sensitivity and respect for the  
neighborhood by canceling Mr. Haider's application,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Vote Postponed on Minority Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- A council of 80 representatives from Fortune 500  
companies postponed a decision Tuesday on whether to loosen the 
definition of minority-owned businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	For the past 27 years, the National Minority Supplier  
Development Council has required 51 percent minority ownership for 
a company to be certified as ``minority-owned.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The rule change delayed Tuesday would have lowered the  
requirement to 30 percent for publicly traded companies on a 
case-by-case basis. Only firms already certified as minority-owned 
would be eligible for the lower requirement. 
</P>
<P>
	The council -- comprised of 3,500 corporate members nationwide --  
sees the change as a way to help minority-owned businesses attract 
capital and grow big enough to compete with other large national 
suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
	Many corporations try to buy a portion of their goods from  
minority-owned businesses, either voluntarily or to comply with 
government requirements. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed change has divided minority groups. Supporters say  
the lower requirement is needed for minority-owned companies to 
grow, but opponents argue the rule change would favor big companies 
at the expense of small ones. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce praised the  
decision to delay the vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're estatic. We would have opposed the requirement change,''  
said Chamber of Commerce chairman Ray Arvizu. ``It is too vague 
what the overall impact would be (of the change) and a lot of 
businesses were not at the table.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the U.S Hispanic Chamber of Commmerce opposed the  
proposal, other groups such as the National Association of Black 
Auto Suppliers have supported it, saying businesses need capital to 
grow.

<HEADLINE> Internet Name Provider Can't Be Sued </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A company that registers Internet domain  
names can't be sued for approving the name of a ``cybersquatter'' 
that violates another firm's trademark, a federal appeals court 
ruled Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Network Solutions Inc., the principal registrar of names ending  
in .com, doesn't control or monitor the millions of names it 
approves and is not legally responsible when the approval results 
in a trademark infringement, said the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of 
Appeals. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling recognizes the need for speedy, high-volume  
registrations of domain names, said Ronald L. Johnston, lawyer for 
Network Solutions. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike the government office that takes a year or more to review  
and approve trademarks, ``Network Solutions doesn't review the 
names that people are trying to register,'' Johnston said. ``This 
is critical to the growth of the commercial Internet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This is the latest of several recent rulings on cybersquatters,  
who take advantage of first-come, first-served Internet domain 
registration by claiming prominent names in hopes of getting 
companies to pay large sums for them. The court, which oversees 
federal courts in California and eight other Western states, has 
generally rejected major companies' claims of broad legal rights to 
protect their trademarks. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's case involved a suit by Lockheed Martin Corp., whose  
well-known Skunk Works laboratory in Palmdale designs aircraft for 
the government. Network Solutions, one of several companies that 
register domain names after screening for duplications, has 
registered a dozen names containing some variation of ``skunk 
works,'' a phrase previously trademarked by Lockheed Martin. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockheed Martin, based in Bethesda, Md., sued Network Solutions  
in 1996 after getting no response to its request to cancel the 
registrations. The suit sought damages for trademark infringement 
and an order barring all such domain names except Lockheed's. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Dean Pregerson of Los Angeles dismissed the  
suit and was upheld by the appeals court in a 3-0 ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	Network Solutions exercises no more control over the domain  
names it registers than the U.S. Postal Services provides when it 
sends mail to a street address, said the opinion by Judge Stephen 
Trott. He said a company accused of taking part in trademark 
infringement is responsible only if it performed ``direct control 
and monitoring'' of the infringing action. 
</P>
<P>
	David Quinto, lawyer for Lockheed Martin, said Network Solutions  
was performing the same role as the trademark office and should be 
judged by the same rules. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not asking NSI to screen every domain name, but once we  
come to NSI and tell them about an infringing domain name, NSI 
should be liable'' for failing to act, he said.

<HEADLINE> Budget Fights Raging on Capitol Hill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Under pressure from within and without,  
Republican leaders decided Tuesday to include congressional 
salaries in the across-the-board spending cut they want to impose 
on federal agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a sign of how serious we are, we will ask more of ourselves  
than we are asking of any government employees,'' House Majority 
Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, said in a statement. ``While we ask 
every government agency to root out waste from its budget, members 
of Congress will not only root out an equal percentage of waste 
from Congress' budget but we will also cut our own pay.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With GOP leaders moving toward seeking a 1 percent  
across-the-board reduction in agency spending, lawmakers' pay -- now 
scheduled to rise 3.4 percent to $141,300 in January -- would 
increase instead to $139,900. 
</P>
<P>
	It is unclear, however, whether legislators' salaries will ever  
be affected. President Clinton has promised to veto the GOP's 
across-the-board spending reduction, arguing it would be too 
damaging to defense, education and other programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to let that happen,'' White House chief of  
staff John Podesta told reporters about the across-the-board cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	Applying the reduction to lawmakers' pay would save less than $1  
million, a tiny fraction of the billions of dollars in dispute 
between Clinton and Congress in their budget fight. 
</P>
<P>
	But with Republicans arguing that federal agencies could afford  
to trim waste from their budgets in the GOP drive to avoid spending 
Social Security surpluses, their initial exclusion of lawmakers' 
own pay had caused them a public relations headache. Criticism had 
come from rank-and-file Republicans, Clinton and radio talk show 
hosts. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has everything to do with leadership by example,'' said  
Rep. J.D. Hayworth, R-Ariz., among those who pushed to include 
members' pay. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans worried that unless legislators' salaries were  
included, labor unions might run advertisements contrasting that 
with the GOP's failure so far this year to raise the minimum wage, 
said John Feehery, spokesman for House Speaker Dennis Hastert, 
R-Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans had been pushing a 1.4 percent reduction in federal  
agencies' spending, a cut that would not affect automatic benefits 
such as Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. On Tuesday, they 
were planning to drop that to a 1 percent cut in hopes of picking 
up support from lawmakers unhappy over reductions to favorite 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP leaders said they had not originally included members' pay  
in the across-the-board cut because the money for their salaries is 
not controlled by the spending bills that finance agencies' 
budgets. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Republicans continued having trouble ensuring their  
plan could pass Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	House Transportation Committee Chairman Bud Shuster, R-Pa., was  
demanding that the across-the-board cut not apply to highway 
programs, and other lawmakers were said to be seeking exemptions 
for other programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're working it, just like anything else,'' said House  
Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, the House GOP's top vote-counter. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans plan to attach the cuts to a $314 billion measure  
financing labor, health and education programs, the biggest and 
last of the 13 annual spending bills for the new fiscal year, which 
began Oct. 1. Also affixed to the bill will be the District of 
Columbia's budget, an earlier version of which Clinton vetoed. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the bill exceeds Clinton's overall demands for education  
spending, the president plans to veto it because of the 
across-the-board cuts and because it provides little of the $1.4 
billion he wants for hiring new teachers. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, House Speaker Dennis Hastert said Republicans and the  
White House are not that far apart on their remaining budget 
disputes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we are that far away now,'' Hastert, R-Ill.,  
said Tuesday in an interview. ``For (President Clinton's) own 
purposes or for political purposes, he may want to stretch this out 
for a long period of time, but I don't know why.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton wants less than $10 billion more than Congress has  
provided for teachers, police, foreign aid, land purchases and 
other programs. He also wants to kill provisions helping oil, 
mining and other industries that the administration considers 
anti-environmental. Republicans, meanwhile, want to give states 
more control over money for schools and other programs than Clinton 
prefers. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, eight of the 13 spending bills for fiscal 2000 have  
become law. Clinton has vetoed three and has yet to act on two 
others.

<HEADLINE> 76ers' Geiger Out 4-6 Weeks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Philadelphia 76ers center Matt Geiger needs  
knee surgery and will be out 4-to-6 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Geiger, who will have arthroscopic surgery Wednesday, is the  
latest 76er to go down with a significant injury before the start 
of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Theo Ratliff will be out two more weeks with a stress fracture  
in his leg, while Tyrone Hill has a fractured thumb and Allen 
Iverson a sore knee. 
</P>
<P>
	Stanley Roberts, signed last week to help the team's depleted  
front line, will start the season on the injured list while he 
recovers from shoulder surgery. Korleone Young, who was not 
expected to make the team, is recovering from a cervical sprain in 
his neck suffered two weeks ago -- when he was mugged. 
</P>
<P>
	Geiger averaged 13.5 points and 7.2 rebounds last season, second  
and third on the team in each category. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm kind of scared, I admit that,'' Geiger said. ``I'm trying  
not to get frustrated, but I definitely am. I know the last thing 
this team needs, with all the injuries we have, is for me to go 
down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Geiger will have loose particles removed from his knee by team  
doctor Jack McPhilemy, who has been the busiest man in the 
organization in the preseason. An MRI on Tuesday showed no 
structural damage, said team spokesman Bill Bonsiewicz. 
</P>
<P>
	Rookie Todd MacCulloch, a second-round draft pick who has been  
impressive in exhibition games, is the likely replacement for 
Geiger at center.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Fall / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo share prices fell sharply Wednesday morning  
as investors were discouraged by the dollar's weakening against the 
yen and a decline on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 310.96 points,  
or 1.76 percent, to 17,360.83 at the end of the morning session. On 
Tuesday, the average closed up 23.0 points, or 0.13 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 104.08 yen at late morning, down 1.06 yen from  
late Tuesday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level of 
104.69 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	In stock trading, prices started lower following Tuesday's  
moderate decline in New York, where the Dow Jones industrial 
average lost 47.80 points, or 0.5 percent, to 10,302.13. That fall 
came on worries about rising inflation in the U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The morning decline in Tokyo was led by sharp drops in  
export-oriented issues, including high-technology shares, and bank 
shares. 
</P>
<P>
	Exporters are particularly vulnerable to the stronger yen, as it  
can reduce dollar-denominated earnings of Japanese companies when 
translated into the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Kosaku Inagaki, general manager at Nippon Global Securities,  
said stock prices have also been pressured by the fall in the 
Standard and Poor's 500 U.S. stock index futures in Asia. The 
decline indicates the U.S. stock market may open lower later in the 
global day. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was down 18.49 points, or 1.20 percent, to 1,524.60. 
The TOPIX closed up 8.82 points, or 0.57 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar moved lower against the yen  
amid hopes of a larger-than-expected second supplementary budget by 
Japan's government. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said that he  
expects the supplementary budget will be slightly bigger than 
expected. The government plans to submit the package during the 
upcoming parliamentary session beginning later this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Total spending in the package is estimated at between $95.2  
billion and $123.8 billion, according to Japanese news reports. 
</P>
<P>
	Later in the morning session, the dollar extended its losses on  
selling by several U.S. hedge funds, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 110.18 yen, down  
from 111.80 yen late Tuesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond fell  
to 1.8500 percent from Tuesday's finish of 1.8850 percent. Its 
price rose 0.29 point to 99.57.

<HEADLINE> At the Movies: Being John Malkovich </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	If whimsy translated into box-office success, ``Being John  
Malkovich'' would be the year's runaway blockbuster. 
</P>
<P>
	Fabulously funny and delightfully disturbed, ``Being John  
Malkovich'' is the ultimate voyeur movie, a dark and at times 
malevolent take on what it's like to be in someone else's skull, 
looking out. 
</P>
<P>
	Extreme adjectives don't do this film justice. So here's a  
staccato rundown of the plot: 
</P>
<P>
	Puppeteer takes file clerk job. Puppeteer finds tunnel behind  
file cabinet, crawls through. Puppeteer is sucked into mind of John 
Malkovich. Puppeteer drops out of sky along Jersey Turnpike 15 
minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
	After that, ``Being John Malkovich'' gets really weird.  
</P>
<P>
	The film stars John Cusack as puppeteer Craig Schwartz, Cameron  
Diaz as his pet-shop keeper wife, Lotte, Malkovich as Malkovich, 
and Catherine Keener as Maxine, the beautiful romantic interest for 
all three. 
</P>
<P>
	Craig lives for his puppeteering craft but can't make a living  
with his performances on the streets of New York. With Lotte doting 
over a chimpanzee, an iguana and a menagerie of other pets in their 
apartment, Craig's marriage is unfulfilling. 
</P>
<P>
	When he takes a clerical job on an office building's 7 1/2th floor  
-- with literally low overhead in its 5-foot, 3-inch ceilings -- he 
becomes enamored of Maxine, who rebuffs him with an icy cut: 
``You're not someone I could get interested in, Craig. You play 
with dolls.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maxine changes her mind, however, once Craig discovers a portal  
into the actor's mind, allowing people to experience all things 
Malkovich for brief interludes. Craig, Maxine and eventually Lotte, 
who also becomes smitten with Maxine, use their entry into 
Malkovich's body and soul to their own advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	For Maxine and Lotte, the notion of being John Malkovich offers  
a chance to live out gender-bending sexual desires. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do you have any idea what it's like to have two people look at  
you with total lust and devotion through the same pair of eyes?'' 
Maxine asks. 
</P>
<P>
	For Craig, being John Malkovich is a shot at the ultimate  
puppeteering gig as he gradually applies his talent to making 
Malkovich do his bidding. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just a matter of practice before Malkovich is just  
another puppet hanging next to my work table,'' Craig proclaims. 
</P>
<P>
	Early on, Craig wrestles with the philosophical implications of  
being John Malkovich. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do you see what a metaphysical can of worms this portal is?''  
he asks Maxine. 
</P>
<P>
	Pragmatic, Maxine replies: ``We'll sell tickets. Tickets to  
Malkovich.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, everyone gets a piece of Malkovich, including a band  
of old folks led by Orson Bean, who as Craig's centenarian boss has 
his own nefarious designs on the actor. 
</P>
<P>
	Malkovich himself gets a taste of what being John Malkovich  
means. In a surreal scene, the actor passes through the portal into 
a nightmare world peopled by Malkoviches, and every word spoken has 
three syllables: Mal-ko-vich. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a testament to outlandishness that screenwriter Charlie  
Kaufman could dream up such a premise and actually see it land in 
theaters. It's an absurdist's delight that first-time director 
Spike Jonze, a music-video veteran, could execute it so cleverly. 
And it's an audacious bit of self-immolation that Malkovich was 
willing to play victim to identity rape and put himself on the line 
in such a warped way. 
</P>
<P>
	The cast is superb. Cusack combines brooding scruffiness with  
almost evil earnestness as he realizes he may finally live the life 
he wants by co-opting someone else's. Diaz is sweetly hapless and 
nearly unrecognizable under a mop of frizzy brunette hair. Keener 
is beguilingly mean and self-assured. 
</P>
<P>
	And Malkovich is, well, Malkovich, reacting with believable  
anger, curiosity and terror to an unbelievably grotesque situation. 
</P>
<P>
	The film features a handful of nice cameos by actors playing  
themselves, commenting on the strange twists Malkovich's sexual and 
professional life take. 
</P>
<P>
	As funny and fresh as ``Being John Malkovich'' is on the  
surface, somber themes of bitter envy, vicious vanity and theft of 
self burble throughout. The characters have no moral compunctions 
about insinuating themselves into someone else's persona, squashing 
another person's soul to make room for their own. 
</P>
<P>
	Consequences are ambiguous. There is punishment for at least one  
of the guilty, reward for others. There is torment for the 
guiltless, and the implication of future suffering for the truly 
innocent. 
</P>
<P>
	In its uncertain morality, ``Being John Malkovich'' is kind of  
like being human. 
</P>
<P>
	``Being John Malkovich'' is distributed by USA Films and is  
rated R.

<HEADLINE> French Threaten British Food Block </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Angry French farmers on Tuesday urged a boycott of  
British food in a further escalation of the conflict over France's 
refusal to lift a ban on British beef. 
</P>
<P>
	Luc Guyau, president of the National Federation of Agricultural  
Unions, said French farmers would respond in kind if British 
farmers carry out their threat to boycott French food. 
</P>
<P>
	The heart of the dispute is food safety and France's refusal to  
lift its ban on British beef despite an European Union decision 
rescinding a worldwide ban imposed in 1996 as a result of the mad 
cow crisis. Evidence has linked the bovine disease with a fatal 
human brain condition, Creutzfeldt-Jakob. 
</P>
<P>
	Britain argues that a report submitted by the French to the EU  
to justify its refusal to adhere to the lifting of the ban presents 
no new evidence that British beef is unsafe. Britain wants the EU 
to take retaliatory measures against France. 
</P>
<P>
	An EU report Friday that accused French animal feed plants of  
violating European safety regulations by using prohibited 
substances, including sewage waste, in the preparation of cattle 
feed has further angered British farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	``If tomorrow England pushes things to the extreme'' and decides  
to go ahead with a ``total boycott of all French agricultural and 
food products, I would simply say one thing. England is an island. 
An island is easier to blockade than a continent,'' Guyau said.

<HEADLINE> Cisco Using Wireless Standard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Cisco Systems Inc. said Tuesday that 10  
companies -- including Motorola Inc. and Texas Instruments -- will 
develop products using its proposed standard for broadband wireless 
Internet services, a new technology aimed at making cordless 
connections to the Internet cheaper and more reliable. 
</P>
<P>
	The San Jose-based computer networking company is hoping to line  
up more support for the new technology to bring the price down. 
</P>
<P>
	Cisco hopes to roll out products using the new technology by the  
end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	At the core of the coalition is the technology called Vector  
Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing -- which Cisco says 
delivers two-way data, voice and video communications over the air 
with speed and quality comparable to today's cable networks. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies, which also include Irvine, Calif.-based Broadcom  
Corp. and San Jose-based Samsung Telecommunications of America Inc, 
have agreed to build products with silicon chips using the VOFDM 
standard in an attempt to jump-start the nascent market for 
high-speed wireless services. 
</P>
<P>
	Broadcom will work with Cisco to develop a wireless modem that  
allows data transmission speeds of 40 million bits per second while 
sending or receiving data.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon Wouldn't Shoot Down Plane </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- During the flight of Payne Stewart's Learjet,  
the senior military officer involved in monitoring its course 
consulted the Defense Department's written guidance for the 
destruction of uncontrolled airborne objects, a Pentagon official 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon also said that shortly before  
the Learjet crashed Monday, an officer on the Joint Staff at the 
Pentagon raised the question of what actions the military might be 
asked to take if the business jet were to suddenly veer from its 
steady northerly course. 
</P>
<P>
	Bacon said the question may have been raised by Navy Vice Adm.  
Scott A. Fry, the Joint Staff director of operations, who was 
monitoring the Learjet's path on radar in the National Military 
Command Center in the Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
	``Admiral Fry or someone working with him said, 'You know, if  
this thing suddenly veers off course and heads to Chicago, we'll 
have some really tough decisions to make.' It was that type of 
thinking,'' Bacon said. ``It was not saying, 'OK, let's get ready.' 
It never got to that point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several unarmed Air Force and Air National Guard fighter jets  
were directed toward the plane to observe and try to establish 
radio contact. Bacon said Tuesday that near the end of the drama, 
two armed Air Force F-16 air defense jets from Fargo, N.D., were 
sent aloft briefly but did not reach the Learjet before it crashed. 
The Fargo F-16s were capable of firing their 20mm cannons but were 
not armed with air-to-air missiles, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bacon said the determination was made early in the Learjet's  
1,400-mile flight that it was headed toward a sparsely populated 
region and therefore no drastic actions would be required. 
</P>
<P>
	The spokesman said there are no written Pentagon instructions  
for destroying a manned civilian aircraft in flight. He said 
extreme measures were not even a theoretical consideration until 
the Learjet neared the point when military officers calculated it 
was about to run out of fuel. 
</P>
<P>
	Bacon said he reviewed the sequence of events in a telephone  
conversation Tuesday with Navy Vice Adm. Herb Browne, the deputy 
commander in chief of U.S. Space Command at Peterson Air Force 
Base, Colo., who was in charge because the space commander, Air 
Force Gen. Richard Myers, was at the Pentagon. Using radars, 
satellites and other means, Space Command tracks all objects in 
U.S. airspace and in outer space. 
</P>
<P>
	``As they reached the point where they figured the plane was  
running out of fuel, in the next half an hour to an hour, obviously 
the question of what do we do if it veers off course became more 
urgent than it was early on in the operation,'' Bacon said. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the things Admiral Browne did was check the Joint Staff  
regulations that deal with destruction of derelict airborne objects 
to find out what was required. But the conversations about action 
to take never really went beyond the sort of `what-if' that I gave 
you. You know, `what if' it suddenly veers off course, then we'll 
have really tough decisions to make. Those decisions were not 
made.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The regulation Bacon referred to, dated July 31, 1997, is titled  
``Instructions for Destruction of Derelict Airborne Objects.'' It 
cites as examples unmanned balloons, moored balloons, kites or 
unmanned nonnuclear rockets or missiles. There is no specific 
reference to aircraft, civilian or otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
	The language most relevant to Monday's incident says, ``For  
unmanned derelict airborne objects that become a hazard to domestic 
air navigation or a threat to domestic ground facilities or public 
safety, military personnel may be required to perform surveillance 
and-or destroy the unmanned derelict airborne objects.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The regulation requires that the secretary of defense approve  
any request for destroying airborne objects over U.S. or 
international airspace. Bacon said that if the object were a 
civilian plane the president would have to be notified.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Neil Austrian, who has been president of the NFL

<HEADLINE> World Series National Ratings Jump </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Although the Atlanta Braves haven't done much  
better than the San Diego Padres did last year after two games of 
the World Series, television ratings have improved. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC posted a 14.6 national average and a 24 share for the first  
two games, up 17 percent from last year's 12.5/22. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year's World Series was the lowest-rated ever with a 14.1.  
</P>
<P>
	The 1996 World Series, which also featured the Braves against  
the New York Yankees, earned a 14.9/24 for the first two games. 
However, that series was delayed one day because of rain and the 
games were played on Sunday and Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday's Game 1 had a 14.2/26, up 15 percent from last season.  
Saturday night does not typically draw high television ratings 
because many people go out at night. 
</P>
<P>
	Game 2, on Sunday night, posted a 15.0/23, up 19 percent from  
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	According to NBC, more than 48 million viewers watched the first  
game and more than 53 million saw Game 2. 
</P>
<P>
	The rating is the percentage of television households in the  
nation tuned to a program. Each ratings point represents about 1 
million households. Share represents the percentage of sets tuned 
to the show.

<HEADLINE> Distress Call Came in Stewart Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The distress call came shortly after 10 a.m. from an FAA worker:  
Air Force Staff Sgt. James Hicks was being asked for help in 
tracking the odd flight of a Learjet in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	The twin-engine aircraft had left Orlando, Fla., less than hour  
earlier and things had turned very strange. The jet was flying 
erratically. The pilot did not answer radio transmissions. Could 
Hicks, from his post at Eglin Air Force Base in northern Florida, 
send a F-16 to check it out? 
</P>
<P>
	Hicks didn't know U.S. Open champion Payne Stewart and several  
others were on board Monday. Neither did Capt. Chris Hamilton, who 
was immediately pulled off maneuvers over the Gulf of Mexico and 
ordered to give chase. 
</P>
<P>
	The end came four hours, six states and 1,400 miles later when a  
chartered jet with iced-over windows and apparently no one at the 
wheel, nose-dived into a South Dakota field. There were no 
survivors. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton had to stop for fuel, so it took 50 minutes to close  
the Learjet's 100-mile lead. They were over Memphis, Tenn. And once 
the Air Force pilot got a clear look at the smaller craft, his 
heart dropped. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a very helpless feeling to pull up alongside another  
aircraft and realize the people inside ... are unconscious or in 
some other way incapacitated,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The windows had iced over and Hamilton could see nothing. The  
plane didn't have a mark on it, he said. There was nothing he could 
do. He could not make radio contact and he could not make eye 
contact. 
</P>
<P>
	And he was running low on fuel. He was told to land at Scott Air  
Force Base in Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart, his agents Robert Fraley and Van Ardan, and pilots  
Stephanie Bellegarrigue and Michael Klieg were headed for Dallas' 
Love Field, where Stewart planned to stay for a day and then travel 
to Houston, where he was scheduled to play in Thursday's Tour 
Championship for the top 30 players on the Professional Golfers' 
Association money list. 
</P>
<P>
	There were late reports that golf course designer Bruce Borland  
also was on board. Authorities did not immediately confirm that. 
</P>
<P>
	After Hamilton dropped off at 10:45 a.m., Lt. Col. Mike Hepner  
and Lt. Col. Mike Husted of the Air National Guard picked up the 
Learjet over Kansas and followed its pilotless flight across 
America's heartland. 
</P>
<P>
	The chartered aircraft was flying too slow for the F-16 pilots  
to do any of their normal lifesaving tactics. If the aircrafts' 
speeds had been better matched, the military jets could have rolled 
over and hovered, cockpit-to-cockpit against the smaller craft and 
perhaps have gotten a better look inside. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Guard pilots said Stewart's plane was flying  
straight at 47,000 feet, apparently on autopilot. ``There was never 
any indication that someone was flying the plane,'' said dispatcher 
Lt. Col. Bruce Butters. 
</P>
<P>
	Hepner and Husted refueled three times to keep up with the  
smaller plane as they soared across the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
	Aviation experts said everything about the crash pointed to a  
sudden loss of cabin pressure, perhaps caused by a blown door or 
window seal. No mayday went out. Whatever happened was quick and 
unexpected. 
</P>
<P>
	Humans suffer above 10,000 feet. Oxygen is too scarce, as is air  
pressure to force that small amount of oxygen through human lungs. 
</P>
<P>
	In the plane's last radio transmission above Gainesville, Fla.,  
the pilot was instructed to climb to 39,000 feet. At 30,000 feet, 
according to experts, a human can retain consciousness for only 30 
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite their inability to reach the Learjet's occupants, Hepner  
and didn't leave. Then the civilian plane stalled, began to lose 
altitude and plummeted 10,000 feet, the pilots said. Its fuel tank 
was apparently, and finally, empty. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not even in the Gulf War or in Kosovo, nothing compares with  
this day,'' Kansas Air National Guard Col. Rufus Forrest told The 
Wichita Eagle after watching the crash. ``It was a helpless, eerie 
feeling, knowing this was a tragedy just waiting to end. 
</P>
<P>
	``In most military situations, there's a sense of anticipation  
or excitement. This, I can't think of a word for this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Learjet began to descend, at first slowly, then faster,  
finally spiraling below the clouds and into a marshy field not far 
from Mina, in north-central South Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
	``We saw a quick flash, but that's all,'' Forrest said. ``The  
clouds were between us and the ground. We dropped some altitude and 
were able to see the hole in the ground.''

<HEADLINE> Players Deal With Stewart's Death  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- The conditions at Champions Golf Club could not  
have been more glorious Tuesday. The sun was shining, only a trace 
of breeze. The silence was broken only by the rap of a putter on 
the practice green. 
</P>
<P>
	``A dreary day,'' said John Huston, summing up a somber mood as  
the 29 players in the Tour Championship tried to cope with the 
shocking death of U.S. Open champion Payne Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
	Flags were at half-staff. Smiles were hard to find.  
</P>
<P>
	Tiger Woods felt a void when he watched the developments unfold  
on television Monday, the Learjet with Stewart and five others 
aboard flying uncontrolled across the heartland, only a matter of 
time before it plowed into the earth. 
</P>
<P>
	It hit Woods even harder when he flew to Houston that night and  
picked up the pro-am pairing. His tee time was 9 a.m. The slot 
below, which once held Stewart's name, was blank. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was a rude awakening,'' Woods said. ``You think that  
hopefully it was a bad dream, a nightmare ... but unfortunately, it 
came true. It's hard to be believe he's not going to be here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A memorial service for Stewart will be at 11 a.m. Friday at the  
First Baptist Church of Orlando (Fla.). The PGA Tour altered the 
schedule to give players a chance to attend. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tour Championship will begin with 27 holes on Thursday, have  
another 27 holes on Saturday and conclude Sunday with an 18-hole 
round. 
</P>
<P>
	``The tournament should go on,'' Woods said. ``But obviously,  
it's not going to be an easy week. It's going to be tough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It clearly wasn't an easy day.  
</P>
<P>
	While the pro-am was canceled, 22 players kept their date with  
four amateur partners. It was a form of therapy for some, although 
they played with no emotion and even less focus. Stewart, his quick 
wit, loose swing and colorful knickers, was never far from their 
minds. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm walking down the fairway and occasionally I get a few  
flashes in my head of Payne and some of the memories I have,'' 
Woods said. ``Everyone is going through that. It is just a matter 
of dealing with it and coming to the peace and understand that he 
is in a better place right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Tour Championship is one of the best events of the year, a  
festive atmosphere for the top 30 players on the money list. While 
Champions is only a mile from one of the busiest thoroughfares in 
Houston, the silence was spooky. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody was really asking for autographs or clamoring for  
pictures,'' Woods said. ``Nobody was talking. It was very eerie. 
This golf tournament ... it doesn't have the same emphasis as it 
once did, and rightfully so.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among those who hadn't arrived was Davis Love III, whose father  
was killed in a plane crash in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our entire family knows the grief the Stewart family is  
enduring,'' he said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Phil Mickelson, who finished one stroke behind Stewart in the  
U.S. Open, showed up before dawn for morning television shows and 
returned to the course in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	``For this to happen at the height of his career, and really the  
height of his life, is difficult to accept,'' Mickelson said. ``I 
haven't really thought about the tournament this week or playing. 
It's just a real somber mood here. 
</P>
<P>
	``As far as golf is concerned, it really takes a seat on the  
back burner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart will not be replaced in the field.  
</P>
<P>
	Woods, who won for the sixth time this year at Disney World on  
Sunday, has a chance to surpass $6 million if he wins the next two 
tournaments, although that was not even a consideration on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	He will be paired with David Duval, No. 2 on the money list, for  
the first time this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Big deal.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think it will be difficult to be focused on what you're  
doing,'' Duval said. ``I don't know how spectacular the golf will 
be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duval was among a dozen or so players at Champions on Monday for  
a practice round. Mike Hicks, Stewart's caddie, was stepping off 
the yardage on the course when he was summoned to the phone. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think today was any easier, but yesterday was the  
worst part about it all,'' Duval said. ``I think today was just 
trying to get a grasp of it being real.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The flags were a constant reminder how real it was. If that  
wasn't enough, PGA Tour officials were making black ribbons for 
players and caddies to wear as a tribute to Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to think about playing a tournament,'' Huston said.  
``It doesn't seem worth it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Across the Atlantic Ocean, the American flag flew at half-staff  
at St. Andrews. At the European tour stop in Germany, players were 
in the same frame of mind -- shocked by the tragedy, trying to find 
words to describe a competitor and friend. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods took questions for about 20 minutes, the toughest part of  
his day. 
</P>
<P>
	``To have him gone ... it is really difficult to refer to him  
right now in the past tense,'' he said. ``That's the hardest thing 
for me right now, when I talk about it.''

<HEADLINE> Losses Cost Tulsa Coach His Job </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TULSA, Okla. (AP) -- Last season, Tulsa athletic director Judy  
MacLeod called football coach Dave Rader the ``best fit'' for the 
job. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, she called and told him he was fired.  
</P>
<P>
	Throughout the Western Athletic Conference the news was met with  
the same response: It happens in this business and too bad it 
happened to a guy like Rader. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there's a better man to do a better job in Tulsa, in  
America, I don't know who he is,'' said Rice coach Ken Hatfield, 
whose team leads the WAC and beat the Golden Hurricane 20-10 
earlier this month. ``Nobody's given more love, blood, sweat and 
tears to that program than Dave Rader.'' 
</P>
<P>
	MacLeod said the decision to fire Rader came after the Golden  
Hurricane's 35-21 loss to Hawaii on Saturday ensured the school's 
eighth-straight losing season. Tulsa is 1-6, 0-4 in the WAC. 
</P>
<P>
	The mid-season announcement gives the university time to launch  
a national search and find a replacement as soon as the season 
ends, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	MacLeod said the decision, which came a year after she  
recommended a contract extension, resulted from losses and ``not 
seeing the improvement we needed to see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Texas Christian coach Dennis Franchione said he didn't  
understand the need to fire Rader before the season's end, 
especially after 12 years as coach and his two years as Tulsa's 
starting quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're talking about four more games, maybe a month. Golly, I  
just don't see why a guy can't be able to finish with his team,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Players were stunned by the news.  
</P>
<P>
	``As a team, we believe in coach Rader,'' said freshman  
quarterback Josh Blankenship, a highly touted recruit under Rader 
who made his first collegiate start against Hawaii. ``I'm 
completely numb right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senior wide receiver Damon Savage predicted the news would shake  
up the team. For good or bad, he couldn't say. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know how coach Rader is. He's able to find positive in  
everything,'' Savage said. ``I know he wants to coach us. I know he 
wants to be here in Tulsa. That sort of thing is going to hurt more 
than anything but he's always told us to press on. He wouldn't tell 
us that if he didn't live by it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senior defensive back Spencer Braggs said the change might ``put  
a little spark'' in the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is very unfortunate,'' Braggs said. ``Coach Rader is the  
greatest guy you'll ever meet, but this is a business and wins 
account for more than losses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The dismissal came after weekend discussions involving MacLeod,  
University President Bob Lawless and the private school's board of 
trustees. MacLeod declined to say if Rader was given a chance to 
resign, but said he had no interest in another position with the 
university. 
</P>
<P>
	Rader's last winning season came in 1991, the year Tulsa won the  
Freedom Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Tulsa, with its enrollment of 4,246, demanding academic programs  
and a nearly 70-year-old football stadium, has long struggled 
against better-funded Division I-A opponents. 
</P>
<P>
	MacLeod named defensive coordinator Pat Henderson as Rader's  
interim replacement. 
</P>
<P>
	Fresno State coach Pat Hill said the coaching changes would not  
affect the way his team prepares for this week's game at Skelly 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be a very difficult game for us,'' said Hill,  
who called Rader's firing ``a shame.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We're a team that has to scratch and bite and claw and play  
very, very hard to be successful.''

<HEADLINE> Del La Hoya Gets Favorable Ruling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Boxer Oscar De La Hoya's refusal to answer  
deposition questions about his sexual history was upheld by a judge 
Tuesday. A lawyer for a woman claiming De La Hoya raped her when 
she was 15 plans to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	The woman, now 18, claims she was raped in 1996 at a hotel in  
Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. De La Hoya, who has denied the charge, is 
accused along with his brother in a civil lawsuit seeking monetary 
damages for rape, false imprisonment, sexual battery and assault. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Reginald Dunn told lawyers to return for a status hearing  
Dec. 16 before a trial date can be set. He also ordered that the 
woman be questioned by De La Hoya's lawyers in a deposition about 
her claim of emotional distress, but ruled that no questions about 
her prior sexual activity can be asked. 
</P>
<P>
	A retired judge, Eric Younger, had instructed De La Hoya to  
reply to the questions during a deposition, and the boxer refused 
on the advice of legal counsel. 
</P>
<P>
	``The judge ruled that Mr. De La Hoya does not have to be  
deposed again, and does not have to answer further questions,'' 
said Robert Chapman, De La Hoya's lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a number of other witnesses who have knowledge about  
the case who are still to be deposed,'' the alleged victim's 
lawyer, Taras Kick, said. 
</P>
<P>
	A frend of De La Hoya, Michael Hernandez, has been dropped as a  
defendant in the case. He and Joel De La Hoya brought the girl to a 
hotel room where she was raped, lawyers for the alleged victim have 
claimed. 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya was 31-0 before losing a decision and his  
welterweight title to Felix Trinidad last month in Las Vegas, a 
bout in which De La Hoya's share of receipts was at least $15 
million.

<HEADLINE> Internet Revenues Near $500 Billion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Revenues for Internet-related businesses are  
projected to rise more than 67 percent this year to $507 billion, 
according to a study financed by one of the industry's giants. 
</P>
<P>
	With the increase over $301 billion in revenues in 1998, those  
businesses now account for 2.3 million jobs, according to the study 
by the Center for Research on Electronic Commerce at the University 
of Texas in Austin. 
</P>
<P>
	The study, funded by Cisco Systems Inc., the $12.1 billion  
computer networking company, included both those running the 
Internet -- such as computer hardware and software companies -- as 
well as those selling products over the network. Cisco provided the 
study to news organizations for publication Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	If the nation's Internet economy were to grow at even half its  
current rate the next three years, it would generate $1.2 trillion 
in revenues in 2002, the study said. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues among U.S. companies selling products over the Internet  
have more than doubled to an estimated $170 billion since last 
year, the study said. Those companies also have created 394,000 
Internet-related jobs in the past year, employing a total of nearly 
901,000 workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Remaining revenues and jobs came from companies that create  
hardware or software, support the Internet's infrastructure or act 
as intermediaries for digital transactions, such as online travel 
agents or brokerages. 
</P>
<P>
	The total Internet-related revenue of $507 billion is about 6  
percent of the nation's gross domestic product -- the broadest 
measure of economic health. 
</P>
<P>
	The study said the bulk of the economic and job growth is being  
driven by small businesses, with the largest 10 companies 
accounting for only 27 percent of all Internet revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	The university said it compiled the study's results by looking  
at 3,400 U.S. companies, with a total of 305,000 employees, that 
generate all or part of their revenues from Internet products or 
services. Some of the information was amassed using reports from 
research companies, financial reports and the Web sites for 300 of 
the largest companies.

<HEADLINE> Suit Could Have Broad Implications </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- A high school senior's request for a court  
order to extend his athletics eligibility on the ground he has a 
learning disability and needs sports as part of his education could 
encourage similar requests, lawyers said in the case said. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge heard a second day of testimony Tuesday on  
whether to continue to let Ryan Dixon, 18, play sports at Hamilton 
High School. It was not clear when U.S. District Judge Sandra 
Beckwith will rule. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge on Oct. 14 temporarily ordered Hamilton High not to  
enforce the Ohio High School Athletic Association's eight-semester 
limit on Dixon, who is in his ninth semester because he repeated 
ninth grade. 
</P>
<P>
	She told the school to follow Dixon's individualized education  
plan, which recognizes interscholastic sports as essential to his 
academic success. That plan was drafted in accordance with a 
federal law that requires schools to provide a free and appropriate 
education for handicapped students. 
</P>
<P>
	Steven Craig, the OHSAA lawyer defending the eight-semester rule  
against the Dixon lawsuit, said Tuesday the organization has not 
encountered another challenge like it. 
</P>
<P>
	The athletic association is concerned that high school athletes  
wanting to play additional years might use Dixon's lawsuit as a 
model to obtain federal court approval to get around the 
eight-semester limit, Craig said. The desire of coaches to win and 
athletes to play could increase that temptation, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'd like to think it wouldn't come to that, but we're not  
naive enough to think it won't,'' Craig said. ``As school people, 
we need to know what to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Court rulings have established that participation in school  
athletics is a privilege, not a right, Craig said. Including sports 
in a handicapped student's mandated education plan could make 
athletic participation a right and might force coaches to accept 
such players on school teams, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hamilton school district is also concerned about the effect  
that Dixon's lawsuit could have, said William Deters II, the 
district's lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge's order allowed Dixon to begin playing football last  
Friday, after sitting out most of the season. He can play in his 
school's final football game this Friday, and may play basketball 
and track later if permitted. 
</P>
<P>
	Dixon hopes to attend college and play sports, Bradley Kirlin, a  
Hamilton High special education teacher who works with the teen, 
testified Tuesday. Dixon has benefited from playing sports, but 
would receive support services for his disability even without 
athletics, Kirlin said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Ryan could graduate without athletics,'' Kirlin said  
in replying to a question by Deters. 
</P>
<P>
	State officials estimate 300,000 Ohio high school students  
participate in athletics. About 230,000 disabled students have 
individualized education plans. OHSAA officials did not know how 
many of those are athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	OHSAA, an organization of Ohio schools, is funded by state  
tournament proceeds and registration fees for game officials. It 
does not receive tax dollars. Schools must be OHSAA members to 
participate in state scholastic tournaments.

<HEADLINE> New Air Bags Reduce Deaths </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Most new vehicles on the road have much less  
powerful air bags than new cars did a few years ago and that is 
resulting in fewer deaths and serious injuries from the devices, 
safety regulators say. 
</P>
<P>
	The report Tuesday by the National Highway Traffic Safety  
Administration is the first to detail how the design of air bags 
has changed during the 1990s among eight top automakers 
representing more than 90 percent of vehicles sold in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	The report says the redesigned air bags, which were tested by  
the agency, pose less risk of death or serious injury to 
passengers. And the agency said real-world crash data also confirm 
the design changes are leading to fewer deaths from the safety 
devices, particularly among adults. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is clear that air bags in recent model year 1998 and 1999  
vehicles are less aggressive than the pre-model year 1998 air 
bags,'' the agency concludes. 
</P>
<P>
	Starting with the 1998 model year, many automakers said they  
were installing car air bags with at least 20 percent less force. 
</P>
<P>
	The change was in response to a public outcry over deaths in  
low-speed crashes blamed on air bags. 
</P>
<P>
	The safety agency found that about half of vehicles from model  
years 1998 and 1999 have driver and passenger air bags with a lower 
inflation force. The speed of inflation decreased about 22 percent 
on average for driver air bags and 14 percent for passenger air 
bags for the 1998 and 1999 models, the report says. 
</P>
<P>
	There also have been other design changes. For instance, nearly  
half of the newer vehicles have driver air bags that are more 
recessed into the steering wheel so that they inflate farther away 
from the driver. 
</P>
<P>
	The manufacturers reviewed were General Motors, Ford,  
DaimlerChrysler, Honda, Toyota, Nissan, Volkswagen and Volvo. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency did not single out manufacturers by name, claiming  
much of the data submitted were confidential and proprietary. Some 
safety groups objected to that. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted the information by make and model so the public  
could use the information for their own protection and safety,'' 
said Joan Claybrook, president of Public Citizen. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1990, air bags have been blamed for 146 deaths, mostly  
among unrestrained or improperly restrained children and shorter 
women, according to agency data. 
</P>
<P>
	But there have been few air bag deaths in vehicles from the 1998  
and 1999 model years, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	There was little change in the driver air bag fatality rate  
between model years 1992 and 1997. But officials have yet to 
attribute a single driver death to air bags in model 1999 vehicles 
and there was a significant reduction in the driver fatality rate 
in 1998 vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been two deaths that could be tied to passenger-side  
air bags in 1999 vehicles, the agency said, but that is a steep 
drop from the 1994 to 1997 model years that have totals of between 
16 and 50 deaths. 
</P>
<P>
	Automakers said the agency's report confirmed their own  
observations. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is showing depowered air bags have a positive effect on  
safety for occupants who are small or frail or older, and that we 
need to maintain depowered air bags,'' said Gloria Bergquist of the 
Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, an association representing 
11 automakers.

<HEADLINE> Brewers Release Pitcher Hideo Nomo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Hideo Nomo, the Japanese right-hander who  
rejuvenated his career with the Milwaukee Brewers, has been 
released by the club after failing to reach agreement on a new 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
	The small-market Brewers were interested in re-signing Nomo, but  
new general manager Dean Taylor and Nomo's agent, Don Nomura, were 
far apart on the 31-year-old's value. 
</P>
<P>
	``We made an aggressive offer that we thought was appropriate in  
terms of what his market value is now,'' Taylor told the Milwaukee 
Journal Sentinel at the World Series in New York on Tuesday. ``We 
wanted to keep him and we tried to be as aggressive and fair as 
possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor offered Nomo a two-year contract for a guaranteed $8.5  
million. With incentives and a third-year option, the deal could 
have been worth $14.5 million over three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Nomura is seeking a deal worth much more, as high as $27 million  
over three years. Taylor said the club was working against a 
self-imposed deadline of 2 p.m. Tuesday, and when an agreement 
couldn't be reached, Nomo was waived. 
</P>
<P>
	When Nomo signed with the Brewers five months ago, he was  
getting one of his last chances. The Mets cut him in spring 
training, and he made three minor league starts for the Chicago 
Cubs in which he had a 1-1 record and a 3.71 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago made him a $1 million contract offer, but wanted him to  
spend more time in the minors. The 1995 NL Rookie of the Year 
declined, and was released. 
</P>
<P>
	Nomo didn't look sharp in subsequent tryouts with Milwaukee and  
Cleveland, but the pitching-poor Brewers signed him anyway. In the 
words of since-fired manager Phil Garner, ``he was a pitcher who 
had been good once, and he was in our price range.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At $250,000, Nomo proved to be one of the majors' biggest  
bargains this season. He gave the Brewers pitching staff a welcome 
shot in the arm, winning six of his first seven decisions and nine 
of his first 11. He finished 12-8 with a 4.54 ERA in 28 starts. 
</P>
<P>
	Nomo is nearing the downside of his career after years of high  
pitch counts during five pro seasons in Japan and with the Dodgers. 
His tired arm can no longer throw the 95-mph fastballs that made 
him a hero on both sides of the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
	But his success in Milwaukee largely was the result of adjusting  
to his arm's limited capacities. He now pitches with a serviceable 
fastball, a slick curve and a good forkball. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year, I ruined many games,'' Nomo said earlier this  
month. ``This year, I did it much less often.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the season ended, both Nomo and the Brewers expressed hope  
that a deal could be reached, but in reality, neither side thought 
much of the possibility. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are very good surroundings. I am very comfortable  
here,'' Nomo said after his final start. ``I don't have much more 
than that to say about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His career record in the major leagues is 61-49.

<HEADLINE> Gray Apologizes for Rose Interview </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- NBC reporter Jim Gray apologized to baseball  
fans Tuesday night for his contentious interview with Pete Rose 
before Game 2 of the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC was deluged by complaints from fans Sunday night after  
Gray's interview with Rose at Turner Field in Atlanta. It centered 
on Rose's lifetime ban from the sport for gambling, and came 
minutes after he returned to a major league field for the first 
time in 10 years as a member of baseball's All-Century team. 
</P>
<P>
	During NBC's pregame show Tuesday night at Yankee Stadium, Gray  
spoke of the incident. 
</P>
<P>
	``After viewing the videotape, I can understand the reaction of  
many baseball fans,'' Gray said. ``I thought that it was important 
to ask Pete Rose if this was the right moment for him to make an 
apology. 
</P>
<P>
	``If in doing so, the interview went on too long and took out  
some of the joy of the occasion, then I want to say to baseball 
fans everywhere that I'm very sorry about this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fans seem willing to forgive Rose, speaking out in polls in  
favor of his reinstatement to baseball. He received the longest 
ovation of any baseball hero introduced Sunday at Atlanta's Turner 
Field. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose told Gray he was ``surprised you're bombarding me like this  
on such a festive occasion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview Monday, Gray said his questions shouldn't have  
surprised Rose since other reporters asked the same things at a 
news conference shortly before. 
</P>
<P>
	Dick Ebersol, chairman of NBC Sports, backed Gray by calling him  
``the best TV sports reporter of his generation.'' However, Ebersol 
said he thought the interview ``probably went too long.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Switchboards at NBC affiliates across the country were bombarded  
by phone calls from people angry at Gray -- two hours nonstop at 
WLWT in Cincinnati, where Rose collected most of his record 4,256 
hits for the hometown Reds. 
</P>
<P>
	Yankees manager Joe Torre said the interview was uncalled-for.  
``For some reason, we've lost sight of the word `respect.' We deal 
too much in shock value.''

<HEADLINE> FIFA Panel Impressed by England Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- A FIFA inspection panel left London Tuesday  
impressed by England's bid to stage the 2006 World Cup, but didn't 
give any hints about where it stood in relation to its rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	England is competing with Germany, South Africa, Brazil and  
Morocco to stage soccer's biggest competition. 
</P>
<P>
	The six-member FIFA delegation was flown around England by  
helicopter to sites in Birmingham, Derby, Sunderland, Liverpool and 
Manchester to examine the facilities already in place as well as 
those proposed, including a new Wembley stadium which will open in 
2003. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel, which visited Germany last week, will examine the  
three other bids before reporting back to FIFA's 24-member 
executive committee, which will make a decision in July. 
</P>
<P>
	Led by former United States Soccer Federation president Alan  
Rothenberg, the committee held a news conference at the end of its 
six-day visit. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to look behind the bid and see if it's more than just  
a handful of people who really care about this,'' Rothenberg said. 
``The commitment and passion at all levels for the sport and for 
hosting the World Cup is very impressive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The committee also met Prime Minister Tony Blair and movie star  
Hugh Grant, both soccer fans. 
</P>
<P>
	Rothenberg said one of the advantages in choosing England is its  
sophisticated security system. 
</P>
<P>
	``The stadiums were outstanding and the new Wembley will be a  
magnificent facility,'' Rothenberg said. ``We were as much 
impressed with the older stadiums that had been renovated without 
destroying their great traditions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not decision makers but I can assume we have some  
influence. England has all the elements of a successful bid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although the committee was invited to two gala banquets and were  
flown around by helicopter, Rothenberg said he didn't think the 
hospitality was excessive. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think the entertainment was lavish,'' he said. ``We  
had to fit a lot of engagements into a small space of time and 
helicopters and planes were the best way to do this. We stayed in 
some nice hotels but a bed is a bed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alec McGivan, the England 2006 bid director, who has been joined  
by former star players Bobby Charlton and Geoff Hurst on the 
campaign trail, said he felt confident the FIFA delegation had been 
impressed. 
</P>
<P>
	``The case for England gets stronger week by week,'' he said.  
``I think there's a growing recognition that this country offers 
the best and first class venue for the World Cup.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Signs Nationwide 911 Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton signed legislation Tuesday  
making 911 the official emergency number nationwide -- for both 
regular and cellular phones. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure also calls for development of technology that can  
track mobile callers. 
</P>
<P>
	People with wireless phones now will be able to speed responses  
to highway accidents, crimes and natural disasters,'' Clinton said. 
``Getting rapid care to someone who is suffering from a heart 
attack or is involved in a car crash can mean the difference 
between life and death.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While 911 is widely used as the emergency number for traditional  
phones, there are 20 different codes for wireless callers across 
the country. The changes are aimed at cutting response times for 
the crews who answer 98,000 emergency calls daily from cellular 
phone callers. 
</P>
<P>
	``In my home state,'' said Sen. Conrad Burns, R-Mont., ``three  
quarters of the deaths in rural areas are because the first 
responders couldn't get there in time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Health care professionals joined Burns at a Capitol Hill news  
conference to applaud the new law. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have great emergency room personnel. We can do a lot for  
accident victims if we can find them and get them there,'' said 
Barbara Foley of the Emergency Nurses Association. ``That's what 
this legislation helps us do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another provision of the act directed the Federal Communications  
Commission to help states develop emergency systems, including 
technology that can automatically locate cellular callers who have 
dialed 911 or been involved in an accident. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC in September moved forward with plans to require that  
cellular 911 calls automatically provide a caller's location. 
Regulators want manufacturers to begin providing locator technology 
within two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Privacy advocates have raised concerns about potential abuse of  
the technology, which would take advantage of the Global 
Positioning System developed by the military. 
</P>
<P>
	The law signed Tuesday called on regulators to establish  
``appropriate privacy protection for call location information,'' 
including systems that provide automatic notification when a 
vehicle is involved in an accident. 
</P>
<P>
	It said that calls could only be tracked in nonemergency  
situations if the subscriber had provided written approval. ``The 
customer must grant such authority expressly in advance of such 
use, disclosure or access,'' according to Senate documents 
detailing provisions of the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 700 small and rural counties have no coordinated  
emergency service to call -- even with traditional phones. The bill 
would encourage private 911 providers to move into those areas by 
granting the same liability protections to wireless operations that 
now are offered to wireline emergency service systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, the FCC took action earlier this year to increase  
the number of cellular calls to 911 that are successfully 
completed. The commission required that new analog cellular phones 
-- not existing phones -- be made with software that routes 911 calls 
to another carrier when a customer's own service cannot complete 
the call. 
</P>
<P>
	Calls sometimes aren't completed because a caller is in an area  
where his or her carrier does not have an antenna, because networks 
are overloaded or because buildings or geography block signals.

<HEADLINE> GTE Files AT&AMP;T Antitrust Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- AT&AMP;T Corp., already wrangling with local  
governments for control over who can sell Internet service on its 
cable systems, is being challenged on another front with a federal 
antitrust suit. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit filed Monday by telephone rival GTE Corp. could force a  
firmer stance by federal officials, who've largely shied away from 
the issue except to oppose local laws regulating cable-Internet 
access. 
</P>
<P>
	GTE Corp. is charging monopolistic practices by both AT&AMP;T and  
Comcast, another cable company that owns an interest in 
ExciteAtHome, a cable Internet service that is controlled by AT&AMP;T. 
</P>
<P>
	ExciteAtHome holds exclusive rights to provide Internet access  
on AT&AMP;T's and Comcast's cable systems, and customers wishing to use 
another Internet service such as America Online need to pay two 
monthly fees. 
</P>
<P>
	``The defendants are illegally exploiting their economic power  
over high-speed Internet access to deprive Americans of their right 
to choose their ISP,'' GTE said in a statement announcing the suit. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today, Americans can choose among thousands of ISPs when they  
sign up for Internet access with the telephone companies,'' said 
William P. Barr, executive vice president and general counsel of 
GTE, which has only about half a million subscribers to its 
Internet service. ``But in the high-speed Internet access world of 
(AT&AMP;T) and Comcast, consumers don't have a choice. They are forced 
to accept AtHome as their only on-ramp to the Internet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T, Comcast and ExciteAtHome all issued brief statements  
attacking the suit as hypocritical, calling GTE a monopoly in the 
markets where it provides local phone service. 
</P>
<P>
	They also reiterated arguments that cable lines are just a new  
form of competition for telephone companies whose copper lines are 
the primary means by which people access the World Wide Web. 
</P>
<P>
	``The overwhelming majority of customers must access the  
Internet over dial-up facilities from GTE and the other local 
telephone monopolies,'' said Jim Cicconi, AT&AMP;T general counsel, in 
a statement. ``Now that AT&AMP;T is trying to use cable facilities to 
bring choice to the monopolies' customers, GTE is using every trick 
in the book to delay that competition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T has been fighting similar battles on numerous fronts almost  
since the very start of its foray into cable earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoping to bypass the Baby Bell system for providing telephone  
and Internet service, AT&AMP;T is spending more than $100 billion to 
buy and upgrade a broad swath of the nation's cable systems. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of its purchase of Tele-Communications Inc., one of the  
nation's two biggest cable companies, AT&AMP;T gained control of 
ExciteAtHome, which it placed at the focal point of the new cable 
Internet initiative. 
</P>
<P>
	Many local governments have bristled, however, at the notion of  
allowing AT&AMP;T to completely dominate what some see as the most 
promising way -- at least in the near term -- to provide a more 
robust Internet service than is possible over regular copper phone 
lines. 
</P>
<P>
	Several of the governments have moved to pass laws requiring  
AT&AMP;T and other cable companies to share their lines with rivals for 
a fee in the same way that long-distance calling companies pay the 
Baby Bells to complete their calls over their local phone networks. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T and other cable operators argue that they are spending  
billions of dollars to upgrade their cable systems for Internet and 
telephone service and should be allowed to recoup their 
investments. They also argue that DSL, the high-speed Internet 
connection that uses a regular phone line, is a very viable 
alternative for rival providers of Internet access. 
</P>
<P>
	The standoff initially looked grim for AT&AMP;T, which has been  
trying to ease a highly public spat with AOL and overturn laws 
passed in Portland, Ore., and Broward County, Fla., that require 
open access to the local cable system. 
</P>
<P>
	But AT&AMP;T won a small victory last week when county commissioners  
for Miami-Dade County in Florida voted against passing similar 
regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Federal Communications Commission says it holds the  
ultimate authority to regulate Internet access, the agency has 
clung to the sidelines, fearful that government meddling will 
discourage companies like AT&AMP;T from upgrading the nation's cable 
systems.

<HEADLINE> Yanks, Braves Hope History Repeats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- If ever a team looked like it had no chance in  
the World Series, it was the New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	Three years ago, that is.  
</P>
<P>
	``When we won the first two games here in 1996, no one gave them  
a chance, either,'' Atlanta third baseman Chipper Jones said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``And they came back against our staff when they were in their  
prime. It's definitely a steep hill to climb, but it's possible,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Down 0-2 after a bumbling effort in a 7-2 loss, the Braves  
brushed up on their batting and history during an off-day workout 
at Yankee Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta is hoping to repeat the Yankees' performance of October  
1996, when New York overcame its shaky start to win four straight. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any team that has good pitching like we have, we can always  
reel off three in a row,'' Braves manager Bobby Cox said. ``We've 
always been able to do something like that. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's no different now,'' he said. ``But we've got to be  
hitting the ball a little better, too. They have great pitching.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Andy Pettitte will start for the Yankees in Game 3 tonight. As  
it stands, Tom Glavine is scheduled to pitch for the Braves. 
</P>
<P>
	Scratched from starting the opener because of the flu, Glavine  
has lost 5-to-7 pounds since then and looked pale Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know how much weight you can gain back eating soup and  
eating crackers. But I feel OK,'' Glavine said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know how my stamina's going to be, to be honest with  
you. I think if it was a summertime game and it was going to be 100 
degrees, I'd be a whole lot more concerned about it than I would be 
tomorrow, where it's going to be cool,'' he said. ``That obviously 
will help a whole lot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Glavine cannot pitch, John Smoltz will take his place.  
</P>
<P>
	Halfway to their second consecutive title and 25th overall, the  
Yankees have outpitched the club with the most vaunted rotation in 
the majors. Orlando ``El Duque'' Hernandez held the Braves to one 
hit for seven innings in the opener, then David Cone did the exact 
same thing in Game 2 Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Pettitte pitched the game of his life against Atlanta three  
years ago, outdueling Smoltz 1-0 at Atlanta to give the Yankees a 
3-2 edge in the Series. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was '96. The past doesn't mean much around here now,''  
Pettitte said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves won two of three at Yankee Stadium in July during  
interleague play. Of course, based on what everyone saw at Turner 
Field this weekend, it's hard to imagine Atlanta will last long 
unless it gets a lot better, a lot sooner in all areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Here's another tidbit: Never in their postseason history have  
the Braves been eliminated in a best-of-7 series in under six 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	As if it did not have enough things already in its favor, New  
York also gets to use the designated hitter for the games at Yankee 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	That means either Darryl Strawberry or Chili Davis will be in  
the lineup Tuesday night, both swinging potent bats. The Braves 
plan on using Jose Hernandez as their DH and, with Pettitte 
pitching, probably will have Eddie Perez, Bret Boone and Walt Weiss 
back in the lineup after a one-game benching. 
</P>
<P>
	``The demeanor is still the same, the mindset is still the  
same,'' Jones said. ``We've played well here in the past. 
Hopefully, we can draw on that and use it to our advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be tough. But we've still got life. We've still  
got some fight in us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees are aware of that. And of history, too.  
</P>
<P>
	``It'll benefit us,'' first baseman Tino Martinez said. ``We'll  
be focused and guard against being complacent.''

<HEADLINE> 'Canes: New Home Is Like Christmas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- You'll have to forgive some of the Carolina  
Hurricanes for going through the motions during the team's first 
practice at the Raleigh Entertainment and Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't see more than two or three minutes of practice when I  
was out there,'' an excited coach Paul Maurice said about 
Carolina's first workout at its new $158 million home. ``It's so 
hard to explain. In a lot of ways we feel like we're back in the 
NHL. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's not a knock against Greensboro, but we've traveled so  
much and spent a long time without the feeling that we really had a 
home. There is an excitement from everybody. This is just great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The defending Southeast Division champions practiced Monday for  
the first time in the 18,700-seat arena that will be the team's 
permanent home. Workers were putting the finishing touches on the 
building. 
</P>
<P>
	Carolina played in the Greensboro Coliseum for two years while  
the new building was being built. 
</P>
<P>
	Workers wiped down seats and placed floor tiles near the  
Carolina locker room, which wasn't completed yet. The team dressed 
in the visitor's locker room for Monday's practice, but nobody 
seemed to mind. 
</P>
<P>
	``The building is state-of-the-art,'' team captain Ron Francis  
said. ``I like the way it's structured, with the majority of 
seating being in the lower bowl. That's a neat way to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ice surface, a major concern in other arenas across the NHL  
-- especially in the South -- got mixed reviews. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't push it too hard,'' Maurice said. ``We felt if we  
could get 30 minutes out of it without having a flood we would be 
in good shape, and it held up well. We'll try (today) maybe a 
little harder, but there were very few ruts in it. I was very 
encouraged. The ice is not very far off at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Goaltender Arturs Irbe had a different perspective.  
</P>
<P>
	``Once it got skated on for awhile and we created some snow on  
the top, it crystallized and kind of got a little bit wet and froze 
on the top,'' Irbe said. ``That's what we are dealing with in every 
single arena down South. It wasn't worse than other arenas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Once the building is closed down for several days, the ice  
should get harder and firmer, Maurice said. However, it's unclear 
how a sellout crowd like the one for Friday's home opener against 
New Jersey will affect the ice. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it becomes better, it's just a bonus,'' Irbe said.  
</P>
<P>
	Center Jeff O'Neill, the first Carolina player to skate on the  
ice, said it felt like Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ice in the South, you wonder about it sometimes,'' O'Neill  
said. ``It seemed really good out there. Everybody was anxious this 
morning, and I wanted to get out there and shoot some pucks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Irbe got lost taking a shortcut to the new building, but said it  
was better than having to make the 160-mile roundtrip drive to 
Greensboro. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to take a little while for it to sink in,'' general  
manager Jim Rutherford said. ``I hope our team can adjust to the 
building very quickly and know that they're home.''

<HEADLINE> Jordan Sues Over Use of His Name </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Michael Jordan asked a federal court Tuesday to  
end an agreement under which he sold two restaurateurs the use of 
his name for eateries in Chicago and surrounding counties. 
</P>
<P>
	In a federal court battle that has been waged for almost two  
years, attorneys for the former basketball star charged that 
companies run by Chicago businessmen Gene and Joe Silverberg ``have 
breached their promise to protect Mr. Jordan's name and the good 
will associated with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They have orchestrated a campaign to diminish the value of Mr.  
Jordan's name and its good will,'' they said in court papers. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan signed an agreement with the Silverbergs in September  
1990 allowing the use of his name for restaurants in the six-county 
area surrounding Chicago. They opened Michael Jordan's restaurant 
just north of downtown, and it became an instant magnet for 
tourists. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result of the legal battle, however, the Silverbergs  
recently dropped the use of Jordan's name and renamed the 
restaurant for Chicago Cubs slugger Sammy Sosa. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit was filed initially by the Silverbergs in November  
1997, seeking to block Jordan from developing a new restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
	The new restaurant, One Sixtyblue, is located west of downtown  
Chicago. It doesn't use Jordan's name, but he has ownership 
interest in it.

<HEADLINE> Fiber May Help Prevent Obesity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A high-fiber diet, already linked to  
preventing heart disease and cancer, may also fight obesity, 
according to a new 10-year study released Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The study found that young adults who ate at least 21 grams of  
fiber per day gained, on average, eight pounds less over the 
10-year period than those who ate the least amount of fiber. 
</P>
<P>
	``At all levels of fat intake, individuals eating the most fiber  
gained less weight than those eating the least fiber,'' according 
to the study presented at an American Medical Association 
conference for science reporters. It appears in Wednesday's Journal 
of the American Medical Association. 
</P>
<P>
	The new study involved more than 2,900 adults who consumed 15  
grams to 25 grams of fiber daily (a bowl of high-fiber cereal can 
contain 25 grams). 
</P>
<P>
	In the study, fiber consumption also seemed to provide a more  
accurate gauge than fat consumption when predicting weight gain, 
blood cholesterol levels and other risks for cardiovascular 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not recommending that we go out and put Metamucil on our  
Haagen-Dazs,'' said study author Dr. David S. Ludwig of Children's 
Hospital in Boston. But ``you certainly do better by eating 
unprocessed foods -- the way grandma told us to eat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Federal guidelines recommended 20 to 25 grams of fiber per day.  
The study made no recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
	Fiber slows the rate of nutrient absorption following a meal,  
reducing the rise of blood sugar levels and secretion of insulin. A 
high blood insulin level has been associated as a risk factor for 
cardiovascular disease.

<HEADLINE> Sanders Put Himself Back in Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IRVING, Texas (AP) -- With Steve Young, it's his head. With  
Michael Irvin, it's his neck. 
</P>
<P>
	With Deion Sanders, it could've been either. Or both.  
</P>
<P>
	Sanders was fortunate to avoid the serious injuries of his  
current and former teammates when he put himself back into Sunday's 
game about an hour after suffering a concussion. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders supported his self-diagnosis by returning a punt 70  
yards for a touchdown, sealing Dallas' 38-20 victory over 
Washington and adding another memorable moment to a career filled 
with them. 
</P>
<P>
	All the applause for his courageous performance has obscured the  
danger -- and logic -- of allowing a player who has taken a blow to 
the head to overrule doctors and return to a game quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said Tuesday he didn't question  
Sanders' decision because he believes the former two-sport star 
knows his body better than anyone. He noted that an MRI Sanders 
took Monday showed no damage, which indicates the injury probably 
wasn't too severe. 
</P>
<P>
	``An athlete of his stature and experience, someone of his  
instincts about his physical condition, probably knows better how 
far to extend himself than the average football player,'' Jones 
said. ``That probably, subconsciously, was on everybody's mind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders was injured on a first-quarter punt return when he  
locked helmets and shoulder pads with Washington deep snapper Dan 
Turk, who outweighs the cornerback by nearly 100 pounds. The 
collision sent Sanders backwards into another big guy, fullback 
Mike Sellers, who sent Sanders to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders was sent to the locker room and wasn't expected to  
return. Then, as Washington finished its fourth play of the third 
quarter, Sanders jogged out the tunnel and straight to his right 
cornerback spot without breaking stride. 
</P>
<P>
	He played six snaps, then went to the sidelines. Jones said no  
doctors or trainers re-evaluated Sanders after he returned. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once he was out there and playing that was it,'' Jones said.  
``Everybody else was paying more attention to what was going on in 
the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to talk about how we handle injuries on any type  
of policy basis because we don't have one. They're addressed to the 
situation, injury by injury and circumstance by circumstance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders made only one tackle after returning. It wasn't until  
resuming punt return duties that he put himself in a compromising 
position. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders protected himself the best way possible -- not getting  
hit. The Redskins didn't lay a finger on him as he raced to the end 
zone. 
</P>
<P>
	Cowboys coach Chan Gailey had assumed that doctors had cleared  
Sanders to return. It wasn't until the celebration of the touchdown 
that he learned the truth. 
</P>
<P>
	Gailey pulled Sanders soon after because Dallas had a big lead  
and Washington had little time to recover. 
</P>
<P>
	The coach said what Sanders did was fine by him, noting that  
players ``take that risk every time they take the field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to always be cautious, but at the same time I'm  
going to allow guys to play if they feel well enough to play,'' 
Gailey said. ``People are the best judge of their own bodies and 
know how to handle things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders' primary incentive to return was to continue his battle  
with Redskins receivers Albert Connell and Michael Westbrook, both 
of whom had taunted him in the days leading up to the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders also had a financial incentive to return. He'll get a  
$1.5 million bonus if he plays 70 percent of Dallas' defensive 
snaps and makes the Pro Bowl. Missing the first two games with a 
toe injury has left him playing catchup in both areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones noted that Sanders decided when to return from his toe  
injury, so he deserved the benefit of the doubt this time, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know we've let him be the judge when he was ready to go  
regarding other injuries he's had,'' Jones said. ``He is a real 
stickler for his health. So he does know how to watch it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As Sanders left the stadium, he encountered his toughest critic  
in the parking lot: his mother, Connie Knight, who wanted to know 
why he returned. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ma, I'm all right,'' Sanders said. ``I'm all right.''

<HEADLINE> UN Spokesman Fires Back at Buchanan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Pat Buchanan opened his campaign for the  
Reform Party presidential nomination this week with an attack on 
one of his favorite targets, the United Nations. But a U.N. 
spokesman said Tuesday that Buchanan got some of his facts wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	Announcing his switch from the Republican Party to the Reform  
Party on Monday, Buchanan claimed U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan 
had threatened the United States with losing its vote in the United 
Nations if it doesn't pay $1 billion in arrears. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would give Mr. Kofi this word of advice: Sir, don't go  
there. Because if our vote in the U.N. is in jeopardy, your lease 
on Turtle Bay is in jeopardy,'' Buchanan said, referring to the 
prime real estate that U.N. headquarters occupies along New York 
City's East River. 
</P>
<P>
	U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard was quick to tell reporters that  
Buchanan was wrong on two counts. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the record Pat, the secretary-general has nothing to do  
with it. The U.N. Charter says in Article 13 that the loss of vote 
is automatic when a member falls behind by two years or more,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``As for the lease, there is none. We own this land, thanks to a  
gift by John D. Rockefeller, Jr., and land transfers from the City 
of New York,'' Eckhard. 
</P>
<P>
	According to official U.N. accounting, the U.S. debt to the  
world body now totals $1.8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	To keep its vote in the United Nations, Washington must pay at  
least $350 million of its debt by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan has advocated an isolationist foreign policy, calling  
for a virtual end to foreign aid.

<HEADLINE>  Poll Shows Gore Gaining Ground </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- For much of the year, polls have not been the  
bearer of good news for Al Gore. But that may be changing, less 
than a month after the vice president shook up his campaign and 
moved its headquarters from Washington to Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore widened his lead against Democratic presidential rival Bill  
Bradley and gained ground on Republican front-runner George W. Bush 
in a poll released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore has stretched his lead over Bradley, a former New Jersey  
senator, to 25 points -- 57 percent to 32 percent in the CNN/USA 
Today/Gallup poll. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley had narrowed the national margin in that same poll to 12  
points earlier this month, and has been running even with Gore in 
recent polls in the key states of Iowa, New Hampshire and New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore also closed the gap on Bush, narrowing a head-to-head  
matchup from 16 points behind the Texas governor earlier this month 
to 9 points down, 52 percent to 43 percent. Bush was 15 points 
ahead of Bradley, 54 percent to 39 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	If Pat Buchanan is included in the mix as a Reform Party  
candidate, Gore trails Bush by 6 percentage points, 48 percent to 
42 percent. Buchanan gets 5 percent in that hypothetical race. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan made his switch to the Reform Party official Monday. By  
a 3-1 margin, Republicans and those leaning Republican said 
Buchanan's Reform candidacy would hurt Republicans rather than help 
them, 37 percent to 12 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll asked whether people would prefer to see Pat Buchanan  
or businessman Donald Trump win the Reform Party nomination and, by 
a wide margin, Americans want to see Buchanan get the nod, 48 
percent to 29 percent. When the question is asked only of Reform 
Party supporters, Buchanan gets an even wider margin of support. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush had a wide lead over his Republican rivals for the  
nomination, 66 percent to 11 percent for Sen. John McCain of 
Arizona and 7 percent for businessman Steve Forbes. The other 
candidates were in the low single digits.

<HEADLINE> Magic Johnson Returns for One Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BORAS, Sweden (AP) -- Magic Johnson, getting a standing ovation  
and showing a hint of his flamboyant game, returned to competitive 
basketball Tuesday night and led the Swedish club Magic M7 to an 
easy victory. 
</P>
<P>
	The 40-year-old star -- 10 years older than any other player on  
the court -- scored 14 points in an 84-60 rout of Sallen in the 
Swedish basketball league. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first half was a little tough, but the second was  
easier,'' Johnson told the crowd of 3,319 after playing his first 
game other than an exhibition since leaving the NBA for good in 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson was cheered when he promised to play more games for  
Magic M7. M7, which missed the playoffs last season, is 7-0 this 
season. His appearance had generated great interest in basketball 
in Boras, a city of 110,000 in western Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson helped the Los Angeles Lakers win five NBA titles. He  
tested positive for the AIDS virus in 1991. He retired for the 
first time just before the start of the 1991-92 season. 
</P>
<P>
	He won a gold medal in the 1992 Olympics and made a brief  
comeback before the 1992-93 season. But he quit again after several 
players expressed concerns about playing against him. 
</P>
<P>
	In January 1996, he returned to the Lakers and played the  
remaining half of the season. He retired again after the Lakers 
were eliminated from the playoffs.

<HEADLINE> Payne Stewart Service Friday  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- A memorial service for golfer Payne Stewart  
will be held Friday at the First Baptist Church of Orlando, where 
Stewart attended services and where his children go to day school. 
</P>
<P>
	With 10,000 members, the church is the largest in Orlando and  
seats more than 5,000 people in its worship center. Stewart had 
recently donated $500,000 to the church. 
</P>
<P>
	Family members were hoping Nashville-based Christian singer  
Michael W. Smith would perform at the service, said the Rev. Steve 
Smith, one of the church's 15 pastors. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Jim Henry, the church's senior pastor, and the Rev.  
J.B. Collingsworth, who was especially close to Stewart and his 
family, were expected to deliver eulogies. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart, 42, and five others were killed Monday when the jet  
they were in nosedived into a South Dakota field after flying on 
auto pilot for 1,400 miles across the country. 
</P>
<P>
	While Stewart's family made plans for the service, friends  
continued Tuesday to pay their respects at the Stewarts' gated 
mansion in the Windermere community, about 10 miles southwest of 
Orlando. A steady stream of people came to comfort Stewart's wife, 
Tracey, and their children, 13-year-old Chelsea and 10-year-old 
Aaron. 
</P>
<P>
	Also killed were Stewart's sports agents Robert Fraley, 46, and  
Van Ardan, 45; and pilots Michael Kling, 43, and Stephanie 
Bellegarrigue, 27. Also believed to be aboard was Bruce Borland, 
40, a golf course designer. 
</P>
<P>
	Separate services for Fraley, Ardan and Borland were tentatively  
scheduled for Thursday. No arrangements had been made for Ms. 
Bellegarrigue as of Tuesday, said Helena Reidemar, a friend. 
</P>
<P>
	Plans for Kling were not immediately available.

<HEADLINE> $5M of Ecstasy Claimed at Airport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- Call it the $5 million bumping.  
</P>
<P>
	Three travelers from the Netherlands were bumped from their  
overbooked flight to Newark International Airport. But their bags 
were already aboard and landed Friday before they came in on a 
later flight. 
</P>
<P>
	As usual, Customs Agents searched the three unclaimed suitcases,  
and they discovered about 200,000 pills of the illegal drug 
ecstasy, each bearing a likeness of Buddha. 
</P>
<P>
	The pills have a street value of $5 million, making it the most  
lucrative ecstasy seizure at any U.S. port, said Thomas Manifase, 
assistant special agent in charge of the Newark customs office. 
</P>
<P>
	``These things were packed with so much ecstasy, they weren't  
counting on getting inspected,'' Manifase said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Along with a few clothes, each suitcase contained about 35  
pounds of the pills, vacuum-packed in plastic and wrapped in blue 
carbon paper in the mistaken belief that the paper deflects X-rays, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The three suspects, Dutch citizens ages 46, 51 and 54, called  
the airline from their hotel in New York City to ask for their 
suitcases. They were arrested by agents who posed as airline 
workers delivering the bags. 
</P>
<P>
	Each could face up to 20 years in prison if convicted.

<HEADLINE> Soy Products Can Tout Benefits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARLINGTON, Va. (AP) -- Doing their grocery shopping, Anne and  
Steve Browning skipped the dairy case and instead plunked five 
cartons of soymilk into their cart. ``We bought it because we kept 
hearing about how good it was for you,'' said Mrs. Browning. ``We 
don't buy milk anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the government now allowing food labels to tout soy's  
ability to lower cholesterol, a new surge of interest is expected, 
and not just in traditional such soy-based foods as tofu and 
soymilk. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers can look for soy to start showing up in everything  
from bread and cereal to soup and salad dressing, industry analysts 
say. 
</P>
<P>
	``Soy is a big food opportunity,'' said Carlos Gutierrez,  
president of the Kellogg Co. Kellogg's is acquiring the biggest 
maker of soy-based meat alternatives, Worthington Foods, and 
announced this week it is developing a soy cereal. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales of soymilk, tofu and other soy-based foods are expected to  
reach $2.14 billion this year, up from $852 million in 1992, and 
reach $2.6 billion next year, according to Soyatech Inc., which 
tracks the industry. Soymilk sales alone are growing at close to 40 
percent a year. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. production of soy additives like the flour and concentrates  
that are mixed into bread and other conventional foods is valued at 
$1.8 billion this year, triple what it was in 1992, and is expected 
to hit $3.3 billion by 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	Soy ``is going to continue to cross over into the mainstream''  
market, said Peter Golbitz, president of Soyatech. ``The historical 
growth in the industry was without a health claim. The health claim 
is icing on the cake and will push food companies to add soy 
proteins to a variety of food products.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Studies indicate that soy also may have anticancer properties  
and may fight osteoporosis as well as symptoms of menopause, but 
its ability to lower cholesterol levels is the best documented. 
</P>
<P>
	The new food labels are expected to start appearing in grocery  
stores within days. 
</P>
<P>
	In order to qualify for the label, foods must contain 6.25 grams  
of soy protein per serving, one-fourth of the 25 grams of soy 
protein daily that studies have shown is needed to show a 
significant cholesterol-lowering effect. An ounce is a little more 
than 25 grams. 
</P>
<P>
	Foods most likely to be eligible include soy beverages, tofu,  
soy-based meat alternatives and baked goods, according to the Food 
and Drug Administration. A soy burger patty has about 10 grams of 
soy protein, depending on the manufacturer, and an 8-ounce glass of 
soymilk about 6.5 grams. 
</P>
<P>
	Food makers have traditionally left the soy market to small  
entrepreneurs, but that's changing. 
</P>
<P>
	Along with Kellogg's acquistion of Worthington Foods, Dean Foods  
Co., the nation's largest milk processor, recently took a minority 
stake in Boulder, Colo.-based White Wave Inc., a vegetarian food 
company. White Wave makes Silk, one of the fastest growing brands 
of soymilk. 
</P>
<P>
	Silk, sold in traditional milk cartons and requiring  
refrigeration, unlike most soymilk, is now in 8,000 conventional 
supermarkets, compared with 100 a year ago. White Wave officials 
say they hope to be in 10,000 by New Year's. 
</P>
<P>
	To gain broad acceptance, however, soy drinks and foods such as  
tofu will have to overcome a reputation as relatively tasteless. 
</P>
<P>
	``You definitely have to do something to them. It's not  
something you take out for a snack,'' said Jane Overslaugh, who was 
buying soymilk in a Fresh Fields natural-foods supermarket in 
Arlington. She cooks with tofu and mixes soymilk in smoothies.

<HEADLINE> Poverty Politics a Campaign Staple </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The politics of poverty are back in style,  
with the leading presidential candidates staking out territory on 
one of the nation's most persistent problems. 
</P>
<P>
	But the debate has changed, with welfare reform making it safe  
for candidates to talk about the poor without having to rail 
against or defend a broken system. Now, even the most liberal of 
the pack is talking about programs that revolve around working, 
albeit poor, families. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Democrats Bill Bradley and Vice President Al Gore  
offered plans, and GOP front-runner Gov. George W. Bush made 
headlines by chastising congressional Republicans for trying to 
``balance their budget on the backs of the poor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's clear that poverty is in,'' said Douglas Besharov, who  
studies welfare policy at the conservative American Enterprise 
Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of it is simple politics. Bradley and Gore are locked in a  
Democratic primary, where liberals hold significant sway. Fighting 
poverty is certainly popular with liberals. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, the Texas governor, is campaigning as a ``compassionate  
conservative'' trying to break from the harsh reputation that 
bedevils fellow Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	But analysts suspect something deeper is afoot.  
</P>
<P>
	``I ask myself the question, is this purely political  
positioning?'' said Robert Greenstein, director of the liberal 
Center for Budget and Policy Priorities. ``I think there's 
something more fundamental going on. There seems to be a change in 
the public mood.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Much of it can be traced to the 1996 welfare overhaul, which  
allowed states to design their own programs, required recipients to 
work and limited cash assistance to five years. 
</P>
<P>
	The strict rules, combined with a thriving economy, have helped  
drive welfare rolls to a 30-year low. At the same time, there are 
new perceptions of welfare recipients as people struggling to make 
it, rather than as lazy loafers milking the system. 
</P>
<P>
	Each of Bradley's major proposals -- increasing the minimum wage,  
putting more money into child care and boosting the earned income 
tax credit -- are aimed at the working poor. 
</P>
<P>
	He does not urge rolling back welfare reform. He doesn't  
advocate more training for recipients or allowing more people into 
education programs. And while he voted against the welfare bill 
when he was in the Senate, the plan he introduced last week would 
build on it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm trying to make the best of where we are today,'' Bradley  
said Tuesday on NBC's ``Today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to monitor it very carefully,'' he added. ``But if  
the governors take care of it, fine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Gore is taking another post-welfare reform angle,  
focusing on the role of fathers now that the new system forces most 
mothers into the labor force. 
</P>
<P>
	``Poverty in the United States is now driven in significant  
measure by the breakup of families,'' Gore told The Associated 
Press in interview last week, echoing a common refrain of 
conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, meanwhile, has proposed tax incentives to encourage  
Americans to contribute money to groups that fight poverty. And he 
wants religious organizations to qualify for more government 
contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	Additional proposals are to come, said Stephen Goldsmith, the  
Indianapolis mayor and a Bush campaign adviser. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it (the issue) will get lost,'' he said, calling  
a Republican commitment to fighting poverty ``an extraordinary new 
dynamic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The strong economy also plays a role.  
</P>
<P>
	With most voters' personal finances in decent shape, they are  
interested in helping those less fortunate, said Andrew Kohut, 
director of the Pew Center for People and the Press. His polling 
finds that a significant share of people -- 41 percent -- think it 
very important for candidates to talk about the gap between the 
rich and the poor. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawrence Aber, director of the National Center for Children in  
Poverty at Columbia University, suggests this may be the beginning 
of a new national debate about poverty. 
</P>
<P>
	Some hope he's right.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm watching for the first time in years presidential  
candidates compete as to who can produce more to reduce child 
poverty,'' Greenstein said. ``I'm definitely feeling encouraged by 
the direction the debate is going.''

<HEADLINE> DaimlerChrysler Earns $1.6 Billion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- DaimlerChrysler AG surprised Wall Street analysts  
Tuesday with third-quarter earnings well above expectations, thanks 
to vigorous sales of Chrysler trucks and Mercedes-Benz luxury cars. 
</P>
<P>
	The German-American company said its earnings were up 14 percent  
in the third quarter to $1.6 billion, or $1.65 a share, after 
adjustments for one-time charges and gains. That compares to $1.41 
billion, or $1.45 a share, in the same period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The results beat Wall Street estimates of $1.39 a share, and  
followed robust profits from Ford Motor Co. and General Motors 
Corp. DaimlerChrysler also said it expects strong growth in profits 
and revenue for the full year as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly all of our businesses are doing well,''  
DaimlerChrysler co-chairman Robert J. Eaton said. ``It was a very 
good quarter. Markets continue to be strong in the U.S. as well as 
Europe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues rose 15 percent, from $33.4 billion to $38.6 billion,  
due to growth in most of DaimlerChrysler's automotive, services and 
aerospace business units, the company said. The figures are based 
on the exchange rate for the euro in effect on Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
	The figures are based on the exchange rate of $1.0643 per euro  
in effect on Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said its Chrysler car division had record revenues  
of $16.1 billion for the three months ending in September, an 
increase of 19 percent over last year. Its operating profit was up 
26 percent, from $984 million to $1.2 billion, before a $149 
million charge for lump-sum retiree payments under a new contract 
with the United Auto Workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Chrysler's U.S. sales are up 7.5 percent this year, thanks  
mostly to a 10 percent increase in truck and SUV sales. 
</P>
<P>
	David Garrity, an analyst with Dresdner Kleinwort Benson in New  
York, said much of Chrysler's profit can be traced to the strong 
sales of two SUVs -- the Jeep Grand Cherokee and the Dodge Durango. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you take away those two products, light-truck sales are  
basically flat,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mercedes-Benz and Smart car division had revenues of $9.8  
billion, a 15 percent increase over last year. Sales of 
Mercedes-Benz passengers cars were up 7 percent in the quarter, and 
12 percent for the first nine months of the year. Sales of the 
compact Smart car, available only in Europe, totaled 51,300 in the 
first nine months. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler said it made $1,612 on each vehicle sold in the  
past three months. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no question this was a significant positive  
surprise,'' said analyst Scott F. Merlis of Wasserstein Perella 
Securities Inc. ``DaimlerChrysler is one of the few companies in 
the world that has so much excess demand for such high-profit 
products.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The results were a reversal of last quarter, when  
DaimlerChrysler announced lower-than-expected earnings, even though 
U.S. car buyers are on track to set an all-time record for yearly 
sales. The company said losses due to the Smart cars, a weak euro 
and trouble in Latin America dragged profits down. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's commercial vehicles division had operating  
earnings of $322 million, a slight increase over last year. Its 
services division posted a 7 percent gain in operating earnings, 
from $279 million to $299 million. Those results exclude a one-time 
gain of $943 million from the sale of a stake in a 
telecommunications company. 
</P>
<P>
	Aerospace unit Dasa said its operating earnings were $197  
million, an increase of 30 percent, despite a slight drop in 
revenues. DaimlerChrysler announced earlier this month that Dasa 
would merge with a French company, Aerospatiale Matra to form the 
European Aeronautic, Defense and Space Co. 
</P>
<P>
	For the year so far, DaimlerChrysler has earned $4.9 billion, or  
$4.92 a share, an increase of 12 percent over last year, on revenue 
of $115 billion. For the same period in 1998, it earned $4.4 
billion, or $4.65 a share, on revenue of $103.4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler forecast continued strong growth in profits and  
revenues, saying revenues for all of 1999 were expected to increase 
about 11 percent over 1998, to $155 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Other one-time charges affecting earnings included the sale of a  
stake in the European telecommunications company debitel. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of DaimlerChrysler rose 75 cents to $76 in trading on the  
New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Wife of Los Lobos Member Missing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROWLAND HEIGHTS, Calif. (AP) -- A steady stream of friends and  
family brought food and support to Los Lobos singer-guitarist Cesar 
Rosas as he awaited word on the search for his wife, who has been 
missing for two days. 
</P>
<P>
	Sandra Ann Rosas, 47, was last seen by her daughters Saturday  
night. Her half-brother was arrested Monday for investigation of 
kidnapping after police found her abandoned van. 
</P>
<P>
	Her husband said all was well when he called his wife from New  
Orleans, where the band was on tour the night she disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
	``We spoke and everything was cool at home,'' Rosas said.  
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Rosa's burgundy-colored van was found empty Monday about 15  
miles from her home in Rowland Heights, an unincorporated community 
in eastern Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheriff's detectives combed through the vehicle before arresting  
39-year-old Gabriel Gomez. He was identified as a parolee but his 
record was not released. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Rosas was last seen at home by her three daughters about  
8:30 p.m. Saturday. When they returned about 11 p.m., they found 
the front door open, her van gone and broken glass from the vehicle 
in the driveway, said Deputy Boris Nikolof. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the daughters called her mother's cell phone and  
overheard a conversation between Mrs. Rosa and someone who sounded 
like Gomez that led the girl to believe her mother was being held 
against her will, Nikolof said. 
</P>
<P>
	Eleven-year-old Melanie Mullen, a friend of one of the  
daughters, said Gomez sometimes lived in a trailer at the back of 
the Rosas house. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was so nice to me every time I saw him,'' she said. ``They  
seemed like they were really close.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The disappearance interrupted the band's tour in support of its  
latest album, ``This Time,'' a mixture of rhythm-and-blues, guitar 
rock, Mexican ballads and other Latin-based styles. 
</P>
<P>
	The group has had a series of well-received albums but is best  
known for its recording of several of Ritchie Valens songs on the 
soundtrack ``La Bamba,'' the 1987 film about Valens' life.

<HEADLINE> Court To Review Electrocutions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- The Supreme Court agreed Tuesday to  
consider the constitutionality of electrocution for the first time 
in more than a century, granting an open-ended reprieve to a man 
scheduled for execution Wednesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision is likely to stop the use of the electric chair in  
Florida for months. 
</P>
<P>
	The high court's decision came nearly four months after a bloody  
execution -- the third botched electrocution in Florida this decade. 
In 1990 and 1997, flames erupted from the headpiece worn by the 
condemned killer. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida is one of only four states in the nation that require  
execution by electrocution. The only time the Supreme Court has 
considered whether electrocution can be used as a method of 
execution was in 1890, when New York became the first state to 
approve use of an electric chair. 
</P>
<P>
	The Supreme Court decision came less than an hour after the  
Florida Supreme Court granted Anthony Bryan a two-day stay to 
pursue federal appeals. Bryan was scheduled to go to the electric 
chair at 7 a.m. Wednesday for the 1983 murder of a Mississippi 
watchman. 
</P>
<P>
	Bryan's state lawyer, Andrew Thomas, called the decision hear  
the appeal of the electric chair ``monumental.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Jeb Bush was surprised and disappointed.  
</P>
<P>
	``From our perspective, it's unfortunate the family members of  
the victims have to wait for justice,'' spokesman Cory Tilley said, 
adding that Bush still has confidence the chair will operate 
properly. 
</P>
<P>
	Bryan's execution had been the second scheduled for this week.  
The state Supreme Court gave condemned killer Terry Sims, 
originally set for execution Tuesday morning, a week-long reprieve 
on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The last man to die in Florida's electric chair was Allen Lee  
``Tiny'' Davis, whose execution in July for the 1982 murders of a 
pregnant Jacksonville woman and her two young daughters led to a 
legal challenge of electrocution. 
</P>
<P>
	He suffered a nosebleed just before the current was applied,  
causing blood to drip from his face mask and onto his chest as he 
was electrocuted. Davis may also have been partially suffocated 
before he was electrocuted because of the placement of a leather 
mouthpiece across his face.

<HEADLINE> Canada News War Reshapes Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- A few days before the release of crucial figures  
showing who is winning the great Canadian newspaper war, modern-day 
press baron Conrad Black already was celebrating. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have changed the country,'' he boomed to hundreds of  
National Post employees at the paper's first birthday party 
Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	In a country with a rich and vibrant newspaper tradition --  
Toronto alone has four major dailies -- the launch of the National 
Post on Oct. 27, 1998, set off a wild year of competition. 
</P>
<P>
	While some question both Black's tactics and whether the new  
paper is as successful as he claims, no one doubts that Canada's 
newspaper industry has been permanently altered. 
</P>
<P>
	The respected Globe and Mail, the incumbent national daily, has  
undergone a thorough facelift to take on the National Post's 
modern, colorful design. Competition in the crucial Toronto market, 
where advertising decisions get made, is so fierce that analysts 
estimate on some days up to 100,000 copies were given away. 
</P>
<P>
	Industry readership figures and the National Post's first audit  
figures, expected in the next several days, are likely to evoke 
even greater changes. According to industry speculation and 
reportedly leaked numbers published in a Canadian news magazine, 
the National Post is grabbing some readers from the Globe and Mail 
and Toronto Star -- particularly upscale, educated young 
professionals. 
</P>
<P>
	If true, the figures will cause advertising dollars to shift.  
</P>
<P>
	``Advertisers don't just look at readership, they look at  
quality of readership,'' noted Bill Wolfenden, a communications and 
media analyst for Dundee Securities Corp. ``I think the figures are 
certainly going to set the stage for some interesting lobbying.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No matter what the numbers show, participants in the newspaper  
war say it has brought both good and bad. 
</P>
<P>
	Many insist the energy and quality of Canadian newspapers have  
improved, with the national opponents struggling to out-scoop each 
other and local publications forced to raise their standards. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been terrific for the business that way,'' said Christie  
Blatchford, a National Post columnist with more than 20 years' 
experience at other Toronto dailies. 
</P>
<P>
	Print reporters in Toronto benefited financially from the advent  
of the National Post, observed Vince Carlin, a former Canadian 
Broadcasting Corp. manager who is chairman of the School of 
Journalism at Ryerson Polytechic University. 
</P>
<P>
	``They paid well to get good people,'' Carlin said, mentioning a  
popular rumor that just being seen at lunch with a National Post 
editor brought an immediate raise. ``Even the people who didn't get 
offers got raises.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Phillip Crawley, the Globe and Mail publisher and chief  
executive officer, noted that the competition made the newspaper 
industry ``the story of the year in Canada.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he lamented what he called the ``economics of the  
madhouse,'' which caused newspapers to be given away, advertising 
and subscription rates to be slashed, and costs to rise well above 
normal levels. 
</P>
<P>
	He blamed Black, whose Hollinger International owns more than  
100 dailies including The Daily Telegraph in London, The Jerusalem 
Post and Chicago Sun-Times, for abandoning sound business practices 
in his quest for success. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Post has indicated it will lose at least $37  
million this year, said Wolfenden. Hollinger issued a profit 
warning for its third quarter due to lower than expected 
advertising revenue at the paper. 
</P>
<P>
	``The key thing will be whether the Post can increase its  
advertising,'' Wolfenden said, warning that it also must show it 
can retain subscribers lured by cut-rate prices -- as low as $4 a 
month -- in markets outside Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to see them start successfully weaning people from  
that hugely discounted price,'' he said. ``I think advertisers are 
going to want to see that too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Black didn't seem worried at the National Post birthday party.  
He and publisher Donald Babick promised good news from the 
readership and audit figures, and Black thanked the staff for 
virtually drawing even with the ``national institution'' of the 
Globe and Mail in several cities outside Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Globe and Mail, Crawley said circulation has remained  
above 300,000 a day and ad revenue meets or exceeds expectations. 
But he conceded that the National Post forced quicker changes to 
what was once known as the ``old, gray Globe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the past 18 months, it has adopted color photos and graphics,  
emboldened its design and introduced separate sports, entertainment 
and lifestyle sections. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are the trends taking place wherever you go,'' he said.  
``I'm sure we pressed the gas pedal a bit harder.''

<HEADLINE> Grammer Recovers From Appendectomy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ``Frasier'' star Kelsey Grammer was  
recovering at home Tuesday from an emergency appendectomy that 
forced his TV series to suspend production. 
</P>
<P>
	Grammer, 44, who plays psychiatrist Frasier Crane on the NBC  
comedy, fell ill last week and was admitted to a Los Angeles area 
hospital Friday, said series co-producer Paramount Network 
Television. 
</P>
<P>
	He was released the following day from the hospital, which was  
not identified. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is doing well and is at home recuperating with his wife,''  
the studio said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Filming on ``Frasier'' will resume late next week.  
</P>
<P>
	Grammer started feeling under the weather last week while  
directing an episode of ``Frasier'' that features Bebe Neuwirth as 
his ex-wife, Paramount said. The show is set to air in November. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, appendicitis also struck Tim Allen,  
Grammer's co-star in the upcoming film ``Toy Story 2.'' Allen, who 
was hospitalized for a week, has fully recovered, a spokeswoman 
said Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Game 3 Loss A Bad Sign for Braves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Everything was going according to plan for the  
Atlanta Braves to make this a competitive World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	Suddenly, it all fell apart.  
</P>
<P>
	Now, the Braves find themselves all but buried in a 3-0 hole, as  
the New York Yankees rallied from a 5-1 deficit to beat Atlanta 6-5 
on Chad Curtis' 10th-inning homer Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	One more loss, and the Braves get to spend another offseason  
trying to figure out how they came up short once again in the 
postseason, a decade of excellence impaired by only one World 
Series title. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a tough loss,'' manager Bobby Cox said. ``We were  
going to get back in this thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the night, the Braves were following the perfect script  
to put a roadblock in front of the Yankees' seemingly unstoppable 
run to another championship. 
</P>
<P>
	After a lost weekend at Turner Field, in which Atlanta managed  
only seven hits and three runs in two dreary losses, the Braves 
spent their off day taking some extra batting practice at Yankee 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	It paid off. Every starter had at least one hit, including three  
straight doubles by Bret Boone, who just happened to be one of 
three players benched for Game 2 in a futile attempt to jumpstart 
the offense. 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves were patient -- often working the count to three balls  
-- and made a concentrated effort to hit to the opposite field. By 
the fourth inning, they had knocked out New York starter Andy 
Pettitte. At the end, they had five runs and 14 hits. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Glavine, meanwhile, produced an effort belying his fragile  
health. The left-hander was supposed to start Game 1, but wound up 
watching from bed with a debilitating case of stomach flu. 
</P>
<P>
	The bug knocked seven pounds off Glavine's slender frame, and he  
was still a few pounds short of his normal weight when he walked to 
the mound three days later than expected. At least some of the 
color had returned to his face, a ghastly shade of pale just a day 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the day, Cox expressed confidence that Glavine could  
come through with seven solid innings. The left-hander did, walking 
to the dugout at that prescribed moment with a 5-3 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Unfortunately for the Braves, Cox sent Glavine back to the mound  
for the eighth. Two batters later, the two-run cushion was gone, 
wiped out by Joe Girardi's single and Chuck Knoblauch's two-run 
homer that barely cleared the wall and deflected off the glove of 
leaping right-fielder Brian Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
	Considering Glavine's fragile health and Tino Martinez's solo  
homer in the seventh, the decision by Cox was surprising to say the 
least. In the end, it probably cost the Braves any chance to rally 
in this Series. 
</P>
<P>
	Two innings later, Curtis put the Braves out of their misery  
with his second homer of the game, a mammoth shot into the Atlanta 
bullpen on the third pitch from reliever Mike Remlinger. 
</P>
<P>
	Curtis was carried off on the shoulders of his teammates, while  
the Braves trudged off the field with Frank Sinatra's rendition of 
``New York, New York'' and chants of ``Sweep! Sweep! Sweep!'' 
ringing in their ears. 
</P>
<P>
	This wasn't part of the plan.

<HEADLINE> Clemens, Smoltz Prepare for Game 4 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- For John Smoltz, the task in Wednesday night's  
Game 4 of the World Series is exceedingly simple. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to approach Game 4 as absolutely my last game to  
pitch because that's the way you have to approach it at this time 
of the year,'' he said Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Unless, of course, Atlanta manager Bobby Cox decides to use him  
in relief. Cox has done that before and Smoltz, baseball's 
winningest postseason pitcher with a 12-3 career record, is ready 
for those contingencies. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unlike the regular season, 3-and-1, 2-and-0, you challenge  
guys more than you don't,'' Smoltz said. ``You take calculated 
risks in a regular season. You don't try to approach each game to 
throw 140 pitches. You try to economize and pitch within the 
confines of the game. The simple fact is you know you've got a lot 
of games in a regular season to pitch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And now?  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if I'll get a chance to pitch again,'' Smoltz  
said. ``So I approach all my postseason games to where I can take 
the luxury of throwing 130 pitches and maybe a seven- or 
eight-inning game. You don't have to do that in the regular season. 
There's no 3-and-0 right down the middle, thinking they're taking 
it this time. You basically approach each hitter as a rally. Two 
outs, man on first, it's a rally now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smoltz went 11-8 during a season in which he reinvented himself.  
After two stretches on the disabled list, he changed his delivery 
and the pain in his elbow disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm an aggressive pitcher,'' he said. ``I like to throw  
strikes. With my new delivery, I'm going to try to change arm 
angles and pitches. If I walk them, I walk them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smoltz, 2-1 in seven World Series starts, will face five-time Cy  
Young Award winner Roger Clemens, who struggled to a 14-10 record 
in his first season with the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	Cox said Clemens' so-so season is hardly a consideration.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's not your ordinary pitcher,'' the Braves manager said.  
``He's getting a little older but he still throws great. If his 
control is on, you're in for a tough night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees traded for Clemens during spring training.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's gone out for the most part with good stuff,'' manager Joe  
Torre said. ``He put pressure on himself, tried to be perfect and 
dug himself a good hole.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That said, Torre still trusts Clemens.  
</P>
<P>
	``Every time I put his name in the lineup card, I expect a good  
outing,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens last pitched in a World Series in 1986 when he started  
two games for the Boston Red Sox and had no decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	``It went by so fast,'' he said. ``(That) was years ago. This is  
the here and now. It's a whole different situation. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's special for it to happen. Around here, it's almost a way  
of life and they expect it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll be keyed up and channel my emotions in a good way.''

<HEADLINE> Golf Mourns Death of Payne Stewart  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	There was never any mistaking Payne Stewart.  
</P>
<P>
	Not with the fancy clothes that brought images of golf at the  
turn of the 20th century. Not with that gorgeous, relaxed swing 
that brought him three major championships and respect in the five 
continents on which he won. 
</P>
<P>
	When Stewart put his mansion in Orlando, Fla., up for sale, one  
prospective buyer was Michael Jackson. The pop singer had no idea 
who the owner was until his manager told him Stewart was the golfer 
in the colorful knickers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh,'' Jackson said. ``That guy.''  
</P>
<P>
	Stewart was so much more. He embodied the spirit of the Ryder  
Cup. He played with grit and he won with grace. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Stewart boarded a Learjet 35 that he co-owned for  
Dallas to consider a golf course design project. The plane flew 
uncontrolled for hours before crashing in South Dakota, killing 
Stewart and at least four others aboard. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was one of the most terrible tragedies of modern-day  
golf,'' said Arnold Palmer, a former neighbor when Stewart lived in 
the Bay Hill development of Orlando. 
</P>
<P>
	Jack Nicklaus, who feared one of his golf course designers was  
also on the plane, recalled the graceful swing, indomitable spirit 
and contagious humor. 
</P>
<P>
	``Payne was just coming into his own, and it is truly saddening  
that he has been lost in his prime,'' Nicklaus said. ``He will be 
sorely missed by anyone who ever knew him or had the pleasure of 
watching him play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps Tiger Woods best summed up the shock that hit the PGA  
Tour on Monday when news spread that Stewart was dead at age 42. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is an enormous void and emptiness I feel right now,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also on the plane were two agents from Leader Enterprises --  
Robert Fraley, the chief executive officer whose clients included 
New York Jets coach Bill Parcells, and president Van Arden. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicklaus said Bruce Borland, 40, was believed to be on the same  
flight. Borland's wife said she talked to an employee who had 
greeted her husband at the private jet airport and confirmed he 
intended to board the flight. 
</P>
<P>
	After a stop in Dallas, Stewart was on his way to the Tour  
Championship in Houston, the end-of-the-year tournament for the top 
30 money-winners. Stewart was No. 3 on the money list at just over 
$2 million, his best season ever. 
</P>
<P>
	The pro-am today at Champions Golf Club was canceled. The tour  
said his spot in the field will not be replaced. 
</P>
<P>
	A blue ribbon was attached to his nameplate in the parking lot.  
</P>
<P>
	``It is difficult to express our sense of shock and sadness over  
the death of Payne Stewart,'' PGA Tour commissioner Tim Finchem 
said. ``This is a tremendous loss for the entire golfing community 
and all of sports.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Disbelief followed praise as word spread through the tight-knit  
community of professional golfers that spans the oceans. 
</P>
<P>
	``A true sportsman on the course and a gentleman off it,'' said  
Masters champion Jose Maria Olazabal, choking back tears. ``We have 
lost a precious man and someone who still had good years ahead of 
him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Curtis Strange was leaving a news conference in Palm Beach  
Gardens, Fla., where he was named Ryder Cup captain for 2001, when 
he saw the first television reports. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have lost someone who is truly a great ambassador for the  
game,'' Strange said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart's finest moment in a 20-year professional career came on  
Father's Day at Pinehurst No. 2, the famed course in North Carolina 
that became a stage for great drama. 
</P>
<P>
	A year after Stewart lost a four-stroke lead in the final round  
of the U.S. Open at The Olympic Club, he trailed Phil Mickelson by 
one stroke with three holes to play, then one-putted the final 
three greens for a stunning victory. 
</P>
<P>
	His 15-foot par putt on the last hole was the longest ever to  
decide the Open in its 105-year history. Stewart thrust his fist in 
the air, an unforgettable image, let out a roar and later broke 
down in tears. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a great credit to golf and to our country,'' said  
former Masters and U.S. Open champion Billy Casper. ``Golf lost a 
great man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Open secured a spot in the Ryder Cup for Stewart, who  
could wear the Stars and Stripes as easily as his knickers. He 
never apologized for his patriotism, something he carried to all 
five of his Ryder Cup appearances. 
</P>
<P>
	While Stewart had an edge to him at times, and was especially  
surly during an eight-year slump during which he won only once, he 
never lost his respect for golf's traditions. 
</P>
<P>
	He stood up for Colin Montgomerie as the boorish Boston crowd at  
The Ryder Cup hurled vicious insults at the Scotsman. With the cup 
already decided, Stewart conceded Montgomerie's final putt. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had a real reverence for the game,'' Peter Jacobsen said.  
``As a golfer, his record speaks for itself. He was loved by many 
people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Born Jan. 30, 1957, in Springfield, Mo., Stewart went to SMU in  
Dallas. He graduated with a business degree in 1979 and spent two 
years playing around the world. He met his wife, Tracey, while 
playing in Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	They had two children -- Chelsea, 13, and Aaron 10.  
</P>
<P>
	Stewart's first breakthrough came in 1989 when he won his first  
major, the PGA Championship, at Kemper Lakes outside Chicago. Two 
years later, he won the U.S. Open at Hazeltine by defeating Scott 
Simpson in an 18-hole playoff. 
</P>
<P>
	He reflected on his career last week before the Disney Classic,  
where he missed the cut. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were times when ... I played very poorly and I wasn't  
having fun playing golf, and I didn't want to continue,'' he said. 
``I had a wakeup call to the fact that this is what I'm good at, 
and I'm still good at it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Part of his turnaround was a newfound faith, drawn to church  
through his children. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a lot older and I'm a lot wiser. I'm more mature,'' he  
said earlier this year. ``I'm not going to blink and miss my family 
growing up. When I'm out at the golf course, I'm going to prepare 
myself to be the best I can. And when I'm home, I'm going to be a 
father.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also said his faith in God had blossomed. ``I'm so much more  
at peace with myself than I've ever been in my life,'' Stewart said 
after winning the Open. ``Where I was with my faith last year and 
where I am now is leaps and bounds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart won more than $11.7 million in a PGA Tour career that  
began in 1980. He was ranked No. 8 in the world and was third on 
this year's money list with just over $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart had planned to go to Spain next week for the final World  
Golf Championship event, and still had the Grand Slam of Golf next 
month for the winners of this year's major championships. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is shocking. It's a tragedy. I can't even comprehend the  
scope of it,'' Woods said. ``None of us can right now.''

<HEADLINE> Songwriter Accused of Child Abuse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- A successful songwriter who was an adoptive  
and foster father of 28 children surrendered to police Tuesday 
after five boys in his care accused him of sexual abuse. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas Cusick was charged with multiple counts of corruption of  
a minor, indecent assault and child endangerment. If convicted, he 
could receive up to 35 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Cusick, 47, was released on $300,000 bail. No preliminary  
hearing date was set. 
</P>
<P>
	His lawyer, Kevin M. Zlock, did not return phone calls seeking  
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Cusick's songs include ``Don't You Go,'' recorded by Ricky  
Martin. His songs also have been recorded by artists including 
Lionel Richie, Tony Orlando, Barry Manilow and Neil Diamond, 
prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1972, Cusick has been an adoptive or foster father to 24  
boys and four girls in Pennsylvania and New York, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Since January 1998, Cusick and several boys and young men have  
lived in a seven-bedroom house in an affluent subdivision of 
Langhorne, about 20 miles northeast of Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	Cusick, who has no prior criminal record, was married briefly in  
the early 1980s but adopted most of the children when he was 
single, authorities said. He received several awards and letters of 
commendation from adoption advocacy groups and community service 
programs, Bucks County District Attorney Alan M. Rubenstein said. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation started a month ago when a 17-year-old adopted  
son made the first allegations to police, Rubenstein said. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities then interviewed four other boys, between the ages  
of 8 and 16, who reported similar assaults, Rubenstein said. Most 
were adopted at about 8 or 9 years old from Downey Side, a 
respected agency that finds homes for New York City children deemed 
hard to place. 
</P>
<P>
	The five were among 11 boys, all minors, who were removed from  
the house shortly after the investigation began and placed in 
foster care, Rubenstein said. Two other adopted sons, both 19, 
moved out of the house Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Police arriving at Cusick's home to arrest him Monday found that  
he and a woman described as a live-in housekeeper had already 
cleared out their belongings, police Detective Andy Amoroso said. 
There was no word where Cusick was until his surrender on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Charges also could be filed in New York, according to the  
district attorney's office on Staten Island. At least one assault 
took place there, according to court documents.

<HEADLINE> Tour To Postpone Two Events Friday  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Competition in two PGA Tour events will be  
postponed Friday because of a memorial service for Payne Stewart,

<HEADLINE> Cox Had Close Eye on Glavine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Maybe it was the low pitch count. Maybe it was  
the easy way he had handled the hitters. Maybe it was just the 
courageous job Tom Glavine had done through seven innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever the reason, Atlanta manager Bobby Cox decided to try to  
squeeze one more inning out of the left-hander in Tuesday night's 
Game 3 of the World Series against the New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	Glavine not only didn't get one more inning. He didn't even get  
one more out. 
</P>
<P>
	Braves reliever Mike Remlinger couldn't get any outs in the 10th  
inning, either, as the Yankees won 6-5 on a home run by Chad 
Curtis. 
</P>
<P>
	Glavine had thrown just 73 pitches through seven innings, a  
remarkably low total. He had shown no ill effects from the flu that 
kept him in bed over the weekend and prevented him from starting 
Game 1 of the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	Cox kept close tabs on his starter but Glavine seemed  
comfortable, pitching easily even after allowing home runs by Chad 
Curtis and Tino Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
	So with closer John Rocker throwing in the bullpen, Cox sent  
Glavine out for the eighth. It was a bad mistake. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Girardi lined the left-hander's first pitch of the inning,  
No. 74 of the game, to right field for a single. Still, Cox stayed 
in the dugout. 
</P>
<P>
	Next was Chuck Knoblauch. Pitch No. 75 was outside for a ball  
and so was pitch No. 76. Cox never moved. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, with the count in his favor, Knoblauch had the edge on  
Glavine. He swung at pitch No. 77, sending it toward the right 
field wall. 
</P>
<P>
	Brian Jordan went back as far as he could and jumped as high as  
he could. The ball hit his glove and caromed over the wall for the 
two-run home run that tied the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Glavine never got a chance to throw pitch No. 79.

<HEADLINE> Mother Charged in Girl's Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONG PRAIRIE, Minn. (AP) -- A mother was charged Tuesday with  
murdering one of her daughters and trying to kill the other by 
deliberately driving into a lake. 
</P>
<P>
	Lisa Patchen, 28, was spotted wet and shivering on the shore of  
Lake Latimer in northern Minnesota on Sunday morning. Emergency 
crews found her daughters, Amber Johnson, 6, and Allysha Johnson, 
7, floating unconscious about 300 yards from where the car was 
submerged in 5 1/2 feet of water. 
</P>
<P>
	Amber was pronounced dead a short time later. Allysha survived  
but was in critical condition Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The girls were found one day before the five-year anniversary of  
the notorious drowning of Susan Smith's two children in a South 
Carolina lake. Ms. Smith is serving life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	A judge ordered Ms. Patchen jailed on $500,000 bail Tuesday. She  
is to be evaluated at a state security hospital to assess whether 
she is competent to stand trial. 
</P>
<P>
	The girls' father and Ms. Patchen's longtime boyfriend, Philip  
Johnson, told investigators that she had a nervous breakdown last 
summer and stopped taking her anti-psychotic medication about a 
month ago. He said she became depressed and threatened to kill 
herself. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said an ambulance worker who arrived at the lake  
Sunday asked Ms. Patchen what happened. ``They were pulling me 
under so I had to do it,'' she allegedly replied. 
</P>
<P>
	While sitting in a hospital waiting room later Sunday, Ms.  
Patchen told an investigator that she had driven the car into the 
water. ``When he asked her why she drove it there, she said that it 
was to drown,'' the complaint against her said. Prosecutors did not 
elaborate.

<HEADLINE> 49ers Young May Be on Injured List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- Steve Young appears headed for the  
injured reserve list because of persistent post-concussion 
symptoms, a move that would finish his season and could signal the 
end of his career. 
</P>
<P>
	No formal decision has been made yet, but the agent for the San  
Francisco 49ers quarterback said Tuesday he doesn't intend to let 
Young play again this year and apparently the team and Young's 
doctors feel the same way. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm determined he not risk anything more this year,'' Leigh  
Steinberg said in an interview with San Francisco's KCBS radio. 
``He's probably going to end up on injured reserve. This is a 
football injury. He was hurt on the field and that's where those 
players go. 
</P>
<P>
	``But the news is not encouraging. It's not real cheery.  
Obviously, to show symptoms this many weeks later is not a positive 
sign.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 38-year-old Young is expected to discuss his condition and  
status with the team on Wednesday in a meeting with the media. It's 
his first such meeting in two weeks since word surfaced that his 
primary neurologist, Dr. Gary Steinberg, who is unrelated to the 
agent, had made a longterm recommendation about whether Young 
should play again. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he'll be able to clear some things up, be a little  
more definitive,'' coach Steve Mariucci said. ``Is anything drastic 
going to happen? No.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Dr. Steinberg's opinion hasn't been disclosed, Young has  
conceded the report was ``discouraging'' and his agent has said 
that the initial medical opinion has been reaffirmed in 
consultations with other specialists. 
</P>
<P>
	Young continues to speak with some of his contemporaries who  
were forced out of the game by repeated concussions, including Al 
Toon and Merrill Hoge. He's also gathering more medical advice and 
may see another specialist this week but Mariucci and general 
manager Bill Walsh have both said that they would give greatest 
weight to Dr. Steinberg's conclusions and they are in no hurry to 
see Young back on the field. 
</P>
<P>
	The concern with Young is he could be at risk for permanent  
brain damage from another concussion. 
</P>
<P>
	Mariucci said Monday that the team, which has a bye this week,  
hopes to resolve Young's status in the next week or two and said 
injured reserve was a possibility. It would allow Young an extended 
period away from football while not totally shutting the door on 
his eventual return. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Young has not received medical clearance to play and has  
no real hope of getting it any time soon, he remains optimistic 
that his concussion symptoms will eventually clear, leaving at 
least a possibility he could return next season. 
</P>
<P>
	Leigh Steinberg said there would be no decision or announcement  
on the possibility of Young's retirement until after the season but 
added that Young also will abide by the final medical consensus. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing is going to happen in the way of retirement this  
season,'' Leigh Steinberg said. ``He will come to the right 
decision but this will take a little time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Young continues to feel a strong sense of responsibility to the  
team, especially now that it's struggling without him, and wouldn't 
think of leaving in the middle of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	By going on injured reserve, though, he could stick around and  
get treatment while remaining with the team as a locker room and 
sideline presence along with helping advise his replacement, Jeff 
Garcia.

<HEADLINE> Families Unhappy With Kid's Schools </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A third of the households with children in  
Cleveland and Oakland, Calif., are unhappy with their neighborhood 
elementary schools, and one-fifth of those families in those cities 
are so dissatisfied they want to move because of their schools, a 
survey found. 
</P>
<P>
	Generally, however, parents across the nation view their schools  
favorably, according to a survey being released today by the 
Educational Testing Service. It said that in more than 
three-fourths of the cities surveyed, fewer than 10 percent of 
households indicated they wanted to move because of poor school 
quality. 
</P>
<P>
	Some observers say the report suggests there is a market -- be it  
small -- for vouchers that give parents public funds to send their 
children to private schools. Cleveland is in the midst of a court 
battle over its four-year-old voucher program. 
</P>
<P>
	The Educational Testing Service, a Princeton, N.J.-based testing  
and research organization, analyzed 1990-1996 Census data from 55 
of the nation's largest cities. 
</P>
<P>
	In those cities least satisfied with public education, children  
were more likely to attend private schools. In all the 55 cities, 
many of the dissatisfied families already had opted out of public 
schools. Among the dissatisfied households with children ages 5-13, 
between 13.6 percent and 63.7 percent currently enroll their 
children in private schools, depending on the city. 
</P>
<P>
	But 10 percent of families satisfied with the public schools  
still send their children in private schools. 
</P>
<P>
	School satisfaction differed greatly between inner cities and  
their suburbs. The greatest differences were in the Buffalo, N.Y., 
and Rochester, N.Y., and Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan areas, 
where four times as many city as suburban households were unhappy 
with their public elementary schools. 
</P>
<P>
	In Birmingham, Ala., Chicago, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Dallas,  
Memphis, Milwaukee and New Orleans, the percentage of satisfied 
black parents was one-third greater than the percentage of 
satisfied white parents. Hispanic families tended to be more 
satisfied with the public education.

<HEADLINE> Vermeil: I'll Coach Two More Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Dick Vermeil is talking retirement, but not in  
the near future. 
</P>
<P>
	The St. Louis Rams head coach plans to honor his current  
contract, which runs through the 2001 season, and then retire. 
</P>
<P>
	After struggling to 5-11 and 4-12 records in Vermeil's first two  
seasons in St. Louis, the Rams are on a roll. At 6-0, they're are 
the NFL's only undefeated team. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the 62-year-old Vermeil says he'll have no problem  
walking away if the program is successful at the end of his 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the program is running real good, I'll feel I've  
accomplished something,'' Vermeil said Monday. ``But that's a long 
ways away from right now. I've seen playoff coaches get fired the 
next year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vermeil also said he wants to extend the contracts of his  
coaching staff through the 2001 season. Most members of his staff 
are working in the final year of three-year deals.

<HEADLINE> A Reform Party Primer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- The Reform Party was best known as the  
party of Texas billionaire founder Ross Perot and Minnesota Gov. 
Jesse Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, it has two new marquee names: former Republican firebrand  
Pat Buchanan, who on Monday announced his candidacy for the Reform 
presidential nomination, and New York developer Donald Trump, who 
registered for the party but hasn't committed to a White House bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Here's a primer on the party that has drawn Buchanan and Trump.  
</P>
<P>
	Q: How did the Reform Party start?  
</P>
<P>
	A: The party grew out of Perot's 1992 presidential bid and was  
preceded by his United We Stand, America. The party's first 
national convention was in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: Who controls the party?  
</P>
<P>
	A: The party has four main factions, those headed by Perot,  
Ventura, 1992 independent presidential candidate Lenora Fulani, and 
the unaligned. 
</P>
<P>
	The current chairman is Russell Verney, a top aide to Perot.  
Many still believe Perot controls the party through Verney. Perot 
hasn't spoken about the party publicly since the July national 
convention. 
</P>
<P>
	Incoming Chairman Jack Gargan of Cedar Key, Fla., was elected in  
July with the support of Ventura and has a plan to shift the power 
away from Perot. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: How does the Reform Party choose its presidential nominee?  
</P>
<P>
	A: The Reform Party -- and its presidential candidate -- are  
assured of being on the ballot in 21 states. Anyone seeking the 
nomination must petition in the other 29 and Washington, D.C., to 
gain ballot access. 
</P>
<P>
	On July 1, 2000, party leaders will decide which candidates have  
put a serious effort into the petitioning drive. Those candidates' 
names will go on the nominating ballot. The ballots will go to 
party members and those who sign petitions or express interest in 
the party. The ballots will be counted at the national convention, 
scheduled for Aug. 10-13 in Long Beach, Calif. To receive the 
nomination, the winner must receive one vote more than 50 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: Is there potential for trouble with open balloting?  
</P>
<P>
	A: Gargan thinks so. He wants to change the rules when he takes  
office Jan. 1. He will seek to limit voting, perhaps to party 
members and those who sign a candidate's petition. Another coming 
battleground is the site of the convention. Gargan and other 
Ventura supporters want it in Minnesota and will seek the change 
after Gargan takes office. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: Why does the Reform Party qualify for federal money?  
</P>
<P>
	A: The Reform Party nominee will receive $12.6 million in the  
2000 presidential election because Perot received more than 5 
percent of the vote as a candidate in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: Will Perot run again?  
</P>
<P>
	A: He's not saying. Some believe Perot will step in at the last  
minute, thwarting the other candidates, much as he did to former 
Colorado Gov. Richard Lamm in 1996. Others point to the public 
support his former running mate Pat Choate has given to Pat 
Buchanan. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: What does the Reform Party stand for?  
</P>
<P>
	A: The party is mostly known for a push for a balanced budget,  
repayment in full of the federal debt and trade restrictions. The 
party platform includes a call for electoral, lobbying and campaign 
finance reforms. It urges ``tolerance of the customs, beliefs, and 
private actions of all persons which do not infringe upon the 
rights of others.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The party's candidates have tended to be neutral on social  
issues such as abortion, gay rights and prayer in schools. Some 
party activists describe it as a party of common sense and describe 
themselves as radical moderates. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: Who are the party's past presidential nominees?  
</P>
<P>
	A: Perot was the nominee in 1992, when he received 19 percent of  
the vote, and in 1996, when he received 8 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: Who is the highest elected party official in the country?  
</P>
<P>
	A: Ventura is the first and only Reform Party candidate to be  
elected statewide. He won the Minnesota gubernatorial election in 
1998. No members of Congress are Reform Party members. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: Will Ventura run for president?  
</P>
<P>
	A: He has said repeatedly he doesn't want the job and he wants  
to keep his promise to Minnesotans to serve out his four-year term. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: Where are the party's geographical strengths?  
</P>
<P>
	A: Perot did well south and west of Mississippi, but not in the  
Northeast. The party's organization is strongest in California, 
Florida, Minnesota, Mississippi, New York, Texas and Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: What is the American Reform Party?  
</P>
<P>
	A: A splinter group of the national party. The group's leader,  
Ted Muga, said that group would join the national party only with 
assurances that Buchanan would not receive the party's presidential 
nomination.

<HEADLINE> Court To Review Electrocutions Electric Chair%xhl) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                         *By JACKIE HALLIFAX 	
</P>
<P>
                      *Associated Press Writer    	
</P>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- The U.S. Supreme Court agreed Tuesday  
to consider the constitutionality of electrocution for the first 
time in more than a century, halting the use of Florida's electric 
chair. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision grants an open-ended reprieve to a man scheduled  
for execution Wednesday morning and another that had been scheduled 
to be electrocuted Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The high court's decision came nearly four months after a bloody  
execution -- the third botched electrocution in Florida this decade. 
In 1990 and 1997, flames erupted from the headpiece worn by the 
condemned killer. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys for death row inmates have tried unsuccessfully in  
state courts to prove that death in the electric chair violates the 
ban on cruel and unusual punishment. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida is one of only four states in the nation that require  
execution by electrocution. The only time the U.S. Supreme Court 
has considered whether electrocution can be used as a method of 
execution was in 1890, when New York became the first state to 
approve use of an electric chair. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Supreme Court decision came less than an hour after the  
Florida Supreme Court granted Anthony Bryan a two-day stay to 
pursue federal appeals. Bryan was scheduled to go to the electric 
chair at 7 a.m. Wednesday for the 1983 murder of a Mississippi 
watchman. 
</P>
<P>
	Bryan's state lawyer, Andrew Thomas, called the decision  
``monumental.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Jeb Bush was surprised and disappointed.  
</P>
<P>
	``From our perspective, it's unfortunate the family members of  
the victims have to wait for justice,'' spokesman Cory Tilley said, 
adding that Bush still has confidence the chair will operate 
properly. 
</P>
<P>
	The last man to die in Florida's electric chair was Allen Lee  
``Tiny'' Davis, whose execution in July for the 1982 murders of a 
pregnant Jacksonville woman and her two young daughters led to a 
legal challenge of electrocution. 
</P>
<P>
	He suffered a nosebleed just before the current was applied,  
causing blood to drip from his face mask and onto his chest as he 
was electrocuted. Davis may also have been partially suffocated 
before he was electrocuted because of the placement of a leather 
mouthpiece across his face. 
</P>
<P>
	Bryan, 40, is condemned for the 1983 murder of George Wilson, a  
60-year-old watchman who was abducted in Pascagoula, Miss., and 
killed in a remote area in the western Florida Panhandle county of 
Santa Rosa. 
</P>
<P>
	The electric chair reached its peak of popularity 50 years ago  
when it was the method of execution in 26 states. But no state has 
adopted electrocution since 1949. Most have abandoned it in favor 
of lethal injection. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida lawmakers, however, have remained devoted to the  
electric chair. Republican House Speaker John Thrasher said he 
found the U.S. Supreme Court's decision ``terribly frustrating.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thrasher said he would be willing to call a special legislative  
session if lawmakers could figure out a way to ``carry out the law 
of the land'' without waiting for the high court to rule. A way to 
do that, he suggested, might be passing a law to give death row 
inmates a choice between the electric chair and lethal injection.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Industrial Output Falls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese industrial production declined 0.8 percent  
in September from August, dragged down by drops in output of 
machinery and plastics, the government said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ministry of International Trade and Industry said it expects  
output to fall 0.9 percent in October from September but then 
increase 3.8 percent in November. 
</P>
<P>
	The decline in September follows a surge of 4.6 percent in  
August from July, the strongest monthly increase since January 1997 
when production rose 5.3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The September decline, measured after adjustment for seasonal  
factors, matched the forecasts of economists surveyed by Dow Jones 
Newswires. 
</P>
<P>
	Sectors that contributed most to the decline were general  
machinery, electric machinery and plastic products. Production of 
printing machinery, personal computers and steam turbine parts 
fell, partly in response to the sharp rises in August. 
</P>
<P>
	Automobile and other transportation equipment remained strong  
even after the 8 percent month-on-month output rise in August, MITI 
said.

<HEADLINE> Senator Questions Navy Deployment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate will hold an emergency hearing to  
question deployment of a Navy battle group to the Mediterranean if 
the ships are not allowed to undergo live-fire training in Puerto 
Rico, the Senate Armed Services Committee chairman said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Congress is not going to sit by'' while American military men  
and women head into the field unprepared for battle, Sen. John 
Warner told the Joint Chiefs of Staff. 
</P>
<P>
	Gen. Henry Shelton, the Joint Chiefs chairman, repeated the  
military's contention that the Puerto Rican island of Vieques is 
the only site available for Atlantic fleet combined training of 
air, sea and land forces with live bombs. 
</P>
<P>
	As the battle group led by the aircraft carrier USS Eisenhower  
undergoes other training in the region, the Pentagon is weighing a 
decision on whether to continue using Vieques over the protests of 
Puerto Rican authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if Congress is not in session when a decision is made on  
deployment of the Eisenhower battle group, Warner told Shelton he 
would call a special hearing to ``evaluate your professional 
judgment on the readiness of that battle group.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Navy concern over preparedness is heightened by the fact that  
the last two aircraft carriers deployed from the Atlantic Fleet 
ended up participating in combat operations. The USS Enterprise 
engaged in attacks against Iraq from the Persian Gulf and the USS 
Theodore Roosevelt flew combat missions in Kosovo from the 
Mediterranean. 
</P>
<P>
	The Navy suspended training on its Vieques range after protests  
over the death of a civilian guard, David Sanes Rodriguez, in a 
bombing accident on the island April 19. 
</P>
<P>
	A Pentagon-appointed panel concluded that the Navy should resume  
limited training but phase out use of the range over five years. 
Training remains suspended, however, pending a decision by Defense 
Secretary William Cohen and President Clinton. Puerto Rican demand 
that the facility be returned for civilian use. The island has 
9,400 civilian residents. 
</P>
<P>
	An administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity,  
said Cohen was planning to meet in Washington later this week with 
Puerto Rican leaders to seek a solution to the standoff over use of 
Vieques. 
</P>
<P>
	The official said the administration hoped a deal could be  
reached at the table. ``Everybody has their fingers crossed,'' the 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shelton said personnel with the Eisenhower, scheduled to be in  
the Mediterranean in December, could not be prepared with a high 
level of confidence unless they can conduct training that simulates 
real-life situations. 
</P>
<P>
	The Navy said earlier the ships would be in ``a significant  
reduced state of readiness'' if crews could not undergo the 
realistic training. The battle group steamed out of Norfolk, Va., a 
month ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``We should not deploy under those conditions,'' Shelton said.  
But he stopped short of saying he would not deploy if the forces do 
not receive the Vieques training. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is time for the Puerto Rican government to sit down with  
the Department of Defense'' to see where accommodations can be 
made, he said.

<HEADLINE> Bush Courts Hispanics in Ads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush mingled  
general election themes with Republican primary politics in 
unveiling an initial wave of campaign advertising that includes 
newspaper and radio spots targeting Hispanics. 
</P>
<P>
	Bracing for the potential of attacks by Republican rivals, he  
pledges in one spot to avoid ``mud throwing and name calling'' and 
warned rivals that voters tire quickly of such slashing. 
``Americans are sick of that kind of campaigning,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	But in another, he pledges ``a fresh start for America,'' a  
theme that could resonate with voters tired of scandals in the 
White House. Underscoring that point, two of the new commercials 
end with Bush hugging his wife Laura. 
</P>
<P>
	Aides on Monday unveiled a package of four television  
commercials that will begin airing today in Iowa and New Hampshire, 
in which Bush uses folksy settings to pledge tax cuts, a focus on 
education and saving Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	Those aides declined ``for strategic reasons'' to disclose the  
amount being spent on the initial advertising drive, but the 
intensity level in Iowa could cost about $50,000 a week. 
</P>
<P>
	Campaign aides said the television campaign ``is a mid-sized  
one,'' with the average person in Iowa and New Hampshire seeing the 
spots three to five times a week. 
</P>
<P>
	Money is not an issue for Bush, who has raised far more than any  
of his rivals and is not subject to state spending limits because 
he has declined federal matching funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Rival Steve Forbes has been running campaign commercials for  
weeks, and also has refrained from attacking his rivals. 
Nevertheless, Bush aides are worried about the slashing assaults 
Forbes ran in the last election cycle. The wealthy publisher also 
is unfettered by spending limits. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bush television spots feature footage of Bush walking in a  
parade, speaking from the stump and mingling with children in 
school classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
	An underlying theme throughout is that Bush claims he wants to  
run an upbeat campaign without criticizing his rivals. One 
commercial features images of a casually dressed Bush relaxing on a 
couch and making the point that voters are tired of constant 
assaults. 
</P>
<P>
	``What they want to hear is what's on people's minds and where  
the candidates' hearts are,'' said Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	Aides said the commercials would augment the organizational work  
being done in the two key early states. Iowa's leadoff precinct 
caucuses are Jan. 24, followed eight days later by the New 
Hampshire primary. 
</P>
<P>
	The campaign previewed the commercials for rank-and-file GOP  
House members in Washington, as well, at a session with Karl Rove, 
the governor's chief strategist. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush aides also unveiled a 60-second radio commercial and  
newspaper ads being run in Spanish-language publications in Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's been a tremendous outreach,'' said media adviser  
Stuart Stevens. ``You're not going to see a campaign where we're 
running a different campaign on the ground than on the air.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Spanish commercial notes ``the spotlight is on Iowa.'' It  
adds, ``And for the first time it's shining on the Latino 
community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Hispanic voters make up less than 2 percent of the Iowa  
electorate, they represent 11 percent of the nation's voters, and 
an even higher percentage in California, Texas, Illinois, New York 
and Florida, the five biggest electoral states. 
</P>
<P>
	Paying attention to Hispanics in key early states isn't lost on  
voters around the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Kathy Sosa, who helped produce the Spanish spots, said the  
strategists were expanding on the organizational focus in important 
early states. 
</P>
<P>
	``The governor can't look at every single Iowan,'' Sosa said.  
``There are too many Iowans and only one candidate.''

<HEADLINE> Walton's Son Chooses San Diego St. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Chris Walton, the youngest son of Hall of Famer  
Bill Walton, has turned down a scholarship offer from UCLA and 
verbally committed to play for coach Steve Fisher at San Diego 
State. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have explored all my options and know it is the best place  
for me,'' the 6-foot-8 Walton told the San Diego Union-Tribune. ``I 
have 100 percent confidence that Coach Fisher is going to turn the 
program around. I've had a great experience from the moment he 
began recruiting me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher took over San Diego State's sad-sack program in March  
after Fred Trenkle resigned following a 4-22 season. The Aztecs 
have had just one winning season in the last 14 years. 
</P>
<P>
	NCAA rules prohibit Fisher from commenting until players sign  
letters of intent. 
</P>
<P>
	Walton is a senior at the University of San Diego High. His  
father led UCLA to two national championships before starring in 
the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure my dad would have been extremely happy had I chosen  
UCLA, but I also know he would never want me to be someplace I 
wasn't happy,'' Chris Walton said. ``He has always wanted us to 
make our own decisions.

<HEADLINE> EBay Results Beat Expectations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Online auction house eBay Inc. reported its  
third-quarter operating profits beat Wall Street expectations as 
new partnerships and expanded auction offerings such as cars and 
art led to a sharp increase in its registered users. 
</P>
<P>
	For the three months ended Sept. 30, San Jose, Calif.-based eBay  
reported net income of $1.35 million, or 1 cents a share, up from 
$476,000, or break-even, the comparable period a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The company took charges during the current quarter for stock  
compensation plans and acquisitions. Excluding those, operating 
income was $3.2 million, or 2 cents a share, compared to $1.8 
million, or 2 cents a share, the same period a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	EBay makes money by charging auctioneers for listings and taking  
a percentage of each sale. The results beat Wall Street 
expectations of 1 cents a share, according to a survey of analysts 
by First Call/Thomson Financial. 
</P>
<P>
	EBay's stock tumbled $10.37 1/2 to $141.62 1/2 in after-hours trading  
on Instinet after the auctioneer reported unexpectedly heavy 
expenses. The company's stock rose $1.12 1/4 to $152 a share during 
normal trading hours, before its earnings were released. 
</P>
<P>
	The company reported its registered users increased 509 percent  
from the same time last year, to 7.7 million from 1.3 million, with 
a record 2.1 million added in the most recent quarter. The number 
of auctions increased 292 percent to 36.2 million from 9.2 million 
in the previous comparable quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Meg Whitman, eBay's president and chief executive, said the  
company's decision to expand its auction site to include premium 
and high-end items such as collector cars is helping keep it ahead 
of increasing competition who are ``all trying to muscle in on the 
large online market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Despite the recent wave of competitive efforts, I am pleased  
to report that eBay's leadership position remains firm and 
unchallenged,'' she said in a conference call. 
</P>
<P>
	EBay said it has added staff and redundant computer systems to  
try to prevent outages that have plagued its site. The company also 
is expanding to provide local auctions and service in large 
European markets. Total operating expenses were $46.2 million in 
the latest quarter, compared with $15.5 million last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues jumped 169 percent to $58.5 million from $21.7 million.  
The company reported revenue from its auction subsidiaries fell 
during a seasonal lull, while costs of sales and marketing rose. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months of the year, eBay reported net income  
of $5.9 million, or 4 cents a share, from $4.6 million, or 4 cents 
a share. Revenues rose to $150.8 million from $55.2 million.

<HEADLINE> Jason Hervey, Wife Suing Chapel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Actor Jason Hervey and his wife are suing a Las  
Vegas wedding chapel for allegedly selling the couple's wedding 
photos to a tabloid newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	Hervey, 27, played Wayne Arnold on the TV series ``The Wonder  
Years,'' which aired from 1988 to 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	The actor and his wife, Shannon, filed their lawsuit Friday  
against The Little White Wedding Chapel and four individuals. 
</P>
<P>
	The Herveys paid the defendants to take photos of their private  
ceremony at chapel on Feb. 6, 1998, according to the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	The document claims the defendants kept pictures of the couple's  
ceremony and sold them without permission to The National Enquirer 
for $20,000. The pictures appeared in the tabloid on March 10, 
1998, according to the complaint. 
</P>
<P>
	Charlotte Richards, president of the corporation that owns the  
chapel, said the chapel did not provide The National Enquirer with 
the pictures. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would never sell people's photos,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Commissioner Wants Fine for Tyson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RENO, Nev. (AP) -- A member of the Nevada Athletic Commission  
wants the panel to take a tough stand and fine Mike Tyson for his 
punch after the bell Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The former heavyweight champion and his advisers also should get  
a ``strong'' letter from the commission condemning Tyson's actions 
against Orlin Norris, commissioner Luther Mack said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Norris went down from the late blow after the first round, hurt  
his knee and couldn't continue. The fight was declared a no 
contest, and Tyson's $8.7 million purse is being withheld pending a 
commission hearing Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would be in favor of some kind of fine based on what I saw  
and how the fight took place,'' Mack said. ``I don't have a number 
in mind. It has to be a sum that he knows we're serious. We have to 
make sure we protect the integrity of boxing. We have to take a 
strong stand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mack, a Reno businessman, said referee Richard Steele has right  
to declare no contest. The ruling was made after a consultation 
between Steele, ringside physician Dr. Flip Homansky and commission 
members. 
</P>
<P>
	Steele also called the punch an accidental foul, and that is why  
Tyson was not disqualified. His license was revoked for about 14 
months and he was fined $3 million after he bit Evander Holyfield's 
ears in the third round June 28, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission released Norris' purse, but it withheld Tyson's  
share. Because of a managerial cut, an IRS lien and legal action, 
Norris was paid only a little more than $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Another member of the five-man commission, Glenn Carano of Reno,  
said he won't make up his mind about what action should be taken 
until the matter is brought up in public. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm about as displeased with the outcome of the fight as any  
other fan,'' Carano said. ``You wish a Mike Tyson fight would not 
end with a controversial situation. ... Things just seem to follow 
Mike Tyson around.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mack said he's concerned about the boxing future of the  
33-year-old Tyson. 
</P>
<P>
	``He doesn't have too many years left,'' Mack said. ``He has to  
do a good job if he wants to keep fighting. To do this is a little 
insulting. This didn't have to happen.''

<HEADLINE> Patty Hearst Shaw To Testify </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Patty Hearst Shaw, the newspaper heiress who  
was kidnapped in the 1970s by the radical Symbionese Liberation 
Army, has been ordered to testify at the bombing conspiracy trial 
of former SLA fugitive Sara Jane Olson. 
</P>
<P>
	A trial brief released Monday revealed that a judge in  
Connecticut, where Ms. Hearst Shaw lives, ordered her appearance as 
a prosecution witness at Ms. Olson's trial, which is scheduled to 
begin in January. Ms. Hearst Shaw's lawyer, George C. Martinez, 
said ``she is not happy about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Olson, formerly Kathleen Ann Soliah, was not associated with  
the SLA in February 1974, when Ms. Hearst Shaw, then 19 and known 
as Patty Hearst, was abducted by the group from her Berkeley 
apartment. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors allege that Ms. Olson became involved with the SLA a  
few months later, after six SLA members were killed in a fire and 
shootout with Los Angeles police. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Olson is accused of plotting to avenge the SLA deaths by  
killing police officers with nail-packed pipe bombs planted under 
squad cars. The devices did not explode. Ms. Olson spent 23 years 
as a fugitive before being arrested this summer in Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	In her book ``Every Secret Thing,'' Ms. Hearst Shaw says Olson  
accompanied two SLA members to Los Angeles to plant the bombs. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Olson's attorney Stuart Hanlon said Tuesday that prosecutors  
plan to build their case ``90 percent on Patty Hearst and her 
book.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If one really had a case dealing with a bombing conspiracy,  
the case would fix on that,'' Hanlon said. ``This seems like a very 
desperate act by a desperate prosecutor. It seems the evidence 
involving bombings is nonexistent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Victoria Pipkin, a spokeswoman for the district attorney's  
office, said the brief ``maps out our case,'' but she added, ``we 
intend to proceed with this case in the courtroom and not in the 
media.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference Tuesday in Minneapolis, Ms. Olson -- free on  
$1 million bail -- claimed prosecutors are trying to put the SLA on 
trial again, 25 years after the Hearst kidnapping. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am being tried not for what I'm accused of but for the  
crimes of the SLA and for events with which I have not even been 
affiliated, including the kidnapping of Patricia Hearst,'' she 
said.

<HEADLINE> Tribute Paid to Stewart in Europe  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The U.S. flag was at half-staff at the home of  
golf in St. Andrews, Scotland, on Tuesday following the death of 
Payne Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
	Colin Montgomerie, Seve Ballesteros and Jose Maria Olazabal,  
were among the European players to pay tribute to Stewart, singling 
him out for his sportsmanship during last month's contentious Ryder 
Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart died Monday when the Learjet he was aboard flew  
uncontrolled for hours and crashed in South Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars and Stripes was raised over the Old Course at St.  
Andrews, the Scottish seaside town where the sport was born. 
Stewart played at St. Andrews three weeks ago in the Dunhill Cup, 
where the U.S. team lost in the third round. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have raised the Stars and Stripes along with our flag in  
memory of Payne,'' said a spokeswoman for the St. Andrews Links 
Trust, which runs the six courses in the town. ``It is a very sad 
day for golf and St. Andrews in particular.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Flags were also lowered in Virginia Water, the town near London  
where the European Tour is based, and at the Montecastillo course 
in Spain, where the Volvo Masters begins Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart was a regular visitor to Europe and recently had been  
appointed honorary captain of Waterville Golf Club in Ireland for 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a very approachable person,'' said Peter Huggart,  
president of the Waterville club and owner of the Butler's Arms 
Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never saw him turning away young kids. ... He used to come  
into the hotel for a sing-song at night. ... He was very good on 
the harmonica. He used to travel with eight or 10.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart was a member of the U.S. Ryder Cup team that beat Europe  
14 1/2-13 1/2 last month in Brookline, Mass. The match was marked by a 
premature celebration by American players and their wives on the 
17th green, and by the heckling by U.S. fans of the European 
players. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Dunhill Cup, Stewart went out of his way to socialize  
with the European players, listening to their complaints and trying 
to defuse the fallout. 
</P>
<P>
	Europe's Ryder Cup captain, Mark James, described Stewart as  
``one of the good guys, a gentleman and good fun to be with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Montgomerie, Europe's leading money winner for six straight  
years, recalled how Stewart had spoken out against the abuse he had 
received at the Ryder Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	``Above all, I respected his approach to the game and none more  
so than at Brookline,'' Montgomerie said. ``In those extraordinary 
circumstances, it takes a big man to stand up and be counted and 
Payne Stewart was certainly that and I shall always be grateful to 
him for his support. I shall miss him very much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Montgomerie played Stewart on the final day of the Ryder Cup.  
After the Americans rallied to regain the Cup, Stewart conceded his 
match to Montgomerie on the final hole. That was seen as a grand 
gesture of sportsmanship. 
</P>
<P>
	Other European Ryder Cup players, in Jerez, Spain, for the Volvo  
Masters, had only good memories of Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
	Ballesteros called him ``a good friend of golf and everybody''  
and recalled sitting up with him late one night at Dublin's K Club. 
</P>
<P>
	``We ate well, drank a good bottle of wine,'' Ballesteros said.  
``He was interested in everything and it was easy to talk with him. 
The news has left us speechless.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Olazabal was to join Stewart in the Grand Slam of Golf,  
featuring all four of this season's major winners, in Hawaii next 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing is sufficient to is express what a great person we  
have lost,'' Olazabal said. ``He was a great player, an excellent 
sportsman on and off the field. He was honest and fair.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Olazabal said his last memory of Stewart was at the Dunhill Cup.  
</P>
<P>
	``I was with Sergio Garcia ... and we'd brought some Spanish  
cured ham and Spanish cheese and we offered some to the Americans 
at the table next to us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is great,'' he recalled Stewart saying. Stewart said he  
looked forward to having more Spanish food at the Nov. 4-7 World 
Golf Championships at Valderrama, Spain. 
</P>
<P>
	``He always made an effort to say a few words to us in Spanish  
... and the times I took my mother to the Ryder Cup he always came 
up to her and said something nice in Spanish.''

<HEADLINE> GOP Criticizes Social Security Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican leaders dismissed Social Security  
legislation that President Clinton sent to Capitol Hill on Tuesday 
with a fresh volley of criticism. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not a realistic proposal,'' said Senate Majority  
Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss. ``I've heard this proposal described as 
the Godzilla of all shell games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the House, Ways and Means Committee chairman Bill Archer,  
R-Texas, said ``This plan won't save Social Security, it denies 
Americans the opportunity for personal accounts, and it places a 
huge burden on the backs of future generations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Escalating the rhetoric in the ongoing budget battle between the  
White House and Congress, Clinton said in his Saturday radio 
address that he would send lawmakers the Social Security 
legislation this week. It formalizes a Social Security rescue plan 
he first outlined in his State of the Union Address. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal would earmark for baby boomers' retirement benefits  
any government savings from using Social Security surpluses to pay 
off the national debt. 
</P>
<P>
	The official version Clinton delivered to Congress on Tuesday  
dropped a particularly controversial provision that would also have 
let the government invest some of the retirement program's cash 
reserves in the stock market. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Republican leaders, who had previously rejected  
Clinton's plan and declared discussion of it dead for the year, 
were not swayed by that change. 
</P>
<P>
	Both political parties have pledged this year not to spend  
Social Security surpluses as in the past, but to use the money 
instead to pay down the national debt. That would allow the 
government to save billions it would otherwise have to pay in 
interest. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's plan would use those savings, which would presumably  
accrue in the form of income tax surpluses, to help pay Social 
Security benefits after baby boomers retire. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans, who want to see tax cuts in coming years, have  
objected to the fact that Clinton's plan would give Social 
Security, which has traditionally been financed with a separate 
payroll tax, a claim on other tax revenues. 
</P>
<P>
	Many GOP lawmakers and some moderate Democrats would prefer to  
try to raise extra money for retirement benefits by letting 
Americans invest some Social Security taxes in individual stock 
market accounts.

<HEADLINE> GTE Sells Oklahoma Phone Properties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IRVING, Texas (AP) -- GTE said Tuesday it has agreed to sell its  
telephone exchanges and about 120,000 customer access lines in 
Oklahoma to dba Communications, a newcomer to the 
telecommunications industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Privately-held dba Communications already had agreed to buy GTE  
properties in Texas and New Mexico. The three acquisitions total 
about $1.7 billion and will close in mid-2000, GTE leaders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dba was formed by a group of Hispanic investors, mostly from New  
Mexico, and three venture-capital firms. The company said Tuesday 
it will move its headquarters from Washington, D.C., to Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale nearly completes an effort by Irving-based GTE, which  
Bell Atlantic is acquiring, to sell 1.6 million local phone lines 
and shift its focus into emerging technologies. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're simply shedding about 7 percent of our local phone lines  
across the country and using the proceeds to invest in 
higher-growth activities, such as wireless, data and Internet,'' 
said spokesman Bill Kula. 
</P>
<P>
	GTE is still negotiating to sell about 100,000 local customer  
lines in Illinois and could announce a deal next month, Kula said. 
It has sold lines in 12 states since May. 
</P>
<P>
	Dba Communications gets 27 telephone exchanges in the Oklahoma  
deal, which also includes 140 GTE employees. When the deal closes, 
dba Communications will have about 520,000 customer-access lines 
and more than 500 employees. It is among the 20 largest U.S. local 
phone-service companies, according to an industry group. 
</P>
<P>
	Dba's investors include former New Mexico Gov. Toney Anaya,  
former U.S. Interior Secretary and New Mexico Congressman Manuel 
Lujan Jr. and 10 other Hispanic businessmen. 
</P>
<P>
	In trading Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange, GTE's shares  
fell 18 3/4 cents to $71.50.

<HEADLINE> Defendant Uses `Gay Panic' Defense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LARAMIE, Wyo. (AP) -- The alleged ringleader in the beating death  
of college student Matthew Shepard has adopted a ``gay panic'' 
defense, a somewhat risky strategy that has had little success in 
recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	In opening statements on Monday, Aaron McKinney's lawyer argued  
that McKinney snapped after a sexual advance from Shepard triggered 
memories of a homosexual assault by a childhood bully. The lawyer 
also contended McKinney was under the influence of drugs and 
alcohol at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense is hoping to save McKinney's life by convincing the  
jury that he is guilty of manslaughter instead of murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Legal analysts said the defense has an uphill battle because of  
key evidence that indicates premeditation, such as taking Shepard 
to a remote spot to rob him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if this will be effective. If you assert the gay  
panic defense, you have to have the facts to support that,'' legal 
analyst Andrew Cohen of Denver said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Brian Levin, director of the California-based Center on Hate and  
Extremism, said McKinney's lawyers will have to proceed carefully. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jurors want to see some type of contrition, some possible  
explanation for the crime, but they don't want to see a victim 
blamed,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last October, Shepard was lashed to a wood fence in a remote  
area, robbed of $20 and pistol-whipped into a coma. He died five 
days later. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said McKinney led the charge. His co-defendant,  
Russell Henderson, pleaded guilty to murder and kidnapping in April 
and is serving two life sentences. Henderson is expected to 
testify. 
</P>
<P>
	During testimony on Tuesday, Coroner Patrick Allen said the  
young man's skull was fractured a half-dozen times and some of the 
blows may have been inflicted with the butt of a .357 revolver. 
</P>
<P>
	Shepard also apparently tried to ward off the blows, suffering  
bruises on his hands, arms and body. ``These were significant, 
serious blows that required a significant amount of force,'' Allen 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Homosexual panic'' is built on the theory that a person with  
latent homosexual tendencies will have an uncontrollable, violent 
reaction when propositioned by a homosexual. 
</P>
<P>
	Ralph Slovenko, a professor of law and psychiatry at Michigan's  
Wayne State University, said challenging a person's sexuality can 
be more disruptive than religious or racial insults. 
</P>
<P>
	Levin said the strategy has been meeting with less success in  
recent years because Americans have become more tolerant of 
homosexuals. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel we've turned a very big corner in that nearly everyone  
agrees that violence against them is completely wrong,'' he said. 
``I don't think you had the same type of atmosphere 20 or 30 years 
ago.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The defense has been used in several trials, with limited  
success. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1992 in Toronto, a 19-year-old man was acquitted of fatally  
stabbing his boss. He claimed he was in fear for his life and 
operating out of homosexual panic. 
</P>
<P>
	In Alabama, Steven Eric Mullins, 24, used the defense but was  
convicted of capital murder in the Feb. 19 slaying of Billy Jack 
Gaither, who was beaten with an ax handle and his body burned atop 
kerosene-soaked tires. 
</P>
<P>
	In Pontiac, Mich., Jonathan Schmitz used the defense after he  
fatally shot a gay acquaintance who revealed a crush on him during 
a taping of ``The Jenny Jones Show.'' He was sentenced in September 
to 25 years to 50 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Jonathan Schmitz case was a perfect example where  
introducing elements of homosexual panic won him a second-degree 
conviction instead of a first-degree conviction,'' said Jeffrey 
Montgomery, executive director of the Detroit-based Triangle 
Foundation, a gay rights organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Montgomery complained that the tactic amounts to blaming the  
homosexual victim. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors typically counter gay panic defenses by asking  
juries to focus on the time that the perpetrator had before 
carrying out the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	In the McKinney case, the prosecution will emphasize how long it  
took McKinney and Henderson to drive Shepard from a downtown 
Laramie bar several miles to a trail leading to the rocky foothills 
east of town.

<HEADLINE> Candidates Spend, Win No Delegates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- It's a chilling stat for the lesser-funded  
Republican presidential candidates: Even with no delegates at 
stake, George W. Bush and Steve Forbes each spent at least $800,000 
to compete in the Iowa straw poll. 
</P>
<P>
	The other GOP candidates, who are getting taxpayer help for  
their campaigns in exchange for limiting their spending, can spend 
a total of about $1.1 million in the state. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush and Forbes, who have declined the federal funds, can spend  
as much as they want in their quests for the Republican 
presidential nomination. Since July, Bush has spent more than $4 
million per month from his record-breaking campaign treasury while 
the self-financed Forbes has spent $3.5 million monthly. 
</P>
<P>
	The money that the Bush and Forbes campaigns each estimate was  
spent on the nonbinding straw poll is two-thirds of the total that 
candidates who accept federal matching funds are allowed to spend 
in Iowa. Because Bush and Forbes aren't accepting the money, they 
don't have to abide by the spending limits. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush won a decisive first place with 7,418 votes, at a cost of  
about $108 for each. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes placed second with 4,921 votes, spending about $160 for  
each. 
</P>
<P>
	According to his campaign finance report, Bush spent $279,450 on  
tickets, each costing $25. Many went unused. He chartered $82,532 
worth of buses to get voters to the polls. He paid $43,500 for a 
prime spot near the polling place for a campaign tent, where he fed 
supporters $64,719 worth of pork barbecue. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes spent $8,000 to rent his site and $81,110 on buses,  
hiring some from Kansas, Minnesota and Wisconsin. He spent $192,500 
on tickets and served 9,000 barbecue meals at a cost of $27,589. 
</P>
<P>
	In contrast, conservative activist Gary Bauer, who finished  
fourth, reported spending $12,275 on tickets -- enough to cover 
about one-fourth of his 2,114 voters -- and $4,700 on rent. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a lot of people pay their own way,'' Bauer campaign  
manager Frank Cannon said. 
</P>
<P>
	Former American Red Cross President Elizabeth Dole, who spent  
$5,500 on rent and didn't report buying any tickets, finished third 
with 3,410 votes. She recently withdrew from the presidential race, 
saying it came down to ``money, money, money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush and Forbes campaign officials said they got their money's  
worth in Ames. 
</P>
<P>
	``You had to be competitive,'' Forbes campaign manager Bill Dal  
Col said. ``That's how you get your viability.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, disappointing finishes in Ames contributed to two  
candidates' decisions to quit the Republican race: former Tennessee 
Gov. Lamar Alexander, who came in sixth, and former Vice President 
Dan Quayle, who was eighth. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush needed to win to meet skyrocketing expectations.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was an early test of our organization in the state,'' Bush  
campaign spokeswoman Mindy Tucker said. ``It showed us we were 
doing something right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the well-heeled Bush and Forbes campaigns, there were other,  
bigger expenses for the quarter that ended Sept. 30, according to 
campaign reports filed with the Federal Election Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush -- who has raised a record $57 million thus far this year --  
spent $2.4 million to attract more donations, and $1 million to 
process incoming checks. 
</P>
<P>
	He spent almost $500,000 on charter airplanes, $1.7 million on  
payroll, and $26,554 on polling. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush also spent $1 million on TV ads that are now starting to  
air in Iowa and New Hampshire, site of the nation's first contests. 
The campaign also produced commercials designed to look like an 
opponent's attack ads for test purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, Bush spent $12.8 million over the three months, compared  
with $10.6 million by Forbes. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes spent $1.5 million on radio and television ads, $1  
million on direct mail and telemarketing, and $264,336 on polling. 
He spent $337,431 to operate the campaign Web site, which features 
simulcasts of Forbes campaign events and online chats. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the start of the campaign, Bush has spent almost $20  
million while Forbes is close behind at almost $19 million. 
Candidates who receive federal funds are limited to spending around 
$40 million through next summer.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Voters To Decide on ATM Fees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A proposal to ban those $1 or $2 ATM  
surcharges goes before voters for the first time next month in San 
Francisco, setting the stage for a court battle. 
</P>
<P>
	There is little doubt the ban will pass, but it is certain to  
face a legal challenge from the banking industry, which contends 
that federally chartered banks are not subject to local and state 
laws. No court in the nation has ruled specifically on an ATM fee 
ban. 
</P>
<P>
	San Francisco's initiative is the latest sign of growing  
consumer outrage over the cash-machine fees, which are usually 
charged when customers withdraw money from a bank other the one 
where they hold an account. 
</P>
<P>
	The surcharges averaged $1.20 in a 1998 study by the Federal  
Reserve and have become almost universal across the country in the 
last three years. 
</P>
<P>
	In Southern California, Santa Monica city officials have already  
passed a ban on surcharges. It takes effect Nov. 12. A dozen other 
California communities are considering bans, including Los Angeles 
and San Diego, said Jon Golinger of the California Public Interest 
Research Group, which has led the no-surcharge campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Connecticut and Iowa have used existing laws to ban ATM  
surcharges. And last week, the Pentagon said it would consider a 
ban on ATM fees on U.S. military bases. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress has thus far rejected legislation that would eliminate  
surcharges nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Banks say the charges are simply the price of 24-hour  
convenience and help pay for their growing networks of ATMs. But 
opponents say they fees are unjustifiable at a time of soaring bank 
profits, teller layoffs and branch closings. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why do they have to charge? They never did it before,'' asked  
Carney Campion, a San Francisco resident who tore up his ATM card a 
few weeks ago in frustration. 
</P>
<P>
	Golinger sees the San Francisco initiative as a way to  
accelerate efforts to get rid of the fees elsewhere. ``This is a 
bottom-up event,'' he said. ``In the end, surcharges will be banned 
just about everywhere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to a 1997 government report, the surcharges aren't  
needed to cover the costs of ATM transactions. The report said the 
average ATM transaction costs banks 27 cents, while transactions 
with tellers cost up to $2.93 each. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the banks argue that the fees help pay to install more  
ATMs, which are needed as cash-machine use increases and branches 
close. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a way of having non-customers share in the burden of  
maintaining that network,'' said California Bankers Association 
spokesman John Stafford. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Bankers Association warns that banning the fees  
would force banks to bar ATM use by non-account holders and shut 
down tens of thousands of the machines. 
</P>
<P>
	The chief legal argument against local surcharge bans is that  
only the federal government can regulate the ATMs of national 
banks, which operate 90 percent of the machines covered by San 
Francisco's initiative. 
</P>
<P>
	Each side in the legal dispute can point to favorable language  
in court decisions on related issues. 
</P>
<P>
	In Iowa, the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last month said  
federal law prohibits states from regulating national banks' ATMs. 
</P>
<P>
	But the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which covers  
California and eight other Western states, reached the opposite 
conclusion in 1990. In a ruling that predated ATM surcharges, the 
court said Congress ``has declined to restrict state regulation in 
the ATM context.''

<HEADLINE> Minnesota Bans Team From Postseason </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- The University of Minnesota decided today to  
hold its basketball team -- a Final Four participant in 1997 -- out 
of postseason play for one year because of alleged academic 
cheating in the program. 
</P>
<P>
	School president Mark Yudof believes the NCAA will impose more  
sanctions after it receives the university's final report on the 
investigation of the basketball program. 
</P>
<P>
	An investigation into the program began in March after former  
tutor Jan Gangelhoff claimed she did more than 400 pieces of course 
work for at least 20 basketball players from 1993 to 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation has since widened to include accusations of  
improper payments and travel irregularities, and alleged sexual and 
other misconduct in the men's athletics department. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must demonstrate good faith and take meaningful action to  
repair the damage that has been done by others,'' Yudof said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said it was a judgment call to impose sanctions that might be  
harsher than the NCAA's. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we do need to impose sanctions,'' he said. ``I don't  
hate to do it. It's the right thing to do. The NCAA has to worry 
about deterrents. I have to worry about deterrents in the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NCAA spokeswoman Jane Jankowski said the organization would not  
comment specifically on whatever sanctions Yudof announces. But she 
said it is appropriate and common for embattled schools to come up 
with their own sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Universities do frequently hand down their own penalties, and  
our (investigating) committee considers that and can adopt those 
sanctions, as well as add other penalties,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Clem Haskins resigned under pressure in June and accepted  
a $1.5 million buyout of his contract. He has said he had no 
knowledge of any academic cheating in the basketball program. 
</P>
<P>
	Dan Monson of Gonzaga University was hired to replace Haskins.  
</P>
<P>
	Yudof said he was trying to help Monson by imposing the  
sanctions now and trying to move forward. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm trying to make his life a little easier, his interactions  
with the team, boost morale a little bit,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Monson said the situation has ``made some difficult obstacles,  
but none that I didn't know when I took the job. ... For the staff 
and our team, it's the beginning of the end.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yudof said the university report probably will be completed Nov.  
10. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Boeing, Union Reach Tentative Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Boeing Co. and machinist union  
negotiators reached tentative agreement Tuesday on a new three-year 
contract that would provide a pay raise and increased benefits to 
nearly 2,200 employees in California and Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	The company and representatives of the International Association  
of Machinists and Aerospace Workers District 725 reached the 
proposed agreement hours after returning to the bargaining table. 
</P>
<P>
	Union members rejected an earlier proposal, which Boeing had  
called its ``best and final offer'' but contained smaller increases 
in pension and medical benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now it's in the hands of the membership. The union negotiating  
committee is unanimously recommending this package,'' said Nick 
Bacon, president of District 725. ``We feel it's enough to 
recommend the package.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing officials did not immediately return a call seeking  
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Union members were scheduled to vote on the proposed agreement  
Friday. It would apply to about 1,500 workers at Boeing's 
Huntington Beach, Calif., plant, plus a smaller number in Torrance, 
Calif., and at launch facilities at Vandenberg Air Force Base, 
Calif., and Cape Canaveral, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	Workers covered by the negotiations include lathe operators,  
machinists, electronic technicians, furniture movers and part 
inspectors. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement, employees' pay would rise 3 percent in the  
first and second years of the contract and 4 percent in the final 
year. The agreement also would boost pension payments to $48 per 
month for each year of service, up $3 from Boeing's previous offer. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing also had sought to boost employees' contribution to  
medical coverage by as much as 80 percent in some situations. Under 
the new agreement, there will be no increase in the first year and 
hikes of 10 percent in the second and third years. 
</P>
<P>
	Workers also would receive a flat $1,500 signing bonus.  
</P>
<P>
	Despite Boeing's concessions, the proposal does not equal a  
contract won in separate negotiations by Boeing's 44,000 machinist 
union members in Washington, Oregon and Kansas. Those workers will 
get a bigger increases in pay and pension benefits plus a larger 
signing bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	Workers have remained on the job at the California and Florida  
sites during the negotiations.

<HEADLINE> Explosive Device Injures 3 at MIT </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -- An explosive device detonated in the  
hands of a Massachusetts Institute of Technology student Tuesday, 
wounding him and two others in a Halloween prank gone awry. 
</P>
<P>
	At least one of the students was dressed in a Grim Reaper  
costume and carrying a plastic ax. He was part of a group from the 
Phi Kappa Sigma fraternity, which was promoting its Halloween party 
on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	As the students walked through the aisle of a lecture hall, a  
test tube-sized metal pipe filled with paper and an undetermined 
explosive material went off in the hands of an 18-year-old student, 
said Deputy Fire Chief Gerald Reardon. 
</P>
<P>
	``It appears to be, at this time, some sort of theatrical type  
of flash material that was used,'' Reardon said. ``It was just 
supposed to be a hoax or a gag to advertise something, and it 
obviously just went woefully wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The student, whose name was not released, was treated for hand  
wounds at a hospital and released a few hours later. Two others 
were treated at the MIT infirmary and released. 
</P>
<P>
	The building was evacuated and the police bomb squad called in.  
</P>
<P>
	MIT is well known for its pranks, or hacks, which date back at  
least to the 1920s. 
</P>
<P>
	Four years ago, hackers put a police car on top of the  
university's Great Dome. Another year, they dressed the dome in an 
enormous beanie topped with a propeller. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1982 prank was among the more memorable. Hackers dug a tunnel  
under the Harvard Stadium and launched an exploding black rubber 
balloon at the 50-yard line during the Harvard-Yale game.

<HEADLINE> Tyson Faces Friday Hearing on Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Mike Tyson might have hurt Orlin Norris and  
angered some fans by punching after the bell. However, Nevada 
boxing commissioners don't appear eager to take action on his 
latest ring antics. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nevada Athletic Commission will discuss Tyson's aborted  
fight with Norris at a Friday meeting, at which he is expected to 
get the $8.7 million purse that has been withheld pending a review 
of his fight with Norris. 
</P>
<P>
	Commissioners may fine Tyson for the late blow, but they are not  
expected to take any action to suspend Tyson from the ring or 
change the decision in the fight from a no contest to a 
disqualification. 
</P>
<P>
	Commission chairman Dr. Elias Ghanem does not view what happened  
Saturday as serious as Tyson's biting of Evander Holyfield's ears. 
That cost Tyson $3 million and got him banned from boxing. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there was a disqualification it would have been a different  
ball game,'' Ghanem said. ``When he (referee Richard Steele) 
deducted two points, that means the fight could continue. That's 
the big difference.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steele's ruling in the ring that the left hook that dropped  
Norris after the bell sounded was not deliberate may help Tyson 
avoid any penalties for the late blow, which ended the fight when 
Norris dislocated his knee on the way down to the canvas. 
</P>
<P>
	``The important thing is that it was an accidental foul and that  
was the determination that was made,'' said Marc Ratner, the 
commission's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Nevada law, which was changed in the wake of Tyson's  
biting of Holyfield, a boxer can be fined his entire purse for an 
infraction. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would be in favor of some kind of fine based on what I saw  
and how the fight took place -- a fine and a strong letter to Tyson 
and his advisers that this won't be tolerated,'' Commissioner 
Luther Mack said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He got $8.7 million. I dont have a number in mind (for a  
fine). It has to be a sum that he (Tyson) knows we're serious,'' 
said Mack, a Reno businessman. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to make sure we protect the integrity of boxing. We  
have to take a strong stand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson is not expected to attend Friday's commission meeting,  
which was called in the wake of the ending that caused fans to boo 
both fighters. 
</P>
<P>
	He said after the fight that he did not hear the bell, even  
though it rang five times as Steele moved in to try and separate 
the fighters in the middle of the ring. 
</P>
<P>
	Ratner said Monday there was no dispute that Tyson hit Norris  
after the bell, but he noted that hitting after the bell is 
relatively common in fights. Felix Trinidad did the same thing to 
Oscar De La Hoya twice in the middle rounds of their welterweight 
title fight last month, and was not penalized. 
</P>
<P>
	Steele took two points from Tyson after Norris went back to his  
corner. But the fight did not resume after Norris said he could not 
continue because of an injured knee. 
</P>
<P>
	An MRI showed his knee was dislocated, and doctors said Norris  
may need surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Norris said he did not think Tyson hit him deliberately after  
the bell. He said it was loud in the ring and hard to hear the 
bell.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Flies OK'd To Kill Fire Ants / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- Introducing a Brazilian fly to kill South  
American fire ants won't create a new ecological problem, Oklahoma 
officials say. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, researchers introduced the tiny flies in  
Bryan County in hopes of controlling the pesky fire ants, which 
have spread to southern Oklahoma in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Department of Agriculture researchers have studied the  
Phorid fly in detail and are certain it will kill only the fire ant 
and won't create any other environmental havoc, researchers said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The ants, which have infested 11 Southeastern states,  
aggressively swarm on any object that disturbs them. They are 
considered a threat to livestock, crops and people allergic to 
their sting. 
</P>
<P>
	Indigenous ants, which help control the fire ants, shouldn't be  
threatened by the tiny Brazilian fly, said Russell Wright, head of 
Oklahoma State University's Entomology and Plant Pathology 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
	``The ones we're introducing will only kill the fire ant,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials have cautioned against the widespread use of  
pesticides to eradicate the fire ant for fear that the chemicals 
would also kill native ants, Wright said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ants are territorial, so the native ants kill fire ants and also  
compete with them for food, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The female Phorid fly, or Pseudacteon tricuspis, is about  
one-sixteenth of an inch long and lives up to two weeks. It can 
kill about 200 fire ants by stinging them and depositing eggs in 
their bodies. 
</P>
<P>
	The fly larva grows and moves to the host's head where it  
matures and decapitates the fire ant. 
</P>
<P>
	It will take a year or more to get definable results from the  
initial release, Wright said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, officials are uncertain whether the flies can survive  
an Oklahoma winter. The insects have survived in warmer climates in 
Texas, Florida and other states, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire ants in the United States have flourished with  
densities five times that of their native South American habitat 
because they lack a natural enemy. The ants have infested about 240 
million acres in the South, from Florida to Texas. Texas alone 
spends more than $300 million a year controlling fire ants. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, the California Department of Food and Agriculture set  
aside $2.8 million in seed money to eradicate the ants, which were 
first spotted in Southern California a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire ants may have migrated from South America in the early  
1930s by a contaminated cargo shipment that landed in Mobile, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
	Oklahoma state and federal officials have quarantined eight  
southern Oklahoma counties -- McCurtain, Bryan, Marshall, Love, 
Carter, Choctaw, Johnston and Comanche. 
</P>
<P>
	Shipments of nursery plants, heavy equipment and some hay must  
be inspected before leaving the counties, said Don Molnar, program 
administrator for the Oklahoma Agriculture Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Inspecting shipments may only slow the ants' northern migration,  
he said, because reproducing fire ants can fly. 
</P>
<P>
	It remains to be seen how far north the fire ant can survive in  
winter, Wright said. There may be some in Oklahoma County now that 
could survive if their mounds are deep enough and near warmth and 
if the ants can find food.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Falls Against Yen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar fell against the yen Tuesday amid  
expectations that Japan may unveil a larger-than-expected 
economicstimulus package. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 104.69 yen,  
down from 105.31. 
</P>
<P>
	The yen has been on the rise amid expectations that Japan's  
economy may be on the rebound. Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa 
said Tuesday that an upcoming package of government spending 
measures may be larger than originally expected. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar rose against most other currencies, including the  
euro, which lost ground despite growing expectations that the 
European Central Bank may raise interest rates at its next meeting 
on Nov. 4. The euro was quoted at $1.0586 in New York, down from 
$1.0668 late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was quoted at 1.5122 Swiss francs, up from  
1.4974, and 1.4744 Canadian dollars, up from 1.4719. The British 
pound fell to $1.6532 from $1.6636. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on Tuesday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.8481 German 
marks, up from 1.8330; 6.1982 French francs, up from 6.1477; and 
1,829.60 Italian lire, up from 1,814.69.

<HEADLINE> Payne Stewart's Caddie Missed Flight  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEBANE, N.C. (AP) -- Spending a weekend with his family might  
have saved the life of the caddie who jumped into Payne Stewart's 
arms when he won the U.S. Open in Pinehurst. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Hicks frequently travels with Stewart, who died Monday with  
five other people when their Learjet crashed in South Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
	Hicks' mother, Faye, said her son probably would have been on  
the ill-fated flight, but that he had taken his family with him 
when he caddied for Stewart last weekend in the Disney Classic in 
Orlando, Fla. Hicks returned with his family to North Carolina 
before flying to Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	He already was in Texas on Monday, awaiting the arrival of  
Stewart so they could begin preparations for The Tour Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``He and Payne were very close. It's going to be hard,'' Mrs.  
Hicks said. 
</P>
<P>
	The day after Stewart won the 1999 U.S. Open in Pinehurst in  
June, he rode home with Hicks, and they celebrated the victory with 
champagne. The next day, Stewart played in a charity tournament 
Hicks had organized.

<HEADLINE> NYC Homeless May Work for Shelter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- For the first time, homeless people looking for  
housing in city shelters will have to work for it under a policy 
scheduled to take effect by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	The homeless who are able to work but fail to comply with the  
rule could be refused shelter, said Anthony Coles, an adviser to 
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. In the case of families, children could be 
put in foster care. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ultimately, the city is asking parents to take responsibility  
for themselves and to take responsibility for their children,'' 
Coles said in today's New York Times. 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear how the policy would be applied to the disabled  
or mentally ill. 
</P>
<P>
	The Giuliani administration is ready to apply the new rule to  
4,600 families in the city's shelter system in about 60 days. The 
administration expects the rule to also apply to 7,000 homeless 
single adults. 
</P>
<P>
	Many parents in city homeless shelters already work in exchange  
for welfare benefits while their children are in shelter day care. 
</P>
<P>
	The work requirement is supported by 1997 state social services  
regulations aimed at moving the homeless to work and ultimately 
self-sufficiency. The rule was legally challenged by advocates for 
the homeless and was not immediately applied in the city. 
</P>
<P>
	The advocates objected that the new rule threatened to send  
hundreds of homeless children and adults onto the streets. Last 
February, an appellate court ruled against the objections.

<HEADLINE> Philly Mayoral Candidates Clash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The man trying to become Philadelphia's  
first Republican mayor in nearly 50 years was portrayed by his 
opponent on Tuesday as someone who couldn't act independently 
because of his ties to the state's GOP governor. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrat John F. Street attacked Sam Katz's Republican  
connections in a mayoral debate, arguing that his opponent would be 
``compromised'' when lobbying for school funding in Harrisburg 
because of support he has received from GOP leaders like Gov. Tom 
Ridge. 
</P>
<P>
	``Have you seen the contributions?'' Street asked the audience  
at St. Joseph's University, before turning to Katz. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it's possible for you (to lobby) given your ties  
to the Republican administration, and the support they have given 
you, raising hundreds of thousands of dollars for this campaign,'' 
Street said. ``I think you will go into this process compromised 
from the very beginning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Katz responded that as mayor he would put Philadelphia's  
interests first. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think political leaders have to work with their opponents  
and get things done,'' he said. ``We have to work with leaders on a 
bipartisan basis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Street's attack came as Democratic national leaders mobilize to  
stump for him in the final week before the Nov. 2 election. Street 
and Katz are running neck and neck in the polls, raising the 
prospect that Philadelphia could have its first GOP mayor in 
Philadelphia since 1952. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Tipper Gore, wife of Vice President Al Gore, visited  
Philadelphia to campaign for Street, and President Clinton plans to 
do the same Friday at La Salle University.

</P>
<P>
	Under Nevada law, which was changed in the wake of Tyson's  
biting of Holyfield, a boxer can be fined his entire purse for an 
infraction. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson is not expected to attend Friday's commission meeting,  
which was called in the wake of the ending that caused fans to boo 
both fighters. 
</P>
<P>
	He said after the fight that he did not hear the bell, even  
though it rang five times as Steele moved in to try and separate 
the fighters in the middle of the ring. 
</P>
<P>
	Ratner said Monday there was no dispute that Tyson hit Norris  
after the bell, but he noted that hitting after the bell is 
relatively common in fights. Felix Trinidad did the same thing to 
Oscar De La Hoya twice in the middle rounds of their welterweight 
title fight last month, and was not penalized. 
</P>
<P>
	Steele took two points from Tyson after Norris went back to his  
corner. But the fight did not resume after Norris said he could not 
continue because of an injured knee. 
</P>
<P>
	An MRI showed his knee was dislocated, and doctors said Norris  
may need surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Norris said he did not think Tyson hit him deliberately after  
the bell. He said it was loud in the ring and hard to hear the 
bell.

<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Guard Ken Blackman, sidelined all season  
because of a knee problem, was waived Tuesday by the Cincinnati 
Bengals. 
</P>
<P>
	Blackman was placed on the physically unable to perform list in  
August as he continued his attempts to come back from two knee 
operations.

<HEADLINE> America's Cup Racing Resumes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) -- America True and Nippon called for  
delays because of gear failures, Young America turned up late, and 
the Swiss and French teams didn't show up at all. 
</P>
<P>
	The challenger series for the America's Cup fell into disarray  
Wednesday as on-board problems, blustery weather and umpires' 
exemptions left only two boats out of 11 in a real race. 
</P>
<P>
	That race turned out to be a cliffhanger, as San Francisco's  
America True made up one minute in the last leg of its race against 
Nippon, but lost by one second. 
</P>
<P>
	Even that race was delayed at the start after gear failures on  
both boats. 
</P>
<P>
	After a three-day postponement because of collision and mishap  
damage to two boats, racing resumed on Auckland's Hauraki Gulf in 
the regatta to decide who will take on defending Team New Zealand 
for sailing's most prized trophy next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials delayed the start by an hour because winds were around  
20 knots on the two courses -- more than is allowed for a start 
under race rules. 
</P>
<P>
	In the other morning races, Dennis Conner's Stars and Stripes  
got an easy start in three-foot choppy seas after rival Young 
America had a gear failure and had to return to port to make 
repairs. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials postponed the start, but not enough for Young America,  
which crossed the line just as Conner's team rounded the first mark 
to be a full leg in front. Young America began racing, but pulled 
out part-way through. 
</P>
<P>
	In their races, Italy's Prada and the Spanish team had no  
competition at all after the teams they were supposed to race -- the 
French and the Swiss, respectively -- effectively forfeited by 
staying in port to work on their boats. 
</P>
<P>
	The two scheduled races for AmericaOne were postponed until  
Thursday while the team repairs damage from a collision with Stars 
and Stripes on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The afternoon pairings had Prada vs. Abracadabra; the Spanish  
challenge vs. America True; and Stars and Stripes vs. Young 
Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	Nippon was due to face the withdrawn Swiss team, and will earn a  
point if it completes the course. 
</P>
<P>
	In more than 700 races over four months, the 11 challenger teams  
from seven countries score one point for each victory in the first 
of three round-robins, four points in the second and nine in the 
third. 
</P>
<P>
	The winner of a finals series will meet Team New Zealand in a  
best-of-9 regatta starting in February 2000 for the America's Cup.

<HEADLINE> NYC Wants Homeless People to Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Homeless people looking for a place to sleep in  
New York City shelters will have to work for it under a new policy 
beginning this winter -- a move condemned Tuesday as ``a throwback 
to the days of Dickens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New York is believed to be the only major U.S. city to impose a  
work-for-shelter requirement. 
</P>
<P>
	The city already requires welfare recipients to work to get  
their benefits. On Tuesday, Republican Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said 
city will extend the policy in about 60 days to the 4,600 families 
and 7,000 single adults staying in city-run shelters. 
</P>
<P>
	New York operates the largest, most comprehensive shelter system  
in the nation for a homeless population it estimates at 23,000. In 
other parts of the country, shelters are often run and financed by 
private charities -- some of which require people to seek work. 
</P>
<P>
	The mayor's plan stunned advocates for the homeless.  
</P>
<P>
	``This could literally put hundreds, if not thousands of people  
on the streets,'' said Patrick Markee, a policy adviser for New 
York City's Coalition for the Homeless. 
</P>
<P>
	City Council Speaker Peter Vallone, a Democrat, said Giuliani's  
move was ``a throwback to the days of Dickens. We cannot tolerate 
this morally or legally.'' Vallone acknowledged, however, that the 
City Council has little power to stop the policy. 
</P>
<P>
	The city's new requirements are supported by 1997 state  
regulations aimed at moving the homeless to work and ultimately to 
self-sufficiency. Last February, an appeals court ruled against the 
objections of advocates. 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani, who laughed when told that Vallone compared his policy  
to something out of Charles Dickens' novels, defended his plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``The apostles of dependency want to bring us back to where we  
had 1.1 million people on welfare and a city where dependency was 
the rule, working the exception,'' he said. ``I think this is the 
highest form of compassion and love -- to help people to help 
themselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani has made welfare reform a centerpiece of his  
administration. The work-for-a-bed rule is similar to requirements 
city welfare offices have used since 1995 to move more than 400,000 
people off public assistance. 
</P>
<P>
	Already, many homeless parents clean parks or do other jobs in  
exchange for welfare benefits while their children are in shelter 
day care centers. 
</P>
<P>
	Nica Person, a 26-year-old mother of three who has lived in the  
city shelter system for about a year, said city officials are 
making an unreasonable demand. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are parents who have four kids. They can't get day care  
to work. Who's going to pay for the day care?'' she asked. 
</P>
<P>
	She also said the jobs the city sends people to are often  
menial, not the type of jobs that could provide a decent living. 
</P>
<P>
	``That just puts me right back to welfare,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Greg Bowens, a spokesman for Detroit Mayor Dennis Archer, who is  
a Democrat, called Giuliani's move ``typical Republican simpleton 
logic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Would Joseph and Mary get a spot in New York today? Amazing,''  
he said.

<HEADLINE> Rolling Stone Sues Over Pitt Photos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Rolling Stone is suing a news syndication  
agency for disseminating photos of Brad Pitt in a dress from the 
magazine's October edition. 
</P>
<P>
	The magazine filed suit last week in U.S. District Court  
accusing the agency of infringing on the copyright of photographer 
Mark Seliger and the magazine's publisher. 
</P>
<P>
	The magazine gave the agency limited permission to ``use the  
images of Brad Pitt accompanying the feature article ... so long as 
they are used within the context of the magazine,'' according to 
the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've cropped out all of the references to Rolling Stone and  
the photographer,'' Kelli L. Sager, Rolling Stone's attorney, said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Parker, co-director of Headline News LA and a defendant in  
the lawsuit, denied that his organization misrepresented itself and 
said the company has told its sub-agents to stop selling the 
material. 
</P>
<P>
	Pitt, who posed for the humorous shots in dresses to accompany a  
profile entitled ``The Unbearable Bradness of Being,'' is not named 
as a plaintiff.

<HEADLINE> Kayf Tara Out of Melbourne Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) -- Kayf Tara, the favorite for the $2  
million Melbourne Cup next Tuesday, was pulled from the race 
Wednesday because of a leg injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Simon Crisford, racing manager for the Godolphin stable which  
owns the horse, said from London that a veterinary examination had 
revealed a suspensory ligament injury. The injury may not mean the 
end of Kayf Tara's career, but is severe enough to stop him racing 
in the immediate future. 
</P>
<P>
	Crisford said the injury was a severe blow to Kayf Tara's  
principal owner, Sheik Mohamad bin Rashid al-Maktoum, crown prince 
of Dubai, United Arab Emirates and one of the world's leading 
thoroughbred owners. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a bitter pill to swallow, but we'll be back,'' Crisford  
said.

<HEADLINE> Falcons' Coach Grieves Fraley </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- An emotional Dan Reeves began making plans  
Tuesday to attend the funeral of his close friend and agent. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Fraley, 46, was one of six people, including two-time  
U.S. Open champion Payne Stewart, killed in a plane crash Monday 
near Mina, S.D. 
</P>
<P>
	For Reeves, the loss is far more personal than professional. The  
Atlanta Falcons coach learned of the tragedy when his wife called 
him Monday afternoon in a Pittsburgh hotel as he preparing for a 
game his team would lose 13-9 to the Steelers. 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves plans to attend a memorial service for Fraley on Thursday  
in Orlando, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never knew anybody who, from day one, could go through life  
and be that straightforward and honest,'' Reeves said, choking back 
tears. ``I just talked to him Saturday. He was coming to our 
Jacksonville game (Nov. 7), he and Dixie. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just a shock.''  
</P>
<P>
	After departing Orlando, the private jet was destined for  
Dallas. Instead, it is believed the plane lost cabin pressure 
somewhere over north Florida, went on automatic pilot and crashed 
in South Dakota when it ran out of fuel. 
</P>
<P>
	Fraley and his partner, Van Ardan, 45, were agents for Stewart.  
Reeves had been Fraley's client since 1983, when Reeves was in his 
third season as coach of the Denver Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
	Originally brought together by former Washington Redskins coach  
Joe Gibbs, Reeves and Fraley quickly became friends. 
</P>
<P>
	``(Gibbs) told me, `I highly recommend this guy. He's a great  
guy, he's a great Christian,''' Reeves said. ``He was that way from 
day one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Reeves was marveling at the prowess Fraley showed  
while negotiating a five-year, $9-million contract with the Falcons 
in January 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves said his son Lee worked one year in Fraley's Orlando  
office and ``became part of their family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``When I walked in my office today, I looked at my Rolodex, and  
his card was the first one -- just looking right at me,'' Reeves 
said. ``It's hard to believe.''

<HEADLINE> U.S., Brazil Sign Antitrust Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States and Brazil signed an  
agreement Tuesday to increase their cooperation in investigating 
corporate mergers and price-fixing that affect both countries. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the seventh antitrust cooperation agreement the United  
States has signed with a foreign government and the first with a 
South American nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Signing the agreement in her Justice Department conference room,  
Attorney General Janet Reno said it ``is an important tool that 
will be used to protect consumers in both countries.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil has the world's eighth-largest economy, with a gross  
domestic product of more than $750 billion in 1998, and is the 
United States' third-largest export market in the Western 
Hemisphere after Canada and Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	For Brazil, the agreement was signed by Justice Minister Jose  
Carlos Dias. ``The globalization of economies has fostered mergers 
and acquisitions and joint ventures and growth in this area,'' he 
said. ``So this cooperation and exchange of information between the 
entities responsible for antitrust enforcement is not only 
beneficial but also essential.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement will become effective upon approval by the  
Brazilian National Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Pitofsky, chairman of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission,  
also signed. 
</P>
<P>
	Modeled on pacts the United States reached in 1991 with the  
European Union and in 1995 with Canada, the agreement provides that 
each country will notify the other of enforcement actions that 
might affect it and that each will consider requests to act against 
domestic behavior that harms the other country. A slightly more 
extensive agreement was signed with Japan earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
	While the agreement with Brazil calls for the exchange of  
nonconfidential information, it does not permit the sharing of 
confidential law enforcement information that was authorized by the 
more extensive assistance agreement the United States signed with 
Australia earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States also has antitrust cooperation agreements with  
Germany and Israel. Assistant Attorney General Joel I. Klein, head 
of Justice's Antitrust Division, predicted additional agreements 
would be signed with other South American countries within the next 
year.

<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Thanks in part to the World Golf Championship  
money, the cutoff to keep a PGA Tour card is not No. 125 but No. 
131 on the money list. 
</P>
<P>
	The tour decided two weeks ago to return to what's known as a  
``soft 125,'' meaning the cutoff drops according to the number of 
foreign players who happen to be higher than No. 125 on the money 
list. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, that number is six -- Jose Maria Olazabal (44), Sergio  
Garcia (52), Paul Lawrie (69), Lee Westwood (104), Colin 
Montgomerie (109) and Jean Van de Velde (116). 
</P>
<P>
	Oddly enough, none of the above is ranked this high because of  
the two $5 million WGC events thus far. Olazabal, Lawrie and Van de 
Velde got their cash from the majors, while Garcia did his damage 
in the Nelson Classic and PGA Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever the case, the ``soft 125'' will remain in effect for  
2000, along with these modifications. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Only PGA Tour members at the beginning of the year, or those  
who choose to sign up during the year (by winning) will be included 
on the official money list. A separate section of the money list 
will show official money earned by nonmembers. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Foreign players who make enough from the majors and WGC events  
to get into the top 125 will be allowed to join the PGA Tour the 
following year. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, Emelyn Aubrey is No. 131, and will keep his  
card if no one passes him after the Southern Farm Bureau Classic 
this week in Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tour Championship used to be the final tournament that  
decided the money winner. Now that Tiger Woods has nearly a $1.2 
million lead on David Duval -- and the WGC event in Spain next 
counts as official money, anyway -- the only money race in the final 
week of the PGA Tour season is at the bottom. 
</P>
<P>
                              *------	 
</P>
<P>
	TIGER'S LIST: Remember that famed list that Tiger Woods kept  
taped to his wall, which documented all that Jack Nicklaus 
accomplished? 
</P>
<P>
	A couple of clarifications are in order.  
</P>
<P>
	For one thing, Woods doesn't know if the list is still around.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think when we remodeled the house, it was taken down,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, he only charted Nicklaus through his amateur career, from  
junior golf through his NCAA title at Ohio State and his two U.S. 
Amateur victories. 
</P>
<P>
	``First time he shot below 70, when he started playing the game,  
when he won his first amateur tournament, his first junior 
tournament, his first tour event, and it showed the age,'' Woods 
said. ``That's as far as it went.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not the U.S. Open as a 22-year-old rookie? Not the 18  
professional majors? 
</P>
<P>
	``I found that out later,'' Woods said with a smile. ``And then  
the list became really long.'' 
</P>
<P>
                              *------	 
</P>
<P>
	STRANGE TV: First Ken Venturi for the Presidents Cup, now Curtis  
Strange for the Ryder Cup. Job requirements for becoming a cup 
captain must include work as a television analyst. 
</P>
<P>
	The difference is that Strange is relatively new to the  
broadcast booth and is still competing on the PGA Tour. It stands 
to reason that as Ryder Cup captain, he might be less inclined to 
criticize a player who could wind up on his team. 
</P>
<P>
	Only Strange doesn't see it that way.  
</P>
<P>
	``My job is not to be critical. My job is to analyze,'' he said.  
``If you hit a bad shot, the world sees that you've hit a bad shot. 
My role is to explain why that might have happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strange found nothing wrong with his analysis of Jean Van de  
Velde on the 72nd hole of the British Open. 
</P>
<P>
	``All I said about Van de Velde was he was making stupid  
decisions. I didn't call him stupid,'' Strange said. ``Smart people 
make stupid decisions. We've all gone through that -- well, not 
quite what he's been through.'' 
</P>
<P>
                              *------

<P>
	LPGA CLASS: Kellee Booth passed up more than $30,000 this summer  
to retain her amateur status. She didn't take long to start making 
up for that. 
</P>
<P>
	Booth, who won five amateur titles this year, blitzed the field  
in the Q-school finals last week to earn her LPGA Tour card in her 
first event. She finished four rounds on the LPGA Champions Course 
at 8-under 280, seven strokes ahead of Jean Zedlitz, and won 
$6,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``As hard as I've seen people I know work to get their cards, to  
get through on the first try is such an accomplishment,'' said 
Booth, 23, was among 19 players to earn their cards. 
</P>
<P>
	Other rookies in the class of 2000 are U.S. Amateur champion  
Dorothy Delasin, 1998 NCAA champion Jennifer Rosales and Gloria 
Park, who won the 1996 Australian Ladies Amateur title as a 
16-year-old.

	SENIOR SILLY SEASON: Jack Nicklaus and Tom Watson, one of the  
most formidable Ryder Cup partners ever, will join forces again 
Dec. 11-12 as one of four teams in the Diners Club Matches at 
Pelican Hill Golf Club in California. 
</P>
<P>
	The Diners Club Matches, created in 1994, are coming off a  
one-year break because of the Presidents Cup, but will be on the 
silly-season schedule through 2002. It features four teams each 
from the PGA Tour, LPGA Tour and Senior Tour. The purse is $1.2 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Along with Nicklaus and Watson, the other Senior Tour teams are  
Bruce Fleisher-David Graham, Allen Doyle-Dana Quigley and Gil 
Morgan-Jay Sigel. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Senior Tour will offer an awesome threesome for  
the Wendy's Three-Tour Challenge -- Nicklaus, Watson and Hale 
Irwin. 
</P>
<P>
                              *------	 
</P>
<P>
	DIVOTS: Now that the Solheim Cup has changed sites, it might be  
changing dates. The women's version of the Ryder Cup, set for next 
year at the Loch Lomond Golf Club in Scotland, could be moved from 
October in order to get live coverage from BBC television. As it 
is, the BBC will televise the World Match Play Championship, 
scheduled for the same week. One date under consideration is the 
last week in August. ... Tiger Woods will carry a Titleist bag 
through the end of the year, which means he could have one logo for 
the first two rounds of his end-of-the-year tournament and another 
logo for the final two rounds. ... The LPGA Corning Classic is 
raising its purse by $50,000 to $800,000, the 15th time in 21 years 
the tournament has upped the ante. ... The four wild-card 
selections for the Senior Match Play Championship in Puerto Rico 
are Raymond Floyd, David Graham, Al Geiberger and Jack Nicklaus. 
</P>
<P>
                              *------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *STAT OF THE WEEK: Only 30 players are eligible for the  
winners-only Mercedes Championship in Hawaii, which could wind up 
with a smaller field than the Tour Championship because some 
foreign golfers don't play that early in the year. 
</P>
<P>
                              *------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *FINAL WORD: ``I set some goals this year. I always set them  
very high at the start of the year, and this is the first year that 
I've achieved all the goals that I've set.'' -- Payne Stewart, on 
the eve of last week's Disney Classic.

<HEADLINE> Air Force Spent $308K on Kitchen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The kitchen was too hot and dimly lit, and the  
refrigerator didn't work. But instead of improving the ventilation, 
replacing the lights and buying a new refrigerator, the Air Force 
budgeted $151,000 to overhaul the room -- and had spent twice that 
much by the time it was done. 
</P>
<P>
	In a detailed report released Monday, the Air Force Audit Agency  
faulted the Air Force for the kitchen project and other work done 
on, or planned for, the Carlton House, home of the Air Force 
Academy's superintendent, and the Otis House, the commandant of 
cadets' residence. 
</P>
<P>
	The auditors also criticized the Air Force for financing the  
work with money from its operations budget rather than using its 
housing repair budget. Some members of Congress accused the Air 
Force of not using the housing-repair budget in order to avoid 
congressional review of the projects. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement issued Monday, the Air Force said all future  
renovations to Air Force Academy officers' residences will be paid 
for from the housing repair budget. That means all such work 
costing more than $25,000 will require Air Force headquarters 
approval and a report to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	``Renovations and modifications to the Carlton House did not  
always appear warranted,'' the audit said, citing as an example 
$308,000 in renovation work done last year on its restaurant-style 
kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
	``The 1998 remodeling effort was questionable when compared to  
the documented justification,'' the auditors wrote. ``Specifically, 
the work request stated: `The area is always hot, the lighting is 
poor, the refrigerator is not functional for a family.' However, 
rather than improving the ventilation and lighting and replacing 
the refrigerator, the academy performed a complete kitchen 
renovation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Work on the 1,300-square-foot kitchen originally was budgeted  
for $151,000 but grew to $308,000. ``Some of the cost growth 
appeared avoidable,'' the audit said. 
</P>
<P>
	The review also found fault with the Air Force's plans for  
$125,000 in work on the Otis House, including a $40,000 project to 
move a bathroom wall to widen an adjoining bedroom by one foot. The 
planned work there also included a $14,000 conversion of the 
outdoor barbecue from charcoal to gas. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Force previously defended the renovations as necessary  
to maintain historic homes that are also used heavily for public 
functions. The audit was requested by Air Force Secretary F. 
Whitten Peters.

<HEADLINE> N.Y. Giants Sign Brandon Sanders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- The New York Giants signed safety  
Brandon Sanders to the team's active roster and placed running back 
Gary Brown on injured reserve Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Giants also signed Tre Thomas to the practice squad and  
waived James Kidd. 
</P>
<P>
	The 5-foot-8-inch, 185-pound Sanders spent the 1997 and 1998  
seasons with the Giants before being drafted by the Cleveland 
Browns in the 1999 expansion draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders was released by the Browns after training camp and was  
re-signed by the Giants before being waived for an additional 
cornerback. In two years with the Giants, Sanders recorded four 
solo tackles and 19 special teams tackles. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown, a 1000-yard rusher in 1998, played in three games this  
season, rushing for 177 yards. He underwent arthroscopic surgery 
last week to repair extensive cartilage damage in his knee and will 
be on crutches for six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	To make room for Thomas on the practice squad, the Giants waived  
Kidd, who was signed as a rookie free agent out of Colorado before 
training camp in July. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas spent training camp with the Giants and finished the  
preseason with nine tackles, six solo. 
</P>
<P>
	He originally was signed as a rookie free agent by Detroit in  
1997, then was waived five months later. He was signed by 
Jacksonville on Dec. 24, 1997, then waived on Aug. 26, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas, who played at Texas, signed as a free agent with the  
Berlin Thunder of NFL Europe in May and started six games at both 
safety positions, finishing the season with 23 total tackles, four 
passes defensed and three special teams tackles.

<HEADLINE> Mo. Gov. Accuses Rival of Smear </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Democratic Gov. Mel Carnahan said his  
political rival is trying to destroy his reputation by circulating 
a 1960 photograph of him wearing blackface for a minstrel show. 
</P>
<P>
	The two-term governor is challenging Republican Sen. John  
Ashcroft for his Senate seat in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``John Ashcroft has reached back almost four decades to try to  
find something that would imply that I might harbor racist attitude 
or would knowingly polarize our state,'' Carnahan said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Using a 39-year-old photograph to tear down my reputation will  
not salvage his own.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ashcroft spokesman Steve Hilton had no comment about Carnahan's  
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like I've grown,'' the 65-year-old Carnahan added. ``I  
certainly regret my participation in this kind of theater, and I 
sincerely and readily apologize for my insensitivity of 39 years 
ago.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carnahan, who was elected governor in 1992 with substantial  
black support, said Monday that he had called black leaders to 
apologize. He would not identify them. 
</P>
<P>
	Carnahan said he has built a progressive record on racial  
issues. He cited his legislative sponsorship of a state civil 
rights law in 1965 and the appointment of the first black Missouri 
Supreme Court judge in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	That judge, Ronnie White, was rejected for a federal judgeship  
on Oct. 5 after Ashcroft told the Senate that White was soft on the 
death penalty and ``pro-criminal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carnahan accused Ashcroft, stung by allegations of racism for  
his role in defeating White's nomination, of responsibility for 
circulating the photo. 
</P>
<P>
	``Senator Ashcroft is counting on Missourians to be unable to  
see any difference between the insensitivity captured in this 
photograph four decades ago and the polarizing acts he committed on 
the Senate floor just days ago,'' Carnahan said. 
</P>
<P>
	The executive director of the Missouri GOP, John Hancock, said  
research turned up the photo in the Rolla Daily News, the 
governor's hometown paper. 
</P>
<P>
	Hancock denied having any hand in distributing the photo. A  
glossy print of the photograph and a copy of the clipping dated 
Oct. 12, 1960, were provided to The Associated Press on Sunday by a 
Republican source on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The photo shows Carnahan, then 26; his older brother, Bob; and  
two other men performing as a barbershop quartet at a Kiwanis Club 
fund-raiser. The men wore tuxedos and blackface makeup with 
exaggerated white circles around their eyes and mouths. 
</P>
<P>
	Carnahan said he was ``uncomfortable'' about wearing blackface  
at the time, but was the newest member of the group and didn't 
challenge the costume.

<HEADLINE> Louganis To Star in Musical Comedy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOLLYWOOD, Fla. (AP) -- Greg Louganis has picked up a new habit.  
</P>
<P>
	The Olympic gold medal-winning diver is starring in the musical  
comedy, ``Nunsense A-Men,'' which opens Friday and runs through 
Dec. 5 at the Hollywood Playhouse. 
</P>
<P>
	Louganis, who won four gold medals in two Olympics and later  
disclosed he was HIV-positive, will pull on a habit six times a 
week for his role as Sister Robert Ann, a streetwise nun who always 
wanted to be a star. All the nuns in this production are men. 
</P>
<P>
	The former diver, author and motivational speaker says he likes  
working in an ensemble cast. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's always someone there to hold your hand,'' said  
Louganis, 39. ``It feels more supportive, I guess.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Louganis said he doesn't consider himself a role model.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're all human. We all make mistakes,'' he said Tuesday.  
``Role model, in my mind, is perfection and one can't be that. I 
try to encourage young people to be their own heroes and their own 
role models.''

	NTSB Begins Stewart Crash Inquiry  
</P>
<P>
	MINA, S.D. (AP) -- Investigators began gathering the remains of  
golfer Payne Stewart and five others today, hoping to determine 
whether a sudden loss in cabin pressure doomed their Learjet. 
Experts at the crash site were sending tissue samples from the 
victims to a medical examiner's lab to test for such substances as 
carbon monoxide. But Brad Randall, a state medical examiner, said 
toxicology tests may be worthless in attempting to verify that the 
victims suffered oxygen deprivation yesterday because of a sudden 
decompression of the aircraft.

	Russia Barrages Outskirts of Grozny  
</P>
<P>
	GROZNY, Russia (AP) -- Exploding artillery shells rattled windows  
and spread fear in the Chechen capital Tuesday, as the heaviest 
fighting in weeks brought Russian tanks and soldiers near the city 
limits. U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright called the 
situation ominous and expressed concern about civilian casualties. 
Russian officials have given mixed signals about whether they plan 
to storm Grozny in their campaign to wipe out Islamic militants 
based in Chechnya.

	N.H. Poll: Bradley Leads Gore  
</P>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- Presidential hopeful Bill Bradley leads  
fellow Democrat Al Gore in New Hampshire and fares better in a 
hypothetical matchup with GOP front-runner George W. Bush than the 
vice president would in the state, says a poll released today. 
Among the 455 Democratic voters surveyed, Bradley had an apparent 
lead of 47 percent to Gore's 39 percent in the Quinnipiac College 
Poll. Among the 459 Republican voters surveyed, 41 percent favored 
Bush to 28 percent for Arizona Sen. John McCain. Ten percent were 
for Steve Forbes.

	Some States Lag in Computer Access  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An annual report on school technology released  
today said that while the number of school computers has doubled 
since 1993 to 8 million nationwide, many states lag in access they 
provide students. Furthermore, the report said, if classroom 
computers are going to make a difference, the nation must focus on 
training teachers to do more with them than surfing Web sites and 
sending e-mail. Pupils have computer access above the national 
average in Midwestern states such as Iowa, Ohio and Minnesota, with 
relatively little computer-related industry. But California, home 
of Silicon Valley, provides the fewest computer terminals for its 
students.

	NYC Wants Homeless People To Work  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Homeless people looking for a place to sleep in  
New York City shelters will have to work for it under a policy 
beginning this winter -- a move condemned today by opponents as ``a 
throwback to the days of Dickens.'' New York is believed to be the 
only major U.S. city to impose a work-for-shelter requirement. The 
city already requires welfare recipients to work to get their 
benefits. The mayor's plan stunned advocates for the homeless. 
``This could literally put hundreds, if not thousands of people on 
the streets,'' said Patrick Markee, a policy adviser for New York 
City's Coalition for the Homeless.

	U.S. Army To Probe Korean War Allegations

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Army is sending an investigative team to  
South Korea to begin the field inquiry into allegations of a Korean 
War massacre of civilians by U.S. soldiers. Kenneth Bacon, 
spokesman for Defense Secretary William Cohen, said the meeting 
will mark the start of the information sharing that Cohen promised 
President Kim Dae-jung in an Oct. 8 letter. On Sept. 30, The 
Associated Press reported accounts by American veterans and South 
Korean villagers that U.S. soldiers killed up to 400 civilians 
under a bridge at No Gun Ri, South Korea, early in the war.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks closed mixed today as investors failed to

close of trading on Wall Street, the Dow was down 47.80 at 
10,302.13, having surrendered an earlier 59-point gain. On the 
NYSE, decliners led advancers 1,883-1,183. The Nasdaq rose 2.73 to

<HEADLINE> Somber Mood at Southern Farm Bureau  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MADISON, Miss. (AP) -- PGA Tour players at the Southern Farm  
Bureau Classic went through with their practice routine Tuesday, 
minus the fun-loving spirit that usually goes along with it. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite a nearly picture-perfect day for golf, a somber mood  
hung over Annadale Golf Club in the wake of U.S. Open champion 
Payne Stewart's death in a plane crash a day earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are all like a traveling gypsy clan out here,'' Blaine  
McAllister said. ``In our lockerroom there's usually a jovial talk 
and all that. It's not like that right now. It's a very somber 
moment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Making the turn during a practice round he played alone, Kevin  
Sutherland said the tragedy had put things in perspective for many 
of the tour players. 
</P>
<P>
	``What it does is make you know what is really important,''  
Sutherland said. ``Golf just really isn't all that important. It's 
what we do, but it's just not that important. It's going to be a 
strain, it's going to be a tough week to play golf.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like the Tour Championship in Houston, the Southern Farm Bureau  
Classic will suspend play Friday, the day a memorial service is 
scheduled for Stewart in Orlando, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	The PGA Tour is arranging a charter flight for players who want  
to fly from Mississippi to attend the service. Southern Farm Bureau 
officials also planned a memorial Thursday night at a church in 
Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Tour Championship is planning two 27-hole rounds to  
make up for the suspension of play Friday, the Southern Farm Bureau 
will be shortened to 54 holes. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Tour Championship, they have a little flexibility we don't  
have and that's numbers,'' PGA Tour official Arvin Ginn said. 
``Daylight doesn't provide us any flexibility. 
</P>
<P>
	``Friday is a lost day. We are losing a day in honor of Payne  
Stewart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A 132-player field will play at the Southern Farm Bureau  
Classic, as opposed to 29 top players at the Tour Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Tournament officials had originally planned to extend the  
tournament to Monday, but decided later against that because of 
many factors. 
</P>
<P>
	Several players at the Southern Farm Bureau could be involved in  
events next week. The second stage of PGA Tour Qualifying begins 
Tuesday at four different sites and the World Golf Championships 
are next week in Spain. 
</P>
<P>
	A pro-am scheduled Wednesday and Thursday's first round at  
Annandale will be played as planned. The second round and the cut 
will be made Saturday, and the final round will be played Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Stankowski agreed with the suspension of play Friday, and  
like most of the players, agreed with the decision to shorten 
rather than extend the Southern Farm Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Friday issue is great, just out of respect for Payne,''  
said Stankowski, who plans to attend the memorial service in 
Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
	Eric Booker, who played collegiately at Mississippi State,  
agreed it was an awkward situation. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a lot of people that the tour wants to please, and  
it can't please everybody,'' Booker said. ``I'll just go with the 
flow and play with whatever decision they have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Booker is in a situation where he has to play. He is currently  
125th on the money list and trying to maintain at least that 
position to keep his PGA Tour card for next season. 
</P>
<P>
	Several players who had committed to play never made it to  
Annandale, and had officially withdrawn from the tournament by 
Tuesday. Among them were Scott Hoch and Rocco Mediate, friends of 
Stewart and two of the highest ranked players in the field.

<HEADLINE> Vendors Key to Late Nasdaq Quotes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Many of the most popular financial Web sites  
will be unable to provide after-hours stock quotes until the 
vendors that provide the quotes are equipped to distribute the late 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq extended the hours of its price quote ticker to 6:30  
p.m. Eastern time on Monday with the intention of helping 
individual investors get the latest prices for stocks trading 
during after-hours sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	But a number of financial Web sites, including Bloomberg.com,  
Morningstar.com and Marketwatch.com, were unable to display the 
quotes. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for Marketwatch.com confirmed Tuesday that the  
after-hours information wasn't available because Marketwatch's 
vendors were unable to upgrade their technology to meet a Nasdaq 
requirement that after-hours quotes be identified as late trades. 
</P>
<P>
	Cable network CNBC, which runs the Nasdaq's ticker on the bottom  
of its screen, was one of the few places where the after-hours 
prices were accessible to a wide audience during the first two days 
of the extended ticker hours. 
</P>
<P>
	CNBC is shading the after-hours quotes in gold so that viewers  
know they are different from trades that took place during the 
regular trading session. The quotes are shaded green and red during 
normal trading hours. 
</P>
<P>
	The quotes are also available at the Nasdaq's Web site at  
www.nasdaq.com. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, investors with access to sophisticated trading  
software that includes so-called Nasdaq Level II quotes -- data 
primarily used by professional traders -- can also view the quotes. 
</P>
<P>
	An official at a financial data vending company that hasn't yet  
met the Nasdaq requirements said very few of the large vendors were 
prepared to segregate the late quotes and distribute them 
differently than data collected during regular trading hours. 
</P>
<P>
	``The after-hours data has to be identified as information that  
took place during the extended session,'' said the official on 
condition of anonymity, ``and that's not something the vendors can 
throw up overnight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nasdaq decided to keep its ticker open later in response to  
growing pressure from alternative trading exchanges known as 
electronic communications networks, or ECNs. 
</P>
<P>
	While some ECNs offer trading beyond 5:15 p.m., there has been  
no single place for investors to keep track of all these trades. 
That has raised worries that investors may not be able to find the 
best price for a given stock.

<HEADLINE> Robert E. Rubin Joins Citigroup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Former U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin  
has returned to Wall Street, taking a job in the crowded chairman's 
suite at Citigroup Inc., the nation's largest financial company. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin will serve as chairman of the executive committee of the  
board, and will work in a new three-man office of the chairman with 
two powerful personalities: Sanford I. Weill and John S. Reed, the 
men who created Citigroup and share the titles of chairman and 
chief executive officers. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday's appointment was a coup for Citigroup, which was just  
one many financial firms vying for Rubin's talents since he left 
the Clinton administration in July. 
</P>
<P>
	``John Reed and Sandy Weill definitely reeled in a big fish,''  
said Michael Ancell, an analyst with Edward Jones. Rubin ``can 
definitely open a lot of doors for Citigroup's investment bankers 
and corporate bankers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin, 61, will advise Citigroup on strategy and managerial  
issues, but will not have any day-to-day responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
	``He will help us think through our strategy -- What we should be  
executing, How we continue to develop the culture of this 
company,'' said Weill. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin's name had been floated on Wall Street as a possible  
successor for the top job at Citigroup. But he dismissed the rumors 
Tuesday, saying, ``I did not want to be and will not be a CEO.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Rubin's experience in Washington, coupled with his prior  
career as an investment banker at Goldman Sachs, should make him a 
key player at Citigroup. The New York-based financial company is 
expanding overseas while facing new competition at home. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bob has a set of experiences that map perfectly with the  
objectives of Citigroup,'' Reed said. 
</P>
<P>
	The financial industry is expected to change dramatically in the  
coming years as Congress nears an overhaul of Depression-era laws 
and allows mergers between banks, insurance companies and brokerage 
firms. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger between Citibank and Travelers Group last year was  
the first to test those laws. So far, the combined company has 
shown promise. 
</P>
<P>
	Citigroup's stock is up 54 percent this year, and profits for  
the first nine months of the year rose 41 percent to $7.3 billion, 
as lending and investment services recovered from market turmoil 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	While many investors and analysts originally predicted Reed and  
Weill couldn't share power, the two have made it work. On Tuesday, 
the executives downplayed the risk of adding a third ego to the 
mix. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you respect somebody's intelligence, and I think we all  
respect each other, it's amazing how you can come to a common theme 
and understand what the other person is thinking and really move 
ahead,'' Weill said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin, who took control of the Treasury Department in 1995, was  
widely acclaimed as one of the most effective secretaries in 
history. The U.S. economy is continuing its eight-year expansion, 
and emerging markets overseas are on the mend. 
</P>
<P>
	Political leaders respected Rubin, who built a solid reputation  
and a $26 million fortune at Goldman Sachs. Rubin started as a bond 
trader at the investment banking firm in 1966 after receiving a law 
degree from Yale University. He worked his way up to co-chairman of 
Goldman Sachs. 
</P>
<P>
	Since leaving Washington, Rubin continued to speak out on public  
policy issues, particularly inner city development, and has become 
the chairman of the New York-based Local Initiative Support Corp., 
a nonprofit organization. He is also on the board of the New 
York-based Mt. Sinai Medical Center.

<HEADLINE> Gold Drops by $10 an Ounce  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Gold futures tumbled for a seventh straight session Tuesday on  
the New York Mercantile Exchange, continuing to erode gains from a 
stunning autumn rally that analysts say may have been unrealistic. 
</P>
<P>
	In other markets, soybean and wheat futures fell sharply,  
influenced by wet weather in Brazil and Argentina and dry weather 
on the southern U.S. plains. Coffee lost 5 percent of its value as 
the Brazilian showers dealt a broad impact in commodities markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Gold for December delivery settled down $10.20 at $290.30 an  
ounce. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday's decline meant the metal has given back more than half  
of the phenomenal 34 percent gain it registered over two weeks in 
late September and early October. 
</P>
<P>
	But analysts agreed the slump is likely to end soon, at well  
above the $255 level it saw before prices took off. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you see the price go vertical like it did, you expect a  
bit of a selloff,'' said Gil Atzmon, chief investment strategist 
for U.S. Global Investors Inc. in San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar's recovery against most foreign currencies has  
contributed to gold's recent decline, as has the falloff in demand 
in Asia and India after the price peaked at $339 on Oct. 5. 
</P>
<P>
	But analysts said there has been little news to change the  
price, saying the slump is technically driven as funds sell their 
positions. 
</P>
<P>
	``There isn't a lot to trade off of,'' said David Meger of  
Alaron Trading in Chicago. ``You really went from a situation where 
you had the general public saying 'Gold's a great buy' to a point 
where the whole sediment out there has really changed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dan Vaught, a futures analyst for A.G. Edwards and Sons in St.  
Louis, said the fall was inevitable because the big rally was based 
on an announcement that didn't change much fundamentally about the 
market -- the Sept. 27 statement by 15 European central banks that 
they would limit sales over the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Realistically, they said they were going to continue what  
they've done in the past,'' Vaught said. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Chicago Board of Trade, soybeans dove to their lowest  
closing price since Aug. 30, driven by a selling frenzy in the last 
15 minutes of the session. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said funds led the way, selling more than 2,000 lots in  
the final quarter-hour of trading despite a lack of dramatic news. 
A broad selloff was triggered when the price fell below Tuesday's 
low, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pressuring soybeans were forecasts for rain throughout growing  
regions of Brazil and Argentina, easing concerns that the planting 
season will be badly marred by an extended dry spell. 
</P>
<P>
	Anne Frick, oilseeds analyst for Prudential Securities, also  
cited the ``inability of this market to rally'' as prompting a 
selloff by large funds. 
</P>
<P>
	November soybeans fell 10 1/2 cents to $4.68 1/4 a bushel.  
</P>
<P>
	Wheat prices rose to a three-week high on the same Chicago  
market, supported by dryness in winter wheat growing areas in 
Canada and the U.S. Southwest. An extended forecast calls for no 
rain in wheat-growing areas of Kansas, Nebraska, Oklahoma and Texas 
next week, leaving the newly sprouted crop vulnerable to drought 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
	December wheat fell 5 1/4 cents to $2.56 3/4 a bushel.  
</P>
<P>
	Coffee reversed course, giving up most of the previous day's  
large gains on New York's Coffee, Sugar &AMP; Cocoa Exchange. Several 
forecasts called for showers through the end of the week in Brazil, 
which likely would limit damage to the 2000-01 crop being planted 
now. 
</P>
<P>
	Rain also is improving the crop prospects in Argentina.  
</P>
<P>
	December coffee fell 4.45 cents to 95.30 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Sues Over Use of His Name </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Michael Jordan asked a federal court Tuesday to  
end an agreement under which he sold two restaurateurs the use of 
his name for eateries in Chicago and surrounding counties. 
</P>
<P>
	In a federal court battle that has been waged for almost two  
years, attorneys for the former basketball star charged that 
companies run by Chicago businessmen Gene and Joe Silverberg ``have 
breached their promise to protect Mr. Jordan's name and the good 
will associated with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They have orchestrated a campaign to diminish the value of Mr.  
Jordan's name and its good will,'' they said in court papers. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan signed an agreement with the Silverbergs in September  
1990 allowing the use of his name for restaurants in the six-county 
area surrounding Chicago. They opened Michael Jordan's restaurant 
just north of downtown, and it became an instant magnet for 
tourists. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result of the legal battle, however, the Silverbergs  
recently dropped the use of Jordan's name and renamed the 
restaurant for Chicago Cubs slugger Sammy Sosa. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit was filed initially by the Silverbergs in November  
1997, seeking to block Jordan from developing a new restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
	The new restaurant, One Sixtyblue, is located west of downtown  
Chicago. It doesn't use Jordan's name, but he has ownership 
interest in it.

<HEADLINE> Sheppard Case Moving Along </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LARAMIE, Wyo. (AP) -- Jurors saw photographs of Matthew Shepard's  
bloody face as prosecutors began presenting their case against 
Aaron McKinney, accused of beating the gay student to death in a 
drunken, drug-induced rage. 
</P>
<P>
	They also saw pictures of the ponderosa pine fence where Shepard  
was left to die, his hands tied behind his back, and the pool of 
blood caused by more than a dozen blows as he fought his attackers. 
</P>
<P>
	Shepard's mother, Judy, dabbed her eyes when prosecutors showed  
jurors the graphic photos while McKinney's father, William, bowed 
his head. McKinney barely glanced up. 
</P>
<P>
	``Matthew Shepard made a frail attempt to fight back,'' said  
prosecutor Cal Rerucha during opening statements Monday. ``McKinney 
struck him as hard as he could.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorneys countered that McKinney, who faces the death  
penalty, didn't intend to kill Shepard when he and a friend 
accompanied Shepard from a Laramie bar after he asked McKinney for 
a ride home. 
</P>
<P>
	The 21-year-old University of Wyoming freshman was driven to a  
remote area, pistol-whipped and left overnight in near-freezing 
temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense portrayed McKinney as the victim of sexual abuse who  
lashed out when approached for a gay encounter. McKinney's judgment 
that night was affected by alcohol, methamphetamines and ``some 
sexually traumatic and confusing events in his life,'' defense 
attorney Jason Tangeman told jurors. 
</P>
<P>
	Tangeman said McKinney, 22, was confused by homosexual  
encounters when he was younger. In one case, McKinney was forced 
into an oral sex act with a neighborhood bully, Tangeman said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Did Matthew Shepard deserve to die? No, that's ridiculous. No  
manslaughter victim deserved to die,'' he said. ``That's what Aaron 
McKinney is guilty of -- manslaughter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McKinney has been charged with first-degree murder, kidnapping  
and robbery. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial of the other man accused of the slaying that shocked  
the nation, Russell Henderson, ended in April just before a jury 
was seated. Henderson pleaded guilty to felony murder and 
kidnapping and was sentenced to life in prison. The plea allowed 
Henderson to avoid the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, prosecutors called their first three witnesses: Aaron  
Kreifels, the college student who found Shepard; Charles Dolan, the 
neighbor who tried to help; and Albany County Deputy Reggie Fluty, 
who said she told the barely breathing victim, ``Baby, I'm so sorry 
this happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kreifels and Dolan described efforts to free Shepard from the  
fence, his hands tied to the bottom of a post. Fluty said it 
appeared Shepard had been crying. Shepard was taken to a hospital 
where he died five days later.

<HEADLINE> Teen Identifies McKinney in Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LARAMIE, Wyo. (AP) -- Aaron McKinney, accused of the fatal  
beating of gay college student Matthew Shepard, pulled out a gun 
and clubbed another man hours after Shepard was attacked, a 
teen-ager testified Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeremy Herrera, 19, said McKinney was arguing with Emiliano  
Morales III when McKinney went to his truck, pulled out a gun and 
hit Morales from behind. 
</P>
<P>
	``I heard a thud. It was the most sickening thing I ever heard  
in my life,'' said Herrera, who added he struck McKinney with a 
thick stick. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said the fight helped them connect McKinney to Shepard's  
beating. 
</P>
<P>
	McKinney is charged with murder, kidnapping and robbery. If  
convicted, he faces the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	During the first full day of testimony, jurors also heard from  
the coroner who examined Shepard's body, a bartender and Morales, 
who said the beating rendered him unable to identify his attacker. 
</P>
<P>
	McKinney's co-defendant, Russell Henderson, pleaded guilty to  
kidnapping and felony murder in April and received life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors say McKinney and Henderson kidnapped Shepard and  
took him to a remote area near Laramie on Oct. 7, 1998 and lashed 
him to a fence, where they robbed him of $20. Shepard was beaten 
into a coma. He died five days later.

	SPLURGE ON THE COFFEE, NOT THE COFFEEMAKER: You can spend $10 or  
$240 for a coffeemaker, but if you think spending more will give 
you a better cup of coffee, save your money, advises Consumer 
Reports magazine. In its November issue, the magazine rates 
coffeemakers and finds all make a good cup; convenience is what 
makes one machine better than another. You can pay for extra 
features like timers, thermal carafes and built-in grinders, but in 
the end, the magazine says, buying decent coffee is the real key to 
a good brew.

<P>
	COMMUNICATIONS BREAKDOWN: In many corporate mergers, there's a  
failure in communications between managers and their employees that 
hurts a company's performance, finds the management consulting firm 
Towers Perrin. But Towers Perrin says the problem doesn't begin 
with the merger announcement -- often the company didn't have a 
well-managed communications process before the deal was cut. The 
problem can be exacerbated by inconsistent information or long gaps 
between communications, and by the fact that management often has a 
cheerleading attitude that employees find phony. Another problem is 
that top managers often don't seek out feedback from employees, so 
they don't know that their way of communicating is hurting rather 
than helping a company's performance. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	FOOD TALKS: Many employers understand that good pay and benefits  
and a balance between work and family will keep workers happy. Some 
bosses go a step further, and provide a nurturing environment -- one 
where employees are well-fed. Inc. magazine reports on several 
companies that go beyond vending machines or corporate cafeterias, 
and bring in caterers. APB Energy Inc. in Louisville, Ky., where 
many employees have to work through lunch, provides a noontime 
meal, allowing everyone to choose from a menu. Software provider 
Analytical Graphics in Malvern, Pa., has a caterer in nightly. 
Workers will take a break, eat dinner, then return to work, often 
until 8:30 p.m. The caterer costs about $300,000 annually, but 
chief executive Paul Graziani told Inc., ``We've got a great set of 
folks who bust their tails all day long and who are often here 
late. It's just the right thing to do.''

<HEADLINE> Israel, Arab Country Form Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Mauritania, a West African Muslim country in  
the Arab League, will establish diplomatic relations with Israel in 
a move to be marked by a visit of its foreign minister to 
Washington, U.S. officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Secretary of State Madeleine Albright will meet with Foreign  
Ministers Ahmed Ould sid Ahmed of Mauritania and David Levy of 
Israel on Thursday. She will also confer with Levy on prospects for 
progress in negotiations with the Palestinians and on opening talks 
with Syria. 
</P>
<P>
	Egypt was the first Arab country to make peace with Israel in  
1979. Jordan followed in 1994, and both countries have full ties 
with the Jewish state. 
</P>
<P>
	There is already a small Israeli diplomatic presence in  
Mauritania that will be upgraded to formal ties, according to the 
U.S. officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Levy, who was born in Morocco in North Africa, will discuss with  
Albright the ongoing negotiations with the Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton will hold talks early next week in Oslo with  
Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat as 
they all attend a commemoration of the 1993 Oslo accords that set 
the two sides on a negotiating path. 
</P>
<P>
	Levy's visit was announced shortly after the Israeli government  
named David Ivri, the chairman of its National Security Council, as 
the country's next ambassador to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Ivri, a former air force commander and a major general in the  
reserves, has also served as director general of the Defense 
Ministry and special adviser to the minister. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the years he has been closely involved in Israel's  
purchases of American weapons and other aspects of security 
cooperation with Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Barak made the choice in consultation with Levy, the ministry  
said in a press release. 
</P>
<P>
	Ivri will take over from Zalman Shoval, an appointee of the  
previous government of Benjamin Netanyahu. Shoval asked to be 
relieved of the post.

<HEADLINE> Singer-Songwriter Hoyt Axton Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                         *By SUSAN GALLAGHER    	
</P>
<P>
                      *Associated Press Writer    	
</P>
<P>
	HELENA, Mont. (AP) -- Hoyt Axton, a folksy baritone, songwriter  
and actor who wrote Three Dog Night's No. 1 hit ``Joy to the 
World'' and songs that were performed by artists from Elvis Presley 
to Ringo Starr, died Tuesday. He was 61. 
</P>
<P>
	Axton died at his ranch in the Bitterroot Valley, surrounded by  
family and friends. He moved to the area after playing a sheriff in 
the movie ``Disorganized Crime,'' filmed there in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	He suffered a heart attack two weeks ago and another during  
surgery, said Jan Woods, a longtime friend in Nashville, Tenn. He 
had never fully recovered from a 1996 stroke and used a wheelchair 
much of the time. Axton also had advanced complications from 
diabetes. 
</P>
<P>
	Axton's mother, Mae Boren Axton, had her own spot in popular  
culture history as the writer of Presley's ``Heartbreak Hotel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``When Mae died three years ago, she left me Hoyt,'' Ms. Woods  
said. ``He was probably one of the most honest, humorous kids that 
never grew up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There was nobody that didn't like Hoyt,'' said Fran Boyd,  
executive director of the Los Angeles-based Academy of Country 
Music. ``Oh God, was he fun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Three Dog Night's recording of his novelty ``Joy to the World''  
(``Jeremiah was a bullfrog ...'') was on top of the charts for six 
straight weeks in 1971, making it the top hit of the year. Axton 
pitched the song to group members when he was their opening act in 
1969-70. He also wrote ``Never Been to Spain'' for the band, a song 
also recorded by Presley. 
</P>
<P>
	Axton's own singing hits include ``Boney Fingers'' (``Work your  
fingers to the bone, what do you get? Boney fingers'') and ``When 
the Morning Comes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The native of Duncan, Okla., started out singing folk songs in  
the clubs of San Francisco in 1958 and a song he co-wrote, 
``Greenback Dollar,'' was a 1963 hit for the Kingston Trio. 
</P>
<P>
	He wrote hits for Starr (``No No Song'') and Steppenwolf (``The  
Pusher''). Others who performed songs he wrote included Joan Baez, 
Waylon Jennings, John Denver and Linda Ronstadt. 
</P>
<P>
	Steppenwolf's ``The Pusher'' and ``Snowblind Friend'' were rare  
forays into a more serious theme. ``The Pusher'' was a powerful, 
passionate song that condemned drug sellers. 
</P>
<P>
	And 1975's ``No No Song'' included the lines ``No no no no, I  
don't sniff it no more. I'm tired of waking up on the floor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But in 1997, police found slightly more than a pound of  
marijuana at Axton's home. Deborah Hawkins, whom Axton wed later 
that year, said she gave him marijuana because it relieved some of 
the pain, anxiety and stress he suffered after his stroke, her 
lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Axton was given a three-year deferred sentence and fined $15,000  
for marijuana possession. Hawkins got a one-year deferred sentence 
and a $1,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
	A large man, Axton as an actor specialized in playing good ol'  
boys on TV and in films, including ``Gremlins'' and ``The Black 
Stallion.'' He sang the ``Head to the Mountains'' jingle used to 
advertise Busch beer in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors include Axton's wife and five children.

<HEADLINE> Selig Says Rose Will Not Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The fans have spoken, and Bud Selig says it  
makes no difference: Pete Rose isn't coming back to baseball, not 
as long as he's commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
	Selig was in the stands Sunday night and heard the 55-second  
ovation for the banned career hits leader, the longest ovation for 
any of the 30 members of the All-Century team. 
</P>
<P>
	``That certainly can't influence your decision,'' Selig said  
Tuesday night before Game 3 of the World Series. ``In life, you 
have to do what you think is right -- as Bart did, as other 
commissioners did. ... You can't be governed by what you think `X' 
number of people feel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Following an investigation of Rose's gambling 10 years ago, the  
Cincinnati Reds manager agreed to a lifetime ban from baseball. 
Rose applied for reinstatement in September 1997, but Selig has not 
yet made a formal ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Selig hasn't hidden his feelings on the matter, saying  
he's seen no new evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Bart Giamatti decision was very clear and very lucid on  
all points,'' Selig said. ``I've made my feelings well known over 
the past year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As long as Rose remains on the permanently banned list, he is  
ineligible for the Hall of Fame ballot. Selig said he sees no 
reason for a compromise decision in which Rose could enter the Hall 
but still remain banned from baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	``These kind of situations in life really don't call for a  
middle grounds decision,'' Selig said. 
</P>
<P>
	Selig said he didn't second-guess himself for inviting Rose to  
participate in the ceremony with the other 17 living members of the 
team, but he didn't want to get into the debate on Jim Gray's 
controversial interview with Rose on NBC after the ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're always better off when the focus of the game is on the  
field, not on us,'' Selig said. ``But no one ever said life is 
simple, and this proves that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``After viewing the videotape, I can understand the reaction of  
many baseball fans,'' Gray said before NBC's telecast of Game 3 of 
the World Series on Tuesday night. ``I thought that it was 
important to ask Pete Rose if this was the right moment for him to 
make an apology. 
</P>
<P>
	``If in doing so, the interview went on too long and took out  
some of the joy of the occasion, then I want to say to baseball 
fans everywhere that I'm very sorry about this.''

<HEADLINE> Trials Ordered in Wis. Rapes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- A judge on Tuesday ordered trials for five  
suspects in the alleged rapes of four Wisconsin teen-age girls who 
testified they were repeatedly raped while held captive in a home. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities were searching for seven more suspects named in  
warrants Monday, accusing them of 16 counts of first-degree 
criminal sexual conduct, Michigan's equivalent of rape. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge bound the first five suspects over for trial, each on  
several counts of criminal sexual conduct. The move ended a two-day 
hearing that included nine hours of testimony by the girls. 
</P>
<P>
	The girls, ages 14, 15, 16 and 17, and the suspects are  
Laotian-Americans and members of the Hmong ethnic group. 
</P>
<P>
	The girls testified they were repeatedly raped over several days  
after being brought to Detroit and kept in a house by several males 
they said threatened assault or death if they tried to flee. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradfield ordered the five to remain jailed in lieu of $1  
million bond apiece.

<HEADLINE> Analysts Assess Changes in Dow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Losing a spot on the Dow Jones industrial  
average may be more of a psychological setback than a substantive 
one, analysts and corporate officers said as four titans got their 
walking papers Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe their egos were stepped on a little bit,'' said Alfred  
E. Goldman, chief market strategist at A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc. 
``But I would hope no CEO worries about it one way or the other.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chevron Corp.; Goodyear Tire &AMP; Rubber Co.; Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co.,  
and Union Carbide Corp. all will be removed from the 30-stock 
indicator on Monday. Shares in all four fell Tuesday in heavy 
trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Companies removed from the list can take heart that their  
departures aren't necessarily forever: International Business 
Machines Corp., Coca-Cola Co., General Motors Corp., General 
Electric Co. and International Paper Co. are among companies once 
tossed out of the Dow that have made it back on. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course there are departures few remember these days, like  
some of the original Dow components in 1896 -- American Cotton Oil, 
Distilling &AMP; Cattle Feeding and National Lead. 
</P>
<P>
	The newcomers are Home Depot Inc., Intel Corp., Miocrosoft Corp.  
and SBC Communications Inc. All were selected by The Wall Street 
Journal to join the Dow industrials, and their shares were mixed, 
with Home Depot and Microsoft both falling Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow is closely watched as a measure of U.S. stock market  
performance, even though it only tracks 30 stocks. Membership in 
the exclusive club of blue-chips is a matter of prestige. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at Sears and Goodyear quickly expressed disappointment  
at losing their places and said they aren't about to be written off 
as relics. 
</P>
<P>
	At Sears, spokeswoman Peggy Palter termed the move  
``misguided.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``With more than $40 billion in revenues, 300,000 employees and  
relationships with 65 million households, Sears most certainly 
plays a relevant role in the U.S. economy,'' the nation's 
second-largest retailer said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodyear considers itself a bellwether for such diverse  
industries as transportation, construction and mining. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today's changes in the Dow 30 illustrate a business climate  
that favors the technology and service industries,'' Goodyear's 
executive vice president, Robert W. Tieken, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The inclusion of Nasdaq-listed Intel and Microsoft marked the  
first time ever that companies were chosen for the Dow that are not 
listed on the New York Stock Exchange. The shakeup in the Dow, the 
first since another four-stock shift in 1997, also marked a heavier 
weighting in technology. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel and Microsoft, the most influential players in personal  
computers, welcomed their admission to the Dow club, with Microsoft 
spokeswoman Caroline Boren terming it ``a recognition of the value 
and positive impact that technology companies ... have had on the 
nation's economy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some analysts saw this as a victory of sorts for Nasdaq, the  
upstart market where these and other high-tech stocks trade. 
</P>
<P>
	But William Meehan, chief market analyst for Cantor Fitzgerald  
in Darien, Conn., said investors ``realize that Intel and Microsoft 
aren't tiny companies that trade on the Nasdaq because they don't 
qualify for listing on the New York Stock Exchange.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meehan said that some of the heavy activity in the stocks on  
Tuesday reflected traders rearranging portfolios before next week 
when investments tied directly to the Dow will have to reflect the 
new makeup of the average. 
</P>
<P>
	These include some $160 million in mutual funds that hold the  
same stocks as are included in the Dow industrials and ``diamond'' 
unit trusts traded on the American Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Meehan and others suggested that the Dow's keepers could have  
considered removing at least one other stock in its last change 
this century -- Phillip Morris Cos. Inc. The $74 billion food, beer 
and tobacco conglomerate, which is the world's largest cigarette 
maker, already has agreed to multibillion-dollar settlements of 
smoking-related lawsuits with the states and faces potentially huge 
judgments in pending cases brought by smokers.

<HEADLINE> 70 Injured in Ind. Bus Collision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SULLIVAN, Ind. (AP) -- A tractor-trailer slammed into a school  
bus stopped at a railroad crossing Tuesday morning, driving it into 
a second bus and injuring about 70 people. 
</P>
<P>
	A 16-year-old girl was seriously injured in the early morning  
crash and was in serious condition at a hospital with multiple 
fractures to her legs. The truck driver underwent surgery for 
abdominal injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Mot of the others suffered only bumps and bruises, authorities  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The buses were taking special education students, teachers and  
chaperones from Lincoln High School in Vincennes to the Children's 
Museum in Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	The crashes sent the school buses off either side of the road  
and onto their sides. The rig went off the right side, leaving one 
of its two trailers in an embankment. 
</P>
<P>
	Rescuers had to pull the driver and five students, including two  
in wheelchairs, out of one bus. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was chaotic. When we got here, there were people all  
over,'' said State Police Sgt. Herb Jones. ``If you can imagine, 75 
kids were screaming and yelling to get out of the school bus.''

<HEADLINE> Hot Dogs Recalled for Listeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Citing possible listeria contamination, a meat  
processor is recalling skinless beef frankfurters that it 
distributed nationwide from a New York City plant. 
</P>
<P>
	Marathon Enterprises Inc. of East Rutherford, N.J., recalled all  
its Oct. 13 production, about 52,000 pounds of franks, and 
voluntarily closed the Bronx facility the next day. State 
inspectors found evidence of the bacteria that causes listeriosis, 
an unusual but potentially fatal disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Subsequent testing by the company prompted it to expand the  
recall Tuesday, according to the Agriculture Department. 
</P>
<P>
	No illness has been traced to the product, USDA officials said.  
It was not known how much meat is involved in the expanded recall. 
</P>
<P>
	All 16-ounce and 5-pound packages of ``Sabrett'' brand and  
``Western Beef'' brand skinless beef franks with ``EST 8854'' 
inside the USDA seal of inspection are subject to the recall. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although we have no evidence of illness as a result of  
consumption of these products, we decided to err on the side of 
caution and conduct a national recall,'' Boyd Adelman, Marathon's 
executive vice president, said. ``We will work closely with the 
USDA and other government agencies to ensure the health and safety 
of the public.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Healthy people rarely contract listeriosis, but it can cause  
fatal infections in people with weakened immune systems.

<HEADLINE> Newton Signs With Las Vegas Casino </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Forty years after he began performing at a  
downtown lounge as a teen-age crooner, Wayne Newton has signed what 
he says is the biggest contract of his career. 
</P>
<P>
	The 10-year deal calls for him to perform 40 weeks a year, six  
nights a week, at the Stardust hotel-casino on the Las Vegas Strip. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal was announced Tuesday by Newton and William Boyd,  
chairman and chief executive officer of Boyd Gaming Corporation, 
the Stardust's parent corporation. 
</P>
<P>
	``To have 'the King of Las Vegas' as our headliner is an  
incredible way to bring the Stardust into the 21st century,'' Boyd 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 920-seat showroom which currently hosts the ``Enter the  
Night'' production will be renamed the Wayne Newton Theatre when he 
begins his regular run Jan. 24, 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Newton declined to reveal terms of the contract, citing a  
nondisclosure agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can tell you that if you put all my contracts together over  
the years, it wouldn't equal this,'' he said.

<HEADLINE>  Taiwan Opens Software Park </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Taiwan on Tuesday inaugurated a computer  
software park that it hopes will bolster the value of the island's 
computer hardware products. 
</P>
<P>
	In the ceremony, President Lee Teng-hui said the park was built  
to help turn Taiwan into a ``high-tech island'' and to capitalize 
on the fast-growing software market. 
</P>
<P>
	The output of Taiwan's computer software industry could increase  
from $4.5 billion last year to $14 billion by 2005, Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 19 acre park in the Taipei suburb of Nankang is expected to  
accommodate 500 software firms in five years, park officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Taiwan is the world's top producer of computer monitors,  
keyboards and motherboards, and it produces about 40 percent of the 
notebook computers in the world. Taiwanese companies are trying to 
be more involved in software research to increase their profit 
margins.

<HEADLINE> Yanks, Braves Hope History Repeats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- If ever a team looked like it had no chance in  
the World Series, it was the New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	Three years ago, that is.  
</P>
<P>
	``When we won the first two games here in 1996, no one gave them  
a chance, either,'' Atlanta third baseman Chipper Jones said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``And they came back against our staff when they were in their  
prime. It's definitely a steep hill to climb, but it's possible,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Down 0-2 after a bumbling effort in a 7-2 loss, the Braves  
brushed up on their batting and history during an off-day workout 
at Yankee Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta is hoping to repeat the Yankees' performance of October  
1996, when New York overcame its shaky start to win four straight. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any team that has good pitching like we have, we can always  
reel off three in a row,'' Braves manager Bobby Cox said. ``We've 
always been able to do something like that. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's no different now,'' he said. ``But we've got to be  
hitting the ball a little better, too. They have great pitching.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Andy Pettitte will start for the Yankees in Game 3 tonight. As  
it stands, Tom Glavine is scheduled to pitch for the Braves. 
</P>
<P>
	Scratched from starting the opener because of the flu, Glavine  
has lost 5-to-7 pounds since then and looked pale Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know how much weight you can gain back eating soup and  
eating crackers. But I feel OK,'' Glavine said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know how my stamina's going to be, to be honest with  
you. I think if it was a summertime game and it was going to be 100 
degrees, I'd be a whole lot more concerned about it than I would be 
tomorrow, where it's going to be cool,'' he said. ``That obviously 
will help a whole lot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Glavine cannot pitch, John Smoltz will take his place.  
</P>
<P>
	Halfway to their second consecutive title and 25th overall, the  
Yankees have outpitched the club with the most vaunted rotation in 
the majors. Orlando ``El Duque'' Hernandez held the Braves to one 
hit for seven innings in the opener, then David Cone did the exact 
same thing in Game 2 Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Pettitte pitched the game of his life against Atlanta three  
years ago, outdueling Smoltz 1-0 at Atlanta to give the Yankees a 
3-2 edge in the Series. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was '96. The past doesn't mean much around here now,''  
Pettitte said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves won two of three at Yankee Stadium in July during  
interleague play. Of course, based on what everyone saw at Turner 
Field this weekend, it's hard to imagine Atlanta will last long 
unless it gets a lot better, a lot sooner in all areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Here's another tidbit: Never in their postseason history have  
the Braves been eliminated in a best-of-7 series in under six 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	As if it did not have enough things already in its favor, New  
York also gets to use the designated hitter for the games at Yankee 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	That means either Darryl Strawberry or Chili Davis will be in  
the lineup Tuesday night, both swinging potent bats. The Braves 
plan on using Jose Hernandez as their DH and, with Pettitte 
pitching, probably will have Eddie Perez, Bret Boone and Walt Weiss 
back in the lineup after a one-game benching. 
</P>
<P>
	``The demeanor is still the same, the mindset is still the  
same,'' Jones said. ``We've played well here in the past. 
Hopefully, we can draw on that and use it to our advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be tough. But we've still got life. We've still  
got some fight in us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees are aware of that. And of history, too.  
</P>
<P>
	``It'll benefit us,'' first baseman Tino Martinez said. ``We'll  
be focused and guard against being complacent.''

<HEADLINE> NYC Wants Homeless People To Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Nica Person, a 26-year-old mother of three who  
lives in a Bronx homeless shelter, can't believe what she's hearing 
from New York policy makers. 
</P>
<P>
	A plan to go into effect this winter would require her and  
thousands of other homeless parents to work in exchange for shelter 
-- or possibly have their children placed in foster care. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are parents who have four kids. They can't get day care  
to work. Who's going to pay for the day care?'' she asked. 
</P>
<P>
	A storm of angry reaction greeted Republican Mayor Rudolph  
Giuliani's announcement Tuesday that the city will seek to extend 
its welfare policy to 4,600 families in the shelter system. 
Eventually, 7,000 single adults in homeless shelters will also 
likely be required to work. 
</P>
<P>
	``Typical Republican simpleton logic,'' said Greg Bowens, a  
spokesman for Detroit Mayor Dennis Archer, a Democrat. ``Jesus was 
born in a manger. They didn't turn Mary away. Would Joseph and Mary 
get a spot in New York today? Amazing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New York is believed to be the only major U.S. city to impose a  
work-for-shelter requirement. The city already requires welfare 
recipients to work to get their benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	New York operates the largest, most comprehensive shelter system  
in the nation for a homeless population it estimates at 23,000. In 
other parts of the country, shelters are often run and financed by 
private charities -- some of which require people to seek work. 
</P>
<P>
	The mayor's plan stunned advocates for the homeless.  
</P>
<P>
	``This could literally put hundreds, if not thousands of people  
on the streets,'' said Patrick Markee, a policy adviser for New 
York City's Coalition for the Homeless. 
</P>
<P>
	Maria Foscarinis, executive director of the National Law Center  
on Homelessness and Poverty in Washington D.C., said the policy 
appears to be unique in the nation, adding that it is ``horribly 
misguided.'' 
</P>
<P>
	City Council Speaker Peter Vallone, a Democrat, said Giuliani's  
move is ``a throwback to the days of Dickens. We cannot tolerate 
this morally or legally.'' Vallone acknowledged, however, that the 
City Council has little power to stop the policy. 
</P>
<P>
	The new requirements are supported by 1997 state regulations  
aimed at moving the homeless to work and ultimately to 
self-sufficiency. Last February, an appeals court ruled against the 
objections of advocates for the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani, who laughed when told that Vallone compared his policy  
to something out of Charles Dickens' novels, defended his plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``The apostles of dependency want to bring us back to where we  
had 1.1 million people on welfare and a city where dependency was 
the rule, working the exception,'' he said. ``I think this is the 
highest form of compassion and love -- to help people to help 
themselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani has made welfare reform a centerpiece of his  
administration. The work-for-a-bed rule is similar to requirements 
city welfare offices have used since 1995 to move more than 400,000 
people off public assistance. 
</P>
<P>
	Already, many homeless parents clean parks or do other jobs in  
exchange for welfare benefits while their children are in shelter 
day care centers. However, thousands of families are on a waiting 
list for child care. 
</P>
<P>
	It remains unclear what work will be required of homeless people  
with physical or mental disabilities, though city policy requires 
those seeking exemption from work requirements to undergo medical 
exams every few months. 
</P>
<P>
	Person said the jobs the city sends people to are often menial,  
not the type of jobs that could provide a decent living. 
</P>
<P>
	``That just puts me right back to welfare,'' she said. ``You  
have to give people bigger goals, bigger dreams.''

<HEADLINE> Bond Yields at Two-Year High / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices fell, pushing the yield on the  
30-year Treasury bond to a new two-year high Tuesday, as worries 
about the economy heating up aggravated interest rate concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell 11/32  
point, or $3.44 per $1,000, invested. Its yield, which moves 
inversely to the price, rose to 6.37 percent from 6.35 percent late 
Monday. That's the highest yield since the 6.42 percent reached 
Oct. 22, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonds fell as analysts squirmed about two economic reports due  
later this week, which could show the U.S. economy reaccelerating 
and reignite interest rate fears. Those reports include the gross 
domestic product and the employment cost index. 
</P>
<P>
	Signs of fast economic growth and rising wage pressures would  
likely fuel investor fears that the Federal Reserve will again 
raise interest rates to cool down the economy. The Fed's policy 
board next meets Nov. 16. 
</P>
<P>
	Higher interest rates hurts bond investors because they carry a  
fixed rate of return. 
</P>
<P>
	But there also were signs that the Fed's two interest rate  
increases earlier this year are cooling the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The Conference Board reported Tuesday that its index of consumer  
confidence, which is a measure of consumers' willingness to spend, 
fell for a fourth straight month in October. The drop was greater 
than analysts had expected. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market, prices for short-term securities rose  
1/32 percent to 1/16 percent, while intermediate treasury 
securities rose 3/32 percent to 7/32 percent, reported Bridge 
Telerate, a financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 5.13 percent as the  
discount fell 0.01 percentage point from Monday's Treasury auction 
to 4.99 percent. Six-month yields were 5.33 percent, as the 
discount was unchanged from Monday's Treasury auction at 5.12 
percent. One-year yields were 5.52 percent as the discount rose 
0.02 percentage point from late Monday to 5.23 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, rose to 5.18 3/4 percent from 5.06 1/4 percent on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds fell 1/8 point to 108 5/32. The average yield 
to maturity rose to 6.16 percent from 6.15 percent.

<HEADLINE> GOP Accuses Mo. Gov. of Lying </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Missouri Republicans alleged Tuesday  
that Democratic Gov. Mel Carnahan lied about the number of times he 
wore blackface for small-town minstrel shows almost four decades 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Carnahan replied that he never definitely claimed to have  
appeared one time, and said he was relying on distant memories. The 
65-year-old governor renewed his apologies for ever wearing 
blackface. 
</P>
<P>
	Carnahan is challenging Republican Sen. John Ashcroft for his  
Senate seat in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The state GOP released photographs of Carnahan in blackface  
while singing at a 1961 minstrel show sponsored by the Rolla 
Kiwanis Club, and watching on stage without makeup as others 
performed in blackface in 1962. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP said the photos showed Carnahan was trying to be  
deceptive when he said Monday that he recalled appearing in 
blackface only for a 1960 show in Rolla, his hometown. 
</P>
<P>
	John Hancock, executive director of the Missouri Republican  
Party, provided The Associated Press with 1961 and 1962 clippings 
from the Rolla Daily News. The GOP also issued a news release 
headlined: ``Carnahan Lied in his `Apology.''' 
</P>
<P>
	In April 1961, Carnahan was elected municipal judge in Rolla.  
Hancock said the young judge's apparent ``tolerance of mockery'' of 
black people raised questions about his fairness on the bench. 
</P>
<P>
	Hancock said the photographs proved that Carnahan was trying  
Monday to minimize his experiences wearing blackface. 
</P>
<P>
	The AP's audio tape of Monday's news conference showed that when  
Carnahan was asked when the Kiwanis Club had stopped sanctioning 
fund-raising minstrel shows, he replied: 
</P>
<P>
	``In the early 60s -- I don't know whether it was '60 or '61.  
There may have been one other, I do not know. I have not had the 
benefit of all the research my opponents have had.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A reporter then asked whether he had performed at any other time  
with a Kiwanis barbershop quartet while wearing blackface. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think so,'' Carnahan replied.  
</P>
<P>
	Carnahan said Tuesday that he has ``grown a lot'' in racial  
sensitivity since the early 1960s, and has cited his appointment of 
the first black Missouri Supreme Court judge in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	That judge, Ronnie White, was rejected for a federal district  
judgeship on Oct. 5. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashcroft helped defeat White's nomination, calling the judge  
soft on the death penalty and ``pro-criminal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ashcroft has denied assertions that he worked against White  
because the judge is black. Some black politicians have accused the 
senator of being a racist, although Carnahan himself hasn't leveled 
that charge. 
</P>
<P>
	Hancock said he also wasn't labeling Carnahan a racist.  
</P>
<P>
	``I just see this as setting the record straight. I don't  
believe Mel Carnahan is a racist. I do believe he has a fair 
difficulty with the truth,'' Hancock said. 
</P>
<P>
	Margaret Bush Wilson, a St. Louis lawyer and former national  
board chairman of the NAACP, called the new attention to the old 
photographs ``absurd.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Thirty-nine years ago a lot of people were bigoted, including  
a lot of people who dredged this stuff up. I think we need to get 
on with the business of today and stop this nonsense,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> New Air Bags Reduce Deaths </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Most newer vehicles have less powerful air  
bags than autos several years old and that is resulting in fewer 
passenger deaths and serious injuries from the devices, according 
to a federal safety agency's report. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration report  
provides details for the first time on how the design of air bags 
has changed during the 1990s among eight top automakers that 
control more than 90 percent of the vehicle market. 
</P>
<P>
	Redesigned air bags, which were tested by the agency, pose less  
risk of death or serious injury to passengers, says the report, 
which was released Tuesday. And the agency said real-world crash 
data also confirm the design changes are leading to fewer deaths 
from the safety devices, particularly among adults. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is clear that air bags in recent model year 1998 and 1999  
vehicles are less aggressive than the pre-model year 1998 air 
bags,'' the agency concludes. 
</P>
<P>
	Starting with the 1998 model year, many automakers said they  
were installing car air bags with at least 20 percent less force. 
</P>
<P>
	The change was in response to a public outcry over deaths in  
low-speed crashes blamed on air bags. 
</P>
<P>
	Automakers welcomed the report. ``This is showing depowered air  
bags have a positive effect on safety,'' said Gloria Bergquist of 
the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the design changes outlined by the safety agency, about  
half of vehicles from model years 1998 and 1999 have driver and 
passenger air bags with a lower inflation force. The speed of 
inflation decreased about 22 percent on average for driver air bags 
and 14 percent for passenger air bags for the 1998 and 1999 models, 
the report says. 
</P>
<P>
	The manufacturers reviewed were General Motors, Ford,  
DaimlerChrysler, Honda, Toyota, Nissan, Volkswagen and Volvo. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency did not single out manufacturers by name, claiming  
much of the data submitted by companies were confidential and 
proprietary. Some safety groups objected to that. 
</P>
<P>
	``The public has a right to know which air bags are better so  
consumers can pick the better vehicles,'' said Clarence Ditlow of 
the Center for Auto Safety, one of several consumer groups suing 
the agency for more detailed information. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1990, air bags have been blamed for 146 deaths, mostly  
among unrestrained or improperly restrained children and shorter 
women, according to agency data. 
</P>
<P>
	But there have been few air bag deaths in vehicles from the 1998  
and 1999 model years, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	There was little change in the driver air bag fatality rate  
between model years 1992 and 1997. But officials have yet to 
attribute a single driver death to air bags in model 1999 vehicles 
and there was a significant reduction in the driver fatality rate 
in 1998 vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been two deaths that could be tied to passenger-side  
air bags in 1999 vehicles, the agency said, but that is a steep 
drop from the 1994 to 1997 model years that have totals of between 
16 and 50 deaths. 
</P>
<P>
	Agency testing showed significant reductions in neck injury  
measurements on dummies representing shorter adults and children 
for 1999-model air bags compared to 1997 models. However, a 
6-year-old child dummy placed directly over a 1999 air bag as it 
deployed still registered a significant risk of serious neck 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Automakers are working on methods to prevent air bags from  
deploying when children are too close.

<HEADLINE> High Schoolers Taking Prep Courses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Erin Horne, a high school junior, was dreading the  
idea of applying to colleges -- until she sat in on an admissions 
counseling course. 
</P>
<P>
	``As soon as I started I thought `Oh my God -- all my friends are  
going to be so behind,''' said the 16-year-old, who took a trial 
run at a course offered by Kaplan Educational Centers in 
Providence, R.I. earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Kaplan, best known for its SAT preparation courses, has just  
begun offering classes for jittery high school seniors nervous 
about applying to colleges. The courses, which cost $699, gives 
students tips on how to enhance their chances of getting into the 
school of their choice. 
</P>
<P>
	This week, Kaplan's college admissions seminars began on the  
East Coast, with a national rollout expected early next year. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York City-based company is among a growing number of  
others cashing in on a nationwide basis. 
</P>
<P>
	Achieva, based in Palo Alto, Calif., is also planning a national  
launch of the individual admissions sessions it has been offering 
in-state students for two years. The course averages $2,000 per 
student. 
</P>
<P>
	Such fees are well-spent considering a student might pay up to  
$120,000 for four years of education at an elite private school, 
course promoters say. 
</P>
<P>
	``When (parents are) going to be making that kind of investment,  
they want to make sure that they're going to the right school and 
the best school they can get their child into,'' said Steven 
Feuling, Achieva's vice president of marketing. 
</P>
<P>
	Some college admissions officers, however, caution that private  
admissions counselors prey on an anxious clientele. 
</P>
<P>
	``It should never be presumed that someone ... has an edge in  
the admissions process and that they will somehow be provided with 
a magic bullet to admission to the college of their choice,'' said 
Teresa Duffy, admissions dean at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute 
in Troy, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	But Erin is convinced the Kaplan course has given her an edge  
over her classmates, as she considers applying to universities of 
Massachusetts, Connecticut and Vermont. 
</P>
<P>
	Until now, the Swansea, Mass., resident was afraid of the  
application process. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now,'' she said, ``I'm psyched for it.''

<HEADLINE> NY Mayor Takes Campaign Upstate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TROY, N.Y. (AP) -- New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani took his  
Republican Senate campaign and crime-fighting message upstate 
Tuesday, where he asked voters to give him a chance to ``make this 
happen for the entire state.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``In reducing crime and in making sure a neighborhood like this  
is safe, people are given more freedom,'' Giuliani said as he 
campaigned with Carmella Mantello, the local GOP mayoral candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	``People shouldn't have to lock their doors at night, worry  
about going out on the street, worry about going out to a movie, or 
going to a library,'' he said. ``People don't have freedom when 
they live in conditions like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani and Mantello held a news conference on a street corner  
surrounded by rundown buildings that allowed Mantello to stress her 
crime-fighting agenda and Giuliani to boast about cleaning up New 
York City. That is likely to be a major theme of the Senate 
campaign next year that is expected to pit him against Hillary 
Rodham Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked about criminals fleeing New York City for the  
possible easier pickings upstate because of his crime crackdown, 
Giuliani said: ``Maybe you can make me your senator and I can make 
this happen for the entire state.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With chants of ``Rudy, Rudy, Rudy!'' breaking out from a crowd  
of several dozen placard-waving Mantello supporters, Giuliani 
obviously was the star of the show. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you go anyplace, they perceive the mayor as an actual  
national hero, for fighting crime, for getting rid of the Mafia in 
New York City, beating the criminals, the drug pushers and making 
New York City a safe place,'' Republican state Assemblyman Pat 
Casale told the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	At a subsequent news conference, Giuliani said he thinks Mrs.  
Clinton plans to run a negative campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``If history is any guide, I expect it,'' the mayor said.  
</P>
<P>
	``I saw it happen last time between the Clintons and Senator  
Dole. There were about six months of vicious attacks on Senator 
Dole and then when he responded, he was accused of campaigning 
negatively,'' Giuliani said. 
</P>
<P>
	The mayor's comments came the day after a Broadway-based  
birthday party fund-raiser for Mrs. Clinton that featured ample 
Giuliani bashing. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is typical, I think, of what we're going to see,''  
Giuliani told Albany's WROW-AM radio Tuesday during a morning 
interview. ``This has been pretty much the way Clinton campaigns 
have been run.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I just want you to store this one up as an example so that if,  
at some point, I respond you'll understand why,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton camp said it was Giuliani who was guilty of the  
negative campaigning. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rudy Giuliani has been running a negative campaign since he  
launched his anti-Hillary Clinton Web site in March and he's been 
attacking the first lady ever since,'' said Howard Wolfson, a 
spokesman for Mrs. Clinton's political committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani, meanwhile, also said Pat Buchanan was a ``terrible  
burden'' for the Republican Party. Buchanan left the GOP and joined 
the Reform Party on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately Pat had become a really negative force for some  
time,'' Giuliani said. ``I think this will help the Republican 
Party ultimately to reach more people.''

<HEADLINE> Japanese Stocks Close Higher / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The U.S. dollar slipped against the yen Tuesday on  
continued uncertainty over U.S. stock prices. Japanese shares edged 
higher in lackluster trading. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 105.16 yen at midafternoon, down 0.80 yen from  
late Monday and also below its late New York level of 105.31 yen 
overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 23.00  
points, or 0.13 percent, to close the day at 17,671.79. On Monday, 
the average closed up 209.99 points, or 1.20 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar's retreat came in line with a  
similar overnight trend in New York, where the greenback fell 
against the yen and other major currencies amid weakness Monday in 
U.S. stock and bond markets. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wall Street, equities and bonds were hit by renewed fears  
over rising interest rates. Stock traders worry that further 
increases in U.S. rates would reduce corporate profits. 
</P>
<P>
	At the close of Monday's session, the Dow Jones industrial  
average stood at 10,349.93, down 120.32 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders will be watching for signs that the U.S. economy is  
overheating, something that could prompt the Federal Reserve to 
raise interest rates. The Fed will meet next month. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 112.04 yen, down  
from 112.76 yen late Monday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, trading remained sluggish as many investors  
were holding back ahead of the release of several key domestic 
economic indicators later this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``Having made a lot of money in Japan this year a lot of foreign  
investors are happy to sit on their hands and not take any new 
risks for a while,'' said Garry Evans, a strategist at HSBC 
Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Economic data to be released include Japan's preliminary  
industrial production index, due out Wednesday, and unemployment 
figures for September on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section climbed 8.82 points, or 0.57 percent, to close at 
1,543.09. The TOPIX closed up 20.34 points, or 1.34 percent, the 
day before. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond  
stood unchanged from Monday's finish of 1.8950 percent. Its price 
was at 99.19.

<HEADLINE> Former Mayor Convicted in Sex Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORT HURON, Mich. (AP) -- Port Huron's tattooed,  
motorcycle-riding former mayor, once hailed as a role model for 
overcoming drugs and alcohol, was convicted Tuesday of exposing 
himself to nine underage girls. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Peter Deegan immediately sentenced Gerald ``Ajax''  
Ackerman, 42, to a year in prison on the nine counts of indecent 
exposure. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury couldn't reach verdicts on 16 other counts of sexual  
misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
	``This conviction on these counts has nothing to do, Mr.  
Ackerman, with what you've done for this community. ... You could 
have won the Nobel Prize for Peace and if you would have acted this 
way this sentence would be the same,'' Deegan said. 
</P>
<P>
	The allegations involved 11 girls ages 8 to 15. In one instance,  
three girls -- 9, 11 and 13 -- testified that they were together when 
Ackerman told them to take off their clothes and then performed 
oral sex on them. 
</P>
<P>
	Ackerman testified that he did nothing sexually inappropriate to  
any of his underage accusers. He acknowledged two affairs with 
teen-agers -- who were not among his accusers -- and said there was a 
possibility that four girls could have seen him exposed 
accidentally. 
</P>
<P>
	Ackerman, who once sported a ponytail, leather clothes and  
tattoos, was named Michigan Public Citizen of the Year in 1994. He 
was elected mayor of Port Huron three years later and resigned in 
April, one day after charges were filed. 
</P>
<P>
	Before he was escorted from court in handcuffs, Ackerman told  
the judge: ``I'm willing to accept my convictions. ... I spent 12 
years in this community doing everything I could to contribute. 
I've helped numerous children in this community over a number of 
years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Peter George said he expects to retry Ackerman on the  
16 other charges.

<HEADLINE> Penn St. Foe Coming Off an Upset </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STATE COLLEGE, Pa. (AP) -- With a 35-29 upset over No. 15  
Michigan last weekend, Illinois scrapped No. 2 Penn State's plans 
for the easy week coach Joe Paterno wanted. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been in two tough, physical, emotional games the last  
two weeks,'' Paterno said Tuesday. ``Now all of a sudden Illinois 
gets a hot streak.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the Big Ten Conference especially bruising this fall -- only  
Penn State (8-0, 4-0) remains undefeated -- who knows whether the 
Nittany Lions can keep sidestepping upsets? 
</P>
<P>
	Neither of Paterno's quarterbacks is 100 percent as Penn State  
prepares to visit Champaign: starter Kevin Thompson has a sore 
shoulder and Rashard Casey a bruised chest. 
</P>
<P>
	And the Lions are coming off a pounding game against Ohio State  
and a down-to-the-wire victory at Purdue. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we had a couple of easy games where we could play a lot of  
kids, it wouldn't wear on us as much,'' Paterno said. ``We've got 
defensive kids who played 85 plays Saturday in a very, very frantic 
football game. That takes a toll on you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson looked fine in Penn State's 31-25 victory Saturday,  
throwing TD passes of 39 and 78 yards. One week earlier, he'd 
suffered a separated shoulder on a hit by Buckeyes linebacker Na'il 
Diggs. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, his shoulder felt sore, but he should continue his  
string of starts for Paterno. 
</P>
<P>
	Casey took a shot to the chest from Purdue linebacker Willie  
Fells and was spitting up blood, but after X-rays, doctors cleared 
him to practice this week. Paterno said Casey should be ready to 
play, but he asked quarterbacks coach Dick Anderson to make sure 
the other two backups are ready. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm concerned about that,'' he said. ``We have to spend more  
time with Matt Senneca and Chad Kroell just in case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Illinois, the Lions are not expecting to see the same team  
they routed by 41-6 and 27-0 the past two years. These Illini (4-3, 
1-3) actually believe they can win. Coming back from 20 points down 
against Michigan -- in Ann Arbor -- to snap a three-game skid does 
that for a team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't expect the game to be like last year,'' LaVar  
Arrington said. 
</P>
<P>
	He wouldn't, however, be surprised to run into at least one  
familiar face: Elmer Hickman, the fullback Arrington smothered when 
he hurdled the offensive line on fourth-and-1 in his most famous 
moment. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure Elmer Hickman is going to try and run me over every  
chance he gets,'' Arrington said. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest of the Lions defense is more concerned with Kurt  
Kittner, who completed 24-of-33 passes for 280 yards with no 
interceptions and two TDs against Michigan. Paterno said those 
sound more like a line for Purdue's quarterback than Illinois'. 
</P>
<P>
	``His performance against Michigan -- it was like a Drew Brees  
performance,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson, actually, is happy Illinois upset the Wolverines. At  
least it keeps Penn State from underestimating them on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``They probably have a lot of enthusiasm in that practice  
facility this week. They're going to be pumped up. It's definitely 
good for us,'' he said. ``We know we have to keep working as hard 
as we've been working the last eight weeks. We have four tough 
weeks to make our dreams come true.''

<HEADLINE> Court Broadens FOIA Requests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal appeals court made it easier Tuesday  
to obtain information the government does not want to release, 
ruling that otherwise-secret wiretap recordings played in open 
court must be surrendered under a freedom of information law. 
</P>
<P>
	A three-judge panel of the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the  
District of Columbia ruled unanimously that such recordings, if 
specifically identified in a Freedom of Information Act request, 
are subject to release as public records. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision was a victory for Salvatore Cottone, convicted on  
drug and racketeering charges as the result of a federal 
investigation into Colombian and Sicilian connections to drug 
trafficking in the District of Columbia and its northern Virginia 
suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1992, Cottone has been seeking access to secretly taped  
conversations played at his trial as evidence against him. A 
federal judge had barred access, ruling that the recordings were 
not subject to FOIA disclosure. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge relied on the FOIA's Exemption 3, which applies to  
materials Congress meant to keep secret, such as communications 
intercepted under federal wiretap laws. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday's decision said the trial judge was wrong. ``Until  
destroyed or placed under seal, tapes played in open court and 
admitted into evidence ... remain a part of the public domain,'' 
the appeals court said. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal law bars the government from destroying such evidence  
for 10 years, and federal prosecutors never sought to have the 
Cottone recordings sealed. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a very good ruling,'' said Rebecca Daugherty of the  
Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, which advocates 
greater access to government records. ``In the past, it's been hard 
to overcome (the FOIA's) Exemption 3, and it's wonderful the open 
court rule will apply even in the face of Exemption 3,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> World Series Notebook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Luis Sojo returned to the New York Yankees  
before Tuesday night's Game 3, following his father's funeral in 
Venezuela. 
</P>
<P>
	``My mother told me he'd want me to play,'' Sojo said. ``He's at  
peace now. It won't be hard for me to play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sojo's father died of a heart aneurysm in a New Jersey hospital  
last Thursday and he left the team to accompany the body to 
Venezuela. Sojo missed the first two games of the Series as the 
Yankees played a man short in Atlanta. But the Yankees kept him on 
the roster because of his experience in the infield. 
</P>
<P>
	Yankees manager Joe Torre decided to use Sojo as a late-inning  
defensive replacement for second baseman Chuck Knoblauch, who made 
26 errors during the regular season and has thrown erratically at 
times during the postseason. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I first heard my father died I thought I would go home  
and miss the World Series because I wouldn't be on the roster,'' 
Sojo said. ``But after talking it over with Joe and (general 
manager) Brian Cashman, they were really supportive.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *MOMENT OF SILENCE:* The Yankees held a moment of silence before  
the game for golfer Payne Stewart, who died in a plane crash 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart, 42, and five others were killed when the jet they were  
in nosedived into a South Dakota field after flying on auto pilot 
for 1,400 miles across the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Also killed were Stewart's sports agents Robert Fraley, 46, and  
Van Ardan, 45; and pilots Michael Kling, 43, and Stephanie 
Bellegarrigue, 27. Also believed to be aboard was Bruce Borland, 
40, a golf course designer. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *NEW JOB:* Atlanta's Jose Hernandez was glad to feel the  
unseasonably warm temperatures when he walked on the field before 
the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope it stays like this,'' said Hernandez, serving as  
designated hitter for the first time in a game that counted. ``When 
the weather is cold, it's hard to get stretched out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hernandez's only other experience as a DH came during a spring  
training game with the Chicago Cubs a few years ago. He got some 
advice on the role from Braves hitting coach Don Baylor. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll take it like being a pinch hitter,'' Hernandez said.  
``I'll keep myself loose and ready to hit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hernandez started most games at shortstop for the Braves after  
being acquired in a July 31 trade from the Cubs, but Walt Weiss 
reclaimed the job during the NL Championship Series. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't do anything about it,'' Hernandez said. ``But I was  
lucky to get traded here and play in the World Series. Right now, I 
would normally be eating dinner and playing with my kids. Thank God 
I got traded.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *WREN ON THE JOB:* Frank Wren is getting some on-the-job  
training during the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	Wren, fired after one season as general manager of the Baltimore  
Orioles, started to work in the Braves' front office last week, 
serving as the assistant GM to John Schuerholz. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a difficult time to come on board. Everyone's thoughts  
and efforts are directed toward winning a world championship,'' 
Wren said. ``I'll really settle in once the postseason is over. 
We'll be able to address some deeper issues, some planning issues, 
although we're doing some of that now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wren, hired by the Braves after Dean Taylor was named GM of the  
Milwaukee Brewers, said he already has an offer on his Baltimore 
house and plans to purchase a home on the south side of Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	He hopes to have his family -- wife, Terri, and their three young  
boys -- settled in by mid-December. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *FOND MEMORIES:* Almost three years to the day after heart  
transplant surgery, Frank Torre said he felt great and remembered 
getting a World Series ring in 1996 from his brother Joe, the 
Yankees manager. 
</P>
<P>
	``When he first told me he was getting back into managing, I had  
some concerns,'' Frank Torre said. ``But I said if you're going to 
go back into it, George Steinbrenner is probably the best guy to 
work for. But we never dreamed after four years, he'd be managing 
in his third World Series.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *JOB SEARCH:* Yankees third base coach Willie Randolph  
interviewed for the Milwaukee Brewers' managing job Tuesday and New 
York hitting coach Chris Chambliss gets his shot Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Randolph, who played one season with the Brewers, said he  
doesn't think his lack of experience as a manager hurts his 
chances. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think you need to have been a manager to be a  
manager,'' Randolph said. ``I'm not opposed to getting the 
experience. I haven't had the opportunity. I've coached for six 
years and we've been in the postseason five of them. I feel ready 
to go to the next level.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *ETC:* This was the 176th World Series game to be played in New  
York, 118 more than the states tied for second: Missouri and 
Pennsylvania. The Yankees were the home team for the 97th time. The 
Giants were at home 41 times, the Dodgers 28 and the Mets 10. ... 
Tom Glavine pitched for Atlanta, marking the third straight game 
started by a Cy Young Award winner. Four-time winner Greg Maddux 
pitched Game 1 for Atlanta and 1994 winner David Cone started the 
second game for New York. John Smoltz, who won in 1996, and 
five-time winner Roger Clemens are scheduled to pitch Game 4. Never 
before has every game of a Series been started by a Cy Young 
winner.

<HEADLINE> Intel, Microsoft Added to Dow 30 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Punctuating technology's dominance on Wall  
Street and Main Street, Intel and Microsoft are being added to the 
Dow Jones industrial average, replacing Chevron, Goodyear and other 
stocks symbolic of an economy once dominated by smokestacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other venerable names, Sears Roebuck and chemical maker  
Union Carbide, are also being removed from the Dow, making room for 
home-improvements retailer Home Depot and the Baby Bell telephone 
company SBC Communications. 
</P>
<P>
	The changes announced Tuesday by The Wall Street Journal,  
creator and custodian of 30-stock Dow average, take effect Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The selection of Intel and Microsoft, both of which trade on the  
Nasdaq Stock Market, marks the first time the Journal has chosen 
companies not listed on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	But more significant than Nasdaq's symbolic victory against the  
207-year-old NYSE is the decision to scratch an arbitrary rule that 
kept some of the most dynamic names in technology and the overall 
economy from being reflected in Wall Street's best-known barometer. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel, for example, is the world's biggest supplier of the  
semiconductors that serve as the brains for computers. And 
Microsoft is the No. 1 maker of the software to runs those 
computers and programs for more specific tasks. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics of the Dow, created in 1896, had long argued that the  
average contained too few stocks that reflect the technology and 
information revolution that has been reshaping the U.S. and global 
economies over the past two decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel and Microsoft will join International Business Machines  
and Hewlett-Packard, itself added to the Dow less than three years 
ago, giving the average four pure technology components. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd say `hooray!' It's been a long time coming,'' said A.  
Marshall Acuff Jr., equity strategist at Salomon Smith Barney. 
``The Dow has reflected the old economy of the last 50 or more 
years and these changes today are another step in bringing the 
index in line with the new economy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To that end, the Dow will also get a healthy dose of the  
Internet economy with the selection of SBC Communications. As the 
nation's largest local telephone company, the former Southwestern 
Bell is also the biggest provider of Internet access, its wires 
reaching into nearly a third of all U.S. homes. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, SBC may be the most suitable successor to the railroad  
companies that were the driving force in the economy a century ago. 
While trucks and planes now dominate the shipping industry, 
railroads have re-emerged as a conduit for a different kind of 
freight -- their tracks providing ready-made routes for fiber-optic 
cables and the explosion of Internet commerce. 
</P>
<P>
	But despite the Internet's growing importance, analysts said  
it's too soon to add a pure Internet company such as America Online 
to the Dow because the industry is still so young. 
</P>
<P>
	The changes in the Dow's composition will not produce an  
immediate change in its value. The average is computed by combining 
the stock prices of all 30 companies and dividing by a special 
number calculated by the Journal. That divisor will be adjusted to 
reflect the changes and make sure the ``new'' Dow starts on Monday 
at the same value where the ``old'' Dow finished on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	But once trading begins next week, the Dow may behave a bit  
differently: rising more quickly with the addition of some 
faster-growing companies, and swinging more wildly with the 
fortunes of its volatile technology components. 
</P>
<P>
	Just last week, a profit warning by IBM sent that stock plunging  
more than 20 points -- or the equivalent of more than 100 Dow 
points. Nontechnology stocks rarely gyrate so violently. 
</P>
<P>
	With the loss of Chevron, the Dow's only energy company will be  
Exxon -- although notably, that company is set to almost double in 
size by merging with Mobil. 
</P>
<P>
	Union Carbide was one of only two chemical companies in the Dow.  
One reason the Journal chose to review the Dow's makeup now is that 
Union Carbide is being acquired by Dow Chemical Co. -- a company 
unrelated to Dow Jones &AMP; Co., the owner of the Journal and the 
industrial average's namesake. 
</P>
<P>
	But although Union Carbide and Dow Chemical will form the  
world's second-biggest chemical company, the newspaper apparently 
decided that No. 1 DuPont, the Dow's other chemical company, 
provides sufficient representation for that industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Likewise, Sears Roebuck is still the nation's second-largest  
retailer, but has been struggling for years to keep up with huge 
discount chains such as Wal-Mart Stores, which was added to the Dow 
during the last reconfiguration in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	And since Wal-Mart and Sears compete in many of the same areas,  
Home Depot will help reflect a different, increasingly lucrative 
part of the retail industry. 
</P>
<P>
	By the same token, since tires are sold by Wal-Mart and its  
Sam's Club subsidiary, it may not have seemed so important anymore 
for the Dow to have Goodyear, the world's largest tire maker. 
</P>
<P>
	Some critics argue that the Journal artificially pumps up the  
Dow by removing companies in decline -- or companies in declining 
industries -- and replaces them with dynamic names in fast-growing 
markets. A more accurate measure of the economy and the stock 
market, they say, would endure the bumps and the bruises of a 
company that's fallen on bad times. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the stocks added to the Dow list, two fell Tuesday. Home  
Depot fell $1.25 to $70.68 3/4; Microsoft dipped 6 1/4 cents to $92.37 1/2; 
Intel rose 12 1/2 cents to $71.37 1/2; and SBC climbed $1.31 1/4 to$45.56 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	All of the stocks taken out of the Dow fell Tuesday. Chevron  
fell $2 to $88; Goodyear fell $3.93 3/4 to $41.25; Sears dropped 
$1.87 1/2 to $27; and Union Carbide slipped 50 cents to $59.

<HEADLINE> Curtis Standing Tall After Homerun </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- As the ball sailed into the Atlanta Braves'  
bullpen, Chad Curtis pumped both fists into the air. And then he 
did it again. 
</P>
<P>
	Then came a high-five from coach Jose Cardenal at first base,  
and another from Willie Randolph at third. 
</P>
<P>
	He was flying around the bases, taking the jog of his life.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was special,'' Curtis said Tuesday night after his  
10th-inning home run off Mike Remlinger gave the Yankees a 6-5 win 
and a 3-0 World Series lead. ``I don't think -- in fact, I know -- 
I've never hit a walk-off home run. I've heard people talk about 
tingling. I've never felt that before -- the electricity running 
through my legs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last October, he sat and stewed during the Series against San  
Diego, never setting foot on the field during any game. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was very frustrating,'' Curtis said Tuesday. ``I played 152  
games. that's 152 out of 162.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the Yankees celebrated their sweep, he hurt.  
</P>
<P>
	``I felt more like I was congratulating my teammates than  
celebrating with them,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Then he sat again for Game 1 against Atlanta.  
</P>
<P>
	And Game 2.  
</P>
<P>
	But there he was Tuesday night, hitting the first World Series  
walk-off homer since Toronto's Joe Carter took Mitch Williams deep 
in Game 6 in 1993 to win the Series. 
</P>
<P>
	And what about that fifth-inning homer off Tom Glavine, the one  
that made it 5-2 and started the Yankees on their comeback? That 
was an old memory by now. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hadn't expected this kind of production,'' Yankees manager  
Joe Torre said. 
</P>
<P>
	All the other Yankees are well-known: Jeter and Williams,  
Knoblauch and O'Neill, Martinez and Brosius, Davis and Girardi. 
</P>
<P>
	But Curtis?  
</P>
<P>
	He was supposed to lose his job to Darryl Strawberry.  
</P>
<P>
	Or to Shane Spencer.  
</P>
<P>
	Or to Ricky Ledee.  
</P>
<P>
	Or to Tony Tarasco.  
</P>
<P>
	But when it was time to lead off the 10th inning, Curtis was  
there. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's always somebody you don't expect,'' Braves manager Bobby  
Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cox had remembered watching Curtis before the game.  
</P>
<P>
	``I was really amazed,'' Cox said, ``when he stood by the other  
players, how short he is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now Curtis, all 5-foot-10 of him, is standing tall.  
</P>
<P>
	No matter what else happens, he has that moment, a replay that  
will be shown over and over in Yankee Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hit it for my grandma,'' he said, still on the field with  
the game-winning ball, ``but I got to give it to my 2-month-old 
son.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Remlinger had just come in, and throughout the ballpark, there  
was the feeling the win was there for the taking. John Rocker had 
pitched his two innings, and the rest of the Braves' bullpen scares 
mainly their own fans. 
</P>
<P>
	Curtis fouled off the first pitch, then took a ball.  
</P>
<P>
	And then came the drive.  
</P>
<P>
	Left fielder Gerald Williams knew after two steps.  
</P>
<P>
	``I have a tendency in these situations to try and hit a home  
run,'' Curtis said. ``So, I went up there and tried to hit a liner 
up the middle, and I hit a homer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Funny how that happens.  
</P>
<P>
	But Curtis doesn't even know if he'll get back on the field for  
Game 4. 
</P>
<P>
	Will he start, Torre was asked?  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to wait and see what happens,'' he replied.

<HEADLINE> Paper, Martha Stewart Settles Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The National Enquirer and Martha Stewart have  
settled a $10 million lawsuit over a tabloid article titled 
``Martha Stewart Is Mentally Ill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart's federal lawsuit alleged libel and defamation of  
character over the Enquirer story published on Sept. 2, 1997, 
claiming Stewart ``indulged in self-mutilation and threatened 
suicide.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The tabloid also said the good-taste maven ``has frantic fears  
of being abandoned, a chronic sensation of feeling useless and 
empty, and a near-constant anger.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit filed by Stewart's attorney, Barry B. Langberg,  
sought $10 million in addition to unspecified punitive damages and 
attorney's fees. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart has said the story damaged her reputation as a model of  
civility and good living, bringing ``shame, mortification and 
emotional distress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Langberg confirmed Tuesday there was a settlement, but he said  
terms of the deal prevented release of any details. 
</P>
<P>
	``The matter was resolved, that's all I can tell you,'' National  
Enquirer attorney Greson Zweifach said.

<HEADLINE> Late-Term Abortion Bans Upheld </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                          *By MIKE ROBINSON    	
</P>
<P>
                      *Associated Press Writer    	
</P>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- In a victory for anti-abortion forces, a sharply  
divided federal appeals court on Tuesday upheld laws banning 
certain late-term abortions in Illinois and Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
	``We conclude that both laws can be applied in a constitutional  
manner,'' Judge Frank Easterbrook wrote in the majority opinion as 
the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals split 5-4 over the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision reversed a federal judge's ruling that the Illinois  
law was unconstitutional as well as a temporary order from an 
appeals panel that had blocked enforcement of the Wisconsin law. 
</P>
<P>
	The court did say there was a possibility that bans on what  
critics describe as ``partial-birth abortions'' could unfairly be 
applied to prohibit other types of abortions but said lower courts 
should act to prevent that. 
</P>
<P>
	The Center for Reproductive Law and Policy says 30 states have  
passed similar laws banning the procedure, and 20 have been barred 
by courts from enforcing them or at least sharply restricted. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in St. Louis  
struck down bans on the procedure in Nebraska, Arkansas and Iowa, 
calling them unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
	Abortion rights attorneys said they were deeply disappointed by  
Tuesday's ruling and indicated they probably would appeal to the 
U.S. Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
	``This decision creates a constitutional crisis which will  
probably go to the Supreme Court because it flies in the face of'' 
the high court's previous decisions, said Janet Benshoof, president 
of the New York-based Center for Reproductive Law and Policy. 
</P>
<P>
	She called it a ``radical decision'' that puts ``state interest  
in the fetus above women's health.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Susan Armacost, a lobbyist for Wisconsin Right to Life, said the  
decision shoots down arguments that the state's law was vague and 
would apply to other types of abortion. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a huge victory for the babies of Wisconsin that would be  
facing this heinous procedure if it had not been upheld,'' she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The procedure in question is known medically as a ``dilation and  
extraction.'' It involves reducing the size of the fetus' skull as 
part of the process of removing it. The court noted that reducing 
the skull ``causes the adverse public (and legislative) reaction'' 
to the procedure. 
</P>
<P>
	``The partial-birth abortion is a gruesome, abhorrent way to  
take a life,'' Wisconsin Gov. Tommy G. Thompson said in a 
statement. ``There's no place for partial-birth abortions in 
Wisconsin.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Wisconsin law, enacted last year, provides for life in  
prison for anyone performing the procedure except to save the 
mother's life. It was upheld in June by a federal judge, but an 
appeals panel granted a temporary order blocking enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
	The Illinois law was enacted in 1997. A federal judge ruled last  
year that it was unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief Judge Richard Posner, writing for the minority on the  
appeals court Tuesday, said the majority decision represented a 
compromise between the desire to ban the procedure and the fear 
that the laws would be enforced against other procedures that they 
were not meant to address. 
</P>
<P>
	He said ``the court does throw a bone to'' those seeking to lift  
the bans by ordering lower courts to limit how they may be 
enforced.

<HEADLINE> Two Die in Calif. Helicopter Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- A policeman was hailed as a hero after  
he apparently steered his spinning helicopter to the only vacant 
spot in a heavily congested area, dying in the crash along with his 
passenger, an aircraft mechanic. 
</P>
<P>
	``The pilot purposely pushed the (helicopter) into the ground  
because it was his only choice to avoid the inhabitants,'' said 
Police Chief Bill Lansdowne. The copter came to rest Monday near 
on-ramps to busy Interstate 880. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither the pilot nor the mechanic were identified by police,  
pending notification of their relatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses said the police helicopter, which was grounded over  
the weekend, was spinning before it crashed. Others said it 
appeared to be smoking at the back as people on the ground ran for 
cover. 
</P>
<P>
	``We heard a noise, a popping sound. It looked like it lost its  
rear rotor,'' said witness Robert Mannia. 
</P>
<P>
	Lansdowne said he did not know why the 5-year-old helicopter had  
been grounded over the weekend.

<HEADLINE> Lucent Breaking Into Four Divisions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MURRAY HILL, N.J. (AP) -- Lucent Technologies, the world's  
biggest telephone equipment maker, said Tuesday that it will break 
into four divisions in an effort to sharpen the company's focus on 
the high-growth areas of optical networking, wireless 
communications, semiconductors and e-business. 
</P>
<P>
	The four new divisions -- Service Provider Networks, Enterprise  
Networks, NetCare Professional Services and Microelectronics and 
Communications Technologies -- will be headed by current Lucent 
executives and will continue to operate under the Lucent umbrella. 
</P>
<P>
	In conjunction with Tuesday's announcement, the company reported  
several personnel shakeups and a 50 percent increase in its 
fourth-quarter profits, beating Wall Street expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	Lucent shares rose $3 to $62.87 1/2 in trading on the New York  
Stock Exchange 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the staff changes, chief operating officer Ben  
Verwaayen was named vice chairman in charge of international 
business, and Arun Netravali was chosen to replace Dan Stanzione as 
president of Bell Labs, the company's research arm. 
</P>
<P>
	Stanzione will serve as advisor to the company's chairman and  
chief executive officer, Richard McGinn. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Holder will oversee staffing and strategy for all four  
divisions. 
</P>
<P>
	Service Provider Networks will work with Internet service  
providers, telephone networks and other communications providers. 
</P>
<P>
	Enterprise Networks, which will consist of Lucent's current  
Business Communication Systems and Government Solutions as well as 
parts of InterNetworking Systems, will be responsible for voice and 
data solutions for small and large businesses, including the 
federal government. 
</P>
<P>
	Netcare Professional Services will be responsible for consulting  
and design and will look at future network possibilities for 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Microelectronics and Communications Technologies will include  
Lucent's microchip business and component equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	Lucent employs more than 150,000 people worldwide, including  
21,000 in New Jersey. The company does not expect layoffs as a 
result of the restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
	Lucent posted profits -- not including one-time expenses  
associated with mergers and acquisitions -- of $972 million, or 31 
cents per share, during the fourth quarter ended Sept. 30, compared 
with $647 million, or 21 cents per share, during the same quarter a 
year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The results topped expectations of analysts surveyed by First  
Call/Thomson Financial, who had been expecting 29 cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	Total revenues during the quarter were up 23 percent to $10.6  
billion from $8.6 billion the year before. 
</P>
<P>
	Lucent's revenue for the fiscal year ending Sept. 30 totaled  
$38.3 billion, a 20 percent increase over the previous year. Annual 
profits were up 46 percent to more than $3.8 billion, or $1.22 per 
share, from $2.6 billion, or 86 cents a share, last year.

<HEADLINE> First Lady Has Birthday Fund-Raiser </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A star-studded birthday bash emceed by Rosie  
O'Donnell raised $1 million for Hillary Rodham Clinton's likely 
U.S. Senate campaign, but President Clinton nearly stole the show 
with a tribute acknowledging he will soon be out of the spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
	``Y'all just relax while I get used to my new role, somewhere  
between ... the straight man for Rosie and the warm-up for Hillary. 
I'll figure out something to do,'' the president said as he took 
the stage with his wife at the end of the Monday evening 
extravaganza. ``I am so grateful that now my wife has a chance to 
do what I thought she ought to do 26 years ago, when we finished 
law school.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As the audience applauded, the Clintons embraced for several  
minutes before the first lady, who turned 52 today, blew out the 
candles on a 4-foot-tall red, white and blue birthday cake. An 
on-stage cast sang ``Happy Birthday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All 1,820 tickets -- ranging from $250 to $1,000 -- were sold for  
the gala at the Ford Center for the Performing Arts, where the 
crowd was entertained by the likes of Chita Rivera, Bebe Neuwirth, 
Lauren Bacall and Joel Grey. 
</P>
<P>
	The show opened with a Hillary look-alike in blonde wig, black  
pantsuit and practical pumps, singing, ``I'll take Manhattan, the 
Bronx and Staten Island, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The performer, Christine Pedi, from the cast of ``Forbidden  
Broadway,'' a spoof of Broadway shows, then launched into a 
rewritten ``New York, New York,'' accompanied by a chorus of 12 
guys in New York Yankees uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
	``These Washington blues are washing away, she'll make a brand  
new start of it, in old New York,'' they sang. 
</P>
<P>
	Actress Mia Farrow, who has 14 children, 10 of them adopted,  
read aloud from Mrs. Clinton's book, ``It Takes a Village and Other 
Lessons Children Teach Us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Each of us plays a part in every child's life: It takes a  
village to raise a child,'' she read. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, after Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., wished Mrs. Clinton  
``many more happy birthdays right here in New York,'' Mrs. Clinton 
said: ``I hope that I will have a chance sometime to work with 
Chuck Schumer, to be a voice for the children of New York, all of 
the children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Between acts, Ms. O'Donnell poked fun at Mayor Rudolph Giuliani,  
Mrs. Clinton's likely opponent in the Senate race. 
</P>
<P>
	``Giuliani is very jealous,'' the comedian quipped. ``He's going  
to write his own book: 'It Takes a Village Idiot.''' 
</P>
<P>
	At another point, she said: ``The cast of (the musical) 'Smokey  
Joe's Cafe' wanted to be here, but the mayor had them arrested 
outside the theater for loitering.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No spokesperson for Giuliani was available for comment last  
night. 
</P>
<P>
	Judith Light, who stars in the Pulitzer Prize-winning play  
``Light,'' read from the writings of Eleanor Roosevelt, one of Mrs. 
Clinton's muses, then added: ``The concerns of Eleanor Roosevelt 
are the concerns of Hillary Clinton.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marc Kudisch, who stars in ``The Scarlet Pimpernel,'' saluted  
the first lady with ``My Gal Hill,'' a rewrite of the song ``My Boy 
Bill'' from the old musical ``Carousel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``She'll travel on until she's Senator Hillary, but if it ever  
gets lonely on the hill, then Hill comes home to me,'' Kudisch 
sang. 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani's campaign is selling tickets to the Broadway show  
``Saturday Night Fever'' in hopes of raising $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Politicians using the performing arts to raise money is nothing  
new. The 1962 bash at Madison Square Garden at which Marilyn Monroe 
breathily crooned ``Happy Birthday'' to President Kennedy raised $1 
million for the Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, a 50th birthday bash for President Clinton at Radio  
City Music Hall raised $10 million for his party.

<HEADLINE> Ky. Gov. Demands Funds for Cleanup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Kentucky Gov. Paul Patton demanded more  
federal money and elbow grease Tuesday to clean up an Energy 
Department uranium plant that has endangered workers and still 
threatens the environment. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's time for the federal government to do right by the city  
of Paducah, a city that's been loyal to this plant for 47 years,'' 
Patton said at a Senate hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	The Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant in western Kentucky has  
processed uranium for use by the military and in nuclear power 
reactors since 1952. 
</P>
<P>
	Three plant employees have filed a federal lawsuit alleging  
workers there unwittingly were exposed to plutonium and other 
highly toxic substances from 1953 to 1976. The lawsuit is sealed. 
</P>
<P>
	However, a recent DOE investigation looking back to 1990 found  
that worker safety and environmental problems have persisted during 
a federal efforts to clean up the plant. 
</P>
<P>
	The report, released last week, said plant workers have not been  
adequately informed of some risks and that radioactive 
contamination from the site continues to spread through groundwater 
toward the Ohio River at a rate of a foot a day. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress has provided a $16 million increase for the cleanup in  
its fiscal 2000 budget. 
</P>
<P>
	DOE officials, who had asked for $6 million more, agreed with  
Patton that that won't be enough to fulfill promises the federal 
government has made to the state to accelerate the cleanup and 
increase health monitoring of workers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I understand and share everyone's concern that we have not  
moved ahead fast enough,'' said Carolyn Huntoon, DOE assistant 
secretary for environmental management. ``The reality is we have 
lacked the money we have needed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky, who presided over Tuesday's hearing  
in the Senate Appropriations energy and water subcommittee, 
encouraged Huntoon to ask for more money next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., who normally chairs the panel and  
also heads the Senate Budget Committee, said, however, that the 
government is ``massively oversubscribed'' in its nuclear cleanup 
obligations. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is more to do than can possibly be done in the  
foreseeable future,'' Domenici said. ``However, it is my intention 
... to continue in the establishment of priorities and to ensure 
that the federal government meets its obligations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Patton said Kentucky authorities estimate it will take an  
additional $100 million a year for the federal government to meet 
its obligations by 2010 as promised in a legal agreement with the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the governors of the neigh d boring states of Ohio and  
Tennessee have signed a letter to Congress asking for more money. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Steven B. Markowitz, who runs a DOE medical screening  
program for former Paducah plant workers, testified that some of 
the additional money is needed to extend health screenings to 
current workers and upgrade medical equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	David Michaels, assistant secretary of the DOE's environmental  
health and safety program said that the risk of public 
contamination at Paducah is currently not high, but ``additional 
steps are needed to prevent public health problems in the future.''

<HEADLINE> Redskins Sign Defenders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Trying to bolster their sagging defense, the  
second worst in the NFL after Cleveland, the Washington Redskins on 
Tuesday signed cornerback Mark McMillian and linebacker James 
Francis. 
</P>
<P>
	They placed linebacker Fred Strickland on injured reserve and  
released safety Toby Wright. 
</P>
<P>
	McMillian, 29, started the year with the San Francisco 49ers and  
played in six games before he was released Oct. 19. 
</P>
<P>
	An eight-year veteran, McMillian returned three interceptions  
for touchdowns in 1997 when he was with Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
	Francis, 31, was released by Cincinnati during training camp  
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	At the end of Week 7, the Redskins' defense was giving up an  
average of 393.3 yards per game. The Browns' defense was yielding 
405.9 yards a game.

<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A charity golf event scheduled Tuesday was  
canceled in Payne Stewart's honor, but the Pacific Bell Senior 
Classic will go on as scheduled, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The tournament office received many calls from golf fans  
wondering if the event was going to proceed,'' Toby Zwikel said. 
``We're taking our direction from the Senior PGA Tour, which has 
determined that the competition will go on as scheduled.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Ray Floyd Charity Challenge was called off after the Senior  
PGA Tour and PGA Tour canceled all events scheduled for Tuesday -- a 
day after Stewart, the U.S. Open champion, was killed in a plane 
crash. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd, Joe Inman, Dana Quigley and Billy Casper were scheduled  
to play in the five-hole charity match.

<HEADLINE> Some Memorable Political Debates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Some memorable lines from political debates, and a few forgotten  
ones: 
</P>
<P>
	--''There is no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe and there  
never will be under a Ford administration.'' President Ford, Oct. 
6, 1976, in San Francisco debate with Jimmy Carter. 
</P>
<P>
	--''I would like to see Mr. Ford convince the Polish Americans  
and the Czech Americans and the Hungarian Americans in this country 
that those countries don't live under the domination and 
supervision of the Soviet Union behind the Iron Curtain.'' Carter's 
retort. 
</P>
<P>
	--''I was the victim ... I was stiffed.'' A defensive Ronald  
Reagan, criticized for making ethnic jokes, blames the media for 
misreporting his humor in Feb. 20, 1980, Republican debate in 
Manchester, N.H. 
</P>
<P>
	--''Are you better off than you were four years ago?'' From  
Reagan's closing statement, Oct. 28, 1980, in Cleveland debate with 
President Carter. 
</P>
<P>
	--''I've said I'm going to stand up for special interest groups --  
uh, against special interest groups.'' Walter Mondale's flub in 
March 11, 1984, Democratic debate in Atlanta, taking some of the 
shine off his triumphant question to Gary Hart: ``Where's the 
beef?'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Q: ``Governor, if Kitty Dukakis were raped and murdered, would  
you favor an irrevocable death penalty for the killer?'' 
</P>
<P>
	A: ``No, I don't Bernard, and I think you know that I've opposed  
the death penalty all of my life.'' Michael Dukakis' unemotional 
response to Bernard Shaw's question about his wife in Oct. 13, 
1988, debate with George Bush in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	-- ``I'm sure it has. I love my grandchildren. ... I talk to  
parents. I mean, you've got to care.'' President Bush, Oct. 15, 
1992, when asked in Richmond, Va., debate with Bill Clinton and 
Ross Perot how the national debt had affected him personally. 
</P>
<P>
	--''Will I be able to speak for a second or two, from time to  
time?'' Perot complains about Vice President Gore's interruptions 
during ``Larry King Live'' debate on North American Free Trade 
Agreement, Nov. 9, 1993.

<HEADLINE> Treasury Head Optimistic About Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Key Democratic lawmakers called on President  
Clinton Tuesday to veto sweeping legislation to overhaul the 
financial services laws on grounds it would endanger consumers' 
privacy. 
</P>
<P>
	Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, meanwhile, met with a group  
of financial industry lobbyists and encouraged them to continue 
pushing for the legislation, according to two industry participants 
who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	A Treasury official said afterward that Summers and other  
officials told the industry group the administration was optimistic 
about the bill's prospects and would continue to work toward its 
passage. He also spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Clinton administration supports the bill,  
congressional Democrats are divided and it wasn't immediately clear 
whether House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., would endorse 
the measure or break with the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass., has been leading the fight for  
liberal House Democrats on the privacy issue as Congress has edged 
close to enacting the legislation, which would lift Depression-era 
barriers and allow banks, securities firms and insurance companies 
to merge. With the Clinton administration now supporting it, the 
measure is being given the best chance of adoption after 20 years 
of battling. 
</P>
<P>
	Many moderate Democrats in the House support the legislation.  
</P>
<P>
	Markey enlisted the aid of Rep. John Dingell of Michigan, senior  
Democrat on the House Commerce Committee, and Reps. Jay Inslee, 
D-Wash., and Bill Luther, D-Minn. 
</P>
<P>
	They circulated a letter to Clinton to their colleagues in the  
House. 
</P>
<P>
	The overhaul legislation ``does not go nearly far enough in  
ensuring that American consumers receive strong privacy 
protections,'' the letter says. ``We do not believe the bill ... 
adequately protects American consumers from the wholesale 
networking of their personal, private information.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Barry Toiv had no immediate comment on the  
letter. 
</P>
<P>
	Banks would not be allowed to provide customers' data to  
telemarketers under the new legislation, but would be able to share 
it with affiliated financial companies under the same corporate 
ownership. 
</P>
<P>
	Data sharing is a major reason why financial companies want to  
merge, as it opens numerous opportunities for the companies to 
market a range of products and services. 
</P>
<P>
	Many consumers are alarmed, however, at the prospect that their  
personal financial data could be shared by companies. Consumer 
activists such as Ralph Nader also have criticized the legislation 
on privacy grounds. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Senate, conservative Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., has  
broken with Banking Committee Chairman Phil Gramm, R-Texas, over 
the privacy issue and said he would vote against the bill. Shelby 
served notice on Monday that he will try to force changes in the 
privacy provisions and failing that, attempt to derail the measure. 
Under Senate rules, a single senator can hold up action for hours 
or days if he chooses to.

<HEADLINE> Padres' Gwynn Wins Clemente Award </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Tony Gwynn, who surpassed the 3,000-hit mark  
this season, was given the Roberto Clemente Man of the Year Award 
on Tuesday night before Game 3 of the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't begin to describe to you what a big thrill this is,''  
Gwynn said. ``As a kid, you hear about Roberto Clemente. I sat 
right behind him in right field at Dodger Stadium and was able to 
realize this guy doesn't get as much credit as some of the other 
guys do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn, who played for San Diego in last year's World Series  
against the New York Yankees, received the award for his work on 
the field and in the community. 
</P>
<P>
	``Coming back to Yankee Stadium tonight sent chills down my back  
again,'' Gwynn said. ``It's nice to be recognized not only for what 
you do on the field but what you do off. My wife and I try to make 
a difference.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn became the 22nd member of the 3,000-hit club on Aug. 6 at  
Montreal and is in 18th place all-time with 3,067 hits. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though he has not won a World Series, Gwynn is not looking  
to leave the Padres, the only team he has played for, to go to a 
team that has a better chance of winning. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you love a place as much as I love San Diego, it's going  
to be really hard to leave,'' he said. ``It's really going to take 
something of some kind of magnitude to make me want to go somewhere 
else. So I doubt if I will.''

<HEADLINE> Exporter Corruption Surveyed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- China is seen as the country whose exporters  
are most willing to pay bribes in business deals abroad, and 
Scandinavians are least likely to give or receive them, according 
to two surveys released Tuesday. The United States ranked in the 
middle. 
</P>
<P>
	The surveys, compiled by Transparency International, a private  
organization with chapters in 77 countries, focused attention for 
the first time not only on governments whose officials accept money 
but also nationalities perceived as those most likely to pay bribes 
and kickbacks to win contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our two indexes capture views on the two sides of the  
corruption coin,'' said Frank Vogl, vice chairman of the 
organization. ``They highlight the corruption conspiracy, where 
bribe-supplying companies come together with bribe-taking officials 
to defraud people in emerging-market countries.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The surveys come at a time of rising awareness of corruption's  
cost to both rich and poor nations. The World Bank and the 
International Monetary Fund long avoided the issue but now, seeing 
it as a major obstacle to economic progress, are waging aggressive 
campaigns for clean government. 
</P>
<P>
	Rankings in the Corrupt Perceptions Index, which for five years  
has cataloged the most corruption-ridden governments; and the new 
Bribe Payers Index, a look at where the most willing bribers 
operate from, are based on perceptions as measured in polls by 
Gallup International. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Bribe Payers Index, Vogl said, countries rather than  
private companies were ranked because there was no way to examine 
60,000 multinational companies and their 500,000 foreign 
affiliates. 
</P>
<P>
	He said, however, ``There should be no doubt that the BPI shows  
many firms in many leading industrial countries are seen to be 
using bribes in emerging-market countries.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Almost 800 senior business executives in 14 such countries were  
asked whose companies among the world's 19 leading exporting 
nations were the most likely to offer bribes. 
</P>
<P>
	Sweden, the only Scandinavian country among the 19 leading  
exporters, got the best score, 8.3 of a possible l0, meaning very 
little perceived corruption. Australia and Canada tied for second, 
while Taiwan, South Korea and China, including Hong Kong, brought 
up the rear. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most disappointing of all, ``Vogl said, is that the United  
States and other wealthy industrialized nations ``did not fare too 
well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The United States and Germany tied at No. 9, trailed by France,  
Japan and Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	The Corrupt Perceptions Index, a compilation of polls covering  
degrees of government corruption, was topped again by Scandinavia, 
with Denmark recording a perfect corruption-free 10. 
</P>
<P>
	It was followed by Finland, New Zealand, Sweden, Canada and  
Iceland, the same lineup as last year. 
</P>
<P>
	At the bottom of the 99-nation list were Azerbaijan, Indonesia,  
Nigeria and Cameroon.

<HEADLINE> Man Creates Charity, Kills Himself </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Hal Hovey could crunch numbers with the  
best, whether working with state budgets or federal agencies. Give 
him a problem, and he'd find the most cost-efficient solution. 
</P>
<P>
	Even when it was his own cancer.  
</P>
<P>
	Hovey, former top state budget administrator in Ohio and  
Illinois, read several books on cancer of the mouth, set up a 
computer spreadsheet of estimated expenses and figured out that his 
treatment would cost $25,000 but would have uncertain results. 
</P>
<P>
	Then he took that amount and created a fund to help children and  
young people with cancer and chronic illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Then he took his own life.  
</P>
<P>
	His final decisions ``were really just a continuation of his  
whole life and the difficult decisions you make in government,'' 
said his daughter, Kendra Hovey. ``Trying to make a decision that 
will do the most good, put the money where it will do the most 
good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A longtime smoker, he died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound at  
his home on Hilton Head Island, S.C., on Oct. 18, his daughter 
said. Hovey was 60. 
</P>
<P>
	Hovey was the architect of Ohio's income tax, instituted in  
1971, and spent two years there as state finance director. In 1973, 
he became state budget director in Illinois, and later worked as a 
budgeting consultant to several federal agencies and state 
governments. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent years, he was president of State Policy Research Inc.,  
which publishes specialized reports on state government issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Hovey ``had a fantastically well-organized analytical mind,''  
former Ohio Gov. John Gilligan said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He could take over just a haystack of papers and reports and  
accounts, all speaking a different language, and make absolutely 
good sense about them so that anybody could read and understand 
them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In keeping with his analytical view of the world, he chose not  
to have health insurance, his daughter said. 
</P>
<P>
	Once diagnosed with cancer, he consulted with his South Carolina  
doctor on treatment costs before deciding to create the charitable 
fund instead. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hovey Fund will cover costs incurred by cancer patients but  
not covered by insurance, such as transportation, lodging, child 
care and nonprescription drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Money will be available to children up to age 19 suffering  
chronic illnesses, and cancer patients 16 to 25 years old. The fund 
will accept donations to keep it going. 
</P>
<P>
	Hovey wanted the money used especially for children ``with  
hopeful outcomes,'' said Becky Cheatham, director of the Savannah, 
Ga.-based Candler Foundation, which will administer the Hovey Fund.

<HEADLINE> Figure in Loomis Heist Gets Prison </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- A woman who helped plan the $17 million  
robbery of armored car company Loomis, Fargo &AMP; Co. was sentenced 
Tuesday to nearly six years in prison and ordered to pay back more 
than $4 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelly Campbell, 29, a former company employee, entered guilty  
pleas earlier to bank larceny, money laundering and conspiracy to 
commit murder charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides her prison sentence, Campbell must undergo mental health  
and drug treatment and spend two years in a supervised release 
program. Her sentence was delayed until Jan. 1 so she could spend 
the holidays with her family. 
</P>
<P>
	Campbell helped plot the robbery of Loomis' Charlotte vault on  
Oct. 4, 1997, with David Ghantt, a Loomis supervisor who stole the 
money, and Steve Chambers, a longtime Campbell friend. 
</P>
<P>
	She later hired someone to kill Ghantt, though the murder never  
took place. 
</P>
<P>
	Ghantt was caught on videotape loading large amounts of cash  
into a truck. He became the target of a nationwide FBI manhunt and 
was arrested five months later near the Mexican resort of Cozumel. 
</P>
<P>
	The robbers went on a huge spending spree, buying a massive  
home, artworks, big-screen TVs, expensive cars, pickup trucks, 
minivans, two boats, six motorcycles and several tanning beds. 
</P>
<P>
	Ghantt was sentenced to 7 1/2 years in prison. Chambers got 11  
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-one people were charged and convicted in the robbery, one  
of the biggest heists in U.S. history.

<HEADLINE> Netscape Founder Gives to Stanford </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STANFORD, Calif. (AP) -- Netscape founder Jim Clark gave Stanford  
University $150 million to help build a cross-disciplinary science 
center that will seek cures for human diseases, the university said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Clark's is the most valuable gift given to Stanford since the  
donation by Leland Stanford that founded the university in 1891. 
Clark was a computer professor at Stanford before going into 
business for himself. 
</P>
<P>
	The new center will attempt to break down barriers between  
biologists, chemists and other academics to help them develop new 
ways to do research. It is set to open in 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	Clark's gift will pay for a new 225,000-square foot building,  
known on campus as ``Bio-X,'' to house 400 scientists and 
technicians. It will also supply equipment, endow faculty positions 
and fund graduate student fellowships. 
</P>
<P>
	Clark taught computing at Stanford from 1979 to 1982, where he  
developed a computer chip that allowed him to found computer system 
maker Silicon Graphics. 
</P>
<P>
	He went on to found Netscape and medical information systems  
maker Healtheon. His current project, myCFO.com, provides 
integrated financial management to rich individuals. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the freedom Stanford gave him helped make him rich, and  
he wanted to return the favor.

<HEADLINE> Clementes Dispute All-Century Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Roberto Clemente's family is angry he wasn't  
voted to baseball's All-Century team, and commissioner Bud Selig 
didn't rule out the possibility he could be added. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Hispanic community is in an uproar,'' Roberto Clemente Jr.  
said Tuesday night before the third game of the World Series. ``I 
hope they won't boycott baseball, because that is something I have 
some difficulty with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His brother, Luis, said there has been talk in the Hispanic  
community -- from phone calls in Puerto Rico to e-mail to the 
Roberto Clemente Web site -- of a possible boycott of MasterCard, 
the All-Century team's sponsor. Luis Clemente said his mother, 
Vera, also was surprised. The entire family spoke before the game 
in presenting this year's Roberto Clemente Award to San Diego 
outfielder Tony Gwynn. 
</P>
<P>
	``My mother's comments were she was very sad to watch all the  
other players from the same era walking around the stage before the 
game and she felt worse when he was not even mentioned.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clemente, who died in a plane crash on Dec. 31, 1972,  
accompanying relief supplies to Nicaragua following an earthquake, 
finished 10th in fan voting for outfielders. Nine outfielders were 
voted to the squad, and Stan Musial, who finished 11th in voting, 
was among the five players added by a special panel. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemente won 12 Gold Gloves and four batting titles and played  
in 12 straight All-Star games, finishing with a .317 average, 3,000 
hits and 240 home runs. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no question on my mind that he deserved to be on the  
team,'' Selig said. ``However, we opened it up for voting and 
that's the way the votes came down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He added there was a chance of expanding the team.  
</P>
<P>
	``I understand the feeling about Roberto Clemente,'' Selig said.  
``I really don't disagree with it, to be perfectly blunt about it. 
But once you start doing that, you've got some other people who 
feel they should be on it, too. So it's something that we certainly 
can talk about in the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball spokesman Rich Levin said fans and the panel, not the  
commissioner's office, picked the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you take a step back, MasterCard had no involvement with  
the selection of the original 100 players on the ballot or the 
30-man team, either the ones elected by the fans or the ones chosen 
by the panel,'' company spokesman Chris O'Neill said. 
</P>
<P>
	Filmmaker Spike Lee, standing near the Clemente brothers on the  
field, said the omission of their father was a ``mockery,'' a 
``fiasco'' and a ``boondoggle.''

<HEADLINE> Nuclear Lab Computers Limit Access </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Scientists in ``sensitive'' countries such as  
China or Iran are to be barred from connecting with Energy 
Department computers that contain even unclassified information 
beneficial to a nuclear weapons programs, department officials said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will have a policy out within the next five days that will  
greatly tighten foreign access'' to computers at the department's 
weapons laboratories, department security director Eugene Habiger 
told a House Commerce subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
	That policy is part of broad plans to tighten security at the  
nuclear weapons labs after security lapses allegedly allowed China 
to obtain nuclear secrets at a New Mexico lab. 
</P>
<P>
	Internal security investigations of the three weapons labs  
raised the prospect this summer that foreign scientists are allowed 
too much access to computer networks with unclassified information, 
Habiger said. Department officials worry that information on the 
computers, while not officially classified, could be used by 
knowledgeable scientists to aid other countries' weapons programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Some members of the House panel said they were skeptical of  
claims by Energy officials of progress toward solving security 
problems at the labs, which have been criticized for security 
lapses for years in internal reports. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope that this time what we're hearing is the truth,'' said  
Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif. ``We hope that this time there will 
be change.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some foreign scientists, including some from 25 ``sensitive''  
countries, have been cleared to access unclassified computer 
systems at the Lawrence Livermore and Los Alamos national 
laboratories, said Brad Peterson, an Energy Department computer 
security expert. One scientist from Iran, for example, has access 
to the unclassified system at Los Alamos, Peterson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The department does not disclose the 25 countries considered  
``sensitive'' except for China, Iran and Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	Energy Department officials said some of the foreign scientists  
are working on projects unrelated to nuclear weapons, such as 
research on climate change and weather patterns, while others are 
at the labs under agreements with the International Atomic Energy 
Agency and other international entities. 
</P>
<P>
	Such scientists have computer access approved and controlled by  
lab officials. The new regulations will require individual security 
plans for each scientist and force the labs to block foreigners' 
access to sensitive unclassified information or giving their 
network passwords to other people. 
</P>
<P>
	The regulations will end direct access for scientists from  
``sensitive'' countries to unclassified computer systems containing 
``national security information,'' said John Gilligan, another 
department security official. National security information, 
Gilligan said, includes data that could be used in nuclear weapons 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	The new regulations stem from computer security lapses at the  
labs found in the investigation of Wen Ho Lee, a Taiwan-born 
American scientist at Los Alamos who was suspected in the alleged 
theft of nuclear secrets by China. Lee, who was fired in March, has 
denied spying for the Chinese. 
</P>
<P>
	Energy Department investigators trying to see if computer  
hackers could gain access to the unclassified computer networks 
entered a network last year at the Sandia National Laboratory in 
New Mexico and gained access to ``a regular computer that would be 
at a researcher's desk,'' Peterson told the House panel. 
Investigators last year found at least one classified document on 
unclassified computer systems at the weapons labs but have not 
discovered a similar security breach this year, said Glenn 
Podonsky, the head of the investigation team. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials worry that a spy working inside a lab could put  
classified information on an unclassified network to be retrieved 
by foreign agents. The classified and unclassified networks are 
separate, department officials said, and the labs are working on 
ways to prevent people from moving classified information onto 
unclassified computers.

<HEADLINE> Hot Dogs Recalled for Listeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- All skinless beef frankfurters distributed  
nationwide by a New York City plant are being recalled because of 
possible listeria contamination. 
</P>
<P>
	All 16-ounce and 5-pound packages of ``Sabrett'' brand and  
``Western Beef'' brand skinless beef franks with ``EST 8854'' 
inside the USDA seal of inspection are subject to the recall 
announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	This is an expansion of an earlier recall begun two weeks ago by  
Marathon Enterprises Inc., based in East Rutherford, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	On Oct. 13, Marathon recalled one day's production, about 52,000  
pounds of franks, and voluntarily closed its facility in the Bronx 
borough of New York City the next day. A routine test by state 
inspectors had found evidence of the bacteria that causes 
listeriosis, a potentially fatal disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Subsequent testing by the company prompted it to expand the  
recall Tuesday, the Agriculture Department said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although we have no evidence of illness as a result of  
consumption of these products, we decided to err on the side of 
caution and conduct a national recall,'' said Boyd Adelman, 
Marathon's executive vice president. ``We will work closely with 
the USDA and other government agencies to ensure the health and 
safety of the public.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No illnesses have been traced to the product, USDA officials  
said. It was not known how much meat is involved in the expanded 
recall. 
</P>
<P>
	Healthy people rarely contract listeriosis, but it can cause  
fatal infections in people with weakened immune systems.

<HEADLINE> Obesity Is Soaring in America </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Americans are getting fatter, and the South --  
where meals are often finger-lickin' good and steamy summers lead 
to days of lounging inside -- is leading the way. 
</P>
<P>
	A study released Tuesday by the Centers for Disease Control and  
Prevention showed that the number of Americans considered obese -- 
defined as being more than 30 percent over their ideal body weight 
-- soared from about one in eight in 1991 to nearly one in five last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Southeast, the obesity rate jumped 67.2 percent in that  
time frame. Georgia led the nation with a 101.8 percent increase. 
</P>
<P>
	While traditional Southern cooking -- fried chicken, potato  
salad, barbecue -- is often high in fat, experts say Southerners' 
diets are now not much different from those in the rest of the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
	The more likely reason for the increase in portliness below the  
Mason-Dixon line is a lack of exercise. Southerners are less likely 
to hike, ride a bike, walk or join a health club than their 
counterparts in the rest of the nation, according to Georgia's 
Division of Public Health. 
</P>
<P>
	The lowest obesity rates were in New England and in the West,  
where people are more active. Even there, though, obesity rates are 
on the rise. 
</P>
<P>
	Some blame Southern weather, saying the summers are too hot for  
people to get outside. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they don't get out in the morning, they don't exercise,''  
said Harry DuVal, director of the University of Georgia fitness 
center. ``They go in and find air conditioning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Others, including Dr. William Dietz, one of the study's  
co-authors, blame the design of modern suburbs. Dietz points out 
that the sprawl around Atlanta keeps people trapped in their cars 
for hours, encourages them to eat greasy fast food and prevents 
them from having enough time to exercise. 
</P>
<P>
	The period measured in the study coincides with a time of rapid  
population growth around Atlanta. In 1991, Georgia had one of the 
lowest obesity rates in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	``Atlanta is not a walkable community,'' said Pam Wilson, a  
dietitian with Georgia's division of public health. ``We don't have 
sidewalks that lead anywhere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The CDC study, announced Tuesday at the AMA's annual Science  
Reporters Convention, was based on telephone surveys of more than 
100,000 participants each year between 1991 and '98. 
</P>
<P>
	Younger adults, people with some college education and Hispanics  
showed the most drastic increases. But the study found ``a steady 
increase'' in all states; in both sexes; across age groups, races 
and educational levels; and regardless of smoking status. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, the population of obese men and women in the United  
States increased from 12 percent in 1991 to 17.9 percent last year, 
according to the CDC survey, which said that figure might be 
conservative. 
</P>
<P>
	The study was to be published in Wednesday's Journal of the  
American Medical Association, along with other studies on obesity. 
</P>
<P>
	CDC Director Jeffrey P. Koplan said a national strategy is  
needed to combat obesity. 
</P>
<P>
	``In general, restoring physical activity to our daily routines  
is critical,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Compaq Beats Expectations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Compaq Computer Corp., coming off an executive  
shakeup and more than 7,000 job cuts, reported flat operating 
profits in the third quarter on Tuesday that beat analysts' 
expectations. But revenue fell 2 percent from the second quarter as 
the company lost its U.S. leadership in personal computer sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq, which is still the largest seller of PCs on a worldwide  
basis, reported net income of $140 million, or 8 cents per share, 
compared to results in the year-ago quarter of $115 million, or 7 
cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	But not counting $868 million in charges related to a  
restructuring and a $1.2 billion one-time gain on the sale of its 
AltaVista Internet portal, Compaq earned $117 million, or 7 cents a 
share in the recent quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts polled by First Call/Thomson Financial expected Compaq  
to earn 5 cents per share in the July-September period. The 
results, which were released at the close of financial markets, 
mark a return to profitability after the company's stunning $184 
million in losses last quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq reported revenue of $9.21 billion, up 5 percent from  
$8.79 billion a year ago but down slightly from $9.4 billion last 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael D. Capellas, promoted to president and chief executive  
in July following the ouster of Eckhard Pfeiffer last spring, said 
he was disappointed in revenues but encouraged by a drop in 
operating costs from the second quarter to $1.97 billion from $2.2 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``While our revenue numbers were down sequentially, we achieved  
our earnings per share target, gross margin was up and operating 
expenses were down,'' Capellas said. 
</P>
<P>
	Capellas added that he is satisfied the company, which has  
fallen behind Dell Computer Corp. in U.S. personal computer sales, 
is on track to further streamline its operations while staying 
competitive. 
</P>
<P>
	But Ashok Kumar, an analyst with U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffrey, saw  
little upside in the earnings report. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the earnings are clearly a disappointment. The  
earnings are inflated by accounting,'' Kumar said. ``The key issues 
going forward are the company has completely lost traction in the 
commercial desktop line, the company does not have a strategy for 
its service division ... and because of the deep budget cuts, 
Europe is in complete disarray. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bottom line is there's no catalyst that indicates any  
imminent turnaround.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts have faulted in part Compaq's inability to emulate the  
efficient sales model of Dell and Gateway, which sell products 
directly to customers and avoid retailers and wholesalers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Changes in the personal computer business are not just about  
sales and distribution models,'' Capellas said, adding that Compaq 
is banking on an array of upcoming computer models. ``We intend to 
drive a new generation of products, from desktops to palmtops.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq earned $237 million, or 15 cents per share, in the nine  
months ended Sept. 30. Last year at that time, the company lost 
$3.5 billion, or $2.21 cents per share, stemming from its 
acquisition of Digital. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue rose to $28.05 bill from $20.31 billion.

<HEADLINE> Gene-Testing Panel Wants Feedback </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A government-appointed panel wants to hear  
what average Americans have to say about the promise and drawbacks 
of genetic testing. 
</P>
<P>
	Gene tests that promise to predict a person's future health  
already are being sold to Americans, for hundreds of dollars 
apiece. 
</P>
<P>
	But just because a test is available does not mean that doctors  
know how best to use it -- who should get it, when, and just what 
the results mean. In addition, there is little regulation to ensure 
the accuracy of most gene tests offered today, even though mistakes 
can be life-altering. 
</P>
<P>
	An Illinois woman, for example, had her ovaries surgically  
removed before discovering the company that had told her she had a 
cancer-causing gene mutation actually had made a mistake -- she was 
not at increased risk after all. The woman says nobody ever warned 
her that a gene test, like any other medical test, can sometimes be 
wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	But gene tests are poised to revolutionize medicine, and experts  
say they could help thousands of people. So a panel of leading 
geneticists is preparing to recommend how the nation can ensure 
quality gene testing, and ways to guide doctors and consumers on 
the tests' appropriate use. 
</P>
<P>
	First, the geneticists want to see how much Americans understand  
about the state of genetic testing and what information and 
oversight they want. 
</P>
<P>
	So the panel on Tuesday decided to hold a meeting where any  
consumer can question gene experts. It will be held Jan. 27 at the 
University of Maryland in Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to try to get as close to the grassroots as  
possible,'' said Dr. Edward McCabe of the University of California, 
Los Angeles, who leads the gene-testing panel. ``We may learn that 
people are concerned about an area we completely missed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers who cannot attend the Baltimore meeting still can have  
a say. The panel's Internet site -- 
http://www.nih.gov/od/orda/sacgtdocs.htm -- is expected to post a 
transcript of the panel's latest meeting in about a week. Consumers 
can learn what recommendations are under discussion and e-mail 
comments. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists already have developed about 600 genetic tests. The  
majority are for very rare diseases in families plagued by certain 
illnesses. But more routine testing of now-healthy people to 
predict their future risks of cancer or other diseases is poised to 
explode. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the panel's priorities is determining how to explain to  
consumers the risks and benefits of each gene test. 
</P>
<P>
	Gene tests can relieve people's worry about a disease or alert  
them to take steps to prevent illness. But some tests reveal risk 
for fatal diseases that cannot be prevented. Tests also raise 
privacy concerns and can be wrong.

<HEADLINE> Court To Review Electrocutions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- The Supreme Court agreed Tuesday to  
consider the constitutionality of electrocution for the first time 
in more than a century, granting an open-ended reprieve to a man 
scheduled for execution Wednesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision by the nation's high court came nearly four months  
after a bloody execution -- the third botched electrocution in 
Florida this decade. In 1990 and 1997, flames erupted from the 
headpiece worn by the condemned killer. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida is one of only four states in the nation that require  
execution by electrocution. The only time the Supreme Court has 
considered whether electrocution can be used as a method of 
execution was in 1890, when New York became the first state to 
approve use of an electric chair. 
</P>
<P>
	The Supreme Court decision came less than an hour after the  
Florida Supreme Court granted Anthony Bryan a two-day stay to 
pursue federal appeals. That decision came down just 13 hours 
before Bryan was scheduled to go to the electric chair at 7 a.m. 
Wednesday for the 1983 murder of a Mississippi watchman. 
</P>
<P>
	Bryan's execution had been the second scheduled for this week.  
But the state Supreme Court gave condemned killer Terry Sims, 
originally set for execution Tuesday morning, a week-long reprieve 
on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Sims is condemned for the 1977 murder of an off-duty reserve  
deputy George Pfeil, who walked in on a drugstore robbery in 
central Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	The last man to die in Florida's electric chair was Allen Lee  
``Tiny'' Davis, whose bloody execution in July for the 1982 murders 
of a pregnant Jacksonville woman and her two young daughters led to 
a legal challenge of electrocution. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, the state Supreme Court upheld use of the electric  
chair in a 4-3 decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Bryan, 40, is condemned for the 1983 murder of George Wilson, a  
60-year-old watchman who was abducted in Pascagoula, Miss., and 
killed in a remote area in the western Florida Panhandle county of 
Santa Rosa.

<HEADLINE> Tour Championship on Back Burner  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Why even bother?  
</P>
<P>
	The Tour Championship is supposed to be a fantastic finish to  
the PGA Tour season. It almost always decides the money leader, 
player of the year, and winner of the Vardon Trophy for the lowest 
scoring average. 
</P>
<P>
	David Duval once referred to it as a party. The perks for the  
top 30 on the money list include the chance to win $900,000 with a 
small field to beat. 
</P>
<P>
	There is no suspense this year. Tiger Woods is a lock to win  
every award that matters. 
</P>
<P>
	There is no celebration at Champions Golf Club, not without the  
man whom Tom Kite referred to as the ``life of the party.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For one day this week, there will be no Tour Championship. The  
PGA Tour decided to cancel competition on Friday because of the 
memorial service in Orlando, Fla., for Payne Stewart, the U.S. Open 
champion who was among those killed in a freak plane crash Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps there should be no Tour Championship at all. The way 22  
players carried on like zombies, perhaps the tour should just divvy 
up the $5 million and call it a week. 
</P>
<P>
	Flowers were placed in the parking spot with Stewart's name on  
it. Tour officials are making black ribbons for everyone to wear. 
</P>
<P>
	Phil Mickelson was on the driving range late Tuesday afternoon  
when he stopped to watch a highlight reel of Stewart that was shown 
on the Jumbotron. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't really thought about the tournament this week,''  
Mickelson said. Until Monday, he was pointing toward the Tour 
Championship as one of two last chances to keep alive his streak of 
winning at least once on tour every year since 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	``As far as golf is concerned, it really takes a seat on the  
back burner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	David Duval won the Tour Championship at Champions two years  
ago. What would another victory mean this week? 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know,'' he said. ``I really don't know. The feelings  
will probably not be as great as they might have been.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He may find out.  
</P>
<P>
	The Tour Championship will start with 27 holes on Thursday, the  
first time a score over 100 could be enough to lead after the first 
``round.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No golf on Friday for those who want to attend the Stewart's  
memorial service in Orlando, Fla. Then 27 holes on Saturday, 
followed by some degree of normalcy -- an 18-hole final round -- on 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Someone will hold the trophy and cash the check. And someone's  
joy will be tempered by the thought of Stewart -- a great 
ambassador, a great friend, a great player who lost his life with 
shocking suddenness. 
</P>
<P>
	This is not the first time tragedy has interrupted a game.  
</P>
<P>
	Pete Rozelle lamented years later that he didn't cancel NFL  
games on the Sunday after John F. Kennedy was assassinated. Avery 
Brundage, the head of the IOC, was harshly criticized for insisting 
that the 1972 Olympics in Munich continue after the deadly 
terrorist attack on Israeli athletes and coaches in the Olympic 
village. 
</P>
<P>
	The NCAA took it on the chin for playing the 1981 championship  
basketball game after President Reagan had been shot that day in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether Stewart's death is crushing enough to cancel a  
tournament -- it usually takes a World War for that to happen in 
golf -- is debatable. 
</P>
<P>
	But the look on the faces of 22 players Tuesday and the  
library-like setting on the golf course made it clear that golf, 
even at this level, was nothing more than hitting a little white 
ball, finding it, and hitting it again. 
</P>
<P>
	``I imagine everybody will be playing and doing the best they  
can,'' Duval said. ``But I don't know how spectacular the golf will 
be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps the mood will change by the time the first ball is  
struck Thursday morning, a short time after a brief service for 
Stewart on the first tee. 
</P>
<P>
	After all, the pro-am was canceled on Tuesday and no one had to  
show. Instead, all but seven players began their own rehabilitation 
by getting back inside the ropes, trying to get their minds back on 
golf. 
</P>
<P>
	Commissioner Tim Finchem has tried to create a time to play and  
a time to pay respects, giving the players a rare Friday off in 
Houston and in Mississippi, where the Southern Farm Bureau Classic 
will wrap up on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Some have suggested a PGA Tour award in Stewart's honor, maybe  
naming the Tour Championship trophy after him. 
</P>
<P>
	Now that the game is on, perhaps the best way to honor Stewart  
is to play with the same tenacity that carried him to two U.S. Open 
titles. 
</P>
<P>
	Otherwise, it's not worth playing. Stewart would be the first to  
tell them that.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Deemed Not Ready for Quakes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Scientists say the United States' ability to  
rapidly respond to major earthquakes in cities is hindered by an 
antiquated network of seismic instruments. 
</P>
<P>
	In contrast, a new digital seismic network in Taiwan alerted  
officials to the scope of its magnitude 7.2 earthquake on September 
21 while the ground was still shaking. 
</P>
<P>
	Geologists met in Denver Tuesday for the annual convention of  
the Geological Society of America said Southern California is 
beginning to install digital monitoring equipment along some of the 
most notorious quake-prone faults that crisscross the region's 
underbelly. 
</P>
<P>
	The upgrade was prompted by the Northridge earthquake in 1994  
that killed 57 people and caused more than $20 billion in damage. 
</P>
<P>
	But similar monitors are not yet being installed around San  
Francisco, where geologists predict a 70 percent chance of a major 
earthquake occurring within the next 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, most of the country is monitored by arrays of  
mechanical monitors that read a variety of seismic waves generated 
by earthquakes. The information is relayed to computers for 
analysis, but the digital systems use computerized sensors that are 
faster and more accurate. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists said communities typically wait until after a natural  
disaster -- what they describe as the ``teaching moment'' -- to make 
improvements. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it wasn't for the Northridge earthquake, Los Angeles  
probably wouldn't have any of the technology in place,'' said Mary 
Lou Zoback, chief scientist of the Western Earthquake Hazards Team 
for the U.S. Geological Survey. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress is considering authorizing $170 million to install a  
digital network in quake-prone cities across the United States, 
including the Pacific Northwest and the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure has been approved by the House of Representatives.  
Even if it wins Senate support, the entire network would not be in 
place for another five years or more, scientists said. 
</P>
<P>
	Following the 1995 earthquake in Kobe, Japan that killed 6,000  
and caused $100 billion in damage, Japan and Taiwan installed dense 
arrays of digital seismic monitors in their countries. 
</P>
<P>
	The monitors cannot prevent damage by themselves, but provide  
public safety officials with a nearly-instant reports of where an 
earthquake is most severe, or if less-severe shaking is occurring 
in an unstable area prone of landslides.

<HEADLINE> Rookie Survives Linebacker Attrition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FOXBORO, Mass. (AP) -- One by one, the Patriots' battered  
linebackers left the locker room. 
</P>
<P>
	Ted Johnson's left elbow was heavily taped. Marty Moore limped  
on a sprained knee. Vernon Crawford's right leg was encased in a 
plastic cast. Tedy Bruschi and Bernard Russ walked on tender knees 
that kept them out of the last two games. 
</P>
<P>
	This never happened at Ohio State.  
</P>
<P>
	``In college, you dress about 15 linebackers,'' Andy Katzenmoyer  
said. ``We've got to see how things happen the next couple of 
days.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Katzenmoyer and Chris Slade are the survivors, New England's  
only two healthy linebackers after Moore and Crawford sprained 
their knees against Denver. Johnson, Bruschi and Russ didn't even 
suit up for the game. 
</P>
<P>
	So the call went out for reinforcements.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have any idea how it's going to work out,'' Patriots  
coach Pete Carroll said before the team tried out five linebackers 
Tuesday but signed none of them. None were well known -- Alan 
Campos, Steve Russ, Kinnon Tatum, Jeff Kopp and Tyrus McCloud. 
</P>
<P>
	Has anyone seen Dick Butkus?  
</P>
<P>
	For now, Katzenmoyer will have to do, and he's doing fine.  
</P>
<P>
	After a controversial final season at Ohio State, the  
first-round draft pick wasn't expected to start for New England. 
But after Johnson ruptured his left biceps tendon in preseason, 
Katzenmoyer has started all seven games at middle linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
	``I learn better by doing, not by just watching,'' he said.  
``The more and more I see, the better off I'll be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two Sundays ago, he returned an interception 57 yards for a  
touchdown in a 31-30 loss to Miami. In last Sunday's 24-23 win over 
Denver, Katzenmoyer tied for second on the team with nine tackles. 
</P>
<P>
	He's exceeded expectations, but not necessarily his own.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not happy with the way I'm playing because I'm not playing  
perfectly,'' Katzenmoyer said. ``Until I play that perfect game, 
I'm not going to be satisfied with anything I do and, in all 
honesty, that's never going to happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In college, he was arrested twice on alcohol-related charges and  
had to pass three courses -- AIDS awareness, golf and music -- in the 
summer of 1998 to be eligible for his junior season. 
</P>
<P>
	But his play fell off after an outstanding freshman season and a  
sophomore campaign in which he won the Butkus Award as the nation's 
top college linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
	The Patriots took him with the 28th overall draft choice, later  
than he was expected to go. 
</P>
<P>
	Now he's a key to a defense that was forced to use safeties  
Larry Whigham and Lawyer Milloy at linebacker last Sunday after 
Moore left in the second quarter and Crawford was hurt in the 
third. 
</P>
<P>
	``My linebacker days are long gone,'' Whigham said, ``but if the  
challenge arises, I'll be back in there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moore and Crawford are doubtful for Sunday's game at Arizona,  
although Bruschi is confident he'll be back. 
</P>
<P>
	Katzenmoyer still has plenty to learn about playing linebacker  
in the NFL and doesn't expect to feel more pressure to perform as 
one of just two healthy linebackers. 
</P>
<P>
	Crawford has started only one game since being drafted by the  
Patriots in 1997 and finally got his chance to play a lot after 
Moore was injured. Then he was hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if Bruschi comes back, the Patriots would have just three  
experienced linebackers available Sunday. What if a defensive back 
is forced to play that spot again? Would Katzenmoyer feel obligated 
to cover more ground and help him out? 
</P>
<P>
	``They're professional athletes just like I am,'' he said.  
``It's their job to step up and fill in where needed, like I did.''

<HEADLINE> Minnesota Bans Team From Postseason </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Minnesota will hold its men's basketball team  
out of postseason play for one year because of alleged academic 
cheating in the program, school president Mark Yudof said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The university also is placing the program on probation for an  
unspecified length of time, Yudof said. That will mean higher 
levels of reporting to the NCAA such as periodic self-studies and 
compliance checks, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	An investigation into the men's basketball program began in  
March after former tutor Jan Gangelhoff claimed she did more than 
400 pieces of course work for at least 20 basketball players from 
1993 to 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation has since widened to include accusations of  
improper payments and travel irregularities, and alleged sexual and 
other misconduct in the men's athletics department. 
</P>
<P>
	Yudof said the university and the NCAA may impose more sanctions  
after the final university report is completed, probably by Nov. 
10. The report is expected to be made public about 10 days later. 
</P>
<P>
	Yudof said he realized some current basketball team members may  
feel the sanctions are unfair, but said, ``We must demonstrate good 
faith and take meaningful action to repair the damage that has been 
done by others.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In response to a question about the difficulty of self-imposing  
sanctions, Yudof called it ``the right thing to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The NCAA has to worry about deterrents. I have to worry about  
deterrents in the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The postseason ban includes the NCAA and NIT but not the Big Ten  
tournament, Yudof said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gangelhoff, the woman who sparked the investigation, left her  
job at a casino in Danbury, Wis., to listen to the university's 
news conference on her car radio. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's just the beginning,'' Gangelhoff said.  
``President Yudof must have enough information to realize these two 
things (sanctions) were going to happen regardless of whether or 
not he has the complete report in hand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NCAA spokeswoman Jane Jankowski said the organization would not  
comment specifically on the sanctions. But she said it is 
appropriate and common for schools to come up with their own 
punishments. 
</P>
<P>
	``Universities do frequently hand down their own penalties, and  
our (investigating) committee considers that and can adopt those 
sanctions, as well as add other penalties,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Clem Haskins resigned under pressure in June and accepted  
a $1.5 million buyout of his contract. He has said he had no 
knowledge of any academic cheating in the basketball program. 
</P>
<P>
	Dan Monson of Gonzaga was hired to replace Haskins.  
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether anyone may lose their job because of the  
investigation, Yudof said maybe. ``I don't want to presage what 
might come out in the report,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	One reason to come out with sanctions now was to improve team  
morale, Yudof said. Monson agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the staff and our team, it's the beginning of the end,''  
Monson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Monson said he would be open with prospective players about the  
sanctions, which he and Yudof acknowledged would hurt recruiting. 
However, if they end after one year, they may not have as great an 
impact, Monson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Yudof said the NCAA is supposed to have an infraction hearing  
next spring and could issue sanctions then or wait until the fall.

<HEADLINE> Pippen To Miss Exhibition Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Precautionary X-rays of Scottie Pippen's  
injured left index finger revealed no fracture, but the Portland 
Trail Blazers forward is wearing a splint and will miss the last 
two exhibition games. 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen injured the finger in Monday night's victory over the Los  
Angeles Lakers at Albuquerque, N.M. 
</P>
<P>
	The team said Tuesday the injury is listed as a sprain of the  
ligaments on the medial and lateral side of the finger. 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen will sit out Thursday's game against Phoenix and Friday's  
game at Sacramento. The Trail Blazers, who are 6-0 in the 
preseason, said he will be ready for the season opener at Vancouver 
on Nov. 2.

<HEADLINE> Indictment in Black College Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- A federal grand jury returned an  
indictment Tuesday charging a white man with setting off bombs at a 
mostly black college. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawrence M. Lombardi is accused of two counts of setting off  
pipe bombs at Florida A&AMP;M University and two counts of possession 
of a pipe bomb during the commission of a crime. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither explosion injured anyone and the damage was slight. But  
a pall of fear settled on the 12,000-student campus, particularly 
after the second explosion Sept. 22. 
</P>
<P>
	Both explosions were accompanied by racist phone calls to a  
television station and the last one included a warning that the two 
blasts were ``just the beginning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lombardi, a 41-year-old former funeral embalmer, had been in  
federal custody since he was arrested Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	The indictment as released by U.S. Attorney Michael Patterson  
without comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Lombardi's lawyer, Tim Jansen, has said his client is innocent  
and stunned by the charges. Jansen didn't return a phone call after 
business hours Tuesday seeking comment.

<HEADLINE> Studies: Obesity on the Rise in US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Obesity is a U.S. epidemic that has surged in  
the past decade and now affects nearly one in five adults, killing 
some 300,000 a year, a collection of new studies suggest. 
</P>
<P>
	The studies, which will be published in Wednesday's Journal of  
the American Medical Association, are the latest to spread the 
warning that Americans are getting fatter -- and that fat kills. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obesity is a major cause of mortality in the United States,''  
concludes one of the surveys. 
</P>
<P>
	One study by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  
showed that the number of Americans considered obese -- defined as 
being more than 30 percent over their ideal body weight -- soared 
from about one in eight in 1991 to nearly one in five last year. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1991, four out of 45 participating states had obesity rates  
of 15 percent or higher, while the figure for 1998 was 37 states, 
according to the study. 
</P>
<P>
	That data, which was to be announced today at the AMA's annual  
Science Reporters Convention, was based on telephone surveys of 
more than 100,000 participants each year between 1991-98. 
</P>
<P>
	Younger adults, people with some college education and Hispanics  
showed the most drastic increases, but ``a steady increase was 
observed in all states; in both sexes; across age groups, races, 
educational levels; and occurred regardless of smoking status,'' 
the study found. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, the population of obese men and women increased from 12  
percent in 1991 to 17.9 percent last year, according to the CDC 
survey, which said that figure might be conservative. 
</P>
<P>
	Other recent research has found that more than 50 percent of  
Americans are overweight and 22 percent are obese, even though 
weight-loss products and services are a $33 billion-a-year 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Being overweight has been strongly associated with greater risk  
of certain illnesses, including heart disease, high cholesterol and 
blood pressure, diabetes, stroke and some cancers. 
</P>
<P>
	A recent study in the New England Journal of Medicine of more  
than 1 million Americans concluded that obese people run a 
significant risk of dying early, even if they don't smoke and are 
otherwise healthy. 
</P>
<P>
	Another study in this week's JAMA issue on obesity -- all of the  
studies involved Americans at least the age of 18 -- attributed an 
estimated average of about 280,000 deaths a year to being 
overweight, but said the figure could be more than 374,000 when the 
numbers are calculated differently. 
</P>
<P>
	The figures were adjusted for sex, age and whether the subjects  
smoked but did not factor in chronic disease or family histories 
that might indicate a predisposition to an illness. 
</P>
<P>
	An editorial accompanying the obesity issue of JAMA calls for  
developing a comprehensive national strategy to prevent obesity. 
</P>
<P>
	Growth in the marketing of fast food and snack food, as well as  
lack of exercise, are among the reasons Americans are taking in 
more calories than they burn, the editorial concluded. 
</P>
<P>
	``Children watch more television daily, physical education has  
been markedly reduced in our schools, many neighborhoods lack 
sidewalks for safe walking, the workplace has become increasingly 
automated, household chores are assisted by labor-saving machinery, 
and walking or bicycling has been replaced by automobile travel,'' 
the editorial said.

<HEADLINE> Bradley for Campaign Finance Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLAREMONT, N.H. (AP) -- Granny D interrupted her cross-country  
walk Tuesday to gather Bill Bradley's pledge to make campaign 
finance reform a top priority. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's one you can count on,'' the Democratic presidential  
candidate told 89-year-old Doris Haddock, who began her walk in 
January to counter polls that say Americans don't consider campaign 
finance reform important. 
</P>
<P>
	``Each day of my walk I have met Americans frustrated to tears --  
real tears -- over the condition of our democracy,'' said the woman 
nicknamed Granny D. ``We can solve this problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In June 1995, during a joint appearance in Claremont, President  
Clinton and Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich set aside their 
political differences and agreed to a suggestion at a town forum 
that they appoint a bipartisan commission to recommend ways to 
reform campaign financing. The commission never met. 
</P>
<P>
	At a rally Tuesday, Bradley promised Haddock and about 150  
supporters he would make campaign finance reform a top priority. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's have a handshake on that!'' Haddock's son Jim shouted  
from the back of the church-turned conference center. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley obliged. ``That'll be one you can count on,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Haddock, from Dublin, N.H., has completed about 2,200 miles of  
her planned 3,300-mile -- she flew in from Kentucky -- and intends to 
finish in Washington on Jan. 24, her 90th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
	Her goals are threefold: a ban on ``soft money'' donations,  
public financing of campaigns and free advertising air time for 
candidates. The Senate last week killed a bill that would have 
accomplished the first goal, but Haddock said she is not 
discouraged. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Senate didn't want to take their medicine last week, so  
we'll have to make them take that pill when they come home for 
re-election,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley agreed with each of her objectives. Voters may list  
priorities such as health care and good jobs ahead of campaign 
finance reform, he said, but powerful special interest groups make 
improving both more difficult. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to realize how it's related to achieving all of those  
things,'' he said. ``If Granny D can walk across America, we ought 
to be able to have a clean campaign financing system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said meaningful reform depends on three things: a grassroots  
movement to convince lawmakers to change the system, help from 
business, religious and academic leaders and a president who 
``realizes this issue is key to so many other issues.''

<HEADLINE> Former Head of Greyhound Corp. Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Gerald H. Trautman, the retired head of The  
Greyhound Corp., the predecessor of current-day convention and 
travel services company Viad Corp., died of natural causes Monday. 
He was 87. 
</P>
<P>
	Trautman became president of Greyhound in 1966. He shepherded  
the company's move from Chicago to Phoenix, retiring in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
	During his tenure, Greyhound purchased Armour/Dial, a company  
twice its size. He directed 150 companies and 57,000 employees 
during his time at the helm. 
</P>
<P>
	Viad is now a $2.3 billion corporation with 19,800 employees  
after separating from its consumer products division Dial Corp. in 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jerry was a visionary leader who created one of the largest  
and most successful companies of the '70s, when conglomerates were 
in vogue,'' said John Teets, former chairman of Greyhound, Dial and 
Viad. 
</P>
<P>
	Trautman is survived by his wife, Barbara, and six sons.

<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Forty years after he began performing at a  
downtown lounge as a teen-age crooner, Wayne Newton has signed what 
he says is the biggest contract of his career. 
</P>
<P>
	The 10-year deal calls for him to perform 40 weeks a year, six  
nights a week, at the Stardust hotel-casino on the Las Vegas Strip. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal was announced Tuesday by Newton and William Boyd,  
chairman and chief executive officer of Boyd Gaming Corporation, 
the Stardust's parent corporation. 
</P>
<P>
	``To have 'the King of Las Vegas' as our headliner is an  
incredible way to bring the Stardust into the 21st century,'' Boyd 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 920-seat showroom which currently hosts the ``Enter the  
Night'' production will be renamed the Wayne Newton Theatre when he 
begins his regular run Jan. 24, 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Newton declined to reveal terms of the contract, citing a  
nondisclosure agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can tell you that if you put all my contracts together over  
the years, it wouldn't equal this,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Pitt's Ketchen Truly a Veteran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Most college football players discover their  
gift for athletics at an early age, in a Pop Warner league, a 
sandlot or a spectator-free junior high playing field. 
</P>
<P>
	Kenney Ketchen found his three years ago on, of all places, a  
Navy aircraft carrier. 
</P>
<P>
	At Pitt, his teammates salute him and refer to him as a veteran  
wide receiver, a title that seems to be an oxymoron considering his 
lack of exposure to organized football until his mid-20s. 
</P>
<P>
	But Ketchen truly is a veteran, serving six years in the U.S.  
Navy as an operations specialist who helped supervise the radar and 
navigation systems of the USS Kittyhawk and Independence during the 
Gulf War. 
</P>
<P>
	No wonder that Ketchen, who at 27 is far older and has far more  
life experiences than most college players, seems rather nonplussed 
when he fights off multiple defenders for a pass. Just as he will 
Saturday against No. 3 Virginia Tech. 
</P>
<P>
	Considering he once was responsible for the safe return of  
combat planes, at all hours of the day and night and in varying 
weather conditions, it takes more than an agitating cornerback to 
rattle him. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't really compare the two, football and the military,  
one's a game and one isn't,'' he said during one of the few free 
minutes he has in a typically crowded day. ``But you have to 
prepare, everything is preparation, and that is similar. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the military, before a war, you train for the moment and  
you're combat ready. It's the same thing in preseason football 
camp, you're just preparing, preparing, preparing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But nothing in Ketchen's teen years prepared him for the  
circuitous, 'round-the-world route from his Mount Vernon, N.Y., 
home to Pitt Stadium. He played baseball and basketball in high 
school, and wanted to play baseball professionally, but never got 
the chance. On the advice of his grandfather, he signed up for the 
Navy on the day he graduated. 
</P>
<P>
	He was stationed initially in Virginia, then went to sea for  
several years, stopping in faraway ports such as Thailand and 
Japan. There, some sailors formed an organized football league, 
playing opposing fleets in night games watched by thousands of the 
local residents. 
</P>
<P>
	Ketchen was fast and had a good set of hands, and the first time  
he caught a touchdown pass, he thought, ``This feels right, it just 
feels right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It felt right again after he was discharged and enrolled in  
Chaffey College in California. He met a few football players at a 
party and told them of his five-game military experience, and they 
encouraged him to try out. 
</P>
<P>
	Not only did he make the team, he caught seven passes for more  
than 100 yards and a touchdown in his first junior college game. 
His military-acquired discipline made him a team leader, and he 
soon attracted the eye of Pitt recruiters who were combing 
California's junior colleges. 
</P>
<P>
	He was a quick study at Pitt, catching 11 passes for 134 yards  
and a touchdown in a backup role last season. This year, the 
6-foot-1, 200-pound senior has five receptions for 55 yards -- and, 
more importantly, the unquestioned respect of his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think there is a player on this team who doesn't look  
up to him,'' wide receiver Latef Grim said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ketchen appreciates the attention his unusual background draws,  
but prefers to be known as a football player and not a curiosity. 
He will return next year to finish up his degree in social science, 
and hopes to work with inner city children. 
</P>
<P>
	He already has his own child, son Khalid, who was born in  
January and lives in Pittsburgh with Ketchen and his girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just want to talk with kids, help guide them, be a positive  
influence at a time when they could easily be led astray,'' Ketchen 
said.

<HEADLINE> NTSB Begins Stewart Crash Inquiry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                         *By JOHN MacDONALD    	
</P>
<P>
                      *Associated Press Writer    	
</P>
<P>
	MINA, S.D. (AP) -- Investigators began gathering the remains of  
golfer Payne Stewart and five others from a 10-foot-deep crater in 
a soggy pasture Tuesday, hoping to determine whether a sudden loss 
in cabin pressure doomed their Learjet. 
</P>
<P>
	Dressed in heavy overalls against a cold wind, members of the  
National Transportation Safety Board spent all day at the South 
Dakota crash site, picking through the wreckage not only for the 
victims but for identifiable pieces of the shattered aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators cautioned that there will be no quick explanation  
for why no one was conscious at the controls for four hours Monday, 
when the jet flew 1,400 miles across the country before running out 
of fuel and slamming nose-first into the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	The plane had no flight data recorder that could yield  
information on the aircraft and its performance. 
</P>
<P>
	It had a cockpit voice recorder, but it consisted of a 30-minute  
loop that usually records over itself. And Stewart and the others 
on the plane presumably were already unconscious or dead by the 
last half-hour of the flight. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the plane's debris is embedded in mud and soil within a  
10-foot-deep, 30-foot-wide crater, said Bob Francis, vice chairman 
of the National Transportation Safety Board. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks like the aircraft was pretty much vertical when it  
hit the ground,'' he said. ``The ground is soft, and it went in 
fairly deep. It's going to be a challenge, with the wreckage and 
sorting out what's there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators were sending tissue samples from the victims to a  
medical examiner's lab to test for such substances as carbon 
monoxide. 
</P>
<P>
	But Brad Randall, a state medical examiner, said toxicology  
tests may be worthless in attempting to verify one possible theory 
for the accident -- that the victims suffered oxygen deprivation 
because of a sudden decompression of the aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
	Planes that fly above 12,000 feet are pressurized because the  
air does not contain enough oxygen for people to breathe 
comfortably. If a plane loses pressure at high altitude, those 
aboard could slowly lose consciousness or, if an aircraft broke a 
door or window seal, perish in seconds from lack of oxygen. 
</P>
<P>
	If a plane loses cabin pressure, pilots are supposed to put on  
oxygen masks and quickly descend to 12,000 feet or lower. There was 
no evidence suggesting the pilots of Stewart's jet made any effort 
do to do, but Francis declined to speculate what that could mean. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, air traffic controllers were unable to raise anyone  
aboard the plane by radio soon after it took off from Orlando, Fla. 
Fighter pilots who chased down the plane were unable to see into 
the Learjet because its windows were frosted over, indicating the 
temperature inside was well below freezing. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said the air temperature at the altitude the jet was  
flying would have been minus 70 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
	Together, the evidence raised suspicions that the plane had  
experienced a catastrophic loss of cabin pressure. 
</P>
<P>
	Four years ago, federal regulators ordered that valves that  
regulate pressure on Learjets be replaced to ``prevent rapid 
decompression of the airplane.'' The Federal Aviation 
Administration gave owners 18 months to comply. It is unclear 
whether the work was performed on Stewart's plane. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA also limited planes to an altitude of 41,000 feet until  
the valves were placed because of the possibility they could fail. 
</P>
<P>
	In the plane's last radio transmission above Gainesville, Fla.,  
the pilot was instructed to climb to 39,000 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	The 23-year-old, eight-passenger plane had logged more than  
10,000 hours of flight time but had no history of serious 
mechanical problems, according to the FAA. 
</P>
<P>
	The twin-engine jet was operated by Sunjet Aviation Inc. Company  
President James Watkins said the plane had been inspected before it 
took off and four other times in the past week. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart, 42, with his knickers and tam-o'-shanter hat, was one  
of the world's most recognizable golfers. He won 18 tournaments, 
including two U.S. Open titles. He also was part of the team that 
helped the United States stage a historic comeback to beat Europe 
last month for the Ryder Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart and his wife, Tracey, had two children, ages 10 and 13.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's an irreplaceable guy,'' fellow golfer Duffy Waldorf said.  
``I think of Payne Stewart and there's a guy that's going to be 
like Jack Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer, a guy you want around all 
those years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also killed were Stewart's agents, Robert Fraley and Van Ardan,  
and the two pilots, Michael Kling, 43, and Stephanie Bellegarrigue, 
27. Bruce Borland, 40, one of Nicklaus' golf course designers, was 
also believed to have been on the plane.

<P>
	HELENA, Mont. (AP) -- Hoyt Axton, a folksy baritone, songwriter  
and actor who wrote Three Dog Night's No. 1 hit ``Joy to the 
World'' and songs that were performed by artists from Elvis Presley 
to Ringo Starr, died Tuesday after suffering a heart attack two 
weeks ago and another during surgery. He was 61. 
</P>
<P>
	Axton's mother, Mae Boren Axton, had her own spot in popular  
culture history as the co-author of Presley's ``Heartbreak Hotel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Three Dog Night's recording of his novelty ``Joy to the World''  
(``Jeremiah was a bullfrog ...'') was on top of the charts for six 
straight weeks in 1971, making it the top hit of the year. Axton 
pitched the song to group members when he was their opening act in 
1969-70. He also wrote ``Never Been to Spain'' for the band, a song 
also recorded by Presley. 
</P>
<P>
	Axton's own singing hits include ``Boney Fingers'' (``Work your  
fingers to the bone, what do you get? Boney fingers'') and ``When 
the Morning Comes.'' 
</P>

	LONDON (AP) -- Michael Baring, a leading member of the British  
banking dynasty brought down by a rogue trader in 1995, died Oct. 
15, according to the ING Group, which took over the bankrupt 
Barings bank. He was 50. 
</P>
<P>
	News reports said he suffered a heart attack.  
</P>
<P>
	Baring played a key role in trying to steady nerves when a  
Singapore-based British trader, Nick Leeson, brought down the bank 
with bad bets on financial markets. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, Baring -- great-great-grandson of Sir Francis  
Baring, who founded the banking dynasty in the 18th century -- was 
head of international marketing at the bank. 
</P>
<P>
	He transferred to ING when the Dutch group bought the bank for  
$1.60 and took over its debts of some $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	His most recent appointment was head of a division responsible  
for ING Barings' relationships with clients and partners worldwide.

	He began work at Barings in a job in the mailroom, before  
becoming a trader.

	GUATEMALA CITY (AP) -- Guatemalan former vice president Arturo  
Herbruger Asturias, founder of an organization that oversaw the 
country's return to democracy after a failed coup, died Monday. He 
was 87 and had diabetes and bronchial pneumonia. 
</P>
<P>
	Herbruger established the Supreme Electoral Tribunal in 1983,  
the organization that presided over elections for the National 
Constitutional Assembly in 1984 and presidential elections in 1985 
and 1990. He headed the tribunal until 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	After the failure of an attempted coup on May 25, 1993, against  
then-President Jorge Serrano Elias, the Congress designated Ramiro 
de Leon Carpio as president and Herbruger as vice president, to 
serve until January 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time of his death, Herbruger was serving as a  
representative of the Central American Parliament, made up of 120 
representatives from Guatemala, Honduras, Panama, Nicaragua, El 
Salvador and the Dominican Republic.

of Appeals judge who once acted as special counsel in impeachment 
proceedings against a former attorney general, died Monday night in 
a traffic accident. He was 51. 
</P>
<P>
	He died after his pickup truck collided nearly head on with  
another pickup truck on U.S. Highway 281, just south of Interstate 
80. 
</P>
<P>
	Mues, who joined the appeals court in 1994, was appointed  
special counsel for the state in the impeachment proceedings 
against then-Attorney General Paul Douglas. 
</P>
<P>
	Douglas was impeached by the Legislature in 1984, partly over  
his conduct in office and personal dealings with a former officer 
of the failed Commonwealth Savings Co. in Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
	Douglas was acquitted by the state Supreme Court before being  
convicted of perjury by a county court jury in Lincoln on Dec. 14, 
1984. He resigned 12 days later, only to see his perjury conviction 
later overturned by the state Supreme Court.

<HEADLINE> Budget Veto Secured US Vote in UN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- U.S. Ambassador Richard Holbrooke said  
Tuesday President Clinton was right to veto a budget bill that 
didn't pay U.S. dues to the United Nations, leaving the country 
without a vote in the U.N. General Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
	He called on Congress to come up with the money to pay a  
substantial chunk of U.S. arrears to the world body, saying 
national security interests were at stake. He said the country 
could lose its forum for debating important global issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to band together now on a bipartisan basis to push  
back the forces of that small group of people who want to destroy 
United States national security interests and simultaneously do 
immeasurable damage to the United Nations,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	According to U.N. figures, the United States is currently $1.8  
billion in arrears and must pay $350 million by Dec. 31 to keep its 
seat in the U.N. General Assembly. Its vote in the Security Council 
is secured. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton on Monday night vetoed a $39 billion bill financing the  
departments of Commerce, Justice and State, saying it would among 
other things ``threaten America's ability to lead in the world by 
failing to meet our obligation to pay our dues and our debts to the 
United Nations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said the bill included adequate funds to pay the annual  
U.S. contribution to the regular U.N. budget -- but he said the 
payment schedule was changed so funds wouldn't be authorized in 
time to avoid losing the U.S. seat. This, he said, was 
``unacceptable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Great nations meet their responsibilities, and I am determined  
that we will meet ours,'' the president said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also complained that the bill included only $200 million  
of the $485 million the administration sought to meet the U.S. 
share of anticipated U.N. peacekeeping obligations in East Timor, 
Sierra Leone, Congo and Ethiopia-Eritrea. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past week, the United States has supported U.N. Security  
Council resolutions authorizing deployment of 6,000 U.N. 
peacekeepers to Sierra Leone and more than 9,000 to East Timor. 
</P>
<P>
	Holbrooke has been spending at least two days a week in  
Washington lobbying members of Congress and said he is determined 
to get the United States to pay at least dlrs 900 million in U.N. 
arrears. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress has held up payment of U.S. arrears for years,  
demanding that the United Nations streamline its organization and 
institute a no-growth budget. Legislation that would have paid off 
the bulk of the bills was vetoed last year by Clinton because it 
contained unrelated restrictions on U.S. spending for overseas 
family planning organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	The vast majority of congressmen and senators want the United  
States to pay its dues, he said, ``and we are working with them to 
fashion a bipartisan solution in the interests of national 
security.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe this is fixable in the dramatic end-game of the  
budget process which has now begun,'' Holbrooke said.

<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A Chinese national who pleaded guilty to a  
charge of hostage-taking involving a Taiwanese businessman's son 
was sentenced to more than 10 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Xu Lin Wang, 27, was sentenced Monday to federal prison for his  
role in kidnapping a 17-year-old boy from his home in suburban San 
Marino on Dec. 15. 
</P>
<P>
	Two days after the boy was abducted, co-conspirators in China  
demanded ransom from Kuan Nan ``Johnny'' Chen's father, Fu Shun 
Chen, a developer with homes and businesses here and in Taiwan. The 
kidnappers unsuccessfully attempted to collect $1.5 million ransom. 
</P>
<P>
	Chinese authorities bargained with the kidnappers to buy time so  
U.S. investigators could follow clues that led to the Temple City 
home where the boy was chained to a bed for more than two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	FBI agents freed the youth and arrested the two men as $500,000  
in ransom was exchanging hands in the Chinese province of Fujian.

<HEADLINE> Lords Vote To End Heredity Rule </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Members of the House of Lords voted late Tuesday  
to end the right of hereditary peers to sit and vote in Britain's 
upper chamber of Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill was approved by the body 221-81 shortly before midnight  
after hours of emotional debate. It marked one of the final stages 
of Prime Minister Tony Blair's efforts to remove hereditary peers 
from the chamber. 
</P>
<P>
	``A long chapter of history is being closed tonight,'' said Lord  
Strathclyde, an opposition Conservative Party leader in Lords who 
urged members to abstain from voting. 
</P>
<P>
	Britain's opposition Conservative Party, which most of the  
bluebloods in the chamber support, debated until the last minute 
about their lordships having to vote themselves out of existence. 
</P>
<P>
	But if they had rejected the bill, Blair could have presented it  
again in the Labor-dominated House of Commons in the new 
parliamentary session starting Nov. 17. The Lords cannot twice 
reject a bill passed by the Commons. 
</P>
<P>
	Lords leader Baroness Jay said it was ``time to say thank you  
and goodbye'' to the hereditary peers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blair government has not decided on the composition of a new  
House of Lords, which is expected to be partly appointed and partly 
elected. Critics charge that the new chamber will be a gathering of 
governing party timeservers and cronies of the prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
	The hereditary peers who win a temporary reprieve are being  
selected by ballots among their fellow aristocrats. Final results 
will be announced Nov. 5. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill ends the 800-year right of hereditary peers to be  
lawmakers. They retain their titles and estates. 
</P>
<P>
	At one point during the debate Tuesday, a duke's son jumped on  
the speaker's historic seat in the House of Lords declaring 
``treason.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Behind this bill for Lords' reform lies a hidden agenda which  
is treason,'' the Earl of Burford said before leaping on the 
Woolsack, a square seat of stuffed wool that has been reserved for 
speakers since the 14th century. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy Speaker Lord Boston, who was perched on the Woolsack,  
ducked out of the way as ushers grabbed and ousted the 34-year-old 
earl, heir to the 14th Duke of St. Albans. 
</P>
<P>
	Burford was in the chamber exercising the right of the eldest  
sons of peers to sit on the steps of Queen Elizabeth II's throne, 
but not take part in proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
	But the earl -- whose family motto is ``A pledge of better  
times'' -- sprang up from the steps, complaining volubly that the 
bill removed ``inalienable rights granted to my family by King 
Charles II in 1684.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Indeed the very existence of the monarchy is threatened,'' he  
said.

<HEADLINE> Yanks' Knoblauch Delivers Big Blow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Chuck Knoblauch can't find first base, but  
game-tying World Series homers appear easy. 
</P>
<P>
	For the second straight year, Knoblauch hit one, delivering a  
two-run homer in the eighth inning Tuesday night and the New York 
Yankees came back to beat the Atlanta Braves 6-5 in 10 innings to 
take a 3-0 Series lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Knoblauch has been the focus of a lot of attention this  
postseason, but not for anything positive. Instead, all people want 
to talk to him about are his throws. 
</P>
<P>
	Knoblauch made 26 errors, most by a second baseman this year and  
most by a Yankee since third baseman Graig Nettles had 26 in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
	He made 14 throwing errors and every throw to first is an  
adventure. 
</P>
<P>
	There are the lollipop ones that take an eternity to reach first  
base, the sidearm ones that put fans near the first-base dugout in 
danger and even underhanded tosses that make people laugh. 
</P>
<P>
	There are also the clutch home runs.  
</P>
<P>
	In Game 1 of the World Series last year against San Diego,  
Knoblauch hit a game-tying three-run homer in the seventh inning 
off Donne Wall that helped start the Yankees on the way to a sweep. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday night, he did it in the eighth inning against Tom  
Glavine. Knoblauch has often been criticized in his two years in 
New York for using an uppercut swing for the fences instead trying 
to hit line drives. 
</P>
<P>
	This time it worked.  
</P>
<P>
	Trailing 5-3 with Joe Girardi on first, Knoblauch hit a high fly  
to right. Brian Jordan went back to the fence and leaped to make 
the catch. The ball deflected off his glove and over the fence. 
</P>
<P>
	Knoblauch rounded the bases and his teammates, who have stuck by  
him during his struggles in the field, poured out of the dugout to 
greet him. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees eventually won it in the 10th inning on Chad Curtis'  
second solo homer. But Knoblauch helped make it possible.

<HEADLINE> Mumia Abu-Jamal Execution Upheld </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The Dec. 2 execution of Mumia Abu-Jamal was  
stayed by a federal judge on Tuesday as the former journalist and 
Black Panther began another round of appeals. 
</P>
<P>
	The stay was expected. It came 13 days after Gov. Tom Ridge  
signed the second death warrant for Abu-Jamal, who was convicted of 
murdering a police officer in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
	This latest appeal is the first to the federal courts. His  
appeal to state courts ended earlier this month when the U.S. 
Supreme Court upheld the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's rejection of 
his state appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Abu-Jamal, 45, was convicted of murder in the shooting death of  
Philadelphia police Officer Daniel Faulkner. The appeal argues that 
prosecutors manipulated witnesses to falsely identify Abu-Jamal as 
the shooter, and suppressed and destroyed critical evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	It also claims the judge was biased, blacks were improperly kept  
off the jury and Abu-Jamal's original defense was inadequate.

<HEADLINE> Ventura Mixed on Run for President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL (AP) -- Reform Party Gov. Jesse Ventura says he would  
consider a presidential run next year if Minnesotans mobilize 
behind him. 
</P>
<P>
	The governor made the comment Tuesday in an interview with  
Harvard Current magazine. Ventura has previously said he did not 
want the job of president, would not run and planned to fulfill his 
commitment to serve a four-year gubernatorial term begun in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I turn around and run for president then I lied to all the  
people of Minnesota,'' he said. ``So unless you can get Minnesotans 
to say, 'Go ahead, Governor Ventura, run for president, we give you 
our backing ...''' 
</P>
<P>
	An interviewer asked whether Ventura would run if Minnesotans  
mobilized fully behind him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd consider it, but then again I got to want the job and I'd  
have to consider it with my family and I don't know if my family 
would want me to do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He continued, ``If you can mobilize Minnesota to do it, then,  
you know, there we are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The magazine interviewer asked, ``What do you mean, 'There we  
are'?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura responded, ``That would open the door for the  
possibility of it. But by no means am I telling you I would do 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The interviewer asked, ``But there is a possibility, a hope?''  
</P>
<P>
	Ventura, ``Yeah.''  
</P>
<P>
	The governor's spokesman John Wodele was traveling with Ventura,  
but refused to comment on the contents of the interview or hand the 
phone to Ventura, who was sitting next to him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see any reason for me or any one else to expand on  
what he said,'' Wodele said. ``What he said is what he said.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wodele later said, ``If you can read this interview and arrive  
at the conclusion that he's going to be president a year from now, 
you're in political la-la land.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate interview Tuesday with WCCO Radio, Ventura sent a  
different signal about the presidential contest. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm the natural candidate to do it, but I don't want to do it.  
You gotta want the job. I don't want the job; it's that simple. I 
do not want the job,'' Ventura said. 
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota Planning Agency director Dean Barkley, who recruited  
Ventura to run for governor, said Ventura's comments to the Harvard 
Current ran counter to any discussions he had with him. 
</P>
<P>
	``In all of our discussions, he has always expressed the  
clear-cut desire not to get involved in the presidential race. I 
haven't heard anything different,'' Barkley said. ``He's clearly 
told me that he's not interested in running.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura, however, has recently expressed some interest. In an  
interview conducted in early October and published Sunday, Ventura 
told a New York Times Magazine reporter, ``I know I should be the 
candidate. But what do I do? I'm between a rock and a hard place.''

<HEADLINE> Recounting Zany History of Debates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Acres of policy and untold hours of tedium  
have registered on flickering screens since the era of TV debates 
dawned in the sweat and 5 o'clock shadow of Richard Nixon. 
</P>
<P>
	The policies are largely forgotten. What people remember are the  
rare but bracing times when a candidate made a treacherous misstep 
or rose to an opportunity, declaring: ``Where's the beef?'' ``I 
paid for this microphone!'' ``Senator, you're no Jack Kennedy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Humor, anger, appearance, self-confidence. More often than not,  
those are the qualities that have turned political debates into 
theater. Sometimes, even a command of facts has helped. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republicans and Democrats debating this week are mindful of  
the history. Indeed, a lesson learned in the Nixon-Kennedy debates 
of 1960 is very much in play today -- that the candidate who's best 
known or on top has the most to lose in debates and the greatest 
incentive to skip them. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas Gov. George Bush, favored in the GOP contest, will again  
be absent when the rest of the field debates Thursday night. On 
Wednesday night, Vice President Al Gore and Bill Bradley mix it up. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore is leading Bradley nationally -- although not in New  
Hampshire -- and is better known. But it has been his idea to debate 
Bradley early and often -- a course he began pushing when his rival 
started moving up in the polls. 
</P>
<P>
	After 1960, three elections went by before the nation saw  
another presidential debate. Only when President Ford was sinking 
against Jimmy Carter in 1976 did he agree to go face-to-face with 
him in an ultimately futile effort to come back. 
</P>
<P>
	The first Kennedy-Nixon debate, in Chicago on Sept. 26, 1960,  
featured few substantive differences between two well-spoken 
candidates, and the press did not immediately see it as the Nixon 
disaster it proved to be. 
</P>
<P>
	Nixon, who had been sick, looked hollow-eyed and dark-bearded  
and wore a gray suit that blended into the gray studio background. 
John Kennedy, his blue suit giving him contrast on black and white 
TV, was tanned and relaxed. 
</P>
<P>
	Men have been careful with makeup and razors ever since. But  
President Bush's body language in 1992 -- looking twice at his watch 
in a debate with Bill Clinton and Ross Perot -- deepened the 
impression his time was running out. 
</P>
<P>
	Ronald Reagan alternately used anger, humor and poise to score  
in a forum where he could get lost in policy intricacies. 
</P>
<P>
	Reagan came on strong in a Feb. 23, 1980, debate in Nashua,  
N.H., bringing to the stage four rivals who were not invited to 
participate in his matchup with then-front-runner George Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	Reagan's campaign had covered the rental for the hall. When  
organizers tried to turn off his sound as he explained why the four 
should join the debate, he snapped: ``I paid for this microphone,'' 
as Bush looked woefully on. 
</P>
<P>
	Reagan used humor in 1984 to get out of a hole he had dug for  
himself. After a faltering debate that raised questions about his 
stamina, Reagan faced Democrat Walter Mondale for a second time. 
</P>
<P>
	When a questioner asked him if he had any doubts that he  
possessed the strength for the job at his age, Reagan, then 73, hit 
the sweet spot. ``Not at all,'' he began. ``I will not make age an 
issue of this campaign. I am not going to exploit, for political 
purposes, my opponent's youth and inexperience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mondale had no choice but to join in the laughter. Without  
uttering a word, he saw Reagan's age problem neutralized and his 
chance of catching up in the last weeks dim. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier that year, Mondale had delivered one of the most  
memorable lines in TV debate history. Suggesting Democratic primary 
rival Gary Hart had no substance, he quoted from a fast-food 
hamburger commercial: ``Where's the beef?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Dan Quayle invoked Kennedy at his peril in  
October 1988. Debate coaches later said he was holding his own 
until he compared his qualifications to Kennedy's. ``Senator, 
you're no Jack Kennedy,'' Democrat Lloyd Bentsen said. 
</P>
<P>
	In October 1992, political novice James Stockdale, then Perot's  
running mate, faltered in debate with Gore and Quayle. But in doing 
so he asked a profound question that all candidates, one way or 
another, have to answer about their ambitions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who am I?'' Stockman asked. ``What am I doing here?''

<HEADLINE> Gray: No Apology for Rose Interview </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Although NBC's Jim Gray didn't relish his  
confrontation with Pete Rose, he doesn't regret it either. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt I did my job and I did my job well, but it wasn't a  
satisfying feeling to walk away from that,'' the NBC Sports 
reporter said Monday as baseball players and fans debated the 
propriety of his live interview with the fallen star. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC was deluged by complaints from fans in the hours after  
Gray's interview during Sunday's World Series pregame show. It 
centered on Rose's lifetime ban from the sport for gambling, and 
came minutes after Rose was announced as a member of baseball's 
All-Century team. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans seem willing to forgive Rose, speaking out in polls in  
favor of his reinstatement to baseball. He received the longest 
ovation of any baseball hero introduced Sunday at Atlanta's Turner 
Field. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose told Gray he was ``surprised you're bombarding me like  
this'' on a festive occasion. 
</P>
<P>
	Gray said his questions shouldn't have surprised Rose since  
other reporters had asked the same things at a news conference 
shortly before. 
</P>
<P>
	``I tried very hard to be very fair to Pete last night and I  
think I was very fair,'' Gray told reporters. ``The fact that he 
doesn't like it doesn't mean it wasn't fair.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mastercard International, sponsor of the All-Century team,  
called for Gray to apologize. Gray then issued a statement 
apologizing to the fans, although not Rose. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the fans felt the interview went on too long, particularly  
on a night of special celebration, then I am sorry for that,'' Gray 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dick Ebersol, chairman of NBC Sports, backed Gray by calling him  
``the best TV sports reporter of his generation.'' However, Ebersol 
said he thought the interview ``probably went too long.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rose wasn't commenting on the dispute Monday. Gray said he'd be  
back on the sidelines reporting Tuesday for Game 3 of the series, 
and he didn't expect to address the controversy. 
</P>
<P>
	Switchboards at NBC affiliates across the country were bombarded  
by phone calls from people angry at Gray -- two hours nonstop at 
WLWT in Cincinnati, where Rose collected most of his record 4,256 
hits for the hometown Reds. 
</P>
<P>
	In an e-mail to The Associated Press, one fan wrote of being  
enraged that Rose was ``blindsided'' during what should have been a 
proud moment, and said it gives the press a bad name. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope NBC buys a collar and leash for the bulldog,'' the  
writer said. 
</P>
<P>
	New York Yankees manager Joe Torre said it was uncalled for.  
``For some reason, we've lost sight of the word `respect.' We deal 
too much in shock value.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We were pretty much all disgusted with Jim,'' Yankees  
outfielder Darryl Strawberry said. ``It was a night of celebration 
for Pete Rose. Every player who ever plays cares about Pete Rose. 
It was embarrassing. It didn't sit too well in this clubhouse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gray's colleague, NBC analyst Joe Morgan, a teammate of Rose's  
with the Cincinnati Reds, was careful not to place the blame on 
either person. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was cringing and hoping that Pete would have the right  
answers,'' Morgan said. ``I was just hoping the interview would be 
over the next second.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some leapt to Gray's defense. ``I thought it was the best TV  
interview I've ever seen,'' said Murray Chass, baseball writer for 
The New York Times. ``It was appropriate. It was not overdone. Rose 
has put himself in position to be pressed like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John Dowd, the investigator whose 1989 probe of Rose led to the  
ban, said he tipped his hat to Gray. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought he had more guts than any guy I've ever seen,'' Dowd  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Former baseball Commissioner Fay Vincent said Gray knows how  
overwhelming the evidence is against Rose. ``For Pete to just stand 
there and look Jim Gray in the eye and deny he bet on baseball, 
it's obviously a challenge that any interviewer can't let go. I 
recognize it was aggressive, but Rose was aggressive.''

<HEADLINE> Kasarova a Star Mezzo-Soprano </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- While there's a dearth of world-class tenors, an  
assembly line seems to be producing amazing mezzo-sopranos. 
</P>
<P>
	Vesselina Kasarova may be the most unfamiliar to United States  
audiences, already acquainted with such stars as Cecilia Bartoli, 
Denyce Graves, Olga Borodina, Anne Sofie von Otter, Angelika 
Kirchschlager, Susan Graham and Jennifer Larmore, all commanding 
above-the-title billing. 
</P>
<P>
	Kasarova, a 33-year-old Bulgarian, gave a star-turn performance  
Monday night in the trousers role of Romeo in the Opera Orchestra 
of New York's concert performance of Bellini's ``I Capuleti e i 
Montecchi.'' Such was the beauty of her singing that the first act 
was stopped four times by loud ovations, twice following arias and 
twice following duets with soprano Annick Massis, who sang 
Giulietta. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years ago, Kasarova made her New York debut with the Opera  
Orchestra in Rossini's ``Tancredi,'' a performance that drew raves. 
It's easy to understand why, her smoky voice easily managing the 
most difficult trills and transitions bel canto opera offers. 
</P>
<P>
	But while she has been starring in Europe for a decade, she is  
only making her San Francisco Opera debut this season, singing in 
Mozart's ``Idomeneo,'' the role of her Chicago Lyric Opera debut 
two years ago. Her Metropolitan Opera debut was postponed when she 
became ill, but she's now scheduled there for Octavian in Strauss' 
``Der Rosenkavalier'' next fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Romeo is a trousers part, Kasarova projected sexiness --  
it was a trousers and high-heels role. 
</P>
<P>
	And what singing. Right from her entrance in the third scene,  
``Lieto del dolce incarco,'' her voice sent sparks flying. Her duet 
with Massis, ``Ah! mia Giulietta!'' was the highlight of the 
evening. 
</P>
<P>
	After a shaky start, with some notes tending to go sharp, Massis  
matched Kasarova. 
</P>
<P>
	``Capuleti'' is not nearly as well known as the best of  
Bellini's 10 operas, ``I Puritani,'' ``Norma'' and ``La 
Sonnambula.'' And it isn't heard nearly as often as Gounod's French 
version of Shakespeare's story. ``Romeo et Juliette.'' 
(``Capuleti'' has never been performed at the Met.) 
</P>
<P>
	Tenor Gregory Kunde had a tight top as Tebaldo, and bass Philip  
Cokorinos was thunderous as Capellio. 
</P>
<P>
	Eve Queler, the Opera Orchestra's music director and conductor,  
once again showed there is no better ear for spotting young talent 
and bringing it to the United States.

<HEADLINE> Michael Cage Returns to Nets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- After a visit to his ailing father  
and flirting with retirement, Michael Cage returned to the New 
Jersey Nets Tuesday and said he was ready to play. 
</P>
<P>
	The 37-year-old Cage was signed to a one-year, $1 million deal  
before training camp. He has not been playing with the team, which 
had its opening practice on Oct. 5. 
</P>
<P>
	But the backup center was at practice Tuesday and said he was  
not yet ready to retire. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt I needed to withdraw myself and talk with my family and  
decide if I was doing the right thing,'' Cage said. 
</P>
<P>
	``After thinking about it and getting the issue resolved with my  
father's illness, everything kind of seemed to come together. I was 
able to say `I will play. I want to play.' My wife and family are 
all comfortable with that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cage's father, James, had a heart attack about six weeks ago.  
</P>
<P>
	Cage, a 14-year veteran, last played in the NBA with the Nets in  
1997-98, averaging 1.3 points and 3.9 rebounds as they reached the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	He was traded to Seattle on Jan. 21, in a deal that brought Jim  
McIlvaine to New Jersey, but was later waived. He did not play 
basketball for almost 18 months before being re-signed by the Nets.

<HEADLINE> Curtis Was an Unlikely Star </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- As the ball sailed into the Braves' bullpen,  
Chad Curtis pumped both fists into the air. And then he did it 
again. 
</P>
<P>
	Then came a high-five from Jose Cardenal, and another from  
Willie Randolph at third base. 
</P>
<P>
	He was flying around the bases, taking the jog of his life.  
</P>
<P>
	There he was Tuesday night, hitting the first World Series  
walk-off home run since Joe Carter took Mitch Williams deep in 
1993. His 10th-inning drive off Mike Remlinger gave the New York 
Yankees a 6-5 win and a 3-0 Series lead. 
</P>
<P>
	No major league team has overcome a 3-0 postseason deficit -- not  
in the playoffs, not in the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	No matter what else happens, Curtis has that moment, a replay  
that will be shown over and over in Yankee Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	All the other Yankees are well-known: Jeter and Williams,  
Knoblauch and O'Neill, Martinez and Brosius, Davis and Girardi. 
</P>
<P>
	But Curtis?  
</P>
<P>
	He was supposed to lose his job to Darryl Strawberry.  
</P>
<P>
	Or to Shane Spencer.  
</P>
<P>
	Or to Ricky Ledee.  
</P>
<P>
	But when it was time to lead off the 10th inning, Curtis was  
there.

<HEADLINE> GTE Sells Oklahoma Phone Properties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IRVING, Texas (AP) -- GTE said Tuesday it has agreed to sell its  
telephone exchanges and about 120,000 customer access lines in 
Oklahoma to dba Communications, a newcomer to the 
telecommunications industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Privately-held dba Communications already had agreed to buy GTE  
properties in Texas and New Mexico. The three acquisitions total 
about $1.7 billion and will close in mid-2000, GTE leaders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dba was formed by a group of Hispanic investors, mostly from New  
Mexico, and three venture-capital firms. The company said Tuesday 
it will move its headquarters from Washington, D.C., to Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale nearly completes an effort by Irving-based GTE, which  
Bell Atlantic is acquiring, to sell 1.6 million local phone lines 
and shift its focus into emerging technologies. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're simply shedding about 7 percent of our local phone lines  
across the country and using the proceeds to invest in 
higher-growth activities, such as wireless, data and Internet,'' 
said spokesman Bill Kula. 
</P>
<P>
	GTE is still negotiating to sell about 100,000 local customer  
lines in Illinois and could announce a deal next month, Kula said. 
It has sold lines in 12 states since May. 
</P>
<P>
	Dba Communications gets 27 telephone exchanges in the Oklahoma  
deal, which also includes 140 GTE employees. When the deal closes, 
dba Communications will have about 520,000 customer-access lines 
and more than 500 employees. It is among the 20 largest U.S. local 
phone-service companies, according to an industry group. 
</P>
<P>
	Dba's investors include former New Mexico Gov. Toney Anaya,  
former U.S. Interior Secretary and New Mexico Congressman Manuel 
Lujan Jr. and 10 other Hispanic businessmen. 
</P>
<P>
	In trading Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange, GTE's shares  
fell 18 3/4 cents to $71.50.

<HEADLINE> Stocks End Mixed; Dow Falls 47.80 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>

</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks closed lower Tuesday as investors'  
nervousness about inflation and interest rates again overshadowed 
upbeat earnings news. But Intel got a boost as it and Microsoft 
were picked as new components of the Dow Jones industrial average. 
</P>
<P>
	At the close of trading on Wall Street, the Dow was down 47.80  
at 10,302.13, having surrendered an earlier 59-point gain. The blue 
chips fell 120 points on Monday amid uneasiness over higher rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500  
index was down 11.72 at 1,281.91, and the Nasdaq composite index 
was off 4.48 at 2,811.47. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks were hampered by continuing concerns about inflation,  
especially as the Federal Reserve's next policy-setting meeting 
approaches on Nov. 16. The jitters have caused investors to look 
past better-than-expected earnings reports, including news Tuesday 
of strong earnings from Lucent Technologies. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market is still under pressure, and the interest rate  
question is probably a big part of it,'' said Charles White, 
president and portfolio manager at Avatar Associates. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to get some idea of what the Fed will be doing in  
November,'' said White. ``Until that, the stock market has a very 
limited upside.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Reserve Bank president in Richmond, Va., Alfred  
Broaddus, also cast a pall over the market when he warned that the 
economy still runs the risk of overheating, despite rising 
productivity. 
</P>
<P>
	``That threw a pail of water on the market,'' said Barry Berman,  
head trader for Robert W. Baird &AMP; Co. in Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
	Rising yields in the bond market also held stocks back. Analysts  
said the bond market was depressed ahead of the release later this 
week of data on the gross domestic product and employment costs. 
</P>
<P>
	In late afternoon, the yield on the Treasury's 30-year bond was  
up to 6.37 percent from late Monday's 6.35 percent. In earlier 
trading, slightly lower yields had helped support stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	A Conference Board report of a drop in consumer confidence  
during October helped the stock market only briefly. 
</P>
<P>
	While the market was initially cheered by Lucent Technologies'  
earnings, stocks were unable to sustain their gains. But Lucent 
ended the day up 3 at 62 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Dow Jones &AMP; Co. announced that Intel and Microsoft are being  
added to the Dow, becoming the first Nasdaq stocks ever chosen by 
publisher of The Wall Street Journal for its blue-chip index. 
</P>
<P>
	Retailer Home Depot and the telephone company SBC Communications  
will also join the Dow as of Nov. 1, replacing Sears, Roebuck; 
Goodyear Tire &AMP; Rubber; Chevron and Union Carbide. The changes are 
expected to make the Dow a clearer reflection of the modern 
economy, in which technology has driven growth. 
</P>
<P>
	The new Dow stocks initially rose sharply on the news. But just  
as interest rate worries punctured the market's optimism about 
earnings, they also cut into the four stocks' gains. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel rose 3/16, closing at 71 7/16, and SBC was up 1 5/16 to 45  
9/16, although Microsoft ended the day down 1/16 at 92 3/8. Home Depot 
was down 1 1/4 at 70 11/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues finished ahead of advancers by a margin of  
about 8-to-5 on the New York Stock Exchange. Volume of all listed 
shares totaled 1.06 billion shares, compared with 936.95 million in 
the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index fell 1.97 to 415.79.  
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.1 percent.  
Germany's DAX index closed up 1.28 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 
fell 1.38 percent, and France's CAC-40 closed 0.8 percent.

<HEADLINE> AmericaOne Granted Time for Repairs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) -- America's Cup races resume  
Wednesday, for all except AmericaOne, after a delay because of 
crashes. 
</P>
<P>
	The American boat, the $32 million campaign of the St. Francis  
Yacht Club, was granted another 24 hours to fix its 
collision-damaged yacht. 
</P>
<P>
	It suffered extensive damage to its stern after Dennis Conner's  
Stars and Stripes crashed into it during pre-start maneuvers on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	AmericaOne's races against New York challenger Young America and  
Young Australia are now scheduled for Thursday, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	But winds were forecast to be stronger Wednesday than those set  
down for the competition, and officials warned that the first round 
of races might be delayed again. 
</P>
<P>
	San Francisco's America True and some other one-boat syndicates  
have complained about the delays because it means they can't begin 
reconfiguring their boats before the more important second 
round-robin, due to start Nov. 6. 
</P>
<P>
	America True skipper Dawn Riley criticized the rule preventing  
her team from changing their boat, and said the extension granted 
to AmericaOne would further disrupt her team's preparations. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are very disappointed that one competitor's thorough boat  
repairs have delayed racing and delayed other teams' plans,'' Riley 
said today. ``We just want to make our boat faster -- this isn't 
helping.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole goal is to select the fastest boat as a group to  
challenge Team New Zealand. This delay is just tying people's hands 
behind their backs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first round-robin in the regatta to decide which of 11  
challenger teams will take on the defenders Team New Zealand for 
the America's Cup in February 2000, was meant to end Oct. 23. 
</P>
<P>
	But a rule which says racing cannot start if winds are stronger  
than 18 knots delayed the competition once last week, and a further 
three-day delay was ordered after a spate of collisions and mishaps 
left several boats damaged. 
</P>
<P>
	Also on Saturday, Swiss boat Fast 2000 was crippled when a  
bulkhead tore free from the hull, and Japanese team Nippon collided 
with the Spanish team's boat. 
</P>
<P>
	Under race rules, teams cannot significantly change their boats  
during competition. But at least three teams have said they want to 
reconfigure their boats between round-robin 1-- worth just one point 
per win -- and round-robin 2 -- worth four points. 
</P>
<P>
	Weather forecasters said a cold front threatened to bring winds  
of 20-30 knots to the race courses on Auckland's Hauraki Gulf on 
Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Industrial Output Falls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese industrial production declined 0.8 percent  
in September from August, dragged down by drops in output of 
machinery and plastics, the government said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ministry of International Trade and Industry said it expects  
output to fall 0.9 percent in October from September but then 
increase 3.8 percent in November. 
</P>
<P>
	The decline in September follows a surge of 4.6 percent in  
August from July, the strongest monthly increase since January 1997 
when production rose 5.3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The September decline, measured after adjustment for seasonal  
factors, matched the forecasts of economists surveyed by Dow Jones 
Newswires. 
</P>
<P>
	Sectors that contributed most to the decline were general  
machinery, electric machinery and plastic products. Production of 
printing machinery, personal computers and steam turbine parts 
fell, partly in response to the sharp rises in August. 
</P>
<P>
	Automobile and other transportation equipment remained strong  
even after the 8 percent month-on-month output rise in August, MITI 
said.

<HEADLINE> Fiber May Help Prevent Obesity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A high-fiber diet, already linked to  
preventing heart disease and cancer, also appears to help fight 
obesity, according to a new study published in today's Journal of 
the American Medical Association. 
</P>
<P>
	The study found that young adults who ate at least 21 grams of  
fiber per day gained, on average, eight pounds less over a 10-year 
period than those who ate the least amount of fiber. 
</P>
<P>
	``At all levels of fat intake, individuals eating the most fiber  
gained less weight than those eating the least fiber,'' according 
to the study presented at an American Medical Association 
conference for science reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	The new study involved more than 2,900 adults who consumed 15  
grams to 25 grams of fiber daily (a bowl of high-fiber cereal can 
contain 25 grams). 
</P>
<P>
	In the study, fiber consumption also seemed to provide a more  
accurate gauge than fat consumption when predicting weight gain, 
blood cholesterol levels and other risks for cardiovascular 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not recommending that we go out and put Metamucil on our  
Haagen-Dazs,'' said study author Dr. David Ludwig of Children's 
Hospital in Boston. But ``you certainly do better by eating 
unprocessed foods -- the way grandma told us to eat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Federal guidelines recommended 20 to 25 grams of fiber per day.  
The study made no recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
	Fiber slows the rate of nutrient absorption following a meal,  
reducing the rise of blood sugar levels and secretion of insulin. A 
high blood insulin level has been associated as a risk factor for 
cardiovascular disease.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Library Raising Money </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Bill Clinton ran for president in 1992 with  
Fleetwood Mac's ``Don't Stop Thinking About Tomorrow'' as his theme 
song. Clinton hasn't stopped -- he's absorbed these days with the 
presidential library that will house his legacy. 
</P>
<P>
	Even in the midst of intense partisan maneuvering over the  
budget, health care and arms control, Clinton has made time for 
library planning and fund-raising meetings recently. 
</P>
<P>
	As he heads into the final full year of his term, Clinton often  
jokes that he wishes he could run for something else, but also 
muses about the work ahead planning and building a library in 
Little Rock, Ark., to house his presidential papers and trinkets, 
and present museum-style exhibits about the Clinton presidency. 
</P>
<P>
	At an August political dinner in Little Rock, Clinton outlined  
his hopes for the library this way: ``I'm ... trying to bring 
people from all over the world here to see our state and to talk 
about what we did and what we still need to do in our country and 
in our world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The library will be paid for and endowed by private donations  
but operated by the National Archives, which operates 10 of the 
existing 11 presidential libraries. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nixon Library and Birthplace Foundation in Yorba Linda,  
Calif., is not part of the federal system because of an ongoing 
court fight over records and tape recordings seized by the 
government when Nixon resigned in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Clinton announced plans for his post-White House  
library in 1997, formal planning and fund-raising was delayed 
somewhat by last year's impeachment saga, sources familiar with the 
project said. 
</P>
<P>
	Several moths ago, after the sex-and-cover-up scandal faded from  
the headlines, Clinton began holding private meetings with people 
he hopes to recruit as donors. Clinton needs to raise at least $100 
million to build, equip and endow the library in his home state. 
</P>
<P>
	So far there has been no formal solicitation process, such as a  
mass mailing or other direct appeal for cash. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're really still in the planning stages,'' said the  
project's leader, Little Rock public relations executive Skip 
Rutherford. 
</P>
<P>
	According to tax documents, the William J. Clinton Library  
Foundation brought in about $3 million last year, its first full 
year of operation. The loosely organized, three-member foundation 
projected a $7 million take this year. 
</P>
<P>
	But the real amount of money promised to the library is much  
higher, and the list of donors is secret. Rutherford would not say 
whether the foundation has a yearly fund-raising goal, or whether 
the effort is on pace so far. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and chief library fund-raiser Terence McAuliffe met with  
about 15 potential donors in New York City this month. A week 
before that gathering, Clinton held a similar meeting during a 
political trip to New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
	Another intimate, library-related reception was scheduled during  
a Clinton trip to Las Vegas and California two weeks ago, but 
scrubbed at the last minute. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president has taken some time on recent trips to meet with  
friends and supporters to talk about his ideas for his 
post-presidency library,'' White House press secretary Joe Lockhart 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Participants include wealthy supporters of past Clinton  
campaigns and supporters of Democrats in general, such as fashion 
designer Vera Wang, who attended a library-related party in New 
York last summer. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House does not label these by-invitation-only  
gatherings ``fund-raisers,'' since there is no entrance fee and no 
express requirement that participants become contributors. Willing 
donors typically pledge amounts of $1 million or more, and agree to 
write the check at some later date, sources familiar with the 
gatherings said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many friends and supporters of the president are already  
offering to help,'' Rutherford said. ``People have indicated they 
want to support the library'' down the road, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The library foundation is not a political body, so its donors  
are not subject either to national limits on political donations or 
requirements that their names and addresses be publicly released. 
</P>
<P>
	The private legal defense fund set up to help defray the  
Clintons' Whitewater-related lawyer bills voluntarily released 
donor information, but the library fund has not followed suit. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, all library fund-raising events have been held outside  
the White House, said Jim Kennedy, spokesman for the White House 
counsel's office. There is no rule against having such events 
inside the White House, and Ronald Reagan did just that with a 
series of dinners during his second term. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has said he plans to divide his post-White House time  
between New York, where his wife may or may not be a U.S. senator 
by then, and Little Rock. He refers to plans for the library often, 
especially during speeches to fellow Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very much on his mind,'' said New York architect James  
Polshek, who was chosen by Clinton over the summer to design and 
build the library on a 26-acre riverfront site in Little Rock. 
</P>
<P>
	Polshek would not discuss the construction schedule in detail,  
but said the building will not be finished when Clinton leaves 
office in January 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also recently hired an exhibit designer, who will have  
the unprecedented task of presenting the Monica Lewinsky scandal 
alongside brighter moments in the Clinton tenure. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think whether you agree or disagree with President Clinton,  
like him or don't like him, his presidency as a whole has been one 
of the most fascinating and intriguing presidencies in American 
history,'' Rutherford said. ``I believe there's going to be a lot 
of interest.''

<HEADLINE> Insurance Co. Monitoring Drivers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- The lure of saving up to one-fourth off their  
premiums has some drivers subjecting their behind-the-wheel habits 
to the scrutiny of their auto insurer via a ``black box'' installed 
in their car. 
</P>
<P>
	Progressive Insurance Co., the nation's fifth-largest auto  
insurer, has placed hundreds of monitoring devices in customers' 
vehicles to measure how much they drive, when and where. 
</P>
<P>
	The customers, all in Texas, volunteered for the 14-month-old  
test program, which the suburban Cleveland company calls Autograph 
and charges extra for. The incentive is that customers can save up 
to 25 percent on insurance rates tailored to their individual 
driving habits rather than broad estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	The company expects to benefit by getting new business from  
consumers who like the idea of having some control over their 
insurance rates and saving money, said Bob McMillan, Progressive's 
director of consumer marketing. 
</P>
<P>
	But privacy advocates said they were concerned that use of the  
black boxes could be expanded. The device's patent describes a 
system of onboard sensors that could track whether a driver signals 
before turning, tailgates or stops so sharply that anti-lock brakes 
engage. McMillan says that once a month, the company's computer 
calls the device in the car and uploads the information it has 
collected. 
</P>
<P>
	``There could be a high degree of interest from the government  
in getting access to this type of data. It could be used for 
litigation between private parties or by law enforcement. You can't 
create a swimming pool of data without putting a fence around it,'' 
said Deirdre Mulligan, spokeswoman for the Center for Democracy and 
Technology, a free speech and privacy group. 
</P>
<P>
	Progressive does not plan to release any of its driving records  
to marketers unless they are ``consumer friendly and the customer 
agrees,'' McMillan said. 
</P>
<P>
	The company won't say if it is going to expand the test beyond  
Texas, but McMillan said there are no immediate plans to change the 
scope of what is monitored. 
</P>
<P>
	``The product's working right now. It's easy to understand and  
we wouldn't want to complicate it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rolling out a nationwide plan would be time consuming because  
insurance regulations vary from state to state. Progressive started 
the program in Texas because it isn't subject to state regulation 
there. 
</P>
<P>
	The cost for participating is $1 per month for one car and $15  
per month for each additional car, plus installation charges, which 
Progressive would not give figures for. 
</P>
<P>
	The black boxes are another in a long line of technology that  
lets consumers gain savings, safety or convenience in exchange for 
giving up information about where they travel or what they buy. For 
example, some toll booths have sensors to read monthly passes and 
video cameras to catch violators. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Ellis Smith, publisher of the monthly newsletter, Privacy  
Journal, said he was concerned about people being observed more 
than ever. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not just the disclosure of information, it's the effect  
of one's psyche of being tracked all the time,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Progressive makes customers aware of any privacy concerns by  
having them sign a contract, McMillan said. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we talked to consumers, most had a privacy issue, but  
when we told them that data would be used to help them save money 
and used only in a specific way, they agreed,'' McMillan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other insurance companies probably will be reluctant to try such  
a non-traditional approach to calculating rates, said Jim Jones, 
spokesman for the non-profit Insurance Institute of America based 
in Malvern, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	``Companies have had their own systems in place. They have a  
legacy of systems that they've invested a lot of money into, and 
you're not going to see a lot of shift in that overnight,'' he 
said. ``I think they'll take a wait-and-see approach.''

<HEADLINE> N.H. Poll: Bradley Leads Gore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- Bill Bradley has a narrow lead over Al Gore  
in New Hampshire and fares better in a hypothetical matchup with 
GOP front-runner George W. Bush than the vice president would in 
the state, says a poll released today. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the 455 Democratic voters surveyed, Bradley had an  
apparent lead of 47 percent to Gore's 39 percent in the Quinnipiac 
College Poll. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the 459 Republican voters surveyed, 41 percent favored  
Bush to 28 percent for Arizona Sen. John McCain. Ten percent were 
for Steve Forbes. No other candidate was higher than 5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	New Hampshire holds the nation's first presidential primary Feb.  
1. Several recent polls have shown Gore and Bradley in a 
statistical dead heat, and one other gave Bradley a narrow lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore and Bradley face each other Wednesday night in a forum in  
Hanover, the first nationally televised meeting of the two 
Democratic candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	A Boston Globe poll of New Hampshire voters released over the  
weekend showed Bradley and Gore in a statistical dead heat, with 45 
percent for Bradley and 42 percent for Gore. Bradley continued to 
draw stronger support from independents than Gore. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> No Letup on Purdue Schedule </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- It was a nightmare schedule. Four ranked  
teams in four weeks. Now Purdue and quarterback Drew Brees get a 
break at Minnesota, although in this unpredictable Big Ten season, 
nothing is certain anymore. 
</P>
<P>
	``What's most important is the four weeks we have coming up, not  
the four weeks we've been through, although I do think having 
played this stretch of games has helped to mature our team and 
helped our team grow,'' coach Joe Tiller said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	On successive weeks, Purdue played Michigan, Ohio State,  
Michigan State and Penn State, with the only victory a 52-28 upset 
of Michigan State two weeks ago. The Boilermakers (5-3, 2-3) 
dropped to 18th in this week's AP poll. 
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota (5-2, 2-2) has lost three straight to Purdue,  
including 56-21 in West Lafayette last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a very interesting four weeks for us,'' Tiller said.  
``I think we're better prepared certainly to play the balance of 
our schedule than we were prior to the month of October. 
</P>
<P>
	``All coaches talk about one game at a time. The teams that are  
most apt to live the philosophy are the ones that are going to be 
most successful. The things that are pleasing to us are we're a 
better football team than we were a month ago, plus we are 
relatively healthy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A year ago, Brees passed for 522 yards against Minnesota and  
comes into Saturday's game with 6,916 career yards, fourth among 
all Purdue quarterbacks. He is the Boilermakers' career leader in 
completion percentage at 61.6. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has the intangibles, he's extremely competitive and  
intelligent,'' Tiller said. ``He has good feet, good vision and is 
extremely accurate as a thrower.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Minnesota has improved, too.  
</P>
<P>
	``We think they're more athletic in the secondary,'' the coach  
said. ``Also, the Gophers are heavily involved in one-back offense 
now, and the wideouts and the multiple formations. They've 
practiced against this offense much more than they have in the 
past, so there are a lot of reasons why they'll be better 
prepared.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And Purdue's defense has shown improvement, too, he said.  
</P>
<P>
	``Particularly well the last two weeks ... although we gave up  
17 points defensively against Penn State. Our defense in 2 1/2 years, 
almost three, is a much more active defense,'' Tiller said. ``We 
have better team speed. We're still not where we'd like to be 
defensively, but certainly we're closer with our athleticism and 
foot speed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senior Adrian Beasley leads the Big Ten with five interceptions,  
two shy of the school record. One more would give him a 
Purdue-record 12 interceptions for his career. 
</P>
<P>
	Purdue outgained Penn State last week but gave up 14 points on  
turnovers and lost 31-25 when Brees couldn't find a receiver on 
four tries from the Nittany Lions' 12 in the final seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a good game, at least the fans tell me that,'' Tiller  
said. ``When you're not successful, it seems everything else is 
irrelevant.''

<P>
	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- In a move to sharply reduce the  
military's political dominance, Indonesia's new president took the 
radical step Tuesday of appointing a civilian to run the Defense 
Ministry. 
</P>
<P>
	President Abdurrahman Wahid, whose election by parliament last  
week marked Indonesia's transition to democracy, announced a 
Cabinet filled with political neophytes, Islamic party politicians 
and fewer military officials than ever before. 
</P>
<P>
	Juwono Sudarsono, Indonesia's first civilian defense minister in  
four decades, faces the huge task of reforming a military widely 
accused of human rights abuses and meddling in politics and of 
keeping restive parts of the country from trying to break away. 
</P>
<P>
	Juwono, education minister in the Cabinet of just-ousted  
President B.J. Habibie, once served as vice-governor of the 
National Defense Institute, the military's main think-tank. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's nonpartisan but has a good relationship with the armed  
forces,'' said analyst Salim Said. ``He would not be considered a 
threat to the military. He would be a good bridge between the 
president and the military.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Juwono will take over the Defense Ministry from Gen. Wiranto,  
the powerful military leader who also was replaced as commander of 
Indonesia's armed forces. Wiranto, like many Indonesians, uses only 
one name. 
</P>
<P>
	Wiranto, who was awarded the senior post of political and  
security affairs minister, played a major political role in 
Indonesia's bumpy and sometimes bloody transition to democracy 
after the ouster of authoritarian President Suharto in May 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Wahid said Juwono was appointed at Wiranto's suggestion.  
</P>
<P>
	``Don't think that the military are crazy,'' Wahid said. ``They  
know that the whole society is changing now. Because of this, Gen. 
Wiranto also knows that the military has to change its attitude 
toward society.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new Cabinet includes only six active or retired generals --  
the fewest ever. 
</P>
<P>
	In an unprecedented move, Wiranto will be replaced as military  
chief by a navy officer, Adm. Widodo Adisutjipto, who was Wiranto's 
deputy. The navy is regarded as less corrupt and brutal than the 
army. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesia's military long has served a major political role that  
was trimmed back since Suharto's departure. It has 38 of the 700 
seats in the People's Consultative Assembly, the country's highest 
legislative body, half its total from past assemblies. 
</P>
<P>
	Juwono raised the possibility Tuesday that those seats could be  
eliminated as well. He also said he was considering appointment of 
other civilians to top defense posts. 
</P>
<P>
	Wahid described his new Cabinet as a ``national unity'' Cabinet  
that would focus on pulling Indonesia out of its worst economic 
crisis in more than three decades. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to make economic recovery our prime goal,'' Wahid said  
in a nationally televised address. ``Second is to maintain our 
territorial integrity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite demands he choose a completely new team, four of the 35  
ministers were holdovers from the corrupt, autocratic regimes of 
Suharto and Habibie. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are some compromises,'' Wahid said from Jakarta's ornate  
Merdeka Palace, once home to Dutch colonial governors. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of Wahid's poor eyesight, Vice President Megawati  
Sukarnoputri read the list of new Cabinet members. 
</P>
<P>
	In two other significant reforms, Wahid abolished the Ministry  
of Information, used in the past to control and bully the media, 
and created a spot for human rights affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	While there is wide representation of Indonesia's ethnic  
diversity at a time of growing discontent in the sprawling 
archipelago's outer regions, Islamic influence has never been 
stronger in the Cabinet of the world's most populous Muslim nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost one-third of the new lineup come from Muslim-oriented  
political parties. Wahid heads the country's largest Islamic 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Among them is new Foreign Minister Alwi Shihab, a U.S.-educated  
college professor and Islamic studies expert. Shihab has said he 
wants to fix Indonesia's international reputation, tarnished by 
years of human rights abuses. 
</P>
<P>
	Displaying an immediate break from the past, new Attorney  
General Marzuki Darusman said he would review a decision by 
Habibie's government to drop a corruption probe of Suharto, accused 
of amassing a fortune during his 32-year rule. 
</P>
<P>
	Kwik Kian Gie, who had criticized policies imposed upon  
debt-ridden Indonesia by the International Monetary Fund, was 
chosen senior economics minister. He has taken a more conciliatory 
tone toward the IMF recently. 
</P>
<P>
	The new finance minister, in charge of the national budget, is a  
relative unknown, economics professor Bambang Sudibyo.

	No Quick Answers in Stewart Crash  
</P>
<P>
	MINA, S.D. (AP) -- Investigators cautioned today that there will  
be no quick explanation for why no one was conscious at the 
controls for four hours yesterday when the Learjet carrying golfer 
Payne Stewart and five others flew 1,400 miles across the country 
before running out of fuel and slamming nose-first into the ground 
in South Dakota. Everyone on board was killed. Tissue samples from 
the victims will be tested for such substances as carbon monoxide. 
But toxicology tests may be worthless in attempting to verify the 
theory that the victims suffered oxygen deprivation because of a 
sudden decompression of the aircraft.

	GROZNY, Russia (AP) -- Exploding artillery shells rattled windows  
and spread fear in the Chechen capital Tuesday, as the heaviest 
fighting in weeks brought Russian tanks and soldiers near the city 
limits. U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright called the

	BEIJING (AP) -- Chinese police detained dozens of members of the  
Falun Gong spiritual movement on Tuesday after they went to 
Tiananmen Square to protest in defiance of a government ban on the 
group. The low-key protest, which participants knew virtually 
assured their arrests, showed that a three-month government 
crackdown and campaign of vilification targeting the group's 
leaders has yet to eradicate the once widely popular movement. The 
protesters apparently hoped to highlight their disapproval of a 
proposed law against Falun Gong and other groups China's communist 
leaders view as dangerous cults.

	ST. PAUL (AP) -- Reform Party Gov. Jesse Ventura says he would  
consider a presidential run next year if Minnesotans mobilize 
behind him. The governor made the comment today in an interview 
with Harvard Current magazine. Ventura has previously said he did 
not want the job of president, would not run and planned to fulfill 
his commitment to serve a four-year gubernatorial term begun in 
1999. In a separate interview today with WCCO Radio, Ventura sent a 
different signal about the presidential contest: ``I'm the natural 
candidate to do it, but I don't want to do it. I don't want the 
job.''

be able to speed responses to highway accidents, crimes and natural 
disasters, Clinton said. While 911 is widely used as the emergency 
number for traditional phones, there are 20 different codes for 
wireless callers across the country. The changes are aimed at 
cutting response times for the crews who answer 98,000 emergency 
calls daily from cellular phone callers.

<HEADLINE> Many Gulf War Vets Are Compensated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A higher percentage of Gulf War veterans are  
receiving disability compensation than veterans of any other 
period, the Clinton administration said Tuesday. The No. 1 
complaint is knee injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 700,000 Gulf War veterans, roughly 16 percent are  
receiving disability compensation, said Joseph Thompson, Veterans 
Affairs undersecretary for benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	That compares with 8.6 percent of the remaining World War II  
veterans, 5 percent of Korean veterans and 9.6 percent of Vietnam 
era veterans, Thompson told the House Veterans Affairs Committee. 
Benefit checks also go to 9.5 percent of veterans who served during 
peacetime. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the total 202,272 Gulf War claims processed, Thompson said in  
prepared testimony, only 11,407 -- under 6 percent -- have been for 
``undiagnosed illness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Veterans' groups and advocates for those suffering from Gulf War  
ailments complained that the report continues an administration 
practice of understating the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the processed claimed for ``undiagnosed illness,'' 3,077 were  
granted and 8,330 denied, Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most denials resulted from a finding of no disability, a  
diagnosis that was not service-connected or a diagnosis that was 
service connected,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The number one service-connected condition claimed is  
``impairment of the knee,'' he said, followed by skeletal system 
disability, lumbosacral strain, arthritis due to trauma, scars, 
hearing loss, hypertension, intervertebral disc syndrome, tinnitus 
and osteoarthritis. 
</P>
<P>
	Joy Ilem, associate director of the Disabled American Veterans,  
suggested that many physicians, reluctant to provide a report of 
``undiagnosed illness'' because of pressure within the Department 
of Veterans Affairs health care system, enter a diagnosis they 
believe is a ``reasonable probability.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The plight of Persian Gulf War veterans suffering from  
unexplained illnesses related to the service in the Persian Gulf 
continues to be one of our foremost concerns,'' Ilem said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bottom line is that thousands of Gulf War veterans with  
serious physical illnesses and conditions have been left unattended 
to,'' said William Frasure, deputy director for the Vietnam 
Veterans of America. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress passed legislation in 1994 granting Veterans Affairs  
the authority to compensate those with difficult-to-diagnose and 
ill-defined illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``VA has failed to implement the law, and thousands of Gulf War  
veterans remain without compensation for these service-connected 
disabilities,'' said Matthew Puglish, a representative of the 
American Legion. 
</P>
<P>
	A presidential panel looking into Gulf War illnesses said in  
August that it couldn't pinpoint causes of the ailments and 
recommended further studies into whether genetic reasons caused 
some troops to get sick while others did not.

<HEADLINE> Parents of Columbine Gunman Talk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- After months of refusing to talk to  
investigators, the parents of Columbine High School gunman Eric 
Harris met with authorities, authorities said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Wayne and Katherine Harris and their lawyers met with Jefferson  
County Sheriff John Stone, District Attorney Dave Thomas and 
sheriff's investigators on Monday, the Jefferson County Sheriff's 
Office said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Harrises answered detectives' questions and all parties  
anticipate that future meetings will take place,'' the sheriff's 
department said in a statement. ``No further details about any of 
the meetings will be made available, including time, date, place 
and content.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A phone call made after business hours Tuesday to one of the  
Harrises' attorneys, Ben Colkitt, was not returned. 
</P>
<P>
	Eric Harris, along with Dylan Klebold, killed 12 classmates and  
a teacher and wounded 23 others before killing themselves on April 
20. 
</P>
<P>
	One obstacle to the Harrises talking to investigators was a  
request for immunity that was dropped weeks ago, said sheriff's 
spokesman Steve Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom and Sue Klebold, the parents of the other gunman, have met  
with investigators at least twice, Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole idea with interviewing the Klebolds and the Harrises  
is just to find out more about their two sons,'' Davis said. 
``We're trying to find out what they did, who they spent their time 
with ...'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Harrises were questioned as the sheriff's office assembles  
the final details of a voluminous report on the worst school 
shooting in the nation's history. Davis did not say when that 
report will be issued.

<HEADLINE> Caddie Stayed Behind, Designer Went  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Neither man planned to fly with Payne  
Stewart. But one boarded the plane and died, and the other didn't, 
living to grieve his friend's death. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Hicks had been Stewart's caddie for 12 years and has flown  
with him many times. 
</P>
<P>
	He was not scheduled to go with Stewart on this flight, although  
his mother said he very easily could have been. 
</P>
<P>
	Hicks learned about the crash while at the Champions Golf Club  
in Houston, where Stewart was to have played this week in the Tour 
Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``I went in and watched television like everyone else. As soon  
as I knew what happened, I left for home,'' he said by telephone. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart, his agents, Robert Fraley and Van Ardan, and the two  
pilots, Michael Kling and Stephanie Bellegarrigue, were killed 
Monday. Their Learjet, on a flight from Orlando to Dallas, flew 
pilotless for 1,400 miles and plunged into a field in South Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
	Golf course architect Bruce Borland is believed to have been a  
sixth passenger. A senior design associate with a firm owned by 
Jack Nicklaus, Borland was scheduled to fly on a commercial plane, 
but apparently got on the plane with Stewart instead. 
</P>
<P>
	Hicks flew home to Mebane with his wife and three children  
instead of flying with Stewart to Texas. His wife, Meg, almost 
balked at the trip because it was a big job traveling with young 
children, Hicks' mother, Faye, said Tuesday by telephone from her 
home in Hillsborough. 
</P>
<P>
	``But she went, and she said she was glad that she did because  
he had to come back with her,'' Mrs. Hicks said. ``Really if she 
hadn't gone he probably would have flown on with Payne. That is 
usually their itinerary, that he flies with him to the next 
tournament from Disney.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hicks said, however, that even if his family had not come to  
Florida, he would not have gone on the ill-fated flight. 
</P>
<P>
	Hicks returned to North Carolina on Sunday and flew to Houston  
on Monday to prepare for the Tour Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Borland didn't plan to be on the flight, but appears to have  
been. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott Tolley, a spokesman for Nicklaus' Golden Bear  
International Inc., said Borland canceled a reservation on a 
commercial flight so he could fly with Stewart and discuss 
developing a golf course in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had the opportunity to fly with Payne, so he drove from  
Jupiter in a rented car,'' Tolley said. While there was no official 
confirmation that Borland was among the crash victims, Tolley said, 
``The family is confident that he boarded the plane.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Borland, 40, of Jupiter, Fla., joined Nicklaus' firm in 1990 and  
was the design associate on the firm's ``Signature'' courses, 
including Colleton River Plantation in Hilton Head, S.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Hicks' mother said her son will be a pallbearer at Stewart's  
funeral, and he and his wife also plan to attend Fraley's services. 
</P>
<P>
	Hicks remembers when Stewart won the 1999 U.S. Open in Pinehurst  
in June and rode home to Mebane with Hicks. The next day, Stewart 
played in a charity tournament Hicks had organized. 
</P>
<P>
	``I live in North Carolina, and we had Payne in our home that  
night. It's one of the moments I'll always remember,'' Hicks said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all drank champagne from the cup. It's a caddie's dream to  
have his boss in his home. I'll bet that doesn't happen too 
often.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Hicks said she doesn't know if her son will want to work  
for another golfer. 
</P>
<P>
	``He lost his best friend,'' Mrs. Hicks said. ``They were best  
buddies.''

<HEADLINE> Labor, Environment Divide WTO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- Key trade ministers meeting in  
preparation for the November round of World Trade Organization 
talks butted heads Tuesday over plans to discuss labor and the 
environment -- with developing nations saying they have little voice 
in setting the agenda. 
</P>
<P>
	``We support an open multilateral trading system, but we have to  
be full partners in the trading system,'' said Egyptian Economy 
Minister Youssef Boutros Ghali, one of 24 trade ministers meeting 
in advance of the November talks. ``There is a new sense of urgency 
among developing countries that we cannot be left out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With just five weeks to go before the 135 members of the global  
trade regulating group meet in Seattle, Boutros Ghali's comments 
underscore the members' division on the issue of requiring poorer 
members to boost labor and environmental standards. 
</P>
<P>
	President Bill Clinton is making the issues a priority for the  
talks, and the United States and European Union see the inclusion 
of labor and environmental standards as essential to maintaining 
public confidence in the global trading system. 
</P>
<P>
	``The core work of the WTO is under attack as anti-environmental  
and as promoting the lowest common denominator with respect to core 
labor standards,'' U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky 
told the assembled ministers. 
</P>
<P>
	Developing countries, which make up the majority of the WTO,  
strongly oppose such discussions, saying they are meant to protect 
industrial countries' markets against cheap imports. They argue 
that labor standards are a matter for the United Nations, not the 
WTO.

<HEADLINE> Lucent Breaking Into Four Divisions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MURRAY HILL, N.J. (AP) -- Lucent Technologies, the world's  
biggest telephone equipment maker, announced better-than-expected 
fourth-quarter profits as it unveiled a plan to restructure into 
four divisions to better focus on high-growth sectors. 
</P>
<P>
	The four new divisions -- Service Provider Networks, Enterprise  
Networks, NetCare Professional Service and Microelectronics and 
Communications Technologies -- are designed to allow the company to 
concentrate on the high-growth areas of optical networking, 
wireless communications, semiconductors and e-business. 
</P>
<P>
	All four divisions will be led by current Lucent executives and  
will operate under the Lucent umbrella. 
</P>
<P>
	With the restructuring comes a shift in personnel.  
</P>
<P>
	Chief operating officer Ben Verwaayen was named vice chairman in  
charge of international business, and Arun Netravali was chosen to 
replace Dan Stanzione as president of Bell Labs, the company's 
research arm. 
</P>
<P>
	Stanzione will serve as advisor to the company's chairman and  
chief executive officer, Richard McGinn. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Holder will oversee staffing and strategy for all four  
divisions. 
</P>
<P>
	Service Provider Networks will work with Internet service  
providers, telephone networks and other communications providers. 
</P>
<P>
	Enterprise Networks, which will consist of Lucent's current  
Business Communication Systems and Government Solutions as well as 
parts of InterNetworking Systems, will be responsible for voice and 
data solutions for small and large businesses, including the 
federal government. 
</P>
<P>
	Netcare Professional Services will be responsible for consulting  
and design and will look at future network possibilities for 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Microelectronics and Communications Technologies will include  
Lucent's microchip business and component equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	Lucent employs more than 150,000 people worldwide, including  
21,000 in New Jersey. The company does not expect layoffs as a 
result of the restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
	Lucent posted profits -- not including one-time expenses  
associated with mergers and acquisitions -- of $972 million, or 31 
cents per share, during the fourth quarter ended Sept. 30, compared 
with $647 million, or 21 cents per share, during the same quarter a 
year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The results topped expectations of analysts surveyed by First  
Call/Thomson Financial, who had been expecting 29 cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	Total revenues during the quarter were up 23 percent to $10.6  
billion from $8.6 billion the year before. 
</P>
<P>
	Lucent's revenue for the fiscal year ending Sept. 30 totaled  
$38.3 billion, a 20 percent increase over the previous year. Annual 
profits were up 46 percent to more than $3.8 billion, or $1.22 per 
share, from $2.6 billion, or 86 cents a share, last year.

<HEADLINE> Pat Buchanan Visits Michigan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MACOMB TOWNSHIP, Mich. (AP) -- On his first full day as a Reform  
Party presidential candidate, Pat Buchanan on Tuesday went straight 
to Macomb County and its coveted voters known as Reagan Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan took his staunch messages of social conservatism and  
America-first military and economic ideology to the suburban 
Detroit county where Ronald Reagan successfully voiced them in 1980 
-- even as voters continued to elect and re-elect Democrats further 
down the ticket. 
</P>
<P>
	Both major parties, however, have failed the American people,  
Buchanan said, echoing remarks he made Monday in announcing he was 
quitting the Republican Party. 
</P>
<P>
	``They pretend to be two separate parties, battling parties. But  
it is a lot like professional wrestling, where one guy wins one 
night and they go on to another town and the other guy wins,'' 
Buchanan told 700 students and teachers and a handful of supporters 
at Lutheran North High School. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a fixed game, a rigged game. ... I don't want to elect  
(Democratic Vice President) Al Gore, but I don't want to elect (GOP 
Texas Gov.) George Bush, either. So I decided I had to run and beat 
'em both.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan was on the attack during virtually the entire 20-minute  
speech, and in his responses to students' questions afterward. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Bush, the front-runner for the Republican presidential  
nomination, was ducking debates with him; poked scornful fun at 
Reform Party founder H. Ross Perot and billionaire developer Donald 
Trump, his potential rival for the Reform nomination; and dismissed 
the theory of evolution as ``preposterous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan reiterated several points made Monday: ending unfair  
trade, foreign aid, military entanglements and other intrusions on 
American sovereignty. 
</P>
<P>
	Evidence that the major parties are too cozy with each other was  
reflected in congressional Republicans' refusal to oppose the 
Clinton administration's attack on Serbia or its promotion of trade 
with China, Buchanan said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They love their office too much,'' Buchanan said of  
Washington's GOP lawmakers. ``They love the power, the perks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked by a student about Trump's critical response to his book,  
``A Republic, Not an Empire,'' Buchanan said: ``He hasn't read my 
book. I'm not sure he read the book he wrote about himself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan drew more laughter from the audience when he described  
a visit with Perot: ``I went down to Texas to see him. I didn't 
come out any smarter than when I went in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Third parties haven't fared well in presidential elections,  
Buchanan admitted: ``I'm not certain we're going to win. I just 
think we can. Everyone is looking around for something fresh and 
different.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan spoke at Lutheran North in 1992, during the first of  
his two campaigns for the GOP nomination. The former CNN co-host 
and former Reagan communications director won more delegates in 
Michigan than in any other state during his failed 1996 campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	He was invited to speak Tuesday by Trish Duke, the mother of  
three Lutheran North graduates and self-described ``stay-at-home 
Christian mom.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There's traditional values here, and I think he respects  
that,'' said Mrs. Duke, of nearby Ray Township. ``I think he's 
espousing the values they've learned at home. He's not afraid to 
say, 'I believe in God.' I have not heard Pat waffle on anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At an evening rally in Warren that following a $100-per-person  
fund-raiser, Buchanan continued his attack on the Republican Party. 
He blasted GOP congressional leaders for refusing to oppose the 
Clinton administration on trade, military and economic issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``They talk about a two-party system,'' he told the audience of  
about 500. ``What we've got is a one-party establishment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking of the Republicans in Washington, ``they won't fight  
and I'm tired of a party that won't fight.''

<HEADLINE> NBC Cruises to Nielsens Victory / TV Ratings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- With the opening of the World Series, a dramatic  
conclusion to a tense baseball playoff and, of course, ``ER,'' NBC 
crushed its competition in last week's television ratings. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC did even better than its previous week, when the network  
registered its best Nielsen Media Research ratings since June 1998. 
On average, NBC had more than 4 million more prime-time viewers 
last week than second-place CBS. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, bad news continued for Fox and the networks began  
bailing out in earnest from the failed shows of the fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Three NBC baseball games finished among the week's 10 most  
popular programs. The final game of the Mets-Braves playoff series 
actually outrated the first two games of the World Series, although 
slightly more people watched the series opening games. Overall, 
World Series ratings are up from last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``ER'' was the week's most popular show, continuing Alan Alda's  
guest starring role. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC's strength on Thursdays has lain waste to competitors. ABC  
has temporarily yanked the drama ``Wasteland'' from its schedule. 
Fox's critically-praised ``Action'' is a thorough disaster, losing 
in the ratings last week to UPN's ``WWF Smackdown!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fox has canceled its entire Friday night lineup, ``Harsh Realm''  
and ``Ryan Caulfield: Year One,'' after they finished Nos. 100 and 
108 in last week's ratings. 
</P>
<P>
	Except for baseball, only ``The Simpsons'' on Fox last week  
rated among the week's top 50 programs. The network's average 
prime-time viewership of 8.6 million people this fall is nearly 2 
million less than last year at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS has axed its Wednesday night comedy, ``Work With Me,'' which  
finished in 68th place last week. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week, NBC had an 11.8 rating and 20 share. CBS had a 9.0  
rating and 15 share, ABC had a 7.2 rating and 12 share and Fox had 
a 5.3 rating and 9 share. The WB had a 3.0 rating and 5 share, UPN 
was at 2.8 and 5, and Pax TV had a 0.8 rating and 1 share. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC's ``Nightly News'' won the evening news ratings race with a  
7.7 rating and 17 share. ABC's ``World News Tonight'' had a 7.3 
rating and 16 share, while the ``CBS Evening News'' had a 6.1 
rating and 13 share. 
</P>
<P>
	A rating point represents 1,008,000 households, or 1 percent of  
the nation's estimated 100.8 million TV homes. The share is the 
percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given show. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week of Oct. 18-24, the top 10 shows, their networks and  
ratings were: 
</P>
<P>
	``ER,'' NBC, 20.1; ``National League Championship Series: N.Y.  
Mets vs. Atlanta,'' NBC, 15.4; ``Frasier,'' NBC, 15.0; ``Friends,'' 
NBC, 15.0; ``World Series Game 2: N.Y. Yankees vs. Atlanta,'' NBC, 
15.0; ``World Series Game 1: N.Y. Yankees vs. Atlanta,'' NBC, 14.2; 
``Touched By an Angel,'' CBS, 13.1; ``CBS Sunday Movie: The Soul 
Collector,'' CBS, 12.4; ``Stark Raving Mad,'' NBC, 12.3. ``60 
Minutes,'' CBS, 12.1 and ``NFL Monday Night Football: Dallas vs. 
N.Y. Giants,'' ABC, 12.1, tied for tenth place.

<HEADLINE> Gray Not Sorry for Rose Interview </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Although NBC's Jim Gray didn't relish his  
confrontation with Pete Rose, he doesn't regret it either. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt I did my job and I did my job well, but it wasn't a  
satisfying feeling to walk away from that,'' the NBC Sports 
reporter said Monday as baseball players and fans debated the 
propriety of his live interview with the fallen star. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC was deluged by complaints from fans in the hours after  
Gray's interview during Sunday's World Series pregame show. It 
centered on Rose's lifetime ban from the sport for gambling, and 
came minutes after Rose was announced as a member of baseball's 
All-Century team. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans seem willing to forgive Rose, speaking out in polls in  
favor of his reinstatement to baseball. He received the longest 
ovation of any baseball hero introduced Sunday at Atlanta's Turner 
Field. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose told Gray he was ``surprised you're bombarding me like  
this'' on a festive occasion. 
</P>
<P>
	Gray said his questions shouldn't have surprised Rose since  
other reporters had asked the same things at a news conference 
shortly before. 
</P>
<P>
	``I tried very hard to be very fair to Pete last night and I  
think I was very fair,'' Gray told reporters. ``The fact that he 
doesn't like it doesn't mean it wasn't fair.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rose wasn't commenting on the dispute Monday. Gray said he'd be  
back on the sidelines reporting Tuesday for Game 3 of the series, 
and he didn't expect to address the controversy. 
</P>
<P>
	Switchboards at NBC affiliates across the country were bombarded  
by phone calls from people angry at Gray -- two hours nonstop at 
WLWT in Cincinnati, where Rose collected most of his record 4,256 
hits for the hometown Reds. 
</P>
<P>
	In an e-mail to The Associated Press, one fan wrote of being  
enraged that Rose was ``blindsided'' during what should have been a 
proud moment, and said it gives the press a bad name. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope NBC buys a collar and leash for the bulldog,'' the  
writer said. 
</P>
<P>
	New York Yankees manager Joe Torre said it was uncalled for.  
``For some reason, we've lost sight of the word `respect.' We deal 
too much in shock value.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We were pretty much all disgusted with Jim,'' Yankees  
outfielder Darryl Strawberry said. ``It was a night of celebration 
for Pete Rose. Every player who ever plays cares about Pete Rose. 
It was embarrassing. It didn't sit too well in this clubhouse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gray's colleague, NBC analyst Joe Morgan, a teammate of Rose's  
with the Cincinnati Reds, was careful not to place the blame on 
either person. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was cringing and hoping that Pete would have the right  
answers,'' Morgan said. ``I was just hoping the interview would be 
over the next second.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some leapt to Gray's defense. ``I thought it was the best TV  
interview I've ever seen,'' said Murray Chass, baseball writer for 
The New York Times. ``It was appropriate. It was not overdone. Rose 
has put himself in position to be pressed like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John Dowd, the investigator whose 1989 probe of Rose led to the  
ban, said he tipped his hat to Gray. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought he had more guts than any guy I've ever seen,'' Dowd  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Former baseball Commissioner Fay Vincent said Gray knows how  
overwhelming the evidence is against Rose. ``For Pete to just stand 
there and look Jim Gray in the eye and deny he bet on baseball, 
it's obviously a challenge that any interviewer can't let go. I 
recognize it was aggressive, but Rose was aggressive.''

<HEADLINE> Internet Shopping Benefits Reviewed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Go online or use the old-fashioned catalog this  
holiday season? 
</P>
<P>
	The Web is preferable only about half the time, despite promises  
of convenience with e-commerce, according to a Consumer Reports 
review of 25 retailers. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey in the November issue of the magazine recommends  
using the Internet to shop at 11 of the stores studied while 
sticking with mail-order catalogs for 12 others. Two retailers 
studied were toss-ups. 
</P>
<P>
	``With few exceptions, both the paper catalogs and the Web sites  
delivered the goods -- as ordered and on time,'' wrote the editors 
of the magazine. ``The shopping experience was another matter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The magazine hits newsstands a week from today. It is published  
by Consumers Union, a nonprofit product tester for more than 60 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer Reports said some of the Internet shopping sites lacked  
information about security, return policies and shipping costs or 
made shopping tedious because of poor organization. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other hand, ``all the paper catalogs were uniformly easy  
to page through and order from -- just what you'd expect from a 
highly refined shopping medium.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That finding came as little surprise to many Internet analysts,  
given that e-commerce is relatively new. 
</P>
<P>
	Clay Ryder, chief analyst with Zona Research Inc. of Redwood  
City, Calif., said Web sites are getting better and may one day 
surpass paper catalogs by offering better guidance and shopping 
tips for individual customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the seven clothing merchants reviewed, J. Crew and Eddie  
Bauer got good marks for their Web sites' ease of use. Lands' End 
made up for inefficient navigation with useful features such as a 
gift finder and reminder. Eddie Bauer also won praise for an e-mail 
gift reminder. 
</P>
<P>
	The magazine, which rated the companies between July and  
September, recommended using mail order for four other clothing 
retailers: L.L. Bean, Victoria's Secret, Frederick's of Hollywood 
and Old Pueblo Traders. 
</P>
<P>
	L.L. Bean has since restructured its site to address what  
spokesman Rich Donaldson said were ``legitimate criticisms'' from 
customers. Frederick's plans changes by Thanksgiving. 
</P>
<P>
	The magazine points out that the information superhighway may  
evolve one day into ``a fine place for at-home shopping.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But for the current holiday season, the magazine offers a few  
tips: Check the Web site's security and privacy policies, and allow 
at least three weeks for the gift to arrive in case of technical 
glitches.

<HEADLINE> Compaq Beats Expectations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Compaq Computer Corp., coming off an executive  
shakeup and more than 7,000 job cuts, reported flat operating 
profits in the third quarter on Tuesday that beat analysts' 
expectations. But revenue fell 2 percent from the second quarter as 
the company lost its U.S. leadership in personal computer sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq, which is still the largest seller of PCs on a worldwide  
basis, reported net income of $140 million, or 8 cents per share, 
compared to results in the year-ago quarter of $115 million, or 7 
cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	But not counting $868 million in charges related to a  
restructuring and a $1.2 billion one-time gain on the sale of its 
AltaVista Internet portal, Compaq earned $117 million, or 7 cents a 
share in the recent quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts polled by First Call/Thomson Financial expected Compaq  
to earn 5 cents per share in the July-September period. The 
results, which were released at the close of financial markets, 
mark a return to profitability after the company's stunning $184 
million in losses last quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq reported revenue of $9.21 billion, up 5 percent from  
$8.79 billion a year ago but down slightly from $9.4 billion last 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael D. Capellas, promoted to president and chief executive  
in July following the ouster of Eckhard Pfeiffer last spring, said 
he was disappointed in revenues but encouraged by a drop in 
operating costs from the second quarter to $1.97 billion from $2.2 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``While our revenue numbers were down sequentially, we achieved  
our earnings per share target, gross margin was up and operating 
expenses were down,'' Capellas said. 
</P>
<P>
	Capellas added that he is satisfied the company, which has  
fallen behind Dell Computer Corp. in U.S. personal computer sales, 
is on track to further streamline its operations while staying 
competitive. 
</P>
<P>
	But Ashok Kumar, an analyst with U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffrey, saw  
little upside in the earnings report. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the earnings are clearly a disappointment. The  
earnings are inflated by accounting,'' Kumar said. ``The key issues 
going forward are the company has completely lost traction in the 
commercial desktop line, the company does not have a strategy for 
its service division ... and because of the deep budget cuts, 
Europe is in complete disarray. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bottom line is there's no catalyst that indicates any  
imminent turnaround.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts have faulted in part Compaq's inability to emulate the  
efficient sales model of Dell and Gateway, which sell products 
directly to customers and avoid retailers and wholesalers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Changes in the personal computer business are not just about  
sales and distribution models,'' Capellas said, adding that Compaq 
is banking on an array of upcoming computer models. ``We intend to 
drive a new generation of products, from desktops to palmtops.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq earned $237 million, or 15 cents per share, in the nine  
months ended Sept. 30. Last year at that time, the company lost 
$3.5 billion, or $2.21 cents per share, stemming from its 
acquisition of Digital. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue rose to $28.05 bill from $20.31 billion.

<HEADLINE> Virgin Atlantic To Appeal Ruling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Virgin Atlantic Airways plans to appeal a U.S.  
federal judge's decision that it failed to provide evidence that 
rival British Airways monopolizes routes between London and the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Virgin Atlantic's chairman Richard Branson said Tuesday he was  
``astounded'' by the decision, noting that the European Commission 
ruled in favor of Virgin in a similar case against British Airways. 
</P>
<P>
	Virgin had argued that BA relies on incentive agreements with  
travel agents and corporate customers to keep passengers flying on 
its transatlantic routes from its hub at London's Heathrow Airport. 
</P>
<P>
	Virgin accused British Airways of damaging competition on routes  
between Heathrow and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	But U.S. District Judge Miriam Goldman Cedarbaum ruled  
otherwise, saying Monday that British Airways ``persuasively 
argues'' that Virgin has not shown proof that BA engaged in 
anticompetitive practices. 
</P>
<P>
	``Judge Cedarbaum accepted our view of the facts and the law in  
this case, but surprisingly felt that we hadn't provided enough 
evidence,'' Branson said in a statement. ``This gives us every 
encouragement to mount an appeal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Virgin aims to file its appeal within the next few days with the  
Court of Appeals in New York, said Virgin spokesman Paul Moore. 
</P>
<P>
	The European Commission, the administrative body for the  
European Union, ruled on July 14 that British Airways had abused 
its dominant position by using a similar incentive program in 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Branson's airline said that the program was designed to put  
maximum pressure on travel agents to give preference to the largest 
carrier in the market, regardless of price, quality of service or 
scheduling. The commission fined BA $6.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Virgin originally filed its anti-trust claims against British  
Airways in 1993. It's seeking damages in the United States of $1 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``After six long years, this is not the end of the road,''  
Branson said.

<HEADLINE> Curtis Refuses To Talk To NBC's Gray </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- NBC reporter Jim Gray apologized to baseball  
fans Tuesday night for his contentious interview with Pete Rose 
before Game 2 of the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC was deluged by complaints from fans Sunday night after  
Gray's interview with Rose at Turner Field in Atlanta. It centered 
on Rose's lifetime ban from the sport for gambling, and came 
minutes after he returned to a major league field for the first 
time in 10 years as a member of baseball's All-Century team. 
</P>
<P>
	During NBC's pregame show Tuesday night at Yankee Stadium, Gray  
spoke of the incident. 
</P>
<P>
	``After viewing the videotape, I can understand the reaction of  
many baseball fans,'' Gray said. ``I thought that it was important 
to ask Pete Rose if this was the right moment for him to make an 
apology. 
</P>
<P>
	``If in doing so, the interview went on too long and took out  
some of the joy of the occasion, then I want to say to baseball 
fans everywhere that I'm very sorry about this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees seemed not to be in a forgiving mood, however. Chad  
Curtis, who hit the game-winning home run in the 10th, refused to 
answer Gray's questions after the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because of what happened with Pete, we decided not to say  
anything,'' Curtis told Gray on live television, adding a greeting 
for his grandmother before walking away. 
</P>
<P>
	Gray shouted after Curtis, ``Don't you want to talk about your  
home run?'' but Curtis did not turn around. 
</P>
<P>
	In its postgame report on CNBC, reporter Craig Sager, who had  
been covering the Braves' dugout, went over to the Yankees' side of 
the field to ask the questions. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans seem willing to forgive Rose, speaking out in polls in  
favor of his reinstatement to baseball. He received the longest 
ovation of any baseball hero introduced Sunday at Atlanta's Turner 
Field. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose told Gray he was ``surprised you're bombarding me like this  
on such a festive occasion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview Monday, Gray said his questions shouldn't have  
surprised Rose since other reporters asked the same things at a 
news conference shortly before. 
</P>
<P>
	Dick Ebersol, chairman of NBC Sports, backed Gray by calling him  
``the best TV sports reporter of his generation.'' However, Ebersol 
said he thought the interview ``probably went too long.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Switchboards at NBC affiliates across the country were bombarded  
by phone calls from people angry at Gray -- two hours nonstop at 
WLWT in Cincinnati, where Rose collected most of his record 4,256 
hits for the hometown Reds. 
</P>
<P>
	Yankees manager Joe Torre said the interview was uncalled-for.  
``For some reason, we've lost sight of the word `respect.' We deal 
too much in shock value.''

<HEADLINE> Vikings Make Roster Moves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDEN PRAIRIE, Minn. (AP) -- The Minnesota Vikings activated  
backup center Corey Withrow from their practice squad Tuesday and 
signed cornerback Carlos Jones to their practice squad. 
</P>
<P>
	Withrow was needed because backup offensive lineman Matt Birk  
fractured his right thumb in Sunday's game against San Francisco. 
Jones, who was drafted in 1997 by Seattle and was in training camp 
with the New Orleans Saints this season, replaces Withrow on the 
practice squad. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones was one of three cornerbacks who worked out with the  
Vikings this week after second-year pro Ramos McDonald was waived.

	Stocks End Mixed; Dow Down 47.80  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks closed mixed today as investors failed to  
shake their nervousness about inflation and interest rates. But 
some big stocks, including Microsoft and Intel, got a boost from 
joining the Dow Jones industrial average. The Dow was down 47.80 at 
10,302.13, having surrendered an earlier 59-point gain. The blue 
chips fell 120 points on Monday amid uneasiness over higher rates. 
Broader stock indicators were mixed, with the Nasdaq composite 
index up 2.73 to 2,818.68. 

</P>
<P>
	Intel, Microsoft Joining Dow  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) Dow Jones &AMP; Co. announced today that Intel and  
Microsoft are being added to the Dow, becoming the first Nasdaq 
stocks ever chosen by The Wall Street Journal for its blue-chip 
index. Retailer Home Depot and the telephone company SBC 
Communications will also join the Dow, replacing Sears Roebuck, 
Goodyear Tire &AMP; Rubber, Chevron and Union Carbide. The changes are 
expected to make the Dow a clearer reflection of the modern 
economy, in which technology has driven growth. The announcement 
boosted the prices of the new Dow stocks during the morning, and 
also lent support to the rest of the market. But by the afternoon, 
worries about interest rates eroded the gains. Intel shares ended 
at 71 7/16, up 3/16. Microsoft ended at 92 3/8, down 1/16.

	Consumer Confidence Drops Sharply  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Consumers aren't as bullish about the stock  
market and the long-running economic expansion these days, with a 
new survey showing confidence dropping sharply in October to extend 
its decline from a 30-year high to four straight months. But the 
Conference Board survey released today also says most Americans 
don't seem ready to scale back their spending yet. That bodes well 
for retailers who are gearing up for the imminent start of the 
holiday shopping season. The Conference Board's index of consumer 
confidence, which is a measure of consumers' willingness to spend, 
fell to 130.1 in October from a revised 134.2 in September. The 
drop in confidence was greater than analysts had expected.

The union said 85 percent of the workers who voted approved the 
deal. The contract mirrors many of the terms agreed to by General 
Motors Corp. and DaimlerChrysler AG -- 3 percent raises each year, a 
$1,350 signing bonus and improvements in pensions. It also 
guarantees Ford jobs for about 23,500 workers in parts plants even 
if Ford turns its Visteon Automotive Systems parts division into a 
separate company.

new group, the Coalition of Professional Flight Attendants, said 
the Machinists union failed them at the bargaining table in this 
summer's contract talks. ``It's TWA flight attendants who know TWA 
flight attendant issues,'' said Flip Becker, one of the group's 
organizers. ``We can best represent ourselves.'' Two weeks ago, 
mechanics at TWA gathered to announce their campaign to decertify 
the IAM. The mechanics, like the flight attendants, complained that 
the labor agreements the IAM negotiated this summer were tilted too 
heavily in favor of baggage handlers and other ``ramp'' workers.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Scolds Afghanistan's Rulers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A day after rulers in Afghanistan showed  
interest in working with U.S. officials to turn over a terrorist 
kingpin, President Clinton denounced the Taliban for its treatment 
of women. 
</P>
<P>
	``Perhaps the most difficult place for women in the world today  
is still Afghanistan,'' the president said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, a representative of the Taliban met with a ranking  
State Department official to discuss how Afghanistan, which is 
facing U.N. sanctions, could improve its situation. 
</P>
<P>
	No accord was reached, but the contact suggested that the  
Taliban was at least willing to consider expelling Osma bin Laden, 
who is accused of masterminding attacks on two U.S. embassies in 
Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	Secretary of State Madeleine Albright went so far as to suggest  
in a news conference that the ruling militia had a chance at being 
accorded regular treatment by nations around the world if it 
expelled bin Laden. But Albright also has denounced the Taliban for 
``despicable'' repression of women. 
</P>
<P>
	Since gaining power, the Taliban have forced women from jobs,  
closed schools for girls and made it mandatory for women to wear 
the all-enveloping burqa. Women also are not allowed to travel 
without a male relative. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton didn't address the bin Laden situation Tuesday, but he  
made clear his disdain for the Taliban's treatment of women. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope the fact that ... we continue to push for changes in  
the lives of those people and take as many in as we can here will 
some day lead to a change in that country,'' Clinton said. 
``Because no one should have to undergo what those women have 
experienced.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president spoke out at an East Room ceremony honoring  
photographer Annie Leibovitz and recognizing the work of The Vital 
Voices Global Partnership, which supports economic and political 
empowerment for women. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and Albright spoke to  
the gathering, held to highlight an exhibition of Leibovitz' photos 
hanging at the nearby Corcoran Gallery of Art. 
</P>
<P>
	The exhibition and an accompanying book, titled ``Women,''  
examine the accomplishments of women in the 20th century through 
portraits of female coal miners, judges, writers and other 
professionals. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also opened up a bit about how he views reporters and  
photographers who cover him. 
</P>
<P>
	He told a crowd of more than 700 people that his staff sometime  
teases him becaues he's ``always comparing the job of photographer 
in Washington with the job of a reporter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``In some ways, the job of a photographer is easy because a  
photographer is rewarded just for looking to see what is there and 
capture it in some remarkable, clear crystal way,'' he said. ``The 
poor reporters and columnists have to perform reverse plastic 
surgery on the event to get any notice whatever.''

	Cabinet Named by Indonesian Leader  
</P>
<P>
	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- New President Abdurrahman Wahid said  
on Tuesday that he hopes the public find the choices for his 
Cabinet, being touted as corruption free, as ``very satisfactory.'' 
The new lineup lessens the military's once-powerful political role 
and signals a change of emphasis in foreign and economic policy. 
There also is wide representation of Indonesia's ethnic diversity 
at a time of growing discontent in the sprawling archipelago's 
outer regions. After expectations of a much leaner Cabinet, the 
35-minister lineup was only one smaller than the 36-member group 
that served under former President B.J. Habibie.

	Stewart's Plane May Have Depressurized  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The initial information known about the crash  
of golfer Payne Stewart's jet points to a sudden loss of 
pressurization in the ``very hostile'' environment of high-altitude 
flight. Experienced pilots say such an occurrence is extremely rare 
for civilian aircraft -- and very unforgiving. It could have been 
brought on by a blown door or window seal. Experts interviewed 
after Monday's crash considered that the most likely scenario 
because the two pilots and at least three passengers aboard 
Stewart's Lear 35 did not broadcast a mayday before the plane 
crashed in South Dakota. All aboard died.

	Justice Department Drops Reno Case  
</P>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- The Justice Department dropped its efforts  
to deport a Palestinian immigrant suspected of plotting to kill 
Attorney General Janet Reno. The decision, announced about an hour 
before a midnight deadline, led to the immediate release of Hany 
Mahmoud Kiareldeen, who had been jailed for 19 months on the basis 
of allegations in secret evidence. Immigration judges this month 
found that evidence ``unreliable'' and a federal judge ruled last 
week it was unconstitutional. Kiareldeen, 31, who managed a Passaic 
electronics shop before his detention on charges he overstayed his 
student visa, was never charged with a terrorist act.

	Israelis Open Safe Passage Route  
</P>
<P>
	EREZ CROSSING, Gaza Strip (AP) -- Hundreds of eager Palestinians  
shouldering duffel bags and suitcases traveled 28 miles across 
Israel on Monday -- inaugurating a ``safe passage'' that for the 
first time links the areas under their control and takes them a 
step closer to statehood. The safe passage between the Erez 
Crossing in Gaza to Tarkumiya in the West Bank takes the 
Palestinians a step closer to statehood by linking the two 
autonomous areas on either side of Israel that they hope will 
eventually make up their state.

	Talks on bin Laden Moving Ahead  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Taliban militia in Afghanistan is  
responding to U.S. demands for the expulsion of suspected terrorist 
kingpin Osama bin Laden with ``some ideas,'' the State Department 
says. But, department spokesman James P. Rubin said Monday, ``I 
can't say what the outcome will be.'' Rubin spoke after a Taliban 
representative met with Karl Inderfurth, an assistant secretary of 
state, for a little more than an hour. There was no claim of 
progress on the U.S. side, and the Taliban made no statement as it 
searched for a way to head off U.N. sanctions that would include a 
freeze on assets and a boycott of Afghanistan's airline.

	Ala. Chain Gang Revival Ends  
</P>
<P>
	MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) -- Alabama's revival of the chain gang has  
ended after four years because the state can't spare enough guards 
for the work. State prison officials quietly ended the practice of 
sending out shackled road crews under guard earlier this month, 
saying corrections officers could be put to better use behind 
prison walls. Department of Corrections spokesman Tom Gilkeson said 
Monday the financially strapped department needs 300 additional 
officers inside its lockups and cannot spare employees to accompany 
medium-security inmates on roadsides. ``We didn't have enough 
people for it,'' Gilkeson said.

	Gray Not Sorry for Rose Interview  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- NBC's Jim Gray didn't relish his verbal  
confrontation with Pete Rose, but he doesn't regret it, either. ``I 
felt I did my job and I did my job well, but it wasn't a satisfying 
feeling to walk away from that,'' the NBC Sports reporter said 
Monday as baseball players and fans debated the propriety of his 
live interview with the fallen star. NBC was deluged by complaints 
from fans in the hours after Gray's interview during Sunday's World 
Series pregame show. It centered on Rose's lifetime ban from the 
sport for gambling and came minutes after Rose was announced as a 
member of baseball's All-Century team.

<HEADLINE> Gore Still Has Work Cut Out for Him </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- With an edge in national polls and a  
folksier approach to campaigning, Al Gore's political team believes 
he has stopped his slide in the Democratic presidential contest. 
</P>
<P>
	Trouble is, he hasn't gained ground against rival Bill Bradley  
where it counts -- early primary states like New Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't seen a major qualitative or quantitative shift in  
terms of how his campaign is doing here,'' said Clark Hubbard, 
political science professor at the University of New Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore and Bradley campaigned lightly in New Hampshire on Tuesday,  
spending the bulk of their day closeted with consultants to prepare 
for their first head-to-head contest. The pair will participate in 
a televised forum Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The vice president hopes to produce further evidence that his  
campaign has stopped hemorrhaging. After squandering huge leads in 
national and state polls, Gore shook up his campaign Sept. 29: He 
moved his headquarters to Tennessee, weeded out half of his senior 
staff and jazzed up his public speaking style. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the change:  
</P>
<P>
	--Gore and Bradley delivered back-to-back addresses to Iowa  
Democrats. The vice president fed the partisan crowd raw-meat 
attacks on Republicans and thinly veiled criticisms of Bradley. It 
was a Gore-friendly crowd, and he took advantage of it. 
</P>
<P>
	--The influential AFL-CIO endorsed Gore, despite heavy lobbying  
by Bradley aides. 
</P>
<P>
	--New Hampshire Gov. Jeanne Shaheen endorsed the vice president.  
</P>
<P>
	--Two national polls suggested that Gore is widening his lead  
over Bradley and closing his deficit to Republican front-runner 
George W. Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	A USA Today/CNN/Gallup poll published Tuesday showed that  
Democrats preferred Gore over Bradley 57 percent to 32 percent. Two 
weeks ago, the margin was 51-39. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore widened his lead by improving his image among voters who  
said they are independent, but inclined to vote Democratic. In 
early October, Bradley held a slim lead among those voters; Gore 
now leads in the category by more than 20 points. 
</P>
<P>
	That could spell trouble for Bradley, whose strength in polls  
has come from his strong drawing power with independents. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we should be getting bogged down in daily and  
weekly things like polls,'' said Bradley spokesman Tony Wyche. ``We 
should be focused on issues more important to the American 
people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't take any satisfaction'' in the polls, Gore said.  
``They're just snapshots.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If the numbers suggest a trend, it hasn't been duplicated in  
Iowa, New Hampshire or New York. Bradley is still tied with Gore in 
those early primary states. 
</P>
<P>
	``The candidate is different than he was six weeks ago and  
that's why the national numbers are different,'' said former White 
House aide Rahm Emanuel, a Gore ally. ``Like all things, there is a 
delayed reaction and that will become apparent in the upcoming Iowa 
and New Hampshire numbers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The New Al Gore -- even some of his advisers call him that --  
rarely speaks from behind a lectern, rarely uses notes and is more 
prone to drop by a diner and chat with voters than ever before. 
</P>
<P>
	He is holding informal forums with voters, taking questions on  
UFOs and vagaries of the local tax system. ``What grade are you 
in?'' a 16-year-old jokingly asked Gore on Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm in the seventh year of my vice presidency,'' Gore replied  
without missing a beat. ``And I'm ready to graduate. I hope I do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shaheen, who engineered Gary Hart's 1984 New Hampshire primary  
upset, said she had urged Gore's campaign to loosen up earlier this 
year. Her advice went unheeded for weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``From the beginning, my idea of how to run for president in New  
Hampshire is to run from the grassroots. Sometimes people are not 
always willing to hear that,'' she said in an interview in her 
Statehouse office. 
</P>
<P>
	At an anti-drug rally, Shaheen helped Gore stretch a swath of  
red plastic around the Statehouse on Tuesday. He is still not a 
perfect candidate: Despite the gold dome and the presence of 
several state officials, Gore kept calling the Capitol ``the 
courthouse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got to say, he seems more at ease with himself,'' said  
Linda Ribolini, a Democratic voter from Amherst. ``I think people 
will start feeling like he's one of them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tim Chrysostom, a Democrat from Canterbury, said he likes Gore  
but is leaning toward Bradley because the former New Jersey senator 
would do better in the general election. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bradley is not connected to Bill Clinton,'' he said. ``And he  
doesn't look so political.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shaheen said time will pluck the bloom off Bradley's rose.  
</P>
<P>
	``There is an initial reaction because he is a fresh face, but  
it's too early to see whether that translates into real votes,'' 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Others wonder whether primary voters will welcome the changes in  
Gore -- or view them as a political stunt. 
</P>
<P>
	``He actually does seem to be coming along as a retail  
candidate. His people skills are better. He looks better. He sounds 
better,'' said Hubbard, the political science professor. ``I think 
that means he has good handlers, frankly.''

<HEADLINE> U.S.-Taiwan Security Expansion Eyed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A House committee moved Tuesday to expand  
U.S.-Taiwan security ties and send a clear message to China that 
the United States would respond to aggression against Taiwan. The 
Clinton administration said the measure could worsen tensions 
across the Taiwan Strait. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Taiwan Security Enhancement Act,'' approved 32-6 by the  
International Relations Committee, would increase training 
operations and exchanges between the two militaries and establish 
lines of communications during crises. It also states that it is in 
America's national interest to make clear that the United States 
will protect Taiwan from outside coercion and force. 
</P>
<P>
	In Taiwan, the committee's vote made the front pages of most of  
the island's major newspapers Wednesday and morning newscasts 
provided extensive coverage of the debate. But a spokesman for 
Taiwan's Ministry of National Defense said it was too early to 
comment on a bill yet to be debated in the full House. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation was modified considerably from the original bill  
by Rep. Tom DeLay, R-Texas, which would have authorized the sale of 
specific weapons to Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Clinton administration still criticized the measure.  
</P>
<P>
	``These types of changes can be particularly destabilizing given  
the current environment,'' Assistant Secretary of State Stanley 
Roth told reporters, saying it could ultimately undermine Taiwan's 
security. 
</P>
<P>
	Several Republicans who worked to modify the original bill, Asia  
subcommittee chairman Doug Bereuter, R-Neb., and Matt Salmon, 
R-Ariz., also cautioned against upsetting the delicate 
U.S.-China-Taiwan balance. ``We should not underestimate the 
sensitivity of U.S.-China relations when it comes to Taiwan,'' 
Bereuter said. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation is an outgrowth of Chinese hostility toward  
democratic changes in Taiwan, a strong anti-China drift in Congress 
and Republican criticisms that the administration has sacrificed 
Taiwan's interests to maintain stable relations with Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are troubled by the Clinton administration's handling of  
Taiwan policy,'' said Committee Chairman Ben Gilman, R-N.Y., citing 
its unwillingness to sell Taiwan some defensive weapons systems and 
talk of a ``strategic partnership'' with Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
	But in a sometimes raucous debate, Democrats on both sides of  
the measure defended the administration's Taiwan policy, including 
the decision to send U.S. aircraft carriers into the region after 
China in 1996 test-fired missiles in the Taiwan Strait. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no doubt in my mind that this is politically designed  
to embarrass the administration,'' Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., said 
of the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	Kurt Campbell, a senior Pentagon adviser on Asia who was called  
out of the audience by Gilman to answer questions during the 
committee debate, dodged queries on whether the United States had 
refused to provide Taiwan with missile defense systems. Such 
matters should be discussed only in closed session, Campbell said, 
but he said the administration had made ``extra efforts'' in recent 
years to ensure that Taiwan had adequate defenses. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act, passed after the United  
States cut diplomatic ties with Taiwan and formed relations with 
China, the United States is committed to helping Taiwan secure its 
self-defense. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. stance has long been that reunification of China and  
Taiwan, which China considers a breakaway province, must only occur 
by peaceful means and that China would face grave consequences if 
it tries to take Taiwan by force. The United States, meanwhile, has 
warned Taiwan not to take pro-independence positions that might 
provoke Chinese aggression. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Clinton administration CIA Director R. James Woolsey  
supports making U.S. military support for Taiwan more clear-cut. On 
Tuesday, he accused the administration of appeasement toward China. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure now moves to the full House. Similar legislation has  
been introduced in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	----	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is H.R. 1838.

<HEADLINE> Nebraska Coach Tones Down Comments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) -- The two days since Nebraska lost to Texas  
gave Cornhuskers coach Frank Solich a chance to cool off a bit. 
</P>
<P>
	During his weekly television show on Sunday night, Solich didn't  
hold back about a couple of calls officials made during Texas' 
24-14 win. In particular Solich was upset about an apparent hold 
not called during the winning touchdown play and an incomplete pass 
Solich said clearly was a catch. 
</P>
<P>
	Words like ``horrendous'' and ``ridiculous'' popped out in  
Solich's comments about the plays during the program. His words 
when asked about the plays after practice Monday were a little more 
subdued, but still critical. Solich appeared to have vented by the 
time his weekly news conference rolled around Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would rather not comment on officiating. It appears that  
I've done quite a bit in the last two days,'' Solich said with a 
chuckle. 
</P>
<P>
	Solich wanted to be clear that he never blamed the loss on the  
officiating. He said the bottom line was Texas won because 
quarterback Major Applewhite had an excellent second half, going 
8-of-9 for 166 yards and two touchdowns. There were also three 
Nebraska turnovers, including two fumbles inside the Texas 20. 
</P>
<P>
	``Understand where we're coming from. Certainly Texas deserved  
to win the ball game because they made the plays in the second half 
that they needed to make to win,'' Solich said. ``With that in 
mind, that one's gone and we are now moving on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But not before pointing out the calls to the Big 12 office.  
Solich said every week each team puts together a video package of 
calls coaches thought were questionable and sends it to the league 
office in Dallas. This week's package from Lincoln will likely 
include Applewhite's final touchdown pass, where Nebraska rover 
Mike Brown appeared to have his jersey tugged on while he was going 
after tight end Mike Jones, who scored on the 17-yard play. 
</P>
<P>
	On Nebraska's final drive, Eric Crouch scrambled on a  
third-and-long and threw across the field to Matt Davison, who 
dived for the ball at the Texas 34. Solich said the receiver caught 
it, but it was ruled incomplete. Nebraska got a first down because 
the officials ruled Davison was interfered with on the play, giving 
the Huskers a first down at the Texas 49. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if the Big 12 agrees the calls were wrong, it will have no  
effect on Saturday's outcome. 
</P>
<P>
	Solich said he was upset when he did his television show.  
</P>
<P>
	``In all honesty, my initial reaction when I did my TV show, it  
was a reaction,'' Solich said. ``My response yesterday was just a 
response to questions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Big 12 has a policy against coaches speaking out against  
officiating. Punishments can range from a public reprimand to a 
suspension and fine. It was not clear Tuesday whether Solich would 
face disciplinary action from the conference. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cornhuskers (6-1, 3-1), who fell from third into a tie for  
No. 8 in the AP Top 25, visit Kansas on Saturday. Solich said the 
team has done a good job of regrouping and is treating it like any 
other game. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were just so many things that all of us could have done  
better,'' Solich said. ``We'll set out to try to make some of those 
corrections.''

<HEADLINE> Designer Planned Work With Stewart  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JUPITER, Fla. (AP) -- Golf course architect Bruce Borland, a  
senior design associate with a firm owned by Jack Nicklaus, planned 
to spend a flight to Dallas getting to know a potential new 
partner, Payne Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, he is believed to have perished with Stewart and four  
others aboard the flight Monday, that took a ghostly path without 
anyone at the controls from Florida to a swampy field in South 
Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
	Borland, 40, of Jupiter, was accompanying Stewart to discuss a  
deal for Nicklaus Design, according to a statement from the 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel terrible that the two will not get that opportunity to  
work together because Bruce was not only a wonderfully talented 
designer but a wonderful person,'' Nicklaus said. 
</P>
<P>
	After hearing of the crash, Borland's wife, Kate, called the  
private jet terminal in Orlando from where it departed and talked 
to an employee who greeted her husband that morning. While there 
was no official confirmation Tuesday that Borland was on board, 
Scott Tolley, a spokesman for Nicklaus' Golden Bear International 
Inc., said the family was confident Borland did board. 
</P>
<P>
	Borland graduated from the University of Illinois in 1981 and  
quickly distinguished himself as a cutting-edge designer. He's 
credited with being among the first to use computers to design golf 
courses. 
</P>
<P>
	He joined Nicklaus' firm in 1990 and was the design associate on  
the firm's ``Signature'' courses, including Colleton River 
Plantation in Hilton Head, S.C. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bruce Borland has been with me for almost 10 years,'' Nicklaus  
said. ``In that time, we've done a lot of golf courses together, 
and we've traveled together, and we've had a great deal of fun 
together. He was simply a terrific addition to our company, and a 
good friend.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was not immediately known that Borland was on the flight  
because his name was not included in the flight plan. He drove to 
Orlando on Monday morning to catch the flight. 
</P>
<P>
	Borland was survived by his wife, Kate, and four children,  
Daniel, 13, Thomas, 12, Benjamin, 10, and Elizabeth, 8. 
</P>
<P>
	Also killed were Stewart's agents, Robert Fraley and Van Ardan,  
and the two pilots, Michael Kling, 43, and Stephanie Bellegarrigue, 
27.

<HEADLINE> Senator Questions Navy Deployment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate will hold an emergency hearing to  
question deployment of a Navy battle group to the Mediterranean if 
the ships are not allowed to undergo live-fire training in Puerto 
Rico, the Senate Armed Services Committee chairman said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Congress is not going to sit by'' while American military men  
and women head into the field unprepared for battle, Sen. John 
Warner told the Joint Chiefs of Staff. 
</P>
<P>
	Gen. Henry Shelton, the Joint Chiefs chairman, repeated the  
military's contention that the Puerto Rican island of Viequez is 
the only site available for Atlantic fleet combined training of 
air, sea and land forces with live bombs. 
</P>
<P>
	As the battle group led by the aircraft carrier USS Eisenhower  
undergoes other training in the region, the Pentagon is weighing a 
decision on whether to continue using Viequez over the protests of 
Puerto Rican authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if Congress is not in session when a decision is made on  
deployment of the Eisenhower battle group, Warner told Shelton he 
would call a special hearing to ``evaluate your professional 
judgment on the readiness of that battle group.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Navy concern over preparedness is heightened by the fact that  
the last two aircraft carriers deployed from the Atlantic Fleet 
ended up participating in combat operations. The USS Enterprise 
engaged in attacks against Iraq from the Persian Gulf and the USS 
Theodore Roosevelt flew combat missions in Kosovo from the 
Mediterranean. 
</P>
<P>
	The Navy suspended training on its Viequez range after protests  
over the death of a civilian guard, David Sanes Rodriguez, in a 
bombing accident on the island April 19. 
</P>
<P>
	A Pentagon-appointed panel concluded that the Navy should resume  
limited training but phase out use of the range over five years. 
Training remains suspended, however, pending a decision by Defense 
Secretary William Cohen and President Clinton. Puerto Rican demand 
that the facility be returned for civilian use. The island has 
9,400 civilian residents. 
</P>
<P>
	Shelton said personnel with the Eisenhower, scheduled to be in  
the Mediterranean in December, could not be prepared with a high 
level of confidence unless they can conduct training that simulates 
real-life situations. 
</P>
<P>
	The Navy said earlier the ships would be in ``a significant  
reduced state of readiness'' if crews could not undergo the 
realistic training. The battle group steamed out of Norfolk, Va., a 
month ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``We should not deploy under those conditions,'' Shelton said.  
But he stopped short of saying he would not deploy if the forces do 
not receive the Vieques training. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is time for the Puerto Rican government to sit down with  
the Department of Defense'' to see where accommodations can be 
made, he said.

<HEADLINE> Caddie Stayed Behind, Designer Went  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Neither man planned to fly with Payne  
Stewart. But one boarded the plane and died, and the other didn't, 
living to grieve his friend's death. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Hicks had been Stewart's caddie for 12 years. He probably  
would have been a passenger on that doomed flight had not his 
family accompanied him from their home in Mebane to Orlando, Fla., 
for the Disney tournament last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Hicks learned about the crash while at the Champions Golf Club  
in Houston, where Stewart was to have played this week at the Tour 
Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``I went in and watched television like everyone else. As soon  
as I knew what happened, I left for home,'' he said by telephone. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart, his agents, Robert Fraley and Van Ardan, and the two  
pilots, Michael Kling and Stephanie Bellegarrigue were killed 
Monday. Their Learjet, on a flight from Orlando to Dallas, flew 
pilotless for 1,400 miles and plunged into a field in South Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
	Golf course architect Bruce Borland is believed to have been a  
sixth passenger. A senior design associate with a firm owned by 
Jack Nicklaus, Borland was scheduled to fly on a commercial plane, 
but apparently got on the plane with Stewart instead. 
</P>
<P>
	Hicks flew home with his wife and three children instead of  
flying with Stewart to Texas. His wife, Meg, almost balked at the 
trip because it was a big job traveling with young children, Hicks' 
mother, Faye, said Tuesday by telephone from her home in 
Hillsborough. 
</P>
<P>
	``But she went, and she said she was glad that she did because  
he had to come back with her,'' Mrs. Hicks said. ``Really if she 
hadn't gone he probably would have flown on with Payne. That is 
usually their itinerary, that he flies with him to the next 
tournament from Disney.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, Hicks returned to North Carolina on Sunday and flew to  
Houston on Monday to prepare for the Tour Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Borland didn't plan to be on the flight, but appears to have  
been. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott Tolley, a spokesman for Nicklaus' Golden Bear  
International Inc., said Borland canceled a reservation on a 
commercial flight so he could fly with Stewart and discuss 
developing a golf course in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had the opportunity to fly with Payne, so he drove from  
Jupiter in a rented car,'' Tolley said. While there was no official 
confirmation that Borland was among the crash victims, Tolley said, 
``The family is confident that he boarded the plane.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Borland, 40, of Jupiter, Fla., joined Nicklaus' firm in 1990 and  
was the design associate on the firm's ``Signature'' courses, 
including Colleton River Plantation in Hilton Head, S.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Hicks' mother said her son will be a pallbearer at Stewart's  
funeral, and he and his wife also plan to attend Fraley's services. 
</P>
<P>
	Hicks remembers when Stewart won the 1999 U.S. Open in Pinehurst  
in June and rode home to Mebane with Hicks. The next day, Stewart 
played in a charity tournament Hicks had organized. 
</P>
<P>
	``I live in North Carolina, and we had Payne in our home that  
night. It's one of the moments I'll always remember,'' Hicks said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all drank champagne from the cup. It's a caddie's dream to  
have his boss in his home. I'll bet that doesn't happen too 
often.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Hicks said she doesn't know if her son will want to work  
for another golfer. 
</P>
<P>
	``He lost his best friend,'' Mrs. Hicks said. ``They were best  
buddies.''

<HEADLINE> Yanks' Knoblauch Delivers Big Blow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Chuck Knoblauch can't find first base, but  
game-tying World Series homers appear easy. 
</P>
<P>
	For the second straight year, Knoblauch hit one, delivering a  
two-run homer in the eighth inning Tuesday night and the New York 
Yankees came back to beat the Atlanta Braves 6-5 in 10 innings to 
take a 3-0 Series lead. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it's a pattern, I hope it continues tomorrow,'' Knoblauch  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Knoblauch has been the focus of a lot of attention this  
postseason, but not for anything positive. Instead, all people want 
to talk to him about are his throws. 
</P>
<P>
	Knoblauch made 26 errors, most by a second baseman this year and  
most by a Yankee since third baseman Graig Nettles had 26 in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think enough has been said about it and it needs to be put  
to bed,'' Knoblauch said. ``I can't control what people talk about 
and say about me. All I can control is go out and work hard and 
focus on every play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He made 14 throwing errors and every throw to first is an  
adventure. There are the lollipop ones that take an eternity to 
reach first base, the sidearm ones that put fans near the 
first-base dugout in danger and even underhanded tosses that make 
people laugh. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any way I make a play is good,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	There are also the clutch home runs.  
</P>
<P>
	In Game 1 of the World Series last year against San Diego,  
Knoblauch hit a game-tying three-run homer in the seventh inning 
off Donne Wall that helped start the Yankees on the way to a sweep. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday night, he did it in the eighth inning against Tom  
Glavine. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has such command. He'll lull you to sleep -- away, away,  
away,'' Knoblauch said. ``I just wanted to react to this ball. On 
2-0, I was just ready for anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Knoblauch has often been criticized in his two years in New York  
for using an uppercut swing for the fences instead trying to hit 
line drives. 
</P>
<P>
	This time it worked.  
</P>
<P>
	With the Yankees trailing 5-3 with Joe Girardi on first,  
Knoblauch hit a high fly to right. Brian Jordan went back to the 
fence and leaped to make the catch. The ball deflected off his 
glove and over the fence. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew I hit it pretty good,'' Knoblauch said. ``Jordan's a  
great outfielder. He jumped, and I prayed. I got a break.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Knoblauch held the bat as he jogged toward first base and the  
ball carried over the wall. He dropped his bat and rounded the 
bases. His teammates, who have stuck by him during his struggles in 
the field, poured out of the dugout to greet him. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees eventually won it in the 10th inning on Chad Curtis'  
second solo homer. But Knoblauch made it possible.

<HEADLINE> Clementes Dispute All-Century Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Roberto Clemente's family is angry he wasn't  
voted to baseball's All-Century team, and commissioner Bud Selig 
didn't rule out the possibility he could be added. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Hispanic community is in an uproar,'' Roberto Clemente Jr.  
said Tuesday night before the third game of the World Series. ``I 
hope they won't boycott baseball, because that is something I have 
some difficulty with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His brother, Luis, said there has been talk in the Hispanic  
community -- from phone calls in Puerto Rico to e-mail to the 
Roberto Clemente Web site -- of a possible boycott of MasterCard, 
the All-Century team's sponsor. Luis Clemente said his mother, 
Vera, also was surprised. The entire family spoke before the game 
in presenting this year's Roberto Clemente Award to San Diego 
outfielder Tony Gwynn. 
</P>
<P>
	``My mother's comments were she was very sad to watch all the  
other players from the same era walking around the stage before the 
game and she felt worse when he was not even mentioned.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clemente, who died in a plane crash on Dec. 31, 1972,  
accompanying relief supplies to Nicaragua following an earthquake, 
finished 10th in fan voting for outfielders. Nine outfielders were 
voted to the squad, and Stan Musial, who finished 11th in voting, 
was among the five players added by a special panel. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemente won 12 Gold Gloves and four batting titles and played  
in 12 straight All-Star games, finishing with a .317 average, 3,000 
hits and 240 home runs. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no question on my mind that he deserved to be on the  
team,'' Selig said. ``However, we opened it up for voting and 
that's the way the votes came down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He added there was a chance of expanding the team.  
</P>
<P>
	``I understand the feeling about Roberto Clemente,'' Selig said.  
``I really don't disagree with it, to be perfectly blunt about it. 
But once you start doing that, you've got some other people who 
feel they should be on it, too. So it's something that we certainly 
can talk about in the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball spokesman Rich Levin said fans and the panel, not the  
commissioner's office, picked the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you take a step back, MasterCard had no involvement with  
the selection of the original 100 players on the ballot or the 
30-man team, either the ones elected by the fans or the ones chosen 
by the panel,'' company spokesman Chris O'Neill said. 
</P>
<P>
	Filmmaker Spike Lee, standing near the Clemente brothers on the  
field, said the omission of their father was a ``mockery,'' a 
``fiasco'' and a ``boondoggle.''

<HEADLINE> Hastert Urges Moseley-Braun Hearing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Speaker Dennis Hastert said Tuesday that  
fellow Illinoisan Carol Moseley-Braun should at least get a hearing 
on her nomination to be New Zealand ambassador, despite a key 
Senate Republican's suggestion he intends to block her from filling 
the post. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Jesse Helms, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations  
Committee, told a reporter from the Capitol Hill newspaper Roll 
Call that the former Democratic senator's nomination had little 
chance and that he would require her to apologize for a speech she 
made in 1993 criticizing the Confederate flag. Moseley-Braun was 
the first black woman ever to serve in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	That emotional speech by Moseley-Braun was credited with sinking  
Helms-sponsored legislation that would have granted the United 
Daughters of the Confederacy a renewed patent on an insignia 
featuring the original Confederate flag. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, Helms, R-N.C., issued a statement saying his concern with  
Moseley-Braun's nomination came from ``serious charges of ethical 
misconduct'' in her past. He suggested his panel would scrutinize 
allegations against her, such as never-proven ones that she used 
1993 campaign funds to pay for personal luxuries and criticism of 
her 1996 trip to a Nigerian dictator. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite Helms' promise that Moseley-Braun would get her day  
before his committee, he has yet to schedule a hearing. With the 
congressional session soon drawing to a close for the year, Senate 
confirmation of this year seems unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
	While refusing to criticize Helms' treatment of Moseley-Braun,  
Hastert, R-Ill., said she should be allowed to make the case for 
her nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	``She deserves a fair hearing,'' Hastert said in a Washington  
interview with home-state reporters. ``But there are some questions 
out there. Honestly, those questions ought to be answered.''

<HEADLINE> Selig Says Rose Will Not Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The fans have spoken, and Bud Selig says it  
makes no difference: Pete Rose isn't coming back to baseball, not 
as long as he's commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
	Selig was in the stands Sunday night and heard the 55-second  
ovation for the banned career hits leader, the longest ovation for 
any of the 30 members of the All-Century team. 
</P>
<P>
	``That certainly can't influence your decision,'' Selig said  
Tuesday night before Game 3 of the World Series. ``In life, you 
have to do what you think is right -- as Bart did, as other 
commissioners did. ... You can't be governed by what you think a 
number of people feel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Following an investigation of Rose's gambling 10 years ago, the  
Cincinnati Reds manager agreed to a lifetime ban from baseball. 
Rose applied for reinstatement in September 1997, but Selig has not 
yet made a formal ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Selig hasn't hidden his feelings on the matter, saying  
he's seen no new evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Bart Giamatti decision was very clear and very lucid on  
all points,'' Selig said. ``I've made my feelings well known over 
the past year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As long as Rose remains on the permanently banned list, he is  
ineligible for the Hall of Fame ballot. Selig said he sees no 
reason for a compromise decision in which Rose could enter the Hall 
but still remain banned from baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	``These kind of situations in life really don't call for a  
middle grounds decision,'' Selig said. 
</P>
<P>
	Selig said he didn't second-guess himself for inviting Rose to  
participate in the ceremony with the other 17 living members of the 
team, but he didn't want to get into the debate on Jim Gray's 
controversial interview with Rose on NBC after the ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're always better off when the focus of the game is on the  
field, not on us,'' Selig said. ``But no one ever said life is 
simple, and this proves that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``After viewing the videotape, I can understand the reaction of  
many baseball fans,'' Gray said before NBC's telecast of Game 3 of 
the World Series on Tuesday night. ``I thought that it was 
important to ask Pete Rose if this was the right moment for him to 
make an apology. 
</P>
<P>
	``If in doing so, the interview went on too long and took out  
some of the joy of the occasion, then I want to say to baseball 
fans everywhere that I'm very sorry about this.''

	Yanks Win Game 3 of World Series  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Chad Curtis hit his second home run leading off  
the 10th inning tonight and the New York Yankees beat the Atlanta 
Braves 6-5 to move within one victory of a World Series sweep. In 
the best-of-7 Fall Classic, the Yanks lead 3-0. Curtis had homered 
in the fifth inning to begin New York's comeback from a 5-1 
deficit. Yankee homers by Tino Martinez and Chuck Knoblauch off 
Braves starter Tom Glavine tied it. New York's Roger Clemens 
pitches tomorrow night against Atlanta's John Smoltz.

	Supreme Court To Rule on Electrocutions  
</P>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- For the first time since 1890, the U.S.  
Supreme Court will consider the constitutionality of electrocution. 
The decision halted the use of Florida's electric chair and granted 
an open-ended reprieve to two men scheduled to be executed this 
week. Attorneys for death row inmates have tried unsuccessfully in 
state courts to prove that death in the electric chair violates the 
ban on cruel and unusual punishment. Florida is one of only four 
states in the nation that require execution by electrocution.

	NTSB Investigates Stewart Crash  
</P>
<P>
	MINA, S.D. (AP) -- Investigators began gathering the remains of  
golfer Payne Stewart and five others Tuesday, hoping to determine 
whether a sudden loss in cabin pressure doomed their Learjet, 
killing all on board. The plane had no flight data recorder that 
could yield information on the aircraft and its performance. It had 
a cockpit voice recorder, but it consisted of a 30-minute loop that 
usually records over itself. And Stewart and the others on the 
plane presumably were already unconscious or dead by the last 
half-hour of the flight. The cockpit recorder had not been found as 
of Tuesday night.

	Mumia Abu-Jamal Execution Stayed  
</P>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The Dec. 2 execution of Mumia Abu-Jamal was  
stayed by a federal judge on Tuesday as the former journalist and 
Black Panther began another round of appeals. Abu-Jamal, 45, was 
convicted of murder in the shooting death of Philadelphia police 
Officer Daniel Faulkner in 1981. The appeal argues that prosecutors 
manipulated witnesses to falsely identify Abu-Jamal as the shooter, 
and suppressed and destroyed critical evidence. It also claims the 
judge was biased, blacks were improperly kept off the jury and 
Abu-Jamal's original defense was inadequate.

	Late-Term Abortion Bans Upheld  
</P>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A sharply divided federal appeals court Tuesday  
upheld laws banning certain late-term abortions in Illinois and 
Wisconsin. The 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals split 5-4 over the 
issue. ``We conclude that both laws can be applied in a 
constitutional manner,'' Judge Frank Easterbrook wrote in the 
majority opinion. It reversed a federal judge's ruling that the 
Illinois law was unconstitutional as well as a temporary order from 
an appeals panel that had blocked the Wisconsin law.

	Budget Veto Secured US Vote in UN  
</P>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- U.S. Ambassador Richard Holbrooke said  
today President Clinton was right to veto a budget bill that didn't 
pay U.S. dues to the United Nations, leaving the country without a 
vote in the U.N. General Assembly. He called on Congress to come up 
with the money to pay a substantial chunk of U.S. arrears to the 
world body, saying national security interests were at stake. He 
said the country could lose its forum for debating important global 
issues. 

</P>
<P>
	New Air Bags Reduce Deaths  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Most new vehicles on the road have much less  
powerful air bags than new cars did a few years ago and that is 
resulting in fewer deaths and serious injuries from the devices, 
safety regulators say. Starting with the 1998 model year, many 
automakers said they were installing car air bags with at least 20 
percent less force. The change was in response to a public outcry 
over deaths in low-speed crashes blamed on air bags. Nearly half of 
the newer vehicles have driver air bags that are more recessed into 
the steering wheel so that they inflate farther away from the 
driver.

	TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo stocks fell sharply on Wednesday. The Nikkei

Tuesday, the Dow ended down 47.80 at 10,302.13.

	Gray Apologizes for Rose Interview  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- NBC reporter Jim Gray apologized to baseball  
fans Tuesday night for his contentious interview with Pete Rose 
before Game 2 of the World Series. NBC was deluged by complaints 
from fans Sunday night after Gray's interview with Rose at Turner 
Field in Atlanta. It centered on Rose's lifetime ban from the sport 
for gambling, and came minutes after he returned to a major league 
field for the first time in 10 years as a member of baseball's 
All-Century team.

<HEADLINE> Strange Mission: Win Ryder Cup  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Curtis Strange knows what it's like to catch the blame for being  
on the losing end of the Ryder Cup, and he hasn't even been captain 
yet. 
</P>
<P>
	A member of five teams, the two-time U.S. Open champion knows  
the drill. Players usually get credit for the victories, coaches 
almost always get blamed for the loss. 
</P>
<P>
	Except for Oak Hill.  
</P>
<P>
	The last time Strange was involved in a Ryder Cup, he was Lanny  
Wadkins' captains pick in 1995 and went 0-3, losing the pivotal 
match to Nick Faldo when he missed par putts on the last two holes. 
</P>
<P>
	In 2001 at The Belfry, Strange gets a chance to leave a  
different impression. 
</P>
<P>
	He was officially named captain of the U.S. team that will try  
to retain the Ryder Cup in England in two years under what could be 
a volatile atmosphere, especially considering the hard feelings 
left behind after the Great American Comeback in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Strange said he was up to the task.  
</P>
<P>
	``My mission is to win, simple as that,'' he said from PGA of  
America headquarters in Palm Beach Gardens, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	Strange, 44, succeeds Ben Crenshaw as the 22nd captain for the  
United States. He was considered the leading candidate as soon as 
the United States won 14 1/2-13 1/2, but still was thrilled to finally 
get the call. 
</P>
<P>
	``He possesses a combination of intensity and courage that will  
serve as an example for his team,'' PGA president Will Mann said. 
``His dedication to golf, the impact he has made in the major 
championships, his Ryder Cup experience and his relationship with 
the players make him an ideal individual to captain America's next 
Ryder Cup team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Strange hasn't won since his second U.S. Open title in  
1989, he stays in close contact with the players while playing 
about 15 tournaments a year and working as an analyst for ABC 
Sports. 
</P>
<P>
	Key players already have shown their approval.  
</P>
<P>
	``It will be neat to have him over there in that environment,''  
Tiger Woods said last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Lehman called it a ``great choice, a natural.''  
</P>
<P>
	``He's competitive, he's fiery. He won't be above speaking his  
mind,'' Lehman said. ``And players love it when a captain speaks up 
for them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gentle Ben, he isn't.  
</P>
<P>
	Strange was often regarded as temperamental during his prime, in  
which he was one of the most dominant players of the 1980s. He had 
such singleness of purpose that he often came across as gruff when 
things weren't going his way. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Strange never looked for a fight and won't seek one at  
the Belfry. 
</P>
<P>
	He said one of his first priorities will be to talk with the  
European captain about the intensity that has been building in the 
biennial matches. Sam Torrance is considered the frontrunner to 
succeed Mark James. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're aware of what happened, and we don't expect it to happen  
again,'' Strange said. 
</P>
<P>
	Europeans complained bitterly about insults from the gallery.  
Inside the ropes, they accused U.S. players of inciting the raucous 
fans and crossing the line of sportsmanship by charging across the 
17th green when Justin Leonard holed a 45-foot putt. 
</P>
<P>
	Jose Maria Olazabal still had a 25-foot putt that would have  
kept the match alive and the cup undecided. When the cheering 
subsided, he missed, although the two-time Masters champion later 
said the celebration did not affect the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
	``It might be over the edge and we apologized,'' Strange said.  
``Hopefully, they accept our apology.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strange called the fans at Brookline, Mass., the ``greatest in

	``The Belfry is not going to be as tough as people imagine,'' he  
said. ``They root hard for their own team, which they should. Part

	``Hopefully, the accolades won't go to me if we win because it's

the guts to lose.''

<HEADLINE> For Some, Pizza Is a Way of Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) -- It starts with a meatball.  
</P>
<P>
	Then a cheesesteak. Then some peppercorn pasta primavera with  
parmesan cheese. A Buffalo wing. A slice of pizza. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, you're rolling.  
</P>
<P>
	All your life, you have quested for the perfect slice. You have  
endured soggy crusts, suspect cheeses and drab sauces -- not to 
mention pizza bagels, pizza sticks and other impostors. You have 
encountered some great pies, some lousy pies and many in between. 
</P>
<P>
	Now fate has brought you to the Northeast Pizza Expo at the  
Atlantic City Convention Center. 
</P>
<P>
	On a floor that is nearly the size of two football fields, fate  
has unfolded before you all the stuff of pizza -- the prosaic 
(ovens, signage, paper goods, cash registers, espresso makers) and 
the ambrosial (doughs, sauces, cheeses, toppings, more toppings, 
still more toppings). 
</P>
<P>
	It is time to eat.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Another meatball. Bread, mozzarella and sundried tomato.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``This is too much fun. I'm having the time of my life!'' says  
Frank Rios, who appears to be a slice of mushroom-and-pepperoni 
pizza. 
</P>
<P>
	In real life, Frank is a baseball umpire. A friend of his sells  
mascot costumes and needed someone to model the pizza suit at the 
Expo, so Frank flew in from California (``I figure I might catch a 
couple of shows, have some fun.'') and is now clowning around on 
the convention floor. 
</P>
<P>
	Frank embraces Arturo Tamburelli, a 74-year-old accordionist who  
is singing old Italian tunes on behalf of a cheese company. The 
Pizza Expo is a good gig, Tamburelli says; ``In the old days, there 
used to be a lot of work. Now, it's a day here, a day there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aside from Frank and Arturo, there is little entertainment at  
the Expo. This is, after all, a trade show. And for the 300 
exhibitors and the hundreds of store owners and others who attend, 
pizza is serious business. 
</P>
<P>
	You are reminded, again and again, that pizza is the No. 1 fast  
food in America -- No. 4 in Canada, where hamburgers still dominate, 
according to Joanne Peach of Canadian Pizza Magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	(Yes, our 31 million northern neighbors have their very own  
pizza magazine. In this country, the leading pizza periodicals are 
Pizza Marketing Quarterly and Pizza Today, which offers 
hard-hitting reporting on the popularity of Sicilian pies and the 
multiple uses of mozzarella.) 
</P>
<P>
	Regi Hise, a cheese industry consultant, says Americans eat 125  
acres of pizza a day. He says polls indicate 46 percent prefer 
thick crust, 48 percent prefer thin, and the rest will eat anything 
put in front of them. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	An Original Pizza Log (with pepperoni). Garlic bread. Another  
meatball. Bread with olive oil and herbs. Another slice of pizza. 
Cherry dessert pizza. Four P's Pizza. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	It's a tough business, pizza. The competition is intense, both  
from other small operators and from big boys like Pizza Hut and 
Domino's. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to stress quality, you have to stress freshness, you  
have to stress customer service,'' says Anthony Scalise, who owns 
Prima Pizza of Cornwall, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	But he says you're also looking for an edge -- new products that  
might catch the fancy of fickle consumers. Which brings us to the 
Original Pizza Log, which is basically pizza in an egg-roll 
wrapper. 
</P>
<P>
	At the moment, this is mostly a Western New York delicacy. But  
Russ Klass of Finger Food Products has high hopes for the Original 
Pizza Log, especially for the version that contains roasted 
peppers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I call this one our yuppie Pizza Log,'' he says. ``The young  
women seem to like that. They like the roasted peppers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Scalise, meanwhile, is looking to add the dessert pizza to his  
menu. He tried it six years ago, but it didn't go over. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe it was ahead of its time back then,'' he muses. Now, ``I  
think they're ready. Because they're more open minded.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This anything-goes-on-dough attitude is typified by Goodfella's  
Pizza, a two-store chain in Staten Island and Brooklyn. Goodfella's 
pioneered pizza with vodka cream sauce. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now every store is saying, `We have vodka pie! We have vodka  
pie!''' says E. Jay Myers, co-owner of the restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
	Each year, Pizza Expo sponsors a competition for innovative  
pizzas -- ``Pizza Across America.'' Goodfella's has won two years 
running. Last year's winner was lobster bisque pizza; this year's 
was Four P's, the P's standing for portobellos, porcinis, roasted 
peppers and polenta. 
</P>
<P>
	Four P's is delicious, Myers says, but a fifth P is just as  
important: It is profitable. He charges $14.95 a pie, and materials 
account for 24 percent of that, compared with 28 or 29 percent for 
most other kinds of pizza. 
</P>
<P>
	Hise also notes that the polenta -- basically, mounds of corn  
meal mush -- add a new dimension to the pizza. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything is always horizontal when it comes to a pizza, but  
this gives it a little height,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	New York cheesecake. A Spudster (fried mashed potato nuggets).  
Another slice of pizza. Crazy Berry iced tea. Cheeseburger. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	You can learn many things at the Northeast Pizza Expo.  
</P>
<P>
	--Several booths are devoted to pizza boxes, but not a single box  
displays what is perhaps the most reprinted verse in the English 
language: ``You've tried the rest, now try the best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boxes are more varied these days, says Jeff Tedder, general  
manager of Stronghaven, Inc., a box maker. ``They've gone from 
brown and down to extremely creative.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Pineapple is a hugely popular topping west of the Mississippi,  
but the East Coast is skeptical. So Dole has come up with a 
smaller, 29-ounce can for places that might not have joined the 
pineapple juggernaut. 
</P>
<P>
	--The answer to a pizza lover's prayers is Krisp-It, a mixture of  
flour, yeast, sugar and salt that is sprinkled on the crust and 
keeps it from getting soggy -- at least according to David Pearlman, 
owner of the company and a man who truly believes in his product. 
</P>
<P>
	``The biggest problem in the industry is soggy pizzas!'' he  
says. ``You can make your dough as crispy as cardboard, put 
toppings on it and what'll you have? Soggy cardboard!'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Seafood pizza with champagne-cheese topping. Another slice of  
pizza. Italian-seasoned chicken wing. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Luigi and Michelle Colicci met at a pizzeria, just as Luigi's  
parents did. Their store, Marina's, is 3 years old, like the 
daughter after whom it was named. They work six days a week, 13-14 
hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
	What will they take back to Poughkeepsie from Pizza Expo? Lots  
of ideas from the business seminars. Some new menu items, perhaps. 
</P>
<P>
	They are especially intrigued by the ready-made chicken wings  
sold by La Nova of Buffalo, N.Y. ``Out of this world,'' says 
Michelle, and easy. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coliccis admire La Nova for another reason. The wings  
company is a spin-off from one of the nation's largest independent 
pizza operations, a single-store behemoth that employs 160 people 
and grosses $100,000 a week. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Todaro opened the store in 1957, when pizza was not yet  
ubiquitous. His son, also Joe, and now his grandson, also Joe, have 
carried on. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's in my blood, I'll tell you that,'' says the grandson.  
</P>
<P>
	``Have some wings,'' says his father.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Four teriyaki chicken wings.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Enough.

<HEADLINE> Spurrier Plays Musical Quarterbacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- Leaves change colors. Daylight-saving  
time ends. Steve Spurrier plays musical quarterbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	The quarterback shuffle at No. 5 Florida is an October ritual as  
predictable as any other -- and nothing seems to be changing this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Spurrier said the position isn't necessarily Doug Johnson's to  
keep after a series of games in which he and Johnson have 
communicated poorly and been involved in an occasional argument on 
the sideline. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson still has the starting job heading into Saturday's game  
against No. 10 Georgia, but the coach says he won't hesitate 
bringing Jesse Palmer off the bench if Johnson isn't performing up 
to standards. 
</P>
<P>
	Spurrier reiterated that Tuesday, making it clear that the  
tension between the two is anything but over. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not mad at Doug,'' Spurrier said. ``But certainly, I'm  
frustrated with some of his plays that I've not been able to coach 
him out of. I fully expect Doug to go the distance this week. But 
if it comes to a point that we've got to get somebody else in 
there, then that's what I have to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spurrier has banned both quarterbacks from talking to the media  
this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``They don't have anything to say,'' he said. ``I'll try to talk  
for them a little bit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What he seems to be saying is there's a good chance of Johnson  
getting the hook at some point Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The two have seemingly been at odds since Florida's 31-10  
victory at LSU, in which Spurrier and Johnson had several heated 
discussions on the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
	Spurrier has been most upset with Johnson's decisions to change  
plays at the line of scrimmage. Johnson has admitted his mistakes. 
Teammates are trying to avoid the crossfire. 
</P>
<P>
	``Doug is going to play how he's supposed to play and he's going  
to listen to the coach,'' receiver Darrell Jackson said. ``Even 
with that, we have a backup guy ready to go. So, if Doug and coach 
Spurrier decide to get into another little dispute, we know we've 
got someone we can go with and win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Not everybody's perfect,'' offensive lineman Mike Pearson  
said. ``Players make mistakes. Hopefully, we learn from them and 
don't make them again. Coach is going to put in there who he feels 
can best execute for him. I'm confident with either one in there. I 
don't see it as a distraction at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By this point, it's more the norm than a distraction.  
</P>
<P>
	In 1994, it was Terry Dean being benched in October, when he  
threw four interceptions against Auburn. He was replaced by Danny 
Wuerffel, who went on to become, in Spurrier's view, the best 
quarterback ever to play college football. 
</P>
<P>
	The year before, Wuerffel won the starting job briefly before  
being replaced by Dean in the midst of a three-interception 
performance in a rainstorm against Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson and Palmer are the latest characters in Spurrier's  
shuffle. Last season, they alternated each play for a time, before 
Palmer won the job outright in October. Palmer broke his 
collarbone, however, and Johnson got the job back. It stayed like 
that at the beginning of this season. 
</P>
<P>
	But Spurrier felt increasingly boxed in due to his attempt to  
seek a medical redshirt for Palmer for this season. The coach has 
realized the redshirt idea was a bad one and has given up on it. 
</P>
<P>
	That means Palmer is the legitimate No. 2. He's getting more  
work in practice this week and will have to stay warm come 
gametime. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's a mistake to go in thinking you've just got one  
experienced quarterback,'' Spurrier said. ``I think we're better 
off bringing in two or three -- two at least. That's all we're 
trying to do.''

<HEADLINE> Congress, U.S. in Budget Battle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congress and the White House are once again  
locked in a budget battle rooted in both a political debacle -- the 
1995 government shutdown -- and a rare moment of agreement -- the 
1997 balanced budget accord. 
</P>
<P>
	Weeks into the new fiscal year that began Oct. 1, President  
Clinton and congressional Republicans are still at odds over five 
of the 13 spending bills needed to run the federal government. Only 
by passing stopgap spending bills have they managed to avoid a 
repeat of the winter of 1995-96, when the government was paralyzed 
first for five, and then 21 days. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton in 1995 needed to show he could stand up to the new  
GOP-controlled Congress. Then-House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., 
was contending with conservative freshmen demanding a timetable for 
balancing the budget and was angry over a perceived presidential 
snub aboard Air Force One. 
</P>
<P>
	The result, the longest government shutdown in U.S. history, was  
a political disaster for the Republicans, who took much of the 
blame. Civil servants went back to work in January but it was 
months later, with the fiscal year more than half over and some 11 
temporary spending bills behind them, that the two sides reached a 
level of agreement on the budget. 
</P>
<P>
	As bad as it was, the impasse was hardly new. The  
Democratic-controlled Congress in 1974 agreed to move the start of 
the fiscal year from July 1 to Oct. 1 because of the difficulty in 
completing the budget on time. Still, Congress has approved all 13 
spending bills on time only three times in the past 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	There also were four shutdowns before 1995, three during the  
Reagan administration, but none resulted in more than a day's work 
lost. 
</P>
<P>
	Rudolph Penner, an economist who headed the Congressional Budget  
Office from 1983-87, recalled ``the same kind of pseudo-crises 
related to shutting down the government.'' But now, he said, ``It 
is worse, worse in the number of budget gimmicks being used, worse 
in the level of discussion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Budget negotiators were right back at it in the fall of 1996  
when Republicans and the White House could agree on little beyond 
that there must not be another shutdown. The solution was a giant, 
last-minute package that encompassed six of the 13 spending bills 
with some $389 billion in funding. 
</P>
<P>
	The president signed the 3,000-page document two hours before  
the new fiscal year was to begin. Again, as with the shutdown, many 
Republicans felt they had been snookered, rushed into accepting new 
spending that the White House wanted and they strongly opposed. 
</P>
<P>
	Things went much better in 1997, when Clinton and the  
Republicans, after protracted negotiations, agreed on a package to 
balance the budget by 2002 and carry out tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	But the euphoria was short-lived. In 1998, differences over  
priorities again stalled passage of spending bills and resulted in 
an even bigger omnibus bill thrashed out in eight days of 
closed-door talks. It covered nine spending bills worth $520 
billion. The consensus again was that Clinton had come out a 
winner, getting a lot more than he gave. 
</P>
<P>
	There was bipartisan agreement that this was not the way to run  
a government. ``A humungous monstrosity'' was what Sen. John 
Ashcroft, R-Mo., said of the process. ``Utterly abominable,'' said 
Sen. Tim Johnson, D-S.D. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP leaders this year were adamant that there would be neither a  
shutdown nor an omnibus bill in which they do horse-trading with 
Clinton. But they share a common dilemma -- how to fund favored 
programs while living up to mutual promises to put the Social 
Security surplus off-limits. 
</P>
<P>
	The two sides also have agreed to ignore spending limits set in  
the 1997 deal. Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., the ranking Democrat on the 
House Appropriations Committee, called the 1997 agreement a 
``public lie'' because it required spending limits Congress could 
never live up to. 
</P>
<P>
	Spending levels set for 1999 and 2000 were unrealistic, agreed  
James Horney, senior fellow at the private Center on Budget and 
Policy Priorities. 
</P>
<P>
	``People just shrug their shoulders'' when asked how this year's  
confrontation will end, he said. Lawmakers, he said, ``are 
constantly painting themselves into corners and (if) you add to it 
the mutual distrust, it's hard to see how in the end they come 
together.''

<HEADLINE> Group Studies Who'll Take Bribes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERLIN (AP) -- Scandinavians are the least likely to give or  
demand bribes in business deals, according to surveys released 
today that seek to focus attention not only on corrupt governments 
that take the money, but those offering it as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Transparency International, a private group that compiles an  
annual Corruption Perceptions Index as part of its global campaign 
for clean government, this year also commissioned a Bribe Payers 
Index to show what chairman Peter Eigen called ``the other side of 
the coin.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The Corruption Perceptions Index always shows the Third World  
in a negative light, but it's a one-sided picture,'' Eigen told 
reporters in Berlin, where Transparency International is based. 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast, the new Bribe Payers Index covers ``the hand that  
pays the bribe,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost 800 senior business executives in 14 emerging market  
countries were asked whose companies among the world's 19 leading 
exporting nations were the most likely to offer bribes. 
</P>
<P>
	Sweden -- the only Scandinavian country among the 19 leading  
exporters -- got the best score, 8.3 out of a possible 10, meaning 
there was very little perceived corruption. Australia and Canada 
tied for second, while South Korea and China, including Hong Kong, 
brought up the rear. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the world's three biggest export economies, the United States  
and Germany tied at No. 9 and Japan trailed at No. 14. 
</P>
<P>
	Specific businesses were not named, although Transparency  
International said it was in the process of breaking its data down 
by industry branch and would release more information in December. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey by Gallup International had a standard error of 0.2  
points or less. 
</P>
<P>
	The different perceptions of corruption highlighted by the Bribe  
Payers Index ``challenges the private assertions by many 
businessmen that they need to pay bribes because their competitors 
do,'' Eigen said. 
</P>
<P>
	He also expressed optimism that the tide against corruption was  
slowly turning, pointing to successes like the signing of a new 
anti-bribery treaty by 33 nations on Feb. 15. 
</P>
<P>
	The treaty has prompted signatories like Germany and Switzerland  
to abolish tax deductions for bribes paid abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past three years, organizations like the World Bank,  
where Eigen was director of East African programs until 1991, have 
gone from ignoring corruption in countries where they lend to 
actively fighting it, Eigen said. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't say we've reduced corruption 10 percent or something  
like that,'' he said. ``But we feel we're in a positive trend.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 1999 Corruption Perceptions Index, a compilation of polls  
covering the degree of government corruption perceived within a 
country, was topped again by Denmark with a perfect, 
corruption-free 10. 
</P>
<P>
	It was followed by Finland, New Zealand, Sweden, Canada and  
Iceland -- also the same as last year. 
</P>
<P>
	At the bottom of the 99-nation list were Azerbaijan, Indonesia,  
Nigeria and Cameroon.

<HEADLINE> Minnesota Bans Team From Postseason </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- The University of Minnesota decided today to  
hold its basketball team -- a Final Four participant in 1997 -- out 
of postseason play for one year because of alleged academic 
cheating in the program. 
</P>
<P>
	School president Mark Yudof believes the NCAA will impose more  
sanctions after it receives the university's final report on the 
investigation of the basketball program. 
</P>
<P>
	An investigation into the program began in March after former  
tutor Jan Gangelhoff claimed she did more than 400 pieces of course 
work for at least 20 basketball players from 1993 to 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation has since widened to include accusations of  
improper payments and travel irregularities, and alleged sexual and 
other misconduct in the men's athletics department. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must demonstrate good faith and take meaningful action to  
repair the damage that has been done by others,'' Yudof said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said it was a judgment call to impose sanctions that might be  
harsher than the NCAA's. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we do need to impose sanctions,'' he said. ``I don't  
hate to do it. It's the right thing to do. The NCAA has to worry 
about deterrents. I have to worry about deterrents in the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NCAA spokeswoman Jane Jankowski said the organization would not  
comment specifically on whatever sanctions Yudof announces. But she 
said it is appropriate and common for embattled schools to come up 
with their own sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Universities do frequently hand down their own penalties, and  
our (investigating) committee considers that and can adopt those 
sanctions, as well as add other penalties,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Clem Haskins resigned under pressure in June and accepted  
a $1.5 million buyout of his contract. He has said he had no 
knowledge of any academic cheating in the basketball program.

<HEADLINE> Nuke Plants Said To Need Y2K Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congresssional auditors say the government  
should take additional steps to ensure that the year 2000 computer 
bug will not cause dangerous malfunctions at any of the nation's 
nuclear plants. 
</P>
<P>
	``To further reduce risks, NRC and the nuclear power industry  
can still take specific action to ensure Y2K-related plant 
safety,'' the General Accounting Office said in testimony prepared 
for a hearing Tuesday before the House Science technology 
subcommittee . 
</P>
<P>
	GAO officials said the Nuclear Regulatory Commission should:  
</P>
<P>
	--Require independent verification of plants' claims of Y2K  
readiness. 
</P>
<P>
	--Determine whether plants' most recent emergency exercises have  
included Y2K-specific scenarios in addition to general disaster 
preparedness. 
</P>
<P>
	--Ensure each plant has a checklist of things that must be done  
before and after New Year's Eve midnight. 
</P>
<P>
	GAO officials also said the NRC should follow up to ensure that  
other types of nuclear facilities have made good on Y2K readiness 
promises. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission's deputy director for reactor programs, Frank  
Miraglia, sought to reassure lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will closely monitor the progress of plants that still have  
some systems left to remediate, but we fully expect that all 
commercial nuclear power plants will operate safely, as planned and 
without interruption, through the Y2K transition,'' Miraglia said. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States has in operation 103 nuclear power plants at  
66 sites, mostly in the East. Another 19 plants are no longer 
working, but 14 still have stored highly radioactive spent nuclear 
fuel. Ten more U.S. plants produce nuclear fuel. 
</P>
<P>
	The NRC has reported that all the operating power plants are Y2K  
ready except Philadelphia Electric Co.'s Peach Bottom 3 in 
Pennsylvania and Southern Nuclear Operating Co.'s Farley 2 in 
Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
	The two remaining plants have completed work on their safety  
systems but must finish repairing operating equipment, the NRC 
says. The Pennsylvania plant is to be ready by the end of October. 
Work at the Alabama plant is to be finished by mid-December. 
</P>
<P>
	The NRC also has reported that all decommissioned plants and  
fuel-making facilities were on track to be Y2K ready, although the 
agency's latest information does not confirm that readiness has 
been achieved at all sites.

<HEADLINE> Consumer Confidence Drops Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Consumers aren't as bullish about the stock  
market and the long-running economic expansion these days, with a 
new survey showing confidence dropping sharply in October to extend 
its decline from a 30-year high to four straight months. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Conference Board survey released Tuesday also says most  
Americans don't seem ready to scale back their spending yet. That 
bodes well for retailers who are gearing up for the imminent start 
of the holiday shopping season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Shoppers might not splurge as much as they've done in the past  
... consumer enthusiasm is waning a bit,'' said Gary Thayer, chief 
economist at A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc. in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	``But that doesn't mean that they aren't spending at all. They  
still feel good about things and it will likely be a happy 
holiday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Conference Board's index of consumer confidence, which is a  
measure of consumers' willingness to spend, fell to 130.1 in 
October from a revised 134.2 in September. The drop in confidence 
was greater than analysts had expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the index is nearly nine points below its peak of 139 in  
June, which was the highest reading in more than 30 years. 
October's reading, however, is still well ahead of the 119.8 
registered a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer sentiment is an important economic indicator, since  
consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of the nation's overall 
economic activity. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts attribute the decline in confidence to rising interest  
rates and a volatile stock market. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Reserve has twice this year boosted interest rates  
to try to keep the economy from overheating as it attempts to head 
off a resurgence of inflation. Many economists say another rate 
hike is possible if there aren't signs of a slowdown. 
</P>
<P>
	But the figures Tuesday suggest the Fed's interest rate  
increases already are having an impact. 
</P>
<P>
	Alfred Broaddus, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of  
Richmond, Va., said at a North Carolina appearance Tuesday that he 
does not expect the U.S. economy to continue growing at 4 percent, 
as it has over the past three years. 
</P>
<P>
	The economy's expansion, which began in March 1991, already is  
the longest peacetime growth in U.S. history and will become the 
longest expansion ever if it continues through February. 
</P>
<P>
	Worries about rising interest rates have shaken Wall Street,  
sending stocks on a wild ride over the last few months. The Dow 
Jones industrial average reached a record of 11,326.04 in Aug. 25, 
but fell as low as 10,019.71 on Oct. 15. 
</P>
<P>
	The blue-chip index fell 47.80 Tuesday to close at 10,302.,13.  
</P>
<P>
	``The levels of confidence are still high, but we've backed off  
a little,'' said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at Wells Fargo in 
Minneapolis. ``It all depends what happens from here. If the stock 
market declines further and we get another rate hike, then 
consumers may really start worrying.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But for now, panic hasn't set in and consumers remain relatively  
confident about what's ahead. Helping lift sentiment is the 
extremely strong labor market, with unemployment levels at a 
29-year low. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the Conference Board survey, more Americans say  
current business conditions are good and jobs are plentiful. In 
addition, more plan to buy a car, a major appliance for their home 
or go on a vacation in the next six months. 
</P>
<P>
	With Christmas around the bend, retailers are expecting healthy  
sales gains during the holiday season. Most analysts estimate sales 
to rise about 5 percent to 6 percent from a year ago at traditional 
stores. 
</P>
<P>
	While that trails the pace seen during the first nine months of  
the year, a 5 percent gain is still considered fairly strong and it 
follows a very strong selling season a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Even bigger gains are expected in shopping on the Internet, with  
sales expected to more than double from 1998 as many new merchants 
enter the Web marketplace, expanding the goods available online. 
</P>
<P>
	``People have jobs, they earn money and they feel free to spend  
it,'' said Kurt Barnard, a retail consultant and president of 
Barnard's Retail Trend Report in Upper Montclair, N.J. ``When it 
comes to the holidays, they aren't going to hold back. Of course, 
they are going to buy gifts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There is, however, some concern that spending will moderate in  
the new year because the Fed's rate hikes may cause the housing 
market to cool further from this year's record-setting pace and 
also could hurt sales of big-ticket items that many people buy on 
credit. At the same time, many Americans already are borrowed up to 
the hilt. 
</P>
<P>
	The consumer confidence survey is based on a poll of 5,000  
households conducted by NFO Research Inc. of Greenwich, Conn. The 
index has a base of 100, set in 1985.

<HEADLINE> British Back U.S. Drug Proposal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Britain will back the U.S. proposal for a drug  
agency that is not controlled by the International Olympic 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Barry McCaffrey, head of the White House drug policy office, is  
touring Europe to build support for an independent international 
agency to lead the fight against performance-enhancing drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	McCaffrey opposes the IOC's plans for such an agency, contending  
it would lack independence and accountability. But the IOC said 
Tuesday it plans to set up its agency next month and have it 
operating by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	In a joint statement after a two-day meeting in London with  
British anti-drugs coordinator Keith Hellawell, Britain endorsed 
McCaffrey's five principles: 
</P>
<P>
	--an independent and accountable anti-drug agency.  
</P>
<P>
	--testing on a year-round, no-notice basis.  
</P>
<P>
	--no statute of limitations for drug offenses.  
</P>
<P>
	--preservation of samples so they can be tested years later when  
new detection techniques are developed. 
</P>
<P>
	--advanced research.  
</P>
<P>
	McCaffrey will present his plan in Belgium on Wednesday to the  
European Commission. On Thursday, he will meet in Portugal with 
drug policy officials of the 15 European Union countries. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview, McCaffrey said he hopes to enlist European  
opposition to the IOC plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we don't act, we're going to have a Swiss corporation, the  
International Olympic Committee, assert that they can unilaterally 
decide on a drug-testing agency that won't in fact be independent 
and probably won't achieve the results and won't have credibility 
with the world's athletes,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	McCaffrey said the agency will only be independent if it has  
``the ability to act without being a wholly owned subsidiary to the 
IOC.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he expects support from Britain, France, Germany, Canada  
and Australia at a 26-nation drug summit in Australia next month 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not looking for a fight,'' he said, ``but clearly we  
have a heavy responsibility. ... I can't imagine we're going to 
continue to ignore a situation that we think is untenable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCaffrey said he would be happy to meet with IOC president Juan  
Antonio Samaranch. And despite the standoff, he said he expects the 
sides can work together and reach some sort of consensus. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the end of the day, I have a feeling that rational thought  
will win out,'' McCaffrey said. ``I can't imagine there isn't going 
to be a sensible outcome.'' 
</P>
<P>
	IOC spokesman Franklin Servan-Schreiber said Tuesday the IOC was  
going forward with its agency with or without McCaffrey's approval. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the agency, set up as a Swiss foundation, will start  
Nov. 10 with the appointment of a board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
	Servan-Schreiber said European sports ministers had responded  
favorably to the IOC project, and the EU's new sports commissioner, 
Viviane Reding, will meet with Samaranch in Lausanne, Switzerland, 
on Nov. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	The spokesman said the IOC could not control the agency because  
the 24-member board would include only three representatives from 
the IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	``There has never been any question of the IOC controlling the  
agency,'' Servan-Schreiber said. ``And the claim that the IOC 
should not be involved at all seems to us a little unfair 
considering we were the ones who stepped up to the plate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The agency will initially be located in Lausanne. Other cities  
expressing interest in serving as headquarters include Athens, 
Greece; Lille, France; Lisbon, Portugal; Luxembourg; Madrid, Spain; 
and Vienna, Austria.

<HEADLINE> Starr, Justice Dept. Met in Secret </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a secret confrontation the Sunday before  
Kenneth Starr testified at President Clinton's impeachment hearing, 
Attorney General Janet Reno stunned the prosecutor with news that 
her Justice Department would review allegations of misconduct 
against his office. 
</P>
<P>
	The allegations, which included the treatment of Monica  
Lewinsky, had been around for months, and the two sides even had 
discussed them before. But no action had been taken. Now four days 
before Starr's pivotal testimony, Reno had opted to review the 
allegations, but withhold a full-scale investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Sitting in Reno's fifth-floor conference room, Starr folded his  
arms and glared at the attorney general. ``I will take steps in 
every way I can to protect the integrity and independence of the 
investigation,'' he said sternly. 
</P>
<P>
	He told Reno he had ``profound concern'' that if news about the  
review reached the public, it could be used as a political weapon 
to discredit his investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``If this leaks, I'll be the second-maddest person in  
Washington, D.C.,'' Reno replied, seeking to assure the prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
	Unknown to Starr, Reno's plans already had leaked. While the  
independent counsel sat with Reno on Nov. 15, 1998, his office was 
frantically paging him, attempting to alert him to phone calls 
coming from reporters already inquiring about the Justice review. 
</P>
<P>
	The meeting, described to The Associated Press by lawyers  
familiar with it, is cited by all those involved as a turning point 
in the relationship between Starr's office and Reno's department. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Starr stepped down this month after five stormy years of  
investigating President Clinton and his wife, Hillary, the results 
of Justice's internal review remain secret. Any findings still 
could affect how the public ultimately views Starr's work, which 
will be summarized in a final report to be written by his 
successor, Robert Ray. 
</P>
<P>
	A senior Justice official said the department took two steps in  
deference to Starr's probe. 
</P>
<P>
	``First, while we first raised this issue with him in July 1998,  
we waited until Starr completed the Lewinsky grand jury 
investigation and sent his report to the House to discuss the issue 
with him again,'' the official said, speaking only on condition of 
anonymity. ``Second, we told Starr we were prepared to work with 
his office to find a way to conduct a review in the least intrusive 
way possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Former Iran-Contra prosecutor Lawrence Walsh, a critic of the  
Lewinsky sex-and-cover-up investigation, said he sympathized with 
Starr and ``would hate to have the Justice Department doing that to 
me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he added, ``as long as the attorney general has the power to  
remove an independent counsel, she has the power to investigate his 
questionable activities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walsh said friction between an independent counsel and the  
department is inevitable because the department ``feels a duty to 
assist bona fide prosecutions, but at the same time it's counsel 
for the government.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Excerpts from letters provided to AP show the relationship  
between Justice and Starr only grew worse behind closed doors as 
the impeachment drama played out in public last winter. 
</P>
<P>
	Within weeks of the meeting, Starr's office became convinced  
Justice had made its move in order to give Democrats fresh fodder 
to attack Starr as the House drew closer to the impeachment vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``The timing'' of the review ``raises more starkly than anything  
in our relationship to date -- the specter of politically motivated 
interference,'' Starr deputy Robert Bittman wrote the office of 
Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder on Dec. 2, 1998. ``You decline 
to apprise us of even the nature of the allegations against us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The Justice Department -- which could not investigate the  
president owing to the obvious conflict of interest -- proposes at 
this most delicate juncture to investigate the investigator,'' 
Bittman wrote, adding a complaint about the leak. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's prosecutors, at Reno's suggestion, had met with Justice  
officials on Nov. 23 and Dec. 1 to explore ways of working together 
to review the allegations, which had been flooding into the 
department from Clinton supporters on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	Among them:  
</P>
<P>
	--Starr should have told the Justice Department of his 1994  
contacts with Paula Jones's lawyers in her sexual harassment 
lawsuit against Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	--Starr's prosecutors should not have discussed an immunity deal  
with Ms. Lewinsky without her lawyer present. 
</P>
<P>
	--Starr's office wired up Linda Tripp to record a conversation  
with Ms. Lewinsky before Starr even had jurisdiction from Reno to 
proceed with the Lewinsky probe. 
</P>
<P>
	For six weeks after the Dec. 1 meeting, there was no contact.  
Then came a reply Jan. 14. 
</P>
<P>
	``I reject in the strongest terms'' the ``charge that the  
department has engaged in 'politically motivated interference,''' 
Holder's office wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Holder's office said the letter from Starr's office was ``wholly  
unjustified,'' that it was ``very disappointed'' by the letter's 
tone and that the department would list the allegations it intended 
to review. 
</P>
<P>
	The friction with Justice weighed heavily on Starr, who has  
flashed his bitterness at Reno in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our relations soured over the last 18 months,'' Starr wrote in  
The Wall Street Journal last week. ``At times, political appointees 
in the department actively interfered with our investigation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eventually, discussions resumed between Justice and Starr. On  
May 28, Starr supplied the department's Office of Professional 
Responsibility a point-by-point rebuttal totaling several hundred 
pages to the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's office never heard back.

<HEADLINE> India, Pakistan Clash at Border </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SRINAGAR, India (AP) -- Indian troops used artillery and small  
arms to fend off the most serious border incursion by Pakistani 
troops since a military coup in Pakistan two weeks ago, the army 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Four Pakistani soldiers and an Indian civilian were killed and  
three other Indian civilians injured during Monday's battle in the 
mountainous Uri sector of Kashmir. Houses in several villages also 
were damaged in the daylong artillery duel. 
</P>
<P>
	Indian soldiers prevented a squad of Pakistani soldiers from  
seizing two fortified positions inside India, said a statement 
issued in Srinagar, the summer capital of the Himalayan territory. 
It did not mention Indian casualties. 
</P>
<P>
	In Pakistan, army spokesman Col. Salaut Raza had no comment on  
the report. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, Indian military officials said three people were  
wounded by Pakistani artillery fire in the same sector, 15 miles 
west of Srinagar. 
</P>
<P>
	In May, Indian soldiers launched a major campaign to oust  
Pakistan-backed fighters who had sneaked across the cease-fire line 
and seized mountain tops in Kashmir. The 11-week battle left 
hundreds of fighters from both nations dead or wounded. 
</P>
<P>
	India and Pakistan have fought two wars over Kashmir, which is  
split between them. Both claim it in its entirety. India says 
Pakistan is fueling a 10-year Islamic insurrection with arms and 
training, which Pakistan denies. 
</P>
<P>
	Border clashes have become routine over the volatile cease-fire  
line in Kashmir, but there had been a slackening after Pakistani 
army chief Gen. Pervaiz Musharraf ousted the elected government of 
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in a bloodless coup Oct. 12. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Musharraf withdrew reinforcements moved to the  
international border during the summer fighting. But the pullback 
did not include the cease-fire line that divides Kashmir. 
</P>
<P>
	India reacted coolly to the gesture, saying there was not as  
much tension along the border as on the cease-fire line. 
</P>
<P>
	Musharraf also said Pakistan would continue its diplomatic and  
moral support for Kashmiri militant groups fighting Indian 
authorities. The decade-long insurrection has left 25,000 soldiers, 
guerrillas and civilians dead. 
</P>
<P>
	India has voiced ``grave concern'' over the coup in Pakistan. In
