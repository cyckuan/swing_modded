<HEADLINE> Dole: Hollywood Should Help Veterans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Former presidential candidate Bob Dole  
suggested Friday that the nation's film industry could do more to 
help veterans. ``They've made a lot of money making World War II 
movies,'' he told a Senate hearing. ``So far, they've kept it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dole softened his testimony to the Senate Veterans Affairs  
Committee to single out actor Tom Hanks for praise. Hanks, who 
played a starring role in the 1998 hit movie ``Saving Private 
Ryan,'' has been helpful in raising funds for a $100 million World 
War II memorial to be built in the nation's capital, Dole said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kansas Republican, who was wounded badly in World War II,  
testified on behalf of a bipartisan commission's recommendations 
for a package of increases in military and veterans benefits. Dole 
sponsored the legislation that set up the commission in 1996, 
before he resigned from the Senate to pursue a losing presidential 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Dole said he's been spending some of his time trying to raise  
funds for the World War II memorial, which is to be built on the 
Mall in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton dedicated the 7.4 acre site in 1995. But Dole  
told the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, ``It's very hard to 
raise $100 million. We don't want the government to raise the 
money, we want to raise it ourselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said about $40 million has been collected so far.  
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't had much success tapping the movie industry. So if  
you have any friends there, we'd appreciate it,'' Dole told his 
former colleagues. ``We haven't given up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Actor Hanks helped raise about $75,000 for the memorial by  
mentioning the 800 number in a television appearance and planned to 
do public service announcements, Dole said. ``So we've had some 
cooperation from some of the people out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dole, 75, whose right arm was permanently disabled by wounds  
suffered fighting in Italy in 1945, said it was important for the 
nation not to forget its World War II veterans. ``And one way to 
remember this generation is to have some fitting memorial in 
Washington, D.C.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dole's jab at the entertainment industry isn't new. During the  
1996 campaign, he frequently criticized Hollywood for the content 
of its movies. 
</P>
<P>
	His wife, Elizabeth, recently resigned as president of the  
American Red Cross to test the waters for her own possible GOP 
presidential bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Dole told the panel that it was long past time to boost benefits  
for the nation's 26 million veterans, of which 6.5 million are 
World War II veterans. 
</P>
<P>
	The bipartisan panel has recommended the most sweeping changes  
in benefit programs since the 1950s, including a merging of VA and 
military hospital services, easier terms for veterans buying their 
first homes, investment plans for enlistees like 401(k) plans in 
the private sector, and expanded educational benefits under the GI 
bill. 
</P>
<P>
	The most controversial part of the package is a recommendation  
that the government pick up the entire cost of a college education 
-- at any college, regardless of cost -- for anyone who has served 
four years in active military duty. 
</P>
<P>
	Dole said the phone number for contributions was 1-800-639-4992.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Phone Action Hits Block </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Relatives of the Cuban-Americans who were killed  
when Cuba shot down their private planes are attempting to seize 
millions of dollars paid by U.S. phone companies to their Cuban 
counterpart. The U.S. government is fighting their effort. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department on Thursday urged a Miami judge to block  
the attempt, saying it is illegal and could result in the severing 
of phone links between the United States and Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	Four members of the Miami-based group Brothers to the Rescue who  
were searching for refugees on rafts were killed when Cuban MiGs 
shot down two private planes in the Florida Straits on Feb. 24, 
1996. Three of them were U.S. citizens, making their families 
eligible to sue under U.S. law. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, U.S. District Judge James Lawrence King awarded a $187  
million judgment to the relatives, and they have tried to collect 
the money from Cuba's communist government ever since. 
</P>
<P>
	The relatives first went after tens of millions of dollars in  
Cuban assets in the United States frozen by the State Department 
since the 1960s, but ran into opposition from the State and 
Treasury departments. 
</P>
<P>
	They then turned to the money being paid to Cuba's ETECSA phone  
company by U.S. telephone companies as Havana's share of the 
payments for long-distance calls from the United States to Cuba. 
That amounted to an estimated $60 million to $70 million in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 17-page statement, Justice Department lawyers said that the  
U.S. trade embargo bans any financial dealings with Cuba, including 
garnishments, unless specifically licensed by Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	They also argued that ETECSA, a joint venture between the  
government and an Italian company, is an independent company and 
therefore cannot be affected by the relatives' suit against the 
Cuban government. 
</P>
<P>
	``The United States condemns the unlawful acts committed by Cuba  
and sympathizes with the devastating losses experienced by the 
plaintiffs,'' it said. ``Nevertheless, plaintiffs' interests must 
defer to ... law.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The statement also noted that Havana had vowed that it would cut  
U.S.-Cuba telephone links if its share of the income is garnisheed. 
</P>
<P>
	However, lawyers for the family said that the Justice Department  
is wrong to interfere. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our government is once again stepping in on the side of  
terrorists,'' said Frank Angones, one of the relatives' lawyers. 
``We must force Cuba to accept its guilt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even before the judge awarded the multimillion-dollar judgment,  
the families received $300,000 each in November 1996 that the U.S. 
government plucked from frozen Cuban accounts. The government 
called it a humanitarian gesture.

<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski was recovering Friday  
from gall bladder surgery and hoped to be back in Washington at the 
impeachment trial next week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Maryland Democrat was resting at Mercy Medical Center after  
a successful operation that took 1 1/2 hours, her spokeswoman Mona 
Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mikulski, 62, went to Mercy's emergency room on Tuesday with  
complaints of severe, lingering flu-like symptoms. Doctors 
discovered that they were caused by an inflamed gall bladder. 
</P>
<P>
	She returned to Washington for Wednesday's votes on an  
unsuccessful Democratic measure to end President Clinton's 
impeachment trial and a Republican measure to allow depositions of 
three witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	She surprised colleagues by initially voting against the motion  
to end the trial, but quickly corrected her mistake. 
</P>
<P>
	She missed three votes on Thursday, opting to rest before her  
surgery.

	SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO, Calif. (AP) -- Larry Fortensky, an  
ex-husband of Elizabeth Taylor, was critically injured after 
falling down a flight of stairs at his home. 
</P>
<P>
	Paramedics were called at about 3 a.m. Thursday, said Capt.  
Scott Brown of the Orange County Fire Authority. Details about the

<HEADLINE> Steel Execs Wary Over Import Drop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Steel industry leaders and supporters  
concerned with last year's surge in cheap imports are vowing to 
remain vigilant despite a one-month drop in shipments. 
</P>
<P>
	As the Commerce Department hinted at a reversal in import  
trends, steel executives and lawmakers from steel-producing states 
complained that monthly imports were still too high. 
</P>
<P>
	``These moderate reductions must not be allowed to serve as the  
administration's latest excuse for failing to enforce our trade 
laws and protect American steelworkers,'' said Sen. Jay Rockefeller 
of West Virginia, the Democratic chairman of the Senate Steel 
Caucus. 
</P>
<P>
	The department said Thursday that imports dropped 31 percent in  
December. More dramatic reductions were recorded for imports from 
Japan and Russia, two of the countries blamed for a recent import 
surge that contributed to more than 10,000 U.S. layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Commerce Secretary William Daley acknowledged that no pattern  
can be drawn from only one month's worth of figures. He promised to 
continue monitoring the data to determine whether to seek trade 
sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the one-month drop, import levels were still higher than  
those of 1997, before the Asian economic crisis lowered demand for 
steel abroad and forced foreign producers to seek U.S. outlets. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. steel producers contend that much of the product is being  
illegally dumped in the United States at prices dramatically below 
production costs. Formal complaints are pending against Japan, 
Russia and Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's sort of like, OK, I've been doing something illegal to  
you for months but I'm stopping a little bit now,'' said Rep. Bob 
Ney, R-Ohio. ``These numbers are nothing to us. They're still 
higher than before and we're not going to stop until justice is 
done for those steel workers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Wilhelm, president of U.S. Steel Group, said the industry  
will file additional trade complaints as early as next month, 
dealing with different steel products and different originating 
countries from the cases filed in September. 
</P>
<P>
	Daley, speaking with reporters by telephone from the annual  
World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, attributed the 
reductions in December to actions taken by the Clinton 
administration, notwithstanding criticisms from the industry that 
President Clinton has done too little. 
</P>
<P>
	In November, the Commerce Department threatened that any duties  
applied against Japan and Russia might be retroactive to 
mid-November. Faced with the prospect of additional duties, 
exporters began to cut back their shipments. 
</P>
<P>
	Daley said the administration will continue talks to persuade  
Russia to lower shipments to the United States even more and the 
European Union to take a greater share of the foreign steel now 
being sent to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department, releasing preliminary trade figures for  
steel for the first time, said Japanese producers shipped 47 
percent less steel in December, compared with the previous month. 
Steel imports from Russia dropped 79 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the drop in December was in hot-rolled steel, the target  
of industry's dumping complaints. 
</P>
<P>
	Final figures are due in about three weeks. The administration  
decided to release preliminary data to give the domestic industry 
an earlier warning of import trends. Officials expect the 
preliminary figures to equal about 96 percent of the final numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	In adjusted figures for 1998 through November, imports from  
Japan increased nearly threefold from a year earlier and imports 
from Russia jumped about 60 percent. Overall, imports to the United 
States went up 33 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Dan Griswold, a trade analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute,  
said he expected the figures to ``give the administration more 
reason to resist the more extreme calls for protection.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Threatens Force in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton declared today that the  
United States and its allies are united behind an international 
military and political strategy pressuring Serbs to end their 
assault in Kosovo. ``We stand ready to back that strategy with the 
threat of force.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton spoke the morning after Secretary of State Madeleine  
Albright and representatives from Britain, France, Germany, Russia 
and Italy negotiated a two-step plan for settling the Kosovo 
problem by mid-February. 
</P>
<P>
	``The international community has sent a clear message to the  
authorities in Belgrade: The time for denial and delay is past. 
NATO is united and ready to act if you don't,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	This afternoon, the president's top national security advisers  
were meeting at the White House to discuss the situation in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	With speculation already turning to next steps and the possible  
deployment of U.S. troops in any international monitoring force, 
White House spokesman David Leavy said such a discussion was 
premature until ``there is a political settlement and (Yugoslav 
President Slobodan) Milosevic complies with its political 
obligations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Today's meeting ``is not a decision meeting,'' Leavy added.  
</P>
<P>
	The president said he was particularly outraged by the  
execution-style massacre two weeks ago of dozens of people in Racak 
village in southern Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our goal is not merely to respond to the recent atrocities in  
Kosovo, but to help resolve the conflict so that the violence can 
end for good,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also today, a group of influential Washington voices on foreign  
policy published an open letter to Clinton asserting, ``All eyes 
are turned to Washington. Only forceful U.S. leadership can stop 
Milosevic from continuing this new round of ethnic cleansing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The letter in The New York Times was signed by 21 people,  
including former Sen. Bob Dole; Zbigniew Brzezinski, President 
Carter's national security adviser; former U.N. Ambassador Jeane 
Kirkpatrick; Caspar Weinberger, President Reagan's defense 
secretary; and former CIA Director R. James Woolsey. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the NATO plan, Yugoslavia would grant ``substantial  
autonomy'' to the ethnic Albanians who make up about 90 percent of 
Kosovo's population and reduce levels of troops and special police 
units in the war-torn province. 
</P>
<P>
	The British foreign secretary and French foreign minister would  
chair negotiations, beginning Feb. 6, between Milosevic's Yugoslav 
government and representatives of the ethnic Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said today that the strategy would give the people of  
Kosovo ``the self-government they deserve.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Both sides now have an opportunity to stop a war that neither  
side can win and to start building a better future for all the 
people by peaceful means.''

<HEADLINE> WTO: U.S. Can Sanction EU Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- The World Trade Organization agreed in principle  
Friday that the United States can impose sanctions on products from 
the European Union in their long-running trade row over banana 
imports. 
</P>
<P>
	But the EU ensured that sanctions won't take effect immediately  
by calling for arbitration to determine the level of sanctions. The 
United States has threatened to apply $520 million worth of 
tariffs; the EU says sanctions should not be applied at all. 
</P>
<P>
	After a week of bitter procedural wrangling, Friday's agreement  
was hailed as a compromise. The battle has paralyzed the trade body 
and raised fears about its ability to work in the future. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington has been pressing for the WTO to allow sanctions  
against European products to come into force by March 3 at the 
latest. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States says the EU's banana import laws unfairly  
favor big European importers that deal with former colonies at the 
expense of Latin American producers and their American 
distributors. 
</P>
<P>
	The EU says its new import regime, which entered into force Jan.  
1, conforms with WTO rules. A WTO panel is examining the import 
laws, and EU officials argue that Washington has no right to impose 
sanctions before that panel reports back in mid-April. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. trade ambassador Rita Hayes claimed that with Friday's  
agreement, the U.S. had ``gotten exactly what they wanted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We have the authorization to go forward,'' she said, adding  
that she had always expected the EU to ask for an arbitrator. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, EU ambassador Roderick Abbott said he was not  
admitting defeat. 
</P>
<P>
	The arbitration panel is expected to report back in March. If  
the panel decides to allow sanctions, the WTO's dispute body would 
still have to grant final approval, although this should be 
automatic. 
</P>
<P>
	Fears are growing that the rancor over the banana issue could  
cause severe harm to the WTO, which champions free trade worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	WTO director-general Renato Ruggiero, who has been spearheading  
attempts to reach a compromise between the two powers, said after 
Friday's meeting that the result was ``a victory for the system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a strong organization, this isn't a weak  
organization,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Super Bowl Notebook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- The sporty footwear Jessie Tuggle will wear in the  
Super Bowl isn't meant as a fashion statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL gave the Atlanta linebacker permission to wear a new  
shoe designed to prevent ankle roll-over, the most common foot 
injury in football. 
</P>
<P>
	It will look like he's wearing black boots instead of  
traditional football cleats. 
</P>
<P>
	Former NFL tight end Don Hasselbeck helped develop the footwear  
for Reebok, which will make what it calls the Shroud ASD (ankle 
support device) shoe available to the public in July. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasselbeck was a member of the 1983 Los Angeles Raiders, who won  
the Super Bowl. He also played for the New England Patriots and New 
York Giants. 
</P>
<P>
	He met individually with many players this week to discuss shoe  
preference for natural grass and size them for cleats they will 
wear in Sunday's game.

<P>
	COIN TOSS:@ Members of the 1958 Baltimore Colts and New York  
Giants, who participated in what many consider ``The Greatest Game 
Ever Played,'' will participate in the coin toss before Sunday's 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall of Famers Raymond Berry, Lenny Moore, Art Donovan and Gino  
Marchetti plan to represent the Colts, who beat the Giants 23-17 in 
overtime in the 1958 championship game. 
</P>
<P>
	Frank Gifford, Roosevelt Brown, Sam Huff, Tom Landry, Don  
Maynard and Andy Robustelli will represent New York. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	NO GRUDGE:@ Denver wide receiver Ed McCaffrey has blossomed  
since being cut by then-New York Giants coach Dan Reeves before the 
1994 season. Reeves has since said it is one of the biggest 
personnel mistakes he ever made. 
</P>
<P>
	McCaffrey, who had 64 receptions for 1,053 yards and 10  
touchdowns for the Broncos this season, said he has no hard 
feelings against his former coach. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never took it personally. It was a business decision on his  
part,'' McCaffrey said. ``After the statement he's made this year 
in terms of regretting releasing me, that's one of the biggest 
compliments I've ever been paid in my career. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no personal grudge. Obviously I want to win the game.  
I want to play well for numerous reasons. There's no grudge.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	QB ADVANTAGE:@ Chris Chandler doesn't buy the argument that  
Atlanta has the advantage at quarterback because he had a better 
season statistically than Denver's John Elway. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's something I don't think anybody can really say and back  
up,'' Chandler said. ``John Elway is similar to Michael Jordan in 
that, regardless of how he may be playing, he could take over, turn 
it on and probably win the game for you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While there's no comparison between their career numbers,  
Chandler compiled a 100.9 quarterback rating while completing 58 
percent of his passes for 3,154 yards, 25 touchdowns and 12 
interceptions this season. Elway had a 93 rating and completed 59 
percent of his attempts for 2,806 yards, 22 TDs and 10 
interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some people feel I may have the edge, but very few people  
really know the game well. I know I've been playing quite well, and 
I'm very confident in what I can do,'' Chandler said. ``But you're 
going a little bit too far when you say that anybody is better than 
John Elway.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	REAL DEAL:@ Terrell Davis says he owes a lot of his success to  
Howard Griffith, calling Griffith the best fullback in football and 
vital to the Broncos' offense. 
</P>
<P>
	``You watch him play and it speaks for itself. If you notice the  
games that he didn't play, you can see it affected our stat sheets. 
With Howard in there, I think I'm more confident, and I feel better 
when he's in the game. When he leaves the game, it's like my shield 
is gone, even though my line does a great job of blocking. We work 
well together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Griffith appreciates the kind words.  
</P>
<P>
	``My role is tough ... I obviously don't win every play, but he  
knows that I go out with the mindset to win every play,'' the 
fullback said. ``To be good at what I do, that's what you have to 
go out and do. That way Terrell can have the confidence to go out 
and run the ball as effectively as he can.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	SNAPPY DRESSER:@ Since joining the Falcons, Reeves has abandoned  
his routine of wearing a coat and tie on game day. Part of the 
reason, he said, is it took too much effort to figure out what was 
to wear each game. Another factor was he felt he might be able to 
help sagging sales of Falcons merchandise by wearing more casual 
clothing featuring the team's logo. 
</P>
<P>
	``It had become difficult for me to dress ... I figured it was a  
good time to change,'' Reeves said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't helping me control my temper, which is the reason I  
wore a coat and tie. I thought it would calm me down some, and I 
was getting just as mad in a coat and tie as I was in the other. It 
was just a lot of reasons, and I'm glad I did it.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *FALCONS CORNERBACKS:* Atlanta cornerback Ronnie Bradford, who  
suffered a separated shoulder in the final regular season game, 
will return to the Falcons' starting lineup for the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	But expect Michael Booker to get plenty of playing time, too.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think Ronnie Bradford will start,'' Reeves said. ``He is  
back at full speed. Michael will play an awful lot, but we will 
start Ronnie Bradford.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradford started 10 games during the regular season, while  
Booker started six times when Bradford was hampered by a knee 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradford injured his shoulder Dec. 27 in a victoryover the  
Dolphins, moving Booker back into a starting role for the two 
playoff victories. Bradford didn't play in the divisional round and 
served as a nickel back in the NFC championship game. 
</P>
<P>
	``You want to get the best people out there for the most  
important game of the year,'' Booker said.

<HEADLINE> Cops: Clinic Bombing Done by Remote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) -- Hoping to dispel the notion of Eric  
Rudolph as a noble outlaw, authorities said that one year ago 
Friday he waited outside an abortion clinic with a remote control 
and detonated a deadly bomb as two people drew near. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities have said Rudolph used timers in three bombings in  
Atlanta, including the 1996 Olympic Park bombing that killed one 
person. But Friday was the first time agents confirmed a remote 
control was used at New Woman All Women Health Care in Birmingham. 
The explosion killed an off-duty police officer and severely 
wounded a nurse. 
</P>
<P>
	``Eric Rudolph is not a folk hero. He is a cold-blooded  
murderer,'' Police Chief Mike Coppage said at a news conference 
with federal agents. 
</P>
<P>
	Rudolph, a carpenter and a skilled mountaineer, disappeared  
after the Birmingham explosion on Jan. 29, 1998, and is believed to 
be hiding in the western North Carolina mountains, where he has 
taken on an almost mythic aura. 
</P>
<P>
	Anti-abortion sentiment and distrust of the federal government  
run high in the area, and many locals have said they would help 
Rudolph if he came to them. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities released details of the bombing following a memorial  
service for Robert Sanderson, the police officer who worked at the 
clinic as a security guard. 
</P>
<P>
	A trumpeter played ``Taps'' and a police honor guard laid a  
wreath of white flowers at a memorial honoring Sanderson and other 
officers killed in the line of duty. 
</P>
<P>
	Nurse Emily Lyons lost her left eye in the bombing and has  
undergone 13 operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanderson arrived to open the clinic shortly before Mrs. Lyons,  
investigators said. He approached the nail bomb, which sources have 
said was lying on the ground and disguised as a potted plant. 
</P>
<P>
	Working from a safe distance away, the bomber triggered the  
device as Sanderson stood over it, the officials said. Mrs. Lyons 
was hit with shrapnel. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sanderson was not just a bystander at an explosion meant to  
damage a building,'' U.S. Attorney Doug Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Cavanaugh, division director for the Bureau of Alcohol,  
Tobacco and Firearms, said investigators used bomb fragments to 
determine the explosion was triggered by remote. He wouldn't 
comment on whether the control device has been located.

<HEADLINE> Wizards, Strickland in Stalemate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- It seems like the lockout all over again. Both  
sides are bickering out loud, but they aren't talking to each 
other. The two seemingly intractable positions are millions of 
dollars apart. 
</P>
<P>
	And David Falk is in the middle of it all.  
</P>
<P>
	While the rest of the NBA is scrambling to fill rosters to get  
ready for the short 50-game season, the Washington Wizards have 
essentially done nothing. Their abbreviated training camp is being 
slowed by a stalemate over the re-signing of free agent point guard 
Rod Strickland, whose 10.5 assists per game led the league last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone's setting up their roster, making moves,'' Wizards  
forward Juwan Howard said. ``The championship is wide open since 
Chicago doesn't have as much talent. It's our job to do the same as 
other teams.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 14,000 fans rocked the MCI Center with the chant of ``We  
want Rod!'' when the Wizards held an open scrimmage last weekend. 
They know that Strickland and Mitch Richmond, acquired in a trade 
before the lockout, could form one of the best backcourts in the 
league. Without Strickland, they will hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	But the negotiations have gone nowhere. Two strong personalities  
are involved, and neither wants to give in. 
</P>
<P>
	The first is Falk, the super-agent who represents Michael Jordan  
and many big-name NBA players. Falk, a major behind-the-scenes 
player who took his share of blame for the prolonged lockout, 
initially asked for $65 million over five years for Strickland, 
then reduced the demand to five years, $55 million. Falk says 
that's a bargain given the going rate for top point guards. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other side is Wizards general manager Wes Unseld, who  
doesn't want to make a five-year commitment to a 32-year-old player 
who -- by his own admission -- doesn't take good care of himself. On 
the court, Strickland is superb. Otherwise, he shows up late for 
games and practices, eats hot dogs and pizza, and more than once 
has gotten sick during a game. 
</P>
<P>
	Last season, when the Wizards were trying to make a playoff run,  
Strickland tore his left quadriceps muscle and missed the final six 
games. The Wizards finished one victory away from a postseason 
berth. 
</P>
<P>
	With such questions about Strickland's durability, Unseld has  
offered a five-year, $50 million deal -- with only the first three 
years, or $27 million, guaranteed. The final two years are valid 
only if Strickland meets certain performance incentives. 
</P>
<P>
	This week, things got nasty. Falk, after saying repeatedly that  
all he wants is a ``fair deal,'' released a statement from 
Strickland in which the player asked: ``Is this any way to treat a 
productive employee because he exhibits loyalty?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unseld was angry.  
</P>
<P>
	``I hope the atmosphere hasn't been too poisoned,'' he said.  
``It's amazing what these negotiations have been relegated to. I 
have a tough time thinking that offering someone $10 million a year 
is being unfair. ... I think we're being fair.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two men haven't spoken since.  
</P>
<P>
	``If anything, he owes me a call,'' said Unseld, adding that no  
deal can be reached ``until Rod determines that Mr. Falk works for 
him and not the other way around.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With a week to go before the start of the season, it's evident  
that the Wizards and Strickland desperately need each other. 
Because of the salary cap, no other team can or will pay Strickland 
anything close to what he can get from the Wizards. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wizards, already with a track record of bitter contract  
talks involving Howard, Rex Chapman and Tom Gugliotta, are in 
danger of earning a reputation as an organization that doesn't want 
to pay for a winning team. Washington hasn't won a playoff series 
since 1982.

<HEADLINE> NFL: Instant Replay Return Likely </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- This time, instant replay is likely to be back,  
even though commissioner Paul Tagliabue declines to acknowledge 
that the NFL had officiating problems this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Tagliabue made the prediction at his annual Super Bowl news  
conference Friday, although he said that criticism of officials 
this year was overblown. 
</P>
<P>
	`I think we succeeded in shooting ourselves in the foot by  
jumping on the officials with our network partners in ways that 
were unfair,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But he added:  
</P>
<P>
	``We will look at all aspects of officiating. We are not going  
to look at it with rose-colored glasses, but I don't think we need 
to view the issues any differently than we have in the past.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an hour-long Super Bowl news conference, Tagliabue addressed  
a wide range of issues, including instant replay, which he once 
again said should be back next season. 
</P>
<P>
	He also made a firm commitment to Lawrence Taylor's candidacy  
for the Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	The 10-time Pro Bowl linebacker for the New York Giants would be  
an automatic pick in his first year of eligibility if not for a 
series of drug-related arrests and one suspension during his 
career. 
</P>
<P>
	Tagliabue noted that league officials and the Giants, headed by  
owner Wellington Mara, have been trying to help Taylor overcome his 
substance abuse problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Hall is about performance on the field,'' he said.  
``Lawrence was one of the greatest players ever. I think the public 
understands that by making a judgment on what he did on the field, 
you're not judging what he did off it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor must get 29 of the 36 votes from media members on  
Saturday to ensure his election. 
</P>
<P>
	Tagliabue also said:  
</P>
<P>
	-- The NFL was making progress in hiring minority coaches even  
though just one of the 25 head coaching vacancies in the past three 
years has been filled by a black coach. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were one game away from a Super Bowl with a black coach, a  
black quarterback and black personnel executives,'' Tagliabue said, 
referring to the Minnesota Vikings, who lost to Atlanta in the NFC 
championship game. ``We think we've made a lot of progress getting 
minorities in the loop.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-- San Francisco owner Edward DeBartolo Jr., who has pleaded  
guilty to failing to report a felony and fined $2 million, will not 
be reinstated for the 1999 season. Instead, Tagliabue said, 
DeBartolo's sister, Denise DeBartolo York, has agreed to continue 
to run the team. 
</P>
<P>
	But he acknowledged that DeBartolo probably had a say in the  
recent decision to bring back Bill Walsh as general manager. ``I 
may be a lot of things, but I'm not naive or dumb,'' Tagliabue 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	As for replay, Tagliabue said he was almost certain it would be  
approved in some form at the league's March meetings. 
</P>
<P>
	He said league officials are studying devices with digital  
replay capability that could be used to make quick decisions. But 
he said there will still be debates about whether to use a coaches' 
challenge system or return to a system used from 1986-91, when a 
replay official in a booth would spot calls to be reviewed. 
</P>
<P>
	One reason replay has failed to pass during the last few  
meetings was the lack of consensus among coaches on a system. Many 
dislike the challenge system because it would require a quick 
decision that would cost them a time out if they were wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	But Tagliabue said some coaches were coming around on the  
challenge system, and he hopes a consensus can be reached when the 
competition committee meets before the owners convene. 
</P>
<P>
	``Coaches make quick decisions all the time,'' he said. ``That's  
one of the things that makes a good coach.''

<HEADLINE> Meat Processing Plants Amend Recall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two meat processing plants that already have  
recalled some products possibly contaminated with a sometimes fatal 
bacteria have made some additions and changes to their recall 
lists. 
</P>
<P>
	The Agriculture Department said Thursday that Bil Mar Foods, a  
Zeeland, Mich., meat processing plant, has added more brands to its 
December 22 recall of hot dogs and luncheon meats. 
</P>
<P>
	These added products were not believed to have been sold at  
retail at the time of the original recall. All products are 
identified by the Bil Mar establishment codes of ``EST 6911'' or 
``P-261.'' The recalled products are listed below. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumption of food with Listeria monocytogenes bacteria can  
cause listeriosis. Healthy people usually can fight off the 
bacterium with no more than flu-like symptoms. But listeria can 
kill, by causing meningitis or blood infection. Most at risk are 
pregnant women, the elderly and people with weak immune systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Those concerned about illnesses they suspect are related to  
these products should contact their physicians immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported earlier  
this week that the death toll from tainted meat linked to the 
Michigan plant has risen to 12. Bil Mar is a subsidiary of the 
Chicago-based Sara Lee Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Thorn Apple Valley, a Forrest City, Ark., processing plant last  
week announced a recall of 30 million pounds of meat produced from 
July 1998 to December 1998. It includes all meat and poultry 
products bearing the codes ``EST 13529'' or ``EST P13529'' anywhere 
on the package. Since then, the company provided the department 
with an amended list of products, given below. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas Billy, administrator of the Food Safety and Inspection  
Service, said consumers should check their freezers and fridges and 
not eat products from the two plants. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers can contact Bil Mar at 1-800-247-8339 and Thorn Apple  
Valley at 1-800-839-2427. Consumers with food safety questions may 
phone the USDA Meat and Poultry Hotline at 1-800-535-4555. The 
hotline is staffed from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. EST Monday through 
Friday. Recorded information is available 24 hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
	Additional Bil Mar brands being recalled:  
</P>
<P>
	Allen's Pride (sold only in St. Louis): Allen's Pride Medium  
Cooked Beef Split Top Round (typically sold in frozen packages 
weighing from seven to 10 pounds). 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon Food Service (a Midwest regional distributor and operator  
of 70 Marketplace retail stores in Michigan, Indiana, Ohio and 
Illinois): GFS Cooked Whole turkey Breast, GFS Turkey Franks 8/lb,

<HEADLINE> Three Sentenced in Asbestos Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MADISON, Wis. (AP) -- Three men who hired inadequately trained  
homeless men to remove cancer-causing asbestos from a factory have 
been sentenced to prison. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Barbara Crabb on Thursday ordered Buddy  
Vernon Frazier, 35, of Chattanooga, Tenn., to serve two years and 
six months in a federal prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Chance Gaines, 25, of Arab, Ala., was sentenced to two years and  
nine months. Frazier's nephew, James E. Bragg, 24, of Chattanooga, 
received two years. 
</P>
<P>
	The three pleaded guilty to conspiring to violate the federal  
Clean Air Act and use false Social Security numbers to get asbestos 
worker certification for the men. 
</P>
<P>
	Gaines and Bragg, working for Frazier, brought the untrained  
workers from Georgia and Tennessee to Wisconsin, obtaining false 
identification for them, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	Asbestos was widely used during the 1940s and 1950s for  
insulation in factories, ships and power plants before it was known 
that it could cause lung cancer.

<HEADLINE> Tunnel Collapses in Oregon, 1 Dead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TIMBER, Ore. (AP) -- As rocks and dirt rained over him, David  
Gattuccio struggled to dig out his boss who was calling for help 
from beneath a pile of debris in a collapsed tunnel on U.S. Highway 
26. 
</P>
<P>
	Gattuccio couldn't get there in time. Dennis L. Edwards, a  
25-year veteran with the Oregon Department of Transportation, died 
Thursday after being crushed in the cave-in of the tunnel's 
waterlogged roof. 
</P>
<P>
	``We tried,'' said Gattuccio, 33, who suffered minor injuries.  
``I guess God wanted him home today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Transportation officials said the bridge crew was working at the  
eastern end of the two-lane Sunset Tunnel when the sheet 
metal-and-timber roof suddenly gave way shortly after noon. 
Edwards, 49, was in a cherry picker bucket inspecting the roof. 
</P>
<P>
	Agency spokesman Dave Davis said the arched tunnel has heavy  
wooden timbers supporting the interior, and some workers were 
tapping on them to detect weaknesses and determine whether to add 
new timbers. 
</P>
<P>
	The 60-year-old tunnel goes through a sloping hillside at the  
1,200-foot level of the Coast Range, 27 miles northwest of 
Portland. 
</P>
<P>
	Hours after the accident, crews were able to reach Edwards'  
body, which was buried beneath an estimated three to four tons of 
dirt and debris in the mist-shrouded tunnel. It's the only 
wood-braced tunnel still in regular use on Oregon highways. 
</P>
<P>
	The collapse shut down traffic in both directions along the key  
route between Portland and the Oregon coast. 
</P>
<P>
	The area has been hit by days of steady rainfall, with more than  
an inch in the 12 hours prior to the collapse. 
</P>
<P>
	The 800-foot tunnel was surveyed twice last year, the first time  
in September when an inspector noticed rotting wood near the 
concrete entrances of the tunnel.

<HEADLINE> Failed Suicide Blows Up Building </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- A man whose bungled suicide attempt blew apart  
a portion of an apartment complex was ordered to stand trial on two 
felony counts stemming from the explosion. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael McGilbra apparently tried to kill himself by opening a  
gas valve and inhaling the fumes. He fell asleep, and when he woke 
up lit a cigarette with the intent to blow himself up, Special 
Agent Daniel Heenan from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and 
Firearms testified at a hearing Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The resulting blast tore the roof off a building, destroyed or  
damaged several units, and knocked McGilbra unconscious. 
</P>
<P>
	He was hospitalized in a burn unit for several days after the  
Jan. 4 explosion for treatment of second-degree facial burns. 
Damage was estimated at $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Three children were cut by flying glass, but there were no major  
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	McGilbra, 40, was ordered to stand trial after Thursday's  
hearing. He sat in court in shackles and peering through thick 
glasses. He declined to take the witness stand. 
</P>
<P>
	A Feb. 11 arraignment date was set on felony charges of  
endangering property by explosives and malicious injury to private 
property.

<HEADLINE> Welfare Eyed at U.S. Mayors Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A government study showing the number of  
welfare recipients finding work has slowed dramatically comes as no 
surprise to city leaders at the U.S. Conference of Mayors meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	But for municipal officials from tiny East Point City, Ga., to  
Detroit, anticipating the slowdown provides little comfort as they 
search to find work for the hard-core unemployed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was impressed with the early numbers of people who moved off  
welfare, but I also knew it couldn't last,'' said Pasty J. 
Hilliard, mayor of East Point City, a town of 35,000 outside 
Atlanta. ``This is where the hard work will start.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Detroit Mayor Dennis Archer said increased aid for job training,  
child care and transportation will be key in moving the chronically 
unemployed to work. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many of the people who are still on welfare have been away  
from the world of work so long, they don't have the basic skills 
employers need,'' Archer said. ``This will be a major challenge for 
all of us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Interviews with mayors at the conference amplify the findings of  
the recent government report showing a sharp decline in the numbers 
of people moving from welfare to work. 
</P>
<P>
	Nationally, just under 8 million people remained on welfare at  
the end of September, down 44 percent from 14.3 million in 1994, 
President Clinton announced earlier this week. But the trend is 
slowing. 
</P>
<P>
	Kansas, which has cut its welfare rolls by 62 percent since  
1993, saw quarterly declines of 8 percent to 10 percent slow to 1.7 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In Arkansas, welfare rolls fell just 2.7 percent in the last  
quarter of fiscal 1998 after drops of about 9 percent in previous 
quarters. 
</P>
<P>
	Other states seeing dropoffs include Arizona, Connecticut,  
Florida, Massachusetts and North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	Some officials, such as Mayor Paul Helmke of Fort Wayne Ind.,  
expressed frustration with the current system of federal funds that 
pass through the hands of state legislators, who have wide latitude 
in determining how the money is spent. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are the ones closest to the problems. We see where our  
greatest needs are but we don't get the money directly,'' Helmke 
said. ``Especially now at a time when the welfare rolls aren't 
shrinking as fast as they were before, local leaders ought to 
decide where the money goes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New Orleans Mayor Marc Morial said helping hard-core welfare  
recipients is going to be costly because many have problems with 
substance abuse and lack of education. 
</P>
<P>
	``Policy-makers have to be prepared to open the coffers if they  
really want to address the problem,'' Morial said. ``We can't talk 
their way out of this.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	LAWRENCE, Kan. (AP) -- Maurice Greene, the world indoor  
record-holder at 60 meters, tied the mark for the fastest time in 
the United States on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene ran 6.46 seconds in the finals at the University of  
Kansas, equaling the mark he set early last year at the Millrose 
Games in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene ran 6.51 in Friday's preliminaries.  
</P>
<P>
	Greene, also the world outdoor 100-meter champion, has said that  
1999 is the year he wants to smash his own 60-meter world-record 
mark of 6.39, set in Madrid, Spain, last February. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've set some goals and I'm confident I can achieve them,''  
Greene said earlier this week. ``I'm going for the record every 
time I step on the track.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greene, a Kansas City, Kan., native, was running in the Jayhawk  
Invitational track and field meet in the Anschutz Pavilion.

<HEADLINE> Notre Dame Contemplates Big Ten </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP) -- Bob Davie likes a national schedule,  
unmatched exposure and the multimillion-dollar TV contract that 
goes with Notre Dame's independence. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Fighting Irish coach also knows it's becoming more  
difficult to stand alone in college football, especially as more 
bowls align themselves with conferences. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, Notre Dame took a 6-4-1 record to the Fiesta Bowl, and  
the next year, the 9-2 Irish made the Orange Bowl. This season, 
however, a 9-2 record qualified the team for a spot in the 
second-tier Gator Bowl, because of an agreement with the Big East 
to participate in its bowl rotation. 
</P>
<P>
	Without that agreement, Davie joked, the Irish might have faced  
played in the Music City or Motor City bowls. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's why I think there's a point where you face reality,''  
Davie said. 
</P>
<P>
	It's also part of the reason Notre Dame is considering ending  
its 111-year history as a football independent by joining the Big 
Ten. The decision could affect revenues while potentially 
threatening Notre Dame's reputation as a national, independent, 
Roman Catholic university -- both academically and athletically. 
</P>
<P>
	Which way the university will go could be determined Feb. 5,  
when the its president, the Rev. Edward A. Malloy, presents a 
recommendation to the Board of Trustees a recommendation on 
affiliation with the Big Ten. 
</P>
<P>
	Several ``competitive and financial'' issues still need to be  
hashed out before a formal invitation to join the Big Ten could be 
extended, said conference commissioner Jim Delaney. 
</P>
<P>
	But if the Trustees approve the proposed alignment, the two  
sides would get together to hammer out the details. The university 
would sever its four-year association with the Big East Conference 
in sports other than football. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they're workable if both parties want them to work,''  
Delaney said. ``Through our discussions, creative people and people 
who understand what's going on can find a way for both sides to be 
satisfied.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bottom line for Notre Dame, at least athletically, is how  
the change would affect the football program, said athletic 
director Mike Wadsworth. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only thing we're really addressing here is the extent to  
which the athletic department is advanced or not by virtue of our 
football program changing its status,'' Wadsworth said. ``That's an 
issue where we take into account all the factors you've talked 
about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While negotiations between the school and conference are secret  
because of a confidentiality agreement both signed, money is 
believed to be one of the key components to an alliance. 
</P>
<P>
	Five years ago, the Big Ten approached Notre Dame about joining  
the conference. But the talks never turned serious. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, when the conference again hinted at the possibility  
of alignment, school officials were hesitant until discovering such 
a move wouldn't be as financially detrimental to the athletic 
department as once thought. 
</P>
<P>
	As an independent, Notre Dame takes home every cent of its gate  
receipts, all proceeds from a bowl payout and an estimated $7 
million a year in its exclusive TV contract with NBC. That income 
is expected to jump to $8 million a year for the 2000-2005 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	But as a member of the Big Ten, Notre Dame would enter a  
revenue-sharing program that splits a portion of each school's gate 
receipts from football and basketball, bowl revenues, TV contracts 
and proceeds from the NCAA basketball tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	During the bowl season, the conference grossed about $25  
million, with $19 million spread evenly among 11 members. The rest 
was split among the five schools that played in bowl games. 
</P>
<P>
	The conference also offers Notre Dame more security in obtaining  
a decent bowl bid -- six bowls currently have agreements to take Big 
10 teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``Regardless of whether you're up or you're down, those bowl  
revenues are there,'' Delaney said. ``Whether you in the Rose Bowl 
or not, you get the money. Whether you're on ESPN or not, you get 
money. 
</P>
<P>
	``So, basically it's a shared risk, shared upside, shared  
downside. Those revenues have grown approximately from $18 million 
10 years ago to over $70 million today, and will be up over $100 
million in two to three years. That's the big picture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the many unknowns is whether football recruiting would be  
hurt by losing the NBC contract, which gives the network exclusive 
rights to broadcast Notre Dame's home games through the 2005 
season. Coaches use television as a way to lure college recruits to 
Notre Dame, promising them national exposure for half their games 
every season. 
</P>
<P>
	By joining the Big Ten, Notre Dame would surrender its rights to  
independently negotiate a TV contract, Wadsworth said. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, Notre Dame would be a part of the Big Ten contract with  
ABC that shows games mostly on a regional basis and runs through 
2006, the first year Wadsworth said the football team would be able 
to begin conference play. All other sports would be able to join 
the conference by 2000-01 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever losses Notre Dame would incur through conference  
affiliation would be offset by other factors, Wadsworth said. That 
includes reduced travel time for Irish teams now playing in the Big 
East, where the nearest school is more than 350 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bottom line of which is that there is no economic  
advantage and no material economic disadvantage,'' Wadsworth said. 
</P>
<P>
	But joining the conference could have other implications for  
Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
	Membership in the Big Ten also means affiliation with its  
academic arm, the Committee on Intercollegiate Cooperation, an 
alliance among conference schools and the University of Chicago 
that allows them to share information and research materials. 
</P>
<P>
	Notre Dame, which has traditionally stressed its undergraduate  
programs, is behind Big Ten schools in research and graduate 
programs. Still, many alumni are opposed to such an alliance, 
fearing it would damage Notre Dame's undergraduate programs and 
identify as an independent, Catholic university. 
</P>
<P>
	As the vote has grown near, students have taken to chanting ``No  
Big Ten'' during basketball games, and several held aloft a banner 
during a recent game with a message for Wadsworth and Malloy: ``Hey 
Mike, Monk: Stay Irish. No Big Ten.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Football kind of put Notre Dame on the map to start with,''  
said Jim Farrell, the school's senior class president. ``I don't 
think Notre Dame has to join the Big Ten to be successful. If Notre 
Dame was 11-0 last year, you wouldn't have heard any need for them 
to join the Big Ten.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Changing the status is particularly sensitive for Wadsworth, who  
played football at Notre Dame from 1963-65 and was part of the 1964 
national championship squad. He said his personal and private 
feelings on Big Ten affiliation are the same, and after asked if 
playing for Notre Dame as a Big Ten school rather than an 
independent would have changed the experience for him, Wadsworth 
paused for a moment and smirked. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I answer that question, I'm probably disclosing where I  
come out on this thing, so I can't do that,'' he said. ``Looking at 
the traditional issues, those traditional issues continue to 
indicate maintaining the football program as an independent for 
those reasons. We also have to look forward.''

<HEADLINE> IOC Chief Quits As Spain Bank Head </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BARCELONA, Spain (AP) -- Juan Antonio Samaranch resigned as  
president of a leading Spainish bank, but denied today the action 
had anything to do with the corruption scandal in the IOC, which he 
heads. 
</P>
<P>
		   The 78-year-old Samaranch told a news conference he would not be  
a candidate for another four-year term as head of Spain's fourth 
banking entity, La Caixa, but will become honorary president. 
</P>
<P>
	News reports said he announced the decision at a La Caixa board  
meeting Thursday and gave his age as the reason he had decided not 
to seek another four-year term. 
</P>
<P>
	Answering reporters questions on whether the decision had  
anything to do with the Olympic corruption scandal, Samaranch said: 
``Those who think it influenced (me) are wrong. This decision was 
taken a long way back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said he did not believe the decision ``would weaken my  
position where it matters, which is before the IOC members.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He admitted that the move might not appear to come at the best  
time, but he emphasized it was not a decision he arrived at in the 
last few days but had discussed it with his successor more than a 
year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch was elected president of La Caixa in 1987, seven years  
after he took over as head of the International Olympic Committee.

<HEADLINE> Wheat Ends Up; Corn, Soybeans Down / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Soybean and corn futures retreated Friday on the  
Chicago Board of Trade, while wheat futures advanced. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans fell to new 11 1/2-year lows as beneficial rain fell in  
Brazilian growing regions, boosting expectations that farmers there 
will harvest bumper crops. That would come at a time when economic 
troubles have sharply reduced U.S. export demand and amid 
expectations U.S. farmers this spring will plant more acres to 
soybeans than corn and wheat. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn futures moved lower in step with soybeans and as rains  
benefited competing corn crops in Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures shook off weakness tied to beneficial rains in  
winter wheat growing regions on expectations Egypt, one of the 
largest purchasers of U.S. wheat, would buy a large quantity over 
the weekend. Such a sale would boost demand. Investors also worried 
that warmer temperatures in winter wheat regions would leave them 
vulnerable to a late-season cold snap. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for March delivery rose 2 1/4 cents to $2.75 1/2 a bushel; March  
corn fell 1 1/2 cents to $2.14 1/2 a bushel; March oats fell 1/4 cent to 
$1.06 1/4 a bushel; March soybeans fell 3 1/2 cents to $5.06 3/4 a bushel.

	Beef futures finished mixed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,  
while pork futures retreated amid concern about weak slaughterhouse 
operations.

feeder cattle fell .32 cent to 72.60 cents a pound; February pork

<HEADLINE> Christian Groups To Boycott Arafat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Citing concern for Israel, leaders of  
conservative Christian groups say they will boycott the upcoming 
National Prayer Breakfast to which Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat 
has been invited. 
</P>
<P>
	Leaders of the Christian Coalition and the Traditional Values  
Coalition have demanded that the organizers of the breakfast next 
Thursday rescind their invitation to Arafat, who has been invited 
three times but accepted only this year, The Washington Post 
reported today. Leaders of the Christian groups also are urging 
members of Congress not to attend, it said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Inviting Arafat means embracing a man with blood on his hands.  
And I find that disturbing,'' said Randy Tate, executive director 
of the Christian Coalition. 
</P>
<P>
	The prayer breakfast, attended annually by about 3,500  
politicians, diplomats and religious leaders, is being coordinated 
this year by Rep. Steve Largent, R-Okla., a close ally of the 
religious groups. 
</P>
<P>
	Largent told the Post that he did not personally invite Arafat,  
but he will not rescind the invitation. He did, however, ask 
President Clinton on Friday not to meet with Arafat during the 
event, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman David Leavy said Clinton intended to have  
a ``conversation'' with Arafat during the breakfast. The president 
would urge Arafat to fulfill his obligation to cooperate with 
Israel and work against violence, Leavy said.

<HEADLINE> Hearst Close To Talk Magazine Stake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The publisher of Good Housekeeping and Esquire  
may soon become a partner in this year's most talked-about new 
magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	Hearst Corp. is close to reaching a deal for part ownership of  
Talk, the magazine being developed by Miramax Films and former New 
Yorker editor Tina Brown, according to sources familiar with the 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	Talk's fall debut should generate enormous public interest given  
Brown's controversial six-year run as editor of The New Yorker and 
Miramax's growing stature in Hollywood. Hearst would offer the 
added benefit of expertise in publishing and distributing 
magazines, in addition to financial backing. 
</P>
<P>
	Hearst's board is considering the proposal and a deal could be  
announced within a week, the sources said Thursday, speaking on 
condition of anonymity. It was unclear how big Hearst's ownership 
stake might be, and the deal could still possibly fall through. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesmen for Miramax and Hearst in New York both declined  
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Miramax, the studio behind the ``Scream'' films and ``The  
English Patient,'' is owned by Walt Disney Co., which already has 
several ventures with Hearst. The publisher owns stakes in Disney's 
ESPN cable sports network and magazine, and the two companies 
co-own the Lifetime and A&AMP;E cable networks. 
</P>
<P>
	A union with Hearst would give Talk access to Hearst's huge  
database of subscribers and the benefit of its long-standing 
relationships with advertisers and newsstands. 
</P>
<P>
	For its part, Hearst would gain a stake in a celebrity-filled  
general interest magazine to compete with the likes of Vanity Fair, 
another magazine formerly edited by Brown and published by rival 
Conde Nast Publications. 
</P>
<P>
	Hearst already has a strong collection of special-interest  
magazines such as Cosmopolitan, Popular Mechanics, Redbook, Town &AMP; 
Country and SmartMoney. 
</P>
<P>
	Plans to launch Talk magazine were announced in July, when Brown  
stepped down as editor of The New Yorker. Critics complained that 
she drowned the literary magazine in glitz, while others lauded her 
for breathing life into the venerable publication. The New Yorker's 
circulation grew under Brown's stewardship. 
</P>
<P>
	Vogue publisher Ronald Galotti also left Conde Nast -- both  
magazines' parent company -- to join Brown and Miramax in the 
venture. The new company, Talk Media, includes book publishing and 
TV production operations in addition to the magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	Hearst is the nation's third-largest magazine publisher behind  
Time Inc. and Conde Nast. The privately held company also has 
interests in book and newspaper publishing, broadcasting and 
Internet ventures. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate deal announced Thursday, Hearst is teaming with a  
company called Women.com Networks to create an online women's 
network. The network will combine the Women.com and HomeArts.com 
sites with links to the sites of 11 women's magazines owned by

<HEADLINE> Super Bowl Scribes Trash Miami </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- The Denver Broncos and Atlanta Falcons are  
fortunate to be here, fighting for the NFL championship. Their 
hometown newspapers believe they'll be lucky if they make it home 
alive. 
</P>
<P>
	Not that the Super Bowl is going to kill them, the newspapers  
say, but the gun-toting drug dealers and criminals that prey on 
out-of-towners might. 
</P>
<P>
	Cities competing for a sports championship usually take pot  
shots at each other. This time, they have their host in the 
crosshairs -- and the hometown newspaper is directing the shots. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most people never get out of here alive,'' Woody Paige wrote  
in a scathing column in The Denver Post. ``Miami, where the slogan 
is: 'Your CD player, your money and your life, por favor.''' 
</P>
<P>
	And that was before he got nasty.  
</P>
<P>
	``Wear a sign that states (emphatically): 'I AM NOT A TOURIST.  
DON'T KILL ME, POR FAVOR,''' Paige wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	He isn't alone.  
</P>
<P>
	``Could the NFL have picked a city more squalidly symbolic of  
all that blights humanity? What? Was Baghdad already booked?'' 
Jeffry Scott of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution wrote in a special 
column for The Miami Herald. 
</P>
<P>
	Herald columnist Carl Hiaasen also got into the act.  
</P>
<P>
	``Statistically, Super Bowl Sunday is one of the quietest days  
of the year for drug assassinations in the Greater Miami area,'' 
Hiaasen wrote. ``That's because most of our top smugglers are 
peacefully preoccupied, watching the big game from their private 
skyboxes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And so keyboards have become automatic assault rifles, firing  
round after round. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's too easy,'' said Dick Kreck of The Denver Post, who also  
ripped into Miami in a column published in the Herald. ``It's like 
shooting manatees in a barrel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forget that Miami's crime rate is down to 1979 levels. Denver  
and Atlanta columnists are more interested in its reputation for 
murder and corruption. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Miami didn't have sun, it would be New Jersey. This is a  
Third World country,'' Paige said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't go to many places where they tell you at the  
rent-a-car counter, 'If you get in an accident, get the hell out of 
there,''' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The local NBC-TV affiliate dubbed the bashing ``Super Slam.''  
</P>
<P>
	Aides to Miami-Dade County Mayor Alex Penelas had a more pointed  
response to Paige's column. 
</P>
<P>
	``We printed it up and enlarged it and put it on our wall and  
are throwing darts at it,'' said spokesman Juan Mendieta. 
</P>
<P>
	Penelas took umbrage at the hard knocks.  
</P>
<P>
	``The fact is that we are a multicultural community,'' he said.  
``We have become the envy of a lot of other cities for being the 
capital of the Americas, and some people don't like that, and so be 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Spanish American League Against Discrimination was livid at  
Paige. 
</P>
<P>
	``People like this gentleman look at Hispanics like second-class  
citizens,'' said chairman Osvaldo Soto. ``But they have realized 
that Hispanics here through their efforts have gotten where they 
have gotten and done what we have done and they resent us for 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kreck said he loved the city, despite writing that ``Miami is an  
international destination for tourists, many of whom never get the 
chance -- and this is unfortunate -- to use the second half of their 
round-trip tickets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``To tell you the truth,'' he said from Denver, ``it was  
difficult to work up a mean spirit about the place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Scott said he was egged on.  
</P>
<P>
	``The Herald just called me up and asked me if I'd be interested  
in writing a story about Miami and I said, 'I don't know much about 
Miami' and they said 'That's even better,''' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hiaasen has poked fun at Miami for years.  
</P>
<P>
	``There's still enough weirdness here that it is not a typical  
urban area of the United States,'' he said. ``The (1997 Gianni) 
Versace murder is classic. To have a fashion designer stalked and 
assassinated is bizarre. It's not going to happy in Tulsa.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hiaasen said his column was just part of the usual Super Bowl  
hype, but if his work keeps people from flocking to the area, 
that's fine with him. 
</P>
<P>
	``My goal is to scare as many people away as I possibly can. To  
have them running screaming at 100 mph on I-95 northbound,'' he 
said. ``I'll be deeply worried if the Chamber of Commerce liked 
anything I wrote. I would be very worried about the quality of my 
work if they were fans of mine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Paige certainly didn't win any friends in this oft-pilloried  
so-called Third World banana republic. He said he received death 
threats and enough hate e-mail to keep himself planted firmly at 
his computer. 
</P>
<P>
	And he has a message for those who threaten his life.  
</P>
<P>
	``Why do they care what an idiot like me from Colorado thinks  
about Miami?'' he said. ``I am trailer trash from Colorado.''

	Reno Rejects Ickes Probe  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Attorney General Janet Reno today rejected  
calling an independent counsel to investigate former White House 
aide Harold Ickes on perjury charges. Today was the last day of 
Reno's six-month-long review of an allegation that Ickes lied 
before a Senate inquiry into campaign finances. Reno concluded that 
there was ``no reasonable basis'' to believe any additional 
investigation would turn up new evidence to prove that Ickes' 
testimony was ``knowingly and intentionally false.''

	Senate Delivering Trial Subpoenas  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate began delivering subpoenas today  
for Monica Lewinsky and two others who will testify next week in 
depositions for President Clinton's impeachment trial. Long-time 
Clinton friend Vernon Jordan and aide Sidney Blumenthal will also 
testify. GOP senators have promised that -- unless more witnesses 
are called -- the trial will end by Feb. 12 with a vote on perjury 
and obstruction of justice charges against Clinton.

	Ex-Tripp Lawyer Sought for Query  
</P>
<P>
	ELLICOTT CITY, Md. (AP) -- Prosecutors asked a judge to force one  
of Linda Tripp's former lawyers to answer questions about tapes his 
ex-client made of conversations with Monica Lewinsky. James Moody 
invoked attorney-client privilege and his Fifth Amendment rights in 
refusing to answer questions about the tapes' existence and 
whereabouts. The grand jury is investigating whether Mrs. Tripp 
broke Maryland's wiretap law, which makes it illegal to audiotape a 
conversation without another person's consent.

	Cops: Clinic Bombing Done by Remote  
</P>
<P>
	BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) -- Authorities tried today to discredit  
suspected abortion clinic bomber Eric Rudolph, saying the fugitive 
had waited with a remote control and detonated a bomb as two people 
drew near. ``Eric Rudolph is not a folk hero,'' a police spokesman 
said. Authorities said Rudolph, who is believed to be hiding in the 
mountains of North Carolina, used timers in three bombings in 
Atlanta, including the 1996 Olympic Park bombing that killed one 
person. Anti-abortion sentiment and distrust of the federal 
government run high in the North Carolina mountains, where many 
locals have said they would help Rudolph if he came to them.

	Major Airlines Raise Fares  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Several major airlines raised fares by up to 4  
percent today in what could signal the first across-the-board hike 
in 18 months. Delta Air Lines was the first to raise prices on 
business tickets by 2 percent and leisure tickets by 4 percent, a 
move that was quickly matched by Northwest Airlines, Continental 
Airlines and America West Airlines. Last September, an attempt by 
airlines to raise prices was rescinded in 36 hours because 
Northwest, facing the threat of a pilots' strike, rolled back the 
increase.

	Defendant Weds Witness, Ends Case  
</P>
<P>
	SPRINGFIELD, Mass. (AP) -- A man charged with vehicular homicide  
married the only witness against him just before his trial, 
effectively ending the case. A judge dismissed charges against 
Michael Vega after his bride, Antoinette Marie Joseph, refused to 
testify. The judge called the timing of the marriage ``a terrible 
violation of ordinary moral decency.'' Last June, Vega was riding 
with Joseph and arguing with her when he allegedly grabbed the 
wheel. The car swerved into the path of an oncoming vehicle and 
struck an oncoming car, killing the driver, prosecutors said.

	NFL Boss Backs LT for Hall of Fame  
</P>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue today gave former  
Giants linebacker Lawrence Taylor a boost in a bid for the Pro 
Football Hall of Fame, saying induction is all about ``performance 
on the field.'' Taylor, considered one of the greatest players at 
his position in the history of the sport, would be an automatic 
pick in his first year of eligibility if not for a series of 
drug-related arrests and one suspension during his career. 
Tagliabue said league officials have been trying to help Taylor 
overcome his substance abuse problems.

<HEADLINE> Super Bowl Quotes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Quotes from Super Bowl players and coaches Friday:  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``The Hall is about performance on the field. Lawrence was one  
of the greatest players ever. I think the public understands that 
by making a judgment on what he did on the field, you're not 
judging what he did off it.'' -- NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue, on 
favoring election of former Giants star to Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``If you take Shannon Sharpe out of the equation, we have been  
very quiet. Now if we didn't have Shannon Sharpe, there would be 
everybody in this room complaining about there was nothing exciting 
to write about or talk about,'' -- Broncos coach Mike Shanahan on 
trash-talking that's highlighted Super Bowl week. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``I watched the Ice Bowl game the other day, or the other night,  
actually. I couldn't sleep. Those stories have gotten so much 
better through the years. I am a much better player than I was back 
in 1965. So it's amazing to hear some of the stories.'' -- Falcons 
coach Dan Reeves, reflecting on the 1967 NFL title game he played 
in for the Dallas Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``This week is so much bigger than me. This is about all the  
former players that played here in Atlanta ... like Mike Kenn and 
Jeff Van Note and Joel Williams and Buddy Curry, the guys who never 
had the opportunity to experience what I'm experiencing throughout 
their time in Atlanta. This is for the city of Atlanta -- they've 
been waiting for this for so long. This is for the Smith family 
(who own the team) and the whole organization. This is large. This 
is something we've all dreamed about and talked about and this is 
something that we really want.'' -- Falcons LB Jessie Tuggle, who's 
waited 12 years to play in a Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Jessie won't say it, but if Jessie Tuggle was anywhere else  
the last 12 years, he'd be a guaranteed Hall of Famer, no questions 
asked. ... He's always overlooked, but there's not a linebacker 
who's played better than Jessie Tuggle since I've been in the 
league.'' -- Falcons DE Chuck Smith. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``You'd always love to go out as a winner, to have your last  
game be the Super Bowl and be able to play well. That would be 
great. ``Then, again, no one's ever done it three times in a row. 
If we get a win here, it would throw a little kink into my 
thinking. It would give me something to think about.'' -- Broncos QB 
John Elway, on the prospect of returning for another season. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we have the same cool-calm that I spoke about with  
some friends before the (NFC) championship game. That cool-calm 
`we're not done yet'' attitude. And we're not done.'' -- Falcons LB 
Cornelius Bennett. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``We really don't have a different mindset. The thing is, we  
know what to expect. We realize that we're here for business. If 
you want to go on cruises or rent Sea Doos, come back after the 
game and you can do all of that. You can rent a villa on Star 
Island or fly Sly Stallone's private jet if you want. We're here to 
win a football game.'' -- Broncos TE Shannon Sharpe, on Denver being 
favored Sunday after entering last year's game as an underdog.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Trial Videos To Be Public </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal appeals court reluctantly agreed  
Friday that an obscure 1913 law allows the public to see the entire 
videotape of Microsoft's billionaire chairman, Bill Gates, 
struggling through three days of interviews by government lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision also opens roughly 100 other depositions already  
taken in the government's high-profile antitrust case against 
Microsoft, including interviews with some of the high-tech 
industry's most powerful players, such as top executives of Intel 
Corp., IBM Corp., Apple Computer Corp. and Netscape Communications 
Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	And the ruling effectively ensures the public can attend any  
future interviews with executives related to the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court called the 86-year-old law requiring open  
antitrust depositions ``an anachronism,'' but told Microsoft it 
found no reason to avoid enforcing it. The rarely used law says 
such depositions ``shall be open to the public as freely as are 
trials in open court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We do not disagree with Microsoft's claim that the reason  
originally underlying the statute has for the most part vanished,'' 
the court said. ``Like Tithonus, to whom Zeus gave eternal life but 
not eternal youth, (the law) may well be with us longer than most 
anyone would wish.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft did not say whether it will appeal the ruling by the  
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, but the 
company said it wasn't surprised by the decision. 
</P>
<P>
	The case originally was brought by lawyers representing several  
media organizations, including The Associated Press. Steve Geimann 
of the national Society of Professional Journalists called the 
ruling ``an overwhelming victory for the public, especially in view 
of the incredible cost and interest in what the government is doing 
with Microsoft.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The court ordered its clerk's office not to release any video or  
transcripts until at least seven days after the company decides 
whether to appeal, which could take weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems clear that the appeals court was sympathetic to our  
argument that this obscure 1913 law was obsolete,'' spokesman Mark 
Murray said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even once the court decides to release videotapes, the material  
would likely be reviewed first by the judge or an appointee to 
remove references to trade secrets or other types of confidential 
information, which could delay the release weeks more. 
</P>
<P>
	Through 13 weeks of trial, the government has already showed  
roughly eight of the 20 hours of Gates battling lawyers about his 
company's business practices. The government interviewed Gates over 
three days last summer at Microsoft's headquarters near Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	The tape proved highly embarrassing -- and occasionally  
entertaining -- as Gates, the world's wealthiest man worth more than 
$82 billion, professed to forget key events and appeared to evade 
questions. 
</P>
<P>
	Gates himself bristled at the government's use of the videotape.  
</P>
<P>
	``I answered every question, completely, truthfully through  
many, many, many long days,'' Gates told The Associated Press in 
November. ``The fact that they're taking snippets out of that and 
holding them up without having me there because they chose not to 
call me as a witness, I think, is quite novel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the trial, when Microsoft complained about use of the  
video in the courtroom, the judge admonished: ``If anything, I 
think the problem is with your witness, not with the way in which 
his testimony is being presented.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's evident to every spectator that, for whatever  
reasons, in many respects Mr. Gates has not been particularly 
responsive,'' U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson told a 
Microsoft lawyer.

<HEADLINE> Oil Industry Slump Likely to Linger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Any improvement in the nation's sagging oil and  
gas industry probably won't come soon enough to prevent 1999 from 
being among the industry's worst years, according to a trade 
magazine survey released Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In World Oil magazine's annual letter to oil industry  
executives, publisher Lanie Finlayson said survey data foreshadows 
an 18 percent decrease in oil and gas drilling from 1998's anemic 
levels and continued poor rig counts. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston-based Baker Hughes Inc., which has monitored rig counts  
since 1944, reported Friday a record low 562 active U.S. rigs this 
week as weak prices continue to stifle exploration and production. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's difficult to find anything positive to say about drilling  
activity, especially in the U.S., after the devastation that 
occurred during 1998,'' said Finlayson, whose magazine is owned by 
Gulf Publishing Co., which has followed the industry since 1916. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on its survey of 20 major drillers and 235 independents,  
World Oil forecasts 21,125 wells will be drilled in the United 
States this year, down from 25,639 in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	In Texas, the magazine predicts a 23 percent cutback in drilling  
from 8,846 rigs last year to 6,797 in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	California should fare even worse, with a projected drop of 44  
percent, from about 2,400 rigs in 1998 to 1,350 this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The news is better internationally, where production costs are  
cheaper. Total drilling activity is expected to dip just 4 percent, 
though the survey bodes ill for drilling prospects in the North 
Sea, South America and several other regions. 
</P>
<P>
	Some industry watchers are skeptical of the widely reported  
oversupply that has cut oil prices in half over the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it ever existed,'' said Henry Groppe, founder of  
the Houston-based consulting firm Groppe, Long and Littell. 
</P>
<P>
	Another analyst agreed the perceived oversupply is widely  
questioned in the industry, but cautioned that recent warm winters, 
depressed Asian economies and rampant production from members of 
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries must turn around 
for prices to change. 
</P>
<P>
	``Demand coming from the emerging worlds, specifically southeast  
Asia, was probably the main contributor to incremental growth in 
the last 10 years,'' said William Herbert, chief oilfield services 
analyst for Howard, Weil, Labouisse, Friedrichs in Houston. ``That 
evaporated and hasn't come back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Russell Wright, World Oil's editorial director, said any  
improvement in the oil market is likely to be tentative and could 
come too late to save the industry from a dismal 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't expect higher prices to impact drilling levels, since  
operators will hold off on plans until they're sure it's for 
real,'' Wright told more than 600 industry representatives at a 
breakfast hosted Friday by the magazine.

<HEADLINE> Ventura: End Public Radio, TV Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- Pity the folks in Lake Wobegon -- the  
governor wants to eliminate state aid for public radio and 
television. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Jesse Ventura, whose colorful resume includes a stint as a  
radio talk show host, proposed cutting aid to Minnesota Public 
Radio, which produces Garrison Keillor's ``A Prairie Home 
Companion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	State funding for MPR would be eliminated in three years; for  
television, it would be within four years. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura, who released his first budget Thursday, said public  
radio has plenty of producers and ``state of the art equipment'' 
while the Twin Cities commercial stations he worked for -- KFAN-AM 
and KSTP-AM -- sometimes used equipment held together by tape. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura's aides did not know what current funding levels are.  
</P>
<P>
	An official at MPR said state funds -- about 2 percent of its  
budget -- have never been used to pay for the network's operating 
expenses, only for capital expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	MPR is hoping to use new state money to complete a statewide  
network that would include new stations in towns not served by 
commercial stations, said Will Haddeland, vice president for public 
affairs.

<HEADLINE> Cavs Extend Ilgauskas' Contract </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Zydrunas Ilgauskas couldn't wait until morning  
to tell his family in Lithuania that he was staying with the 
Cleveland Cavaliers, and he was rich. 
</P>
<P>
	Ilgauskas, a 7-foot-3 center who would have been a free agent  
after this season, signed a six-year contract extension with the 
Cavaliers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cavs didn't announce terms of the deal Friday, but it was  
believed to be worth $70.875 million, the maximum allowed to a 
player entering his third season under the NBA's new collective 
bargaining agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	It took only a few hours for Ilgauskas' agent, Herb Rudoy, to  
work out the deal with the Cavaliers Thursday. Ilgauskas averaged 
nearly 14 points last season, and the Cavs realized his potential 
was too much to pass up. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had the goods,'' Rudoy said. ``When you've got the goods,  
it's not hard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Once the deal was finalized Thursday night, Ilgauskas --  
nicknamed `Z' -- telephoned his family despite it being 1 a.m. in 
Lithuania. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were all sleeping,'' Ilgauskas said. ``But I talked to  
them and they were very happy. They like Cleveland a lot, they've 
been here a lot and they like it here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With a 4-to-1 exchange rate, Ilgauskas' contract would be worth  
more than $280 million litas in his homeland. But he said that's 
not why he's staying in Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not about the money,'' he said. ``I wanted to stay  
because the Cavaliers gave me a chance to prove myself as a player 
and I think we have a great future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ilgauskas was the Cavs' first-round pick in the 1996 NBA Draft,  
but sat out the '96-97 season when he broke his right foot for the 
second time in two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Many wondered if Cleveland wasn't wasting its time with an  
unproven center who appeared injury-prone and lacked the physical 
tools to play in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	But bulked up (he now weighs 260) and healthy, `Z' blossomed  
last season, averaging 13.9 points and 8.8 rebounds per game for 
the young Cavaliers. He was one of four Cavs chosen to the 
All-Rookie team and won MVP honors during the All-Star rookie game. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cavs feel that Ilgauskas' signing not only shows a  
commitment to the future, but along with All-Star forward Shawn 
Kemp, it gives coach Mike Fratello stability and the cornerstones 
for a championship contender. 
</P>
<P>
	``All you have to do is look back at the teams that have won the  
NBA championships, dating back to Chicago and Detroit,'' Fratello 
said. ``They kept their nucleus together. They had those people in 
place and they built and added around them.''

<HEADLINE> Internet Fans Rescue Western Series </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ``The Magnificent Seven'' can be found at the  
intersection of the Old West and the new frontier -- the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The CBS series, loosely based on the 1960 movie of the same  
name, is riding again in part because of viewers who lobbied the 
network on its behalf. This time it was the mouse, not the gun, 
that won the Western. 
</P>
<P>
	There's a certain irony that one of television's most  
traditional genres should be rescued by technology. Fan Patti 
Kleckner, part of the effort to save what she fondly calls 
``Mag-Seven,'' was grateful for the electronic firepower. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's impossible to judge the impact (of the campaign) on CBS'  
decision to return the show, but from the fans' point of view it 
gave us a tremendous feeling of accomplishment,'' said Kleckner, a 
systems engineer from suburban Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	``We no longer felt like a single letter to the network was  
going to go off into never-never land. It was a group effort we 
couldn't accomplish without the Internet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The Magnificent Seven'' stakes out territory familiar to  
Western buffs. Themes of loyalty, vengeance and honor anchor the 
plots, and the dialogue has the requisite terseness and only a few 
contemporary gaffes. 
</P>
<P>
	``How do you honor a man of peace? With bloodshed, or  
forgiveness? You need to find forgiveness, ma'am,'' Josiah, played 
by Ron Perlman, tells a mother bent on killing her son's murderer 
in the episode airing 9 p.m. EST tonight. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're wrong preacher,'' the woman (guest star Tyne Daly)  
replies. ``I made a promise to David. I will find forgiveness when 
I've kept my word. ... My kind of justice is the apocalypse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It also offers the kind of fairly bloody shoot-'em-ups that are  
relatively rare on violence-conscious television these days. 
</P>
<P>
	(Historical footnote: It was violence that helped drive the  
popular 1960s Western, ``The Wild West,'' from television after 
Congress held hearings on the issue, according to ``Les Brown's 
Encyclopedia of Television.'') 
</P>
<P>
	``Magnificent Seven'' gets the dusty, wind-blown look right --  
it's filmed north of Los Angeles at Gene Autry's old studio, Melody 
Ranch, and at other movie ranches clustered nearby. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides Perlman, the series features Michael Biehn, Eric Close,  
Andrew Kavovit, Dale Midkiff, Anthony Starke, Rick Worthy and 
Laurie Holden. 
</P>
<P>
	Yul Brynner and Steve McQueen starred in the 1960 film version,  
based on Akira Kurosawa's ``The Seven Samurai,'' about seven men 
hired by a small village for protection against bandits. In the TV 
adaptation, the gunfighters battle various evil people. 
</P>
<P>
	When it first debuted in January 1998, the series made a strong  
showing and ranked No. 14. After preemptions because of events 
including the Olympics, however, it had plummeted in the ratings 
and its future seemed doubtful. 
</P>
<P>
	Then an eye-catching ad appeared last May in the trade paper  
Daily Variety: ``Wanted: The Magnificent Seven. Return Winning Show 
to Viewers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The $1,000 cost was covered by at least 100 fans from across the  
nation who had linked up via the Internet, Kleckner said. They and 
many others already had flooded CBS with e-mail requests for the 
show's survival. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once we decided to do the ad, everybody jumped up and said, 'I  
can give you $5, I can give $10,''' Kleckner said. One woman 
coordinated the money collection, another used her credit card to 
secure the ad space and Kleckner and a fourth person wrote the ad. 
</P>
<P>
	Why the passion for the series?  
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a bunch of giddy teen-agers drooling over men,''  
Kleckner said then. ``The show is extremely well-written and the 
characters individually and collectively have a tremendous amount 
of chemistry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although ``Magnificent Seven'' didn't make CBS' fall schedule,  
it returned earlier this month to replace the sinking detective 
series ``Buddy Faro'' on Fridays. Thirteen new episodes are 
scheduled to run, the network said; its fate after that is 
uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
	``Magnificent Seven'' hasn't been able to beat the competition,  
including ABC's ``Sabrina the Teen-Age Witch.'' But the Western 
represents a big improvement over ``Buddy Faro'' numbers and is 
drawing more of the advertiser-favored male audience. 
</P>
<P>
	Perlman was part of another series in 1987-90, ``Beauty and the  
Beast,'' that also inspired audience devotion. He knows how deep 
loyalty can run: Every day, he said, he's approached by those who 
admired the fantasy drama that co-starred Linda Hamilton. 
</P>
<P>
	He is grateful but unsurprised by the response to ``Magnificent  
Seven.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If you do a Western that's got any kind of depth or integrity,  
that approaches the genre in a respectful and unpredictable 
fashion, there are people out there who are voraciously interested 
in spending their time watching a show like that,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kleckner received a nice thank you from CBS for helping to lead  
the save-the-''Seven'' effort: She appeared as an extra in the Jan. 
8 episode. 
</P>
<P>
	The experience also renewed her faith in broadcast television  
and confirmed the power of the Net for her. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a viewer, I felt I never could make my voice heard. I found  
this particular show brought me back to network television because 
I had drifted away to cable and the (satellite) dish. And the 
Internet let me make my thoughts known to the people who had the 
power.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere in television ....  
</P>
<P>
	MONEY, MONEY, MONEY: PBS, figuring that most of us are concerned  
with getting and keeping the green stuff, has come up with ``Right 
on the Money,'' a 26-part series that promises to help real people 
solve real money problems. Host Chris Farrell, a business 
journalist and radio commentator, will take viewers cross-country 
to meet people who will learn how to better manage their finances. 
Among the subjects covered: buying a car, credit card debt, 401Ks 
and retirement planning. The half-hour series airs on public 
television stations tonight (check local listings).

<HEADLINE> Clinton Lawyers To Coax Lewinsky </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton's lawyers once searched for  
an innocent alternative to Monica Lewinsky's sensational story. Now 
six months after their client admitted to an affair, they get their 
first chance to question the former White House intern. 
</P>
<P>
	Presidential advisers say the lawyers probably will handle the  
deposition Monday gingerly, hoping to coax her to repeat statements 
that are helpful to the president without challenging her 
credibility. 
</P>
<P>
	Along the way, they might also explore her treatment by  
prosecutors who were pressing hard for her cooperation, a subject 
that was ignored before the grand jury, according to advisers 
familiar with the White House's emerging strategy for Monday's 
videotaped deposition. 
</P>
<P>
	These advisers, inside and outside the White House, cautioned on  
Friday that final decisions would not come until later this 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	They stressed the goal was to use their side's four hours of  
questioning of Ms. Lewinsky to embolden the 44 Senate Democrats who 
have already voted to dismiss the case and who hold the ability to 
acquit Clinton at the impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	House prosecutors are expected to zero in on details of the  
relationship in an effort to show the president's efforts to find 
Ms. Lewinsky a job were inextricably connected to her filing a 
false affidavit denying their affair and that the hiding of gifts 
he had given her was part of a scheme by Clinton to obstruct 
justice. 
</P>
<P>
	In stark contrast, the White House legal team is likely to work  
the margins of Ms. Lewinsky's account, accentuating her most 
favorable past testimony. Chief among those statements was her 
assertion last August: ``No one ever asked me to lie and I was 
never promised a job for my silence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One adviser, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the goal  
would be to show that any cover stories Ms. Lewinsky and the 
president developed were aimed at hiding their relationship from 
the beginning -- ``like any two embarrassed adults'' -- and were not 
constructed later to obstruct justice. 
</P>
<P>
	The president's defenders have also discussed posing some  
questions about the threat of prosecution she and her parents were 
under as Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's office tried to compel 
her cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ms. Lewinsky was never asked by Mr. Starr's assistants in the  
grand jury about the kinds of coercive threats which were made 
against her and her family,'' said former Watergate prosecutor 
Richard Ben-Veniste, an outside adviser to the White House. ``And 
since she will be under oath, she will be obliged to answer 
questions of that nature.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ben-Veniste said Clinton's lawyers could use their questions to  
point out that when FBI agents and Starr's prosecutors confronted 
Ms. Lewinsky in a hotel on Jan. 16, 1998, and threatened her with 
perjury in the Paula Jones case, her lawyers had not yet filed with 
the court clerk the affidavit denying a sexual relationship with 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was absurd but I'm sure very real to her at the time,''  
Ben-Veniste said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two lawyers who have played a role in the president's defense at  
the trial, Deputy White House Counsel Cheryl Mills and private 
attorney Nicole Seligman, are preparing for the Lewinsky interview 
although it is unclear who will actually pose the questions for 
Clinton's side. 
</P>
<P>
	The president's supporters, mindful that Ms. Lewinsky would risk  
her protection from prosecution if she altered her account 
substantially, are taking pains to portray her in public as 
truthful and consistent. 
</P>
<P>
	It is a marked difference from a year ago when presidential  
lawyers sought out inconsistencies in her story, hoping to discover 
an innocent explanation for her 37 visits to the White House after 
she was no longer employed there. Other presidential supporters 
were dismissing her as a ``stalker.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see her as a hostile witness at all,'' said former  
presidential special counsel Lanny Davis, who continues to advise 
the White House. ``On 23 occasions, she was questioned by Ken 
Starr's staff, anxious to bulldoze her, and I admire the fact that 
she has stuck to the truth throughout.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But while both Ms. Lewinsky and Clinton now admit to an affair,  
they disagree on aspects of their relationship that are key to the 
House prosecutors' obstruction and perjury cases. 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, they differ about the timing of their sexual  
intimacy. She says it began in November 1995 when she was still an 
intern; he says it began in early 1996, after she was a full-time 
employee. 
</P>
<P>
	White House lawyers are likely to avoid that sensitive issue in  
the deposition, and instead contend in their closing arguments that 
any conflicts are just innocent differences in recall, advisers 
said.

<HEADLINE> Robinson's Ring Inspires Falcons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- The ring sits on Eugene Robinson's right hand, a  
heavyweight hunk of jewelry that catches the eye immediately, 
testimony to once playing for an NFL championship team. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson doesn't wear the ring routinely, saving it for special  
occasions. He has it on full time around the Atlanta Falcons hotel 
and training facility, providing a little extra incentive for a 
team of guys nobody wanted as they prepare for Sunday's Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	``Before the season, I wore it in training camp for two or three  
days just to show the guys,'' Robinson said. ``Jessie Tuggle said, 
`Let me see that thing. I've got to get me one of those.' Then, 
before the championship game in Minnesota, I wore it all that week, 
too. I wear it purposely. This means you put in the work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now, the ring is back in place and so is Robinson, playing in  
his third straight Super Bowl with a second team. The only other 
player with that unusual perfecta was linebacker Ken Norton with 
Dallas in 1992 and 1993 and San Francisco in 1994. Only three 
others -- running back Preston Pearson, and defensive backs Dwayne 
O'Steen and Deion Sanders -- have been to two straight Super Bowls 
with different teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson was at safety for Green Bay when the Packers earned  
their rings two years ago and again last year against Denver, when 
he picked off a pass against John Elway. 
</P>
<P>
	After the season, the Packers decided to send him packing,  
figuring that a 35-year-old asking for $1 million was a little too 
old and a little too expensive for them. 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons, operating a home for NFL castoffs, were happy to  
grab the savvy 14-year veteran, who is the league leader in 
interceptions (53) among active players. For his part, Robinson 
didn't have to be asked twice. 
</P>
<P>
	``They offered me money to play football,'' he said. ``They  
invested in my career. I love it when you say what I've said for a 
long time: The kid can play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was hard convincing some people. Robinson went undrafted when  
he came out of Colgate in 1985, signing with Seattle as a free 
agent. He stayed for 11 seasons before being traded to Green Bay 
and started his Super Bowl streak in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The playoffs seemed out of reach when he signed on with Atlanta.  
This was the Lake Woebegone of the NFL, a team that won more games 
than it lost only twice in the last 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson heard all the talk.  
</P>
<P>
	``They were giving me condolences,'' he said, ``telling me to  
have a nice smile and play golf.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, inspired by the opportunity and the challenge, Robinson  
brought veteran leadership to the Atlanta's assembly of transients. 
</P>
<P>
	``The journey is the reward,'' he said. ``For the most part, it  
reminds me of an expansion team, all new and fresh. At this 
juncture, I got caught up in the emotion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The turning point, he said, came when Atlanta went into New  
England and beat up the Patriots 41-10. 
</P>
<P>
	``They had a high-powered offense and had been to the Super Bowl  
two years ago,'' Robinson said. ``We handled those guys. We found 
out we could play. It changed the whole scheme of everything. We 
knew we had a chance in every game we played. 
</P>
<P>
	``We refuse to go away. We don't know any better.''  
</P>
<P>
	Suddenly, the Falcons led the NFL in fumble recoveries and  
defensive takeaways. Robinson had four interceptions and added a 
career-longest 77-yard pickoff in the playoffs. There were a pair 
of 10-tackle games and he returned an interception 25 yards against 
New Orleans for the first touchdown of his career. 
</P>
<P>
	It all added up to a Pro Bowl season, the third time in his  
career he's been selected for that game. For that he gets a watch. 
It would go nicely with another one of those fancy rings.

<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Tom Hanks will have one of the hottest seats  
in town to watch the Lakers, Clippers and Kings when their new 
stadium opens. 
</P>
<P>
	The star has leased a 12-seat luxury suite at Staples Center for

<HEADLINE> Turf Recovers in Time for Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- When George Toma first laid eyes on the Super Bowl  
playing field, it wasn't a pretty sight. 
</P>
<P>
	There were brown patches. Lots of brown patches, actually.  
</P>
<P>
	``You don't want brown and green streaks on national  
television,'' said Toma, who has cultivated the turf for all 33 
Super Bowls. ``We had a quilted field coming in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Three weeks and a fair amount of chemical nurturing later, the  
quilting effect is gone. The turf had a nice, lush color on Friday 
-- perfect for the NFL's signature event. 
</P>
<P>
	``What you'll see wasn't there around January 8th or 9th,'' Toma  
said. ``It will be beautiful for game time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Grown on golfer Greg Norman's sod farm in Avon, Fla., the turf  
was found to have dollar spot disease when it arrived at Pro Player 
Stadium three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The unsightly patches prompted Toma to call the field the  
``second worst'' he's ever worked on, behind only the Rose Bowl for 
the 1984 Olympic soccer tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Not exactly words Norman wanted to hear.  
</P>
<P>
	Since then, Toma and 16 other grounds crew members worked  
virtually around the clock to improve the look. Among his tools: 
some 250 gallons of green dye, 40 pounds of rye grass seed and 
countless jugs of liquid manure. 
</P>
<P>
	``In no way were we ripping the condition of the sod,'' Toma  
said. ``It's the toughest sod I've seen in my 57 years on the job. 
I just want it to be green.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Toma said he told Norman about the patches when the golfer  
inspected the field on Tuesday. Norman promised to look into the 
situation, and there were no hard feelings, Toma said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel bad. But nobody feels as bad about it as Greg Norman,''  
he said. ``He has pride and I have pride. It's just something that 
happened. Physically, it'll play good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 69-year-old Toma is retired from the groundskeeping jobs he  
held at Arrowhead Stadium and Kauffman Stadium, homes of the Kansas 
City Chiefs and baseball's Royals. He's at the Super Bowl as a 
consultant, with son Chip supervising operations. 
</P>
<P>
	``On Sunday, the field's going to be great. When they see it,  
everybody's going to be amazed,'' Chip Toma said. 
</P>
<P>
	Landing the Super Bowl contract was considered a coup for the  
Greg Norman Turf Farm, which developed the strain that goes by the 
trade name GN-1. Developed by Joe Motz, it combines burlap and 
artificial-turf fibers to create a sturdy base for the grass, a mix 
of PHD rye and lesco.

<HEADLINE> Hawaii Motorists Seek Cheap Gas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONOLULU (AP) -- Protesting Hawaii's highest-in-the-nation  
gasoline prices, two downtown gas stations rolled back prices to 
levels unseen in the state since the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	Traffic snarled along Queen Street on Friday as motorists waited  
up to an hour to fill up at a Chevron station that offered regular 
unleaded gas at 83 cents per gallon. 
</P>
<P>
	A nearby Lex Brodie station followed suit by cutting its price  
on unleaded to 79 cents a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
	Gas prices that average about $1.50 per gallon on Oahu and more  
on the Neighbor Islands are the target of a federal lawsuit by the 
state seeking hundreds of millions of dollars in damages from 
divisions of the BHP, Chevron, Shell, Tesoro, Texaco and Unocal oil 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Hawaii officials allege gasoline wholesalers are conspiring to  
maintain inflated prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale at the Chevron station was organized by a local radio  
station. Financial sponsors were expected to help lessen the 
financial blow of rolling back prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Police arrived about a half-hour after the sale started and  
wrote tickets to drivers whose cars blocked busy rush-hour 
intersections. 
</P>
<P>
	Many drivers said they didn't mind the wait.  
</P>
<P>
	``I can't even remember when it was that cheap,'' Jarrett Iman  
said.

<HEADLINE> Hawks Get Free-Agent LaPhonso Ellis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The Atlanta Hawks agreed to terms on a contract  
with free-agent forward LaPhonso Ellis on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The contract will be signed on Saturday, Hawks spokesman Arthur  
Triche said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ellis called Jazz owner Larry Miller during the first quarter of  
Utah's exhibition win over Denver to personally tell Miller he had 
decided to sign with Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	``This doesn't change our plans for the season,'' Jazz general  
manager Scott Layden said. ``It would have been nice to have him 
here, but we'll move on, and we wish him the best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ellis has spent the past six seasons with Denver after the  
Nuggets drafted him with the fifth pick of the 1992 NBA draft. The 
former Notre Dame star was named to the All-Rookie first team in 
his first season. 
</P>
<P>
	Last season, the 6-foot-8 Ellis averaged 14.3 points and 7.2  
rebounds per game. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest free agent forward pursued by the Hawks, who lost out  
on bids for Rick Fox and Billy Owens, Ellis was escorted around the 
Atlanta practice facility in suburban Marietta on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Lenny Wilkens has had two starting forwards -- Alan  
Henderson and Tyrone Corbin -- re-sign since the lockout ended. 
Corbin agreed to a one-year deal Tuesday worth $2.8 million, four 
days after Henderson signed a seven-year contract worth $45 
million.

<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- For more than 40 years, the Tobacco Institute  
was the industry's voice in the nation's capital. 
</P>
<P>
	But the institute plans to closes its doors today, a result of  
the settlement between states and cigarette makers reached last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of all the things that have been in Washington, what could be  
a more pronounced symbol of change than closing the Tobacco 
Institute?'' Scott Williams, an industry spokesman told The 
Washington Post. 
</P>
<P>
	Disbanding the institute had ``been on the list of things the  
industry can do in a tangible way to illustrate it is changing,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ending tobacco-related trade associations, such as the institute  
and the Council for Tobacco Research in New York, was among the 
conditions of the $206 billion deal between 46 states and the 
tobacco industry in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Announces Teachers' Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Michael Jordan scored big in a middle school  
gymnasium Friday, two weeks after he retired from the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	Flanked by Education Secretary W. Richard Riley, District of  
Columbia Mayor Anthony Williams and scores of adoring students and 
teachers, Jordan announced a $5 million grant program to aid 
teachers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted to focus on giving kids an opportunity to excel and  
to achieve their dreams,'' Jordan said of the ``Jordan 
Fundamentals'' program, which he launched at John Philip Sousa 
Middle School. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the plan, $1 million in proceeds from the Nike sporting  
goods Jordan brand will be spent to fund creative projects by 
teachers in poor communities. Teachers could get $2,500 each in 
grants. 
</P>
<P>
	Jason Kamros, a sixth grade math teacher at Sousa, said he'll  
apply. He estimates he has spent more than $1,000 of his own money 
this year using photography to teach math concepts. 
</P>
<P>
	Kamros said Jordan's involvement in education has more than  
monetary value. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's showing them that not only is it cool to study but it's  
critical. He's telling them that being an honors student is the way 
to be,'' Kamros said. 
</P>
<P>
	Riley agreed. Jordan, who graduated from North Carolina by  
attending summer school while playing in the NBA, is sending the 
message that ``the opportunities of the game are fleeting but an 
education lasts a lifetime,'' the education secretary said. 
</P>
<P>
	Following the announcement, Jordan turned cheerleader,  
delivering a pep talk to students in the school auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
	He said being a good student will help them fulfill all of their  
goals. ``There are a lot of great athletes who never made it 
because they couldn't get into schools,'' Jordan warned the sixth-, 
seventh- and eighth-graders. 
</P>
<P>
	The students responded much like fans in Chicago, where Jordan  
dazzled for 13 years with the Bulls. Students pumped their hands in 
the air and shouted out Jordan's name during various parts of the 
question-and-answer session. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a modern day hero,'' noted D.C. Schools Superintendent  
Arlene Ackerman. 
</P>
<P>
	The only response that drew a negative reaction was when Jordan  
reiterated that he would not return to the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a perfect time for me to walk away from the game,''  
Jordan said, adding that he has other things he wants to do, 
including coaching ``somewhere down the line.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For now, he said he is going to strive to be the best possible  
role model to young people. ``It's a heavy responsibility, but it 
was bestowed upon me,'' Jordan said. 
</P>
<P>
	And he's getting high marks there.  
</P>
<P>
	Sixth-grader Anthony Jenkins says he will try to follow in  
Jordan's footsteps or those of another black hero. ``I want to go 
to North Carolina like Michael Jordan or go to Morehouse College 
like Dr. King did,'' Jenkins said.

<HEADLINE> Teen Found Guilty in Lynching </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEARFIELD, Pa. (AP) -- After deliberating for less than three  
hours, a jury found a 16-year-old girl guilty of killing a 
learning-disabled teen-ager so she wouldn't tattle about a plan to 
run away to Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury found Jessica Holtmeyer guilty of murder, aggravated  
assault, and conspiracy in the killing of Kimberly Dotts, 15. 
</P>
<P>
	``We got what we wanted: justice for Kimmy,'' the victim's  
grandmother, Judy Fuleno, said outside court Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Holtmeyer could get life in prison. Prosecutors dropped  
their plans to seek the death penalty at the request of Kimberly's 
family. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't feel she should get the death penalty,'' said Jodi  
Dotts, Kimberly's mother. ``When you're on death row, you're there 
so long with nothing to bother you. In jail, she'll be with the 
murderers and rapists. 
</P>
<P>
	``We thought the death penalty would be too easy for her.''  
</P>
<P>
	Kimberly was hoping to make friends when she was invited to  
sleep over at another teen-ager's house last May. But she found 
herself in the woods with a group of kids she barely knew who were 
planning to run away to Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	Someone complained that Kimberly might snitch on them. A noose  
was pulled over her head, the other end slung over a maple branch, 
and Ms. Holtmeyer and 18-year-old Aaron Straw yanked on the rope 
with all their strength, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, witnesses said, after Kimberly's body dropped to the  
ground, Ms. Holtmeyer smashed the girl's face with a 
basketball-sized rock. 
</P>
<P>
	Dawn Lanager, 15, told the jury that Ms. Holtmeyer laughed after  
the hanging and later said she wanted to ``cut Kim up, scatter her 
all over the woods and keep one of her fingers as a souvenir.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Straw also testified against Ms. Holtmeyer, after District  
Attorney Paul Cherry said he would consider not asking for the 
death penalty against him. Ms. Lanager and two other teens who 
testified had murder charges against them dropped, and their cases 
were handled in the juvenile system. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Holtmeyer's attorney, Bryan S. Walk, said the teens were  
liars who traded outlandish stories for lesser charges.

<HEADLINE> Designers Plan Okla. City Memorial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- Design plans for an Oklahoma City bombing  
memorial center include a multimedia area that goes dark amid 
sounds of panic before growing quiet as 168 victims' faces flash 
rapidly around the room. 
</P>
<P>
	The experience is just one of the events planned by a design  
team selected for the Oklahoma City National Memorial Center. The 
center is a part of the Oklahoma City National Memorial for victims 
of the April 19, 1995, bombing of a federal building that killed 
168. 
</P>
<P>
	Work already is under way on the outside portion of the memorial  
on the site where the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building once stood. 
</P>
<P>
	The team of Douglas/Gallagher, Hillmann &AMP; Carr and C.H. Guernsey  
&AMP; Co. was named Thursday to design the 24,000-square-foot center to 
be housed in a portion of the Journal Record Building, heavily 
damaged by the bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	``This team will put together the chapters that tell a complete  
storyline of what happened April 19, 1995,'' said Bob Johnson, 
chairman of the Oklahoma City National Memorial Foundation trust. 
</P>
<P>
	Visitors will have access to interactive stations where they can  
view news coverage and listen to stories from people who survived 
and those who responded to the emergency. Projection monitors will 
show a variety of funeral services, and a memorial registry will 
allow visitors to leave a message for the people of Oklahoma City. 
</P>
<P>
	``The way they're going to be able to guide the visitors through  
the event step by step is amazing,'' said Bud Welch, whose daughter 
died in the bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think when the visitor exits, they will have felt like they  
went on a journey much like that experienced during the bombing,'' 
Welch said.

<HEADLINE> Court TV Apologizes for Promotion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Court TV apologized Friday for running a  
commercial depicting a disgruntled wife reaching for a steak knife 
to get revenge on a Super Bowl-obsessed husband. 
</P>
<P>
	Court TV scheduled a series of specials against the Super Bowl  
Sunday night in the hope of attracting women viewers uninterested 
in the game. All are stories about women who attacked their 
husbands, starting with the trial of Lorena Bobbitt, who was 
accused of cutting off her husband's penis. 
</P>
<P>
	The cable network abandoned its ``Wives with Knives'' promotion  
in response to complaints that it was in questionable taste. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a mistake,'' spokeswoman Frederika Brookfield said.  
</P>
<P>
	The ad promoting the programs depicts a woman making a sandwich  
in a kitchen when she hears the voice of a whining man from the 
other room. 
</P>
<P>
	She pulls a steak knife from a drawer while a woman narrator  
says: ``Don't get angry, ladies, get even. Watch `Wives with Knives 
... Five riveting hours, five emotional stories of real women who 
went after their husbands.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Court TV received a handful of angry e-mails from viewers in  
response, said Dan Levinson, executive vice president of marketing. 
</P>
<P>
	Court TV has recorded another, tamer, commercial, Brookfield  
said. It hasn't changed its schedule for Sunday night, but isn't 
promoting it as ``Wives with Knives'' anymore. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were trying to be a little humorous and irreverent,''  
Levinson said. ``We apologize.''

<HEADLINE> NY Times Magazine Interviews Murray </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bill Murray gets a little giddy thinking about  
the overwhelming response from critics for his supporting role in 
``Rushmore,'' which opens nationally next week. 
</P>
<P>
	``This stuff feels funny,'' Murray says in this weekend's  
editions of The New York Times Magazine. ``I keep thinking. Why 
now? I do a part in this small movie. I get no money. And now? It 
is almost like and injection of oxygen to the brain. It makes you 
lightheaded.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At 48, Murray says he doesn't regret passing up parts in films  
he knew would be big hits, like the 1980 spoof ``Airplane.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I've provided whole careers for other people by rejecting  
movies,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	Murray, an alumnus of NBC's ``Saturday Night Live'' who went on  
to star in the hit movies ``Ghostbusters'' and ``Groundhog Day,'' 
says his taste in comedians runs to the classics: Bob Hope, Jack 
Benny and George Burns. 
</P>
<P>
	He admires David Letterman and Conan O'Brien, but fellow ``SNL''  
alum Adam Sandler (``The Waterboy'') doesn't make him laugh. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would enjoy driving in L.A. with the windows open more than  
I would enjoy watching `The Waterboy,''' says Murray.

<HEADLINE> Gore, Davis Cementing Relationship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ABOARD AIR FORCE TWO (AP) -- High over Northern California, Vice  
President Al Gore and Gov. Gray Davis nibbled at lunch and talked 
about government, about ways to free up federal money for schools 
and farmers hurt by the orange crop freeze. 
</P>
<P>
	But there was more on the line than bureaucratic chitchat when  
Gore picked up Davis this week at San Francisco International 
Airport and flew him to Sacramento, where they would later stand 
together before news cameras. 
</P>
<P>
	The two are cementing a relationship that is likely to play a  
key role in the presidential election next year. 
</P>
<P>
	As Gore seeks the presidency, Davis is emerging as his most  
powerful ally in a state that packs more electoral votes than any 
other. Gore has in Davis a ``go-to guy'' more formidable than any 
Republican presidential candidate could hope for. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis, meanwhile, is building an image as a governor whose clout  
extends all the way to the White House. Gore, after all, helped 
deliver California's high-tech vote for Davis in last year's 
gubernatorial election. 
</P>
<P>
	Their public relations machines have meshed flawlessly to  
advance their interests together. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore stood next to Davis as he was sworn in Jan. 3, and whisked  
the new governor to the Capitol in his limousine for his first day 
on the job. The pair met privately in Davis' office, then stood 
together inside the building to greet well-wishers as news cameras 
snapped away. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Labor Department granted $1.7 million to farm workers  
hurt by the crop freeze Jan. 12, it was Gore who announced the 
award and Davis' Washington, D.C. office that alerted reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten days later, when Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman declared  
the farm counties disaster areas, Glickman was invisible. Instead, 
Gore and Davis had a telephone conversation and journalists were 
invited to listen in. 
</P>
<P>
	This week, in his 14th visit to California in a year, Gore  
crisscrossed the state announcing federal money to upgrade the 
satellite-based Global Positioning System, beef up computer 
research efforts and improve children's reading skills. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis and Gore have known each other for about 20 years, and the  
two are startlingly similar in both background, outlook and 
demeanor. 
</P>
<P>
	Both went to war in Vietnam. Both marched steadily through the  
ranks of government, carving niches as moderate ``New Democrats'' 
who refuse to be outflanked by Republicans on GOP issues like crime 
and taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Both are cautious and halting in their speaking styles. Davis  
likes to josh that he has pressed the wooden Gore into service as 
his ``charisma adviser.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that charisma advice has paid off. I see some real  
sparks there,'' Gore said with a smile on Monday.

<HEADLINE> Baseline Craftsmen Work Men's Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) -- For those who complain that power is  
killing men's tennis, with aces flying wild at Wimbledon and the 
U.S. Open, that will most certainly not be the case in the 
Australian Open final. 
</P>
<P>
	No matter who wins Sunday's match between Russia's Yevgeny  
Kafelnikov and Sweden's Thomas Enqvist, the rallies will be long 
and the points constructed by baseline craftsmen. 
</P>
<P>
	``The one thing I promise you,'' Kafelnikov said, ``it's going  
to be a long match.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All their matches the past five years have been close, with  
Enqvist holding a 4-2 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Kafelnikov and Enqvist are hardly wimps on the court, slapping  
moonballs back and forth. They're line-drive hitters, looking for 
the corners and sharp angles, working their way toward the net 
carefully and cautiously. 
</P>
<P>
	They'll each have their share of aces -- in three-set semis,  
Kafelnikov had 16 against Tommy Haas, Enqvist 10 against Nicolas 
Lapentti -- but the dominant shot will be the groundstroke. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll try to work as hard as I can on court,'' Kafelnikov said.  
``I definitely will not try to play for the shortest point 
possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nor will Enqvist, who is seeking to be the first unseeded winner  
at the Australian since Mark Edmondson in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
	They are grinders, Kafelnikov and Enqvist, trying to wear each  
other down. 
</P>
<P>
	That's how Kafelnikov won the 1996 French Open, and that's how  
he hopes to win this one on the relatively slow, rubberized hard 
court. 
</P>
<P>
	Before Kafelnikov and Enqvist slug it out from the baseline, the  
women settle their final Saturday, with two-time defending champion 
Martina Hingis facing French sensation Amelie Mauresmo. Hingis is 
going for her third straight Australian Open title. 
</P>
<P>
	Mauresmo, a 19-year-old with brawny shoulders and booming shots,  
won the junior Wimbledon and French titles in 1996 but never had 
gone beyond the third round of a major. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought I was playing a guy,'' said Lindsay Davenport, who  
was beaten in a three-set semifinal by Mauresmo. ``The girl was 
hitting it so hard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Enqvist has won 14 straight matches, including titles in a  
tuneup tournament and an exhibition. But Kafelnikov hopes the 
pressure of a Grand Slam final might work against the Swede. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know how he's going to handle the pressure in a slam  
final,'' Kafelnikov said. ``But all I can say is I definitely feel 
like the underdog because he's playing a lot better right now than 
me. He's in great form at the moment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yet, Kafelnikov also knows that Enqvist is capable of  
capitulating at odd moments. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know I will get my chances,'' Kafelnikov said. ``Thomas is  
known, I wouldn't say for choking, but ...'' 
</P>
<P>
	He mentioned the way Enqvist ``played loose'' when he was  
serving for the match at 5-4 against Mark Philippoussis in the 
fourth round, then got pushed to five sets. 
</P>
<P>
	``I mean, you don't need to do such things,'' Kafelnikov said.  
``All you have to do is just concentrate for one game, just serve 
out the match and it's over. I know if I'll stay in the match with 
him, I will get my chances.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Someone suggested to Kafelnikov that he played just as loose  
serving for the match at 5-3 in the fifth set against Andrei Pavel 
in the fourth round. Pavel broke, but Kafelnikov broke back to win 
at 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
	``So do you choke?'' Kafelnikov was asked.  
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes,'' Kafelnikov had to admit, ``yes.''

<HEADLINE> NFL Boss Backs LT for Hall of Fame </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Lawrence Taylor's candidacy for the Pro Football  
Hall of Fame got a boost from Commissioner Paul Tagliabue on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Hall is about performance on the field,'' he said.  
``Lawrence was one of the greatest players ever. I think the public 
understands that by making a judgment on what he did on the field, 
you're not judging what he did off it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an hour-long Super Bowl news conference, Tagliabue addressed  
a wide range of issues including instant replay, which he once 
again said should be back next season. 
</P>
<P>
	On Taylor, however, his commitment was firm. The 10-time Pro  
Bowl linebacker for the New York Giants would be an automatic pick 
in his first year of eligibility if not for a series of 
drug-related arrests and one suspension during his career. 
</P>
<P>
	Tagliabue noted that league officials and the Giants, headed by  
owner Wellington Mara, have been trying to help Taylor overcome his 
substance abuse problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully, getting into the Hall will be a way for him to  
regain some self-esteem,'' Tagliabue said. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor must get 29 of the 36 votes from media members on  
Saturday to ensure his election. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of Tagliabue's address dealt with officiating and he took  
the offensive, saying he thought much of the criticism of officials 
this season was overblown. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we succeeded in shooting ourselves in the foot by  
jumping on the officials with our network partners in ways that 
were unfair,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But he added:  
</P>
<P>
	``We will look at all aspects of officiating. We are not going  
to look at it with rose-colored glasses, but I don't think we need 
to view the issues any differently than we have in the past.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tagliabue also said:  
</P>
<P>
	-- The NFL was making progress in hiring minority coaches even  
though just one of the 25 head coaching vacancies in the past three 
years has been filled by a black coach. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were one game away from a Super Bowl with a black coach, a  
black quarterback and black personnel executives,'' Tagliabue said, 
referring to the Minnesota Vikings, who lost to Atlanta in the NFC 
championship game. ``We think we've made a lot of progress getting 
minorities in the loop.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-- San Francisco owner Edward DeBartolo Jr., who has pleaded  
guilty to failing to report a felony and fined $2 million, will not 
be reinstated for the 1999 season. Instead, Tagliabue said, 
DeBartolo's sister, Denise DeBartolo York, has agreed to continue 
to run the team. 
</P>
<P>
	But he acknowledged that DeBartolo probably had a say in the  
recent decision to bring back Bill Walsh as general manager. ``I 
may be a lot of things, but I'm not naive or dumb,'' Tagliabue 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	As for replay, Tagliabue said he was almost certain it would be  
approved in some form at the league's March meetings. 
</P>
<P>
	He said league officials were studying devices with digital  
replay capability that could be used to make quick decisions. But 
he said there will still be debates about whether to use a coaches' 
challenge system or return to a system used from 1986-91, when a 
replay official in a booth would spot calls to be reviewed. 
</P>
<P>
	One reason replay has failed to pass during the last few  
meetings was the lack of consensus among coaches on a system. Many 
disliked the challenge system because it would require a quick 
decision that would cost them a time out if they were wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	But Tagliabue said some coaches were coming around on the  
challenge system and he hoped a consensus could be reached when the 
competition committee meets before the owners convene. 
</P>
<P>
	``Coaches make quick decisions all the time,'' he said. ``That's  
one of the things that makes a good coach.''

<HEADLINE>  Dollar Higher, Japanese Stocks Rise / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Strong U.S. economic data helped the dollar  
maintain some of its overnight strength against the yen today in 
Tokyo, but profit-taking cut into its gains. Japanese stocks rose. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 115.98 yen in midafternoon trading, up 0.52  
yen from late Thursday in Tokyo but below its late New York level 
of 116.40 yen overnight. It ranged between 115.95 yen and 116.45 
yen in trading today. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 156.93 points,  
or 1.09 percent, to finish the day at 14,499.25 points. On 
Thursday, the average closed down 107.74 points, or 0.75 percent. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Gore, Primakov Tackle Economy, Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAVOS, Switzerland (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore urged the  
Russian prime minister on Friday to address questions the IMF has 
about the viability of the Russian budget, a senior U.S. official 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov told Gore that his  
country's economy was now relatively stable, but foreign lenders 
were skeptical. The International Monetary Fund has criticized the 
budget as unfeasible and has balked at approving new loans. 
</P>
<P>
	``The budget makes some assumptions that need to be really  
discussed,'' the U.S. official said, speaking on condition of 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The lower house of Russia's parliament started its third reading  
of the proposed 1999 budget Friday, and was expected to pass the 
document. The vote was ``a major political achievement,'' the U.S. 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore and Primakov also met privately to discuss arms technology  
transfers. The United States has imposed sanctions on three Russian 
scientific institutions which, it says, helped Iran develop 
weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States says the question of Russia's ability to  
control the flow of rocket technology to Iran could hurt future 
collaboration in space. Russia, which denies the accusation and has 
criticized the U.S. sanctions, also warned that the sanctions could 
damage relations. 
</P>
<P>
	Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi, who is also in Davos,  
denied Iran is working on a nuclear missile or seeking foreign help 
to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore and Primakov will meet again in Washington from March 23-24  
to further discuss technical and economic cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
	In a speech earlier Friday, Gore proposed sweeping cuts in farm  
trade barriers and urged Japan to do more to help the world 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore added that President Clinton's 2000 budget, to be sent to  
Congress next week, will propose ``significant new funding'' for 
relieving the debt of highly indebted poor nations.

	Economy Grows at 5.6 Percent Rate  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. economy grew at a breakneck 5.6  
percent annual rate during the final three months of 1998, ending a 
year that saw U.S. prosperity undiminished in an economically 
troubled world. For all of 1998, the nation's gross domestic 
product -- the total of goods and services produced within U.S. 
borders -- increased by 3.9 percent, the Commerce Department said. 
That followed an identical increase in 1997 and a healthy 3.4 
percent rise in 1996, making the three-year period the economy's 
most robust run of growth since 1984-86. 

</P>
<P>
	Gore Urges Trade Barrier Cuts  
</P>
<P>
	DAVOS, Switzerland (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore today proposed  
``broad and deep'' cuts in barriers to international farm trade and 
urged Japan to do more to help the world economy. The United States 
will also do its part, he said, speaking at the World Economic 
Forum. President Clinton's 2000 budget, which will be sent to 
Congress next week, will propose ``significant new funding'' for 
relieving the debt of poor nations, he said. But he said other 
countries would have to contribute to stimulating the world's 
economy and said the United States cannot be the only country to 
boost imports in economically turbulent times.

would be able to choose from music produced by Sony, and would be

Average rose 156.93 points, or 1.09 percent, to finish the day at 
14,499.25 points. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index, the Hong Kong

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock indexes climbed yesterday and the Nasdaq  
composite index set a new high, as strong earnings, stock splits 
and another high-profile Internet merger pulled technology shares 
out of the previous day's funk. The Dow Jones industrial average 
climbed 81.10 to 9,281.33. The Nasdaq composite surged 70.20 to 
2,477.34, beating the previous record of 2,433.41 set Tuesday. The 
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 composite added 22.20 to 1,265.37.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Internet stocks led the charge yesterday, as  
Internet search service Yahoo! announced it is buying GeoCities 
Inc. for $5.02 billion in stock. Yahoo! shares soared 31 7/8 to 367 3/4, 
and GeoCities shares shot up 42 1/4 to 117 1/4, both in Nasdaq trading. 
America Online, another Internet stock, rose 8 15/16 to 174 7/16 in 
leading volume on the Big Board. The online service provider beat 
analysts' earnings estimates and announced a two-for-one stock 
split after the close of trading Wednesday. Intel rose 4 7/16 to 
137 3/16 in leading Nasdaq volume, after the software company 
announced its own two-for-one split yesterday.

	Drugs, Cars, Banks Turn Higher  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Eli Lilly shares rose 1 1/2 to 92 1/4 yesterday after  
it announced strong earnings and authorized a $1 billion 
stock-repurchase program. And competitor Pfizer, capitalizing on 
the current craze for stock splits, advanced 5 5/8 to 127 9/16 after 
the company said its board would vote on a three-for-one stock 
split in April. Ford's shares rose 2 3/16 to 62 1/2 and Volvo's 
American depositary receipts declined 13/16 to 26 11/16 after Ford 
announced it was buying the passenger car division of Volvo. The 
market was also helped higher by a recovery in bank stocks. Hit 
hard Wednesday by trouble in Brazil, they recovered Thursday as the 
Brazilian real and stock market stabilized. Citigroup rose 1 11/16 
to 55 1/2, and J.P. Morgan added 4 5/16 to 104 3/8. Both are Dow 
components. 

</P>
<P>
	Intel Splits Stock 2-for-1  
</P>
<P>
	SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- In a move widely anticipated by  
financial analysts, Intel Corp. has announced a 2-for-1 stock split 
that will make shares more affordable to investors. Intel, the 
world's largest computer chipmaker with $26.2 billion in sales last 
year, said yesterday that the split takes effect April 11. The 
split would be the 12th since Intel went public in 1971. The last 
split, also 2-for-1, was in June 1997. The company has 1.67 billion 
shares of stock outstanding. An investor who purchased $100 worth 
of Intel stock when it first went public in Oct. 1971 would now be 
holding shares worth $397,597.

<HEADLINE> Maryland Wants Tyson Imprisoned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Maryland prosecutor recommended Friday that  
former heavyweight boxing champion Mike Tyson serve jail time on 
charges of second-degree assault in connection with an August 
traffic accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson is ``nothing less than a timebomb buried in our own  
backyard,'' said Montgomery County, Md. State's Attorney Doug 
Gansler in a memorandum sent to District Court Judge Stephen 
Johnson. Gansler outlined a history of violent outbursts by Tyson 
in and out of the ring, adding that Tyson has not taken 
responsibility for his actions. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson's attorney, Paul Kemp, could not immediately be reached  
for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The former heavyweight champion has pleaded no contest to the  
two assault charges. The plea is not an admission of guilt. Tyson 
allegedly punched one driver and kicked another in the groin after 
a car driven by his wife, Monica, was rear-ended in a three-car 
collision in Gaithersburg, Md. Tyson was headed to his home in 
nearby Bethesda when the accident occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	Gansler did not specify how much jail time he thinks Tyson  
deserves. 
</P>
<P>
	``Given the defendant's denial of responsibility, his defiance,  
his comments on his character, and his predictions of future 
conduct, the goals of deterrence and rehabilitation may never be 
achieved,'' Gansler said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sentencing is set for Feb. 5.  
</P>
<P>
	Tyson, 32, is on probation from a 1992 rape conviction in  
Indiana. Authorities there have said they will wait for the 
conclusion of this case to decide whether he has violated that 
probation, scheduled to end in March. 
</P>
<P>
	The accident was minor, noted Gansler, calling Tyson's behavior  
``the flagrant and unjustified action of a bully.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This explosion of road rage ... is difficult, if not  
impossible, adequately to explain or comprehend under the 
circumstances,'' Gansler said, noting Tyson's outburst was not an 
isolated incident. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecutor cited the title bout in which Tyson bit Evander  
Holyfield's ear in June 1997. Tyson's license was suspended. It was 
restored in October by the Nevada Athletic Commission. He also 
outlined Tyson's lengthy juvenile criminal record.

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- For more than 40 years, the Tobacco Institute  
was the industry's voice in the nation's capital. 
</P>
<P>
	But the institute plans to closes its doors today, a result of  
the settlement between states and cigarette makers reached last 
year. 
</P>

	``Of all the things that have been in Washington, what could be  
a more pronounced symbol of change than closing the Tobacco 
Institute?'' Scott Williams, an industry spokesman told The 
Washington Post. 
</P>
<P>
	Disbanding the institute had ``been on the list of things the  
industry can do in a tangible way to illustrate it is changing,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ending tobacco-related trade associations, such as the institute  
and the Council for Tobacco Research in New York, was among the

<HEADLINE> Economy Grows at 5.6 Percent Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's economy ended 1998 with the  
strongest growth in 2 1/2 years, turning in a stellar performance for 
the third consecutive year. Consumers' appetite for houses and cars 
and businesses' hunger for computers shielded the United States 
from the slump that swept the globe. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are the best economic times in living memory,'' said  
Commerce Department Under Secretary Robert J. Shapiro. ``In 
December, we broke the record for the longest peacetime expansion 
in American history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The gross domestic product -- the total of goods and services  
produced within U.S. borders -- increased at a seasonally and 
inflation-adjusted annual rate of 5.6 percent in the 
October-December quarter, the best since the spring of 1996, the 
department said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	For all of 1998, the GDP increased a robust 3.9 percent. That  
followed an identical gain in 1997 and a brisk 3.4 percent advance 
in 1996, making the three-year period the economy's fastest run 
since 1984-86. 
</P>
<P>
	But, in a sense, the past three years were even better because  
inflation was negligible. A price index tied to the GDP rose 1 
percent last year. There hasn't been a rate that low since 1959 -- 1 
percent -- and it hasn't been lower since 1950 -- 0.9 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Essentially, lower energy costs acted like a tax cut for  
consumers and businesses, and also lowered inflation,'' said 
economist Allen Sinai of Primark Decision Economics in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	The extent of the strength in the fourth quarter surprised  
analysts, but then they've been surprised for much of the past two 
years. Now they predict the economy will slow later this year, 
reflecting the impact of the world slump on U.S. manufacturing, 
agriculture and energy production. 
</P>
<P>
	In a new forecast Friday, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget  
Office predicted a moderate 2.3 percent growth in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, the U.S. trade deficit worsened, with imports shooting  
10.8 percent higher and exports growing only 1.5 percent, the 
weakest in 15 years. But business investment in new equipment 
jumped 16.7 percent, the most in six years, driven by a 62 percent 
increase in computer sales. 
</P>
<P>
	And consumer spending -- two-thirds of economic activity -- rose  
4.8 percent, the most in 14 years. Housing construction surged 10.4 
percent, the most since 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	To maintain the pace, consumers reduced their savings rate --  
savings as a percentage of after-tax income -- from 2.1 percent in 
1997 to 0.5 percent in 1998, the lowest since 1933. 
</P>
<P>
	They borrowed, dipped into their stock-market wealth accumulated  
during the long bull market of the 1990s and tapped their home 
equity in a wave of refinancing triggered by the lowest mortgage 
rates in three decades. 
</P>
<P>
	With the savings rate so low, consumers will have difficulty  
maintaining their spending through 1999 and, with profits under 
pressure from developments overseas, businesses probably won't be 
able to spend as briskly on new equipment, many economists believe. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would emphasize the risks,'' said economist William A. Brown  
of J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co. ``At the moment, it's really the U.S. consumer 
that's the one point of strength in the global economy, and that 
spending is very dependent on high stock prices and easy credit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, the late-1998 surge in GDP positioned the economy  
to begin this year robustly. Cheered by the upbeat report, the Dow 
Jones average of industrial stocks rose 77.5 points to 9,359 on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Fourth-quarter GDP was heavily influenced by a jump in  
automobile output, at an 80.7 percent annual rate, reflecting the 
return to production at General Motors after strikes over the 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Exports, after declining for three consecutive quarters for the  
first time in 40 years, rebounded. 
</P>
<P>
	The combination of strong growth, very low inflation -- but  
looming threats from overseas -- means the Federal Reserve, after 
cutting short-term interest rates three times in the fall, probably 
won't touch rates again for some months.

<HEADLINE> Nine West Cuts Office Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Nine West Group will cut 144 jobs in its  
corporate offices, the latest attempt by the struggling women's 
shoe maker to reduce costs and improve its profitability. 
</P>
<P>
	The layoffs announced Thursday come just two months after Nine  
West said it would slash 700 jobs, close two factories and reduce 
the number of shoes it makes annually. 
</P>
<P>
	Including the latest cuts, White Plains, N.Y.-based Nine West  
has eliminated about 6 percent of its total workforce of 13,000 
since November. 
</P>
<P>
	The company will take a charge of $3.2 million in the fourth  
quarter of fiscal 1998 to cover the costs related to the downsizing 
in its corporate offices. 
</P>
<P>
	It's been a tough year for Nine West, which estimates it sells  
about 20 percent of all the women's shoes sold in the United 
States. Its brands include Nine West, Easy Spirit, Enzo Angiolini, 
Bandolino, Calvin Klein, Westies and Pappagallo. It fits into a 
niche between designer shoes and discount shoes with prices 
generally between $50 and $90. 
</P>
<P>
	Women's footwear overall sales have been weak, leaving Nine West  
with excess inventory that it has had to sell at reduced prices. As 
a result, the company closed 20 stores in the second quarter and 
has become more aggressive in promoting its other product lines, 
like sunglasses and handbags. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Nine West was named earlier this month in a  
price-fixing lawsuit, which claimed the company and several large 
department store chains kept shoe prices artificially high for 
years on 12 brands of women's shoes.

<HEADLINE> New Independent Council Rejected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Attorney General Janet Reno on Friday rejected  
an independent counsel investigation of former White House deputy 
chief of staff Harold Ickes for allegedly lying to a Senate 
committee looking into campaign finances. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no reasonable basis to believe that any additional  
investigation would discover additional evidence sufficient to 
prove that Ickes' testimony was knowingly and intentionally 
false,'' she concluded in a 35-page analysis of the case. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is clear and convincing evidence that Ickes did not  
intend to lie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reno reached her decision at the last minute of a six-month  
inquiry, the maximum time she was allowed under the independent 
counsel act. A special court ordered her conclusions released. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision cut off another possible avenue for transferring to  
an independent counsel a major portion of the Justice Department's 
investigation of 1996 campaign financing. That possibility had been 
raised because Ickes was central to the fund-raising effort behind 
President Clinton's re-election. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton sounded a note of vindication. ``I have always had  
confidence that Harold Ickes acted lawfully and appropriately,'' he 
said in a statement. Ickes' attorneys said they were ``gratified' 
by the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans were upset.  
</P>
<P>
	A clearly disappointed Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., who chaired  
the committee that referred Ickes' testimony to Reno for scrutiny, 
said: ``The demise of the independent counsel law when it expires 
this year may be the most notable 'achievement' of her tenure as 
attorney general.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., who chaired a House committee  
investigation of campaign financing, said, ``The attorney general 
is once again protecting the president and his friends. Janet Reno 
has defied the spirit and the letter of the independent counsel 
statute. ... Her investigation has become a sham.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Late last year, Reno also refused to seek independent counsels  
to investigate Clinton and Vice President Al Gore over 1996 
campaign fund raising. Her task force, which has charged more than 
a dozen people, including prominent Democratic fund-raisers, 
continues to investigate the case. 
</P>
<P>
	The allegation was that Ickes lied in a Sept. 22, 1997, Senate  
Governmental Affairs Committee deposition about Clinton 
administration efforts on behalf of the Teamsters union in a 1995 
strike against Diamond Walnut Co. The Teamsters had contributed to 
Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	Ickes has denied wrongdoing.  
</P>
<P>
	The Senate panel asked: ``What did the administration do  
regarding the Diamond Walnut strike?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ickes responded: ``Nothing that I know of.''  
</P>
<P>
	The question was repeated but there were no follow-up questions  
defining the terms more precisely. 
</P>
<P>
	``The questions asked of Ickes were ambiguous and his answers  
were truthful under a reasonable interpretation of the question,'' 
Reno said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``The serious defects in the questioning, the relatively  
insignificant nature of the underlying event, the extended lapse of 
time, and the absence of any perceivable motive to conceal create 
an insurmountable barrier to the proof of any potential criminal 
violation,'' Reno concluded in her analysis. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno noted that before the key question, Ickes had volunteered  
to the committee that he had talked to Teamsters executive Bill 
Hamilton about Diamond Walnut. She said that ``clearly invited 
follow-up questioning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``That the interrogator never bothered to follow up does not  
change the fact that Ickes gratuitously gave the committee 
investigative leads relating to Diamond Walnut, which is 
inconsistent with having an intent to steer investigators away from 
the Teamsters' connection,'' Reno wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Justice aides, opposing an independent counsel, advised  
Reno that no perjury prosecution could be brought against Ickes 
based on the lone question about the Teamsters strike during the 
Senate deposition. They said the question was too imprecise for a 
perjury case and was not followed up with questions defining its 
terms. 
</P>
<P>
	The independent counsel act bars Reno from using such  
prosecutorial tools as sworn grand jury testimony at this stage. 
Other aides, supporting a counsel, contended that limitation 
prevented her from resolving whether further investigation was 
needed, particularly whether Ickes had criminal intent, as a 
perjury case requires. 
</P>
<P>
	When such questions remain unresolved, the attorney general must  
hand them to an independent counsel empowered to use all tools. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI renewed its long-standing recommendation for a counsel,  
citing an appearance of a conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, Ickes met with Teamsters leaders about the strike. A  
memo prepared for him noted the union gave $2.4 million to 
Democratic candidates in 1992 and suggested the administration 
consider helping on issues like the strike if it wanted continued 
support. 
</P>
<P>
	According to a Teamsters memo, Ickes said he asked then-U.S.  
Trade Representative Mickey Kantor if he would urge Diamond Walnut 
to settle the strike. Ickes acknowledges asking Kantor to make a 
call. 
</P>
<P>
	Kantor says his call was not motivated by fund raising and the  
administration never tried to punish the company. Kantor said he 
merely asked the status of a possible settlement and applied no 
pressure. 
</P>
<P>
	A company executive testified there was no explicit threat but  
the company viewed the call as part of the Teamsters' effort. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno concluded, ``There was nothing improper about Kantor's  
telephone call.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ickes' lawyers have said inquiries do not amount to executive  
action to end the strike.

<HEADLINE> New Orleans Police Getting New Guns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- The Police Department's decision to swap old  
guns for new ones may force New Orleans to defend itself against 
lawsuits like the one it has filed against the firearms industry, 
critics say. 
</P>
<P>
	City police have traded 7,200 confiscated weapons and old 9mm  
service pistols for about 1,700 new Glock .40-caliber weapons. The 
public learned of the deal Wednesday as Mayor Marc Morial and a 
Glock official discussed government suits against the industry on 
NBC's ``Today'' show. 
</P>
<P>
	The trade contradicts the stated desire of Morial, city council  
members and police to reduce gun violence, said Rafael Goyeneche, 
president of the Metropolitan Crime Commission of New Orleans, a 
private watchdog group. 
</P>
<P>
	``To learn that the city has exported 7,000 guns seized from  
street criminals to other parts of the country is really mind 
boggling and the height of the hypocrisy,'' Goyeneche said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's unfortunate, because law enforcement officers risked  
their lives to take these guns away from criminals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, New Orleans and Chicago became the first major cities  
to sue gun makers seeking to recover the costs of gun violence. 
Bridgeport, Conn., and Miami-Dade County in Florida this week 
pursued similar suits. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the deal approved last February, the used guns were not to  
be resold in Louisiana. But Goyeneche said New Orleans could 
actually end up as defendant in one of the lawsuits if one of the 
trade-in guns winds up being used in a crime. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Jannuzzo, Glock's vice president and general counsel, said  
city officials were being hypocritical by simultaneously trading 
guns and suing gun manufacturers. Morial accused Glock of creating 
``a bogus, false issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Linda McDonald, head of the New Orleans chapter of Parents of  
Murdered Children, said authorities should track down the traded 
guns, buy them back and destroy them. 
</P>
<P>
	``The people of the city were under the impression they were  
doing away with these guns,'' McDonald said. ``There's no assurance 
these guns will not come back here, and even if they don't, they 
will be used to kill people in other areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy Police Superintendent Duane Johnson said he expected the  
guns to be sold through a federally licensed dealer to people who 
met legal standards, but couldn't guarantee the guns would not wind 
up back in Louisiana. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the guns will be used for parts and the remaining pieces  
destroyed, Johnson said, although he could not say how many. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson said the department's priority was to equip officers  
with weapons so they would be adequately armed in street 
confrontations. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have an obligation to the people of New Orleans and our  
officers to give them the most technologically advanced equipment 
possible,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Fake FBI Agent Gets 4 Months in Jail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- A man picked the wrong place to  
impersonate an FBI agent -- the house of a real FBI worker -- and 
will pay for it by spending four months in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Gregory Allen Schneider, 27, of Lexington pleaded guilty in  
November to impersonating an agent and to submitting false 
information on a $57,000 mortgage application in a separate case. 
He was sentenced for both charges Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, Schneider approached two youths sitting outside a  
house, showed them a business card identifying him as an FBI agent 
and asked to use the phone. 
</P>
<P>
	One youth said it was OK, but the youth's mother, an FBI  
employee, realized Schneider was not the agent he claimed to be and 
called police, U.S. Attorney Rene Josey said.

<HEADLINE> Jury Awards Ex-Newscaster $8.3 Mil. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Janet Peckinpaugh, a newscaster who  
claimed her gender and age cost her her job, walked out of a 
federal courtroom with an $8.3 million award for discrimination and 
a message for the television news industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's accepted that it's desirable to have a man and a young  
woman paired up as co-anchors,'' she said. ``I think stations will 
think twice about that now before making those decisions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After deliberating for six hours Thursday, a U.S. District Court  
jury found the former WFSB-TV anchor was discriminated against by 
the station because of her gender. It dismissed charges that 
Peckinpaugh, now 48, was ditched because of her age. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury found that WFSB's former owner, Post-Newsweek Stations,  
also violated Peckinpaugh's contract. Bill Ryan, Post-Newsweek's 
president and chief executive, said the company will appeal the 
verdict. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was weakest in terms of market appeal,'' Ryan said. ``The  
decision we made was to simply not renew her contract'' in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Her lawyer, David Golub, argued that she was replaced on the  
station's main newscasts with a younger woman, a demotion that 
destroyed her chances of advancing her career or even making a 
lateral move to another television market. 
</P>
<P>
	Peckinpaugh said she lost her job because of her age, her sex  
and because of retaliation from one of the station's stars, whose 
sexual advances she had spurned. The co-worker, anchor Al Terzi, 
denied making inappropriate sexual advances toward his colleague.

<HEADLINE> Greater Japan Economic Effort Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAVOS, Switzerland (AP) -- The United States Friday stepped up  
pressure on Japan to do more to revive the Asian economy as 
government and business leaders from around the world sought to 
ease global uncertainties. 
</P>
<P>
	In response, a leading Japanese government official assured the  
1,600 officials and corporate executives attending the World 
Economic Forum that Japanese recovery was just around the corner. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Vice President Al Gore led the U.S. campaign urging Japan  
to speed up its recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	``The world looks to Japan to make some appropriate changes in  
the way it discharges its responsibilities as the second-largest 
economy in the world,'' Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin has made it clear that  
Japan's role in the global economy will be a major topic of 
discussion at the six-day conference, which began Thursday. Japan's 
struggling economy has weighed heavily on the rest of Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday, Eisuke Sakakibara, a vice minister at Japan's Ministry  
of Finance, told the forum ``financial panic ... is about to be 
over,'' predicting that Japan's economy will start improving by the 
middle of this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Sakakibara, dubbed ``Mr. Yen'' for his influence in foreign  
exchange markets, met separately with a key U.S. official, Deputy 
Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, to discuss cooperation among 
all of the Group of Seven leading industrialized nations. 
</P>
<P>
	Summers told the forum that the United States cannot do all the  
work of pulling the world out of recession. 
</P>
<P>
	``The world economy cannot fly for very long on one engine, and  
to fly in a healthy way it needs three engines,'' Summers said, 
referring to Japan and Europe as well as the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	He also tempered Sakakibara's optimism, saying, ``I think we  
need to wait before we declare victory.'' He said pending changes 
to Japan's regulatory and tax systems will help determine whether 
Japan's economy has truly regained strength. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Friday, Gore met with Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny  
Primakov, primarily to discuss Russia's budget and U.S. concerns 
over suspected Russian aid to Iran's missile industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia is close to approving a budget that global lenders, led  
by the International Monetary Fund, say is unfeasible. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore and Primakov were joined by other senior officials for the  
economic discussion, but met privately on the arms issue. The 
United States has imposed sanctions on three Russian scientific 
institutions which, it says, helped Iran develop weapons. Russia 
denies the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday's events also featured an emotional farewell address from  
South African President Nelson Mandela. He recalled his previous 
invitations to speak at the annual conference as his country 
changed from apartheid, and cautioned delegates against unguided 
``globalization'' of business interests. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is globalization only to benefit the powerful and the  
financiers, speculators, investors and traders? Does it offer 
nothing to men, women and children who are ravaged by the violence 
of poverty?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``To answer yes to these questions is to recreate the conditions  
for conflict and instability,'' said Mandela, who will step down 
after this year's presidential election. 
</P>
<P>
	``However, if the answer is no then we can begin to build a  
better life for all humanity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also Friday, British Chancellor Gordon Brown said a ``global  
standing committee'' of international and national regulators 
should be created by this summer to oversee the world's financial 
system.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Robber Flees in Wheelchair </HEADLINE>

<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Preying on pedestrians in Chinatown, he  
brandishes a semi-automatic handgun, demands money, then zooms away 
in his motorized wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
	Police haven't caught up with him yet.  
</P>
<P>
	Authorities say the culprit first struck Jan. 20 about 10 p.m.  
when he approached a man returning home. The victim handed over $17 
and the suspect wheeled away, police spokesman Sherman Ackerson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Jan. 26 about 4 a.m., the same suspect confronted a man at a  
busy intersection and again demanded money, police said. This time, 
when the victim handed over a coin purse containing only about $10, 
the robber grew frustrated and threw the money back at him. 
</P>
<P>
	He also is suspected in four additional robberies last year,  
Ackerson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators believe the robber is a former Vietnamese gang  
member who was paralyzed in a gang shooting.

<HEADLINE> 2002 Olympics Sales Unaffected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- The largest corruption scandal in Olympic  
history has not hurt souvenir sales. It may have actually helped. 
</P>
<P>
	``People would ask, `So when's the bribery pin coming out?'''  
said Darin Smedley, who runs a booth in a downtown mall that sells 
only 2002 Olympic items. 
</P>
<P>
	Retailers hawking 2002 Winter Games merchandise say the scandal  
isn't hurting them at all. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most people want souvenirs and they buy them anyway,'' says  
Claire Owen, an employee at a gift shop at the Little America Hotel 
in downtown Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
	Many people may be ``a little disillusioned'' about allegations  
of bribery centered on Salt Lake City's winning bid for the 2002 
Games, Owen said. But she and other retailers say that hasn't 
affected sales of games-related merchandise ranging from lapel pins 
to key chains to baseball caps and T-shirts. 
</P>
<P>
	The collective sigh of relief is almost audible. Retailers were  
worried about the scandal's effects when it first began unfolding 
in late November. 
</P>
<P>
	Smedley said his sales are actually up from last year and  
negative comments about the scandal have dwindled. One reason sales 
didn't drop is because the 40 or so regular customers who buy 
Olympic pins from Smedley didn't panic, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They don't think it's a big deal,'' he said. ``They think the  
media has exploded this into a bigger deal than it really is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the Salt Palace Convention Center gift shop, it's business as  
usual. Sales of Olympics merchandise, though down since the 
Christmas season, are running about the same as last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The trend is being watched closely since royalties paid to the  
Salt Lake Organizing Committee for 2002-related items will help 
fund the city's $1.45 billion games budget. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Olympic Committee won't say whether the scandal has  
hurt sales at its Olympic Spirit stores in Salt Lake and Park City. 
``It's just a little early to determine that yet,'' said USOC 
spokesman Mike Moran. 
</P>
<P>
	The retailers are looking forward to the much-delayed unveiling  
of the official mascot for the 2002 Games -- and the jump in sales 
that might bring. The SLOC announced two weeks ago it was putting 
off the mascot's debut until ongoing bribery investigations were 
complete. 
</P>
<P>
	A new date for the mascot's launch, which dealers believe will  
heat up sales for Olympic pins, will be announced sometime in 
February. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's not a lot of what we call pin fever at this point,''  
said Ron Toth, president of Salt Lake-based Pin Pals International. 
</P>
<P>
	Aminco International, the California-based company licensed to  
make official 2002 Winter Olympic pins, plans to produce 500 to 600 
designs for the SLOC, plus 3,000 to 4,000 more for companies 
sponsoring the games. 
</P>
<P>
	Pin collector John Forester said he has heard other collectors  
make comments about the scandal, but he doesn't think it's affected 
what they buy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, I haven't seen any real change,'' he said, and ``if  
they do away with the Olympics, then those pins will be 
priceless.''

<HEADLINE> Pac-10 Basketball Race Tightens Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- Suddenly, the Pac-10 has a race, not a  
runaway. 
</P>
<P>
	On what had been a stroll toward the championship, third-ranked  
Stanford stumbled at McKale Center, where Arizona almost never 
loses. 
</P>
<P>
	Now 13th-ranked Arizona and No. 11 UCLA are just a game out of  
first place. 
</P>
<P>
	``At least the race isn't over,'' Arizona coach Lute Olson said  
after his Wildcats beat Stanford 78-76 Thursday night. ``Had they 
won, they'd have a two-game lead with 10 to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Olson had said that if Stanford won at Arizona, where the  
Wildcats have a 25-game winning streak, he thought the Cardinal had 
a good chance of becoming the first Pac-10 team to finish a 
conference season undefeated. 
</P>
<P>
	At 17-3 overall and 7-1 in the Pac-10, Stanford's deep,  
experienced team still is the odds-on favorite to win the title. 
Arizona (14-3) and UCLA (15-4) are both 6-2 in league play, and 
UCLA still has to come to McKale in the last game of the regular 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	But Stanford's loss gives hope to the rest of the league that at  
least the championship is no longer a foregone conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinal have a dangerous game Saturday night at Arizona  
State, where first-year coach Rob Evans has the Sun Devils 4-4 in 
conference play after a 69-66 victory over California on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted to win here, but it's always hard to win at  
Arizona,'' Stanford coach Mike Montgomery said after Thursday 
night's game, ``That just makes Saturday an even bigger game for 
us. We have to get a split.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona's victory on Jason Terry's 12-foot jumper with 3.4  
seconds to play was the sixth game in a row that the Wildcats 
either won or lost on the last shot. Those six games have been 
decided by nine points. 
</P>
<P>
	Before Thursday, Arizona had split four intense games at Arizona  
State, New Mexico, Oregon and Oregon State. It's the kind of 
schedule that has helped Olson's young team grow up in a hurry. 
</P>
<P>
	Terry and A.J. Bramlett, Arizona's two seniors, were the big  
players down the stretch. Terry scored 29 points. Bramlett had 16. 
After missing two free throws that cost his team a victory last 
Saturday at Oregon State, Bramlett was 6-for-6 from the line in the 
last 4 1/2 minutes against Stanford. Terry made all 10 of his free 
throws. 
</P>
<P>
	Olson's biggest praise, though, was for his rapidly-maturing  
freshmen. Five of them are in the regular rotation -- Michael 
Wright, Richard Jefferson, Rick Anderson, Ruben Douglas and Traves 
Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even when we went to four tough places to play over the last  
two weeks, I haven't felt like our guys have been intimidated,'' 
Olson said. ``The only time our young guys have been intimidated 
was the first game of the league season at UCLA. I may be wrong, 
but I don't think any crowds on the road are going to bother these 
guys. I think you could see the way they went after people tonight. 
For 40 minutes, they weren't backing down from anybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jefferson, who reminds Olson of Sean Elliott, scored 12 points,  
including a big baseline jumper that put Arizona up 76-72 with 56.8 
seconds left. As is the case with freshmen, though, he also had a 
big mistake, fouling Jarron Collins on a rebound with 11.5 seconds 
remaining. Collins made both free throws to tie it at 76. 
</P>
<P>
	The burly, 6-foot-9 Wright, arguably the Pac-10's best freshman,  
fought Stanford's senior Mark Madsen to a draw much of the night. 
Wright finished nine points but only one rebound. Madsen had 11 
points and nine rebounds, but also committed three turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
	Olson, meanwhile, was wary of a letdown for Saturday's game  
against California. But at least he can count on that McKale 
mystique. Arizona is 166-10 on its home court since the 1987-88 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to be ready to play Saturday afternoon with the same  
enthusiasm we had for this game,'' Olson said. ``And our fans have 
got to get some rest. We need the same kind of effort from them. 
They were crucial for us being able to maintain our adrenaline 
flow.''

<HEADLINE> Wheat Down; Corn, Soybeans Mixed / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Wheat futures prices retreated early today on the  
Chicago Board of Trade, while corn and soybeans were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures fell as rain and snow fell in winter wheat growing  
regions, relieving some concern about warm, dry weather that left 
young crops emerging from dormancy vulnerable to a late-season cold 
snap. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybean futures were mostly lower amid expectations South  
American producers would bring in bumper harvests at the end of 
this growing season, which has had near-ideal weather. Corn futures 
drifted lower in line with the other markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for March delivery fell 1/2 cent to $2.72 3/4 a bushel; March  
corn fell 1/4 cent to $2.15 3/4 a bushel; March oats were unchanged at 
$1.06 1/2 a bushel; March soybeans fell 1/4 cent to $5.10 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Meat and livestock futures were mostly lower on the Chicago  
Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	February live cattle fell .07 cent to 62.10 cents a pound; March  
feeder cattle fell .30 cent to 72.62 cents a pound; February lean 
hogs fell .70 cent to 41.25 cents a pound; February pork bellies 
fell .50 cent to 55.20 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Griffey Has Win Now Attitude </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Ken Griffey Jr. is putting more pressure on the  
Seattle Mariners to win. 
</P>
<P>
	If they don't, the former AL MVP might choose to leave as a free  
agent after the 2000 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``In a nutshell, this is the most important year for the  
Mariners,'' the All-Star center fielder told the Seattle 
Post-Intelligencer in an interview from his offseason home in 
Orlando, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	``This will decide whether I stay or go,'' Griffey said. ``I  
don't know how they're going to do anything to improve the 
ballclub. They may not improve the ballclub. All I know is they 
have a new ballpark and we need to put people in those seats. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to have a good product, just like the movies. A couple  
of bad reviews and seats will be empty. That's why this is an 
important year. It has nothing to do with me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Mariners are scheduled to move from the Kingdome to Safeco  
Field, which has a retractable roof, in July. 
</P>
<P>
	Griffey hit 56 home runs for the second straight season in 1998,  
but the Mariners went 76-85 and finished third in the AL West. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mariners decided they didn't want to extend Randy Johnson's  
contract and finished 11 1/2 games behind Texas in their division and 
1 1/2 games ahead of last-place Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Griffey, All-Star shortstop Alex Rodriguez also  
is eligible for free agency after the 2000 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Mariners have got to convince people to stay here,''  
Griffey said. ``They need to do that by putting a good ballclub on 
the field. ... I've spent 10 years helping this organization. The 
people in Seattle have helped the organization by agreeing to build 
a new ballpark. It's time for the Mariners and everyone in the 
organization to be on the same page. That's everybody; ownership, 
players, coaches. Everybody.''

<HEADLINE> Labor Peace Seen for Sydney Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Union officials said a Sydney Olympic  
Games free of labor problems was all but guaranteed Friday by the 
signing of an agreement covering 50,000 site workers. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal provides pay raises of up to 12 percent, attendance  
bonuses to stop absenteeism and special overtime rates for working

	New South Wales Labour Council secretary Michael Costa said the  
council would ``ensure that the games will continue without any 
industrial disputation.'' 
</P>

outside the agreement, Costa said unions were committed to a 
successful 2000 Games and ``this award clearly demonstrates our

<HEADLINE> Maine Court Upholds Child Porn Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Maine (AP) -- A federal appeals court upheld a federal  
law that makes it illegal to possess computer images that look like 
children engaged in sex. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling, made Thursday by the 1st Circuit Court of Appeals in  
Boston, stems from a case in Maine. 
</P>
<P>
	The law targets computer technology that can be used to alter an  
innocent image of a child into a picture of a child engaged in a 
sexually explicit act. Under the law, it is illegal to possess 
images regardless of whether they show a real child or an altered 
image. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Gene Carter ruled in April that the law was  
unconstitutionally vague in the case against a Norway, Maine, man. 
He said the statute could impact lawful adult pornography. 
</P>
<P>
	Reversing Carter's decision, the appeals court said the law is  
not so vague that a consumer could not understand what type of 
pornography is illegal under the law. 
</P>
<P>
	``A jury must decide, based on the totality of the  
circumstances, whether a reasonable unsuspecting viewer would 
consider the depiction to be of an actual individual less than 18 
engaged in sexual activity,'' Judge Hugh Brownes wrote for the 
appeals panel. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the first time a federal appeals court has ruled on the  
Child Pornography Protection Act of 1996, U.S. Attorney Jay 
McCloskey said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We term it a landmark decision that brings our federal child  
pornography laws into the computer age,'' said Mark Terison, a 
federal prosecutor. ``That's what Congress was trying to do, and 
this opinion finds it constitutional.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Because of Thursday's ruling, McCloskey said his office would  
pursue charges against David Hilton, 48, of Norway, who was charged 
with possession of child pornography. 
</P>
<P>
	Hilton characterized himself as an anti-pornography crusader and  
met with FBI and Customs officials on a number of occasions to 
discuss material that was sent to him via the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	But federal officials eventually began to suspect Hilton's  
motives were less pure. He continued to collect the material 
despite warnings that it was illegal to do so, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hilton said he was not aware of the ruling and would have to  
talk to his lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm still going to fight it,'' he said in a telephone  
interview. ``There's a lot to this that hasn't been made public. 
The fact of the matter is I'm not guilty of what they're saying.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hilton's lawyer did not return a message left at his office  
Friday evening. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal law was also the subject of an appeal in California  
after a judge ruled the law is constitutional. The defendant 
appealed to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, which has not yet 
ruled.

<HEADLINE>  Fighting in Kosovo Kills 24 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Serb police stormed a village today  
in southwestern Kosovo, killing 24 ethnic Albanians in a raid that 
they said also left one of their officers dead. 
</P>
<P>
	To the north of the capital Pristina, Yugoslav army tanks began  
firing at Kosovo Liberation Army positions near the village of 
Ljupce, resuming an assault they began earlier this week. People 
fled on tractors and horse carts. 
</P>
<P>
	The raid on Rogovo comes two weeks after the bodies of 45 ethnic  
Albanians were found in another Kosovo village. Those killings 
broke the October ceasefire, prompting an intense round of 
international diplomacy and new NATO threats of military 
intervention. 
</P>
<P>
	Today the United States and five other nations called all  
parties in the year-old conflict to an international conference 
Feb. 6 to negotiate a settlement granting ``substantial autonomy'' 
-- but not independence -- to the majority Albanian province. 
</P>
<P>
	But both warring sides sent signals they opposed the  
international proposal. President Slobodan Milosevic's government 
said it would not accept the KLA as a full partner in talks until 
it renounces violence while the KLA was sticking to its position 
that the Serbs must withdraw. 
</P>
<P>
	International monitors of the ceasefire in Kosovo said 24 ethnic  
Albanians and a Serb officer were killed in the raid early today in 
Rogovo, two miles from the Albanian border. 
</P>
<P>
	The monitors said most of the dead were men killed in and around  
a red minibus riddled with bullets. Serb police said the dead were 
rebel fighters. 
</P>
<P>
	Three of the dead were clad in the boots and uniforms of the  
Kosovo Liberation Army, which is fighting for independence from 
Serbia, the main republic of Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Kalashnikov rifles and other weapons lay beside some of the  
victims, found face down in pools of blood. 
</P>
<P>
	Sandy Blyth, spokesman for the Organization for Security and  
Cooperation in Europe, called the deaths ``shocking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We have another incident involving a great number of deaths  
and we're trying to ascertain events as they happened,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO on Thursday reinforced its threat to use force to stop the  
fighting if Serbs and Kosovo Albanians don't cooperate with the 
international peace initiative. 
</P>
<P>
	Today President Clinton declared NATO ``united and ready to  
act.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The international community has sent a clear message to the  
authorities in Belgrade: The time for denial and delay is past,'' 
Clinton said in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said he would fly Saturday  
to Belgrade and Pristina to deliver the invitation to the peace 
conference, which is to be held in France. 
</P>
<P>
	Cook spoke after a meeting in London today of the six-nation  
Contact Group, whose members are the United States, Britain, 
France, Germany, Italy and Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	The Contact Group said along with entering peace talks that  
Serbs must stop ``all offensive actions/repression'' in Kosovo and 
promote the safe return of people displaced by the conflict. The 
U.N. refugee agency said today it estimates 30,000 people have been 
displaced by fighting in the last month. 
</P>
<P>
	French President Jacques Chirac and British Prime Minister Tony  
Blair also lent weight to the drive for international peace talks, 
saying in a joint statement they would commit ground troops to 
Kosovo as reinforcement for a political solution. 
</P>
<P>
	The international strategy is to pressure the ethnic Albanians  
to unite their fractious community and force all parties to the 
negotiating table to prevent the violence from exploding by spring, 
as is widely feared. 
</P>
<P>
	In Pristina, Kosovo's leading moderate politician, Ibrahim  
Rugova, said he was ready to participate in such a conference, even 
though its aim is to negotiate an interim formula and not his 
``ultimate goal'' of independence. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Kosovo is a province of Serbia, the dominant Yugoslav  
republic, its population is 90 percent ethnic Albanian. 
</P>
<P>
	Without mentioning names, Rugova urged ``all representatives''  
of Kosovo's political factions to join at the table under his 
leadership. That would include the KLA, which has opposed Rugova's 
pacifist strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	The KLA has long rejected the idea of a peace conference unless  
it leads to full independence and unless Serb forces withdraw from 
the province. 
</P>
<P>
	A KLA representative, Pleurat Sediu, said in London after the  
Contact Group meeting that the rebels had yet to announce a formal 
position on the plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``But while Serbian forces are shelling our villages, killing  
our people, our children, we will not discuss anything,'' he told 
the British Broadcasting Corp. ``There is no point going to talks 
with guns pointed to our forehead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Milosevic issued a statement saying ``problems in Kosovo should  
be solved ``through direct political dialogue between the 
representatives of national communities that live in Kosovo ... and 
state bodies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Serb officials have rejected any talks that include the KLA,  
whom they brand ``terrorists.''

<HEADLINE> Japan Distributes Shopping Vouchers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Hoping to tempt the country to spend its way out of  
the worst recession in decades, the Japanese government distributed 
its first batch of shopping vouchers Friday to eligible consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents of Hamada, 435 miles southwest of Tokyo, were the  
first to receive the coupons, valued at $170 and valid for a 
limited time, newspapers and TV news reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Other local governments will join the program in the upcoming  
months, handing out a total of $6 billion worth of vouchers by 
March 31 in hopes of spurring the country's anemic domestic 
consumption. 
</P>
<P>
	Part of a government stimulus package hammered out last year,  
the vouchers will go out to households with children aged 15 or 
younger and to the elderly, or approximately 35 million households 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Friday, the Economic Planning Agency released a quarterly  
report saying consumer confidence had edged up slightly in December 
after hitting a record low in September. 
</P>
<P>
	But sentiment is still low, said Takafusa Shiyoya, the agency's  
administrative vice minister. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't say that consumer sentiment has recovered,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Shioya said he hopes distribution of the vouchers will help  
boost consumer sentiment. Nearly 60 percent of Japan's gross 
domestic product comes from individual consumption.

<HEADLINE> US Studies Chemical Attack Defense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon is fashioning a plan for how the  
military would intervene in a biological or chemical attack on the 
United States, and Defense Secretary William Cohen favors the 
appointment of a senior officer to coordinate the use of troops, a 
senior Pentagon official said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton, citing the likelihood of a domestic incident  
involving chemical or biological weapons, said last week the 
federal government needs to be better prepared for how to respond. 
He has asked the Defense Department to work out ways it can 
coordinate military support for a lead civilian agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen intends to present a detailed plan to Clinton by the end  
of this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea is to create a ``joint task force commander,'' probably  
a two-star general or admiral, who would plan and lead the military 
response to a terrorist attack with medical units and 
chemical-biological defense experts, the official said, speaking on 
condition of anonymity. Most of the team would be comprised of 
National Guard and reserve units rather than active-duty forces, 
the official added. 
</P>
<P>
	The commander has not yet been named, nor has it been decided  
where he or she would fit in the existing military command 
structure. It is likely the joint task force and its commander 
would be part of U.S. Atlantic Command, based at Norfolk, Va., the 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
	There was some talk of establishing a commander in chief for the  
defense of the continental United States -- akin to existing 
commands for the use of U.S. forces abroad -- but that has been set 
aside out of fear that it would be seen as too close to being a 
national police force, infringing on civil liberties, the official 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some senior Pentagon officials worry that even the present plan  
of designating a special group to help civilian agencies deal with 
a chemical or biological attack will lead to charges from civil 
libertarians and others that the military is playing too large a 
role in law enforcement affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is putting the Department of Defense into a position that  
we are quite uneasy about, quite frankly,'' the senior official 
said. ``Like it or not, this is something we have to plan for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One step already in the works is the creation of 10 teams, known  
as Rapid Assessment, Identification and Detection, or Raids, in the 
National Guard. Each will have its own geographic area of 
responsibility and will be charged with reaching the scene of a 
chemical or biological attack within four hours in order to help 
civilian responders determine what agent was used in the attack and 
its extent. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's fiscal 2000 budget, to be submitted to Congress on  
Monday, includes about $250 million over six years for RAID teams. 
</P>
<P>
	In a speech last September, Cohen said such preparation was  
needed in a ``grave new world'' featuring unconventional security 
threats at home, such as terrorist attacks using weapons of mass 
destruction. ``We can no longer think of terrorists as malefactors 
who attack American interests abroad,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> GOP, Democrats Fight Over Surplus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans and Democrats fought today over  
how to use the nearly $2.6 trillion in federal surpluses that the 
Congressional Budget Office now envisions for the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
	June O'Neill, the outgoing director of the nonpartisan budget  
office, presented the Senate Budget Committee projections showing 
an unbroken continuation of surpluses that began abruptly last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Most lawmakers agree with President Clinton's call to use the  
bulk of the surpluses to buttress Social Security for the looming 
retirement of baby boomers, although there are partisan differences 
over how to do it. 
</P>
<P>
	But the CBO report mapped a coming political battlefield by  
projecting that almost one-third of the $2.6 trillion surplus -- 
some $787 billion -- would come from the non-Social Security side of 
the budget, beginning in 2001. For years, that portion of the 
budget has been running in deficit, and the two parties have 
conflicting views over what to do with the surplus. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Budget Chairman Pete Domenici, R-N.M., voiced the  
predominant GOP view that part of the surplus should be used for 
tax cuts -- in part to prevent Democrats from using it for increased 
spending. 
</P>
<P>
	``Only we can make the decision whether we think Congress would  
sit by and watch the surplus accumulate and not spend it,'' 
Domenici said. ``That's the problem we've got. The prospensity is 
to spend it if it's there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the panel's ranking Democrat, Sen. Frank Lautenberg of New  
Jersey, said the figures showed Clinton's policies were working. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now we have to build on them and prepare for our nation's  
future,'' Lautenberg said. ``That means saving Social Security, 
strengthening Medicare and cutting taxes for ordinary Americans to 
encourage savings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his State of the Union address on Jan. 19, Clinton proposed  
setting aside $2.7 trillion over the next 15 years for Social 
Security. He would use the rest of the surplus -- about $1.7 
trillion -- for Medicare, the health insurance program for the 
elderly; to help set up private retirement accounts for Americans; 
and for defense and domestic programs. 
</P>
<P>
	An aide to Lautenberg said the senator's reference to cutting  
taxes indicated support for the retirement accounts plus other 
reductions like tax breaks for long-term health care, which Clinton 
also has proposed. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton will release his own budget for fiscal 2000 on Monday.  
It will include his own updated surplus projections, which analysts 
expect to roughly track the CBO figures. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's budget will show the non-Social Security portion of  
the budget being exactly in balance in 2001 and reaching a $44 
billion surplus in 2002, said Democrats who spoke on condition of 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The CBO numbers were expected for weeks as analysts concluded  
that the healthy economy was continuing to pour money into federal 
coffers faster than previously expected. That same phenomenon 
produced a $70 billion surplus for fiscal 1998, which ended Sept. 
30, the first federal surplus in three decades and the largest 
ever. 
</P>
<P>
	The strong projections came even though CBO analysts assumed  
that economic growth in 1999 and 2000 would be 2 percent a year, 
well below the 3.7 percent average of the past three years. O'Neill 
cautioned that the surplus projections could prove optimistic or 
pessimistic, depending upon how the economy performs. 
</P>
<P>
	Just three weeks ago, Clinton announced that the 1999 surplus  
would be at least $76 billion. But CBO projected that figure would 
be $107 billion -- more than 50 percent above the 1998 total. 
</P>
<P>
	CBO projected a 2000 surplus of $131 billion. Through the  
following nine years, the budget office estimated that the figure 
would rise annually, hitting $381 billion in 2009, the last year 
for which numbers were projected. 
</P>
<P>
	Last August, the budget office projected $1.5 trillion in  
surpluses between 1999 and 2008. It also projected much lower 
surpluses for the non-Social Security part of the budget then: a 
10-year total of just $31 billion.

<HEADLINE> Settlement Reached in Woodward Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Former British au pair Louise Woodward was barred  
today from profiting from her story under a settlement with the 
family who had sued her over their child's death. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Woodward, convicted of manslaughter for the death of  
8-month-old Matthew Eappen, was sued in federal court last year by 
the infant's parents. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement, reached before the case went to trial, ensures  
that Ms. Woodward ``does not profit from the killing of their 
8-month-old baby,'' the Eappens' lawyer, Fredric Ellis, said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Barrow, Ms. Woodward's lawyer in England, said the ruling  
had little effect. ``Louise has always maintained that she has no 
intention to profit from her story, and Louise continued to 
maintain her innocence,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ellis would not say whether there was any monetary award to the  
Eappens or to charity. Both Ellis and Barrow said details of the 
settlement were confidential. 
</P>
<P>
	Drs. Deborah and Sunil Eappen had filed suit in June after the  
state's highest court upheld Ms. Woodward's conviction, but allowed 
her to return to her hometown of Elton, England. 
</P>
<P>
	During her criminal trial, supporters of Ms. Woodward had  
gathered in pubs in England, rallied outside Massachusetts 
courthouses and raised over $400,000 in her support. Meanwhile, 
Eappen family supporters expressed their fury that Ms. Woodward has 
been elevated to ``folk hero'' status. 
</P>
<P>
	A jury had convicted Ms. Woodward of second-degree murder for  
Matthew's February 1997 death, but the trial judge reduced the 
conviction to manslaughter and sentenced her to the 279 days she 
had served during the proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Woodward, 18 at the time, had been caring for the Eappens'  
two young boys -- Matthew and his then-2 1/2-year-old brother, Brendan 
-- when she called police to say the baby had stopped breathing. 
</P>
<P>
	Matthew was hospitalized in a coma and died five days later, on  
Feb. 9, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	During the trial, prosecutors argued that the infant had been  
shaken and his head violently smashed against a hard object. Ms. 
Woodward's lawyers argued that the injury to the child happened 
weeks before he fell ill. 
</P>
<P>
	When they filed the suit, the Eappens asked for several million  
dollars in compensatory and punitive damages. Ms. Woodward first 
ignored the civil suit and was found in default, and a federal 
judge said she would be liable for punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge later allowed lawyers to defend her in a trial to  
determine how much in damages she would be required to pay. 
</P>
<P>
	Under settlement terms, if Ms. Woodward makes money from her  
story, the proceeds would be given to UNICEF. 
</P>
<P>
	But if Ms. Woodward tries to keep any money herself, the Eappens  
would go to court to demand the money be given to a Chicago-based 
nonprofit foundation, established in their baby's name. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Eappens filed suit, some legal experts questioned  
whether any ban on profits ordered by a U.S. court could be 
enforced in England. 
</P>
<P>
	Ellis said he believed today's agreement is enforceable  
overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a contract and with any contract there's always a chance  
it won't be honored,'' he said. ``If she doesn't honor it, we will 
bring another action and that action would have to be in England.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although the settlement prevents Ms. Woodward from profiting, it  
cannot be enforced against her parents, Gary and Susan Woodward, 
Ellis said. 
</P>
<P>
	In June, Mrs. Woodward denied accusations that she forged a  
housing bill to get money from her daughter's legal defense fund, 
and the fund's trustees said they backed the mother. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman for EF Au Pair, the agency that brought Ms.  
Woodward to America and helped pay for her legal defense, said the 
agency was not involved in the settlement, although lawyers from 
the company's insurance agency represented Ms. Woodward in court.

<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Pictures of Princes Charles with longtime love  
Camilla Parker Bowles grabbed the front pages in Britain today, the 
kind of frantic coverage once generated by Princess Diana. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple deliberately raised their public profile Thursday  
night by emerging together from a birthday party for Mrs. Parker 
Bowles' sister at the Ritz Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	Masses of photographers, many of whom had staked out their  
positions the day before, waited eagerly across the road. 
</P>
<P>
	Two minutes before midnight, the prince and Mrs. Parker Bowles  
walked down the stairs together, and hesitated briefly at the curb 
as their car pulled up. She climbed into the back seat on the left 
side, he went around to the right and climbed in beside her, and 
the car drove them away. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sun (headline: ``Meet the Mistress'') devoted its first five  
pages to the event, as did The Mirror (``At Last!'') 
</P>
<P>
	``He doesn't have to woo Camilla. It is the British people who  
must be won over,'' The Mirror commented. 
</P>
<P>
	The Independent, with extraordinary coyness, ran a front-page  
picture of the ladders set up by photographers outside the Ritz. 
The caption said the occasion was ``the 50th birthday of Annabel 
Elliot, an art dealer,'' and didn't mention that she was Mrs. 
Parker Bowles' sister. 
</P>
<P>
	Diana, who was divorced from Charles in 1996 and died the  
following year, had considered Mrs. Parker Bowles the reason her 
marriage broke down. 
</P>
<P>
	David Starkey, honorary lecturer in history at the London School  
of Economics, commented that the photograph was ``purely a question 
of politics.''

<HEADLINE> Knievel Doing Well After Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Daredevil stuntman Evel Knievel is on the  
mend and could be back on his motorcycle in six weeks, his doctor 
said Friday two days after performing a liver transplant. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no signs of rejecting the long-awaited organ and  
Knievel, 60, was expected to be moved out of intensive care soon, 
Dr. Hector Ramos said at Tampa General Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramos, head of the transplant team, implanted a donated liver  
during a five and a half hour operation. 
</P>
<P>
	``The operation went remarkably well,'' Ramos said. By Friday,  
Knievel was in stable condition, breathing on his own. 
</P>
<P>
	Within six weeks, barring complications, Knievel should be able  
to do just about anything he was used to doing -- including riding 
his motorcycle. Normal recovery time is three-to-six months. 
</P>
<P>
	Attitude helps tremendously, the surgeon said.  
</P>
<P>
	``The will to live and general tenacity of his personality is  
what will be instrumental in his recovery. He's a fighter, of 
course. That's his history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Knievel did not attend the briefing.  
</P>
<P>
	He believes he contracted liver-destroying Hepatitis C during  
the many transfusions he needed following spills on the motorcycle 
circuit in the 1960s and 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	During his career, Knievel broke at least 35 bones and underwent  
surgery 14 times. His motorcycle stunts included a jump over the 
35-foot fountain at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas in 1967 when he 
crushed his pelvis after flying head-over-handlebars. 
</P>
<P>
	One of his most famous stunts failed when a parachute opened as  
he zoomed over Idaho's Snake River Canyon in 1974. The following 
year, a crowd of 90,000 at Wembley Stadium in London watched as he 
soared over 13 double-tiered buses and then crashed, again 
fracturing his pelvis. 
</P>
<P>
	He ended his stunt career in 1981.  
</P>
<P>
	Knievel waited eight months for a new liver. He was hospitalized  
briefly recently with dehydration, which is a common symptom of the 
progression of liver disease, Ramos said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the call came that there was a match, said Krystal  
Kennedy, Knievel's 29-year-old fiancee. Within two hours they were 
at Tampa General. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramos said 70 percent of liver transplant patients get back to  
normal. Knievel still has Hepatitis C and while his new liver does 
not have it, the chances of getting it are high. But the disease is 
not so likely to destroy the organ this time, Ramos said.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Rises Broadly As U.S. Booms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar rose broadly Friday as gross domestic  
product figures portrayed the United States as a racing economic 
engine in a world limping through financial crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the dollar's rise against the yen was minimal, with  
trading against the Japanese currency hobbled by the continuing 
recession there. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro was quoted at $1.1345 in late New York trading, falling  
from $1.1410 late Thursday. During the trading day, the euro fell 
to $1.1340, its lowest level since its debut at the beginning of 
the month. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was trading at 116.43 yen, up from 116.40 on  
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders embraced the dollar Friday as the Commerce Department  
revealed that the U.S. economy grew at an astounding 5.6 percent 
annual rate during the final quarter of 1998. Gross domestic 
product for all of last year increased by 3.9 percent -- with low 
inflation to boot. 
</P>
<P>
	With similar reports for 1997 and 1996, the United States just  
ended its most productive three-year period of growth since 
1984-86. 
</P>
<P>
	Economist Allen Sinai called the last three months of 1998 a  
``blowout quarter'' in a ``blowout year for the U.S. economy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street celebrated, sending the Dow Jones industrial average  
up sharply, and U.S. Treasury bond prices rose. 
</P>
<P>
	``It reflects the diverging growth paths the United States and  
Europe are taking,'' said John McCarthy, a senior vice president 
for foreign exchange at ING Barings Capital Markets. ``In Europe, 
they keep revising (economic forecasts) down. There's still growth 
there, but it's not as robust.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar was quoted at 1.4147 Swiss francs, up from 1.4103,  
and 1.5108 Canadian dollars, down from 1.5183. The British pound 
fell to $1.6461 from $1.6493. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on Thursday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.7238 German 
marks, up from 1.7141; 5.7803 French francs, up from 5.7504; and 
1,706.48 Italian lire, up from 1,697.79.

	Economy Grows at 5.6 Percent Rate  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's economy ended 1998 with the  
strongest growth in 2 1/2 years, turning in a stellar performance for 
the third consecutive year. Consumers' appetite for houses and cars 
and businesses' hunger for computers shielded the United States 
from the slump that swept the globe. ``These are the best economic 
times in living memory,'' said Commerce Department Under Secretary 
Robert J. Shapiro. ``In December, we broke the record for the 
longest peacetime expansion in American history.'' The gross 
domestic product -- the total of goods and services produced within 
U.S. borders -- increased at a seasonally and inflation-adjusted 
annual rate of 5.6 percent in the October-December quarter, the 
best since the spring of 1996, the department said.

	Stocks End Higher; Dow Up 77.50

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks posted strong gains today after  
recovering from a wobbly morning, as technology shares bounced 
backed from their lows and investors refocused on a morning report 
showing continued strength in the U.S. economy. At the close, the 
Dow Jones industrial average was up 77.50 points at 9,358.83. The 
blue-chip index rose 49 points in the first minutes of trading, 
then dropped to negative 57 points before recovering. Despite the 
gain in the Dow, advancing issues were barely leading decliners on 
the New York Stock Exchange. Broader stock indicators were mostly 
higher after an early morning selloff. The Nasdaq composite index 
rose 28.34 to 2,505.68.

	Greater Japan Economic Effort Urged  
</P>
<P>
	DAVOS, Switzerland (AP) -- The United States today stepped up  
pressure on Japan to do more to revive the Asian economy as 
government and business leaders from around the world sought to 
ease global uncertainties. A leading Tokyo official said Japanese 
recovery is just around the corner. U.S. Vice President Al Gore 
said at the World Economic Forum: ``The world looks to Japan to 
make some appropriate changes in the way it discharges its 
responsibilities as the second-largest economy in the world.''

	Japan Pushes Consumer Spending  
</P>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The Japanese government handed out shopping  
vouchers in a city in southwestern Japan, the first part of a plan 
to put $6 billion in shoppers' hands nationwide by the end of 
March. The project is Japan's most direct -- and desperate -- tactic 
yet to prod its tight-fisted consumers into spending their way out 
of the country's worst recession since the end of World War II. 
Residents in Hamada, 435 miles southwest of Tokyo, turned out in 
droves to collect the stylish coupons, paid for by the central 
government and distributed by municipalities, mostly for use in 
local shops. Kyodo News agency reported 2,500 people showed up.

	Brazil Currency Below Key Level  
</P>
<P>
	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Brazil's currency, the real, sank  
below the psychologically important level of two to the U.S. dollar 
as President Fernando Henrique Cardoso complained about 
speculation. Before recovering a bit at the close, the real was as 
low as 2.14 to the dollar, a drop of almost 9 percent from 
yesterday's close of 1.95. The real closed at 2.06 to the dollar, 
or 48.5 cents. That was a plunge of 41 percent from its close of 
1.21 to the dollar on Jan. 12, a day before the currency was 
devalued. It was the first time the real had slipped below two to 
the dollar since it was established in July 1994.

<P>
	SEC Suspends Trading in 6 Stocks  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Securities and Exchange Commission today  
suspended trading in shares of six small companies. In separate 
announcements about each company, the SEC said it took the actions 
because of questions about the accuracy of the official company 
statements. The trading halts are standard 10-day suspensions, and 
will continue through 11:59 p.m. EST on Feb. 11. Although the SEC 
did not elaborate, it is assumed an investigation of each company 
was under way. A recent report by MSNBC columnist Christopher Byron 
claimed the six companies are secretly linked and have seen their 
share prices soar, creating a combined market capitalization of 
$1.2 billion ``out of nothing but hot air and empty press 
releases.''

third-largest railroad company, has settled a class-action lawsuit 
claiming race discrimination. U.S. District Judge U.W. Clemon in 
Birmingham, Ala., who had approved the settlement Dec. 17, today 
overruled an objection to the agreement by a former employee, said 
Shirley Brown, the judge's docket clerk. Terms of the settlement, 
which affects thousands of black union employees in operating 
crafts, were not disclosed. The employees' suit filed in 1994 
accused Jacksonville-based CSX Transportation of discriminating 
against black workers in areas of employment policies, practices 
and procedures.

	Microsoft Trial Videos To Be Public  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal appeals court reluctantly agreed  
that an obscure 1913 law allows the public to see the entire 
videotape of Microsoft's billionaire chairman, Bill Gates, 
struggling through three days of interviews by government lawyers. 
The decision also opens roughly 100 other depositions already taken 
in the government's high-profile antitrust case against Microsoft, 
including interviews with some of the high-tech industry's most 
powerful players, such as top executives of Intel Corp., IBM Corp., 
Apple Computer Corp. and Netscape Communications Corp. And the 
ruling effectively ensures the public can attend any future 
interviews with executives related to the trial.

	LTV Blames Loss on Steel Imports  
</P>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Steel maker LTV Corp., blaming cheap imports,  
reported a $61 million fourth-quarter loss and a 14 percent drop in 
quarterly sales today. The loss, which amounted to 62 cents per 
share, included pretax charges of $55 million. In last year's 
fourth quarter, LTV earned $32 million, or 31 cents a share. Sales 
fell to $989 million, from $1.15 billion last year. Excluding the 
extraordinary charges, which covered the costs of closing certain 
facilities and cutting jobs, LTV's loss was $14 million, or 15 
cents a share. That topped analysts' expectations of a loss of 18 
cents per share.

	Kellogg Earnings Picture Mixed

<P>
	BATTLE CREEK, Mich. (AP) -- Kellogg Co.'s fourth-quarter earnings  
more than tripled compared to a year earlier, when earnings were 
depressed by huge restructuring costs. But Kellogg's operating 
results, which exclude any such special costs, dropped 41 percent 
as the company battled lower-price cereal competitors and changing 
breakfast habits. Kellogg earned $46.8 million, or 11 cents per 
share, in the last three months of 1998, which included special 
charges of $46.3 million to pay for a reorganization plan. Kellogg 
stock was down 1 7/16 at 40 5/8 today.

<HEADLINE> Judge Demands a Microsoft E-Mail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Microsoft says it had nothing to hide, but the  
government pointed to efforts to avoid surrendering an e-mail that 
threatens to undermine one of the company's legal arguments in its 
antitrust trial. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge Thursday ordered Microsoft to hand over the document.  
</P>
<P>
	The internal e-mail from a software engineer in October 1998  
explains in unprecedented detail some of the ways Microsoft 
combined its Internet browser software into its dominant Windows 
operating system. The government charges the combination amounts to 
illegal ``tying'' under federal antitrust law. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft's unease about the e-mail was evident. In part, the  
company claimed the note was covered under attorney privilege 
because one of its lawyers was included in the e-mail's ``cc'' 
(carbon copy) field. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course, copying a document to an attorney does not make it  
privileged,'' the government complained in court papers that called 
the argument ``spurious.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After Microsoft lawyer Steven Holley told U.S. District Judge  
Thomas Penfield Jackson, ``I'm not trying to hide the ball here,'' 
the judge ordered the company to turn it over. 
</P>
<P>
	``They recognized the harmful character of the document,''  
Justice Department lawyer David Boies said outside court. 
</P>
<P>
	But Bill Neukom, the company's lead in-house lawyer, told  
reporters: ``We didn't have anything to hide.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The government said the e-mail supports claims that Microsoft  
easily can identify which parts of shared computer code relate to 
Windows and which parts relate to its browser, a necessary 
distinction if it were ordered to separate the products. 
</P>
<P>
	The e-mail's author, David D'Souza, cautioned that part of his  
analysis ``may not be useful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An earlier government witness, computer scientist Edward Felten  
of Princeton University, wrote a program to disable Microsoft's 
browser within Windows. 
</P>
<P>
	Felten testified, however, that he did not try to distinguish  
which parts of shared code are responsible for which functions -- 
the precise study that D'Souza undertook. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's plenty of stuff in there that has no relation at all  
to Web browsing, ... and yet it's in there,'' Felten said. ``If 
there's code that's in there that can be removed, then certainly 
Microsoft is able to remove it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft contends separating its browser from Windows is  
impossible and that doing so would seriously degrade Windows and 
make it run more slowly. 
</P>
<P>
	D'Souza also notes that more than half the shared code in a  
single important file performs functions for both Windows and the 
browser, suggesting a tight integration of the products. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly, the integration is good,'' D'Souza wrote. ``There is  
a HUGE amount of sharing and commonality here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The government alleges that Microsoft's decision to bundle its  
browser within Windows is ``tying,'' illegal under antitrust law 
because it requires consumers who buy one product also to buy 
another. It contends the company was trying to ``crush'' Netscape 
Communications Corp., which makes a popular rival browser. 
</P>
<P>
	Back in the courtroom, Microsoft continued its questioning  
Thursday of Paul Maritz, senior executive responsible for the 
company's most important consumer products. The trial is recessed 
until Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Maritz argued that Microsoft faces upstart competition in the  
high-tech industry, even though Windows is used by more than 80 
percent of the world's desktop computers. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are occasions in this industry when you reach a point  
where new things become possible,'' said Maritz. ``The Internet 
effect is having a fairly widespread impact on our whole 
industry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boies, the government's lead lawyer, responded that ``no  
monopoly entirely eliminates competitive threats'' and described 
what he called Microsoft's ``present-day monopoly power that has 
lasted more than a decade.''

<HEADLINE> Challengers Aim To Beat Silver Charm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HALLANDALE, Fla. (AP) -- Although Silver Charm has finished first  
or second in 19 of his 20 lifetime starts, several trainers and 
jockeys think the big gray horse is ripe for the taking in the 
$500,000 Donn Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
	Two factors are fueling their confidence. Silver Charm's high  
weight of 126 pounds is six to 16 more than any of his competitors, 
and he'll be starting from the far outside of the 12-horse field. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anytime you draw outside, it costs you a couple of lengths no  
matter who you are, and he's a great horse,'' said H. James Bond, 
who trains 12-1 shot Behrens. 
</P>
<P>
	Silver Charm, who opened as the 8-5 early favorite, is the  
unquestioned star attraction for today's race at Gulfstream Park. 
</P>
<P>
	With $6,633,006 in earnings for owners Bob and Beverly Lewis,  
the California entry is aiming to become thoroughbred racing's 
first $10 million horse. Cigar holds the record with $9,999,815. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every time he runs, there's no easy spot for him,'' trainer  
Bob Baffert said. ``People like to run against him because they 
know how much interest in the race he brings. Everybody wants to be 
a part of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Silver Charm won the San Pasqual Handicap at Santa Anita in his  
first start of the year Jan. 10. But the weight factor and his No. 
12 starting position have rivals thinking they have a chance. 
</P>
<P>
	Ralph Ziadie, trainer of 4-1 second favorite Sir Bear, has been  
predicting an upset all week. Sir Bear has won his past two starts 
since switching to jockey Jerry Bailey, taking in the Cigar Mile at 
Aqueduct and this month's Broward Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like Jerry has a clock in his head,'' Ziadie said. '' He  
can go to the front if necessary, or if there is a fast pace he can 
come from off the pace. He can do whatever is necessary to win, and 
I think he is going to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Puerto Madero, who shipped in from California with Silver Charm,  
is another serious challenger after winning 10 of 15 lifetime 
starts, including last month's Native Diver Handicap at Hollywood 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
	One more factor may come work against Silver Charm. He has an  
annoying habit of doing just enough to win, which has backfired at 
times. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1997 Belmont Stakes, the failure to detect the  
hard-charging Touch Gold in time probably cost him the Triple 
Crown. Then in last year's Breeder's Cup Classic, Awesome Again 
rallied on the inside while jockey Gary Stevens had Silver Charm 
concentrating on Swain. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure Gary will figure something out,'' Baffert said.  
``Great horses find a way to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Donn is the debut race of the NTRA Champions series, 11  
televised races designed to showcase horse racing's older 
champions. The National Thoroughbred Racing Association set up the 
series as a way to increase the sport's visibility.

<HEADLINE> FDIC Reconsiders New Banking Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Faced with a torrent of criticism from  
citizens worried about privacy, at least one federal banking agency 
is ready to reconsider a new proposal for anti-money laundering 
rules. 
</P>
<P>
	And the nation's bankers have joined the chorus of people and  
groups urging federal regulators to withdraw the proposed rules, 
warning that they could make Americans lose confidence in the 
banking system and government. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to have to do something different. ... We can't  
leave it as is,'' Christie Sciacca, associate director of 
supervision at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Sciacca said the FDIC is considering a range of options, from  
loosening the proposed rules to dropping them altogether. 
</P>
<P>
	Proposed regulations dubbed ``Know Your Customer'' rules would  
require banks to verify their customers' identities, know where 
their money comes from, and determine their normal pattern of 
transactions. The current requirements for banks to report any 
``suspicious'' transactions to law enforcement authorities would be 
expanded. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal is designed to combat money laundering techniques  
used by drug traffickers and other criminals to hide illegal 
profits. Laundering includes the use of wire transfers and bank 
drafts as well as ``smurfing,'' the practice of breaking down 
transactions into smaller amounts that do not have to be reported 
under banking laws. 
</P>
<P>
	Privacy advocates and ordinary people have complained that the  
rules would transform every bank teller into a cop. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDIC, as a visible symbol of the federal government with a  
plaque in every bank branch, has borne the brunt of the protest in 
the form of thousands of e-mail messages and letters -- more than 
14,000 of them as of Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The flood of angry e-mail started in December as the 90-day  
public comment period opened for the proposal. It closes on March 
8. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Bankers Association, in a letter Thursday to the  
FDIC and other federal banking regulators, cited ``the widespread 
and growing negative perception'' of the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are very concerned about the prospect of having the public  
lose confidence in the banking industry, and in government 
institutions generally, if this proposal is not withdrawn,'' the 
bankers' group wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal ``increases regulatory burdens on banking  
institutions and raises serious privacy concerns on the part of 
bank customers,'' the bankers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, who calls the proposal ``Big Brother  
banking,'' has said he plans to propose next week legislation that 
would bar the federal regulators -- the FDIC, the Federal Reserve, 
the Comptroller of the Currency and the Office of Thrift 
Supervision -- from going through with it. 
</P>
<P>
	OTS spokesman William Fulwider and Fed spokesman Bob Moore  
declined comment on the matter Friday. Spokesmen for the 
Comptroller's office didn't immediately return telephone calls 
seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Regulators have taken pains to reassure consumers that their  
privacy would be protected under the changes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because of privacy concerns, it is the ... expectation that  
banks would obtain only that information that is necessary to 
comply with the rule, and would limit the use of this information 
to that purpose,'' the Comptroller's office, which regulates 
nationally chartered banks, said last month.

<HEADLINE> Russians Dominate Skating Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) -- Russian women picked up where the  
men left off by moving into the top three positions of their event 
after today's short program at the European Figure Skating 
Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Defending champion Maria Butyrskaya, Viktoria Volchkova and  
Julia Soldatova all did the eight required elements with ease. 
</P>
<P>
	Butyrskaya skated to a spirited version of ``St. James Infirmary  
Blues'' that enabled her to illustrate her maturity. 
</P>
<P>
	While Volchkova and Soldatova had slightly more difficult jumps,  
the 26-year-old Butyskaya was far ahead in the presentation marks, 
scoring all 5.8s and 5.9s from the nine judges. Soldatova, 17, and 
the 16-year-old Volchkova each received just one 5.8. 
</P>
<P>
	Volchkova is making her international debut in senior  
competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Soldatova was seventh in last year's Europeans but that wasn't  
good enough to keep her on the Russian Olympic team. 
</P>
<P>
	Laetitia Hubert of France and Tanja Szewczenko of Germany, two  
outside contenders for women's medals, withdrew before the short 
program. Hubert had a stomach ailment and Szewczenko a hip injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Later today, the ice dance ended with Angelika Krylova and Oleg  
Ovsiannikov in front, seeking this year's third consecutive Russian 
victory -- and 11th straight since 1997 -- at the Europeans. 
</P>
<P>
	The men could have probably brought a few others to add to their  
1-2-3 finish of Thursday when Alexei Yagudin used an 
emotionally-packed routine to defend his title. 
</P>
<P>
	He showed his feelings on the ice -- pumping his fists after he  
completed a quadruple jump and again when he finished his 
emotionally-charged program. 
</P>
<P>
	Then he did it again coming off the ice, falling to his knees in  
tribute to his coach, Tatiana Tarasova, gliding toward her with his 
arms outstretched. 
</P>
<P>
	In a winner-take-all free skating portion, Yagudin was secure  
while his Russian teammates and rivals for his title crumbled. 
</P>
<P>
	Yevgeny Plushenko, who beat him twice earlier this month, and  
Alexei Urmanov, making a comeback after an injury wiped out his 
chance to defend his 1997 European title, were second and third, 
giving the Russians a sweep of the men's medals.

<HEADLINE> Asians Cool on Own Single Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAVOS, Switzerland (AP) -- Despite concerns over fluctuating  
exchange rates, Asian government leaders are in no hurry to adopt a 
unified currency similar to Europe's new euro. 
</P>
<P>
	European leaders have signaled their desire for an Asian  
regional currency which would function as the third pillar of world 
currencies, alongside the dollar and euro, introduced earlier this 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	But Asian officials speaking at a gathering of business and  
political leaders in Davos, Switzerland, said the idea was at most 
a distant aspiration. 
</P>
<P>
	Eisuke Sakakibara, Japan's vice finance minister, said that  
using the yen as a regional currency for Asia is ``unrealistic'' at 
present. 
</P>
<P>
	Asia ``will continue to be dollar-denominated for some time to  
come,'' Sakakibara predicted. 
</P>
<P>
	Singapore's senior minister, Lee Kuan Yew, said he sees no  
prospect of a single Asian currency anytime soon because Asia's 
economies are too diverse. 
</P>
<P>
	``One currency is an aspiration more than a forecast,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Japan and several European countries called for closer  
coordination between the Group of Seven leading industrial nations 
to try to limit currency fluctuations. 
</P>
<P>
	Among them was French Finance Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn,  
who said there was a need for ``a new way to cooperate to avoid 
volatility'' now that the euro has been launched. U.S. officials 
opposed the call. 
</P>
<P>
	European Central Bank President Wim Duisenberg said he expects a  
``tripolar monetary world'' to develop, with the euro, yen and 
dollar playing key roles. He added that he expects some countries 
to peg their currencies to the euro. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien brushed off  
suggestions that his country might consider abandoning its currency 
for the U.S. dollar.

<HEADLINE> New Execution Set in Missouri </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP) -- A day after the governor commuted the  
sentence of triple murderer Darrell Mease following a personal plea 
from Pope John Paul II, another condemned killer learned Friday he 
would be the next person to be executed in Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that if you do it for one person, you should do it for  
all,'' James Edward Rodden said in a telephone interview from 
prison. ``I like Darrell, don't get me wrong and I'm happy for him, 
but I think I'm just as good a person.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Mel Carnahan commuted Mease's death sentence to life in  
prison without parole on Thursday after the pope made a 
face-to-face request on Mease's behalf during his visit to St. 
Louis. Mease was scheduled to die by injection on Feb. 10. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodden, 38, said he didn't expect the pope to come to his rescue  
before his execution, scheduled for Feb. 24. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe they are going to kill me,'' said Rodden, who has  
been on death row since 1985 for the Dec. 6, 1983, murder of Terry 
Trunnel. The Missouri Supreme Court declined to hear Rodden's 
latest appeal in November. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodden met Trunnel at a bar in Marshall, then took her back to  
an apartment he shared with Joseph Arnold. He stabbed both to 
death, according to court records. Rodden then tried to set the 
apartment on fire. He also received a life sentence for Arnold's 
death. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodden would be the 27th person executed in Missouri since  
Carnahan became governor in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked Thursday about the fairness of his decision with  
regard to other inmates, Carnahan said: ``I think they can expect 
to receive the punishment that was meted out by the court. Unless 
there are extenuating circumstances so that their trial was not 
fair or something of that nature.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rodden said Carnahan's decision was political.  
</P>
<P>
	``The death penalty has always been about politics,'' Rodden  
said. ``I believe he's going to run for Senate, and like any other 
politician, the death penalty is always an issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carnahan, a popular second-term Democrat who plans to challenge  
Republican Sen. John Ashcroft in 2000, said Thursday that he still 
supports the death penalty and that his decision was based on a 
personal request from the pope. 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Sifford, Carnahan's spokesman, reiterated the governor's  
position on death penalty cases and said Mease's commutation won't 
put any additional pressure on the governor in the Rodden case. 
</P>
<P>
	``There may be attempts to pressure the governor, but he doesn't  
feel any pressure to do anything differently,'' Sifford said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cardinal Angelo Sodano, the Vatican's secretary of state, said  
in an interview in Rome on Friday that the Vatican was not 
disappointed that the governor said he still favors capital 
punishment. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Larry Rice, a longtime death penalty opponent who has  
befriended Mease and praised Carnahan's decision, said the 
scheduling of Rodden's execution was cause for concern. 
</P>
<P>
	``It tells me that the death machine is still at work,'' Rice  
said.

<HEADLINE> Crude Products Up Venezuela News  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Crude oil futures and products advanced Friday on the New York  
Mercantile Exchange after Venezuela, the largest exporter of crude 
to the United States, said it would consider another round of oil 
cuts in a bid to boost prices. 
</P>
<P>
	On other markets, soybean futures continued their slide.  
</P>
<P>
	Crude jumped in late trading after Venezuela's new energy and  
mines minister, Ali Rodriguez, said his country was working with 
members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and 
other world oil producers on another round of concerted output 
cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	Oil prices have hovered near 12-year lows for months despite  
producers' efforts to prop them with output cutbacks totaling more 
than 3 million barrels a day. Analysts have said at least an 
additional 1 million barrels daily must be taken off the market to 
have a lasting effect on prices and have noted that many producers 
still are exceeding quotas. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodriguez said Venezuela should reach full compliance to cut  
525,000 barrels a day in February. 
</P>
<P>
	His statements were heartening to futures traders, who this week  
found solace in domestic industry reports showing sharp declines in 
refinery operations and smaller inventories of heating oil and 
unleaded gasoline as a result. The only negative to that news had 
been continued large crude inventories, and efforts by world oil 
producers to deal with that situation could have a solid effect on 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
	World oil prices have fallen sharply amid a glut that has been  
exacerbated by sharply lower demand from Asia, Russia and parts of 
Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude for March delivery rose 30 cents to $12.79 a barrel; March  
heating oil rose .61 cent to 33.42 cents a gallon; March unleaded 
gasoline rose 1.14 cents to 38.35 cents a gallon; March natural gas 
fell 8.5 cents to $1.775 for each 1,000 cubic feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans fell to new 11 1/2-year lows on the Chicago Board of Trade  
as beneficial rain fell in Brazilian growing regions, boosting 
expectations farmers there will harvest bumper crops after a 
near-ideal growing season. That would come at a time when economic 
troubles have sharply reduced U.S. export demand and amid 
expectations U.S. farmers this spring will plant more acres to 
soybeans than corn and wheat. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Warrant Issued for Livent Founders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- As promised, the Canadian co-founders of the  
company that produced the Broadway hits ``Ragtime'' and ``Phantom 
of the Opera'' defied an order to appear in court to face fraud 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal authorities issued warrants for their arrest in a case  
that's likely to require an extradition attempt. 
</P>
<P>
	Livent Inc. founders Garth Drabinsky and Myron Gottlieb failed  
to appear Thursday in U.S. District Court in New York to be 
arraigned on 16 counts of fraud and conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
	The charges stem from allegations that the two inflated earnings  
reports and arranged kickbacks worth $4.6 million between 1990 and 
1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, the Securities and Exchange Commission accused  
Drabinsky and Gottlieb in a lawsuit of siphoning off money for 
themselves by inflating invoices paid to vendors. 
</P>
<P>
	Since being charged Jan. 13, both Drabinsky and Gottlieb have  
been defiant in denouncing the investigation. Both men issued 
statements Wednesday from Toronto, where they live, saying that 
nothing short of an extradition process would get them to appear in 
a U.S. court. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an essentially Canadian matter involving Canadian  
citizens and, as a matter of convenience and justice, should 
properly be dealt with before Canadian courts,'' said Edward L. 
Greenspan, Drabinsky's lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal officials said they will seek to have the men  
extradited. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to ``Ragtime'' and ``Phantom,'' Livent has produced  
such lavish musicals ``Kiss of the Spider Woman'' and ``Showboat,'' 
as well as the play ``Barrymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The men founded the company 10 years ago.  
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys for both men declined to comment Thursday on the  
warrants, which are only valid if the defendants return to the 
United States or are extradited.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Cut Early Gains; Dow Off 6.95 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rose this morning, but retreated  
immediately as a decline in technology stocks offset a 
better-than-expected report showing continued strength in the U.S. 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
	At 10 a.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
up 6.95 at 9,288.28. The blue-chip index rose nearly 49 points in 
the first minutes of trading before pulling back. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were also lower.  
</P>
<P>
	A selloff in technology stocks pulled the market down today as  
investors cashed in on the big gains in many high-tech shares over 
the last few weeks. The technology-laden Nasdaq composite index is 
up nearly 13 percent this year, compared with only a 1 percent gain 
in the Dow. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft was down 1 1/2 at 172 1/2, Amazon.com was off 4 7/8 at 118 and  
Yahoo fell 15 1/4 at 352 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	Weakness in the tech area offset a strong economic report. The  
Commerce Department reported that the nation's gross domestic 
products -- the total of goods and services produced within U.S. 
borders -- rose 5.6 percent in the fourth quarter, ahead of 
economists' estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	For all of 1998, GDP increased by 3.9 percent, following an  
identical increase in 1997 and a healthy 3.4 percent rise in 1996. 
That made the three-year period the economy's most robust run of 
growth since 1984-86. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market right now is sending a lot of mixed signals,'' said  
Brian Belski, chief investment strategist at George K. Baum &AMP; Co. 
in Kansas City. ``Everyone is reading too much into everything and 
we aren't sure of our next step.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 3-to-2 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 113.93 million 
shares, up from Friday's early pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 2.04 at 1,263.33, and  
the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index was down 0.74 at 
2,476.60. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was down 0.11 at 595.29, and the  
American Stock Exchange composite index was down 3.15 at 710.78. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 1.09 percent. In  
afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was up 1.8 percent, 
Britain's FT-SE 100 was up 0.6 percent, and France's CAC-40 was up 
1.7 percent.

<HEADLINE> White House Hones Lewinsky Strategy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton's lawyers, who once sought  
to prove Monica Lewinsky might be fibbing, are likely to approach 
their first questioning of the former intern in more gingerly 
fashion. They hope to get her to repeat statements that are helpful 
to the president without challenging her credibility. 
</P>
<P>
	Along the way, they might also explore her treatment by  
prosecutors who were pressing hard for her cooperation, a subject 
that was ignored before the grand jury, according to advisers 
familiar with the White House's emerging strategy for Monday's 
videotaped deposition. 
</P>
<P>
	These advisers, inside and outside the White House, cautioned  
Friday that final decisions wouldn't be made until later this 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	They stressed the goal was to use their side's four hours of  
questioning of Ms. Lewinsky to embolden the 44 Senate Democrats who 
have already voted to dismiss the case and who hold the ability to 
acquit Clinton at the impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	House prosecutors are expected to zero in on details of the  
relationship in an effort to show the president's efforts to find 
Ms. Lewinsky a job were inextricably connected to her filing a 
false affidavit denying their affair and that the hiding of gifts 
he'd given her was part of a scheme by Clinton to obstruct justice. 
</P>
<P>
	In stark contrast, the White House legal team is likely to work  
the margins of Ms. Lewinsky's account, accentuating her most 
favorable past testimony. Chief among those statements was her 
assertion last August, ``No one ever asked me to lie and I was 
never promised a job for my silence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One adviser, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the goal  
would be to show that any cover stories Ms. Lewinsky and the 
president developed were aimed at hiding their relationship from 
the beginning -- ``like any two embarrassed adults'' -- and were not 
constructed later to obstruct justice. 
</P>
<P>
	The president's defenders have also discussed posing some  
questions about the threat of prosecution she and her parents were 
under as Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's office tried to compel 
her cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ms. Lewinsky was never asked by Mr. Starr's assistants in the  
grand jury about the kinds of coercive threats which were made 
against her and her family. And since she will be under oath she 
will be obliged to answer questions of that nature,'' said former 
Watergate prosecutor Richard Ben-Veniste, an outside adviser to the 
White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Ben-Veniste said Clinton's lawyers could use their questions to  
point out that when FBI agents and Starr's prosecutors confronted 
Ms. Lewinsky in a hotel on Jan. 16, 1998, and threatened her with 
perjury in the Paula Jones case, her lawyers hadn't yet filed with 
the court clerk the affidavit denying a sexual relationship with 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was absurd but I'm sure very real to her at the time,''  
Ben-Veniste said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two lawyers who have played a role in the president's defense at  
the trial, Deputy White House Counsel Cheryl Mills and private 
attorney Nicole Seligman, are preparing for the Lewinsky interview 
although it is unclear who will actually pose the questions for 
Clinton's side. 
</P>
<P>
	The president's supporters, mindful of the fact that Ms.  
Lewinsky would risk her protection from prosecution if she altered 
her account substantially, are taking pains to portray her in 
public as truthful and consistent. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a marked difference from a year ago when presidential  
lawyers sought out inconsistencies in her story, hoping to discover 
an innocent explanation for her 37 visits to the White House after 
she was no longer employed there. Other presidential supporters 
were dismissing her as a ``stalker.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see her as a hostile witness at all,'' said former  
presidential special counsel Lanny Davis, who continues to advise 
the White House. ``On 23 occasions she was questioned by Ken 
Starr's staff, anxious to bulldoze her, and I admire the fact that 
she has stuck to the truth throughout.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But while both Ms. Lewinsky and Clinton now admit to an affair,  
they disagree on aspects of their relationship that are key to the 
House prosecutors' obstruction and perjury cases. 
</P>
<P>
	The first is in the timing of their sexual intimacy. She says it  
began in November 1995 when she was still an intern; he says it 
began in early 1996, after she was a full-time employee. 
</P>
<P>
	White House lawyers are likely to avoid that sensitive issue in  
the deposition, and instead contend in their closing arguments that 
any conflicts are just innocent differences in recall, advisers 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	A second area involves presidential gifts that were picked up  
from her apartment by Clinton's secretary and then hidden under a 
bed even though they were under subpoena. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lewinsky version: Oval Office secretary Betty Currie picked  
up the gifts just hours after Ms. Lewinsky raised the idea with the 
president. Mrs. Currie says she believes Ms. Lewinsky instigated 
the pickup. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton lawyers could simply ask, What did the president tell  
you when you raised the idea of giving the gifts? ``I think he 
responded, 'I don't know' or 'Let me think about that,''' Ms. 
Lewinsky answered last summer, adding she never talked to the 
president again about it and only assumed Mrs. Currie had been sent 
by him.

<HEADLINE> Fla. Urges Newborn Blood Sampling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Rona Kay Cradit left the maternity  
ward with a baby boy, a wonderful keepsake set of his footprints 
and a sealed pouch with a stain of the infant's blood. 
</P>
<P>
	It may not fit the romantic picture of starting a new life, but  
Florida authorities are encouraging hospitals to offer parents a 
DNA sample from their newborns -- just in case the children are ever 
kidnapped, killed or otherwise need to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
	It is believed to be the first such program offered to newborns  
in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously it's something you don't want to think about,'' said  
Cradit, whose son, Mickey, had a few drops of blood taken from his 
heel moments after his birth. 
</P>
<P>
	``You just got this precious little life and you don't want to  
think about it being snatched away from you,'' she said. ``But from 
my perspective ... why not have it? It could help bring closure to 
an awful situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The newborn DNA program is a product of one of those unthinkable  
situations: the abduction, rape and dismemberment of 9-year-old 
Jimmy Ryce of Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	Traces of Jimmy's body were found at the home of ranch hand Juan  
Carlos Chavez, who was convicted last December in the boy's 
slaying. Authorities had to use DNA samples from Jimmy's parents 
and compare them to the traces of his body to get a positive 
identification. 
</P>
<P>
	DNA contains genetic information that makes each person unique.  
With the exception of identical twins, everyone's DNA is different, 
in the same way fingerprints differ. 
</P>
<P>
	The samples, currently available in at least eight Florida  
hospitals, cost about $1.40 per child for materials. Most 
facilities are offering the service for free. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea has been well received by new moms wherever it's been  
offered. 
</P>
<P>
	``Out of the initial 500 kids they had, only two (parents)  
turned them down,'' said Linda McDonald of the Florida Department 
of Law Enforcement, which help set up the program. 
</P>
<P>
	The sampling is done by pricking the baby in the heel, usually  
in the delivery room. A couple drops of blood are put on a piece of 
specially treated paper. That is then sealed into a bag and given 
to the parents. There are no other samples held by police or the 
hospital, McDonald said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cradit, who wrote the literature for the DNA pilot program at  
Tallahassee Memorial Hospital, says the blood stains are not meant 
to replace the tender footprints so many parents enjoy for 
keepsakes. 
</P>
<P>
	``But as far as really being a reliable means of identification,  
baby footprints probably aren't the best,'' Cradit said. ``If that 
was all you had to use to try to make an ID on a child that was 10 
years old, it won't be real good.''

<HEADLINE> Diana Crash Investigation Concludes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- After 17 months, the investigation into Princess  
Diana's death has ended, Paris prosecutors announced today. But any 
conclusions likely won't be known for months. 
</P>
<P>
	All of the parties in the case now will have 20 days to request  
any further tests or questioning. 
</P>
<P>
	After that, the judge heading the investigation will make his  
conclusions known to prosecutors, who will have three months to 
decide what action to recommend, if any. Judge Herve Stephan has 
the final say on such action. Any trial resulting from the case 
probably wouldn't come until late this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The news came just hours after Stephan again interviewed the  
photographers implicated in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Diana, her boyfriend Dodi Fayed and their driver, Henri Paul,  
were killed in an Aug. 31, 1997 car crash in a Paris traffic 
tunnel. Paul was drunk at the time, and that is still believed to 
be the main cause of the crash, along with speed. 
</P>
<P>
	But the fate of nine photographers and a press motorcyclist who  
were tailing the Mercedes that night has yet to be resolved. 
</P>
<P>
	They have been placed under formal investigation -- one step  
short of being formally charged -- for manslaughter and failing to 
aid people in danger. 
</P>
<P>
	Many observers believe the manslaughter charges will be dropped,  
but a few photographers are expected to be formally charged and 
tried on the second, lesser charge. 
</P>
<P>
	Another question is the possible liability of the Etoile  
Limousine company, which rented the Mercedes to the Ritz Hotel, and 
of the hotel itself, where driver Paul was an employee. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ritz is the sole client of Etoile, and bodyguard Trevor  
Rees-Jones -- the sole survivor of the crash -- has accused both of 
failing to protect him and the other occupants of the Mercedes. 
</P>
<P>
	One major disappointment in the investigation was the inability  
of police to track down the Fiat Uno believed to have brushed 
against the Mercedes just before it crashed. It isn't known to what 
extent that brush caused the crash. 
</P>
<P>
	Stephan interviewed at least five photographers today at the  
Palais de Justice, the main courthouse in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers said the questioning focused on recent revelations that  
one photographer, Fabrice Chasserie, had phone contact three times 
on the day of the crash with the owner of Etoile Limousine. 
</P>
<P>
	Such contact suggests the photographer had advance knowledge of  
the route the Mercedes would take. The judge wanted to know if 
other photographers had that information as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense lawyer William Bourdon, who represents photographer  
Nikolas Arsov, said he will ask the judge to dismiss the case 
against his client. 
</P>
<P>
	The parties now will have 20 days to make their requests. That  
includes the civil parties to the case, among them Mohamed Al 
Fayed, father of Dodi and owner of the Ritz; Diana's mother, 
Frances Shand-Kydd; the parents of Henri Paul, and bodyguard Trevor 
Rees-Jones, the sole survivor of the crash. 
</P>
<P>
	The parties could also appeal any decisions Stephan makes on  
their requests, further dragging out the proceedings.

<HEADLINE> Stocks End Higher; Dow Up 77.50 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks posted strong gains today after  
recovering from a wobbly morning, as technology shares bounced 
backed from their lows and investors refocused on a morning report 
showing continued strength in the U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
	At the close of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial  
average was up 77.50 points at 9,358.83. The blue-chip index rose 
49 points in the first minutes of trading, then dropped to negative 
57 points before recovering. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the gain in the Dow, advancing issues were barely  
leading decliners on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume was 
moderately heavy but up from Thursday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were mostly higher after an early  
morning selloff. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 rose 13.98 to 1,279.35, and the Nasdaq  
composite index rose 28.34 to 2,505.68. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by 1,386 to 1,377 on the  
New York Stock Exchange, with 600 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	NYSE volume totaled 906.93 million shares as of 4 p.m., vs.  
846.62 million in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index rose 5.04 to 600.44, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index rose 0.93 to 714.86. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 3.24 to 427.21.  
</P>
<P>
	Stocks opened higher as investors cheered the Commerce  
Department's report showing a better-than-expected 5.6 percent rise 
in fourth-quarter gross domestic product. 
</P>
<P>
	For all of 1998, GDP -- the total of goods and services produced  
within the United States -- increased by 3.9 percent, following an 
identical increase in 1997 and a healthy 3.4 percent rise in 1996. 
That made the three-year period the economy's most robust run of 
growth since 1984-86. 
</P>
<P>
	But the market's gains quickly disappeared with the release of a  
report from the Purchasing Management Association of Chicago that 
showed manufacturing declined in the Midwest in January. 
</P>
<P>
	Also pressuring stocks early today was a slump in technology  
shares, which fell on profit taking. 
</P>
<P>
	By midday, however, the buyers were back in the market looking  
for deals on technology stocks, and attention was again focused on 
the positive GDP report. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market right now is sending a lot of mixed signals,'' said  
Brian Belski, chief investment strategist at George K. Baum &AMP; Co. 
in Kansas City. ``Everyone is reading too much into everything and 
we aren't sure of our next step.''

<HEADLINE> CSX Settles Discrimination Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- CSX Transportation Inc., the nation's  
third-largest railroad company, has settled a class-action lawsuit 
claiming race discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge U.W. Clemon in Birmingham, Ala., who had  
approved the settlement Dec. 17, today overruled an objection to 
the agreement by a former employee, said Shirley Brown, the judge's 
docket clerk. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms of the settlement, which affects thousands of black union  
employees in operating crafts, were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	The employees' suit filed in 1994 accused Jacksonville-based CSX  
Transportation of discriminating against black workers in areas of 
employment policies, practices and procedures. 
</P>
<P>
	CSX spokesman Kathy Burns said Friday that the parties agreed  
not to disclose terms of the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	``The settlement is not a reflection of the merits of the  
case,'' Ms. Burns said, adding it was settled to avoid the costs of 
litigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We at CSX Transportation have zero tolerance for any form of  
discrimination,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to 12 individual plaintiffs and two unions who  
brought the complaint, the lawsuit represented black union 
employees in transportation, engineering and mechanical areas, and 
who had been employed by the company since June 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	CSX Transportation is a holding of CSX Corp., which is based in  
Richmond, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, the judge overruled an objection filed by James Davis  
of Fitzgerald, Ga., a former employee who reached a disability 
settlement with CSX Transportation in 1996. Davis said he filed his 
objection because he does not think the settlement goes far enough.

<HEADLINE> Inflation Fears in Brazil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- With inflation threatening a return  
performance, housewife Dora Inui isn't taking any chances. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of the one bag of beans she used to purchase in her  
weekly trips to a large Sao Paulo supermarket, she decides to throw 
six into the shopping cart ``before prices go up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ghost of inflation, long the scourge of Latin America's  
largest economy, is once again haunting Brazilians. 
</P>
<P>
	And the retail sector, led by supermarkets, has emerged as the  
exorcist, promising to drive away suppliers who want to raise their 
prices. Instead, retailers are pressing suppliers to prove higher 
prices are justified and demanding that any increased costs be 
negotiated. 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks ago, Brazil abruptly devalued its currency, the real,  
spelling the end of a 1994 economic stabilization program that 
successfully brought inflation down from nearly 3,000 percent a 
year to about 2 percent in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The real has since fallen by about 40 percent and  
pre-devaluation estimates that placed inflation at close to zero by 
the end of 1999 have now been revised to at least 10 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Although store prices still remain relatively stable, largely  
due to supplies purchased before the devaluation, retailers have 
moved quickly to prevent the return of the bad old days when price 
stickers were changed almost daily. 
</P>
<P>
	Back then, when monthly double-digit inflation figures were the  
rule, consumers would rush to supermarkets on payday and stock up 
on enough goods to last them a month. 
</P>
<P>
	``It used to be terrible,'' said Custodia Maria Rocha Oliveira,  
a proofreader at a publishing house. ``Our purchasing power would 
start withering away almost as soon as we received our wages.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Suppliers of a wide range of products, including flour, poultry,  
coffee, plastics and household appliances have used the devaluation 
to justify planned price hikes. 
</P>
<P>
	Many claim that as the buying power of the real sinks on world  
markets, pushing up prices for imported raw materials and 
components, they have been forced to increase consumer prices by as 
much as 30 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogerio Amato, a director of Eletros, an association of electric  
appliance manufacturers, said price increases in his sector were 
unavoidable because imported components account for 50 percent of 
production costs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are going to have to raise our prices,'' he said. 'There's  
no other way out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The devaluation, which makes it easier for Brazilian goods to  
compete on the basis of price in other countries, has also 
encouraged exports, something that could hurt Brazilian consumers. 
For example, coffee, poultry and orange juice producers are 
earmarking large parts of their production for the export market. 
</P>
<P>
	``This could result in shortages, which spells higher prices for  
the Brazilian consumer,'' said Pierre Brisset, research director of 
the French-owned Carrefour supermarket chain, Brazil's largest. 
</P>
<P>
	``The devaluation will inevitably lead to higher prices,'' he  
added. ``But many suppliers have presented us with new prices which 
are simply abusive, unacceptable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By abusive, he said he meant any ``double-digit increase.''  
</P>
<P>
	``Suppliers who increase their prices by more than 10 percent  
will have to justify themselves and show us their spreadsheets,'' 
Brisset said. ``If not, we will look for alternatives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pao de Acucar, Brazil's second-largest supermarket chain, has  
adopted the same stance. 
</P>
<P>
	``The retail sector has to be like a dike that is used to  
carefully control how much water can pass,'' said Pao de Acucar's 
commercial director Valdemar Machado. ``We will only buy from 
suppliers who negotiate and propose reasonable price increases.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Brazilian consumer, who enjoyed price stability during the  
Real Plan, will also help keep the lid on inflation, Brisset said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Consumers will no longer passively accept exorbitant price  
hikes,'' he said. ``They are more willing to do without certain 
items and brand loyalty has been replaced by price loyalty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Conceicao Aparecida dos Santos, a secretary in a law firm,  
agrees. 
</P>
<P>
	``Prices continue the same,'' she said as she reaches for a  
package of her favorite spaghetti. ``But if they go up I'll look 
for another cheaper brand. I have to worry about my pocketbook, not 
their's.''

<HEADLINE> Trademark Flap Over Dirty Bird </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Alan Weiss insists he was a Dirty Bird when the  
Dirty Birds weren't cool. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1995, Weiss says he has been hanging a black banner  
proclaiming the Georgia Dome end zone, where he has front-row 
season tickets the ``Dirty Bird Zone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He got a trademark from the state and started selling T-shirts  
with the slogan back in 1995, when the Falcons were not-so-lovable 
losers. 
</P>
<P>
	Not surprisingly, the shirts were only a modest success.  
However, now that the Falcons have popularized the dance during 
their improbable march to the Super Bowl, half of Atlanta seems to 
be wearing Dirty Bird merchandise. Kids are doing the dance and 
radio stations are playing several Dirty Bird songs. 
</P>
<P>
	And the NFL has told Weiss to bury his Dirty Bird merchandise.  
The league claims it owns the trademark. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our view is that as soon as a slogan is created that is  
associated with the team, it is our property,'' says Gary Gertzog, 
senior vice president of business affairs and general counsel for 
the NFL. ``The ability to capitalize on that market is associated 
with the Falcons and not any individual.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Weiss, 30, said his idea hatched when he and a 49ers fan were  
arguing about their teams. The friend called Weiss a dirty bird, 
and he liked it. The next game, he brought the banner. 
</P>
<P>
	Weiss says other longtime Falcons fans who had seats in the same  
area persuaded him to make T-shirts. Weiss then registered the 
trademark ``Dirty Bird'' with Georgia and started selling shirts. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was never an Atlanta Falcons reference on it, but it was  
associated with them,'' said Weiss' lawyer Jon Marigliano. 
</P>
<P>
	Weiss says for the past four years, the Falcons organization  
referred fans to him when they called asking about Dirty Bird 
merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
	Then the unexpected happened -- the Falcons started winning. And  
every time the players scored they saw Weiss' Dirty Bird banner, 
Marigliano says. 
</P>
<P>
	``They picked it up and the rest is history,'' he says.  
</P>
<P>
	Running back Jamal Anderson and tight end O.J. Santiago  
introduced the wing-flapping end-zone dance. 
</P>
<P>
	Weiss licensed the trademark to distributors and manufacturers.  
His merchandise was in more than 800 Atlanta locations, and he sold 
almost $600,000 in Dirty Bird products. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Falcons upset Minnesota in the NFC championship two  
weeks ago, Weiss thought sales would really take off. 
</P>
<P>
	But then NFL Properties contacted some of Weiss' retailers and  
told them the league owned the Dirty Bird license. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL had purchased a federal Dirty Bird trademark from the  
leader of a motorcycle gang in Nebraska who had registered it in 
Dec. 5, 1995, before Weiss' registered the trademark in Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
	``We felt we were on solid ground because the Dirty Birds had  
been used and associated with Falcons from the outset of its 
popularity,'' Gertzog said. But, he added, ``We wanted to eliminate 
any uncertainty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``That was kind of shocking,'' Weiss said. ``It really caught  
all of us off guard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Weiss' manufacturers have stopped making the Dirty Bird T-shirts  
because they are afraid of legal action by the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	His lawyers wrote to the NFL, asking them to stop disseminating  
their Dirty Bird merchandise. Weiss doesn't expect that tactic to 
work, so he's considering a lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to try to defend my mark,'' Weiss says.

<HEADLINE> Life Sentence in Va. Killing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDEPENDENCE, Va. (AP) -- After being given a life sentence  
Friday for his role in the death of a black man who was burned 
alive and beheaded, a white laborer apologized to the man's family 
but refused to accept blame. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am factually innocent,'' said Emmett Cressell, 38, who was  
convicted in November of first-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Cressell said he had been falsely accused by his co-defendant,  
Louis Ceparano, who struck a deal with prosecutors to avoid the 
death penalty. Ceparano also was sentenced to life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Cressell apologized to the family of Garnett P. Johnson for the  
anguish they have suffered since the July 1997 slaying, but didn't 
accept blame for it before Circuit Judge Colin Campbell imposed the 
sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	The life sentence, plus a $100,000 fine, had been recommended by  
the jury. There is no possibility of parole except for ``geriatric 
parole'' after he turns 60. 
</P>
<P>
	The sentence was the maximum that could have been imposed,  
because the jury opted to convict him of first-degree murder rather 
than capital murder, which could have carried the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson was doused with gasoline and set afire after an  
all-night drinking party at Ceparano's trailer in rural Grayson 
County. Authorities found Johnson's charred corpse in a pile of 
debris with his severed, burned head in a freshly dug hole nearby. 
</P>
<P>
	Ceparano and Cressell are white, and the slaying outraged black  
leaders across the country and prompted a Justice Department 
investigation into whether the slaying was a racially motivated 
hate crime. 
</P>
<P>
	The department said it would review the case after the  
prosecutions are completed. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Johnson, a cousin of the victim, said: ``This is the end of  
a chapter and maybe Grayson County can go back to being normal.''

<HEADLINE> Woman Freed Under Relaxed Lifer Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Finally free after 21 years in prison, a woman  
released Friday under a law relaxing sentences for drug crimes 
spent the day getting reacquainted with everyday life. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first thing I did was hug my niece and eat some ice  
cream,'' JeDonna Young said Friday. ``I'm tripping out just 
answering the telephone, making myself a sandwich, using the 
microwave.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Young, 44, left the Scott Regional Correctional Facility in  
suburban Plymouth one week after the state parole board unanimously 
agreed to release her. 
</P>
<P>
	She was driving with her boyfriend James Gulley in 1978 when  
Detroit police stopped her car and found nearly 3 pounds of heroin. 
Gulley said it was his; Ms. Young said she didn't know it was 
there. Both were convicted under a new, unforgiving anti-drug law 
that mandated life in prison. Gulley died in prison in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reluctantly upheld Ms. Young's  
conviction in 1989 but said it was unconvinced she was the kind of 
drug dealer the law was designed for. It suggested ``the tiger trap 
may have sprung upon a sick kitten.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the Legislature amended the lifer law to allow parole  
after 20 years, or as early as 15 years if the convict cooperated 
with police and did not have prior felony convictions. The change 
took effect Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Young said she doesn't harbor any resentment toward the  
system that imprisoned her for two decades. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have time for that. I have to move on,'' she said.  
``It's not going to be easy, but it's going to be OK.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Young said she plans to live with her mother in Detroit,  
perhaps working at a law firm. She had worked as a paralegal in 
prison and earned a college degree. 
</P>
<P>
	She also plans to make up lost time with her son, Deloneo -- who  
was just 7 years old when she went to prison. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to take each day very, very slowly,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> GeoCities Hosts Cyber-Homesteaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- GeoCities is a place for cyber-homesteaders, a  
service used by more than 3 million people to set up personal sites 
to tell the world about themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the fifth most visited Web destination in December,  
according to the rating firm Media Metrix, with almost 19 million 
visitors. America Online's sites were first with about 31 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Users can register for free, and get designing tools and help in  
constructing their own customized home pages. There is no cost for 
the basic pages, which are supported by advertising, but the 
company offers premium services without the ads. 
</P>
<P>
	For a fee, users with an entrepreneurial spirit can set up  
online stores and ``virtual'' offices where they can exchange 
files, chat with colleagues and collaborate on projects online. 
</P>
<P>
	Building a home page is simple: Users enter personal  
information, their areas of interests and which ``neighborhood'' 
they want to be a part of. There are 41 neighborhoods, including 
``SoHo,'' for the artsy, bohemian crowd, ``TelevisionCity'' for 
fans of television, and ``BourbonStreet,'' for fans of jazz and 
southern culture. 
</P>
<P>
	After that, users decide what goes on a page, whether it's  
pictures, text or sounds. All of this happens in their Web 
browser's window, so there's no software to download, unless 
sophisticated editing of the pages is required. 
</P>
<P>
	The company says Web pages grouped around different subjects  
form ``virtual communities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If you listen to the executives at Yahoo!, that's what really  
impressed them,'' said Bruce Zanca, GeoCities spokesman. ``The 
brand loyalty was one of the most attractive things about the 
company, the 'stickiness' of the sites.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Stickiness'' is a term used as a measure of how long people  
linger at a Web site. News sites, for instance, have high 
stickiness because readers spend a great deal of time there. 
``Portal'' sites including Yahoo!, are often visited for no more 
than the time it takes to find something like a stock price, the 
weather or some news. A site with high ``stickiness'' is very 
attractive to advertisers. 
</P>
<P>
	But some critics say these ``communities'' don't necessarily  
result in ``stickiness,'' and GeoCities is nothing more than a 
means of delivering people to advertisers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not particularly persuaded that there is such a thing as a  
virtual community,'' said John Perry Barlow, a prolific author 
about the Internet.

<P>
	Rain and snow fell on opposite ends of Texas Friday with more  
rain in the Southeast and snow in the Southwest. 
</P>
<P>
	Rain fell from areas of central Oklahoma and Texas east into  
Louisiana, Mississippi and Tennessee. Heavy rainfall prompted 
several flood warnings to be issued. Houston County, Texas had at 
least 6 inches of rain and thunderstorms were reported in central 
and eastern Texas. Some areas of central and eastern Texas were 
under tornado, flood or severe thunderstorm warnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Northwestern Louisiana had flash flooding, prompting hundreds of  
people to leave their homes. Some areas had 9 inches of rain and 
roads were covered with water. 
</P>
<P>
	North and west of the rain, a wintry mix of precipitation fell  
from Kansas into eastern New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	Freezing rain and sleet fell on southwestern Kansas and extreme  
western Oklahoma. Snow fell to west of this region over eastern 
sections of New Mexico and southern parts of Colorado and West 
Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	The storm dumped at least 6 inches of snow in parts of New  
Mexico, causing slick roads that to school closings. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of West Texas was covered with a blanket of snow, with some  
areas receiving 6 inches and more on the way. 
</P>
<P>
	An area of high pressure off the Southeast coast kept areas from  
the mid-Atlantic states into Florida mostly clear and pleasant. 
Conditions were warm and humid, with fog occurring along the Gulf 
Coast from the Florida Panhandle into northern Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
	Several large areas of high pressure kept the western Great  
Lakes, the northern Plains and the Rocky Mountain states dry. Skies 
were cloudy in the western parts of the Great Lakes, but conditions 
were clear to partly cloudy from the Dakotas to the desert 
Southwest. 
</P>
<P>
	A slow-moving cold front in the Pacific Northwest continued to  
bring rain and snow to Washington and Oregon. The lower elevations 
reported rain and several flood warnings were in effect due to high 
creeks and streams. Elevations above 3,500 feet in the Cascades got 
heavy snow. 
</P>
<P>
	By midafternoon, temperatures around the continental United  
States ranged from 84 in Kingsville, Texas to 26 below zero in 
Clayton Lake, Maine. The highest wind gust was 63 mph in Livingston 
Mont.

<HEADLINE> Entertaining Super Bowl Week Ending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- NFL coaches rarely pass for standup comics,  
particularly at the Super Bowl. Yet Mike Shanahan and Dan Reeves 
were in a jovial mood Friday as they wrapped up a week of 
entertaining buildup to Sunday's title game. 
</P>
<P>
	Granted, most of the entertainment was provided by the Broncos'  
Shannon Sharpe and the Falcons' Ray Buchanan. But Shanahan put 
their dissing match into perspective: 
</P>
<P>
	``If you take Shannon Sharpe out of the equation, we have been  
very quiet,'' said Shanahan, whose defending champions are 
seven-point favorites to become the first AFC repeater since the 
1980 game. ``Now if we didn't have Shannon Sharpe, there would be 
everybody in this room complaining about there was nothing exciting 
to write about or talk about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves talked about long-gone days when he was playing for  
championships. 
</P>
<P>
	``I watched the Ice Bowl game the other day or the other night,  
actually,'' Reeves said, referring to the NFL title game in 1967, 
played in subzero temperatures at Green Bay. ``I couldn't sleep. 
Those stories have gotten so much better through the years. I am a 
much better player than I was back in 1965. So it's amazing to hear 
some of the stories.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Commissioner Paul Tagliabue wasn't telling story, but he had  
plenty to talk about shortly after the coaches finished their 
monologues. 
</P>
<P>
	He discussed the likelihood of instant replay returning to help  
officials -- he almost guaranteed its passage at the March league 
meetings -- and endorsed Lawrence Taylor for the Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	``We, a lot of people in the National Football League, by  
jumping on the officials ... we got into shooting ourselves in the 
foot deals,'' he said, noting that, in general, the quality of 
officiating ``is as good as it's ever been. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we will have replay when we come out of the league  
meeting in March.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also said he believes Taylor, eligible for the Hall of Fame  
for the first time, will make it. There has been considerable 
debate about whether Taylor's off-field problems will derail his 
entry in Saturday's voting. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he should,'' be in the Hall, Tagliabue said. ``And I  
say that without qualification.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Broncos and the Falcons, meantime, held their final  
practices. Reeves placed Dave Widell, Rod Monroe, Omar Brown and 
Darren Anderson on the inactive list. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's one of the things I struggled the most with,'' Reeves  
said. ``I can't understand why you can't at least have them dress 
out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not dressing for Denver will be Justin Armour, Chris Banks,  
Cyron Brown and Trey Teague. 
</P>
<P>
	They weren't required to do interviews, so Sharpe and Buchanan  
couldn't insult each other again through the media. 
</P>
<P>
	Their trashathon almost overshadowed some other topics,  
including the feud involving Reeves and John Elway and Shanahan; 
the likelihood this will be John Elway's last game; and the novelty 
of having the Falcons in their first Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves, of course, has been in more of these games than anyone.  
This will be his ninth, but he's lost all three as a coach -- with 
the Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think there is any question that it would be more  
gratifying (to win) as a coach,'' said Reeves, who has overseen a 
remarkable Atlanta turnaround from 3-13 in 1996, the year before he 
arrived, to 16-2 this season. ``Now maybe I wouldn't say that if I 
had won my first one, because I can remember how gratifying it was 
to win that first Super Bowl after struggling and being there so 
closely (with Dallas). 
</P>
<P>
	``But I think when you go through and have lost three and you  
feel like you let everybody down, because that is your 
responsibility as head coach ... it would mean more as a coach than 
it did when I was a player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shanahan was on Reeves' Denver staff for those super flops in  
the 1987, '89 and '90 games. Now, he's dealing with history. 
</P>
<P>
	Before last year's win over the Packers, no AFC team had even  
won a league title since the 1983 season. Beating Atlanta would 
stamp these Broncos as one of the NFL's best. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought our guys stepped up and wanted to make themselves  
special this year by going out and proving that last year wasn't a 
fluke,'' Shanahan said. ``Character, that is where it starts, in 
everything we do.''

<HEADLINE> Report: Sony To Sell Music on Web </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's Sony Music Entertainment plans to start  
allowing Internet users to download music for a fee and record it 
onto minidiscs, according to a published report Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Customers would be able to choose from music produced by Sony,  
and would be charged according to the number of songs downloaded or 
the playing time of the music, the Asahi newspaper reported. The 
newspaper did not say when the new program would be implemented. 
</P>
<P>
	The company declined to confirm the report.  
</P>
<P>
	Sony Music Entertainment's parent company, Sony Corp., has been  
aggressively pursuing new recording technologies including the 
minidisc. 
</P>
<P>
	Earnings at Sony's music division increased 22 percent in the  
three months ended Dec. 31 even as the Sony group's overall profits

<HEADLINE> Highlights of Senate Roll Call Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Highlights of the Senate's three roll call votes in Thursday's  
Senate impeachment trial of President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	First, the Senate rejected, on a 54-44 vote, a Democratic  
proposal to limit to writing all records of the depositions of 
witnesses. The failed effort would have prevented videotaped 
depositions sought by the House Republican prosecutors and opposed 
by the White House. All 44 votes for the proposal were cast by 
Democrats, all 54 against it were cast by Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, the Senate rejected, on a 55-43 vote, a Democratic motion  
to go immediately to four final hours of debate in the trial and 
then vote on the two articles of impeachment accusing Clinton of 
perjury and obstruction of justice. All 43 votes for the move were 
cast by Democrats. Voting against it were 54 Republicans and one 
Democrat, Sen. Russell Feingold of Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, Republicans pushed through, on a 54-44 vote, their  
rules for the final phase of the impeachment trail. The rules 
permit videotaping of the questioning but leaves until later a 
decision whether to release to the public the transcripts and 
videotapes of the depositions. All 54 yes votes were cast by 
Republicans and all 44 no votes were cast by Democrats.

accepted a $1.5 million payoff for services rendered during the 
Barcelona Games. 
</P>
<P>
	While Spanish sports authorities defended the financial running  
of the 1992 Games, the daily newspaper El Mundo said Friday that 
Manuel Romero received the money from the now-defunct PESA 
electronics firm, which had been contracted to supply audiovisual 
equipment for the Barcelona Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	The chief organizer of the 1992 games, Josep Miquel Abad, said  
PESA won the tender to supply the equipment because it was the 
cheapest option. 
</P>
<P>
	Abad made no reference to the El Mundo report or Romero.  
</P>
<P>
	Barcelona Mayor Josep Clos also issued a statement saying  
accounts for the 1992 Games were without blemish and open to the 
public. 
</P>
<P>
	Nobody at the Spanish Olympic Committee was available for  
comment on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	According to El Mundo, Romero lives in Atlanta, where he runs a  
firm called Sports Broadcasting. The paper said he has been a 
leading figure within Olympic Radio and Television and has been 
responsible for the televising of the past three Summer Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The Barcelona-based daily El Periodico de Catalunya quoted  
Romero as saying that he had no connection with PESA but admitted 
receiving the $1.5 million from Panasonic for unspecified services. 
</P>
<P>
	Panasonic was the official telecommunications sponsor of the  
Barcelona Games. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement issued Friday from Vail, Colo., where he is  
attending the World Alpine Skiing championships, Romero said the 
reports were based on ``unsubstantiated allegations from a Spanish 
court proceeding that is in no way related to the Olympics and in 
which I am only peripherally involved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he had ``no business relationship with PESA.''  
</P>
<P>
	``I am confident that when all the facts are known I will be  
fully vindicated,'' Romero said. 
</P>
<P>
	El Mundo said the alleged payment came to light in a judicial  
investigation following the collapse of PESA in 1994. Probing 
forged invoices from Panasonic, the paper said investigators traced 
the payment to a Swiss bank account belonging to Romero.

<HEADLINE> Former Hoyas Player Sentenced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Former Georgetown basketball player Kevin  
Millen was sentenced to two years' probation Friday for stalking 
former coach John Thompson and unlawful entry on the campus. 
</P>
<P>
	D.C. Superior Court Judge Anita Josey-Herring released Millen,  
25, on the condition that he return to his home in Memphis, Tenn., 
and stay away from Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Millen, who pleaded guilty to the charges Thursday in an  
agreement with prosecutors, also cannot have any contact with 
anyone from Georgetown and must undergo counseling. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has some health issues that absolutely must be addressed in  
order to keep him from being further involved in the court 
system,'' Josey-Herring said of Millen, who could have received up 
to 18 months imprisonment. 
</P>
<P>
	Millen was charged in November after he was caught on campus in  
defiance of a court order and after he made more than 30 
threatening phone calls to the university's athletic office last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors had asked the judge to sentence Millen to three  
years probation, but U.S. Attorney Robert Bowman said he was 
satisfied with the judge's decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to encourage Mr. Millen to control his behavior and  
get on with his life,'' Bowman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Millen declined to comment at the sentencing hearing, except to  
ask the judge questions about his release from jail. He smiled 
broadly when he was told he could be released right away. 
</P>
<P>
	Millen played for Georgetown from 1991-95.

<HEADLINE> Paper: Angelos Wants Clinton's Help </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Although the Baltimore Orioles owner Peter  
Angelos asked for President Clinton's help in arranging a series 
with a Cuban team, he doesn't want the White House dictating how 
the game's proceeds are spent. 
</P>
<P>
	Angelos is scheduled to meet this afternoon with Samuel Berger,  
the President's national security advisor, The (Baltimore) Sun 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Angelos returned from Havana last week without an agreement from  
the Cuban government to have the Orioles and the Cuban team play 
one exhibition game in Baltimore and one in Havana. 
</P>
<P>
	In allowing the Orioles to meet with Cuban officials, the  
Clinton administration added the condition that proceeds from the 
games could only benefit the Cuban people and not Fidel Castro's 
regime. 
</P>
<P>
	But Angelos said Thursday that the Cubans are entitled to  
profits from the Havana game, though the proceeds from the 
Baltimore game would belong the the Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
	`We're willing to contribute to a worthwhile cause, subject to  
the approval of our government,'' Angelos said. 
</P>
<P>
	Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said Caritas, the Catholic  
Church's international aid organization, should distribute the 
game's proceeds to help the Cuban people. 
</P>
<P>
	Angelos, however, said there was never any requirement that the  
funds go to a particular group. He said the Clinton administration 
should make that clear. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said ``there (was no) insistence or intention by the  
Cubans that any proceeds be distributed to the Cuban government or 
(Cuban) governmental agency.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Profits from televising the games are not expected to even reach  
$200,000, said Baltimore attorney Rick Schaeffer, who has been 
involved in the arrangement of the games. 
</P>
<P>
	The games are tentatively set for March 28 in Havana and April 3  
in Baltimore.

<HEADLINE> Groups Vow To Expand Intel Boycott </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Privacy groups refuse to drop their boycott  
against Intel Corp. over new technology in its new Pentium III 
computer chips that helps identify consumers as they move across 
the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the groups urged Intel at a meeting Thursday to recall  
its chips already in production. They also promised to expand their 
boycott to include any computer makers that sell machines using the 
Pentium III, which is expected on the market within weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel will not consider recalling Pentium chips already sent to  
computer manufacturers, company spokesman Chuck Mulloy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at Compaq Computer Corp. and Dell Computer Corp.,  
among the nation's largest computer makers, could not be reached 
immediately to respond. 
</P>
<P>
	``The distributors of a privacy toxin are as liable as the  
manufacturers of a privacy toxin,'' said Jason Catlett, president 
of Junkbusters Corp. of Green Brook, N.J., which helped organize 
the boycott with the Washington-based Electronic Privacy 
Information Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel would not comment on the demands ``other than to say we've  
briefed them,'' Mulloy said. The chips are ``in the hands of the 
(computer makers), and systems are being built.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The effects of any boycott on Intel would be negligible. The  
company supplies roughly 85 percent of the world's computer 
processors and had $26.2 billion in sales last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The groups disclosed that attorneys general in some states,  
including New York and Massachusetts, contacted them this week 
about the privacy issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel, the world's largest computer chip-maker, unveiled new  
technology last week in its newest Pentium chip that can transmit 
its unique serial number internally and to Web sites that requested 
it to help verify users. The company said the technology will help 
online merchants eliminate fraud by verifying a consumer's 
identity. 
</P>
<P>
	But facing criticism over privacy issues, Intel promised Monday  
to offer free software to let consumers permanently disconnect the 
feature. It also pledged to use the software to turn off the 
technology by default in future copies of the chips that have not 
been distributed to the world's computer makers. 
</P>
<P>
	The privacy groups told two Intel executives in Washington that  
the software solution was inadequate because Intel would not 
require computer makers to turn the technology off by default. They 
complained the software too easily was fooled into reactivating the 
technology without warning. 
</P>
<P>
	They said they want Intel to change its manufacturing process --  
an immensely expensive proposition -- to change all future chips to 
transmit ``0'' as their serial number, effectively rendering the 
technology useless.

<HEADLINE> Online Investors Complain to SEC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With millions of ordinary investors flocking  
to Internet trading at a time when wild price swings and massive 
volume are common, some glitches in the online network seem 
inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
	The recent gyrations, especially in hot Internet stocks, have  
caused both the National Association of Securities Dealers, which 
operates the Nasdaq Stock Market, and SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt to 
warn investors this week to exercise caution trading online. 
</P>
<P>
	As the trading temperature has risen, so have investors'  
complaints to the Securities and Exchange Commission: They jumped 
to around 1,100 in the year ended Sept. 30 from about 250 the 
previous year, according to the market watchdog agency. 
</P>
<P>
	That may be just the tip of the iceberg, with an estimated 10  
million people expected to be trading over the Internet by year's 
end. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really a rare person who complains,'' Nancy Smith,  
director of the SEC's office of investor education, said in an 
interview Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Many frustrated investors don't take the trouble to put it in  
writing, she noted. Those who do usually have already complained to 
their online broker and are sending a copy to the SEC regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	The most frequent complaints against online brokerages include:  
failure to process investors' buy or sell orders or delays in 
executing trades; errors in processing trading orders; and 
investors having trouble getting into their online trading accounts 
or reaching their broker by e-mail or telephone. 
</P>
<P>
	The complaints appear to be evenly spread among the 100 or so  
online brokerage firms, regulators say. 
</P>
<P>
	In each case, one of the SEC's investor assistance specialists --  
there are now 18 or so -- evaluates the complaint and contacts the 
online brokerage firm involved. 
</P>
<P>
	Some examples from the SEC's files:  
</P>
<P>
	--A California man placed a market order online in May to buy  
1,000 shares of EntreMed, a biomedical company whose stock has been 
moving sharply. He figured the order would be executed promptly 
near $13 a share, which was where EntreMed was quoted at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	Market orders are executed fully and promptly without regard to  
price, as opposed to limit orders, which are filled only at a price 
specified by the investor or better price. 
</P>
<P>
	There was a delay, and by the time the man's order was executed,  
he said he was charged $83 a share. 
</P>
<P>
	--A Maryland couple placed a limit order to sell 300 shares of a  
stock but changed their minds two minutes later, specifying a lower 
target price. Four minutes later, as the stock continued to drop, 
they canceled the second order, wishing to hold on to it. 
</P>
<P>
	They received a computer message: ``Both orders closed/nothing  
done,'' but then got a confirmation that the first order was 
executed six minutes after the second order was canceled. 
</P>
<P>
	As a first step, Ms. Smith advises, investors should talk to  
their broker and try to resolve the complaint. If that fails, they 
should write to the brokerage firm's compliance officer. 
</P>
<P>
	If no resolution is reached, investors should send a copy of the  
complaint to the SEC's investor education office at 450 5th Street, 
N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549. The agency's Web site is at 
www.sec.gov.

<HEADLINE> $2M Suit Reinstated Against Disney </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A federal appeals court reinstated a  
lawsuit Friday that accused the Walt Disney Co. of pressuring a 
dying executive into surrendering $2 million in benefits by 
threatening to reveal alleged kickbacks he had received. 
</P>
<P>
	A jury should decide whether a Disney representative pressured  
the executive to sign a deathbed waiver of life insurance, stock 
options and other benefits, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge dismissed the lawsuit in January 1997, saying  
there was insufficient evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court said the circumstances of a hospital meeting  
in which a Disney financial officer obtained a signed waiver of 
benefits, in addition to Robert Jahn's illness and the $2 million 
that Disney and its insurer stood to gain raised the possibility of 
undue influence that was enough to take the case to a jury. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no witnesses at the hospital meeting three weeks  
before Jahn died in May 1994 from complications of AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
	Disney contends Jahn voluntarily gave up the benefits in return  
for retaining medical coverage and the company's promise not to 
disclose his admission that he took hundreds of thousands of 
dollars in kickbacks from vendors seeking contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad to see the justice system works,'' Ron Stock, a  
lawyer for Jahn's estate, said of the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas Freeman, a lawyer for Disney, was unavailable for  
comment, his office said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jahn had been a senior vice president for creative services at  
Walt Disney Pictures and Television since 1991.

<HEADLINE> Chicago's Homeless Face Eviction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Just 30 feet beneath the city's ritziest shops,  
restaurants and offices lies the secret underworld of downtown 
Chicago -- a network of dank, cavernous roadways that have been a 
haven for the homeless since the Depression. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, thousands of men, women and children flocked to the  
so-called Hoover Hotel. More recently the most hardcore of the 
homeless have made their home in the subterranean nooks of lower 
Wacker Drive. 
</P>
<P>
	But this week, the city gave in to business owners who have been  
complaining about the mess and stench. New rules that took effect 
Friday allow property owners to lock gates every night to block off 
concrete loading docks and heating grates, leaving scores of 
homeless people no place to sleep. 
</P>
<P>
	``We come across looking like brutes, but really no one is doing  
anyone any service by encouraging them to live on lower Wacker 
Drive,'' said John Camper, a spokesman for Mayor Richard Daley. 
``We treat the poor and the homeless as well as we can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, many in the underground wondered where they would go.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's kind of unfair, kicking us out of here. But if that's  
what the government wants, I'll do what they want,'' James Marion 
said Friday, as he sat in a chair on Lower Wacker drinking a cup of 
coffee amid bundles of blankets and other belongings he was 
watching for friends. 
</P>
<P>
	Marion said he's been living there since he was released from a  
Veteran's Administration hospital eight years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll just pack up my blankets and what I can carry,'' he said.  
``A toothbrush, mouthwash, cologne.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About three blocks away, Tony Evans descended from the sunshine  
to look for a friend he wanted to warn that police might arrest 
anyone who ignores the 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. lockout. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearby, piles of ratty blankets and a stray office chair were  
surrounded by a cardboard box that contained foam plates, orange 
peels and leftover rice. Meanwhile, pigeons pecked at a few 
scattered bread crumbs on the urine-tinged concrete. 
</P>
<P>
	``Me myself, I got a rough situation,'' said Evans, who left  
Lower Wacker to live with a friend in the Cabrini-Green housing 
project seven months ago. ``But it's worse for these guys. They 
don't have nowhere to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Advocates for the poor question how many of the city's 5,424  
shelter beds are available on any given night -- and whether people 
who've lived on Lower Wacker would even stay there if they were 
available. 
</P>
<P>
	``They choose to live down there because they don't want anyone  
to tell them `Cut your hair and get a job,' so to speak,'' said 
Sister Connie Driscoll, who heads the St. Martin dePorres shelter 
and sits on the city's homeless task force. 
</P>
<P>
	The new rules don't help the image of a city that has been  
accused of shuttling the homeless to sites unseen during big 
events, including the Democratic National Convention in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's all in an effort to try to hide the problem of  
homelessness,'' said Daniel Tardiff of the Chicago Coalition for 
the Homeless. ``It's happening all over the country. They're trying 
to make the issue faceless.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for the Building Owners and Managers Association of  
Chicago did not return messages Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Studs Terkel, a writer and Chicago historian, said Lower Wacker  
should remain the haven it's always been. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it weren't for the warm grates we would've had 80 frozen  
corpses down there during the big blizzard,'' said Terkel, who 
planned to speak at a rally opposing the lockout Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not too hard to become homeless. One or two bad breaks, a  
serious illness -- bang -- suddenly you're homeless.''

<HEADLINE> Lewinsky Tell-All Stirs Interest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Orders are piling up for ``Monica's Story'' --  
the story she wants to tell. 
</P>
<P>
	The book by British writer Andrew Morton on Monica Lewinsky,  
based on exclusive interviews with her, has begun selling briskly 
on the Web sites of two major online booksellers, in advance of its 
expected release in late February. 
</P>
<P>
	Well before the blizzard of publicity, including a Barbara  
Walters interview with Ms. Lewinsky designed to be shown near the 
time of the book's release, ``Monica's Story'' on Friday stood at 
59 on the new weekly list of top 100 bestsellers at the Barnes and 
Noble site. 
</P>
<P>
	Amazon.com, meanwhile, ranked the book 657th in sales at one  
point Friday, which spokesman Bill Curry called a strong showing 
for an unpublished book. The rankings of Amazon.com's 10,000 most 
popular titles reflect sales over the previous 24 hours and change 
every hour. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnes and Noble is telling readers the 288-page book will be  
available Feb. 21; Amazon.com says only that it will be published 
late in the month. 
</P>
<P>
	Publicity surrounding the book may be complicated by terms of  
her immunity deal with independent counsel Kenneth Starr barring 
Ms. Lewinsky from speaking to the news media about her relationship 
with President Clinton without approval from Starr's office. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky is trying to win legal clearance to go ahead with  
the Walters interview. But the immunity deal has not been an 
obstacle to the book. 
</P>
<P>
	Morton, a biographer of the late Princess Diana, is quoted in  
publicity material as saying the woman he came to know bears little 
resemblance to her public image. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Monica I discovered is a bright, lively, and witty young  
woman who bears the scars of her continuing public shaming, but 
remains undefeated.''

<HEADLINE> Crowd Gathers for Abu-Jamal Concert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Despite protests from police  
groups, several prominent musicians performed a sold-out concert to 
raise money for the defense of a death row inmate convicted of 
killing a policeman. 
</P>
<P>
	The Beastie Boys, Rage Against the Machine, Bad Religion, and  
Black Star headlined Thursday's $30-a-ticket concert. 
</P>
<P>
	A portion of the $480,000 in proceeds will be donated to the  
defense of Mumia Abu-Jamal, a black former radio reporter on death 
row for the 1981 killing of a white Philadelphia police officer. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the main points about this is Mumia did not receive a  
fair trial and that's something everyone should be concerned 
about,'' said Mike Diamond of the Beastie Boys. ``If that goes away 
we're basically living in a police state.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Abu-Jamal was convicted of killing of Daniel Faulkner. He claims  
authorities coerced an eyewitness to testify against him, unfairly 
stacked a jury with white people and railroaded him to a guilty 
verdict. 
</P>
<P>
	Police and prosecutors say he was fairly convicted based on  
physical evidence and testimony. Police found the dying officer and 
a wounded Abu-Jamal lying near his own gun. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bottom line is this guy has been tried and convicted, and  
has been allowed numerous appeals. Where we're coming from is 
enough is enough,'' said Bob Scully, executive director of the 
National Association of Police Organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Christie Whitman had urged fans of the bands to stay home.

<HEADLINE> Maine City Fights English-Only Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEWISTON, Maine (AP) -- Quelle horreur!  
</P>
<P>
	A proposal by a state lawmaker from a neighboring city to make  
English the official language of state government has prompted 
outrage in Lewiston, where 60 percent of the population is of 
French or French-Canadian descent. 
</P>
<P>
	Arthur Beauchesne gave a terse assessment of the man at the  
center of the flap during a game of pinochle: ``He's a cabbage 
head.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Thomas Shields, a freshman Republican from Auburn, urged  
residents to keep an open mind. He took offense at suggestions his 
bill is racist and said he himself has French heritage. 
</P>
<P>
	``The measure does not mandate that English be the only language  
used in schools or posted on road signs. The proposed law simply 
states that the daily business of government will be conducted in 
English,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Douglas Ahearne, co-chairman of the State and Local Government  
Committee, predicts there will be a large turnout next month for 
the bill's public hearing but predicted that it will not survive a 
committee vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the Lewiston Sun Journal weighed in with an editorial,  
saying debate on the bill would be hurtful. 
</P>
<P>
	``Est ce que les legislateurs ont quelque chose de plus  
important a faire?'' the editorial said. (Translation, ``Don't 
legislators have more important things to do?'')

<HEADLINE> Man Fights To Save Packard Plant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Inside the cavernous hulk of the Packard Motor  
Car Co.'s landmark factory, tons of scrap tire share space with 
junk, vintage cars and Dominic Cristini -- a man on a lonely mission 
to save the tattered building from demolition. 
</P>
<P>
	Holed up in an office inside the plant since November, Cristini  
eats there and sleeps there -- refusing to leave in protest of city 
efforts to evict 87 tenants by Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to give everything I've got to save this building,''  
says the 38-year-old Cristini, his graying hair pulled into a 
ponytail, an earring in his left ear. 
</P>
<P>
	Detroit officials want to tear down the building to make way for  
an industrial park. In a move toward demolition, the City Council 
voted in November to replace Cristini as property manager. 
</P>
<P>
	To him, it doesn't make sense to eliminate one of the last  
vestiges of the dawning of the automotive age. The building arose 
in 1907, a year before Henry Ford introduced his Model T. By the 
1930s, it was humming along as the nation's premier maker of luxury 
cars. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to save this history for my kids and my kids' kids,''  
says Cristini, whose Packard Motor Properties had been managing the 
3.5-million-square-foot property since 1997, after the city 
acquired it through tax foreclosures. 
</P>
<P>
	When Cristini got voted out as property manager, it inspired him  
-- and thus began his sit-in. 
</P>
<P>
	He sued the city and refused to leave the plant even for  
Thanksgiving and Christmas, seeing his children -- ages 14, 11 and 9 
-- only when they visit on weekends. With a refrigerator but no 
stove, he gets by on any food he can have delivered. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm here for the duration,'' he promises.  
</P>
<P>
	Packards were the car of choice for 1930s movie moguls and  
tycoons. During war years, the independent automaker supplied the 
military with trucks and other equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	But after World War II, Packard lost its prewar momentum -- and  
Cadillac had overtaken it as the market leader in elegant cars. Out 
of step and doomed, the plant was shut down in 1956. 
</P>
<P>
	Once a prototype for future auto plants, the sprawling building  
has become a warehouse of sorts as it has been shuffled among 
owners through the years. 
</P>
<P>
	Decades of natural wear and neglect have taken a weary toll:  
Windows are shattered, often used as target practice by vandals. 
The roof is rotting and porous. 
</P>
<P>
	The city is working to help relocate tenants, among them  
mechanics and small manufacturers -- and storers of everything from 
simple junk to -- of all things -- vintage Packards. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to be reasonable and sensitive,'' to the tenants, said  
city planning and development Director Paul Bernard. 
</P>
<P>
	Some believe that at least part of the plant should be turned  
into a museum. Bernard says the city isn't averse to that idea for 
a sliver of it -- but mainly, ``the city's desire is to develop the 
area to stabilize the community,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	Don Sommer leases 18,000 square feet to house 45 classic cars --  
20 of them Packards built from 1930 to 1956 -- that he has acquired 
with his son. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is very tragic that it's on the verge of being torn down,''  
says Sommer, president of American Arrow Corp., a Clawson maker of 
parts for vintage automobiles. ``I think it'd be a wonderful museum 
for the entire southeast Michigan area.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cristini claims to have lined up at least $10 million from  
private investors willing to buy and mend the plant, though he 
won't name them. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, he presses on with his campaign to salvage some history  
in his own way. He likens himself to Robin Hood, protecting ``the 
little guys'' from a city he considers a pillaging Sheriff of 
Nottingham. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're defending something we think is an honorable cause,'' he  
says.

<HEADLINE> Long-Term Bonds Reverse Early Loss / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Long-term bonds shook off early losses Friday to  
end with gains. 
</P>
<P>
	A report of stronger-than-expected economic growth had dampened  
hopes for fresh cuts in interest rates when Federal Reserve 
policy-makers at a meeting next week, but there was comfort in the 
lowest rise in inflation in decades. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose 11/32  
point, or $3.44 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in 
the opposite direction, fell to 5.08 percent from 5.10 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said bonds initially fell after a report from the  
Commerce Department that the U.S. economy grew at an annual rate of 
5.6 percent in the October-December quarter, the best showing since 
the spring of 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Signs of strong growth often raise investor fears of a  
resurgence in inflation, something that eats into the value of 
fixed-income investments such as bonds. But bond dealers shrugged 
off the report Friday amid hopes that U.S. inflation would remain 
in check. 
</P>
<P>
	A price index tied to the gross domestic product rose just 1  
percent last year. There hasn't been a rate that low since 1959, 
when it also was 1 percent. That measure of inflation hasn't been 
lower since the 0.9 percent of 1950. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though inflation remains in check, the robust economic  
growth further reduced hopes that Fed policy-makers would cut rates 
at a meeting next week. The Fed lowered a key short-term rate three 
times late last year to help prop up the economy and to ensure 
liquid markets amid worries over fallout from Russia's financial 
crisis. But the good performance of inflation also made it likely 
the Fed would see no need to raise rates to cool off the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market, prices of short-term Treasury securities  
were mixed, ranging from a loss of 1-32 point to a gain of 1-32 
point, and intermediate maturities were up 1/32 point to 3/32 
point, reported Bridge Telerate, a financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 4.46 percent as the  
discount fell 0.01 percentage point from Thursday to 4.36 percent. 
Six-month yields were 4.45 percent, as the discount rose 0.02 
percentage point to 4.30 percent. One-year yields were 4.49 percent 
as the discount fell by 0.01 percentage point to 4.30 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, was unchanged from late Thursday at 4.81 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds rose to 126 1/32 from 125 15/16. The average 
yield to maturity fell to 5.09 percent from 5.10 percent.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Proposes HUD Spending Hike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said today that America's  
booming economy presents a unique opportunity to address the 
nation's problems, and he proposed a $2.5 billion spending increase 
for the Department of Housing and Urban Development. 
</P>
<P>
	The president announced his proposal in an East Room speech to  
the nation's mayors, who heartily applauded the initiative. If 
approved by Congress, it would raise HUD's budget to $28 billion 
for housing programs for the needy. 
</P>
<P>
	``The present prosperity is an opportunity and a responsibility  
to make sure that opportunity and prosperity reaches every person 
into every corner of this country, into every neighborhood in every 
city of this country,'' the president said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we cannot do this now with what some people believe is the  
strongest overall economy in our history, believe me, we will never 
get around to doing the job,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He unveiled his proposal as the government announced that the  
U.S. economy grew at an enviable 5.6 percent annual rate during the 
final three months of 1998. ``Our economy is doing very well,'' the 
president said. 
</P>
<P>
	His measure would include money to increase affordable housing,  
housing vouchers for needy residents in distressed areas and $150 
million for newly designated economic empowerment zones. A 
highlight of his strategy was the initiative he announced earlier 
this month to encourage Wall Street to invest in underserved 
inner-city and rural communities. 
</P>
<P>
	That plan includes a $1 billion tax credit designed to spur $6  
billion in new equity capital for investment in the targeted 
markets and the creation of private investment partnerships, 
patterned after the Overseas Private Investment Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	The president also planned to ask for support for continued  
money for community policing, a ``zero tolerance'' program to keep 
criminals from falling back on drugs and to reduce recidivism, and 
for requiring gun manufacturers to install child safety locks on 
handguns. 
</P>
<P>
	Surveying the health of America's cities, Clinton said the  
mayors should be proud of their accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unemployment in our central cities has fallen by 40 percent  
since 1992. Four of our largest 10 cities have cut their 
unemployment rates in half,'' he said. ``We have the highest real 
wage growth in two decades, the lowest African-American and 
Hispanic unemployment rates since such things were first measured 
in 1972, average family income up by $3500, the lowest crime rate 
in now about 26 years and a (crime) drop in our cities that 
averages 27 percent.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Oil, Gas Rig Count at New Low / Oil and Gas Rig Count  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- The number of rigs actively exploring for oil and  
natural gas in the United States plummeted by 26 to an all-time low 
of 562 Friday. It's the second consecutive week for the energy 
industry yardstick to reach a record low. 
</P>
<P>
	Until Houston-based Baker Hughes Inc. reported 588 working rigs  
last Friday, the company's lowest rig count was 596, reported June 
12, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Baker Hughes has kept track of the count since 1944. The tally  
peaked at 4,530 on Dec. 28, 1981, during the height of the oil 
boom. 
</P>
<P>
	Tony McAloon, director of market research at Baker Hughes, said  
there probably are fewer rigs looking for oil and gas in the 
country now than at any time since the boomtown days of the early 
1900s. 
</P>
<P>
	Suffering Asian economies, heavy production by oil-laden  
countries and the record-warm conditions of 1998 all have worked to 
create a perceived glut that has depressed prices and, in turn, 
exploration activity. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the rigs running nationwide this week, 119 were exploring for  
oil and 443 for gas. During the same week last year, 987 rigs were 
operating in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the major oil- and gas-producing states, only Alaska and New  
Mexico added rigs, each increasing its totals by two. Louisiana 
lost seven rigs from a week ago, Texas lost five, Oklahoma lost 
four, Wyoming three and California one.

<HEADLINE> Lockheed Cuts Marietta Work Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MARIETTA, Ga. (AP) -- About 280 jobs will be cut out over the  
next month at the Lockheed Martin Corp. plant in Marietta, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
	Employees were informed of the planned layoffs this week in a  
company newspaper column by division President Bill Bullock and 
Chief Operating Officer Terry Graham. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must get overall costs down. There's no way around it,''  
the column said. 
</P>
<P>
	The cuts will trim the work force at Lockheed Martin  
Aeronautical Systems by 3 percent from the current level of 9,300. 
The company said it can't rule out more layoffs in the future, 
depending on the plant's efficiency and demand for its products. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the plant won a $450 million contract to update  
cockpit systems on C-5 airlifters, but Graham said it won't offset 
the need for job cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	The company has been hurt by high costs and slow sales for the  
C-130J cargo plane it is building as an updated version of the 
airlifter. Development costs soared as the program fell behind 
schedule.

<HEADLINE> Thomas To Put Season Behind Him </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The smile is back on Frank Thomas' face, and last  
year's dismal season is nothing more than a bad memory now. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to have fun this year. I'm going to make sure I have  
fun,'' he said Friday before signing autographs at the team's 
winter convention. ``That's what I think I lost last year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas struggled through the worst year of his career last year,  
falling into a hitting slump that he couldn't shake until 
September. After seven straight years of batting .300 or better, 
his average fell to .265. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the lowest average of his career, high school included.  
</P>
<P>
	``Last year was not a fun season. But it builds character, and  
you move on with life,'' the two-time MVP said. ``I had seven 
excellent years and then one bump in the road. It's over with. It's 
time to get back to business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas is the only major league player to hit higher than .300  
with 20 home runs, 100 RBIs, 100 runs scored and 100 walks in seven 
consecutive seasons. He won the AL batting title in 1997 after 
hitting .347 with 35 home runs and 125 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	With Albert Belle and Robin Ventura batting behind him, he  
should have had another great season. Instead, he got off to a slow 
start and never recovered. Part of the problem was frustration, 
Thomas said. Despite just two losing seasons in his first seven 
seasons, the White Sox had always fallen short for one reason or 
another. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was just tired of finishing second. For eight or nine years  
we finished second, and it's no fun,'' he said. ``We didn't build 
on the dynasty we had, so it was real disappointing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pitchers also went after him like they never had before, Thomas  
said. It took him almost the entire season to adjust, finally 
finding his groove in September. 
</P>
<P>
	And his personal life took a toll as well. It was common  
knowledge that Thomas was having marital problems, a distraction 
that didn't disappear when he walked into the clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
	``While the season was playing itself out, you could tell there  
was some strain on his life that was a big concern to him, and it 
began to permeate in the clubhouse,'' second-year manager Jerry 
Manuel said. ``Guys would come up to me and say, `Frank's a little 
different this time. This is not really Frank what you're 
seeing.''' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he's put those things behind him,'' Manuel said. ``If  
not, I think he's got a way of handling them that he didn't last 
year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The White Sox lost both Belle and Ventura to free agency in the  
offseason, leaving Thomas to carry the load for what will be one of 
the youngest clubs in the major leagues. That's OK, Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, playing for a team that no one expects to do much might  
be a nice change. That doesn't mean Thomas thinks this season will 
be a wash. Far from it. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of heart and talent in this ballclub. You'll see  
what we can accomplish with it,'' he said. ``For many years we 
didn't have a `Big Three' and we still won a lot of ballgames. I 
feel if these kids grow up like they can at spring training, we'll 
be a very competitive ball club.''

<HEADLINE> Nokia Earns $2.9 Billion in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HELSINKI, Finland (AP) -- Citing a 74-percent growth in mobile  
phone sales, the Finnish telecommunications company Nokia nearly 
doubled its pretax profit last year to 14.6 billion markkaa ($2.92 
billion), up from 8.4 billion markkaa in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are not very many lucky CEOs like myself. Nokia has a  
real dream team,'' Nokia chief executive Jorma Ollila said Friday 
after the results were announced. ``We exceeded all the goals we 
had set for ourselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Total net sales in 1998 increased to 79.2 billion markkaa ($15.5  
billion), from 52.6 billion markkaa the previous year, the company 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The result was in line with market expectations, but failed to  
impress investors as Nokia's stock quickly went from being up 3 
percent to being down 6 percent in midday trading on the Stockholm 
Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Nokia said it has not changed its growth aim this year of 25 to  
35 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	That ``is the right kind of target for us. We feel as good about  
achieving that as we did 12 months ago when we discussed numbers,'' 
Ollila said. 
</P>
<P>
	The mobile phones sector of the company was the best performer  
last year, with a growth in net sales of 74 percent over 1997, to 
47.9 billion markkaa ($9.58 billion). Last month, Nokia said it had 
made its 100 millionth cellular phone. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was our product portfolio, our clearly superior product  
portfolio, vis-a-vis our competitors' -- that covered all the main 
standards and consumer segments -- which made the difference, which 
was the driver to our success,'' Ollila said. 
</P>
<P>
	The telecommunications sector showed a sales growth of 39  
percent, to 26.1 billion markkaa ($6.23 billion), the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, Nokia recruited 9,800 new employees, and will  
aggressively continue to expand its workforce in 1999, Ollila said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ollila spoke confidently about plans to expand focus to  
Internet-related systems and multimedia technology. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will be a leader in the wireless data solutions, in the  
fast emerging media phones, offering Internet-capability for 
customers. We will strengthen our capability through acquisitions 
and partnerships,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nokia is a world leader in digital mobile phone technology. It  
has sales in 130 countries, and employs 44,500 people.

<HEADLINE> Gore Addresses World Economic Forum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAVOS, Switzerland (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore today proposed  
``broad and deep'' cuts in barriers to international farm trade and 
urged Japan to do more to help the world economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States will also do its part, he said, speaking at  
the World Economic Forum. President Clinton's 2000 budget, which 
will be sent to Congress next week, will propose ``significant new 
funding'' for relieving the debt of poor nations, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Especially in this time of turmoil, the United States cannot  
and will not take growth for granted,'' Gore told a select audience 
of political and business leaders. ``That is a course we hope other 
nations will follow as well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he said other countries would have to contribute to  
stimulating the world's economy and said the United States cannot 
be the only country to boost imports in economically turbulent 
times. 
</P>
<P>
	``The world looks to Japan to make some appropriate changes in  
the way it discharges its responsibilities as the second-largest 
economy in the world,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said some Japanese claim the world is pressing them to do too  
much, ``but Japan's economy has been stalled for seven years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Please,'' he said. ``We need your help to deal with this  
global economic crisis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also urged the European Union to ``press ahead with  
long-needed structural reforms'' and stimulate domestic demand to 
do its share to help end Asian economic troubles. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore noted that last week President Clinton backed moves for a  
new round of global trade negotiations to expand trade in services, 
manufacturing and farm products. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am especially hopeful that these trade talks will raise  
living standards for the world's farmers and ranchers,'' he said, 
announcing that the United States will call for ``broad and deep'' 
reductions in agricultural tariffs, which now average 40 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore, who arrived Thursday in the Swiss ski resort of Davos to  
speak to the 1,600 business, government and other leaders attending 
the forum, also is meeting on the sidelines with Russian Prime 
Minister Yevgeny Primakov, Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma and 
Swiss President Ruth Dreifuss. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, finance officials from Europe, Japan and the United  
States said they must work together to steer the world economy away 
from crisis but had trouble agreeing on specific measures. 
</P>
<P>
	There was discord on issues such as whether Japan is about to  
emerge from its economic malaise and whether currency controls 
would help or harm global financial stability. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said he opposed calls  
by Japan and several European countries for coordination by the 
world's seven wealthiest nations to try to limit currency 
fluctuations. 
</P>
<P>
	Summers said recent financial crises ``had much more to do with  
domestic capital flight than it did with the behavior of external 
speculators.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eisuke Sakakibara, Japan's vice minister of finance, predicted  
that Japan's economy will bottom out by the middle of this year. 
``Financial panic ... is about to be over,'' he claimed. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Summers -- whose remarks are closely watched by market  
insiders because of their bearing on the value of the dollar -- 
expressed skepticism over a Japanese rebound this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we need to wait before we declare victory'' in Japan,  
he said. Success depends on how changes to Japan's regulatory and 
tax systems are carried through, he added.

<HEADLINE> Jury Deliberates in Capano Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) -- A politically connected attorney  
convicted of killing his mistress asked a jury Thursday to spare 
his life for his family's sake. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas Capano, 49, did not admit his crime or express remorse  
but instead bitterly denounced ``the disloyalty of friends'' who 
testified against him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to sit here and beg for my life,'' Capano said.  
``I do ask you to consider my daughters, my mother and the rest of 
my family. For their sake, I do ask you to let me live.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors began deliberating Thursday whether to recommend the  
death penalty for Capano, convicted earlier this month for the 
murder of Anne Marie Fahey in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Capano did not back away from his story that another mistress  
accidentally shot Ms. Fahey, but said getting rid of her body and 
lying about her death ``were the acts of a frightened man who had 
lost his moral compass.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Ferris Wharton said if Capano is sentenced to life in  
prison, he could still find a way to hurt people, noting that while 
awaiting trial Capano tried to have a witness' home ransacked. 
</P>
<P>
	``That type of evil is relentless and cannot be confined,''  
Wharton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors convicted Capano on Jan. 17 of the murder of Ms. Fahey,  
who was Gov. Thomas Carper's scheduling secretary. 
</P>
<P>
	For 2 1/2 years, Capano maintained he didn't know what had happened  
to Ms. Fahey after they dined at a Philadelphia restaurant June 27, 
1996. During the trial, he admitted to stuffing Ms. Fahey's body in 
a cooler and dumped it at sea. 
</P>
<P>
	But he claimed another mistress, Deborah MacIntyre, accidentally  
shot her in a jealous, suicidal rage. Ms. MacIntyre denied being at 
Capano's house that night.

	Without a body or a murder weapon, prosecutors relied on  
circumstantial evidence to prove that Capano planned to kill Ms. 
Fahey because she wanted to end their three-year affair. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Thursday, Capano's 76-year-old mother, Marguerite,  
tearfully pleaded for her oldest son's life from her wheelchair 
before the jury. 
</P>
<P>
	``My son is not a murderer,'' she said. ``I don't care what  
anyone says, they will never convince me of that. I love him. I 
need him.''

<HEADLINE> Herpes Hits High School Wrestlers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	QUINCY, Ill. (AP) -- An outbreak of the herpes virus among high  
school wrestlers has been traced back to a wrestling meet two weeks 
ago that drew athletes from 20 schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Public health and school district officials said Thursday that  
six wrestlers from three schools have shown symptoms of the virus, 
herpes simplex type 1, and many others may be at risk. They are 
tracking the spread of the disease, hoping to contain it. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike genital herpes, herpes simplex type 1 is common in the  
general population and usually shows itself as a cold sore around 
the mouth or nose. 
</P>
<P>
	Wrestlers are particularly at risk because of the nature of  
their sport, with frequent skin abrasions and contact with saliva 
and open sores. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're down there face-to-face. They're sweaty. They're hot.  
Someone has an outbreak, someone has a cold sore, and you've got 
your nose rubbing in the person's face,'' said Lynn VanPelt, 
director of family services for the Health Department in McDonough 
County, where one wrestler from Macomb High School contracted the 
virus at the meet in Quincy. 
</P>
<P>
	State health officials have no idea how many students may have  
the virus, which is incurable but can be treated with drugs to 
contain outbreaks. 
</P>
<P>
	Other states have encountered much more widespread outbreaks. A  
1996 outbreak in Washington led to a survey that determined that 
one out of five student wrestlers there had contagious herpes 
lesions.

<HEADLINE> Mass. Foster Care Sex Suit Settled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- A family who claimed a 15-year-old foster daughter  
had sex with their 11-year-old son and bore a child have reached a 
settlement with the social service agency that placed the girl in 
the home. 
</P>
<P>
	The parents of the boy claimed they were not told the teen-ager  
may have been sexually abused and acted sexually aggressive toward 
younger children. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit against Mentor Inc. and the state Department of Social  
Services was in the fourth day of trial Thursday when Mentor agreed 
to settle the case. 
</P>
<P>
	The amount Mentor, a private agency with a state contract to  
find foster homes, agreed to pay the family was confidential, but 
Boston newspapers said it was about $700,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The Department of Social Services showed that Mentor had agreed  
to take full responsibility for the girl. 
</P>
<P>
	The 15-year-old girl was placed with the family, which had taken  
in foster children before, in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Sex between the children allegedly took place that year and the  
next until the boy's mother found them embracing in June 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	The foster family then ended its care of the girl, but the  
parents said they did not know she was pregnant until after she was 
moved from their home. 
</P>
<P>
	The boy now is 20, and the girl is 23. Their 6-year-old daughter  
lives with her mother.

<HEADLINE> Teacher Found Guilty in Grade Scam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DURHAM, N.C. (AP) -- A former university biology instructor was  
convicted of giving a student a passing grade in exchange for a 
television set and video game. 
</P>
<P>
	Vonda Lekecia Reed got a suspended sentence and three years'  
probation Thursday on a charge of obtaining property by false 
pretenses. She also was ordered to perform 100 hours of community 
service and to pay back $1,217 for the television set and game. 
</P>
<P>
	Reed's first trial in 1997 ended in a mistrial after the jury  
deadlocked. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time of the offense, Reed was a lecturer in the North  
Carolina Central University biology department. 
</P>
<P>
	Reed was accused of giving student Lynetta Golden a passing  
grade in return for the game and a drastically discounted 31-inch 
television set from Service Merchandise, where Golden worked. 
Evidence showed that a stolen credit card number was used for both 
transactions in April 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Golden, who testified against Reed, told a store official that  
she did it because she needed a good grade in zoology.

<HEADLINE> Falcons De-Activate Four Players </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CORAL GABLES, Fla. (AP) -- Dreading the task, Atlanta Falcons  
coach Dan Reeves told four players Friday they wouldn't be dressing 
for the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Offensive lineman Dave Widell, tight end Rod Monroe, safety Omar  
Brown and cornerback Darren Anderson were the initial four players 
placed on the inactive list. 
</P>
<P>
	Three more players will be added Sunday, an hour before the  
game, along with the designation of a third-string quarterback who 
can be in uniform. 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves found it especially tough to inform Widell, even though  
the decision was expected. The 11-year veteran hasn't been on the 
active roster since Week 2. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's one of the things I struggled the most with,'' Reeves  
said. ``I can't understand why you can't at least have them dress 
out. They can't play, but why in the world, the biggest game they 
ever play in, a guy can't dress in the Super Bowl makes no sense to 
me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Widell, who came into the league in 1988 with the Dallas  
Cowboys, also played with Denver and Jacksonville before signing 
with the Falcons this season. He has never played in the Super 
Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's been in the league a long time and this is his chance to  
play in his first Super Bowl,'' Reeves said. ``Omar Brown is a 
rookie, but should have a chance to dress for the Super Bowl. I 
lobbied for it, but made no progress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons practiced for 1 hour, 45 minutes on Friday at the  
University of Miami, adding the final touches to their game plan 
for the Denver Broncos. It was a non-contact workout in helmets, 
shells and shorts. 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons will complete their preparations with a short  
walk-through at Pro Player Stadium on Saturday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``Well, we got it all done,'' Reeve said. ``I thought the  
practice, again, was good. I've been pleased with practice, but 
I've never been able to relate practice to how we play. I've seen 
us practice bad and play well, and vice-versa. You never know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Second-string running back Ken Oxendine portrayed Denver's  
2,000-yard rusher, Terrell Davis, on the scout team. Oxendine even 
wore one of Davis's blue No. 30 jerseys all week, borrowing it from 
teammate Jamal Anderson, who traded shirts with Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think (Oxendine) did a good job, but what you don't know is  
how difficult it is to bring (Davis) down,'' Reeves said. ``You 
know, a lot of times in practice, all you do is stick out an arm. 
We've tried real hard to work on breaking down, and understanding 
you can't bring him down with an arm tackle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After practice, the Falcons enjoyed an outdoor barbecue lunch  
under partly cloudy skies with temperatures approaching 80 degrees.

<HEADLINE> Mo. Family Thankful for Pope's Help </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	REEDS SPRING, Mo. (AP) -- For Darrell Mease's mother, it was  
never a matter of whether, but simply when, her son's death 
sentence for killing three people would be commuted to life in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were listening for this, Darrell and I were listening for  
this for years,'' Lexie Mease said Friday. ``We didn't know how 
long we would have to wait, but we knew it would happen. We weren't 
depending on man. We were depending on God.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Mel Carnahan spared her son's life Thursday after an  
extraordinary face-to-face plea from Pope John Paul II. While 
everyone from political pundits to religious leaders were 
flabbergasted, Mease had told his brother, Larry, to expect 
something remarkable. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said he didn't know when it would happen. But he snapped  
his fingers and said, 'When it does it will be just like this. And 
everybody will know about it,''' Larry Mease said about a death row 
visit with his brother last Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mease, 52, was facing execution for the 1988 murders of a former  
drug partner, the man's wife and the couple's paraplegic grandson. 
The governor had previously considered 27 death sentences and 
commuted only one. 
</P>
<P>
	``If somebody told you the pope was going to come over here and  
do that, you'd think they was crazy,'' said Larry Mease. 
</P>
<P>
	Mease's 71-year-old mother said she had never been in contact  
with any representative of the pope, and didn't believe her son had 
either. 
</P>
<P>
	The area Mease grew up in is a collection of hardscrabble farms  
and ramshackle old homes mixed in with shiny new vacation cabins, 
horse stables, fancy restaurants and antique shops for tourists 
visiting Branson. 
</P>
<P>
	It's an area that Mease hopes to return to someday and take up  
the ministry. He renewed his faith shortly after going to prison 
and has said often that God has been his lawyer during all of his 
appeals. 
</P>
<P>
	``Vietnam and his first wife, that seemed to put him on a  
different path,'' said his brother, recalling how Mease had come 
home from the war in the 1960s disillusioned and cynical. 
</P>
<P>
	Mease got married and had five children, who range in age from  
13 to 18. But he has said that he turned to drugs and drifted away 
from the church during that time. He was divorced twice. 
</P>
<P>
	After living in Kansas City for a time, he returned home to the  
Ozarks and eventually found work as a carpenter. One of the people 
he worked for was Lloyd Lawrence, who Mease has said also taught 
him how to make the drug methamphetamine. 
</P>
<P>
	In a confession he later recanted, Mease said he had hidden  
along a path near the Lawrences' secluded house and shot them with 
a 12-gauge shotgun. He later contended the confession had been 
obtained illegally. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Mease refuses to discuss the killings. Reminded that her  
son's sentence is now life without parole, she smiled and said the 
same prayers that saved his life will eventually set him free. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can come back and see us when he comes home,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> LTV Blames Loss on Steel Imports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Steel maker LTV Corp., blaming cheap imports,  
reported a $61 million fourth-quarter loss and a 14 percent drop in 
quarterly sales Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The loss, which amounted to 62 cents per share, included pretax  
charges of $55 million. In last year's fourth quarter, LTV earned 
$32 million, or 31 cents a share. Sales fell to $989 million, from 
$1.15 billion last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding the extraordinary charges, which covered the costs of  
closing certain facilities and cutting jobs, LTV's loss was $14 
million, or 15 cents a share. That topped analysts' expectations of 
a loss of 18 cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of LTV, which initially fell, ended the day unchanged at  
$6.93 3/4 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	For the year, LTV lost $27 million, or 29 cents a share,  
compared to profits of $30 million, or 27 cents per share in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales slipped 4 percent, to $4.27 billion from $4.45 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	``Unprecedented levels of unfairly traded imports continue to  
flood our markets,'' said Peter Kelly, LTV president and chief 
executive officer. He asked Congress on Wednesday to reduce imports 
to protect U.S. jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Through November, Japanese imports in 1998 increased to 5.7  
million metric tons, up from 2.1 million tons for the same period 
in 1997. U.S. steel makers say the influx has forced them to reduce 
prices and contributed to more than 10,000 layoffs.

<HEADLINE> Senate Prepares Witness Subpoenas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate delivered subpoenas Friday for  
Monica Lewinsky and two of President Clinton's advisers, summoning 
them for private, videotaped testimony beginning Monday in the 
impeachment trial. Public showing of the tapes -- or even live 
testimony -- was still an open question. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial moved to a new phase as Sergeant at Arms James Ziglar  
-- the man who makes the ``Hear ye, hear ye'' proclamation at the 
start of each trial session -- carried the subpoenas out of the 
Capitol in a manila envelope. 
</P>
<P>
	Accompanied by Senate lawyers, he delivered the papers to  
attorneys representing Ms. Lewinsky, presidential friend Vernon 
Jordan and White House aide Sidney Blumenthal. 
</P>
<P>
	The deposition testimony commanded by the subpoenas could go a  
long way to determine whether any of the three will be called 
before the Senate, whether additional witnesses may be necessary 
and -- ultimately -- whether the trial can be finished by the Feb. 12 
date cited by both political parties. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky, whose relationship with the president led to the  
perjury and obstruction-of-justice charges, will be questioned 
Monday at the Mayflower Hotel, according to her spokeswoman. The 
former intern was interviewed there last Sunday by three of the 
House prosecutors, including Rep. Ed Bryant of Tennessee, who will 
conduct the new questioning. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan's deposition will be Tuesday and Blumenthal's on  
Wednesday in a Capitol office used by the Senate Intelligence 
Committee. It is guarded and always off-limits to the public and 
the news media. 
</P>
<P>
	Senators will have a chance to review videotapes of the  
testimony before reconvening the trial next Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	If any significant, new information is developed, or if the  
demeanor of the witnesses becomes an issue, the chance of live 
testimony would increase. It would take only a majority vote to 
bring any of the three to the Senate floor. 
</P>
<P>
	The barrier is higher, however, for additional witnesses.  
Democratic leader Tom Daschle would have to agree with Majority 
Leader Trent Lott that new witnesses were necessary, giving the 
minority Democrats veto power in this area. 
</P>
<P>
	Also on Friday, the Senate's Republican and Democratic leaders  
each chose three senators to referee the questioning by House 
prosecutors and White House lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republicans chose Sen. Mike DeWine of Ohio to be at Ms.  
Lewinsky's deposition, Fred Thompson of Tennessee for Jordan's 
questioning and Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania for the examination 
of Sidney Blumenthal. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democrats picked Sens. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, John  
Edwards of North Carolina and Christopher Dodd of Connecticut to 
attend the depositions but made no immediate decision on which 
proceeding each would attend. 
</P>
<P>
	At the White House, spokesman Joe Lockhart complained anew about  
the arrangements for the final stages of the trial -- especially the 
uncertainty. He accused the Republican-run Senate of ``making up 
the rules literally on the back of an envelope. ... That raises 
some issues about whether that's fair to all sides.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There is an attempt here by the Republican majority to play  
out this process in a way that can inflict maximum political damage 
on the president,'' he said, suggesting there could be ``an endless 
proceeding of new witnesses, new evidence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, many senators headed back to their states where they  
could expect a firsthand taste of sentiment about a trial that most 
Americans -- if polls can be believed -- want to see ended. 
</P>
<P>
	With the trial on hold until next Thursday, Lott was only  
half-joking when he asked the U.S. Conference of Mayors: ``Do you 
realize how really difficult it is, how extremely exhausting it is 
for United States senators to sit in one place for six hours at a 
time and listen to others speak? I mean, there's no vent, no way to 
let off steam.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lott, who referred to a rule that senators remain silent at the  
trial ``on pain of imprisonment,'' told the mayors he was glad to 
``be anywhere but where I've been for the last three weeks, 
tethered to the floor of the United States Senate. ``We feel like 
we're free at last.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The depositions are to begin at 9 a.m. EST each day and end  
after eight hours unless Lott and Daschle agree to extend the time. 
The examination time will be equally divided between House 
prosecutors and White House lawyers, with each side allowed two 
lawyers to conduct the questioning. 
</P>
<P>
	The scope is to be limited ``to the subject matters reflected in  
the Senate record.'' The senator-overseers will make initial 
rulings on objections, but any deeper disputes could be brought 
before the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, CNN formally appealed to the Senate on Friday to open  
its impeachment deliberations, arguing that closing the doors to 
the public was an affront to the First Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate twice went into closed session this week, once to  
debate a motion by Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., to dismiss the 
impeachment articles against President Clinton and again to 
deliberate on whether to call witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic Sens. Tom Harkin of Iowa and Paul Wellstone of  
Minnesota have sponsored motions to open all proceedings, but have 
been unsuccessful. They plan to keep forcing votes on the issue.

<HEADLINE> Mariners Claim They Lost $2 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- The owners of the Seattle Mariners had their best  
financial results since they bought the franchise in mid-1992, 
claiming the team lost $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``At some point, the bleeding has to stop,'' Mariners president  
Chuck Armstrong said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mariners say they lost $16.9 million in 1993, $15 million in  
1994, $20.2 million in 1995, $13.2 million in 1996 and $4 million 
in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong told The Seattle Times the figures include a $9.3  
million payment the Mariners received in 1998 as part of the 
expansion fees paid by Tampa Bay and Arizona. Without that money, 
he said Seattle's owners would have lost more than $11 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball's central offices, however, do not include expansion  
fees as operating income. Rather, it is listed as income from the 
sale of a capital asset. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mariners' attendance fell from a franchise record 3.2  
million in 1997, when they won the AL West, to 2.6 million last 
season, when they finished third. Seattle is scheduled to move into 
Safeco Field after the All-Star break, which should boost revenue 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the team will spend more than $126 million as its share  
of the construction costs. The Mariners originally were to pay $45 
million of the $417 million estimate, but the team is responsible 
for cost overruns, currently expected to be $81 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Hiroshi Yamauchi, president of Nintendo Co. Ltd. of Kyoto,  
Japan, is the principal owner of the Mariners. A group headed by 
Yamauchi purchased the team from Jeff Smulyan on June 12, 1992, for 
$100 million plus $25 million in working capital.

<HEADLINE> Doctor Accused of HIV Misdiagnosis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- An Ohio man has sued his former doctor for  
allegedly misdiagnosing him with HIV and then prescribing a potent 
drug that had to be taken each day for more than six years. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Savage contends he was never even tested for HIV by Dr.  
David Blatt and his colleagues at Illinois Masonic Medical Center 
in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Savage, a 43-year-old flight attendant who has since moved from  
Chicago to Dayton, Ohio, did not return a telephone message 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	His lawsuit says he was diagnosed with the AIDS virus in July  
1990 and treated with AZT and other AIDS-fighting drugs through 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to ``extreme mental pain and suffering,'' Savage's  
lawsuit says he experienced such AZT-induced side effects as 
tingling hands, vision and bowel problems, and depression. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, Savage's Ohio doctor questioned his lack of symptoms  
and ordered tests that determined he was not carrying the AIDS 
virus. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was so ecstatic and relieved,'' said Savage's attorney,  
Valerie Leopold. ``It really gave him a new lease on life. Then 
after that began wearing off, questions developed and anger 
developed. ... And then concern developed about, `Gosh, am I the 
only one?''' 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit, filed Tuesday in Cook County Circuit Court, seeks  
more than $50,000 in damages each from Illinois Masonic, Blatt and 
Triad Health Practices, his clinic. 
</P>
<P>
	A receptionist at Triad referred calls to Illinois Masonic,  
where spokeswoman Carmeline Esposito said lawyers were still 
reviewing the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Catherine Creticos, a Chicago-based infectious disease  
specialist, said it is standard procedure to do several tests to 
determine if a patient is HIV-positive. However, in 1990 some tests 
used today didn't exist, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another test available at the time -- the standard HIV antibody  
test -- can turn from positive to negative but only in rare cases in 
the last stages of the disease, when the body is no longer able to 
produce antibodies to fight off the virus, she said.

<HEADLINE> Woman Shot in Police Confrontation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KENOSHA, Wis. (AP) -- A sandwich shop employee who left a  
farewell note to co-workers was fatally shot by police after 
challenging officers with a loaded pistol. 
</P>
<P>
	Deborah J. Meyer was wounded nine times while standing against a  
concrete wall Thursday night outside a convenience store. 
</P>
<P>
	Meyer, 31, left a job-resignation note, saying she had plans to  
fulfill and that ``she was putting her life in God's hands,'' 
fellow employee Roberta Pouldrin said. 
</P>
<P>
	``What is going to happen must happen,'' the note said.  
</P>
<P>
	Police went to the convenience store parking lot in response to  
a report of a woman with a pistol, police said. She pointed the 
pistol at them, police said. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Silver Charm Favored in Donn Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HALLANDALE, Fla. (AP) -- Silver Charm continues his quest to  
become thoroughbred racing's first $10 million horse as the 
favorite in Saturday's $500,000 Donn Handicap, but the trip isn't 
likely to be an easy one. 
</P>
<P>
	The strapping gray horse will be carrying a significant six to  
16 pounds more than any of his competitors. In addition, he'll be 
starting from outside post in the 12-horse field. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every time he runs, there's no easy spot for him,'' trainer  
Bob Baffert said. ``People like to run against him because they 
know how much interest in the race he brings. Everybody wants to be 
a part of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Silver Charm, who won the San Pasqual Handicap Jan. 10 at Santa  
Anita in his first start of the year, is the unquestioned star 
attraction for Saturday's race at Gulfstream Park, which opens the 
inaugural NTRA Champions schedule. The National Thoroughbred Racing 
Association set up the televised 11-race series to increase the 
sport's visibility. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's crucial that this first one be a good race,'' said Cot  
Campbell, one of the owners of 12-1 shot Early Warning. 
</P>
<P>
	Silver Charm, who will carry 126 pounds, opened as the 8-5 early  
favorite. But the weight factor and his No. 12 starting position 
have rivals thinking they have a chance to knock off racing's 
marquee name. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anytime you draw outside, it costs you a couple of lengths no  
matter who you are, and he's a great horse,'' said H. James Bond, 
who trains 12-1 shot Behrens. 
</P>
<P>
	Ralph Ziadie, trainer of 4-1 second favorite Sir Bear, has been  
predicting an upset all week. Sir Bear has won his past two starts 
since switching to jockey Jerry Bailey, taking in the Cigar Mile at 
Aqueduct and this month's Broward Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like Jerry has a clock in his head,'' Ziadie said. '' He  
can go to the front if necessary, or if there is a fast pace he can 
come from off the pace. He can do whatever is necessary to win, and 
I think he is going to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Puerto Madero, who shipped in from California with Silver Charm,  
is another challenger after winning 10 of 15 lifetime starts, 
including last month's Native Diver Handicap at Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, it would be difficult to bet against Silver Charm, who  
has finished first or second in 19 of his 20 starts. With 
$6,633,006 in earnings for owners Bob and Beverly Lewis, Silver 
Charm is chasing Cigar's all-time record of $9,999,815. 
</P>
<P>
	An ambitious schedule calls for Silver Charm to return to  
California for the Santa Anita Handicap March, then to the Middle 
East to defend his title in the $5 million Dubai World Cup later in 
the month. 
</P>
<P>
	Should Silver Charm win those races and the Donn, it would leave  
him just some $66,000 shy of Cigar's record. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there's a horse that can handle it, it's this horse,''  
Baffert said. ``He's tough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Silver Charm, however, has had an annoying habit of doing just  
enough to win, which has backfired at times. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1997 Belmont Stakes, the failure to detect the  
hard-charging Touch Gold in time probably cost him the Triple 
Crown. Then in last year's Breeder's Cup Classic, Awesome Again 
rallied on the inside while jockey Gary Stevens had Silver Charm 
concentrating on Swain. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure Gary will figure something out,'' Baffert said.  
``Great horses find a way to win.''

<HEADLINE> Senior Skins Golf Pals Laud Palmer  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KONA COAST, Hawaii (AP) -- Although Arnold Palmer's friends will  
be trying to beat him out of some big money this weekend, they 
realize the huge debt they owe him. 
</P>
<P>
	Raymond Floyd, Hale Irwin and Jim Colbert readily acknowledge  
that the Senior Skins Game, the Senior Tour and the PGA Tour 
wouldn't be nearly as successful were it not for Palmer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I appreciate Arnold very much; everything that he's done for  
the game, his leadership,'' said Floyd, who will try for his sixth 
straight victory in the $540,000 Senior Skins. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's the ultimate superstar and we've been lucky to have him.  
Anytime he plays, it means a lot to the game. If there's ever been 
any person synonymous with anything, it's Arnold Palmer in golf. 
He's our hero; he's certainly mine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said Irwin: ``Arnie, because of his longevity and the following  
he's created with his personality, has benefited all of us. That 
doesn't take anything away from Jack (Nicklaus) or Gary (Player) or 
anybody. I just think Arnie is the only player in the game we all 
relate to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Colbert is replacing Nicklaus, who underwent hip replacement  
surgery this week, in the Senior Skins, a four-player event at 
Mauna Lani Resort that begins with nine holes Saturday and ends 
with nine Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``In my rookie year on the circuit, they asked me at a  
tournament in Las Vegas if I could fill in for the pro-am because 
one of the guys couldn't make it,'' Colbert said. ``I said, `Sure.' 
So I walk to the first tee and these guys give me a funny look. I 
asked them who they were supposed to play with and they said, 
`Arnold Palmer.' They were a little disappointed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Colbert credits Palmer with bringing golf into the modern era.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's our Babe Ruth,'' Colbert said. ``He's brought the senior  
circuit to where it is today, he brought the regular circuit to 
where it is today. Our whole show today has been built on what 
Arnold did, with the start of TV coverage and right up to the 
modern day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although the 69-year-old Palmer has been slowed in recent years  
by surgery and radiation treatment for prostate cancer, Colbert 
thinks Palmer is in his element in the skins. 
</P>
<P>
	``A game like we're playing, situation golf, gambling, one-shot  
golf, it's right up his alley,'' Colbert said. ``This is a game he 
can win, so he'll be doubly tough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer enjoys the format.  
</P>
<P>
	``It stimulates me to be playing and hopefully I can do a little  
better,'' said Palmer, who won the Senior Skins three times during 
the 1990s, including 1993 before Floyd began his reign. 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer is only $35,000 short of earning $1 million in the Senior  
Skins. That's almost a third of what he earned by winning a 
combined 92 titles on the PGA Tour, where his 60 victories included 
eight major championships, and Senior PGA Tour -- a total of $3.5 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he makes the Senior Skins Game,'' said Floyd, who tops  
the event's earnings list with $1.8 million. ``I don't think the 
Senior Skins game would be as popular were he not here.' 
</P>
<P>
	In skins competition, there is prize money for each hole. A  
player wins the money if he wins the hole (the ``skin'') outright. 
But if two or more players tie a hole, all are considered tied and 
the money is carried over to the next hole, with the pot continuing 
to build until one player wins a hole. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Senior Skins Game, the first six holes are worth $20,000  
each, the second six $30,000 each and the final six $40,000 each.

<HEADLINE> Russians Win Ice Dance Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) -- Ice dancing's world champions,  
Angelika Krylova and Oleg Ovsiannikov, barely won their first 
European title Friday with an innovative, if risky, free dance set 
to the beat of African drums. 
</P>
<P>
	The title was the third for the Russians in the European Figure  
Skating Championships, which end Saturday with three Russian women 
leading going into the free dance. 
</P>
<P>
	Krylova and Ovsiannikov displayed a nearly calibrated precision  
up to the last moment, when he lowered her from an unusual lift -- 
her ankles wrapped around his head -- right on the final beat. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think champions can try something different, something  
new,'' Krylova said. ``We want to show champions can skate all 
styles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the judges were split between the Russians'  
unconventional, sometimes jarring, definitely not musical, 
presentation, and the traditional dance ``Man in the Iron Mask'' by 
French champions Marina Anissina and Gwendal Peizerat, who finished 
second. 
</P>
<P>
	Marks for the Russians, who skated first, were in the  
conservative 5.8 range, leaving lots of room for an upset. The 
audience seemed to back the French, and four of the nine judges 
placed them first. 
</P>
<P>
	New scoring rules prevented a flip-flop even after Russians  
Irina Lobacheva and Ilia Averbukh took a first-place vote from 
their teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is important that we won the audience,'' Peizerat said. ``I  
think we are European champions for the audience and for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the women's competition, defending European champion Maria  
Butyrskaya won the short program with a sultry, blues program, 
leading Viktoria Volchkova and Julia Soldatova, a pair of 
up-and-coming teen-agers just out of junior ranks. 
</P>
<P>
	Though both held their own in the competitive field, neither  
could approach Butyrskaya's style and secure skating that masked 
the jitters of a defending champion. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was terribly nervous,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Wearing a fire-engine red dress, Butyrskaya melded her movements  
to the long blues notes, swiveling her hips seductively at the 
judges as the trumpets played. 
</P>
<P>
	The program completely wiped away the the memory of Vanessa  
Gusmeroli's short program immediately before to the same music, 
``St. James Infirmary.'' While Butyrskaya hit all her elements, a 
triple lutz-double toe combination, triple loop and the required 
double axel, the French skater's combination was flawed, and her 
presentation no rival for the Russian champ's. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew that there are many skaters on the same level, and that  
one mistake would cost me dearly,'' Gusmeroli said. ``It's a long 
competition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Butyrskaya's success at 26 defies a trend toward younger,  
athletic skaters, like Tara Lipinski, who won the 1998 Olympic gold 
at 15. A six-time Russian national champion, Butyrskaya did not win 
an international championship until Europeans last year, following 
a coaching change. She finished fourth at the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Her younger Russian teammates kept up technically, but could not  
match the mood she created, or her presentation marks of 5.8 and 
5.9. 
</P>
<P>
	Finishing second, 16-year-old Volchkova's lapses showed in her  
loose arm and free leg extensions. And while third-place Soldatova, 
17, skated to seductive music in a lacy costume, her movements did 
not convey any mood. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Russian women hold their places in Saturday's free skate,  
they'll match the men, who swept the European medals Thursday.

<HEADLINE> IOC Member Accuses Samaranch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- A senior African IOC member ousted in the Salt Lake  
City bribery scandal has accused committee president Juan Antonio 
Samaranch of sacrificing his friends to clear his own name. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's saving his skin by throwing shame on others,''  
Jean-Claude Ganga of the Republic of Congo was quoted as saying in 
an interview with French daily Liberation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We used to be friendly, but if he tries to get rid of his  
friends, that will be very dangerous for him,'' Ganga added in the 
interview which appeared Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ganga, 64, was one of six IOC members ousted Sunday in  
connection with cash payments, medical care and other favors 
stemming from Salt Lake City's winning bid for the 2002 Winter 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC inquiry found that Ganga received $216,000 in gifts and  
payments from Salt Lake officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Ganga denies accepting bribes and says he will not resign from  
the IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC said Ganga and the others were essentially expelled  
pending a formal vote by the full assembly in March. Ganga said he 
was counting on ``at least 40'' members of the IOC to back him at 
the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Ganga has been an IOC member since 1986 and heads the  
association of African national Olympic Committees.

<HEADLINE> Judge Rules in Favor of Hoffman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Dustin Hoffman deserves $1.5 million in  
punitive damages for being ``violated by technology'' when a 
magazine used his image without permission, a judge ruled. 
</P>
<P>
	That award is in addition to a $1.5 million judgment he won a  
week ago. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Dickran Tevrizian on Thursday ordered Los  
Angeles magazine to pay the additional damages for publishing a 
computer-altered image of Hoffman's face on the body of a man 
dressed in silk evening gown and heels in March 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm pleased and surprised,'' Hoffman, 61, said outside the  
courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
	Julie Hoover, spokesperson for the magazine's parent, Capital  
Cities/ABC in New York, said the award ``has no basis in fact or 
law, and we plan to appeal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hoffman, who played a man masquerading as a woman in 1982's  
``Tootsie,'' alleged in a $5 million lawsuit that the photo layout 
violated his publicity rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoffman referred to the ``elegant finessing'' of  
computer-altered photos and said he can't help worrying about 
``what the next 20 or 30 years will bring.''

<P>
	NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- United by fears of violence, thousands  
of Christians and Muslims marched through New Delhi on Friday, 
demanding that India's Hindu nationalist-led government step down 
for failing to protect minorities. 
</P>
<P>
	The two communities, which both say they have been targeted by  
Hindu radicals, were brought together by the killing last weekend 
of an Australian Baptist missionary and his two young sons. 
</P>
<P>
	Graham Stains and his sons were burned alive by a mob as they  
slept in their jeep outside a village in eastern India. The 
attackers are suspected to be members of the Bajrang Dal, one of 
many Hindu militant groups linked to the Bharatiya Janata Party, 
which leads the governing coalition. 
</P>
<P>
	Their deaths, which came amid a string of attacks on Christians,  
has created a political storm for Prime Minister Atal Bihari 
Vajpayee, who has been criticized by foes and allies alike. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday's rally was led by the Roman Catholic archbishop of Delhi  
and a senior Muslim clergyman. Marchers paraded from the Jama 
Masjid, the country's main mosque -- a behemoth of red sandstone 
walls and marble domes -- down the busy thoroughfares of the Indian 
capital. 
</P>
<P>
	``What have we got in 50 years? Hate, rape, murder,'' shouted  
the protesters, wearing Muslim caps and black arm bands as they 
waved flags. India won freedom from British colonialists in 1947. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to unite, this is the message of today's rally. This  
is the work of God,'' said Archbishop Alan de Lastic. 
</P>
<P>
	``A prime minister who cannot protect the oppressed minorities  
of his country has no right to stay in power. He should resign,'' 
said Abdullah Bukhari, the head of the Jama Masjid. 
</P>
<P>
	India's Christians number 23 million and mostly reside in four  
southern states. Muslims make up 12 percent of the country's 1 
billion people. 
</P>
<P>
	The protesters marched to the prime minister's residence where  
they submitted a letter on behalf of the Muslim community. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were born here and we will die here. Hindu fundamentalists  
cannot beat us back,'' Ahmed Bukhari, the son of the Jama Masjid's 
head said during a sermon earlier Friday. ``I assure the Christian 
community that the Muslims will stand by them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, the leader of the opposition Congress Party called  
on the BJP's allies to abandon the ruling coalition and bring down 
the government to protest the attacks on minorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense Minister George Fernandes, speaking to foreign  
journalists Friday, insisted that Stains' death was part of a 
conspiracy to besmirch the ruling party, but could not say who was 
behind it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our government is always referred to as a Hindu right-wing  
government, a Hindu fundamentalist government, a Hindu 
government,'' said Fernandes, who is a Christian and leader of a 
small socialist party allied with the BJP. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a not a Hindu government. We are a government working on  
a coalition of parties,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal government plans to create a top-level committee to  
investigate the death of the Baptist missionary. 
</P>
<P>
	Three Cabinet ministers who returned from the area in the  
eastern coastal state of Orissa said they had found no evidence 
linking the attackers to the Bajrang Dal. The three ministers did 
not say who they suspected the killers were. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifty-three people have been arrested for questioning in the  
case.

<HEADLINE> Reno's Decision on New Probe Sealed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With conflicting recommendations from aides,  
Attorney General Janet Reno decided Friday whether an independent 
counsel should investigate alleged perjury by former White House 
deputy chief of staff Harold Ickes, but her ruling remained under 
court seal. 
</P>
<P>
	A Justice Department official filed what Justice sources said  
was Reno's ruling with a special court minutes before the clerk's 
office closed for the weekend. The court must authorize any public 
release. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday was the last day of Reno's six-month-long review of an  
allegation that Ickes lied before a Senate inquiry into campaign 
finances. That's the maximum time she is allowed under the 
independent counsel act. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Department of Justice will have no comment today on the  
matter involving Harold Ickes,'' an official statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	There were some indications Friday that Reno might have turned  
down a counsel, but there was no confirmation of that. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno said Thursday that she is not bothered by Republican  
attacks on her decisions last year to reject independent counsels 
to investigate President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore over 
1996 campaign fund raising, nor by Democrats who have assailed her 
for appointing a record seven counsels. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only time I'm uncomfortable with myself is when I think  
I've not been as thorough as I could in terms of trying to 
understand what the issues are,'' Reno said. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno was viewed by aides as more likely to order a counsel to  
investigate the Ickes case than other recent campaign finance 
matters. 
</P>
<P>
	The allegation is that Ickes lied in a Sept. 22, 1997, Senate  
Governmental Affairs Committee deposition about Clinton 
administration efforts on behalf of the Teamsters union in a 1995 
strike against Diamond Walnut Co. The Teamsters had contributed to 
Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	Ickes has denied wrongdoing.  
</P>
<P>
	The Ickes case divided Reno's advisers more than usual, and much  
more than when she accepted overwhelming advice against counsels 
for Clinton and Gore, Justice officials said, requesting anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ickes case could move a major portion of the department's  
campaign finance investigation into the hands of an independent 
counsel, because Ickes played a central role in 1996 Democratic 
fund raising. Independent Counsel Carol Bruce volunteered to handle 
the Ickes matter if Reno seeks an independent inquiry, officials 
have said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bruce is already investigating alleged perjury by Interior  
Secretary Bruce Babbitt and whether an administration decision to 
block a casino was influenced by Democratic contributions from 
Indian tribes. Ickes played a role in the casino decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Justice aides, opposing an independent counsel, advised  
Reno that no perjury prosecution could be brought against Ickes 
based on the lone question about the Teamsters strike during the 
Senate deposition. They said the question was too imprecise for a 
perjury case and was not followed up with questions defining its 
terms. 
</P>
<P>
	The independent counsel act bars Reno from using such  
prosecutorial tools as sworn grand jury testimony at this stage. 
Other aides, supporting a counsel, contended that limitation 
prevented her from resolving whether further investigation was 
needed, particularly whether Ickes had criminal intent, as a 
perjury case requires. 
</P>
<P>
	When such questions remain unresolved, the attorney general must  
hand them to an independent counsel empowered to use all tools. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI renewed its long-standing recommendation for a counsel,  
citing an appearance of a conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, Ickes met with Teamsters leaders about the strike. A  
memo prepared for him noted the union gave $2.4 million to 
Democratic candidates in 1992 and suggested the administration 
consider helping on issues like the strike if it wanted continued 
support. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate panel asked: ``What did the administration do  
regarding the Diamond Walnut strike?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ickes responded: ``Nothing that I know of.''  
</P>
<P>
	According to a Teamsters memo, Ickes said he asked then-U.S.  
Trade Representative Mickey Kantor if he would urge Diamond Walnut 
to settle the strike. Ickes acknowledges asking Kantor to make a 
call. 
</P>
<P>
	Kantor says his call was not motivated by fund raising and the  
administration never tried to punish the company. Kantor said he 
merely asked the status of a possible settlement and applied no 
pressure. 
</P>
<P>
	A company executive testified there was no explicit threat but  
the company viewed the call as part of the Teamsters' effort. 
</P>
<P>
	Ickes' lawyers have said inquiries do not amount to executive  
action to end the strike.

<HEADLINE> Settlement Reached in Woodward Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- A settlement reached Friday between Louise  
Woodward and the family who sued her for the wrongful death of the 
8-month-old boy in her care prevents the former British au pair 
from profiting from selling her story. 
</P>
<P>
	``The goal of this case is what is was from the beginning, that  
Louise Woodward would not become a millionaire,'' said Fredric 
Ellis, the lawyer for Drs. Sunil and Deborah Eappen. ``The goal of 
this lawsuit was to use the civil justice system to accomplish 
something the criminal justice system couldn't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A jury found Ms. Woodward guilty last year of second-degree  
murder in the 1997 death of 8-month-old Matthew Eappen. But a judge 
reduced the conviction to manslaughter and she was released after 
serving 279 days in prison. She was allowed to return home to 
Elton, England, in June. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday's agreement stipulates that Ms. Woodward donate any money  
she gets from the case to the international children's charity 
UNICEF. If Ms. Woodward tries to keep any money herself, the 
Eappens would go to court to demand the money be given to a 
nonprofit foundation established in their baby's name. 
</P>
<P>
	Legal experts debated whether any ban on profits ordered by a  
U.S. court could be enforced in England. But Ellis said the 
confidential agreement is enforceable overseas because it was 
written in the form of a contract with the help of international 
legal experts. 
</P>
<P>
	``I entered into this completely voluntarily and it does seem  
like the right thing to do to, to settle once and for all and to 
put an end to it so that we can all get on with our lives and so I 
can carry on studying,'' Ms. Woodward said Friday in an interview 
with the British Broadcasting Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Woodward also said she still hopes to convince others of her  
innocence and that accepting the settlement does not imply 
liability for the baby's death. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will always maintain that I never hurt Matthew and I never  
killed Matthew,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal does not apply to Ms. Woodward's parents, Gary and  
Susan Woodward, who accepted a $60,000 payment from the Daily Mail, 
a British tabloid, after their daughter was first convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	The case began in February 1997 when Ms. Woodward, then 18 and  
caring for the Eappens' two young boys -- Matthew and his then 
2 1/2-year-old brother, Brendan -- called police to say the baby had 
stopped breathing. 
</P>
<P>
	Matthew was hospitalized in a coma and died five days later.  
Prosecutors said the infant had been shaken and his head violently 
smashed against a hard object. Ms. Woodward's lawyers argued that 
the injury happened weeks before he was hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
	The Eappens initially asked for several million dollars in  
compensatory and punitive damages. Ms. Woodward first ignored the 
civil suit and was found in default, and a federal judge said she 
would be liable for the damages. 
</P>
<P>
	But the judge later allowed a trial to determine how much Ms.  
Woodward should pay.

<HEADLINE> 2nd Evaluation for Shooting Suspect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The man accused of killing two U.S. Capitol  
police officers will spend the next 30 days undergoing a second 
psychiatric evaluation. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan on Thursday ordered the  
evaluation for Russell Weston, Jr. at the U.S. Medical Facility for 
Federal Prisoners at Springfield, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
	``The value of an inpatient evaluation over another outpatient  
evaluation is that trained staff, including psychiatrists, 
psychologists, nurses, ward staff, and correctional officers, will 
observe the defendant over thirty days,'' the judge wrote in a 
12-page order. 
</P>
<P>
	A court-appointed government psychiatrist who examined Weston in  
October and determined he was incompetent to stand trial and 
recommended indefinite hospitalization. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Sally Johnson, associate warden at the Federal Corrections  
Institute at Butner, N.C., also wrote the psychiatric report that 
argued Unabomber Theodore Kaczynski was mentally competent for 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Weston, 42, allegedly gunned down officers John Gibson and Jacob  
J. Chestnut in a corridor of the U.S. Capitol on July 24. 
</P>
<P>
	Sullivan said he was ordering the additional examination because  
Weston could face the death penalty if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge also rejected a prosecution request to videotape the  
new examination, but indicated he might reconsider the request 
based on the recommendations of the Bureau of Prisons or the 
government's expert. 
</P>
<P>
	Sullivan's ruling limits the scope of the examination to  
determining Weston's competency to stand trial on the charges in 
the six-count federal indictment. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to two counts of murder of a federal officer, Weston  
is charged with the attempted murder of U.S. Capitol Police Officer 
Douglas B. McMillan, and three counts of carrying and use of a 
firearm in a crime of violence.

<HEADLINE> Super Bowl Turf Pronounced Fine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- George Toma just wanted Greg Norman's grass to be  
green for the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't earlier this month.  
</P>
<P>
	It is now.  
</P>
<P>
	Toma, who has nurtured the turf for all 33 Super Bowls, worked  
around the clock the past three weeks to improve the look of the 
field at Pro Player Stadium for Sunday's game. 
</P>
<P>
	His tools: some 250 gallons of green dye, 40 pounds of rye grass  
seed and countless jugs of liquid manure. 
</P>
<P>
	By Friday, the turf had a nice lush color -- perfect for the  
NFL's signature event. 
</P>
<P>
	Gone are the unsightly patches that prompted Toma to call the  
field the ``second worst'' he's ever worked on, behind only the 
Rose Bowl for the 1984 Olympic soccer tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Not exactly words Norman wanted to hear.  
</P>
<P>
	Grown on the golfer's sod farm in Avon, Fla., the turf was found  
to have dollar spot disease when it arrived three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``In no way were we ripping the condition of the sod,'' Toma  
said. ``We're just saying that aesthetically, we had a problem with 
the sod.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Toma said he told Norman about the patches when the golfer  
inspected the field on Tuesday. Norman promised to look into the 
situation, and there were no hard feelings, Toma said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel bad. But nobody feels as bad about it as Greg Norman,''  
he said. ``He has pride and I have pride. It's just something that 
happened. Physically, it'll play good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the toughest sod I've seen in my 57 years on the job,''  
Toma added. ``I just want it to be green.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 69-year-old Toma is retired from the groundskeeping jobs he  
held at Arrowhead Stadium and Kauffman Stadium, homes of the Kansas 
City Chiefs and baseball's Royals. He's at the Super Bowl as a 
consultant, with son Chip supervising operations. 
</P>
<P>
	``On Sunday, the field's going to be great. When they see it,  
everybody's going to be amazed,'' Chip Toma said. 
</P>
<P>
	Landing the Super Bowl contract was considered a coup for the  
Greg Norman Turf Farm, which developed the strain that goes by the 
trade name GN-1. Developed by Joe Motz, it combines burlap and 
artificial-turf fibers to create a sturdy base for the grass, a mix 
of PHD rye and lesco.

<HEADLINE>  Inflation Fears in Brazil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- With inflation threatening a return  
performance, housewife Dora Inui isn't taking any chances. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of the one bag of beans she used to purchase in her  
weekly trips to a large Sao Paulo supermarket, she decides to throw 
six into the shopping cart ``before prices go up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ghost of inflation, long the scourge of Latin America's  
largest economy, is once again haunting Brazilians. 
</P>
<P>
	And the retail sector, led by supermarkets, has emerged as the  
exorcist, promising to drive away suppliers who want to raise their 
prices. Instead, retailers are pressing suppliers to prove higher 
prices are justified and demanding that any increased costs be 
negotiated. 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks ago, Brazil abruptly devalued its currency, the real,  
spelling the end of a 1994 economic stabilization program that 
successfully brought inflation down from nearly 3,000 percent a 
year to about 2 percent in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The real has since fallen by about 40 percent and  
pre-devaluation estimates that placed inflation at close to zero by 
the end of 1999 have now been revised to at least 10 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Although store prices still remain relatively stable, largely  
due to supplies purchased before the devaluation, retailers have 
moved quickly to prevent the return of the bad old days when price 
stickers were changed almost daily. 
</P>
<P>
	Back then, when monthly double-digit inflation figures were the  
rule, consumers would rush to supermarkets on payday and stock up 
on enough goods to last them a month. 
</P>
<P>
	``It used to be terrible,'' said Custodia Maria Rocha Oliveira,  
a proofreader at a publishing house. ``Our purchasing power would 
start withering away almost as soon as we received our wages.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Suppliers of a wide range of products, including flour, poultry,  
coffee, plastics and household appliances have used the devaluation 
to justify planned price hikes. 
</P>
<P>
	Many claim that as the buying power of the real sinks on world  
markets, pushing up prices for imported raw materials and 
components, they have been forced to increase consumer prices by as 
much as 30 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogerio Amato, a director of Eletros, an association of electric  
appliance manufacturers, said price increases in his sector were 
unavoidable because imported components account for 50 percent of 
production costs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are going to have to raise our prices,'' he said. 'There's  
no other way out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The devaluation, which makes it easier for Brazilian goods to  
compete on the basis of price in other countries, has also 
encouraged exports, something that could hurt Brazilian consumers. 
For example, coffee, poultry and orange juice producers are 
earmarking large parts of their production for the export market. 
</P>
<P>
	``This could result in shortages, which spells higher prices for  
the Brazilian consumer,'' said Pierre Brisset, research director of 
the French-owned Carrefour supermarket chain, Brazil's largest. 
</P>
<P>
	``The devaluation will inevitably lead to higher prices,'' he  
added. ``But many suppliers have presented us with new prices which 
are simply abusive, unacceptable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By abusive, he said he meant any ``double-digit increase.''  
</P>
<P>
	``Suppliers who increase their prices by more than 10 percent  
will have to justify themselves and show us their spreadsheets,'' 
Brisset said. ``If not, we will look for alternatives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pao de Acucar, Brazil's second-largest supermarket chain, has  
adopted the same stance. 
</P>
<P>
	``The retail sector has to be like a dike that is used to  
carefully control how much water can pass,'' said Pao de Acucar's 
commercial director Valdemar Machado. ``We will only buy from 
suppliers who negotiate and propose reasonable price increases.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Brazilian consumer, who enjoyed price stability during the  
Real Plan, will also help keep the lid on inflation, Brisset said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Consumers will no longer passively accept exorbitant price  
hikes,'' he said. ``They are more willing to do without certain 
items and brand loyalty has been replaced by price loyalty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Conceicao Aparecida dos Santos, a secretary in a law firm,  
agrees. 
</P>
<P>
	``Prices continue the same,'' she said as she reaches for a  
package of her favorite spaghetti. ``But if they go up I'll look 
for another cheaper brand. I have to worry about my pocketbook, not 
their's.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	Thunderstorms rumbled along the Gulf Coast early today as cold  
air funneled into the southern Plains and a snowstorm lumbered 
toward New Mexico. Skies were clearing across the Northeast. 
</P>
<P>
	The storm system hanging over the southern Plains could bring up  
to a foot of snow across areas of eastern New Mexico, as well as 
the panhandles of Texas and Oklahoma. Wind gusts could produce 
snowdrifts as high as 3 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Along the Gulf Coast, this storm system could produce rain and  
scattered thunderstorms from Oklahoma and Texas as far east as 
Tennessee and Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
	The strongest storms, near the Gulf of Mexico, could be  
accompanied by hail and strong wind gusts and could spawn tornadoes 
in Louisiana and Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
	Mostly clear skies were moving back into the Northeast, with  
ample sunshine in the forecast across most areas of northern New 
England. 
</P>
<P>
	Fair and mild conditions were forecast over the Ohio Valley,  
west through the Great Lakes and across the northern Plains. 
</P>
<P>
	A storm system in the Pacific Northwest could produce strong  
wind gusts and clouds into the northern Rockies, with more blustery 
rain heading for coastal areas of Washington and Oregon. Flooding 
was possible along creeks and streams and in places where the 
ground is saturated. 
</P>
<P>
	Elevations above 4,000 feet could get heavy snow from this  
system, which could drop another foot of snow in the Cascades. 
Whiteout conditions from blowing snow were possible. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunshine should be abundant across southern California.  
</P>
<P>
	Bitter cold was spreading across Alaska, and forecasters don't  
expect a break in the deep freeze until early next week. 
</P>
<P>
	The hot spot Thursday in the lower 48 states was Sarasota, Fla.,  
with a high of 82 degrees. The coldest place was Clayton Lake, 
Maine, with a low of 25 below zero. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's temperatures should range from the teens in northern New  
England to the 80s in Florida, with readings into the 30s for the 
Great Lakes, northern Plains and panhandles of Oklahoma and Texas; 
the 40s across the Northeast, Northwest and Ohio Valley; the 40s 
and 50s for the Midwest; the 50s in northern California and the 
mid-Atlantic; and the 60s and 70s in the desert Southwest and the 
South.

<HEADLINE> CNN Appeals to Senators Over Debate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- CNN formally appealed to the Senate on Friday to  
open its impeachment deliberations, arguing that closing the doors 
to the public was an affront to the First Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate twice went into secret session this week, once to  
debate a motion by Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., to dismiss the 
impeachment articles against President Clinton and again to discuss 
whether to call witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	CNN made its argument in the form of a brief written by First  
Amendment lawyer Floyd Abrams and delivered Friday to all 100 
senators and through full-page newspaper ads printed in USA Today, 
the Los Angeles Times and The Washington Post. 
</P>
<P>
	``Conducting these debates behind closed doors denies people  
throughout the world the opportunity to judge the fairness of the 
proceedings and excludes firsthand information from being made 
available to the millions of American voters who have a vital stake 
in the trial's outcome,'' CNN argued in its ad. 
</P>
<P>
	CNN considered filing a lawsuit but concluded that since the  
Senate makes its own rules on the impeachment proceedings, no court 
would have jurisdiction, Abrams said. 
</P>
<P>
	The network wanted to add a legal argument to buttress the  
efforts of Sens. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, and Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., 
to open the proceedings, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate voted 57-43 to keep debate over Byrd's motion secret.  
All except three Republicans favored the secret session and all 
except five Democrats, including Byrd, were opposed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate locked its doors and posted guards when it went into  
secret session, and members were threatened with expulsion if they 
disclose what went on. Deliberations in the impeachment trial of 
President Andrew Johnson in 1868 were also kept confidential, and 
closed sessions have routinely been held in impeachment proceedings 
against federal judges. 
</P>
<P>
	Abrams argued that the Johnson case should not be used as  
precedent, since First Amendment law on freedom of the press has 
largely been established in the 20th Century. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope the senators will pay close heed to their obligations  
to the Constitution,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Brian Lamb, CEO of C-SPAN, sought to rally the news media to  
this cause in late December and said he was disappointed that more 
voices didn't join him. He said many senators are disingenuous in 
fighting to keep proceedings closed yet frequently making 
themselves available for television interviews. 
</P>
<P>
	Lamb called CNN's effort a good step, but said senators listen

<HEADLINE> Indian Tribe Seeks Federal Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ONONDAGA INDIAN NATION, N.Y. (AP) -- The Onondaga Indian tribe  
has asked the federal government to investigate decades of 
environmental problems the tribe says have plagued their 
reservation in upstate New York. 
</P>
<P>
	A petition filed Wednesday asked the Environmental Protection  
Agency to review a state permit for a gravel mine at the headwaters 
of Onondaga Creek, a waterway ``essential to the Onondagas' 
religion, culture and community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Onondagas also asked the state to suspend the mining permit  
it issued in October 1996 to Valley Realty Development Co. 
</P>
<P>
	The Onondagas filed the petition with the EPA under a 1994  
presidential executive order directing federal agencies to focus on 
environmental and human health conditions that may 
disproportionately affect minority and low-income residents, 
including Native Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	The request for an environmental justice investigation is the  
first by an Indian nation in New York and only the third 
nationally, said Joseph Heath, the nation's counsel. 
</P>
<P>
	``The nation is not looking for financial compensation,'' Heath  
said. ``We want this destructive activity stopped.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In recent years, the Onondagas have dealt with a dump fire, a  
leaching automobile junk yard and a major gasoline spill, among 
other problems. 
</P>
<P>
	William Gilberti, an attorney representing Valley Realty, said  
the Onondagas' complaints were groundless. He said the mine was 
operating in full compliance with state environmental standards.

<HEADLINE> New Fishing Restrictions Passed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- After months of debate, the New England Fishery  
Management Council has leveled sweeping restrictions on fishing in 
hopes of saving the cod, once a cornerstone of the industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The council voted Thursday to slash the daily cod catch in the  
Gulf of Maine from 400 pounds per boat to 200 pounds and to ban 
fishing within 30 miles of shore off parts of the coast from Maine 
to the top of Cape Cod Bay. That would include the New Hampshire 
coast. 
</P>
<P>
	The restrictions would ban all gear capable of catching  
groundfish, including cod and flounder. Scallopers and lobstermen 
are exempt from the ban. The new limits will be phased in starting 
in May, pending approval from the federal Commerce Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisherman said the changes could cost thousands of people their  
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there are varying degrees of death, this is one of them,''  
said Paul Cohan, president of the Gulf of Maine Fishermen's 
Alliance. 
</P>
<P>
	The restricted area will be divided into four sections to be  
closed one at a time on a rolling basis in May, June, October and 
November, said Teri Frady, a spokeswoman for the National Marine 
Fisheries Service. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past, restrictions have been imposed to rebuild stocks in  
the fishing area between Cape Cod and the tip of Maine. 
</P>
<P>
	But after scientists in December released a report that the cod  
population was at its lowest in 30 years, the council determined 
that the cod catch should be cut by 80 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Faced with the loss of their livelihood, dozens of fishermen  
testified for hours Thursday about what severe cutbacks could mean. 
Five police officers were called in to stand guard at the hearing 
in a Portsmouth, N.H., hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've been paid to be here -- we haven't,'' yelled Paul  
Germaine, a cod fisherman. ``We've lost money being here, and now 
we're going to leave with nothing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the fishermen said the closures would hurt fishermen  
from Massachusetts and New Hampshire with smaller boats, but would 
go easier on those from Maine, who have larger ships and can fish 
farther out at sea. 
</P>
<P>
	The restrictions could prompt regional economic losses ranging  
from $19.9 million to $21.8 million, according to an estimate in a 
draft analysis completed this week. 
</P>
<P>
	As many as 2,500 fishermen could be out of work and 700 boats  
could be grounded, according to an estimate from Sen. Edward 
Kennedy, D-Mass.

<HEADLINE> Baptist Trial Explores Phony List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LARGO, Fla. (AP) -- A company that paid $400,000 to market life  
insurance to the National Baptist Convention USA's black members 
ended up sending letters to non-Baptists, including a Ku Klux Klan 
grand dragon, an executive testified Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was the quickest and most negative response that I have  
ever received in my 27 years of direct marketing,'' George Burke, 
vice president of marketing for Globe Accident and Life Insurance 
Co., said in the racketeering trial of the Rev. Henry Lyons, 
convention president. 
</P>
<P>
	The KKK leader sent the package back marked in red ink.  
</P>
<P>
	``He did not appreciate receiving this mailing,'' Burke said.  
</P>
<P>
	Lyons and Bernice Edwards, his alleged mistress, are charged  
with racketeering. They are accused of faking membership figures to 
swindle more than $4 million from companies to buy fancy cars, 
expensive jewelry and classy homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorneys say Lyons merely made bad business deals and  
is being blamed for failing to raise enough money for his church 
group. 
</P>
<P>
	Globe, a direct mail company based in Oklahoma City, paid $1  
million based on Lyons' claim that the convention had 8.5 million 
members, former Globe marketing official Robert Richey testified. 
Globe was given two phony mailing lists of convention members 
before Lyons admitted there was no such list, Richey said, calling 
the deal ``a disaster.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons also is charged with grand theft, accused of stealing  
$250,000 the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith donated to 
rebuild burned black churches in the South. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons faces another trial this spring on federal charges.

<HEADLINE> Traffic Biggest Hurdle in Car Event </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Winning the Rolex 24 is the ultimate  
goal. Surviving is the first priority. 
</P>
<P>
	The premier 24-hour sports car race in the United States begins  
Saturday with about 80 cars taking the green flag for the 
twice-around-the-clock classic at Daytona International Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just getting through the early hours is so important,'' said  
Didier Theys, who was part of the winning MOMO Ferrari team last 
year and will start another Ferrari from the outside of the front 
row Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Speed, of course, is important,'' the Belgian said. ``The pace  
of this race gets faster almost every year as the equipment gets 
better and more reliable. But, still, you must save something for 
the final hours -- if you are still running.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Theys will co-drive the open-cockpit Ferrari 333SP with two-time  
Indianapolis 500 winner Arie Luyendyk, Mauri Baldi of Italy and 
team-owner Fredy Lienhart of Switzerland. All but Lienhart were 
part of the winning team last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We fit together very well,'' Theys said. ``We respect each  
other's driving (ability) and there is not a lot of ego. This can 
be a very hard race, but we have a good time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last January, their Ferrari won by eight laps on the 3.56-mile,  
11-turn road circuit that uses about three-quarters of the 
2.5-mile, high-banked NASCAR oval and a surpentine infield section. 
</P>
<P>
	Also among the contenders this weekend will be the team's other  
Ferrari, co-piloted by CART stars Jimmy Vasser and Max Papis, 
former Indy-car and Formula One regular Stefan Johansson and Jim 
Matthews. 
</P>
<P>
	Should either or both of the Ferraris get to the final hours  
Sunday, their most likely competition will come from the two Dyson 
Racing Riley &AMP; Scott Fords. 
</P>
<P>
	James Weaver of England put one of those cars on the pole  
Thursday with a lap of 127.05 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Weaver, who will share the car with team owner Rob Dyson, Dorsey  
Schroeder and Stuart Hayner, said, ``It's going to be a very fast 
race and you have to be very aware of what's going on every minute. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the easiest race to lose of anyplace in the world  
because there's so many cars in it. It's very exciting and very 
easy to make a mistake with all that traffic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The race will feature cars from all four U.S. Road Racing  
Championship divisions, led by the Can-Am cars and including GT1, 
GT2 and GTT. 
</P>
<P>
	``The speed differential is amazing,''said former Indy 500  
winner Danny Sullivan, who will co-drive a Riley &AMP; Scott Ford with 
five-time Rolex winner Hurley Haywood and former Indy-car racers 
Don and Dale Whittington. ``It's almost like playing a video racing 
game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although the overall speed difference is only about 20 mph, the  
speed on the fastest portion of the course -- the high banks -- can 
differ by as much as 50 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only thing that slows this race is because it's so long  
and because of the traffic,'' Dyson said. ``The traffic separates 
the intelligent, reasonable and responsible drivers from the rest. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to maintain a very steady, strong pace, but at the  
same time be safe in traffic. It's a very fine line.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Weaver said, ``Some of the guys out there aren't using their  
heads so far. I hope that changes in the race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One thing that will be different about this season-opening  
Daytona event is the lights. In the past, only the area along the 
front straightaway grandstand was lighted, then only dimly. 
</P>
<P>
	A $10 million lighting system that was installed last year to  
illuminate the oval for the NASCAR Pepsi 400, will be used at 20 
percent power, maintaining some of the ambiance of traditional 
night racing but allowing the spectators to identify car numbers 
and colors rather than just seeing moving lights for most of each 
lap. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the veterans of this event would have preferred the  
dark. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would love to run dark with headlights,'' former race winner  
Elliott Forbes-Robinson said. ``That's cool. But, if it makes it 
better for the fans, that's more important.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's quite an improvement,'' Luyendyk said. ``But the (lack  
of) lights never bothered me. Besides, where you need more light, 
in the infield, it doesn't shine much on that.''

<HEADLINE> Researcher Finds Evidence of Ancient Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Danish researcher analyzing rock formations  
from Greenland said he has found chemical evidence that suggests 
the presence of life 3.7 billion years ago, about 200 million years 
before the earliest known fossils. 
</P>
<P>
	Minik T. Rosing of the Geologisk Museum in Denmark reports in  
Friday's edition of the journal Science that metamorphic rock in a 
well-preserved sedimentary deposit in western Greenland contains 
carbon of the type that might have come from plankton that lived in 
the sea. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosing said that the carbon chemistry is similar to what is  
deposited in modern marine sediments by present day plankton, a 
one-celled animal that lives near the ocean surface. 
</P>
<P>
	The rock formation has been age-dated at 3.7 billion years. This  
means that if the carbon was biological in origin, then it could 
have come from life forms that died and settled to the bottom some 
200 million years before the first known fossils. 
</P>
<P>
	Plankton that lives near the ocean surface could have settled to  
the bottom, decomposed in the mud, leaving behind traces of their 
carbon chemistry, the researcher said. The mud eventually could 
have hardened into the rock that was analyzed by Rosing.

<HEADLINE> Sunday School Class on Gays Planned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Sunday school lessons on how homosexuals  
can ``change'' will be offered to adults at many Southern Baptist 
churches for the first time this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope through this lesson that people would see an open door  
for all sinners and come and have a changed life through Jesus 
Christ,'' said Ross McLaren, who worked on the lessons. 
</P>
<P>
	McLaren, a biblical studies specialist at Lifeway Christian  
Resources, the publishing arm of the 15.6-million-member Southern 
Baptist Convention, said the lessons aim to condemn homosexuality 
but not homosexuals. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Turner, co-chairman of the Lesbian and Gay Coalition for  
Justice in Tennessee, said he finds the idea of ``hate the sin but 
love the sinner'' patronizing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know plenty of lesbian and gay Christians who are quite  
convinced that they have a perfectly adequate relationship with God 
and are still gay,'' said Turner, adding he is not contesting the 
right of Southern Baptists to teach what they want. 
</P>
<P>
	``The problem is imposing that doctrine on the rest of the  
culture,'' Turner said, citing the Southern Baptist boycott of 
Disney for its corporate practice of extending health insurance to 
homosexual partners of employees and hosting homosexuals at its 
amusement parks. 
</P>
<P>
	Southern Baptist lessons have touched on homosexuality in the  
past, but McLaren said Sunday will be the first time it is the sole 
focus. 
</P>
<P>
	Other lessons have focused on abortion, pornography and justice  
-- aiming to treat all people with fairness and dignity. 
</P>
<P>
	Lifeway staffers select topics independent of the convention  
headquarters and it is up to individual churches to decide if they 
want to use them. About 1.5 million series handbooks were sold to 
churches. 
</P>
<P>
	The lessons characterize homosexuality as unnatural and sinful.  
Homosexuals are encouraged to change and heterosexual Christians 
are asked to help them. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the lessons list additional readings on ``healing''  
homosexuals and suggestions for further reading.

<HEADLINE> Fox Criticizes MSNBC for North Hire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- If they ever run out of on-screen political  
battles at the cable news networks, they can always turn the 
cameras around. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox News Channel's top executive chided rival MSNBC on Thursday,  
accusing its executives of tilting conservative in response to a 
ratings slump by deciding to hire talk show host Oliver North. 
</P>
<P>
	North and liberal commentator Cynthia Alksne will run ``Equal  
Time'' weeknights at 8 p.m. EST, followed by veteran correspondent 
John McLaughlin's political roundtable at 8:30. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox News Channel Chairman Roger Ailes said MSNBC is ``left  
wing'' and North and McLaughlin help balance it politically. Fox 
has been rising in the ratings lately, with an average prime-time 
audience of 218,000 households to MSNBC's 200,000 during the first 
three weeks of January. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they think it would save them, they'd be hiring people from  
Lyndon LaRouche,'' said Ailes, a former Republican political 
strategist and campaign adviser to Presidents Nixon, Reagan and 
Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	Erik Sorenson, vice president and general manager of MSNBC, said  
the network wasn't trying to change political stripes. He said 
MSNBC strives to be balanced and wants provocative talk from all 
sides. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess Roger can't stop running for office,'' he said.  
``We're not running a political campaign. We're just trying to get 
people to watch our network.'' 
</P>
<P>
	People at Fox News Channel ``cater to Clinton haters'' who love  
the impeachment story, Sorenson said. MSNBC is more interested in 
building its network long term and is chasing CNN instead of 
worrying about Fox, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	MSNBC received its own criticism last year from former talk show  
host Keith Olbermann, who said it was spending too much time on the 
Clinton scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	For his part, North said he's glad that MSNBC is giving  
conservatives like him a chance to speak their mind. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think what they are doing is reaching out to try to balance  
what is perceived to be a liberal perspective,'' the former Marine 
lieutenant colonel and key figure in the Iran Contra scandal said 
in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
	North called back later to say, however, that he didn't know the  
motives of MSNBC executives in hiring him and that he believed the 
network presented a balanced political perspective. 
</P>
<P>
	As for his show, North said, expect some fireworks with Alksne.  
</P>
<P>
	``Part of our contract is we've agreed not to throw things at  
each other,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Push Ahead; Dow Up 44.54 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were higher this afternoon after wobbling  
this morning, as technology shares bounced backed from their early 
lows and investors refocused on a morning report showing continued 
strength in the U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
	At 3 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
up 44.54 at 9,325.87. The blue-chip index rose 49 points in the 
first minutes of trading, then dropped to negative 57 points before 
recovering. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the gain in thie Dow, advancing issues were barely  
leading decliners on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came 
to 723 million shares, up from Thursday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were mostly higher after an early  
morning selloff. The technology-laden Nasdaq composite index was up 
21.29 at 2,498.63, surpassing a new closing high set just Thursday. 
The Nasdaq is up more than 13 percent this year, compared with only 
a 1 percent gain in the Dow. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 
7.27 at 1,272.64. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks opened higher as investors cheered the Commerce  
Department's report showing a better-than-expected 5.6 percent rise 
in fourth-quarter gross domestic product. 
</P>
<P>
	For all of 1998, GDP -- the total of goods and services produced  
within the United States -- increased by 3.9 percent, following an 
identical increase in 1997 and a healthy 3.4 percent rise in 1996. 
That made the three-year period the economy's most robust run of 
growth since 1984-86. 
</P>
<P>
	But the market's gains quickly disappeared with the release of a  
report from the Purchasing Management Association of Chicago that 
showed manufacturing declined in the Midwest in January. 
</P>
<P>
	Also pressuring stocks early today was a slump in technology  
shares, which fell on profit taking. 
</P>
<P>
	By midday, however, the buyers were back in the market looking  
for deals on technology stocks, and attention was again focused on 
the positive GDP report. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market right now is sending a lot of mixed signals,'' said  
Brian Belski, chief investment strategist at George K. Baum &AMP; Co. 
in Kansas City. ``Everyone is reading too much into everything and 
we aren't sure of our next step.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 1.09 percent,  
Germany's DAX index rose 2 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 rose 0.4 
percent, and France's CAC-40 rose up 1.2 percent.

<HEADLINE> Stocks End Higher; Dow Up 77.50 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rose in heavy trading Friday, pushing the  
Nasdaq and Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 lists to new highs, on fresh 
evidence of strong economic growth and as an unexpectedly strong 
round of quarterly earnings reports was winding down. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks gained 77.50 to  
9,358.83, closing up 238.16 for the week. The blue-chip index swung 
widely throughout the session, adding 49 points in the first 
minutes of trading, then dropping to negative 57 points before 
recovering. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow is still 285 points below its all-time closing high of  
9,643.32, set on Jan. 8, but it is up almost 2 percent on the year 
at the end of the first month of trading in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not a runaway gain for stocks, however, with advancing  
issues barely leading decliners on the New York Stock Exchange, 
where composite volume reached 1.10 billion shares, up slightly 
from Thursday's 1.03 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology stocks were among the big winners. The  
technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index rose 28.55 to 2,505.89, 
beating Thursday's record. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 composite rose 14.27 to 1,279.64, its  
first new high since Jan. 8. The American Stock Exchange's market 
value index rose 0.93 to 714.86. The Russell 2000 index of 
mid-sized companies rose 3.25 to 427.22. 
</P>
<P>
	The market got an early boost with a Commerce Department report  
of a better-than-expected 5.6 percent rise in the gross domestic 
product in the fourth quarter, accompanied by the lowest inflation 
rate in decades. 
</P>
<P>
	For all of 1998, GDP -- the total of goods and services produced  
within the United States -- increased by 3.9 percent, following an 
identical increase in 1997 and a healthy 3.4 percent rise in 1996. 
That made the three-year period the economy's most robust run of 
growth since 1984-86. 
</P>
<P>
	The strong GDP data surprised even the most conservative  
forecaster, said Hugh Johnson, chief market strategist at First 
Albany Corp. ``It's very clear that the economy, paced by consumer 
spending, is growing at a very strong pace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The GDP report was especially welcome because it showed that,  
while the economy is strong, inflation is at bay. A price index 
tied to the GDP rose 1 percent last year, the lowest rate since 
1959, when it also was 1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The surprising resilience of the economy makes it likely that  
Federal Reserve policy-makers won't lower interest rates again at a 
meeting next week. But with inflation under control, there also is 
no pressure on the Fed to put on the brakes by raising rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The day's gains were not steady.  
</P>
<P>
	Prices retreated at midmorning, when the Purchasing Management  
Association of Chicago reported that manufacturing declined in the 
Midwest in January. Also pressuring stocks early in the session was 
a slump in technology shares, as traders sold to take profits on 
recent dramatic gains. 
</P>
<P>
	By midday, however, the buyers were back in the market looking  
for deals and attention was again focused on the positive GDP 
report. 
</P>
<P>
	As the quarterly barrage of earnings reports neared its end,  
there continued to be positive surprises to lift shares. 
</P>
<P>
	Amgen Inc. rose 8 1/4 to 127 13/16 after a strong fourth-quarter  
earnings report, released Thursday after the close of trading, 
prompted a number of ratings upgrades. 
</P>
<P>
	Airline stocks rose on the prospect of the first industrywide  
fare increase in 18 months. Significantly, Northwest Airlines, 
which thwarted a move to higher fares last September, matched 
higher fares Friday. Its shares shot up 4 1/8 to 27 3/8 in Nasdaq 
trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology stocks blazed higher. The Dow was led by IBM, which  
gained 4 5/8 to 183 1/4, and Hewlett-Packard, up 4 1/2 to 78 3/8. Dell Computer 
led the action in Nasdaq trading and gained 5 13/16 to 100. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer stocks also did well, a yellow flag to some analysts  
that portfolio managers were bulking up on recession-resistent 
names, perhaps on the fear that the economy was about to top out. 
Dow component Procter &AMP; Gamble added 3 1/16 to 90 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
	In overseas trading, Tokyo's Nikkei index rose 1.09 percent, the  
DAX in Frankfurt added 1.25 percent, the FT-SE 100 in London rose 
0.40 percent, and the CAC in Paris climbed 1.24 percent.

<HEADLINE> Stocks End Higher; Dow Up 77.50 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks posted strong gains today after  
recovering from a wobbly morning, as technology shares bounced 
backed from their lows and investors refocused on a morning report 
showing continued strength in the U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
	At the close of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial  
average was up 77.50 points at 9,358.83. The blue-chip index rose 
49 points in the first minutes of trading, then dropped to negative 
57 points before recovering. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the gain in the Dow, advancing issues were barely  
leading decliners on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume was 
moderately heavy but up from Thursday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were mostly higher after an early  
morning selloff. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 rose 13.98 to 1,279.35, and the Nasdaq  
composite index rose 28.34 to 2,505.68. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by 1,386 to 1,377 on the  
New York Stock Exchange, with 600 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	NYSE volume totaled 906.93 million shares as of 4 p.m., vs.  
846.62 million in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index rose 5.04 to 600.44, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index rose 0.93 to 714.86. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 3.24 to 427.21.  
</P>
<P>
	Stocks opened higher as investors cheered the Commerce  
Department's report showing a better-than-expected 5.6 percent rise 
in fourth-quarter gross domestic product. 
</P>
<P>
	For all of 1998, GDP -- the total of goods and services produced  
within the United States -- increased by 3.9 percent, following an 
identical increase in 1997 and a healthy 3.4 percent rise in 1996. 
That made the three-year period the economy's most robust run of

<P>
	But the market's gains quickly disappeared with the release of a

</P>
<P>
	Also pressuring stocks early today was a slump in technology  
shares, which fell on profit taking. 
</P>
<P>
	By midday, however, the buyers were back in the market looking  
for deals on technology stocks, and attention was again focused on 
the positive GDP report. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market right now is sending a lot of mixed signals,'' said  
Brian Belski, chief investment strategist at George K. Baum &AMP; Co. 
in Kansas City. ``Everyone is reading too much into everything and 
we aren't sure of our next step.''

<HEADLINE> Court: Korda Can Keep Playing Tennis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Petr Korda, the 1998 Australian Open champion, can  
keep playing despite testing positive for steroids, a High Court 
judge ruled Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge said that the International Tennis Federation cannot  
contest an appeals panel ruling that allowed Korda to escape 
suspension over a drug test at Wimbledon last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The ITF, which was criticized for not suspending Korda for a  
year in accordance with its rules, said it would appeal the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	Calling the ruling ``disappointing,'' the ITF's executive  
medical director, Deborah Jevans, said the case had come down to 
legal technicalities. 
</P>
<P>
	The ITF will contest the ruling at the civil Court of Appeal in  
London, probably within a month. That means Korda can continue 
playing against a backdrop of criticism and might wind up playing 
against some players who have said he should be suspended. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, an independent appeal committee appointed by the ITF  
said Korda was guilty of a drug offense. He tested positive for 
Nandrolone after his quarterfinal Wimbledon loss to Tim Henman in 
July. 
</P>
<P>
	But the panel cited ``exceptional circumstances,'' and said  
Korda should not be banned because he did not know how the drug got 
into his system. 
</P>
<P>
	Under pressure from players and sports organizations, the ITF  
appealed the decision and said it planned to take the case to the 
Court of Arbitration for Sport in Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
	That prompted Korda to take the case to the High Court. He  
wasn't present at the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Korda's attorney, Charles Flint, said the ITF, under its  
anti-drug program, had no legal right to appeal the decision, which 
was ``final and binding'' on both sides. 
</P>
<P>
	Flint said the ITF's own anti-drug program ``is designed to  
provide for speedy and final determination of disputes as to 
allegations of doping before an independent expert committee.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Korda's case, he said, the code worked exactly as it was  
supposed to. ``We say a player should not be required to defend 
himself twice,'' Flint told the judge. 
</P>
<P>
	The ITF argued that any decision was only final if not appealed.  
</P>
<P>
	``I accordingly hold that the ITF is not entitled to appeal to  
the CAS and that Mr. Korda is entitled to a declaration to this 
effect,'' the judge, Sir Gavin Lightman, said. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Australian Open in Melbourne, several players spoke out  
strongly against Korda, saying he should have been suspended. Korda 
lost in the third round to Todd Martin.

<HEADLINE> Mistrial Called in Jury Tamper Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- A mistrial was declared Friday in the case of a  
jury foreman charged with accepting nearly $500,000 for his vote in 
a major cocaine-smuggling case after jurors said they were ``at 
each other's throats.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge James Lawrence King dismissed the jury in  
the trial of Miguel ``Mike'' Moya. Prosecutors plan to retry the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors had contended that Moya took the money to vote  
innocent and persuade others to do the same in the trial of reputed 
drug kingpins Augusto ``Willie'' Falcon and Salvador ``Sal'' 
Magluta. The pair were acquitted in February 1996 of charges they 
smuggled 75 tons of cocaine from Colombia into the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Moya was charged with money laundering, witness tampering,  
conspiracy and bribery. His parents, Jose and Rafaela Moya, also 
were on trial on charges of money laundering, witness tampering and 
accessory. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors refused to comment, other than to say they plan to  
retry the Moya family on April 5. Moya still could face life in 
prison if convicted, and his parents still could be sentenced to a 
maximum of 62 1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors sent a note to the judge Thursday, after four days of  
deliberations, saying they couldn't reach a verdict. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are unable to come to a unanimous decision,'' jury foreman  
Carlo Hollis said in the note. ``We are at each other's throats ... 
HELP!!!'' 
</P>
<P>
	King asked jurors Friday if there was any chance of reaching a  
verdict. They said no. 
</P>
<P>
	Moya's attorney Paul McKenna said he will ask on Tuesday for his  
client to be released on bond. Moya has been in solitary 
confinement in a federal detention center and his parents have been 
free on bond since they were indicted in September. 
</P>
<P>
	``A hung jury is a tie, not a victory,'' McKenna said. ``I'm  
heartened by the fact that some jurors accepted our defense and 
we're hopeful that we will prevail.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Falcon and Magluta reportedly made $2 billion profit smuggling  
cocaine during the 1980s. After they were acquitted, federal 
investigators began looking into the jury that cleared them. 
</P>
<P>
	About the same time, Moya's parents retired and began living in  
luxury. Moya and his parents paid for a home in the Florida Keys, a 
two-week vacation in Hawaii, season tickets to the Florida Marlins, 
tickets for the World Series, several Rolex watches, a sports car 
and a boat. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys for the Moya family said the family's wealth came not  
from any bribe but from a cousin, Ramon ``Ray'' Perez, a convicted 
drug smuggler and former Miami police officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Perez, who served four years in prison for drug trafficking,  
testified that he paid $385,000 to Moya and family members to 
deliver cocaine and $100,000 to store 880 pounds of the drug. 
</P>
<P>
	Falcon and Magluta were reputedly the top drug traffickers in  
the United States in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcon-Magluta jurors had deliberated for three days when  
they sent a note to the judge saying they were locked in a 
``personal conflict'' and ``could not reach a verdict.'' Hours 
later, they returned the acquittals. 
</P>
<P>
	The acquittals humiliated prosecutors. U.S. Attorney Kendall  
Coffey resigned after a newspaper reported he was under 
investigation by the Justice Department for allegedly biting a 
topless dancer on the arm the night after the verdict. 
</P>
<P>
	Falcon and Magluta are now imprisoned on lesser, unrelated  
charges.

<HEADLINE>  Gore Addresses World Economic Forum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAVOS, Switzerland (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore today proposed  
``broad and deep'' cuts in barriers to international farm trade and 
urged Japan to do more to help the world economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States will also do its part, he said, speaking at  
the World Economic Forum. President Clinton's 2000 budget, which 
will be sent to Congress next week, will propose ``significant new 
funding'' for relieving the debt of poor nations, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Especially in this time of turmoil, the United States cannot  
and will not take growth for granted,'' Gore told a select audience 
of political and business leaders. ``That is a course we hope other 
nations will follow as well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he said other countries would have to contribute to  
stimulating the world's economy and said the United States cannot 
be the only country to boost imports in economically turbulent 
times. 
</P>
<P>
	``The world looks to Japan to make some appropriate changes in  
the way it discharges its responsibilities as the second-largest 
economy in the world,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said some Japanese claim the world is pressing them to do too  
much, ``but Japan's economy has been stalled for seven years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Please,'' he said. ``We need your help to deal with this  
global economic crisis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also urged the European Union to ``press ahead with  
long-needed structural reforms'' and stimulate domestic demand to 
do its share to help end Asian economic troubles. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore noted that last week President Clinton backed moves for a  
new round of global trade negotiations to expand trade in services, 
manufacturing and farm products. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am especially hopeful that these trade talks will raise  
living standards for the world's farmers and ranchers,'' he said, 
announcing that the United States will call for ``broad and deep'' 
reductions in agricultural tariffs, which now average 40 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore, who arrived Thursday in the Swiss ski resort of Davos to  
speak to the 1,600 business, government and other leaders attending 
the forum, also is meeting on the sidelines with Russian Prime 
Minister Yevgeny Primakov, Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma and 
Swiss President Ruth Dreifuss. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, finance officials from Europe, Japan and the United  
States said they must work together to steer the world economy away 
from crisis but had trouble agreeing on specific measures. 
</P>
<P>
	There was discord on issues such as whether Japan is about to  
emerge from its economic malaise and whether currency controls 
would help or harm global financial stability. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said he opposed calls  
by Japan and several European countries for coordination by the 
world's seven wealthiest nations to try to limit currency 
fluctuations. 
</P>
<P>
	Summers said recent financial crises ``had much more to do with  
domestic capital flight than it did with the behavior of external 
speculators.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eisuke Sakakibara, Japan's vice minister of finance, predicted  
that Japan's economy will bottom out by the middle of this year. 
``Financial panic ... is about to be over,'' he claimed. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Summers -- whose remarks are closely watched by market  
insiders because of their bearing on the value of the dollar -- 
expressed skepticism over a Japanese rebound this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we need to wait before we declare victory'' in Japan,  
he said. Success depends on how changes to Japan's regulatory and 
tax systems are carried through, he added.

<HEADLINE> Will LT Make the Hall of Fame? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Now that Lawrence Taylor has Paul Tagliabue's  
endorsement, will he get the necessary official votes to get into 
the Hall of Fame? 
</P>
<P>
	That decision comes today when a 36-man committee will vote in  
at least four candidates for the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 
Canton, Ohio. Induction ceremonies are scheduled for July 31. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he should,'' be in the Hall, Tagliabue said. ``And I  
say that without qualification. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Hall is about performance on the field. Lawrence was one  
of the greatest players ever; he changed the way the game is 
played. I think the public understands that by making a judgment on 
what he did on the field, you're not judging what he did off it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor, star linebacker for the New York Giants from 1981-93, is  
the lone controversial nominee. He went through a series of 
drug-related arrests and one suspension during his career, and some 
voters have indicated that would preclude them from voting for him. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the consequences for my choices are not being in the Hall  
of Fame, you guys decide that,'' Taylor told the media Monday. 
``I'm not losing sleep on whether I make it or not. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, I would love to be in there. I expect to be in there. I  
think I have worked hard enough to be in there. But yes, I have had 
problems in my life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Will he have problems getting into the Hall? Taylor needs 29  
votes to make it, and it could be close. 
</P>
<P>
	Also on the ballot are running back Eric Dickerson, who ran for  
a record 2,105 yards in 1984 and wound up third on the career 
rushing list with 13,259; defensive end Carl Eller, a key component 
of Minnesota's Purple People Eaters who was on 10 division winners; 
tackle Ron Yary, a standout blocker for the Vikings for 14 seasons; 
Oakland's Ray Guy, who led the NFL in punting three times; 
defensive ends Jack Youngblood, who starred in the 1970s and early 
'80s, and Howie Long, a fearsome pass-rusher and run-stopper of the 
1980s and early '90s. 
</P>
<P>
	Receivers Lynn Swann and John Stallworth, teammates with the  
great Pittsburgh teams of the 1970s, also are among the 15 
finalists. So are guards Billy Shaw, who played with Buffalo in the 
1960s, and Tom Mack, an 11-time Pro Bowler for the Rams. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Grant Fighting Way to Top </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) -- Some call Michael Grant the future of  
the heavyweight division. But Grant, who puts his unbeaten record 
on the line Saturday night, is in no hurry to get to the top. 
</P>
<P>
	``A patient spirit is a good spirit. I'm not in a rush,'' said  
Grand, who will fight Ahmad Abdin. ``I've always said I'd like 
Lennox (Lewis), but whoever's got the belt, I'll fight them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Grant, a chiseled 6-foot-7-inch native of Chicago fighting out  
of Norristown, Pa., has won all 28 of his fights since turning pro 
in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, he stopped David Izon in five rounds and Obed  
Sullivan in nine. He was scheduled to fight September, but he 
couldn't because he came down with hepatitis. 
</P>
<P>
	He weighed in at 250 pounds his fight for the vacant NABF title  
against Abdin, of Houston, 243. 
</P>
<P>
	In the co-feature, Andrew Golota will take on 41-year-old  
journeyman Jesse Ferguson, a substitute for Jimmy Thunder, who 
suffered an Achilles tendon injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Ferguson, who is 26-17, has won six of his last seven fights,  
including a 10-round decision over Sullivan last month. Golota, 
32-3, weighed in at 238 on Friday, Ferguson at 239. 
</P>
<P>
	The fights, in a 3,000-seat ballroom at Convention Hall, will be  
televised by HBO on its ``Boxing After Dark'' program.

<HEADLINE> Man Charged for Sending Hate E-mail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A man who e-mailed a death threat to Hispanic  
professors, students and officials across the country has agreed to 
plead guilty to federal charges, lawyers say. 
</P>
<P>
	Kingman Quon, 22, agreed to plead guilty to seven misdemeanors,  
U.S. Attorney Alejandro Mayorkas said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	This was the second federal prosecution of such a crime. The  
other case involved a Latin American student who aimed racist 
invective at Asian Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	Quon will plead guilty Feb. 8 to interfering with federally  
protected rights, specifically threatening to use force against his 
victims with the intent to intimidate or interfere with them 
because of their national origin or ethnic background, Mayorkas 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Quon, using a fictitious address, sent the same racially  
derogatory e-mail to 42 professors at California State University 
at Los Angeles, 25 students at Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology, employees of the National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration, Indiana University, the Xerox Corp., the Texas 
Hispanic Journal and the Internal Revenue Service, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	His lawyer, Joseph Gibbons Jr., said Quon has been a student at  
California State Polytechnic University, Pomona, although he is not 
attending this semester. 
</P>
<P>
	``He put a great deal of pressure on himself in terms of his  
class standing,'' Gibbons said. ``He does not have an inherent 
hatred of Latinos, but he seemed to snap under all the pressure he 
was placing on himself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He is scheduled to enter his pleas on Feb. 8. Because the seven  
charges against him are misdemeanors, the maximum possible sentence 
is seven years and a $700,000 fine. Under the negotiated plea 
agreement, Quon would serve about two-and-a-half years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	The only other hate e-mail prosecution involved Richard Machado,  
21, a naturalized citizen from El Salvador who flunked out of the 
University of California, Irvine. He was convicted of sending 
messages to 59 Asian students on campus, angry because their good 
grades were raising the standard for others on campus.

<HEADLINE> Bubby a Beautiful Buy for Broncos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- When the Denver Broncos entrusted their offense to  
backup quarterback Bubby Brister, tight end Shannon Sharpe, acting 
more like a nervous father, issued a warning: 
</P>
<P>
	``We're giving you the keys to the Ferrari, just don't wreck  
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brister slipped seamlessly behind the wheel and drove the  
Broncos' fine-tuned, high-octane machine without mishap. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, the super sub did what no quarterback other than John  
Elway could do in nine years -- win a game for the Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
	Since Gary Kubiak replaced an ailing Elway and engineered a win  
over Washington in 1989, the Broncos had gone 0-7 in games that 
Elway did not start. 
</P>
<P>
	An assortment of injuries to the 38-year-old Elway caused him to  
miss all or parts of six games this season, and Brister stepped 
confidently into the void. He went 4-0 in his four starts and also 
directed a comeback win in relief. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was just trying to earn my keep a little bit,'' the  
36-year-old Brister said. 
</P>
<P>
	When Elway left the third game of the season at Oakland with a  
hamstring injury in the second quarter, Brister threw a quick 
interception to put the Broncos behind but then orchestrated a 
come-from-behind win. 
</P>
<P>
	Elway missed the next two games, but Brister was brilliant in  
those two starts, completing a combined 32 for 53 passes for 383 
yards with six touchdowns and one interception in lopsided 
victories over Washington and Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	When Elway went down with a rib injury and missed two more games  
at mid-season, Brister completed 20 of 33 passes for 229 yards with 
two TDs and an interception to beat San Diego 27-10. Then he ran 38 
yards on a naked bootleg for a score in a 30-7 rout of Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
	``No dents, no dings,'' a beaming Sharpe said.  
</P>
<P>
	Of course, this luxury car comes fully loaded with all the  
options, including 2,000-yard rusher Terrell Davis, a prolific 
receiving corps, one of the NFL's best offensive lines, a 
run-stuffing defense and special teams that are truly special. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since I've been here, it's like I've died and gone to football  
heaven,'' Brister said. ``I'm just glad I got to experience a team 
like this before my day is done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brister knows the other, darker side of football, too.  
</P>
<P>
	Walter Andrew Brister III, given the nickname Bubby by his five  
older sisters, spent his first seven NFL seasons in Pittsburgh, 
four of them as a full-time starter. Then came two seasons in 
Philadelphia and a purgatorial season with the New York Jets in 
1995 that was so depressing he spent the next year out of football. 
</P>
<P>
	He used that idle year to help care for his father, who was  
diagnosed with prostate cancer that is now in remission. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought my career might be over,'' Brister said. ``When  
you're out of the game like I was, you appreciate it more. I felt 
like I could still run and throw and help somebody win. I wanted to 
play again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Broncos linebacker Bill Romanowski, who had played with Brister  
in Philadelphia, recommended him to Broncos coach Mike Shanahan 
prior to the 1997 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't want to play anywhere but here, really,'' Brister  
said. ``I talked to a couple of teams. I talked to the Bears, and 
thank God that didn't work out. But I knew Romanowski and I knew 
John. I had a feeling they had a chance to win a Super Bowl. I was 
really hoping I'd get to land here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Broncos are glad he did.  
</P>
<P>
	After playing sparingly in 1997, Brister completed 78 of 131  
passes this season for 986 yards, 10 touchdowns and three 
interceptions, earning a passer rating of 99.0 that was higher than 
Elway's 93.0. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know people were wondering about me,'' he said. ``They  
hadn't won a game in nine years without John being the starter. So 
it was a good feeling, especially being out of football for a 
while, to prove I could still get the job done if I have the 
supporting cast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like every backup, he's prepared to replace Elway at any minute,  
but hopes he doesn't have to play in Sunday's Super Bowl ``except 
to kneel down to kill the clock at the end of the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Elway retires after this game, Brister is eager to be the  
heir apparent, despite the fact he will be 37 next season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody is going to fill John Elway's shoes. Ever,'' Brister  
said. ``But I feel like I have the experience and I've played well 
enough this year to maybe be the front-runner if he does decide to 
leave. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like I can get it done for a year or two and let them  
develop our two young guys (Jeff Lewis and Brian Griese). They're 
both going to be great players. My main goal is to fend them off 
for a while.''

	Hungry Survivors Loot Market  
</P>
<P>
	ARMENIA, Colombia (AP) -- Hundreds of hungry survivors of this  
week's earthquake looted a central market and a Red Cross relief 
center today. Military police tried to halt the pillage with tear 
gas and live ammunition. At least two people were wounded, 
apparently by gunfire. Uptown, at the Red Cross center, scores of 
hungry homeless lost patience with eight-hour lines and bureaucracy 
and sacked the place.

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon is fashioning a plan for how the  
military would intervene in a biological or chemical attack on the 
United States. Defense Secretary William Cohen favors the 
appointment of a senior officer to coordinate the use of troops, a 
senior Pentagon official said. President Clinton, citing the 
likelihood of a domestic incident involving chemical or biological 
weapons, said last week the federal government needs to be better 
prepared for how to respond.

</P>
<P>
	ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) -- A federal judge today ordered some  
material kept secret in a case stemming from Kenneth Starr's 
investigation of President Clinton after a prosecutor expressed 
concern that disclosure would ``tip off targets'' in the ongoing 
probe. U.S. District Judge Claude Hilton said lawyers for Julie 
Hiatt Steele, who is accused of obstruction and making a false 
statement in Starr's investigation, must not disseminate material 
they receive from Starr's office in preparing for trial. The 
material includes FBI interviews with witnesses.

men attacked him. ``I want to make amends,'' the Rev. Thomas Spisak 
told about 25 city and church leaders at Progressive Baptist 
Church, a predominantly black church. Spisak, 55, first told police

<HEADLINE> Middle School Band Member is 76 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EUGENE, Ore. (AP) -- Through the blare of rowdy kids tuning their  
instruments, the 76-year-old man with regal white hair, a black 
cane and a tarnished French horn slowly makes his way to his seat 
in the brass section. 
</P>
<P>
	Retired pipe fitter John Suta is in his third year with the  
Roosevelt Middle School band. The eighth-graders he plays with no 
longer see him as an oddity, but as an inspiration who plays with a 
passion for music and thick fingers gnarled by a lifetime of hard 
work. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is exactly like a middle school band player, even though he  
is older,'' said 13-year-old Anna Richardson. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without music I would just as soon be dead,'' Suta said,  
summing up a philosophy that through the years has led him to take 
up opera, the piano and the harmonica. 
</P>
<P>
	And it was what drove him to walk into the middle school's  
beginning band class and ask for the chance to learn how to play a 
horn he had always loved. Without hesitating, the teacher told him, 
``Take a seat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, Suta has advanced from ``Mary Had a Little Lamb'' to  
Beethoven, from sixth-grade to eighth-grade band. 
</P>
<P>
	Josh Mack took over leadership of the Roosevelt band program  
this year and inherited Suta. ``I just knew he had to be there,'' 
Mack said. 
</P>
<P>
	Suta's love for music goes back to his childhood in Aurora,  
Ill., when his mother would sing songs in her native Hungarian. 
</P>
<P>
	He grew up studying singing with an accompanist for the Chicago  
Opera and speaking German, Hungarian, Romanian and Italian in his 
immigrant neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
	After World War II, he studied to become an opera singer, but  
soon discovered his love of music wasn't enough to pay the bills, 
so he raised two sons on a pipe fitter's wages. 
</P>
<P>
	But music never left Suta's life. After he retired, he teamed  
with a friend on piano and sang at weddings, picnics and senior 
centers. And on his own he even sang the national anthem at a few 
University of Oregon basketball games. 
</P>
<P>
	Through the years, he always remembered the days when his  
brother and a friend would go house to house at Christmas, playing 
carols on a violin and French horn. 
</P>
<P>
	Those memories came flooding back four years ago when he spotted  
an old French horn in a Salvation Army store. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had that horn in my ear,'' Suta said. ``I saw the tag. It  
said 85 bucks. I said to the lady, `What's your best price. I don't 
have 85 bucks in my budget. Will you go $75?'' She said, `Yes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He tried a few adult classes to learn the instrument but they  
were all too advanced. That's what led him to Roosevelt. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite heart trouble and nerve damage in his legs that make it  
difficult to walk, Suta rarely misses practice and is at every 
concert. 
</P>
<P>
	The young horn players look to him for guidance and, in turn,  
they help him. 
</P>
<P>
	About a year ago, he stumbled in the small cluttered house where  
he lives alone, falling on his French horn and crushing the bell. 
He dropped the instrument off at a local music store, not knowing 
how he would afford to pay for the repairs. 
</P>
<P>
	When Suta returned to the store the next day, the horn was fixed  
-- the Roosevelt Middle School band members had pitched in to pay 
for the work. 
</P>
<P>
	``It almost knocked me over,'' Suta said, crying. ``You hear  
about all the things youngsters do, all this and that. But you 
don't hear the beauty of the children.''

<HEADLINE> FDIC Reconsiders New Banking Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Faced with a torrent of criticism from  
citizens worried about privacy, at least two federal banking 
regulators are reconsidering proposed anti-money laundering rules 
that would track banking clients' habits. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's bankers have joined the chorus of people and groups  
urging federal banking agencies to withdraw the proposals, warning 
they could make Americans lose confidence in the banking system and 
government. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to have to do something different. ... We can't  
leave it as is,'' Christie Sciacca, associate director of 
supervision at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Sciacca said the FDIC is considering a range of options, from  
loosening the proposed rules to dropping them altogether. 
</P>
<P>
	Acting Comptroller of the Currency John D. Hawke Jr., who  
oversees nationally chartered banks, ``thinks there are serious 
questions about whether this (proposal) is the right approach,'' 
said his spokesman, Robert Garsson. ``He believes very strongly in 
the relationship between a bank and its customers, and 
confidentiality is a key element in that relationship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed regulations, dubbed ``Know Your Customer'' rules,  
would require banks to verify their customers' identities, know 
where their money comes from, and determine their normal pattern of 
transactions. The current requirements for banks to report any 
``suspicious'' transactions to law enforcement authorities would be 
expanded. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal is designed to combat money laundering techniques  
used by drug traffickers and other criminals to hide illegal 
profits. Laundering includes the use of wire transfers and bank 
drafts as well as ``smurfing,'' the practice of breaking down 
transactions into smaller amounts that do not have to be reported 
under banking laws. 
</P>
<P>
	Privacy advocates and ordinary people have complained that the  
rules would transform every bank teller into a cop. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDIC, as a visible symbol of the federal government with a  
plaque in every bank branch, has borne the brunt of the protest in 
the form of thousands of e-mail messages and letters -- more than 
14,000 of them as of Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The flood of angry e-mail started in December as the 90-day  
public comment period opened for the proposal. It closes on March 
8. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Bankers Association, in a letter sent Thursday to  
the FDIC and other federal banking regulators, cited ``the 
widespread and growing negative perception'' of the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are very concerned about the prospect of having the public  
lose confidence in the banking industry, and in government 
institutions generally, if this proposal is not withdrawn,'' the 
bankers' group wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal ``increases regulatory burdens on banking  
institutions and raises serious privacy concerns on the part of 
bank customers,'' the bankers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, who calls the proposal ``Big Brother  
banking,'' has said he plans to propose legislation next week that 
would bar the federal regulators -- the FDIC, the Federal Reserve, 
the Comptroller of the Currency and the Office of Thrift 
Supervision -- from going through with it. 
</P>
<P>
	OTS spokesman William Fulwider declined comment on the matter  
Friday, and a spokesmen for the Federal Reserve didn't immediately 
return telephone calls seeking comment.

<HEADLINE> Teen Guilty of Boot-Camp Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NAPLES, Fla. (AP) -- A teen-ager was convicted Friday of  
second-degree murder in the pickax and machete killing of a 
juvenile boot-camp counselor during an escape last summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Mazer Jean, 17, showed no emotion after a jury found him guilty  
of killing Michael Sierra, 40, an unarmed guard at the Big Cypress 
Wilderness Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said Jean and another teen-ager had been ordered to  
chop wood as a punishment for swearing when they killed Sierra, 
rolled his body into a lake and escaped in his car last Aug. 25. 
They were captured later that day. 
</P>
<P>
	The other inmate, Jermaine Jones, 16, is scheduled for trial  
Feb. 22. 
</P>
<P>
	Jean faces life in prison without parole.  
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Lee Hollander said he plans to appeal.  
</P>
<P>
	Jean was sent there for possession of a sawed-off rifle, Jones  
for drug offenses and resisting arrest.

<HEADLINE> Moceanu To Train for 2000 Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Three months after a judge granted gymnast  
Dominique Moceanu independence from her parents, she has left the 
turmoil in Texas for a new home in Florida, allowing her to focus 
on the 2000 Sydney Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's happy there,'' attorney Ellen Yarrell said Friday. ``Her  
No. 1 priority is training for the Olympics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moceanu moved Sunday to reunite with her former coach, Luminita  
Miscenco, whom the 17-year-old gymnast credits with reviving her 
career last year. Moceanu sought legal adulthood after her father 
fired Miscenco in October. 
</P>
<P>
	The former coach left Houston after police told Moceanu on Nov.  
13 they were investigating allegations that her father negotiated 
with a hit man to kill Miscenco and another friend of his daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	Dumitru Moceanu has denied involvement in such a plot, but he  
took the Fifth Amendment to avoid self-incrimination when asked 
about it in court in December. Police say the investigation is 
continuing. 
</P>
<P>
	Miscenco, 26, and the other friend, Brian Huggins, 32, helped  
Moceanu run away in October from her parents home in suburban 
Spring, Texas. Dumitru has said Miscenco and Huggins 
``brainwashed'' his daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris County Family Law Judge John Montgomery granted Moceanu  
independence Oct. 28 and issued a protective order Dec. 9 to keep 
her father away from her for one year. Yarrell said she will ask a 
Florida court to issue the same order there. 
</P>
<P>
	Dominique will train for free at an Altamonte Springs, Fla., gym  
owned by Rita Brown, who also owns a gym in west Houston where 
Moceanu resumed training this month, Yarrell told the Houston 
Chronicle. 
</P>
<P>
	The attorney also said Dumitru Moceanu plans to close in early  
February the 70,000-square-foot Moceanu gym that was built with 
money from the gymnast's trust fund. The gym has foundered 
financially without the teen's presence. 
</P>
<P>
	Yarrell said she hopes ``common sense will prevail'' and Dumitru  
Moceanu ``will not attempt to disrupt Dominique's training.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dumitru Moceanu declined comment Friday.  
</P>
<P>
	The Moceanus' attorney, Katherine Scardino, confirmed that the  
gym, which she has said cost $2 million, cannot survive without its 
star attraction. 
</P>
<P>
	``The main draw was Dominique, and she knew that,'' Scardino  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dumitru Moceanu owns the company that runs the gym, Moceanu  
Gymnastics Inc., so he is within his rights to shut it down. 
</P>
<P>
	Dominique has said she believes her parents bought their home  
and other personal items with her money. 
</P>
<P>
	Yarrell said under Texas law, the parents had a right to do  
whatever they wanted with their daughter's money before the trust 
fund was set up in 1996. After that, all her money was supposed to 
go to the trust fund, which she does not have access to until she 
turns 35. 
</P>
<P>
	At 14, Moceanu was the youngest member of the gold medal-winning  
U.S. women's gymnastics team in the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta.

<HEADLINE> Starr Wins Evidence Court Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) -- Kenneth Starr won a court fight Friday to  
keep much of the evidence secret for now in an obstruction case 
stemming from his investigation of President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's office argued there is a danger that evidence provided  
to defendant Julie Hiatt Steele could be funneled to targets of the 
continuing probe. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Steele's lawyers contended that Starr is trying to muzzle  
her from speaking out about what they consider a ``politically 
motivated'' prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr has been investigating a possible cover-up involving the  
accusation that Clinton made an unwanted sexual advance against 
former White House volunteer Kathleen Willey. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Steele is accused of filing a false affidavit in Paula  
Jones' sexual harassment suit against Clinton, lying to two grand 
juries and attempting to influence the testimony of other 
witnesses. In the affidavit, Mrs. Steele denied that Mrs. Willey 
told her about the president's alleged sexual advance and asserted 
that Mrs. Willey asked Mrs. Steele to lie to a Newsweek magazine 
reporter about it. 
</P>
<P>
	Records that prosecutors give Mrs. Steele so she can defend  
herself at her March 30 trial should not be used for ``fund-raising 
purposes, ... on the Geraldo show or on the Larry King show or to 
tip off targets of other pending investigations,'' prosecutor Jay 
Apperson argued. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors have an ``ongoing investigation'' and ``they are  
entitled'' to not have material divulged, U.S. District Judge 
Claude Hilton said in ruling in favor of Starr's request that much 
of the information prosecutors provide to Mrs. Steele stay out of 
the public record. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for Mrs. Steele and eight news organizations, including  
The Associated Press, opposed Starr's request. 
</P>
<P>
	If Mrs. Steele's lawyers refer to the sensitive material in  
pretrial court filings, those papers must be filed under seal, said 
the judge. The ruling raises questions about whether the judge will 
close pretrial hearings if Mrs. Steele's legal team wants to refer 
to the material in courtroom arguments. 
</P>
<P>
	Hilton directed the prosecutors to identify what they consider  
information that must be kept confidential as they turn it over to 
Mrs. Steele's lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked outside court what information prosecutors are trying to  
keep confidential, Mrs. Steele's attorney, Nancy Luque, replied: 
``The truth.'' She declined to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Steele's lawyers contended Starr's staff ``must make some  
showing beyond a bald statement that its interests could be 
impacted, to justify gagging Mrs. Steele and her counsel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecutor ``in this politically charged case imposes no  
such restraints on its own office,'' Mrs. Steele's lawyers said in 
reference to alleged leaks to the news media by Starr's office.

<HEADLINE> Lakers Close to Signing Bryant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Kobe Bryant, who last year became the  
youngest NBA player to start an All-Star game, is expected to sign 
a long-term contract extension with the Los Angeles Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Team spokesman John Black confirmed as much Thursday, saying the  
team hoped to get the deal done today. 
</P>
<P>
	It's believed Bryant, about to start his third season with the  
Lakers although he won't turn 21 until August, will agree to terms 
of a six-year contract worth about $70 million -- close to the 
maximum he can earn under the new collective bargaining agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant had said at the team's media day Wednesday he has never  
thought about changing teams, even though he would have had that 
option when his three-year rookie contract expires at the end of 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going anywhere,'' he said. ``It was kind of funny  
(during the offseason and lockout) sitting back, listening to what 
people were saying, where I was going to go. I wasn't going 
anywhere. I definitely want to play here. 
</P>
<P>
	``Picture yourself being a kid, watching Magic (Johnson) and  
(James) Worthy, being a huge Laker fan. It's a dream. I don't want 
to go anywhere, it's never been on my mind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NBA has given teams a seven-week window which opened Jan. 21  
to use the so-called ``Bird rights'' to extend the contracts of 
second-year players for any salary up to the maximum, regardless of 
salary-cap limitations. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen Iverson and Shareef Abdur-Rahim -- two other prominent  
players who began their NBA careers the same time as Bryant -- have 
both signed six-year contracts worth nearly $71 million this week 
with the Philadelphia 76ers and Vancouver Grizzlies, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant's new deal is believed to be very similar to the  
contracts signed by Iverson and Abdur-Rahim. The contract for 
Bryant, as with Iverson, is believed to have an ``out'' clause 
after five seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the lockout, Bryant was scheduled to make $1.3 million  
this season. The extension starts with next season, and runs 
through the 2004-2005 season. Bryant will reportedly earn $14.62 
million in the final year of the contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant was the 13th player taken in the 1996 NBA draft, being  
selected at age 17 by the Charlotte Hornets after attending Lower 
Merion, Pa., High School. He was then traded to the Lakers for 
center Vlade Divac, who is now with the Sacramento Kings. 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant averaged 7.6 points in 71 games for the Lakers as a  
rookie and 15.4 points in 79 games last season, when he was a 
starter in the All-Star game at age 19.

<HEADLINE> Lobster Contest Means Life or Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Larry the Lobster could be in hot  
water if a school fund-raiser falls short on votes to spare his 
life. 
</P>
<P>
	A 50-cent donation to the Special Olympics buys one vote at  
Jefferson City High School to resolve the question: Should Larry 
live or die? An animal rights organization calls the contest an 
outrage that devalues life. 
</P>
<P>
	People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals issued a plea Friday  
on its World Wide Web site for pressure to free the lobster into 
the Atlantic Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
	The high school's student council organized the lobster  
life-or-death vote to help Special Olympics, which sponsors 
athletic events for mentally retarded and developmentally disabled 
children and adults. 
</P>
<P>
	One lobster intended for use in the fund-raiser already has  
died. It was brought to a school assembly Thursday where students 
chanted ``kill, kill, kill.'' It later ``succumbed to something,'' 
the principal said, and animal rights activists were furious. 
</P>
<P>
	``A total outrage,'' said Bruce G. Friedrich of Norfolk,  
Va.-based PETA. 
</P>
<P>
	Two students -- seniors Melissa Petty and Marti Palermo --  
complained about the assembly and fund-raiser to PETA. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's wrong for high school students to vote on whether a  
living thing should die. You wouldn't do that with a furry cat or a 
bunny rabbit or a dog,'' said Miss Petty. 
</P>
<P>
	The school's principal, Richard Pemberton, said PETA was  
stirring up controversy when students were trying to help a good 
cause. He agreed, however, that the assembly chants were 
``offensive and in poor taste.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Friedrich said PETA was researching possible legal  
steps to save Larry. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are looking into whether it's a violation of the civil  
rights of students who find this morally objectionable,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> SAG Rejects Proposed Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Screen Actors Guild has rejected a  
proposed merger with a rival union that represents television 
broadcasters and voice-over artists. 
</P>
<P>
	Only 46 percent of the SAG members who voted in the referendum  
favored merging with the American Federation of Television &AMP; Radio 
Artists -- far below the 60 percent required for approval. 
</P>
<P>
	About 45 percent of SAG's 98,375 members voted.  
</P>
<P>
	AFTRA said Wednesday that 68 percent of its members who  
participated in the referendum favored the merger. The union has 
71,437 members, and about 40 percent returned ballots. 
</P>
<P>
	Labor organizers had hoped the combined union would have ended  
clashes on which group has the right to regulate actors appearing 
on videotapes, high definition television and digital recording 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
	SAG traditionally controls film jobs, and contends jobs created  
by new technology fall into the film category. AFTRA traditionally 
has represented the non-film jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	``The merger would have swept these conflicts aside,'' SAG  
president Richard Masur said. ``I consider this to be a real 
loss.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After SAG announced the results of its member referendum, AFTRA  
president Shelby Scott was conciliatory. 
</P>
<P>
	``While we regret the results on the SAG side, we are committed  
to work on new ways to cooperate with the Guild for the protection 
and benefit of our members,'' Scott said. 
</P>
<P>
	SAG national director Ken Orsatti said many members feared the  
added competition of an increased number of Guild members chasing 
an unchanged number of jobs.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Currency Below Key Level </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Brazil's currency, the real, sank  
below the psychologically important level of two to the U.S. dollar 
on Friday as President Fernando Henrique Cardoso complained about 
speculation. 
</P>
<P>
	Before recovering a bit at the close, the real was as low as  
2.14 to the dollar, a drop of almost 9 percent from Thursday's 
close of 1.95. The real closed at 2.06 to the dollar, or 48.5 
cents. That was a decline of more than 5 percent from Thursday and 
a plunge of 41 percent from its close of 1.21 to the dollar on Jan. 
12, a day before the currency was devalued. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first time the real had slipped below two to the  
dollar since it was established in July 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is only speculation,'' said Cardoso. ``The dollar can go as  
high as it wants. It will fall back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brazilian stocks, which are less expensive for foreigners as the  
real declines, rose on Friday. The main index rose 2.3 percent at 
the exchange in Sao Paulo, Latin America's biggest stock market. 
</P>
<P>
	The real's slide continued amid a flurry of rumors ranging from  
an imminent announcement of harsh measures to stem capital flight 
to a possible default on the country's debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost $500 million had left the country just on Friday, shortly  
before exchange operations closed, bank analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cardoso said monetary reserves had not been touched by the  
speculation because ``all this results from private transactions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was no official information on the level of Brazil's  
monetary reserves. Central Bank officials said a few days ago they 
stood at $36 billion, including $9 billion from a rescue package by 
the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	The newly appointed head of the Central Bank, Francisco Lopes,  
said Friday the government would announce the level of its reserves 
daily beginning Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Cardoso said he was offering Brazilians ``sweat and tears,''  
borrowing a phrase from Winston Churchill. ``Tears, for not having 
done what we would have already done, and sweat Because we will do 
everything for Brazil to continue being a prosperous nation.''

<HEADLINE> Senate Delivers Witness Subpoenas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House prosecutors, senators and White House  
lawyers are spending the weekend preparing to question Monica 
Lewinsky and two of President Clinton's confidants in closed-door 
proceedings that could be made public next week. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm working my rear off,'' said freshman Sen. John Edwards of  
North Carolina. A practicing lawyer until his election in November, 
Edwards is one of three Democrats who will preside with three 
Republicans over the depositions that begin Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	His weekend reading: ``Everything from the grand jury  
transcripts to the House Judiciary Committee reports.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, too, is planning his schedule around the final phase of  
the trial. He is considering delaying a trip to Central America 
Feb. 10-14 so he would be in Washington when the trial is supposed 
to end Feb. 12, said White House spokesman Joe Lockhart. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the Senate apparently lacks the 67 votes needed to  
remove Clinton from office, House prosecutors this week won the 
right to question Ms. Lewinsky on Monday, presidential friend 
Vernon Jordan on Tuesday and White House aide Sidney Blumenthal on 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	They will be questioned, respectively, by Reps. Ed Bryant,  
R-Tenn.; Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark.; and James Rogan, R-Calif., 
impeachment ``managers'' from the House Judiciary Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for Clinton also will take part in the questioning.  
</P>
<P>
	As Sergeant at Arms James Ziglar sent the subpoenas to the  
witnesses Friday, Senate leaders chose six members to preside over 
the videotaped depositions. Edwards will be joined by Democratic 
Sens. Patrick Leahy of Vermont and Christopher Dodd of Connecticut; 
Republican Sens. Mike DeWine of Ohio, Fred Thompson of Tennessee 
and Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania also will take part. 
</P>
<P>
	At the White House, Lockhart complained that Senate Republicans  
were ``making up the rules literally on the back of an envelope.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``That raises some issues about whether that's fair to all  
sides,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, with the trial on hold until Thursday, senators not  
involved in the depositions headed back to their home states, where 
they could expect a firsthand taste of sentiment about a trial that 
polls say most Americans want to see ended. 
</P>
<P>
	A source close to the prosecutors said they will focus on  
questions not asked the witnesses during a year of investigations 
by Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr and the House Judiciary 
Committee. For example, they believe investigators did not 
adequately look into some private conversations between Ms. 
Lewinsky and Jordan regarding Jordan's job search for the former 
White House intern, said this official, who demanded anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	House prosecutors are expected to zero in on details of the  
relationship in an effort to show the president's efforts to find 
Ms. Lewinsky a job -- through Jordan -- were inextricably connected 
to her filing a false affidavit denying their affair and that the 
hiding of gifts he'd given her was part of a scheme by Clinton to 
obstruct justice. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats said they will be listening closely to the  
prosecutors' questions for signs they have strayed into territory 
not covered by the evidence presented to the Senate by Starr or the 
House. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to make sure people's rights are protected,'' Leahy  
said in a telephone interview Friday. ``I'll be watching for 
questions that go way outside the scope of the record.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The White House legal team is likely to accentuate Ms.  
Lewinsky's most favorable past testimony. Chief among those 
statements was her assertion to the grand jury last August, ``No 
one ever asked me to lie and I was never promised a job for my 
silence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One adviser, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the goal  
would be to show that any cover stories Ms. Lewinsky and the 
president developed were aimed at hiding their relationship from 
the beginning and were not constructed later to obstruct justice. 
</P>
<P>
	The president's legal advisers, both inside and outside the  
White House, said they want to use their side's four hours of 
questioning of Ms. Lewinsky to reassure the 44 Senate Democrats who 
have already voted to dismiss the case and who can deny prosecutors 
the two-thirds majority needed to convict Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Rules Committee officials said the Senate is paying the  
government rate of $250 for Ms. Lewinsky's round-trip airfare from 
California and $126 a night for lodging -- which is less than the 
$168 per night maximum. 
</P>
<P>
	The sessions will be videotaped by a private company under  
contract to the Senate. Senators will have a chance to review the 
tapes before the trial reconvenes Thursday.

<HEADLINE> US, Orioles Discuss Cuba Ball Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Baltimore Orioles owner Peter Angelos met with  
top U.S. officials Friday night to discuss ways of breaking an 
impasse with Cuba over distribution of profits from proposed 
exhibition games between the Orioles and a Cuban national team. 
</P>
<P>
	Angelos declined comment after the 45-minute White House meeting  
with National Security Adviser Sandy Berger and State Department 
Counselor Wendy Sherman. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have nothing to say,'' Angelos said.  
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman David Leavy also declined comment except  
to say the meeting was another step forward in the Clinton 
administration's efforts to expand people-to-people contacts 
between the United States and Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	The State Department on Jan. 4 first broached the idea of an  
exhibition game involving the Orioles and a Cuban team. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration wants any proceeds from the games to be used  
to help the Cuban people. Cuban officials say any profits should be 
earmarked to support Cuban doctors doing hurricane relief work in 
Central America. 
</P>
<P>
	Angelos reportedly wants to know how much flexibility the  
administration would be willing to give the Orioles in future 
discussions with the Cubans. One official, speaking privately, said 
it was highly unlikely the administration would go along with the 
Cuban proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	Angelos returned from Havana last week without an agreement. The  
original plan called for the Orioles to play in Havana in late 
March. The Cuban team would then travel to Baltimore for a return 
match shortly thereafter.

<HEADLINE> After 32 Years, Selig Moving Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Bud Selig's cramped office in the bowels of County Stadium was a  
dust bowl. Packing up for his departure was like an archaeological 
dig. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just found an invitation to a Christmas party in 1972,''  
Selig said Thursday night as the boxes kept piling up. 
</P>
<P>
	After 32 years, Selig finally moved out Friday. Six months  
following his election as baseball commissioner, he packed up 50 
boxes of dust-coated mementos, sending them to the new five-person 
commissioner's office on the 20th floor of a downtown building 
occupied by the law firm he uses. 
</P>
<P>
	For years, his 15-by-18-foot office has looked like a closet for  
things with no place, a tiny TV opposite the desk and a two-line 
telephone his only contact with the outside world. Getting ready 
for the move clearly was a dirty -- and dusty -- business. 
</P>
<P>
	Even Selig admits the place was a mess.  
</P>
<P>
	``Many a person walked in and rolled their eyes,'' he said. ``If  
they don't say it to me directly, I heard later they said: `Did you 
see that office?' '' 
</P>
<P>
	While Selig will have an office in New York, where the rest of  
baseball's central staff works, he will spent most of the time in 
Milwaukee. It's not an unprecedented arrangement -- when Peter 
Ueberroth was commissioner, he worked mostly at baseball's scouting 
office in El Toro, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	At County Stadium, Selig moved into his office three years  
before he even had at team. The ballpark had been empty since the 
Braves moved to Atlanta for the 1966 season and Selig used it as 
his base to court a franchise. His group bought the Seattle Pilots 
in bankruptcy court in early 1970 and immediately turned it into 
the Milwaukee Brewers. 
</P>
<P>
	Tickets from the Brewers first home opener, against the Angels  
on April 7, 1970, were framed and hanged in the office, along with 
a telegram from Vince Lombardi -- Lori Keck, Selig's administrative 
assistant since 1972, used to be the secretary for the famed Green 
Bay Packers coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Selig's favorite story, which he has repeated to many people in  
recent weeks, was in 1974, when the Brewers brought Hank Aaron back 
to Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
	``We went to Atlanta and just about worked out a deal with his  
attorney, Irving Kaler,'' Selig said. ``In trying to sign him, I 
was trying to convince him the Brewers couldn't afford a lot of 
money, that we were a low-budget operation. 
</P>
<P>
	``A week later, he came up to Milwaukee with Hank and came into  
my office. He looked around and said: `He wasn't kidding. This is a 
low-budget operation.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Selig talks about how ``if these walls could talk,'' of how  
cleaning his desk ``was a fascinating walk through all the years.'' 
He still intends to come by the ballpark every day, to inspect 
Miller Park, which is under construction next door and is scheduled 
to open next year. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, he'll be in Seattle. On Tuesday, he'll drive in his  
Lexus to the new office, where he'll be joined by Keck, Sandy 
Ronback (currently the executive secretary to Brewers general 
manager Sal Bando), administrative assistant Lisa Steinman and Tom 
Christopher, who is being hired as his security person. 
</P>
<P>
	``No doubt that I'll make the wrong turn for a while,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Some Starr Files To Be Kept Secret </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) -- A federal judge today ordered some  
material kept secret in a case stemming from Kenneth Starr's 
investigation of President Clinton after a prosecutor expressed 
concern that disclosure would ``tip off targets'' in the ongoing 
probe. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Claude Hilton said lawyers for Julie Hiatt  
Steele, who is accused of obstruction and making a false statement 
in Starr's investigation, must not disseminate material they 
receive from Starr's office in preparing for trial. The material 
includes FBI interviews with witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Steele was a witness in Starr's investigation of a suspected  
cover-up of an alleged unwanted sexual advance by Clinton on former 
White House volunteer Kathleen Willey. 
</P>
<P>
	Steele lawyers Nancy Luque and Dan Marino said Starr's request  
for a court order to restrict use of the material was highly 
unusual. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight news organizations including The Associated Press asked  
Hilton to deny Starr's request for a protective order that will 
keep the material off the public record. 
</P>
<P>
	Records turned over to Ms. Steele's lawyers before the trial  
should not be used for ``fund-raising purposes, ... on the Geraldo 
show or on the Larry King show or to tip off targets of other 
pending investigations,'' prosecutor Jay Apperson argued. 
</P>
<P>
	Hilton said Starr's prosecutors have an ``ongoing  
investigation'' and ``they are entitled'' to not have material 
divulged. He directed the prosecutors to identify what they 
consider to be sensitive information that must be kept confidential 
as it is turned over to Ms. Steele's lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	Hilton's order means that portions of court motions by Ms.  
Steele's lawyers which ordinarily would be filed on the public 
record before trial now will be filed in secret with the judge. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked outside court what prosecutors are trying to keep  
confidential, Luque replied ``the truth.'' She declined to 
elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	The indictment accuses Ms. Steele of filing a false affidavit in  
Paula Jones' sexual harassment suit against Clinton, lying to two 
grand juries and attempting to influence the testimony of other 
witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Steele in the affidavit denied that Mrs. Willey told her  
about the president's alleged sexual advance and asserted that Mrs. 
Willey asked Ms. Steele to lie to a Newsweek magazine reporter 
about it.

<HEADLINE> Hingis Meets Mauresmo in Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) -- One more victory and Amelie Mauresmo  
joins Chris O'Neil as an unseeded Grand Slam tournament champion. 
</P>
<P>
	One more victory and Martina Hingis will be Australian Open  
champion for the third consecutive year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be an interesting final,'' said top-ranked Lindsay  
Davenport, who was ousted in the semifinals by Mauresmo 4-6, 7-5, 
7-5. 
</P>
<P>
	The No. 2-ranked Hingis is riding a 20-match winning streak. Her  
opponent, the 19-year-old Mauresmo, was winning the 1996 French 
Open and Wimbledon junior titles when Hingis, 18, was starting to 
make her mark on the regular pro tour. 
</P>
<P>
	Mauresmo shot up the rankings from 109th to 29th last year. She  
now could become only the second unseeded women's singles winner in 
the 120 Grand Slam events of the three-decade-old Open Era. The 
last was Australian Chris O'Neil, at the 1978 Australian Open. 
</P>
<P>
	With her victory over Mauresmo, will rise to at least No. 18 in  
the rankings. 
</P>
<P>
	Hingis considers herself the favorite against Mauresmo, whom she  
is playing for the third time. Hingis won both of their previous 
meetings, but was taken to three sets both times. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a winning record, but not a very easy one,'' Hingis  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Like Davenport, Hingis noted that Mauresmo's sizzling one-handed  
backhand is one of the biggest strokes in women's tennis. 
</P>
<P>
	``On the court she moves very quickly and the way she plays is  
very unusual in women's tennis. She has a lot of topspin,'' Hingis 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's producing very good tennis. She played very consistent  
these two weeks, and beating Lindsay, I mean, it's a great effort. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope to do better.''  
</P>
<P>
	Mauresmo almost didn't make it past the first round, staving off  
two match points in her victory over Corina Morariu of Boca Raton, 
Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	``My coach told me that usually when it happens like this,  
players are winning the tournament, or going very far,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mauresmo said she beat Davenport with a plan that was ``to mix  
it up a little bit, make her run, make her move a lot, try to use 
that slice backhand that I play really well, and push on her 
forehand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And she has a strategy worked out for Martina.  
</P>
<P>
	``I know how to play Martina. I played her twice last year. I  
will have tactics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davenport's No. 1 ranking is safe, even if Hingis wins here.  
</P>
<P>
	Davenport said Hingis may respond better than she did to  
Mauresmo's game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Amelie has to hold her serve easily so she can get chances to  
break in the match. Martina, I think, likes the ball she (Mauresmo) 
hits. Martina takes the ball early. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Mauresmo has to hit the shots very deep, or Martina  
will definitely take advantage of it.''

<HEADLINE> Jimmy Key Retires After 15 Seasons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Jimmy Key, a left-hander who won 116 games in  
15 major league seasons, announced his retirement Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Key, 37, began his career in 1984 with Toronto and played nine  
seasons with the Blue Jays. He spent four years with the New York 
Yankees, winning the World Series clincher against Atlanta in 1996, 
then joined the Orioles the following the season. 
</P>
<P>
	He became a free agent last fall following the World Series.  
</P>
<P>
	Key, who finished with a 166-117 career record and a 3.51 ERA,  
was bothered the past few seasons by a shoulder injury kept him off 
the mound, often for months at a time. 
</P>
<P>
	He spent more than two months on the disabled list with an  
inflamed rotator cuff last season, winding up 6-3 with a 4.20 ERA 
in 11 starts and 14 relief appearances. 
</P>
<P>
	Key was on the disabled list twice with the Yankees in 1996 but  
still won 12 games. In 1995, the rotator-cuff injury ended his 
season in May when he had shoulder surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Key said he decided to retire after considering his career, the  
health of his arm and his personal life. 
</P>
<P>
	``I deeply appreciate the many fans that have cheered and  
encouraged me, both on and off the field,'' he said. ``Without 
them, we as players would not have the opportunities that are made 
available to us as major leaguers.''

<HEADLINE> Daigle to Lightning in 3-Way Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The Alexandre Daigle saga is over.  
</P>
<P>
	The Flyers traded the disgruntled forward to Edmonton for Andrei  
Kovalenko on Friday, and the Oilers immediately sent Daigle to the 
Tampa Bay Lightning for forward Alexander Selivanov. 
</P>
<P>
	Daigle, essentially kicked off the team by Flyers general  
manager Bob Clarke this week, returns to Philadelphia Saturday 
night when the Lightning play the Flyers. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no question he's a project,'' Lightning coach and  
general manager Jacques Demers said. ``He has tremendous ability 
and speed, which are things we need. He has some negatives, but 
there are more positives than negatives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Daigle, the No. 1 pick in the 1993 draft by Ottawa, nixed the  
Flyers' first attempt to trade him for Kovalenko during the 
All-Star break by refusing to sign a $1 million contract extension 
with Edmonton for next season. Daigle's option for 1999-2000 is 
worth $1.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
	So Clarke banned Daigle from playing and practicing with the  
team. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this age, for a young player to want the money and try to  
select the team he plays for and would rather sit and not play,'' 
an exasperated Clarke said after the deal was completed. ``From our 
standpoint ... he was no good to us, but we still had to pay him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Daigle and Demers came to a verbal agreement on an extension,  
but there's nothing in writing. Daigle has vowed repeatedly that he 
would not take a pay cut to facilitate a trade. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think I will budge,'' Daigle said before working out  
by himself at the Flyers' practice facility this week. ``Maybe 
something extraordinary will happen, but I won't budge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clarke was angry that Daigle asked to be traded, then sabotaged  
his attempt to do it. Under NHL labor rules, Daigle was under no 
obligation to sign for less money. 
</P>
<P>
	``He asked to be traded,'' Clarke said. ``He wanted out of here,  
so we're going to try to accommodate him. ... There's no point in 
hanging around with the team. He's not part of the team anymore. He 
made that decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Kovalenko, the Flyers get a talented right wing with some red  
flags in his past. The book on the Russian forward is that he's a 
bit of a troublemaker who loves to party. 
</P>
<P>
	``From the people we talk to, the people he's played for, they  
liked him,'' Clarke said. ``They liked his talent, they liked a lot 
about him. They said you have to be careful with him, he may drink 
some beer. But a lot of good players have drank a lot of beer over 
the years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kovalenko isn't expected to report to the Flyers until Monday  
because he has to get a visa, Clarke said. 
</P>
<P>
	Daigle has three goals and two assists in 31 games this season,  
his second in Philadelphia. He was traded to the Flyers last season 
for Vaclav Prospal, Pat Falloon and a second-round draft pick. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked earlier this season if he planned to trade Daigle,  
Clarke asked, ``Who would want him?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Daigle's best season was 1996-97, when he had 26 goals and 25  
assists for Ottawa. 
</P>
<P>
	Kovalenko had 13 goals and 14 assists in 43 games for the  
Oilers. Selivanov had six goals and 13 assists in 43 games for 
Tampa Bay.

<HEADLINE> Medical Pot Advocate Gets Prison </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WESTMINSTER, Calif. (AP) -- The founder of an Orange County  
medical marijuana co-op was sentenced Friday to six years in prison 
for selling marijuana to undercover police and mailing the drug to 
a cancer patient. 
</P>
<P>
	Asking for lenience, Marvin Chavez, 42, described himself as a  
casualty of the war on drugs, using marijuana to ease the pain of 
an old back injury and supplying it without profit to people for 
therapeutic use. 
</P>
<P>
	Citing two previous firearms violations and a conviction for  
selling cocaine in the late 1980s, prosecutor Carl Armbrust called 
Chavez ``a dope dealer, pure and simple.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chavez faced a maximum sentence of eight years for three felony  
marijuana convictions: two of sale and one of transport. He was 
convicted in November. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney J. David Nick said he would appeal.  
</P>
<P>
	Nick said Chavez gave marijuana to cancer sufferers, AIDS  
patients and others in need, accepting only voluntary donations in 
return. 
</P>
<P>
	The state's Proposition 215, passed in 1996, legalized  
possession, cultivation and use of cannabis for medical purposes, 
but not its sale.

	DAYTON, Ohio (AP) -- A former mail carrier accused of failing to  
deliver about 30,000 letters, packages and other pieces of mail has 
been released on his own recognizance. 
</P>
<P>
	James Wynn, 54, of Dayton, who was charged Jan. 12 with delaying

comment. The Dayton Daily News reported that Wynn was tired and 
believed he could deliver certain mail later.

<P>
	Postal inspectors learned last February that Wynn may not have  
been delivering mail on his route, and later discovered several 
months worth of mail hidden in his home, said Doug Ervin, an

<HEADLINE> Alaska Shivers in Bitter Cold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	An outbreak of bitterly cold air -- even by Alaskan standards --  
has the 49th state shivering. 
</P>
<P>
	Sure, January is supposed to be cold in Alaska. But air  
temperatures have dropped to minus 70 degrees Fahrenheit in the 
state's interior, with windchills plummeting to minus 100 in the 
coldest weather in a decade, the National Weather Service reports. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every activity is a dangerous activity now in northern  
Alaska,'' said Lee Kelley, meteorologist in charge of the weather 
service office in Fairbanks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whether we get a new record, we'll know in the next two  
days,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Alaska's current low record is minus 80, set at Prospect Creek  
on Jan. 23, 1971. Kelley said typical winter lows in the state 
range from minus 30 to minus 40: ``People will function fairly well 
in that type of temperature range.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chandalar Lake, Alaska, reported a low of minus 71 on Thursday,  
and readings of minus 40 to minus 70 are expected to persist 
through the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	A blocking pattern in the atmosphere is causing frigid air from  
Siberia to spill into northern Alaska, Kelley explained, and as it 
spreads further to the Southeast the cold will begin affecting more 
populated areas, such as Fairbanks, where lows are expected to 
reach between minus 50 and minus 65. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, the cold prompted Gov. Tony Knowles to postpone the  
inaugural ball scheduled for Saturday in Fairbanks. A spokesman for 
the governor said the ball was postponed out of safety concerns for 
those who planned to attend, including children who were to 
perform. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, we're used to a lot of cold. However things start  
breaking at minus 40 and below, Kelley explained in a telephone 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
	``The smaller aircraft that service the villages as a lifeline  
will be grounded by the cold,'' he said. ``All these places are 
already isolated, but they become totally cutoff, that includes 
medical flights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He explained that the cold affects engine hoses on the planes,  
fuel flow and other components. Larger planes, such as Boeing 737s 
and MD80s can fly at temperatures down to about minus 65, Kelley 
said, but one landing can create ice fog that closes an airport 
indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fuel oil begins to jell at minus 40 and that is the major  
heating fuel for interior Alaska,'' he went on . ``By minus 45 the 
fuel will be jelled and so operating diesel vehicles, heating 
buildings will become more and more difficult.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the beads on the tires of cars are beginning to  
break as the rubber becomes rigid in minus 70 degree cold and can 
chip and shatter, Kelley said. ``Coming to work today I saw several 
vehicles with flat tires ... to get a flat at these temperatures is 
a life-threatening situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coping with the cold means a whole different set of clothing at  
minus 70 and below compared to a mere minus 40, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know I wear a lot of clothes when I come to work, lots of  
layered clothing,'' he said. For example, a glove covered by a 
heavy outer shell glove covered by a mitten. 
</P>
<P>
	So, is there any good news? Maybe for the rest of the country.  
</P>
<P>
	John Lingaas, warning coordination meteorologist at the  
Fairbanks weather service office, says at this time it looks as if 
the cold air will remain over Alaska rather than spread south.

<HEADLINE> CNN Appeals to Senators Over Debate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- CNN formally appealed to the Senate on Friday to  
open its impeachment deliberations, arguing that closing the doors 
to the public was an affront to the First Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate twice went into secret session this week, once to  
debate a motion by Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., to dismiss the 
impeachment articles against President Clinton and again to discuss 
whether to call witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	CNN made its argument in the form of a brief written by First  
Amendment lawyer Floyd Abrams and delivered Friday to all 100 
senators and through full-page newspaper ads printed in USA Today, 
the Los Angeles Times and The Washington Post. 
</P>
<P>
	``Conducting these debates behind closed doors denies people  
throughout the world the opportunity to judge the fairness of the 
proceedings and excludes firsthand information from being made 
available to the millions of American voters who have a vital stake 
in the trial's outcome,'' CNN argued in its ad. 
</P>
<P>
	CNN considered filing a lawsuit but concluded that since the  
Senate makes its own rules on the impeachment proceedings, no court 
would have jurisdiction, Abrams said. 
</P>
<P>
	The network wanted to add a legal argument to buttress the  
efforts of Sens. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, and Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., 
to open the proceedings, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate voted 57-43 to keep debate over Byrd's motion secret.  
All except three Republicans favored the secret session and all 
except five Democrats, including Byrd, were opposed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate locked its doors and posted guards when it went into  
secret session, and members were threatened with expulsion if they 
disclose what went on. Deliberations in the impeachment trial of 
President Andrew Johnson in 1868 were also kept confidential, and 
closed sessions have routinely been held in impeachment proceedings 
against federal judges. 
</P>
<P>
	Abrams argued that the Johnson case should not be used as  
precedent, since First Amendment law on freedom of the press has 
largely been established in the 20th Century. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope the senators will pay close heed to their obligations  
to the Constitution,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Brian Lamb, CEO of C-SPAN, sought to rally the news media to  
this cause in late December and said he was disappointed that more 
voices didn't join him. He said many senators are disingenuous in 
fighting to keep proceedings closed yet frequently making 
themselves available for television interviews. 
</P>
<P>
	Lamb called CNN's effort a good step, but said senators listen  
more to their constituents than media organizations.

<HEADLINE> Some Starr Files To Be Kept Secret </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) -- A federal judge today ordered some  
material kept secret in a case stemming from Kenneth Starr's 
investigation of President Clinton after a prosecutor expressed 
concern that disclosure would ``tip off targets'' in the ongoing 
probe. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Claude Hilton said lawyers for Julie Hiatt  
Steele, who is accused of obstruction and making a false statement 
in Starr's investigation, must not disseminate material they 
receive from Starr's office in preparing for trial. The material 
includes FBI interviews with witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Steele was a witness in Starr's investigation of a suspected  
cover-up of an alleged unwanted sexual advance by Clinton on former 
White House volunteer Kathleen Willey. 
</P>
<P>
	Steele lawyers Nancy Luque and Dan Marino said Starr's request  
for a court order to restrict use of the material was highly 
unusual. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight news organizations including The Associated Press asked  
Hilton to deny Starr's request for a protective order that will 
keep the material off the public record. 
</P>
<P>
	Records turned over to Ms. Steele's lawyers before the trial  
should not be used for ``fund-raising purposes, ... on the Geraldo 
show or on the Larry King show or to tip off targets of other 
pending investigations,'' prosecutor Jay Apperson argued. 
</P>
<P>
	Hilton said Starr's prosecutors have an ``ongoing  
investigation'' and ``they are entitled'' to not have material 
divulged. He directed the prosecutors to identify what they 
consider to be sensitive information that must be kept confidential 
as it is turned over to Ms. Steele's lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	Hilton's order means that portions of court motions by Ms.  
Steele's lawyers which ordinarily would be filed on the public 
record before trial now will be filed in secret with the judge. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked outside court what prosecutors are trying to keep  
confidential, Luque replied ``the truth.'' She declined to 
elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	The indictment accuses Ms. Steele of filing a false affidavit in  
Paula Jones' sexual harassment suit against Clinton, lying to two 
grand juries and attempting to influence the testimony of other 
witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Steele in the affidavit denied that Mrs. Willey told her  
about the president's alleged sexual advance and asserted that Mrs. 
Willey asked Ms. Steele to lie to a Newsweek magazine reporter 
about it.

<HEADLINE>  After 32 Years, Selig Moving Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Bud Selig's cramped office in the bowels of County Stadium was a  
dust bowl. Packing up for his departure was like an archaeological 
dig. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just found an invitation to a Christmas party in 1972,''  
Selig said Thursday night as the boxes kept piling up. 
</P>
<P>
	After 32 years, Selig finally moved out Friday. Six months  
following his election as baseball commissioner, he packed up 50 
boxes of dust-coated mementos, sending them to the new five-person 
commissioner's office on the 20th floor of a downtown building 
occupied by the law firm he uses. 
</P>
<P>
	For years, his 15-by-18-foot office has looked like a closet for  
things with no place, a tiny TV opposite the desk and a two-line 
telephone his only contact with the outside world. Getting ready 
for the move clearly was a dirty -- and dusty -- business. 
</P>
<P>
	Even Selig admits the place was a mess.  
</P>
<P>
	``Many a person walked in and rolled their eyes,'' he said. ``If  
they don't say it to me directly, I heard later they said: `Did you 
see that office?' '' 
</P>
<P>
	While Selig will have an office in New York, where the rest of  
baseball's central staff works, he will spent most of the time in 
Milwaukee. It's not an unprecedented arrangement -- when Peter 
Ueberroth was commissioner, he worked mostly at baseball's scouting 
office in El Toro, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	At County Stadium, Selig moved into his office three years  
before he even had at team. The ballpark had been empty since the 
Braves moved to Atlanta for the 1966 season and Selig used it as 
his base to court a franchise. His group bought the Seattle Pilots 
in bankruptcy court in early 1970 and immediately turned it into 
the Milwaukee Brewers. 
</P>
<P>
	Tickets from the Brewers first home opener, against the Angels  
on April 7, 1970, were framed and hanged in the office, along with 
a telegram from Vince Lombardi -- Lori Keck, Selig's administrative 
assistant since 1972, used to be the secretary for the famed Green 
Bay Packers coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Selig's favorite story, which he has repeated to many people in  
recent weeks, was in 1974, when the Brewers brought Hank Aaron back 
to Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
	``We went to Atlanta and just about worked out a deal with his  
attorney, Irving Kaler,'' Selig said. ``In trying to sign him, I 
was trying to convince him the Brewers couldn't afford a lot of 
money, that we were a low-budget operation. 
</P>
<P>
	``A week later, he came up to Milwaukee with Hank and came into  
my office. He looked around and said: `He wasn't kidding. This is a 
low-budget operation.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Selig talks about how ``if these walls could talk,'' of how  
cleaning his desk ``was a fascinating walk through all the years.'' 
He still intends to come by the ballpark every day, to inspect 
Miller Park, which is under construction next door and is scheduled 
to open next year. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, he'll be in Seattle. On Tuesday, he'll drive in his  
Lexus to the new office, where he'll be joined by Keck, Sandy 
Ronback (currently the executive secretary to Brewers general 
manager Sal Bando), administrative assistant Lisa Steinman and Tom 
Christopher, who is being hired as his security person. 
</P>
<P>
	``No doubt that I'll make the wrong turn for a while,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Senate Delivers Witness Subpoenas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate delivered subpoenas Friday for  
Monica Lewinsky and two of President Clinton's advisers, summoning 
them for private, videotaped testimony beginning Monday in the 
impeachment trial. Public showing of the tapes -- or even live 
testimony -- was still an open question. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial moved to a new phase as Sergeant at Arms James Ziglar  
-- the man who makes the ``Hear ye, hear ye'' proclamation at the 
start of each trial session -- carried one subpoena out of the 
Capitol in a manila envelope and sent two others by fax. 
</P>
<P>
	Accompanied by Senate lawyers, he delivered the official papers  
to attorneys representing White House aide Sidney Blumenthal. 
Subpoenas for Ms. Lewinsky and presidential friend Vernon Jordan 
were sent by fax. 
</P>
<P>
	The deposition testimony commanded by the subpoenas could go a  
long way to determine whether any of the three will be called 
before the Senate, whether additional witnesses may be necessary 
and -- ultimately -- whether the trial can be finished by the Feb. 12 
date cited by both political parties. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky, whose relationship with the president led to the  
perjury and obstruction-of-justice charges, will be questioned 
Monday at the Mayflower Hotel, according to her spokeswoman. The 
former intern was interviewed there last Sunday by three of the 
House prosecutors, including Rep. Ed Bryant of Tennessee, who will 
conduct the new questioning. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan's deposition will be Tuesday and Blumenthal's on  
Wednesday in a Capitol office used by the Senate Intelligence 
Committee. It is guarded and always off-limits to the public and 
the news media. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Rules Committee officials said the Senate is paying the  
government rate of $250 for Ms. Lewinsky's round-trip airfare from 
California and $126 a night for lodging -- which is less than the 
$168 per night maximum. 
</P>
<P>
	The sessions will be videotaped by a private company under  
contract to the Senate. Senators will have a chance to review the 
tapes before the trial reconvenes next Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	If any significant, new information is developed, or if the  
demeanor of the witnesses becomes an issue, the chance of live 
testimony would increase. It would take only a majority vote to 
bring any of the three to the Senate floor. 
</P>
<P>
	The barrier is higher, however, for additional witnesses.  
Democratic leader Tom Daschle would have to agree with Majority 
Leader Trent Lott that new witnesses were necessary, giving the 
minority Democrats veto power in this area. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, meanwhile, was considering delaying a planned trip to  
Central America Feb. 10-14 so that he would be in town when the 
trial is supposed to end Feb. 12. White House spokesman Joe 
Lockhart said Clinton would rather not be out of the country at the 
vote. However, Lockhart expressed some skepticism about the date of 
the vote, saying, ``If we knew what day that was, it would make 
scheduling a lot easier.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also on Friday, the Senate's Republican and Democratic leaders  
each chose three senators to referee the questioning by House 
prosecutors and White House lawyers. At each deposition, one 
Republican and one Democratic senator would jointly be in charge -- 
although the other four senators in the pool could be present. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republicans chose Sen. Mike DeWine of Ohio to preside at Ms.  
Lewinsky's deposition, Fred Thompson of Tennessee for Jordan's 
questioning and Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania for the examination 
of Sidney Blumenthal. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democrats picked Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont for the  
Lewinsky deposition. Sens. John Edwards of North Carolina and 
Christopher Dodd of Connecticut also were chosen but did not 
immediately divide up their responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
	At the White House, Lockhart complained anew about the  
arrangements for the final stages of the trial -- especially the 
uncertainty. He accused the Republican-run Senate of ``making up 
the rules literally on the back of an envelope. ... That raises 
some issues about whether that's fair to all sides.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There is an attempt here by the Republican majority to play  
out this process in a way that can inflict maximum political damage 
on the president,'' he said, suggesting there could be ``an endless 
proceeding of new witnesses, new evidence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many senators headed back to their states, where they could  
expect a firsthand taste of sentiment about a trial that most 
Americans -- if polls can be believed -- want to see ended. 
</P>
<P>
	With the trial on hold until next Thursday, Lott was only  
half-joking when he asked the U.S. Conference of Mayors: ``Do you 
realize how really difficult it is, how extremely exhausting it is 
for United States senators to sit in one place for six hours at a 
time and listen to others speak? I mean, there's no vent, no way to 
let off steam.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lott, who referred to a rule that senators remain silent at the  
trial ``on pain of imprisonment,'' told the mayors he was glad to 
``be anywhere but where I've been for the last three weeks, 
tethered to the floor of the United States Senate. ``We feel like 
we're free at last.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The depositions are to begin at 9 a.m. EST each day and end  
after eight hours unless Lott and Daschle agree to extend the time. 
The examination time will be equally divided between House 
prosecutors and White House lawyers, with each side allowed two 
lawyers to conduct the questioning. 
</P>
<P>
	The scope is to be limited ``to the subject matters reflected in  
the Senate record.'' The senator-overseers will make initial 
rulings on objections, but any deeper disputes could be brought 
before the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, CNN formally appealed to the Senate on Friday to open  
its impeachment deliberations, arguing that closing the doors to 
the public was an affront to the First Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate twice went into closed session this week, once to  
debate a motion by Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., to dismiss the 
impeachment articles against President Clinton and again to 
deliberate on whether to call witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic Sens. Tom Harkin of Iowa and Paul Wellstone of  
Minnesota have sponsored motions to open all proceedings, but have 
been unsuccessful. They plan to keep forcing votes on the issue.

<HEADLINE> First Lady, Lott Nearly Cross Paths </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- It wasn't quite the ``Trent and Hillary  
Show,'' but Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott and first lady 
Hillary Rodham Clinton both spoke to the U.S. Conference of Mayors 
Friday, giving a partisan flavor to what's usually a nonpartisan 
gathering. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't really get into partisanship here because our  
residents just want us to make sure our cities run effectively,'' 
said Mayor Neil Giuliano of Tempe, Ariz., a Republican. ``But today 
is a little different. There is a buzz in the air.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In their addresses to the more than 250 mayors gathered, both  
Lott, R-Miss., and Mrs. Clinton stuck to close-to-home issues like 
improving schools, reducing street crime and economic development. 
</P>
<P>
	``Education is going to have a lot of attention and it's not  
going to be just words. We are going to put money behind it,'' Lott 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton said mayors shared credit with the Clinton  
administration for reducing crime and unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
	``The partnership forged between the administration and cities  
must last far into the next century,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Impeachment was never mentioned.  
</P>
<P>
	But for the mayors, who had returned from a meeting with  
President Clinton at the White House just before Lott's speech, 
talk of the president's impeachment simply couldn't be avoided 
around the banquet tables and in the corridors of the Capital 
Hilton Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	``We better get back to the business for this country,'' said  
Mayor Vincent Cianci of Providence, R.I. With a touch of 
exasperation, he added, ``We have the strongest government body in 
the world trying to define what a sex act is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cianci lightly grabbed the elbow of his guest, Mayor Mario  
Primicerio of Florence, Italy, and said, ``Welcome to American 
politics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though Democrats outnumber Republicans in the organization by  
about three to one, member mayors usually adhere to the group's 
nonpartisan stance. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott's speech was met with only polite applause, even when he  
said Washington lawmakers didn't have all the answers to local 
problems, a welcome message to mayors. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton received two standing ovations before she uttered a  
word. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe we can be a bit of a unifying force,'' said a wistful  
Mayor James Perron of Elkhart, Ind. ``Maybe national leaders will 
shed their partisanship if they see we can work together.''

<HEADLINE> Ford Takes Volvo; Swedes Brood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GOTEBORG, Sweden (AP) -- Safe, clean and a trifle stodgy, Volvo  
cars are the essence of Swedishness, and the decision to sell the 
company to American giant Ford kept Volvo President Leif Johansson 
awake at nights. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a difficult, emotional decision between 2 and 4 in the  
morning,'' Johansson said Thursday, hours after the proposed sale 
of Volvo's car division was announced. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford is buying only the car division, and Volvo AB is holding on  
to its profitable truck, bus, construction equipment, marine and 
aeronautical divisions. 
</P>
<P>
	But however successful, those businesses don't have the quiet  
cachet of Volvo cars. 
</P>
<P>
	Compared with the shoddy, inefficient cars that rolled off  
American assembly lines in the 1970s, Volvos seemed almost handmade 
-- and they appealed to the same consumers who drank micro-brewery 
beers. 
</P>
<P>
	They came in relatively small quantities -- just 400,000 last  
year -- and they were ecologically low-impact. With their array of 
innovative safety features, they were seen as a responsible luxury, 
and that image is bolstered by their rather stolid styling. 
</P>
<P>
	They've been a perfect fit for baby-boomers who grew up with  
liberal ideas and then became wealthy -- the ultimate car for the 
``soccer mom.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All of which meshes with Sweden's self-image as a country where  
liberal social policy and strong environmentalism don't mean 
denying oneself some comforts. Even Volvo's plants fit the image: 
their yards are orderly and the buildings look as precise and clean 
as architectural drawings. 
</P>
<P>
	Giving the car division over to Americans, the bold and messy  
industrial predators, takes something away from Swedes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would really hurt if Volvo Cars were entirely owned by  
Ford. Volvo is so Swedish,'' Bertil Johnsson, chairman of the 
Swedish labor confederation LO, was quoted as saying by the Swedish 
news agency TT. 
</P>
<P>
	Behind the sentimentality, however, the sale of Volvo's car  
division is characteristically Swedish, too. 
</P>
<P>
	A diligent and unemotional pragmatism led Sweden from being a  
somewhat backward country a century ago to being the industrial 
power it is today -- and Swedish industrialists have not been afraid 
of going global, when necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	Sweden's other automaker, Saab, is half-owned by General Motors  
and it's widely expected that GM will take it over entirely within 
the year. Astra pharmaceuticals is in the process of merging with 
Britain's Zeneca, Pharmacia merged with Upjohn and Swedish 
telecommunications giant LM Ericsson is moving much of its 
management to London. 
</P>
<P>
	Johansson, after describing his pre-dawn anxieties about selling  
the car division, said when the sun came up, he was confident that 
the sale was the best way to keep Volvos ``Swedish.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ford's size and resources will allow Volvo cars to continue  
their reputation of being the enlightened man's vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were looking at big problems in product development ...  
lean-combustion engines, fuel cells,'' he said, adding that Volvo 
didn't have the money to develop these technologies, but Ford does. 
</P>
<P>
	And the rest of Volvo is likely to behave with typical prudence.  
Volvo will get 50 billion kronor ($6.45 billion) in cash for the 
sale, but it's not planning to go on a bender. 
</P>
<P>
	Volvo this month announced its interest in buying rival Swedish  
truck-maker Scania, and the cash is sure to be an asset in that 
bold move. 
</P>
<P>
	Volvo may have sold part of itself to America, but that may help  
another company stay Swedish.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Seeks Drug Prevention Money </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Drug courts, prison testing and methadone  
treatment of heroin addiction could get more funding in the 
president's budget proposal, as the administration's drug policy 
office seeks to press ahead with prevention and treatment efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	But even as the Office of National Drug Control Policy gears up  
to ask Congress for more money to reduce drug demand, some 
Republicans say they hope to shift the focus back to eradicating 
illegal narcotics at their source. 
</P>
<P>
	The drug policy office received $17 billion for the current  
fiscal year, up from $13.2 billion four years ago. Officials said 
the office expects to request more money in next year's budget, 
which President Clinton will send Monday to Congress Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the money in the current fiscal year, as in many past  
years, has been earmarked for drug reduction efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	``For many years, the prevention side was downplayed,'' James  
McDonough, chief strategist at the drug policy office, said in an 
interview. ``That's where we're going to have to grow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the past four years, the administration has expanded its  
budget for drug prevention by 40 percent, and for drug addiction 
treatment by 17 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The office says such measures have shown results: In December it  
reported that teen drug use was stabilizing after years on the 
rise, although it is still much higher than it was in the early 
1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we've made some progress in the past year,'' said Rep.  
Rob Portman, R-Ohio, pointing to initiatives such as the Drug-Free 
Communities Act that he sponsored in 1997. The program, which 
channels federal assistance directly to grassroots anti-drug 
coalitions around the country, received $20 million last year. 
Portman said he hopes for $30 million in this year's budget. 
</P>
<P>
	Portman also praised a $1 billion, five-year advertising  
campaign launched last year that targets young adults, but some 
members of Congress say they'll be looking for evidence the ads are 
a worthwhile investment. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's one area we are going to carefully look at,'' said Rep.  
John Mica, R-Fla., who heads the House Government Reform 
Committee's panel that oversees drug policy. Mica also said in an 
interview that he hopes to restart some drug eradication and 
interdiction programs cut in the mid-1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	At Republican urging, Congress authorized $690 million in  
emergency spending this summer for illegal drug interdiction, money 
that has helped to pay for more Coast Guard and military personnel 
to fight drug smuggling. 
</P>
<P>
	Coca farming has dropped sharply in the two countries that  
traditionally supply most of the drug crop -- Peru and Bolivia. But 
that success has been offset by increases in Colombia, the drug 
office says. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, that will allow the administration to focus on one  
country, rather than three, in curbing supply, McDonough said. The 
administration also says it would like to see more agents 
patrolling the Southwest border. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Silvestre Reyes, D-Texas, would also like to see improved  
technology for halting drug traffickers, particularly at border 
crossings. But Reyes, a former border patrol chief, said simply 
halting the supply is not enough. He also supports such initiatives 
as drug courts, which allow those convicted of nonviolent crimes to 
go into rehabilitation instead of prison. 
</P>
<P>
	The drug office also will try to gain support in Congress for  
treatment programs, including those using methadone.

<HEADLINE> Passion for Soccer Survives in Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- One newspaper called it the hottest and the  
fiercest sports contest this season. The best seats were gone hours 
before kickoff Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	And yet, it was just an ordinary soccer game.  
</P>
<P>
	To the 45,000 fans packing the People's Stadium, the inaugural  
match of Iraq's 1999 soccer Premier League provided a heady -- and 
inexpensive -- escape from the daily drudgery blamed on 8 1/2 years of 
United Nations sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
	It will provide similar solace to millions of Iraqis as the 16  
teams in the Premier League fight it out every Friday in the next 
five months. 
</P>
<P>
	``The soccer stadium is the purgatory for their sorrows. In our  
victory, the fans see their victory over their troubles,'' Ahmed 
Radhi, Iraq's biggest soccer hero, told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	After exchanging traditional kisses, the white-clad Al-Zawra'a  
team faced defending champion Police Club, dressed in green. 
</P>
<P>
	As the players emerged from the tunnel on the sunburned grass,  
fans who had paid the equivalent of 27 to 83 cents showered them 
with cellophane-wrapped candy. A collective chant of ``Oh-aaay! 
Oh-aaay!'' thundered around the stands. 
</P>
<P>
	A standing ovation greeted Radhi, a former national striker who  
scored Iraq's only World Cup goal -- against Belgium in 1986. Now 
34, he plays for Al-Zawra'a. 
</P>
<P>
	Salam Khatab, 42, an Al-Zawra'a loyalist since the age of 11,  
had taken his front row seat two hours before the start. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will go to the ends of the Earth to see Al-Zawra'a play,''  
he said. Khatab had made sure his wife was an Al-Zawra'a supporter 
before he married her. 
</P>
<P>
	Ending the interview abruptly, an agitated Khatab jumped to his  
feet as a Police Club striker shot ahead toward the Al-Zawra'a 
goal. ``Offside! Offside!'' he hollered. The referee appeared to 
agree. 
</P>
<P>
	Al-Zawra'a and Police Club drew 1-1.  
</P>
<P>
	In recent years, soccer has become almost the last leisure  
activity in Iraqi as U.N. sanctions have made other forms of 
entertainment unavailable or too expensive. 
</P>
<P>
	The sanctions, imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, ban  
all trade, including the free sale of oil, the fount of the 
country's wealth. Left with an insular economy, Iraq has no spare 
cash to import anything apart from food and medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	As survival has become the goal for most of Iraq's 22 million  
people, discos and belly dancing have fallen out of style. 
</P>
<P>
	In keeping with the hard times, the government has banned the  
sale of liquor in public, thus forcing many of Baghdad's well-known 
bars and nightclubs to close down. 
</P>
<P>
	Even soccer has not been spared. Training equipment, shoes,  
track suits and balls are hard to import. Stadium lights don't 
work. Playing tournaments abroad is an unnecessary luxury. 
</P>
<P>
	Top players and coaches have migrated to other countries. Even  
Radhi is preparing to join a Qatar club. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is OK for big names like me. But there is a lot of talent  
here, and they are trapped,'' Radhi said. 
</P>
<P>
	Food shortages have reduced the nutritional intake of players.  
</P>
<P>
	``My boys cannot afford to eat meat and chicken, and they are  
not as strong as before,'' said Abbas Jassim, the assistant coach 
of Police Club. 
</P>
<P>
	Recognizing the problem, the Premier League lets each team play  
only one match a week to avoid straining the players. Before 1990, 
a team played twice a week. 
</P>
<P>
	Sponsorship is nearly nonexistent and player salaries are a  
pittance -- $5 a month. 
</P>
<P>
	The love of the game keeps the players and the fans coming.  
</P>
<P>
	``Football has never stopped in Iraq. It will never be stopped,  
God willing,'' Al-Zawra'a coach Amir Jamil said.

<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Michael Olowokandi, the 7-foot center chosen  
first in the NBA draft, signed with the Los Angeles Clippers on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Olowokandi arrived in Los Angeles from Italy earlier in the day.  
He signed a three-year deal for $10,368,840 after completing a team 
physical. He would get an additional $4,662,472 if the Clippers 
exercise a fourth-year option. 
</P>
<P>
	Olowokandi was released from his contract by Kinder Bologna of  
the Italian League on Monday. Originally, he was bound to that team 
until Feb. 15 -- 10 days after the abbreviated NBA season begins. 
</P>
<P>
	The rookie out of Pacific was not at the Forum for Friday  
night's exhibition game between the Clippers and the Lakers.

<HEADLINE> Salt Lake Gives Justice Records </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- City officials have turned over to the  
Justice Department two boxes of records dealing with negotiations 
between Salt Lake and the United States Olympic Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The records were discovered after Justice investigators asked  
for any documents pertaining to payments the city made to the bid 
committee or to the Salt Lake Organizing Committee, according to a 
news release from Mayor Deedee Corradini. 
</P>
<P>
	The records are from the late 1980s, when Salt Lake was seeking  
to become the U.S. nominee for the 1998 Winter Games. USOC chose 
Salt Lake, but the IOC picked Nagano, Japan, for 1998, and Salt 
Lake for the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The mayor's spokesman, Ken Connaughton, did not immediately  
return a phone call. Corradini was in Washington and unavailable 
for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The organizing committee succeeded the bid committee after Salt  
Lake was picked in 1995 to host the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal prosecutors and agents are casting a wider net in their  
investigation into whether fraud, conspiracy, tax or racketeering 
laws were broken during Salt Lake's bid for the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	The International Olympic Committee disclosed last weekend that  
Salt Lake bidders gave $800,000 in cash, educational, medical and 
travel expenses to 14 IOC members and their families. That amount 
didn't include inkind gifts or services. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, three Utah colleges said they had been subpoenaed  
by Justice Department investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	At the University of Utah, investigators were seeking tuition  
and financial assistance information on bid committee officials and 
more than 120 people who are members of the IOC, their spouses or 
children. 
</P>
<P>
	The subpoenas also sought medical records on several people  
associated with the IOC, letters between SLOC and the university as 
well as contracts for athlete housing and the use of a stadium for 
opening and closing Olympic ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those named in the subpoena was Bold Magvan, the son of  
IOC member Shagdarjav Magvan of Mongolia. The Deseret News reported 
Friday that Bold Magvan received $762 from the bid committee to 
attend the University of Utah in spring semester 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC Vice President Dick Pound, the head of the IOC  
investigation, said he was aware of the Magvan payment. 
</P>
<P>
	``Compared to the size of the other issues we were dealing with,  
it really wasn't very high on our Richter scale at that point. It's 
still an amount that may require some explanation,'' Pound told the 
Deseret News. 
</P>
<P>
	In Utah's Legislature on Friday, a bill was introduced to force  
SLOC to open its doors and books to the public. 
</P>
<P>
	House Minority Leader Dave Jones is sponsoring House Bill 285,  
which would require that any entity receiving public money hold 
open meetings of its board of trustees, make records of past 
meetings available, and follow Utah's open meetings and records 
laws in the future. 
</P>
<P>
	Taxpayers in 1989 approved the diversion of $59 million in sales  
tax revenue to build Olympic venues. SLOC has promised to pay it 
back. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones hopes that buys a place at the table for the public.  
However, some important lawmakers, such as House Speaker Marty 
Stephens don't believe it does. ``SLOC is a private entity,'' 
Stephens said. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill likely will be assigned for a committee hearing next  
week. Jones said he has strong bipartisan support.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Proposes World Financial Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The United Nations has proposed a host of  
initiatives to reform international financial oversight, including 
a suggestion to let developing countries control money flows in 
good and bad economic times. 
</P>
<P>
	In a report released today, a U.N. committee said more money  
must be made available to countries before crises hit, and 
suggested the creation of strong regional reserve funds that could 
also be used for development. 
</P>
<P>
	The report by the U.N. Executive Committee on Economic and  
Social Affairs was prepared in response to the Asian financial 
meltdown that began in July 1997 and subsequent calls for a 
revamped system of financial oversight to contain it and prevent 
another one. 
</P>
<P>
	The International Monetary Fund has stepped in repeatedly,  
promising aid in exchange for economic reforms. But the U.N. report 
says the IMF's actions are often counterproductive or do not go far 
enough. 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF acts more as an organizer than a provider of funds and  
attaches conditions for aid that are ``not always appropriate to 
the problems faced by countries in distress,'' the report says. 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF also has displayed very little ability to stop crises  
from spreading to other countries, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
	``World events since mid-1997 have made painfully clear that the  
current international financial system is unable to safeguard the 
world economy from financial crises,'' the report says. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, a reformed IMF is still seen as a main institution  
to help prevent a financial crisis in one country jumping to 
another. The IMF needs more money to help countries in need but 
also must be revamped and subject to public scrutiny, the report 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The report also suggests a new ``world financial authority''  
that would set international standards for financial regulation and 
supervision. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the more controversial suggestions in the report are its  
call that developing countries be allowed to impose controls on 
capital coming into the economy and out of it. 
</P>
<P>
	Taxes could be used to discourage massive investment during  
economic surges, while investment banks and mutual funds could be 
required to maintain minimum amounts of money in the country during 
economic crises, the report suggests. 
</P>
<P>
	It also said the IMF shouldn't impose conditions on needy  
countries to force the governments to adopt a specific type of 
exchange-rate mechanism. 
</P>
<P>
	The report also said debtors and creditors should be brought  
together during bad economic times to reschedule debt.

<HEADLINE> Bush Family Loves the Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- There is, perhaps, some self-interest behind  
Texas Gov. George W. Bush's proposal to shield the Internet from 
sales tax. Seems the whole Bush family is online. 
</P>
<P>
	``I e-mail back and forth to ex-President Bush. ... He's pretty  
literate,'' said the governor and former president's son. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the former first lady, Barbara Bush, better known for her  
gray hair and pearls than electronic wizardry, ``Mom's on there as 
well. Believe it or not, she's high-tech. She may not look 
high-tech, but she's high-tech.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an hour-long C-SPAN interview for broadcast on Saturday, Bush  
talked of finding an academic chat room to help his 17-year-old 
daughters with their English homework. He talked about his favorite 
history books. He talked about preferring written scripts to 
off-the-cuff speeches. 
</P>
<P>
	But he gave no further clues on The Big Question: his plans for  
the 2000 presidential race. ``I'm interested. I'm thinking about 
it,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Sees Rise in HUD Spending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton's new budget seeks a $2.5  
billion spending increase in Department of Housing and Urban 
Development programs, according to a draft proposal prepared by the 
White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton planned to make public the budget request and his  
proposals for fighting crime, homelessness, and other urban woes 
during a White House meeting today with the nation's mayors. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president is going to talk to the mayors about his agenda  
for urban America. From housing to education, from fighting crime 
to fighting homelessness, and from economic empowerment to making 
our urban areas more livable,'' said White House spokesman Barry 
Toiv. 
</P>
<P>
	The budget request would bring HUD's budget to $28 billion in  
fiscal 2000. It would include funding to increase affordable 
housing, housing vouchers for needy residents in distressed areas, 
and $150 million for newly designated economic empowerment zones. 
</P>
<P>
	A highlight of the plans Clinton was set to detail for the  
mayors was the initiative he announced earlier this month to 
encourage Wall Street to invest in underserved inner city and rural 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
	That plan includes a $1 billion tax credit designed to spur $6  
billion in new equity capital for investment in the targeted 
markets and the creation of new private investment partnerships to 
be known as America's Private Investment Companies, patterned after 
the Overseas Private Investment Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	The president also planned to ask for support for continued  
funding for community policing, a ``zero tolerance'' program to 
keep criminals from falling back on drugs and reduce recidivism, 
and for requiring gun manufacturers to install child safety locks 
on handguns.

<HEADLINE> Battleship Memorialized in Hawaii </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PEARL HARBOR, Hawaii (AP) -- Fifty-five years to the day after it  
was launched by Harry S. Truman's daughter, the ``Mighty Mo'' 
re-entered public life on Friday as the newest member of Battleship 
Row. 
</P>
<P>
	With more than 2,000 people crowding its famous decks, the  
full-dress battleship Missouri was dedicated as a memorial to the 
end of World War II. It was on those same decks that Japan's 
foreign minister surrendered to Gen. Douglas MacArthur on Sept. 2, 
1945. 
</P>
<P>
	``She has always stood for freedom and an ambassador of good  
will,'' said retired Navy Capt. Lee Kaiss, the last commander of 
the ``Mighty Mo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Today the Missouri takes her place as a living symbol of  
freedom.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 887-foot, 45,000-ton battleship is berthed 1,000 feet from  
the USS Arizona, sunk during the Pearl Harbor attack that triggered 
U.S. entry into World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	The ships are meant to be bookends signifying the beginning and  
end of America's involvement in the war. 
</P>
<P>
	In clear and breezy weather, former Missouri crewmen took part  
in ceremonies similar to the recommissioning of a ship. 
</P>
<P>
	The ship -- which also served in Operation Desert Storm in 1991 --  
arrived in Pearl Harbor in June after being towed from Bremerton, 
Wash., where it had been mothballed since 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	After its arrival, about 5,000 volunteers renovated the ship so  
visitors can be transported back to the 1940s. A shuttle bus plays 
music, news clips and radio broadcasts from that era, and the ship 
displays memorabilia. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm overwhelmed with joy that they're taking such good care of  
her,'' Kaiss said. ``It's an important part of history and it's 
important to keep her in the public eye.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ship has had a high profile ever since it was christened on  
Jan. 29, 1944, by Margaret Truman. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly a year later, the battleship joined the Third Fleet in  
the Pacific and fought at Iwo Jima, Okinawa and Kyushu, among other 
World War II sites. 
</P>
<P>
	The ship then entered history at 9:04 a.m. on Sept. 2, 1945,  
when Japan Foreign Minister Mamoru Shigemitsu signed the Instrument 
of Surrender aboard her decks in Tokyo Bay. A plaque marks the site 
where Gen. Douglas MacArthur accepted Japan's surrender. 
</P>
<P>
	The battleship first was decommissioned on Feb. 26, 1955, but  
then recommissioned in 1986 for a round-the-world cruise. 
</P>
<P>
	It returned to battle on Jan. 3, 1991, when it entered the  
Persian Gulf to join Operation Desert Storm. The battleship fired 
Tomahawk missiles and hundreds of 16-inch shells at Iraqi positions 
before leaving two months later. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is undescribable pride among the men who served aboard  
this ship,'' said Herb Fahr, of Plain View, N.Y., a former crewman 
and president of the USS Missouri BB-63 Association. ``We know our 
ship will be here for the next millennium.''

<HEADLINE> Bubby a Beautiful Buy for Broncos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- John Elway and Bubby Brister are virtually the same  
size and age. The similarities seem to end there for the future 
Hall of Fame quarterback and the career journeyman. 
</P>
<P>
	Elway has thrown for 50,000 yards and 300 touchdowns and has  
more victories (148) than any starting quarterback in NFL history. 
Brister has thrown for 14,000 yards and 84 touchdowns in 12 mostly 
nondescript seasons for four teams. 
</P>
<P>
	But Brister, who was so unmarketable that he was out of football  
in 1996, did a dead-on imitation of Elway this season. 
</P>
<P>
	An assortment of injuries to the 38-year-old Elway caused him to  
miss all or parts of six games this season, and the 36-year-old 
Brister stepped confidently into the void. He went 4-0 in his four 
starts and also directed a comeback win in relief. 
</P>
<P>
	In doing so, the super sub accomplished what no quarterback  
other than Elway could do in nine years -- win a game for the Denver 
Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
	Since Gary Kubiak replaced an ailing Elway and engineered a win  
over Washington in 1989, the Broncos were 0-7 in games that Elway 
did not start. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was just trying to earn my keep a little bit,'' Brister  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Broncos entrusted their offense to Brister, tight end  
Shannon Sharpe, sounding like a nervous father, issued a warning: 
``We're giving you the keys to the Ferrari. Just don't wreck it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brister slipped seamlessly behind the wheel and drove the  
Broncos' fine-tuned, high-octane machine without mishap. 
</P>
<P>
	``No dents, no dings,'' a beaming Sharpe said.  
</P>
<P>
	Of course, this luxury car comes fully loaded with all the  
options, including 2,000-yard rusher Terrell Davis, a prolific 
receiving corps, one of the NFL's best offensive lines, a 
run-stuffing defense and special teams that are truly special. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since I've been here, it's like I've died and gone to football  
heaven,'' Brister said. ``I'm just glad I got to experience a team 
like this before my day is done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brister knows the other, darker side of football, too.  
</P>
<P>
	Walter Andrew Brister III, given the nickname Bubby by his five  
older sisters, spent his first seven NFL seasons in Pittsburgh, 
four of them as a full-time starter. Then came two seasons in 
Philadelphia and a purgatorial season with the New York Jets in 
1995 that was so depressing he spent the next year out of football. 
</P>
<P>
	He used that idle year to help care for his father, who was  
diagnosed with prostate cancer that is now in remission. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought my career might be over,'' Brister said. ``When  
you're out of the game like I was, you appreciate it more. I felt 
like I could still run and throw and help somebody win. I wanted to 
play again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Broncos linebacker Bill Romanowski, who played with Brister in  
Philadelphia, recommended him to Broncos coach Mike Shanahan prior 
to the 1997 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't want to play anywhere but here, really,'' Brister  
said. ``I talked to a couple of teams. But I knew Romanowski and I 
knew John. I had a feeling they had a chance to win a Super Bowl. I 
was really hoping I'd get to land here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Broncos are glad he did.  
</P>
<P>
	After playing sparingly in 1997, Brister completed 78 of 131  
passes this season for 986 yards, 10 touchdowns and three 
interceptions, earning a passer rating of 99.0 that was higher than 
Elway's 93.0. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know people were wondering about me,'' he said. ``They  
hadn't won a game in nine years without John being the starter. So 
it was a good feeling, especially being out of football for a 
while, to prove I could still get the job done if I have the 
supporting cast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like every backup, he's prepared to replace Elway at any minute,  
but hopes he doesn't have to play in Sunday's Super Bowl ``except 
to kneel down to kill the clock at the end of the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Elway retires after this game, Brister is eager to be the  
heir apparent, despite the fact he will be 37 next season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody is going to fill John Elway's shoes. Ever,'' Brister  
said. ``But I feel like I have the experience and I've played well 
enough this year to maybe be the front-runner if he does decide to 
leave. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like I can get it done for a year or two and let them  
develop our two young guys (Jeff Lewis and Brian Griese). They're 
both going to be great players. My main goal is to fend them off 
for a while.''

<HEADLINE> Wis. Sues Publishers Clearing House </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MADISON, Wis. (AP) -- The state of Wisconsin has sued Publishers  
Clearing House, accusing it of using deceptive advertising to 
persuade consumers to buy magazines and merchandise and of 
illegally targeting the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's mailed advertisements give recipients the  
impression they have won or will win large cash prizes or can 
improve their chances of winning if they buy, Attorney General 
James Doyle said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit seeks all profits the sweepstakes made from the  
unlawful sale of merchandise in the state and requests restitution 
for consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	Doyle showed a videotape of a 79-year-old Wisconsin Dells man,  
identified only as Leonard, who has spent $10,000 on Publishers 
Clearing House merchandise since 1989 without winning. 
</P>
<P>
	Publishers Clearing House, based in Port Washington, N.Y., said  
it ``has thousands of satisfied customers in Wisconsin.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``In general, we believe our promotions are clear and easy to  
understand and the overwhelming majority of consumers who play the 
sweepstakes know how to play and know no purchase is necessary,'' 
vice president Todd Sloane said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, American Family Publishers agreed to pay Wisconsin  
and 24 other states $50,000 each to settle allegations of deceptive 
sweepstakes advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1994, Wisconsin and 13 other states obtained an out-of-court  
settlement with Publishers Clearing House over alleged 
misrepresentations.

<HEADLINE>  Feds: Yanks' Stadium Not Accessible </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- America's pastime is not fun for Yankee fans who  
use wheelchairs. They claim the House that Ruth built is 
unaccommodating. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White agrees, saying Thursday that her  
office has joined a lawsuit against the New York Yankees and added 
the city of New York, which owns the stadium, as a defendant. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal suit -- filed in December on behalf of three New  
Jersey citizens and a Manhattan man, all wheelchair users -- claims 
the area of Yankee Stadium set aside for them has restricted views. 
It also says they must pay nearly 100 percent more for tickets and 
can only get them by calling the stadium during certain hours. 
</P>
<P>
	``Baseball is the national pastime and Yankee Stadium is home to  
its most storied franchise,'' White said. ``This lawsuit seeks to 
ensure that people with disabilities will have an equal opportunity 
to experience the thrill of the game in this historic place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yankees spokesman Rick Cerrone said the organization does not  
comment on pending litigation. A call to the city's law department 
was not immediately returned. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages and calls on the court to  
make the Yankees fix the 75-year-old Bronx stadium so it's more 
accessible to wheelchair users. It reserves 64 wheelchair spaces 
and 24 accompanying seats for each game. 
</P>
<P>
	Plaintiff Joseph Reilly, of Tenafly, N.J., said he stopped going  
to Yankees games in 1977 because he couldn't see anything from the 
section set aside for wheelchair users. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit said one area for wheelchair users behind the main  
box level has no seats for companions and costs twice as much as 
most seats. 
</P>
<P>
	The other area, located on the field box level, limits  
wheelchair users to one companion and costs up to three times as 
much as general stadium seating, the lawsuit said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yankees have always been famous for hitting home runs,'' said  
Reilly, 56, in a telephone interview. ``What's the point in going 
if you can't see one?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Plaintiff Theresa Murphy, of Middletown, N.J., said she tried to  
get two Yankees tickets for one of the playoff games last September 
with the Cleveland Indians as an early birthday present for her 
husband. 
</P>
<P>
	After calling a ticket agent and being told it could not help  
her, Murphy called the Yankee Clubhouse store in Manhattan, which 
told her to call the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I called the stadium, I reached a man who told me he  
couldn't help me because the woman who handles such tickets was out 
to lunch,'' she said. ``So I hung up and wrote a letter to Mr. 
(George) Steinbrenner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I phrased it very nicely, saying all I was asking for is help  
in getting the tickets. I was happy to pay for them. I got no 
response.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Plaintiff James Pascuiti, of Mountainside, N.J., said he became  
concerned about Yankee Stadium's inaccessibility to wheelchair 
users after attending baseball games at other stadiums, like 
Baltimore's Camden Yards and Boston's Fenway Park. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those stadiums were more suitably set up and designed to allow  
for persons in wheelchairs,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Plaintiff Walter Rynasko, of Manhattan, said he's limited to two  
seating choices at the stadium: one disabled seat next to a regular 
seat behind home plate at a premium price, or sitting in an open 
area with a rail with a view of the scoreboard and outfield blocked 
and no seats for able-bodied companions. 
</P>
<P>
	``An able-bodied person can sit in the bleacher area for as  
little as $8 and see the entire field,'' said Rynasko, 36. ``I just 
want equal rights and equal access for people with wheelchairs.''

<HEADLINE> First Lady Pushes Foster Care Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hoping to ease the transition to independence  
for the 20,000 children who move out of foster care each year, 
Hillary Rodham Clinton announced $280 million in proposed programs 
to help them obtain insurance, get jobs, and finish their high 
school diplomas. 
</P>
<P>
	``When a child goes into foster care, in a very real sense, we  
are all that child's family,'' Mrs. Clinton said Friday. ``And we 
haven't been as loving and concerned a family for our children in 
foster care as we should be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton, accompanied by Tipper Gore and Health and Human  
Services Secretary Donna Shalala, made the announcement before a 
group of former foster children and advocates. 
</P>
<P>
	The goal of the proposals, which will be included in the fiscal  
2000 budget the president sends to Congress on Monday, is to make 
sure foster children don't find themselves without a safety net 
just because they turn 18. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is one of those problems that can be solved,'' Mrs.  
Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposals would increase by 50 percent the federal  
Independent Living Program, which helps older foster children earn 
high school diplomas and learn such daily living skills as planning 
a budget and securing housing. Its budget has been frozen at $70 
million since 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	It also would provide health insurance to foster children, who  
often lose coverage when they move out of the system. 
</P>
<P>
	``For too many people, foster care means insurance, and when  
they leave they lose their Medicare coverage, '' Mrs. Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Friday, President Clinton said he would seek a $2.5 billion  
spending increase for the Department of Housing and Urban 
Development. 
</P>
<P>
	``The present prosperity is an opportunity and a responsibility  
to make sure that opportunity and prosperity reaches every person, 
into every corner of this country, into every neighborhood in every 
city of this country,'' Clinton told a gathering of the nation's 
mayors at the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we cannot do this now with what some people believe is the  
strongest overall economy in our history, believe me, we will never 
get around to doing the job,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	His proposal would include money to increase affordable housing,  
housing vouchers for needy residents in distressed areas and $150 
million for newly designated economic empowerment zones. Another 
highlight was the initiative he announced earlier this month to 
encourage Wall Street to invest in underserved inner-city and rural 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
	That plan includes a $1 billion tax credit designed to spur $6  
billion in new equity capital for investment in the targeted 
markets and the creation of private investment partnerships, 
patterned after the Overseas Private Investment Corp.

<HEADLINE> Broncos Workout in Colorful Hats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAVIE, Fla. (AP) -- If it's Friday, it's Hat Day for the Denver  
Broncos. It also was Noise Day. 
</P>
<P>
	In their final practice for Sunday's Super Bowl, the Broncos  
worked out in shorts and caps, instead of helmets, which is their 
tradition on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1-hour, 35-minute practice was conducted with simulated  
crowd noise blaring from large speakers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a normal part of our Friday procedure for away games,''  
coach Mike Shanahan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tight end Dwayne Carswell dropped a pass in the end zone,  
prompting Shanahan to say, ``Come on, we've got to concentrate. 
Just like the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After two more plays were run, Shanahan said, ``Give House  
(Carswell) another chance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This time, he caught a pass from John Elway, resulting in cheers  
from his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today was a review of everything, and we put in our red-zone  
package,'' Shanahan said of his offense inside the opponent's 
20-yard line. ``The tempo was good and the concentration level was 
great. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had a good week. The transition went well last night  
with the families coming in. It's certainly easier the second time 
around.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Broncos will spent a short time at Pro Player Stadium on  
Saturday in what is usually a walk-through. 
</P>
<P>
	``Normally, we will run through the first 15 plays,'' he said,  
``but with so many people around, we won't even do that. We'll just 
walk around and look at the grass.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shanahan announced the four players who will be inactive for the  
Super Bowl: wide receiver Justin Armour, guard Chris Banks, 
defensive end Cyron Brown and offensive tackle Trey Teague. Another 
four players, including the third quarterback, will be announced on 
Sunday.

<HEADLINE>  Cher Will `Rock' National Anthem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Cher insists her attire when she performs the  
national anthem at the Super Bowl will be plain. Her rendition 
won't be, though. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a little rock-and-roll,'' the Oscar-winning entertainer  
said Friday as she prepared to rehearse. ``It rocks, it really 
does. I never realized that before. And the lyrics are great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cher will join the high-energy rock band KISS in a powerful  
pregame show that will include more than 600 other performers, 
along with pyrotechnics and other special effects. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we'll be trying to do on Super Bowl Sunday is to try and  
bring down low-flying aircraft,'' band member Ace Frehley said. 
``That's our goal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cher joins a stellar list of Super Bowl anthem performers that  
includes Diana Ross, Barry Manilow, Billy Joel, Whitney Houston, 
Garth Brooks and Harry Connick Jr. Houston's version, performed in 
1991 at the height of the Gulf War, is considered one of the 
all-time classics. 
</P>
<P>
	Cher, whose jet-black hair was streaked with fuchsia at Friday's  
news conference, wouldn't guarantee her version would rank up with 
Houston's. But she promised her own style with the song, considered 
one of the toughest to master vocally. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to do my version of the national anthem,'' she said.  
``If they wanted a straight version, they could have gotten a 
hundred of people to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like other recent performers, Cher prerecorded the anthem with  
an 80-piece orchestra. She hasn't decided yet whether to sing it 
live on Sunday or lip-sync it. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're leaving it up to me,'' she said. ``But they said  
there's something about airplanes and stadium noise, so they needed 
to get the main track down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She also remains undecided about what to wear, but reiterated  
her previous statement that it won't be her usual style of 
revealing -- and sometimes outrageous -- outfits. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just going to wear something really plain,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	That won't be the case with KISS. Known for its heavy makeup,  
black studded costumes and stage antics, the group has sold more 
than 80 million records, and their recent reunion tour was the 
highest-grossing tour of 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``We love doing what we do, anytime we get on stage,'' Frehley  
said. ``We're not hams, we're the whole pig.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This year's Super Bowl also will feature a postgame show,  
headlined by KC and the Sunshine Band, which is celebrating its 
25th anniversary this year. 
</P>
<P>
	It's also a homecoming for band leader H.W. Casey, who was born  
in Hialeah, Fla., and grew up in Miami Lakes. He is one of three 
original members still with the group. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope it's not a blowout because then it'll be really  
boring,'' Casey said. ``That's the big thing.''

<HEADLINE> China Not Changing Trade Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- Following a three-day meeting of top trade  
officials, a spokesman for China's trade ministry offered no hint 
Friday of a new offer on liberalizing the country's trade regime, 
and few new options for weathering the Asian economic crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	With Premier Zhu Rongji expected to visit the United States in  
April and trade officials in Washington warning of more trouble if 
the trade deficit with China continues to grow, there has been 
speculation of a possible fresh offer by Beijing on trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if a new proposal might be in the offing, trade ministry  
spokesman Hu Chusheng repeated China's position that as a 
developing nation, it should not be pushed to lift tariffs and 
other trade barriers any faster. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope the foreign counterparts will take into account  
China's status as a developing country and not raise any 
unreasonable demands or requests,'' Hu told reporters at a news 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Chinese government's stance is known to all and our  
enthusiasm has not declined. We will continue to carry out our 
pledges,'' Hu said. 
</P>
<P>
	China began 13 years ago to try to gain entrance in the  
predecessor to what is now known as the World Trade Organization, 
the international watchdog on fair trade. The United States and 
other WTO members have urged Beijing to move faster in cutting 
tariffs and opening markets, particularly in finance and services, 
to foreign competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky warned  
that with the trade deficit with China averaging more than $1 
billion a week -- $52.9 billion in the first 11 months of 1998, a 
15.5 percent increase over the same period of 1997 -- trade friction 
was likely to grow. 
</P>
<P>
	If anything, with most of Asia mired in recession and its own  
market-oriented reforms slowing due to fears of social unrest, 
China appears unlikely to take any major initiatives on trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Facing declining demand for its exports in neighboring Asian  
markets, Beijing says it hopes to continue to sell more of its 
products in North America, Europe, Latin America and Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	The trade ministry officials did not offer specific targets for  
trade in 1999, saying only that China hoped to achieve ``a certain 
degree of increase'' and a ``basic balance between imports and 
exports.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to Chinese customs statistics, which tend to differ  
from U.S. figures because they exclude trade through Hong Kong, 
China's surplus in 1998 was $43.59 billion, an increase of 7.9 
percent over 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The officials noted that China had taken some incremental steps:  
increasing the number of firms allowed to engage directly in 
foreign trade, loosening licensing requirements, raising export tax 
rebates and expanding the number of areas where trading joint 
ventures will be allowed. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the measures announced following the three-day meeting  
on trade and economic cooperation appear intended to encourage 
foreign investment in certain sectors, such as high-tech, trade, 
civil aviation and engineering, rather than to open markets to more 
foreign competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Wang Shijia, director of the ministry's Department of Foreign  
Investment Administration, also said China would seek ways to 
facilitate more mergers and acquisitions of Chinese firms by 
foreign companies. She did not provide any details.

<HEADLINE> Lakers Sign Bryant to Extension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- Although he's nearly seven months from  
his 21st birthday, Kobe Bryant is set for life financially, thanks 
to the six-year contract extension he signed with the Los Angeles 
Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, believed to be worth almost $71 million, was completed  
Friday, and Bryant said the Lakers won't have any regrets. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to be worth $70 million, I'm going to be worth it,''  
he said. ``Don't even worry about that. I'm going to be worth it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant has one year remaining on the contract he signed before  
his rookie season in 1996. The extension starts with next season, 
and runs through the 2004-2005 season. Once it takes effect, Bryant 
will be the second-highest paid Laker, behind Shaquille O'Neal. 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant will reportedly earn $14.62 million in the final year of  
the contract, and will be just 26 when it expires. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're very pleased to get this contract done,'' executive vice  
president of basketball operations Jerry West said. ``As I've said 
since we traded for Kobe back in 1996, we think he's one of the 
most talented young players in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's going to continue to improve and make us a better team as  
he does so, and we're glad to know he'll be a Laker for years to 
come.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant was the 13th player picked in the 1996 NBA draft, being  
selected at age 17 by the Charlotte Hornets after attending Lower 
Merion, Pa., High. He was then traded to the Lakers for center 
Vlade Divac, who is now with the Sacramento Kings. 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant averaged 7.6 points in 71 games for the Lakers as a  
rookie, and 15.4 points, 3.1 rebounds and 2.5 assists in 79 games 
last season, when he had the highest scoring average among 
non-starters in the NBA and became the youngest player in league 
history to play in an All-Star game. 
</P>
<P>
	It's believed Bryant will earn the maximum allowable under the  
new collective bargaining agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've loved my two years with the Lakers and am looking forward  
to the future,'' said Bryant, who will likely continue his role as 
a sixth man this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant said he plans on being a Laker for life.  
</P>
<P>
	The NBA has given teams a seven-week window which opened Jan. 21  
to use the so-called ``Bird rights'' to extend the contracts of 
second-year players for any salary up to the maximum, regardless of 
salary-cap limitations. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen Iverson and Shareef Abdur-Rahim, two other prominent  
players who began their NBA careers the same time as Bryant, both 
signed six-year contracts worth nearly $71 million this week with 
the Philadelphia 76ers and Vancouver Grizzlies, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant's new deal is believed to be very similar to the  
contracts signed by Iverson and Abdur-Rahim. The contract for 
Bryant, as with Iverson, is believed to have an ``out'' clause 
after five seasons.

<HEADLINE> Series Latches Onto Silver Charm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HALLANDALE, Fla. (AP) -- The idea of a series matching the top  
horses in thoroughbred racing's handicap division seemed a solid 
proposal when first offered. Then a problem cropped up in the 
months leading up to the launch. 
</P>
<P>
	The division quickly ran low on top horses.  
</P>
<P>
	At least a half-dozen prominent mounts were put out to stud  
before 1999 commenced, robbing the National Thoroughbred Racing 
Association of the depth it sought to increase the sport's 
visibility. 
</P>
<P>
	One marquee name remains, however. As the NTRA Champions series  
opens with Saturday's running of the $500,000 Donn Handicap at 
Gulfstream Park, Silver Charm is the unquestioned centerpiece. 
</P>
<P>
	``Silver Charm probably has the highest name recognition and  
awareness level among general sports fans as any horse in the 
division,'' NTRA commissioner Tim Smith said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Donn is the inaugural event on the NTRA Champions calendar,  
a set of 11 televised races to showcase racing's older champions. 
Industry officials hope the series can keep the sport in the public 
eye beyond the Triple Crown and Breeders' Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Not since the great Cigar tied Citation's record of 16  
consecutive wins in 1996 has horse racing had a drawing card who 
could capture the interest of the casual sports fan whenever he 
ran. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Baffert, Silver Charm's trainer, recalls when Cigar was  
brought to Del Mar for the 1996 Pacific Classic. A crowd of 44,181 
packed the seaside California track for the race, and Cigar's 
presence sparked a buzz all week. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just thought while watching him, you could tell everybody  
was so enthused with him,'' Baffert said. ``I was like a fan. I 
loved watching him run. You're almost in awe of him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cigar's streak ended in that race when he finished second to  
Dare and Go, but he left an impression on Baffert. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said to myself that if I ever have a horse like this, I want  
to make sure I share him with the fans,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Now Baffert, with the encouragement of Silver Charm owners Bob  
and Beverly Lewis, is making good on his word. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the things this industry needs so badly is stars,'' Bob  
Lewis said. ``The only way we can accomplish that is if we can keep 
them on the racetrack.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many others, however, went the stud route. One was Skip Away,  
who won nine consecutive races before finishing third in the Jockey 
Club Gold Cup. Another was Favorite Trick, the 1997 Horse of the 
Year as a 2-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
	Joining them were Breeders' Cup Classic champion Awesome Again,  
Coronado's Quest, Gentlemen, Touch Gold and Swain. 
</P>
<P>
	Rival trainer H. James Bond, who will send out Behrens in the  
Donn, calls Silver Charm ``the solo king right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Silver Charm first gained attention by winning the Kentucky  
Derby and Preakness in 1997. The big gray horse won six of nine 
starts last year, including the $4 million Dubai World Cup, and was 
second to Awesome Again in the Breeders' Cup Classic. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday's top two challengers have solid credentials, if not  
name recognition. 
</P>
<P>
	Sir Bear has won his past two starts in the Cigar Mile at  
Aqueduct and the Broward Handicap at Gulfstream. Puerto Madero, a 
Chilean horse now based in California, took the Native Diver 
Handicap at Hollywood Park last month and has won 10 of 15 lifetime 
starts.

<HEADLINE> Wrong Number Saves Suicidal Woman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Elizabeth Hartley listened a few seconds to a  
wrong-number caller and heard volumes in the slurred speech of a 
forlorn woman who had ``just called to say goodbye.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Hartley and co-worker Emlyn Philbert said they never gave  
any thought to hanging up. They kept the Virginia woman on the 
phone for nearly an hour as she drifted in and out of consciousness 
-- and they saved her life long-distance. 
</P>
<P>
	The unlikely connection came about Wednesday when the  
55-year-old woman, whose identity was not released, misdialed and 
rang the J. Streicher securities firm where Ms. Hartley and Ms. 
Philbert work in sales. 
</P>
<P>
	``She asked to speak to Liz and I got on the phone,'' Ms.  
Hartley, of Rutherford, N.J., recounted Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Right away, she knew the caller was in trouble.  
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody loves me,'' the woman told her, slurring her words. ``I  
just called to say goodbye.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Hartley said she never considered hanging up. ``You hear  
something in somebody's voice and you know something's terribly 
wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She motioned for Ms. Philbert to pick up the phone and for the  
next 45 minutes they talked and pleaded with the woman until she 
gave them her name, address, telephone number. Ms. Hartley called 
police in Hampton, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was just so sad,'' said Ms. Philbert. ``Such a sad, sad  
person.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The woman drifted in and out of consciousness all the while,  
speaking haltingly about her broken life. 
</P>
<P>
	She talked of being all alone, of wanting ``Brian'' to hug her.  
She spoke about a son who was murdered four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Philbert didn't ask too many questions for fear ``it would  
push her over the edge.'' Instead, she posed as the friend, Liz, 
and kept telling the woman that she loved her. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just kept talking and talking,'' Ms. Philbert said.  
``Elizabeth says I can talk paint off the wall. I don't know if 
that's bad or good, but in this case it was good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police arrived to find the woman semiconscious in a bedroom,  
still on the line with Ms. Philbert. 
</P>
<P>
	The woman, who had overdosed on a combination of alcohol and  
prescription pills, was taken to a psychiatric facility, said Sgt. 
Jeff Walden, a Hampton police spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Hartley and Ms. Philbert believe they were guided by a  
guardian angel. A friend of Ms. Philbert who died this week meant 
for them to help the despondent woman, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	``What are the odds that this lady dials a wrong number and  
finds us in the city of New York,'' asked Ms. Philbert, 44. ``You 
gotta believe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Hartley, 48, agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're all supposed to have a guardian angel, right?'' she  
said. ``I think Emlyn's friend just earned her wings.''

<HEADLINE> The Happy Hopper Wins at Oaklawn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOT SPRINGS, Ark. (AP) -- Jockey Robby Albarado passed up a  
chance to ride a couple of solid favorites in New Orleans on Friday 
to come north for the mount aboard The Happy Hopper. 
</P>
<P>
	He called it a long-term investment.  
</P>
<P>
	His decision proved wise after The Happy Hopper held off  
fast-closing Dreams Gallore to win the $40,000 Dixie Belle at 
Oaklawn Park by a length. 
</P>
<P>
	The Happy Hopper, who won stakes at Keeneland and Churchill  
Downs last year, was the 6-5 favorite in the field of 11 3-year-old 
fillies. Owned by Kerry and Linda Ozment and trained by Bob 
Holthus, The Happy Hopper returned $4.60, $3.00 and $2.40. 
</P>
<P>
	Dreams Gallore, ridden by Glen Murphy, paid $3.00 and $2.60. It  
was seven lengths back to Stormin Hanna, who returned $3.40. 
</P>
<P>
	The Happy Hopper covered the six furlongs in 1:11 4-5 on a muddy  
track. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dixie Belle began as a 5 1/2-furlong event in 1979, but racing  
secretary Pat Pope added 110 yards to the race this year to help 
the fillies get a head start on preparations for longer races. 
</P>
<P>
	``I kinda appreciated that,'' Holthus said. He said she had  
trained well on an off track and that her sire had no trouble with 
such conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would have been very disappointed had she not run well,'' he  
said.

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- A leading human rights activist who wanted  
the Mexican government to clean up organized crime in drug-ridden 
northern Sinaloa state has been shot to death, authorities said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Jorge Aguirre Meza, a lawyer and president of the state bar, was  
among four activists who campaigned against police torture and 
abuse in 1990, leading to the creation of the National Human Rights 
Commission. He is the third of the four activists to be killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Four men dressed in black and wearing ski masks ambushed Aguirre  
Meza outside his home in the Sinaloa town of Navolato late 
Wednesday. He died from bullet wounds to the head a few hours 
later.

	BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) -- Rampant forest fires subsided  
Friday after high winds feeding the flames diminished and switched 
directions Friday in southwest Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said the calming winds had helped firefighters tame  
the blaze which began spreading through this mountainous area a 
week ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Jorge Amado, a provincial civil defense official, said the focal  
points of the fire had been ``contained.'' However, he cautioned 
that ``the fires were not totally controlled.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Firefighters worked through the night as the blaze cast a bright  
orange backdrop on the resort town of Bariloche, nestled at the 
foot of the Andes mountains 1,100 miles from Buenos Aires. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents of the surrounding areas used blankets and shovels to  
smother the smaller flames, while authorities fought bigger flames.

be allowed to return home Friday.

	SAN JOSE, Costa Rica (AP) -- The Inter-American Human Rights  
Court heard final arguments Friday in a case against the Guatemalan 
government for the torture and deaths of five street children. 
</P>
<P>
	Four street youths, ages 15 to 19 were kidnapped June 15, 1990  
by Guatemalan police. Their bodies were found days later. They had 
been shot and their bodies showed signs of torture. The body of a 
fifth teen, who apparently had been killed by police, was found 10 
days later. 
</P>
<P>
	Government representatives asked the court to dismiss the case  
on procedural grounds, arguing that the plaintiffs -- child rights 
activists -- had not exhausted all legal recourses available in 
Guatemala. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors argued that there was ample evidence that the police  
had tortured and killed the youths. 
</P>
<P>
	A ruling is expected sometime after the court convenes again in  
May. The court could require the government to pay damages to the 
victims' family.

	The increase was led by manufactured goods, which rose 12.5  
percent to $1.19 billion, representing almost half of all 
Salvadoran exports.

	Coffee exports fell 38 percent, or $196 million, the result of a

<HEADLINE> Lakers' Bryant Signs New Contract </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- Kobe Bryant signed a six-year contract  
extension with the Los Angeles Lakers on Friday believed to be 
worth nearly $71 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant, who doesn't turn 21 until August, has one year remaining  
on the contract he signed before his rookie season in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The extension starts with next season, and runs through the  
2004-2005 season. Once it takes effect, Bryant will be the

	``He's going to continue to improve and make us a better team as

<P>
	It's believed Bryant will earn the maximum allowable under the

<HEADLINE> FCC Won't Regulate Cable Sharing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal regulators for now will not begin a  
process that would force cable companies to share their high-speed 
lines with competitors. But the government closely will monitor the 
situation to ensure consumers' options for Internet service are not 
restricted. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Communications Commission, in a report to Congress  
on the availability of high-speed connections, did not recommend an 
inquiry on the matter of mandatory access to cable's high-speed 
lines, Larry Strickling, chief of the agency's Common Carrier 
Bureau, said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer groups, public interest advocates, America Online and  
others had pressed the FCC to require cable companies to give other 
companies access to those lines to offer competing services. 
</P>
<P>
	The cable industry did not want the FCC to act.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're pleased the commission decided to continue to let the  
marketplace work without regulatory intervention,'' said Decker 
Anstrom, president of the National Cable Television Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Access to the technology has pitted the cable industry against  
AOL and consumer and interest groups, and it has produced an 
intense lobbying battle over the language to be included in the 
report. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a serious issue,'' said FCC Chairman Bill Kennard.  
``And it's one that I believe we should continue to monitor very 
closely.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although the FCC adopted the congressionally mandated report  
Thursday, it will not be released until next week, commission 
spokesman David Fiske said. 
</P>
<P>
	Businesses now wanting access to cable companies' high-speed  
lines must negotiate agreements with them. The cable industry 
favors continuation of this voluntary approach. 
</P>
<P>
	Cable, satellite, telephone and wireless companies -- using a  
wide variety of technologies -- are in a race against each other to 
offer high-speed connections that would allow customers to receive 
data at speeds considerably faster than normal phone lines. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew Schwartzman, president of the Media Access Project, which  
wants the FCC to require cable companies to provide access to 
rivals, noted that the FCC did not rule out regulatory action in 
the future. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL said it would continue to work with the FCC on the question.  
</P>
<P>
	Overall, Strickling said the report does not recommend that the  
FCC open any new regulatory proceedings involving deployment of 
high-speed connections. 
</P>
<P>
	The report also does not make recommendations concerning AT&AMP;T's  
takeover of cable giant Tele-Communications Inc., Strickling said. 
Opponents want the FCC to condition that merger on TCI providing 
rivals with access to its high-speed lines, something analysts 
predict is unlikely to happen. 
</P>
<P>
	The report concludes that high-speed connections are being made  
available to Americans at a brisk pace, even in some rural areas.

<HEADLINE> Asian Stock Markets Close Mixed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Asian stock markets ended the week generally  
mixed Friday, with share prices rising in Tokyo and Hong Kong, but 
falling in Manila and Taipei. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo's benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 156.93  
points, or 1.09 percent, to finish the day at 14,499.25 points. On 
Thursday, the average closed down 107.74 points, or 0.75 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares prices rose as a weaker yen and an overnight rise on Wall  
Street boosted shares in blue-chip exporters. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. dollar was quoted at 115.98 yen in midafternoon  
trading, up 0.52 yen from late Thursday in Tokyo but below its late 
New York level of 116.40 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	A lower yen makes Japanese exports cheaper abroad, and thus more  
competitive. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of major banks rose on hopes they will soon make detailed  
requests for public funds to boost their capital bases, and amid 
news of several alliances in the banking sector. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's two main banking conglomerates, the Mitsubishi Group and  
the Sumitomo Group, announced Friday they were in talks to form an 
alliance in the pension business. 
</P>
<P>
	Share prices in Hong Kong rebounded on the back of an overnight  
rally on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hang Seng Index, the Hong Kong market's key indicator of  
blue chips, rose 145.94 points, or 1.6 percent, closing at 
9,506.90. On Thursday, the index had tumbled 358.70 points, or 3.7 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Brokers said share prices rose on selective bargain-hunting  
following Thursday's sharp falls. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hong Kong market was also boosted by Thursday's rally on  
Wall Street, where the Dow Jones industrial average rose 81.10 
points -- or by 0.9 percent -- at 9,281.33. 
</P>
<P>
	Philippine shares closed lower on disappointing economic data  
that showed a 0.1 percent expansion in the country's gross national 
product, much lower than the 0.8 percent the government was 
projecting and a far cry from the 5.8 percent GNP growth rate 
posted by the country in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The 30-company Philippine Stock Exchange Index closed 44.66  
points, or 2.2 percent, to 1,954.15. 
</P>
<P>
	In Taipei, share prices closed lower on continued concerns over  
Taiwan's economy. The market's key Weighted Stock Price Index fell 
79.41 points, or 1.30 percent, to 5,984.00, its lowest close since 
July 16, 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:  
</P>
<P>
	WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed higher, spurred on  
by strength in market bellwether stock Telecom Corp. of New Zealand 
Ltd. The benchmark NZSE-40 Capital Index rose 17.41 points, or 0.8 
percent to 2,79.53. 
</P>
<P>
	SYDNEY: A buoyant banking and finance sector helped the  
Australian share market to a stronger close. The benchmark All 
Ordinaries Index rose 16.6 points, or 0.5 percent, to at 2,893.8. 
</P>
<P>
	SEOUL: Share prices closed mixed. The Korea Composite Stock  
Price Index slipped 0.04 point to 571.43. 
</P>
<P>
	SINGAPORE: Share prices closed mixed in lackluster trading. The  
key Straits Times Index rose 2.12 points, or 0.1 percent, to 
1,428.14. 
</P>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian share prices closed lower as investors  
stay away due the absence of fresh leads and ahead of a long 
weekend. The Composite Index, which tracks 100 key stocks, fell 
4.02 points, or 0.6 percent, to 591.43. 
</P>
<P>
	JAKARTA: Indonesian share prices closed higher in moderate  
trading. The Composite Index rose 4.661 points, or 1.1 percent, to 
411.932. 
</P>
<P>
	BANGKOK: Thai share prices closed mostly lower. The Stock  
Exchange of Thailand (SET) index fell 3.16 points, or 0.8 percent, 
to 363.00.

<HEADLINE> SEC Suspends Trading in 6 Stocks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Securities and Exchange Commission  
suspended until Feb. 11 trading in shares of six small companies, 
an unusually high number of such trading halts in one day. 
</P>
<P>
	In six separate announcements today, the SEC said it took the  
actions because of questions about the accuracy of the official 
company statements. 
</P>
<P>
	The trading halts are standard 10-day suspensions, and will  
continue through 11:59 p.m. EST on Feb. 11. At that time the 
stocks, unless they're subject to a further suspension, can resume 
trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the SEC did not elaborate, it is assumed an  
investigation of each company was under way. SEC spokesmen declined 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	A recent report by MSNBC columnist Christopher Byron claimed the  
six companies are secretly linked and have seen their share prices 
soar, creating a combined market capitalization of $1.2 billion 
``out of nothing but hot air and empty press releases.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC's announcements did indicate a link between two of the  
companies, Citron Inc. and Invest Holdings Group Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies' shares are traded on the National Association of  
Securities Dealer OTC Bulletin Board, a trading system for small 
stocks that have very low volume. 
</P>
<P>
	They are:  
</P>
<P>
	--USA Talks.com Inc., based in San Diego, Calif., which describes  
itself as an Internet-based long-distance telephone service. 
</P>
<P>
	--Citron Inc., based in Denver, which describes itself as an  
Internet marketing company. 
</P>
<P>
	--Smartek Inc., based in Idaho, which says it is involved in  
wholesale menswear and federally subsidized housing. 
</P>
<P>
	--Electronic Transfer Associates Inc., based in Colorado, which  
describes itself as an Internet-related sales company. 
</P>
<P>
	--Polus Inc., based in Colorado, which the SEC says has no  
apparent business operations. 
</P>
<P>
	--Invest Holdings Group Inc., based in Colorado, which says it  
develops and sells health maintenance products. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC said questions have been raised about the accuracy of  
Invest Holdings' public statements concerning, among other things, 
the efficacy of its products and its business relationship with 
Citron.

<HEADLINE> FBI Hears Councilman on Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Former City Councilman Tom Godfrey has  
told his story of the nervous Salt Lake Olympics official with the 
large bag of cash to the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
	Godfrey told FBI agents Wednesday night what he had told  
reporters earlier in the week: A bid committee staff member told 
him of carrying $50,000 in cash to Budapest, Hungary, in 1995 just 
before the 2002 Winter Games were awarded. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Thursday he promised the FBI agents he would not  
disclose what he told them. 
</P>
<P>
	But he recounted the conversation he said occurred in the summer  
of 1996, when he and the man were reminiscing about what they had 
been doing the year before. Godfrey, who was a councilman at the 
time and traveled to Budapest, has declined to name the man. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was saying that his trip to Budapest was a bit  
uncomfortable because he had to carry $50,000 in cash. So it wasn't 
a pleasant flight for him,'' Godfrey said. ``He didn't say what it 
was for. He said he gave it to another staff member for expenses 
and that was it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Godfrey said he didn't press the man for details, but after  
revelations that Salt Lake's bid committee lavishly courted 
International Olympic Committee members before the IOC vote, the 
information seemed more interesting, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides the Justice Department, an ethics panel for the Salt  
Lake Organizing Committee and the United States Olympic Committee 
are investigating the extravagant payments, gifts, free medical 
care and scholarships for IOC relatives. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC during the weekend said its investigation found Salt  
Lake's bid committee spent more than $800,000, including cash 
payments, on 14 specific IOC members. 
</P>
<P>
	In other developments:  
</P>
<P>
	-- The IOC's chief investigator said his inquiry now was  
``looking at some of the other members'' in connection with several 
Olympic bidders, including Salt Lake. 
</P>
<P>
	Dick Pound, an IOC vice president from Canada, said ``an  
indefinite number'' of new targets had been added to the 
investigation since the report of the initial phase was released 
Sunday. He said Salt Lake remained under investigation in addition 
to Sydney, the 2000 Summer Games host city, and probably also would 
include Toronto's unsuccessful bid for the 1996 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	The Washington Post said today that at least three new names of  
IOC members were now under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound also said he expected that any reinstatement by the full  
membership of IOC members expelled in the Salt Lake inquiry would 
probably lead to the resignation of the committee's ruling 
executive board. ``That would be a serious point of 
non-confidence,'' Pound said. 
</P>
<P>
	--The Justice Department has issued subpoenas to the University  
of Utah, Brigham Young University, Utah Valley State College and 
Intermountain Health Care for information on IOC officials and 
relatives who attended the schools or were given medical care by 
IHC. 
</P>
<P>
	Two children of IOC members previously were identified as  
attending Utah schools. Swaziland IOC member David Sibandze's son, 
Sibo, reportedly received bachelor's and master's degrees from 
Utah. Libyan IOC member Bashir Attarabulsi's son, Suhel, said he 
attended BYU and UVSC. He said Olympic organizers paid his tuition 
bills and provided him with $700 each month for living expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	--Two proprietors of a defunct Salt Lake escort service were  
quoted by The Salt Lake Tribune as saying their escorts entertained 
IOC members at downtown hotels while they were visiting in the 
spring of 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	George and Milena Georgiev, who opened Snow White Escort  
Services in 1993, said two escorts performed stripteases for IOC 
officials. They could not say who arranged or paid for the escorts. 
</P>
<P>
	It's long been rumored that escorts were provided to IOC  
members, but officials said there never was any confirmation. KTVX 
two weeks ago quoted unidentified sources it said were close to 
SLOC and the escort industry as saying IOC members asked SLOC 
staffers both in Salt Lake City and at IOC meetings overseas to 
arrange escorts and the SLOC leaders were flabbergasted at the much 
higher cost overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Schaffer, attorney for former bid committee and SLOC leader  
Tom Welch, quoted his client as saying he knew nothing of escorts 
being provided. 
</P>
<P>
	--USA Today said Welch and IOC member Jean-Claude Ganga of the  
Republican of Congo shared a bank account. Schaffer said Welch's 
name was on the account so Welch could procure funds for him from 
the account in the event Ganga was out of the country. He said 
Welch said he never made a deposit or withdrawal from the account. 
</P>
<P>
	An IOC report said Ganga received $216,000 in gifts and payments  
from Salt Lake organizers. He is among those facing ouster from the 
IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Ganga said in an interview with the French newspaper  
Liberation that he had 40 votes lined up for his reinstatement at a 
special IOC session in March. He also said IOC president Juan 
Antonio Samaranch was sacrificing friends in the scandal to try to 
clear his own name. 
</P>
<P>
	--Utah Senate President Lane Beattie echoed earlier comments made  
by Gov. Mike Leavitt that the state has a ``moral obligation'' 
stand behind its agreement to indemnify Salt Lake City against any 
financial losses related to the games. 
</P>
<P>
	House Speaker Marty Stephens said it would be impossible for the  
Legislature to demand more oversight to make sure the games come in 
on budget. ``SLOC is a private entity,'' said Stephens. ``As far as 
the day-to-day management, the oversight of the games as far as 
membership on the board, I think that's inappropriate for 
legislators.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--KTVX said a Browning rifle given to Samaranch by Salt Lake  
organizers is worth much more than the $671 listed. Leon Burrows, 
who designed the gun's engraving, told the television station the 
gun could sell for up to $25,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The gold in the engraving cost $3,000 alone, Burrows said, but  
the special design depicting a smiling Samaranch alongside the 
IOC's first president makes the rifle worth much more. Burrows also 
said he engraved a second gun for SLOC, although he does not know 
what happened to it.

<P>
	LIMA, Pa. (AP) -- A car went out of control Friday afternoon and  
crashed into a tree, killing five teen-age girls on their way back 
from a shopping trip. 
</P>
<P>
	The car crossed the median strip, swerved back into the  
northbound lanes and hit a dirt embankment. It then rolled on its 
side and crashed into a tree, according to a state police report. 
</P>
<P>
	The cause of the crash was not known, but investigators said the  
driver was likely speeding. 
</P>
<P>
	``Were they going faster than 55? It's a pretty good guess to  
say yes,'' Trooper Joseph McCunney said.

<HEADLINE> Cost of NFL Franchise Zooms to $1B </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Like an out-of-control slot machine with bells  
ringing and sirens whining, the pricetag of an NFL expansion 
franchise seems headed straight for the ultimate jackpot -- $1 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Nobody was blinking at that number as two ownership groups  
representing Los Angeles and one from Houston laid out their plans 
before the NFL expansion and stadium committees, meeting at the 
Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Certainly, it seems a logical progression from the $530 million  
the expansion Cleveland Browns cost Alfred Lerner and Carmen Policy 
in September and the $800 million Howard Milstein and Daniel Snyder 
bid for the Washington Redskins this month. 
</P>
<P>
	The Milstein-Snyder bid remains on hold as the NFL finance  
committee seeks a way to include John Cooke, son of the late owner 
Jack Kent Cooke, in the ownership. No decision was reached on that 
issue after the committee met first with executors of the team and 
then Milstein and Snyder. 
</P>
<P>
	The same was true for the two LA groups -- one headed by Michael  
Ovitz that seeks to build a stadium in Carson, Calif., and the 
other by Ed Roski and Eli Broad, who hope to renovate the existing 
LA Coliseum -- and the Houston bidders headed by Robert McNair. 
</P>
<P>
	Both cities lost previous NFL teams. LA has been without a  
franchise since the Raiders returned to Oakland and the Rams moved 
to St. Louis, both in 1995. The Houston Oilers left for Tennessee 
in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The return of the Browns next season puts membership at 31  
franchises, an unwieldy number for scheduling purposes. The league 
has said it wants a 32nd team to begin play in 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	McNair believes the committee has a basic problem on its hands.  
``I think the NFL wants to be back in Houston and wants to be in 
Los Angeles and is trying to figure out how to do that,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	That's not his problem. He has put together what he believes to  
be the most attractive offer. And he brought along evidence -- an 
$85,000 scale model of his planned retractable roof stadium to show 
off to the owners. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a complete package,'' he said. ``I can't speak for the  
other two proposals but with the advantage of $300 to $375 million 
in place that the others don't have, that's a tremendous advantage. 
If a team has to take on a huge debt, it will be in the red all the 
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Broad was ready to match bottom lines with ther Houston group.  
</P>
<P>
	``We've got $350 million in public funding for infrastructure  
and a 55-year lease at a nominal amount,'' he said. ``LA is the 
place. It's the second largest media market. It needs football.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ovitz agreed, except about who ought to bring the NFL back to  
the area. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were very pleasant,'' he said of his meeting with the  
committee. ``We've delivered every environmental letter they 
needed. There was a very detailed discussion of finances. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have any inclination other than to bring football back  
to LA.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Kraft, owner of the New England Patriots and co-chairman  
of the committee, complimented the three groups. 
</P>
<P>
	``We heard three excellent presentations that spoke to the issue  
of financing,'' he said. ``It gives us three wonderful options to 
deliver our product into each market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We have some work to do as a committee,'' Kraft said. ``This  
is a big commitment of between $750 million and $1 billion. The 
good news is whoever winds up with it, there will be a passion for 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both the expansion-stadium committee and the finance committee  
will report at the next owners' meeting Feb. 16 in Atlanta, but no 
final decisions are expected until the March meeting in Phoenix.

<HEADLINE> Debunking Internet Health Alarms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An e-mail campaign attacking an artificial  
sweetener was spreading fear fast: ``Could I have been 
misdiagnosed? Will eliminating the aspartame in my diet eliminate 
the MS symptoms?'' a panicked patient asked the Multiple Sclerosis 
Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	Absolutely not, the MS Foundation replied, furious that whoever  
wrote the e-mail not only frightened vulnerable patients but 
falsely used the group's name as part of the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been completely inundated with calls about this,'' said  
the MS Foundation's Cliff Roer. ``It was very alarming.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Welcome to the latest health scare on the Internet, where e-mail  
or ``consumer alerts'' can suddenly spark panic by blaring about 
``DEADLY POISONS.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I call them toxic terrorists,'' said Jeff Stier of the  
American Council on Science and Health. He investigated after his 
New York City group got calls from frightened Internet users last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer scares are nothing new, but the Internet lets rumors  
spread faster -- and archives them forever, he said. ``It's so easy 
to play on people's fears.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The scare du jour is over claims that aspartame, sold under such  
brand names as NutraSweet, causes MS or another disease, lupus. 
</P>
<P>
	For the record, the Food and Drug Administration says that is  
false. MS and lupus have been around a lot longer than aspartame 
has, and repeated scientific studies have found no connection 
between the sweetener and such symptoms. An MS Foundation 
neurologist also investigated and calls the allegations ``rabidly 
inaccurate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But it is not the only scare.  
</P>
<P>
	Last fall, a ``Shampoo Alert'' claimed an ingredient that helps  
the suds form in almost every shampoo is really an ``engine 
degreaser'' that causes cancer. Today, Internet chat rooms still 
show people asking if they should toss their shampoo. In fact, the 
ingredient might irritate your eyes or your skin, but cancer 
experts agree there is no sign it is carcinogenic. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is something we're going to see a lot more of,''  
cautioned Dr. Randolph Wykoff of the FDA, which received more than 
100 questions about the shampoo scare and dozens so far about 
aspartame. 
</P>
<P>
	The Internet is full of important, even lifesaving, medical  
information, Wykoff stressed. The quandary is one of consumer 
savvy: How do you filter out the exaggerations, misinterpretations 
or falsehoods? 
</P>
<P>
	For people searching for information on the Internet, it is less  
of a problem: Just use Web sites operated by reputable groups such 
as the National Institutes of Health or medical journals, and be 
wary of cure-all claims. 
</P>
<P>
	The bigger question is what to believe when an alarming e-mail  
shows up unsolicited -- but with just enough science to sound 
credible, and then snowballs into frightened discussions on 
Internet bulletin boards. 
</P>
<P>
	Take aspartame, which long has been controversial.  
</P>
<P>
	Some people do say they are sensitive to it. But the FDA insists  
that 20 years of research has not found evidence of serious side 
effects -- except in some people with the rare genetic disease PKU 
or phenylketonuria, who cannot properly process an aspartame 
component called phenylalinine. 
</P>
<P>
	The new scare, however, argues that aspartame causes MS and  
lupus symptoms by breaking down into toxic methanol. Attempts to 
find the e-mail's author have failed. 
</P>
<P>
	Very high doses of methanol can be toxic, but aspartame causes  
only the same tiny amounts you would get from fruits or vegetables 
such as tomatoes and tomato juice, which also produce methanol 
during digestion, said FDA food safety expert Dr. David Hattan. 
</P>
<P>
	Both MS and lupus are diseases that wax and wane, so if a person  
felt better or worse in connection with how much diet cola she 
drank, it is pure coincidence, Wykoff added. 
</P>
<P>
	But how is a consumer to sort out such claims?  
</P>
<P>
	Call your doctor, check science books in libraries or on  
science-based Web sites, or call reputable consumer groups. 
</P>
<P>
	Remember, ``if there's a breakthrough, they're not going to read  
it in a secret message on the Internet,'' says Dr. John Renner of 
the National Council for Reliable Health Information.

<HEADLINE> Settlement Reached in Woodward Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Former British au pair Louise Woodward can't  
profit from selling her story, under a settlement reached Friday 
with the family who sued her for the wrongful death of the 
8-month-old boy who was in her care. 
</P>
<P>
	``The goal of this case is what is was from the beginning, that  
Louise Woodward would not become a millionaire,'' said Fredric 
Ellis, the lawyer for Drs. Sunil and Deborah Eappen. ``The goal of 
this lawsuit was to use the civil justice system to accomplish 
something the criminal justice system couldn't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A jury found Ms. Woodward guilty last year of second-degree  
murder in the 1997 death of 8-month-old Matthew Eappen. But a judge 
reduced the conviction to manslaughter and she was released after 
serving 279 days in prison. She was allowed to return home to 
Elton, England, in June. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday's agreement stipulates that Ms. Woodward donate any money  
she gets from the case to the international children's charity 
UNICEF. If Ms. Woodward tries to keep any money herself, the 
Eappens would go to court to demand the money be given to a 
nonprofit foundation established in their baby's name. 
</P>
<P>
	Legal experts debated whether any ban on profits ordered by a  
U.S. court could be enforced in England. But Ellis said the 
confidential agreement is enforceable overseas because it was 
written in the form of a contract with the help of international 
legal experts. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Barrow, Ms. Woodward's lawyer in England, said the ruling  
had little meaning. 
</P>
<P>
	``Louise has always maintained that she has no intention to  
profit from her story, and Louise continued to maintain her 
innocence,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal does not apply to Ms. Woodward's parents, Gary and  
Susan Woodward, who accepted a $60,000 payment from the Daily Mail, 
a British tabloid, after their daughter was first convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	The case began in February 1997 when Ms. Woodward, then 18 and  
caring for the Eappens' two young boys -- Matthew and his then 
2 1/2-year-old brother, Brendan -- called police to say the baby had 
stopped breathing. 
</P>
<P>
	Matthew was hospitalized in a coma and died five days later.  
Prosecutors said the infant had been shaken and his head violently 
smashed against a hard object. Ms. Woodward's lawyers argued that 
the injury happened weeks before he was hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
	The Eappens initially asked for several million dollars in  
compensatory and punitive damages. Ms. Woodward first ignored the 
civil suit and was found in default, and a federal judge said she 
would be liable for the damages. 
</P>
<P>
	But the judge later allowed a trial to determine how much Ms.  
Woodward should pay.

<HEADLINE> Witnesses To Be Deposed on Monday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Split along party lines, the  
Republican-controlled Senate voted to recess President Clinton's 
impeachment trial for a week while prosecutors and White House 
lawyers depose Monica Lewinsky and two other witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The resolution adopted by a 54-44 margin late Thursday envisions  
a final vote on the impeachment articles by noon Feb. 12. 
</P>
<P>
	The depositions will begin Monday, when House prosecutors and  
President Clinton's lawyers will question Ms. Lewinsky, with one 
senator from each party presiding. 
</P>
<P>
	Next Tuesday and Wednesday, the managers and White House  
attorneys will question Vernon Jordan, a Washington power broker 
and confidant of Clinton, and White House aide Sidney Blumenthal. 
It was not immediately known which of the two men would go first. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 18 hours in advance of each deposition, the Republican  
House managers must provide the president's lawyers copies of all 
exhibits which would be entered into the record during the 
deposition. 
</P>
<P>
	The depositions will be videotaped and transcripts made. Those  
records will be confidential until and unless the Senate votes to 
make them public. 
</P>
<P>
	Questions limited to matters already on record in the articles  
of impeachment. House managers will not be allowed to ask, for 
example, about any women besides Ms. Lewinsky and Paula Jones with 
whom Clinton has been linked. 
</P>
<P>
	Any objections raised but not resolved during the depositions  
would be referred to the full Senate when the trial resumes at 1 
p.m. EST on Feb. 4. Any requests for additional witnesses or 
discovery would require the agreement of the Senate Republican and 
Democratic leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	Once those issues are resolved the Senate would act on any  
motions to call witnesses to testify in the Senate chamber. 
</P>
<P>
	The president's lawyers then would have 24 hours to ask for  
additional witnesses and discovery. 
</P>
<P>
	After any additional testimony each side would have three hours  
for final arguments with the president's lawyers going first. 
</P>
<P>
	After the closing arguments, the Senate would vote on a motion  
to have its deliberations on a verdict open to the public. 
</P>
<P>
	The deliberations then would lead to a vote no later than noon  
Feb. 12.

<HEADLINE> Dole Asks More Veterans' Benefits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Former Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole told  
Congress today that it is long past time to boost benefits for the 
nation's 26 million veterans. ``It's not a very complicated issue. 
It's just about doing the right thing,'' Dole said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kansas Republican testified before a Senate panel in behalf  
of a bipartisan commission's recommendations for sweeping increases 
in military and veterans' benefits, including a new GI Bill 
promising full college scholarships in exchange for four years of 
active duty. 
</P>
<P>
	Dole, a badly wounded World War II veteran who quit the Senate  
in 1996 to devote full time to being the GOP presidential nominee, 
sponsored the legislation that created the commission. 
</P>
<P>
	He took a new swipe at Hollywood in his testimony -- accusing the  
movie industry of being stingy when it came to contributions to 
veterans' causes, including a World War II memorial to be built in 
the nation's capital. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've made a lot of money making World War II movies,'' Dole  
said. ``So far, they've kept it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dole, whose right arm was permanently disabled by wounds  
suffered fighting in Italy in 1945, is overseeing a fund-raising 
drive to raise $100 million to build the memorial on Washington's 
National Mall. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, he said, about $40 million has been raised.  
</P>
<P>
	Despite his poke at the film industry, Dole said that actor Tom  
Hanks, who starred in last year's hit about World War II, ``Saving 
Private Ryan,'' had helped personally in soliciting funds for the 
memorial and ``he's going to do some public-service 
announcements.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There are about 6.5 million World War II veterans.  
</P>
<P>
	Dole testified before the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee on  
recommendations by a 12-member panel seeking the biggest projected 
overhaul in benefits since the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the proposals, many health benefits would be combined.  
Veterans could seek health care treatment at military hospitals and 
active military personnel could be treated in veterans hospitals. 
Veterans could again buy a home with no down payment, as in the 
early days of the VA loan program. And enlistees could invest their 
money in tax-deferred savings plans, similar to 401(k) accounts 
available in the private sector. 
</P>
<P>
	But the biggest item in the package is one that would pay full  
college tuition costs, plus a $400 monthly stipend, for veterans 
who served at least four years on active duty. 
</P>
<P>
	Furthermore, the Pentagon could transfer this benefit to other  
family members as an re-enlistment incentive. 
</P>
<P>
	Dole said the report contained a lot of good ideas, although he  
did not speak to specifics, saying he knew some of them would be 
more controversial than others. ``I know the committee will 
carefully consider the commission's report and move forward,'' Dole 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there is a special feeling of all Americans, that  
someone who volunteers and wears the uniform ... deserves some 
special recognition when they leave the service,'' Dole said. 
</P>
<P>
	``You do have a little surplus these days, which was not around  
when I was here. I know there are a million ideas for how to use 
that surplus,'' Dole said. ``Some of the things they (the 
commission) point out cost money, other things save money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This should be a real priority, in my view. Beyond that, I  
don't have any magic way to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And, noting that the committee was one that dealt exclusively  
with veterans' issues, Dole said, '' I think everyone agrees I'm 
preaching to the choir here. ''

<HEADLINE> Survey: Teachers Feel Unprepared </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Teachers who feel unprepared to cope with  
technology and diversity point to the need for more training, 
education officials and advocates say. 
</P>
<P>
	``Teacher education and professional development programs are  
not addressing the realities found in today's classrooms,'' said 
Education Secretary Richard W. Riley. 
</P>
<P>
	A department survey of 3,560 teachers in kindergarten through  
12th-grade classrooms found that only one out of five teachers felt 
``very well prepared'' to use computers in their classrooms. 
Similarly, about 20 percent felt confident in teaching bilingual or 
special education children in their classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey released Thursday asked teachers about their college  
studies, professional certificates, on-the-job training and support 
from parents and colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
	``These findings are particularly unsettling given the  
increasing diversity of our nation's students,'' said Martin Orland 
of the department's National Center for Education Statistics. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's largest teachers union said the survey shows  
teachers are dedicated to their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every day in classrooms across America, teachers and their  
students aspire to learn and achieve more,'' said Bob Chase, 
National Education Association president. ``We need to fuel that 
enthusiasm and dedication with the preparation and support teachers 
need to educate our children for the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, 38 percent of the teachers had bachelor's or master's  
degrees in a specific field, 37 percent had majored in general 
education and 18 percent had degrees in such subjects as math 
education. 
</P>
<P>
	After graduation, they were more likely to be trained in state  
or district curricula (81 percent) than in special education (48 
percent) or bilingual and diversity education (31 percent). 
</P>
<P>
	Of the teachers who had a special education or bilingual student  
in their classes, about 20 percent felt well-prepared to teach 
them. And though 78 percent of teachers reported training in 
technology, just 20 percent felt ``very well prepared'' to use it 
in their classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey also illustrates the need to change how teachers are  
trained for changing classrooms, Riley said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``One-shot workshops ... carry little relevance to teachers'  
work in the classroom,'' Riley said. He will present details of 
President Clinton's proposals for change in a speech next month in 
Long Beach, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	The department mailed out the surveys early last year; about 92  
percent of recipients responded. The typical margin of error for 
the questions asked was plus or minus 3 percentage points, Orland 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent years, the focus has shifted from student standards to  
teacher standards. States such as Florida now have incentives for 
teachers seeking better credentials. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Clinton proposed spending more than $245 million to  
hire new teachers, train teachers for impoverished school districts 
and recruit teachers for areas heavily populated by American 
Indians. Congressional Republicans started hearings on teacher 
quality this week and will make proposals by spring. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey also found that 98 percent of teachers who responded  
said they have full state certification. Only 1 percent reported 
using the emergency teaching certificates that Clinton criticized 
in his State of the Union address. But most of those certificates 
are issued to new teachers and to teachers in schools attended 
mostly by minorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Of new teachers, only 64 percent have full state certificates.  
In contrast, 99 percent of veteran teachers do.

<HEADLINE> Seattle Gets 2001 All-Star Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Seattle's new Safeco Field, scheduled to open  
July 15, will be the site of the 2001 All-Star game, The Associated 
Press learned Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Commissioner Bud Selig and AL president Gene Budig will make the  
announcement Monday in Seattle, a baseball official said, speaking 
on the condition he not be identified. The AL confirmed news 
conference had been scheduled but would not identify the subject. 
</P>
<P>
	The specific date for the All-Star game has not been set, but it  
most likely will be July 10, 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Detroit's Comerica Park, which opens in 2000, was considered the  
co-favorite along with Seattle. Baseball intends to use its new 
ballparks for All-Star games in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's All-Star game is scheduled for Boston's Fenway Park  
on July 13 and the 2000 game will at at Atlanta's Turner Field. The 
American and National leagues alternates as the hosts. 
</P>
<P>
	Anaheim, Kansas City, the New York Yankees and Tampa Bay also  
formally or informally expressed an interest in staging the 2001 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	Seattle will be the All-Star site for the second time. The 50th  
All-Star game was held at the Kingdome in 1979, with the NL winning 
7-6. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mariners will begin their 23rd season in the Kingdome, their  
home since they joined the AL in 1977, and will play 39 of their 81 
home dates there before moving into their new $498 million 
ballpark, which has a retractable roof. 
</P>
<P>
	While the All-Star game will be in Seattle in 2001, it's not  
clear if Ken Griffey Jr. and Alex Rodriguez will be. Both are 
eligible for free agency after the 2000 season.

	Sources: Reno Rejects Ickes Probe  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Attorney General Janet Reno today rejected  
calling an independent counsel to investigate former White House 
aide Harold Ickes. Reno filed the decision with a special court 
just minutes prior to the court's closing for the weekend. Today 
was the last day of Reno's six-month-long review of an allegation 
that Ickes lied before a Senate inquiry into campaign finances. 
That's the maximum time she is allowed under the independent 
counsel act. Ickes has denied wrongdoing.

	Senate Delivering Trial Subpoenas  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate began delivering subpoenas today  
for Monica Lewinsky and two others who will testify next week in 
depositions for President Clinton's impeachment trial. Long-time 
Clinton friend Vernon Jordan and aide Sidney Blumenthal will also 
testify. GOP senators have promised that the trial will end by Feb. 
12 -- unless more witnesses are called -- with a vote on perjury and 
obstruction of justice charges against Clinton. The White House 
criticized what it called make-it-up-as-you-go rules and 
resurrected the argument that Republicans were playing politics. 

</P>
<P>
	Clinton Seeks Drug Prevention Money  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House drug policy office plans to  
ask Congress for more money this year to boost prevention and 
treatment. The Clinton Administration wants to boost programs like 
methadone treatment of heroin addiction, drug courts and prison 
testing. But Republicans say they would like more focus on 
eradicating illegal narcotics at their source.

Kosovo and virtually ignoring the brutal killings in his West 
African nation. More than 2,000 people have been killed in a year 
of fighting between separatist guerrillas and Yugoslav and Serbian 
forces in Kosovo. In Sierra Leone, between 2,000 and 3,000 people 
have been killed since rebels renewed their offensive in December. 
The Security Council last week issued a statement expressing 
``grave concern'' about the situation in Sierra Leone.

	Cops: Clinic Bombing Done by Remote  
</P>
<P>
	BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) -- Authorities tried today to discredit  
suspected abortion clinic bomber Eric Rudolph, saying the fugitive 
had waited with a remote control and detonated a bomb as two people 
drew near. ``Eric Rudolph is not a folk hero,'' a police spokesman 
said. Authorities said Rudolph, who is believed to be hiding in the 
mountains of North Carolina, used timers in three bombings in 
Atlanta, including the 1996 Olympic Park bombing that killed one 
person. Anti-abortion sentiment and distrust of the federal 
government run high in the North Carolina mountains, where many 
locals have said they would help Rudolph if he came to them.

cocaine-smuggling trial. Jurors in the new case sent a note saying 
they were ``at each other's throats.'' The judge dismissed the jury 
in the trial of Miguel ``Mike'' Moya, who was accused of taking 
nearly $500,000 to sell his vote in a 1996 verdict. Prosecutors 
said Moya took the money to vote innocent in the trial of reputed 
drug kingpins Augusto ``Willie'' Falcon and Salvador ``Sal'' 
Magluta. The pair were acquitted in February 1996 of charges they 
smuggled 75 tons of cocaine from Colombia into the United States.

<HEADLINE> Philip Morris Funding 4-H Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A well-known national youth group is developing  
a program to discourage youngsters from smoking but plans to 
finance the effort with money from the tobacco company behind the 
Marlboro Man. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials of the National 4-H Council, the private fund-raiser  
for 4-H programs nationwide, said Friday that the nation's biggest 
tobacco company, Philip Morris USA, has committed $4.3 million over 
two years for the program. 
</P>
<P>
	But anti-tobacco activists say Philip Morris is trying to use  
the youth group's good name to create a false impression that it is 
serious about discouraging underage smoking. 
</P>
<P>
	The news comes even as the Justice Department examines the  
possibility of suing the tobacco industry to recover costs of 
treating sick smokers. Philip Morris and three other tobacco 
companies have settled similar claims by the states by agreeing to 
pay $246 billion over 25 years and curb marketing activities that 
critics say entice children to smoke. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, Philip Morris announced plans in December to spend  
about $100 million this year on advertising, education and 
community-based programs to discourage children from smoking. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokeswoman Mary Carnovale said the 4-H deal is part of that  
campaign. She said Philip Morris is also working with others on 
anti-smoking programs but declined to identify them. Philip Morris 
denies it markets cigarettes to kids. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Sauer, president of the National 4-H Council, said 4-H  
program officials decided to design a smoking prevention program 
after youngsters identified health and smoking in an August meeting 
as a key concern. 
</P>
<P>
	Details of the program have not been worked out but it will be  
aimed at middle-school children -- generally ages 9 to 13. 
</P>
<P>
	Sauer said council officials approached Philip Morris about  
supporting the effort at the suggestion of a council member who 
works for Kraft Foods, which shares the same corporate parent as 
the tobacco company. 
</P>
<P>
	Sauer said he was clear in several meetings with Philip Morris  
executives that ``we would try to reduce their business in the 
United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We have complete independence. They are not going to tell us  
how to do it or what to do,'' Sauer said in a telephone interview 
from Chevy Chase, Md. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Philip Morris asked only that the programs can  
``demonstrate an impact.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carnovale said Philip Morris would ``be but one person at the  
table'' as the 4-H group develops specific programs. ``We have a 
lot to learn about this, but we feel we can play a very important 
role,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	To date, Philip Morris is the only corporate backer of the 4-H  
smoking prevention effort. Its commitment is among the biggest 
corporate grants to the 4-H Council. 
</P>
<P>
	Anti-smoking activists argued against the arrangement.  
</P>
<P>
	``We are concerned that by partnering with reputable  
organizations like the 4-H, Philip Morris will gain a degree of 
legitimacy that will enable it to continue its ways: addicting 
millions of kids to tobacco as it has done for decades,'' William 
D. Novelli, head of the Campiagn for Tobacco-Free Kids, wrote Sauer 
in a letter earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Sauer said his group is being unfairly prejudged by such  
critics. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have no guarantees, but we think it is worth the gamble  
because if we can save the life of even one young person, it's 
worth it,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> German Industrial Workers Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BONN, Germany (AP) -- From shipyards to auto factories, more than  
200,000 German industrial workers nationwide walked off their jobs 
Friday to press demands for higher pay. 
</P>
<P>
	With contract negotiations between employers and IG Metall union  
representatives deadlocked, the union called for protests after a 
no-strike pledge expired at midnight Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Just as the deadline passed, workers at a Mercedes plant in the  
western city of Kassel abandoned the night shift. DaimlerChrysler 
workers in Bremen, in the north, held aloft torches and banners 
during a pre-dawn rally. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our members are outraged,'' said Hartmut Meine, a union  
official in Lower Saxony state, where 4,000 workers quit working at 
4 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	At the day's biggest rally, nearly 20,000 DaimlerChrysler  
workers hoisted banners demanding raises in Sindelfingen in the 
southwestern state of Baden-Wuerttemberg, a focus of the strikes. 
</P>
<P>
	Union officials have called for ``warning strikes,'' walkouts  
lasting only a day or even a few hours. But preparations are 
continuing for a full-scale strike by IG Metall's 2.7 million 
members if pay bargaining, which continued Friday, remained at a 
standstill. 
</P>
<P>
	Germany's Social Democrat-led government, torn between loyalty  
to labor and its own efforts to talk industry into creating more 
jobs, has stayed out of the dispute so far. 
</P>
<P>
	IG Metall, Germany's largest union, is demanding a 6.5 percent  
wage increase for 1998; employers have offered two percent and a 
one-time payment of 0.5 percent of annual wages, dependent on each 
company's financial health. IG Metall also says workers deserve a 
greater share of company profits after several years of wage 
restraint. 
</P>
<P>
	The old contract, which expired Dec. 31, pledged both sides to  
negotiate for four weeks before unions could call warning strikes. 
</P>
<P>
	The union says it will call a strike vote among its members  
unless there is a contract by Feb. 11.

	Nearly 40,000 workers walked out in about 120 firms in Germany's  
northern coastal region, along the Baltic and North seas. Krupp, 
VW, and Siemens production plants also were closed. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the government made it clear there would be little  
largesse for its own workers. Interior Minister Otto Schily opened 
annual wage talks with public-sector unions Friday by rejecting 
their demands for a 5.5-percent raise as ``unreasonably high.''

<HEADLINE> Democrats Seeks Secret Depositions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Democrats pressing for letting the public  
witness the Senate's deliberations in the impeachment trial of 
President Clinton are also fighting to keep secret another phase of 
the trial -- the videotaped deposition of witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic Sens. Tom Harkin of Iowa and Paul Wellstone of  
Minnesota have taken the lead in trying to prevent the Senate from 
going behind closed doors for the final debate on the impeachment 
articles. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's let the sunshine in and protect the interests of the  
American people,'' Harkin said in a statement when he and Wellstone 
announced their plan to make a motion to open final deliberations. 
``Openness will help heal our nation after this divisive episode.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But both senators also voted for a Democratic plan that would  
have prevented the videotaped depositions next week of Monica 
Lewinsky, Vernon Jordan and Sidney Blumenthal from being released 
publicly. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a hard position for them to take,'' said John Czwartacki,  
spokesman for Senate Republican leader Trent Lott. ``They are 
arguing to open the proceedings to hear senators speak, but for 
evidence and witnesses they want the whole thing shut down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harkin spokesman Patrick Dorton said the depositions should be  
kept private because they deal with ``the personal privacy of an 
individual,'' while Senate procedings are conducted by elected 
representatives. 
</P>
<P>
	``The purpose behind limiting videotape is to prevent this trial  
from being sensationalized any further,'' said Dorton. Harkin, he 
said, was unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Wellstone, likewise, wants the deliberations open so the public  
can see their representatives debate ``the value of the evidence,'' 
said his spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	``But he has always been against calling additional witnesses  
because we know everything we need to know already,'' said Jim 
Farrell. ``Having videotape of witnesses shown in the trial seems 
rather superfluous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Along party lines, the GOP-controlled Senate on Thursday  
rejected the Democratic plan to keep the tapes private. Instead, it 
adopted a Republican resolution to decide later on whether to make 
the videotapes public. Under the approved version, ``the Senate may 
direct the secretary of the Senate to distribute such materials.''

<HEADLINE> No NFL Blessing Yet for Pats' Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Gov. John G. Rowland and New England  
Patriots owner Robert Kraft have said they'll sign a deal by next 
Friday to legally commit the team to move to Hartford. 
</P>
<P>
	If they stick to that deadline, the contract will be inked  
without the National Football League's blessing. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal -- which must be approved by 24 of the NFL's 31 teams --  
will not be discussed by the football bosses before Feb. 16, when 
the league holds its next meeting in Atlanta, spokesman Greg Aiello 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``There won't be a decision before that,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	But that's no problem, the Patriots say.  
</P>
<P>
	Stacey James, a spokesman for the team, said the absence of an  
NFL vote will not hold up the development agreement. He said the 
team had expected to sign the agreement before getting NFL 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
	NFL owners gathered in Miami Thursday, but the Patriots' move  
from Foxboro, Mass., to Hartford was not scheduled to be discussed. 
</P>
<P>
	A $374 million spending bill to build the Patriots a Hartford  
stadium sailed through the General Assembly Dec. 15. 
</P>
<P>
	The development agreement was first expected to be signed Jan.  
15, but Kraft and Rowland agreed to extend the deadline to Feb. 5. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement, which will legally commit Kraft to Hartford, will  
contain all the details of the deal laid out in the framework of 
the spending bill. 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, the bill stipulates that the Patriots will manage  
the stadium. The development agreement will explain exactly how the 
stadium will be managed. The document will also have specifics 
about site acquisition, parking issues, infrastructure 
improvements, and stadium design and construction.

<HEADLINE> MD: Biology Key to Hand Transplant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Biology, not doctors, ultimately will  
determine whether Matthew Scott's hand transplant is effective, one 
of his surgeons says. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, Scott is ``pretty much on cruise control,'' Dr. Warren  
C. Breidenbach said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott, a paramedic from Absecon, N.J., received the left hand of  
a cadaver in a 14 1/2-hour operation that ended Monday morning at 
Jewish Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	At Breidenbach's prompting, he flexed his new fingertips ever so  
slightly Thursday to test tendons that control finger movement. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott, 37, lost his left hand in an accident with a powerful  
M-80 firecracker 13 years ago. He is one of two people in the world 
with a transplanted hand; the other is an Australian who underwent 
the graft in Lyon, France, in September. 
</P>
<P>
	In a brief visit with reporters and a photographer in his  
hospital room, Scott sat with his left hand and arm elevated and 
heavily bandaged, leaving the nails and tips of his fingers 
visible. He and his wife, Dawn, declined to take questions. 
</P>
<P>
	Breidenbach said Scott was being treated in two ways -- as a  
transplant patient, with an anti-rejection regimen like that of a 
kidney transplant patient, and as a limb-reattachment patient. 
</P>
<P>
	A great deal of physical therapy is ahead, but the bigger issue  
is how Scott's tendons will respond, Breidenbach said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can tell you Matt's going to give it every effort -- he's an  
excellent patient -- but the biologic process is going to ultimately 
control what happens, and we don't know. This is uncharted 
territory,'' Breidenbach said.

<HEADLINE> Falcons' Tuggle Overcome by Emotion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Jessie Tuggle waited 12 years for this moment.  
Judging by the fury in his eyes and the passion in his voice, he 
may not make it until Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Every word harbors a torrent of emotions -- excitement and  
urgency, redemption and desperation, responsibility and honor. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuggle makes it clear this Super Bowl is not just for him, and  
it's not just for his Atlanta Falcons' teammates. It's for the 
old-timers who maintained a sense of dignity in the face of defeat. 
It's for an entire city that endured three decades of miserable NFL 
football. 
</P>
<P>
	``This week is so much bigger than me,'' the linebacker said.  
``This is about all the former players that played here in Atlanta 
... like Mike Kenn and Jeff Van Note and Joel Williams and Buddy 
Curry, the guys who never had the opportunity to experience what 
I'm experiencing throughout their time in Atlanta.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tuggle is just getting warmed up.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is for the city of Atlanta -- they've been waiting for  
this for so long. This is for the Smith family (who own the team) 
and the whole organization. This is large. This is something we've 
all dreamed about and talked about and this is something that we 
really want.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At this point, Tuggle's eyes are nearly bulging out of his head,  
as if he's ready to tackle someone -- anyone -- in a Denver Broncos 
uniform. 
</P>
<P>
	``So, when we go out there and play on Super Bowl Sunday, we're  
playing for more than just 1998 football squad. We're playing for a 
lot of other people, a lot of other reasons. We want that 
championship and we want that ring.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hey, Jessie, maybe you should save some of that emotion for the  
game. But he can't help himself. He's suffered through too many 
losses, endured too much ridicule, dealt with too much pain. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll tell you what, our confidence it sky high right now,'' he  
said. ``We truly feel when we hit the football field that we can't 
be beat. And it takes that type of confidence -- it's not a 
cockiness, it's a confidence you feel -- and even when adversity 
strikes, and you're behind in the fourth quarter, you don't give 
up, you fight to the end.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That sort of attitude mirrors Tuggle's career. His name always  
seems to surface when a teammate discusses the satisfaction of 
Atlanta's first Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	A gentle, family-oriented man away from the field, Tuggle  
transforms himself on Sundays. He's the relic of a bygone era when 
rugged, angry men like Dick Butkus and Jack Lambert patrolled the 
middle linebacker position. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no doubt that Jessie has a special place in my  
heart,'' said defensive end Chuck Smith, who had been with the 
Falcons since 1992. ``He's the one guy here who always laid it on 
the line, and I knew I wanted to do that in my career. He still 
works as hard as anybody on the team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 33-year-old Tuggle takes the practice field with rookie-like  
vigor, as if he's fighting for a job every day. He still seems to 
view himself as that undersized linebacker from tiny Valdosta State 
University, the guy who wasn't even drafted in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	Twelve years later, he's proven the critics wrong. But he can't  
distance himself from those who never thought he'd make it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never take the easy way out,'' the 5-foot-11, 230-pounder  
said. ``Why take the easy way out? Just getting into this league 
was a challenge to me. I came in as the short free agent nobody 
wanted. That mentality stuck with me the whole time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want anyone to give me anything. I want to go out and  
take it. That's how it's been for me as far as wanting to be part 
of the solution for the Atlanta Falcons. It wasn't an easy fight. 
In fact, it's been an uphill fight for me. But I hung in there and 
good things started to happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though he's a five-time Pro Bowler, Tuggle never seemed to  
garner the honors or the respect that would have been his in Dallas 
or San Francisco or Green Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	No active player has more tackles than Tuggle, who has herded  
1,903 ball-carriers to the ground. For 11 years and counting, he's 
surpassed 100 tackles. Two of those seasons, he had more than 200. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jessie won't say it,'' Smith said, ``but if Jessie Tuggle was  
anywhere else the last 12 years, he'd be a guaranteed Hall of 
Famer, no questions asked. ... He's always overlooked, but there's 
not a linebacker who's played better than Jessie Tuggle since I've 
been in the league.''

<HEADLINE> Kellogg Earnings Picture Mixed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BATTLE CREEK, Mich. (AP) -- Kellogg Co.'s fourth-quarter earnings  
more than tripled compared to a year earlier, when earnings were 
depressed by huge restructuring costs. 
</P>
<P>
	But Kellogg's operating results, which exclude any such special  
costs, dropped 41 percent as the company battled lower-price cereal 
competitors and changing breakfast habits. Kellogg stock fell 3.4 
percent Friday on the news. 
</P>
<P>
	Kellogg earned $46.8 million, or 11 cents per share, in the last  
three months of 1998, which included special charges of $46.3 
million to pay for a reorganization plan. Kellogg has been laying 
off workers and trying to streamline operations to become more 
competitive. 
</P>
<P>
	The company earned $14.6 million, or 4 cents per share, for the  
same period in 1997, after incurring charges of $162.2 million to 
cover plant closings and other streamlining moves. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales slipped 1 percent to $1.60 billion from $1.62 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	Removing all special, one-time costs from both periods,  
Kellogg's earnings in the recent quarter fell to $93.1 million, or 
23 cents per share, from $158.5 million, or 39 cents a share, in 
1997. The results matched Wall Street's expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	Kellogg shares fell $1.43 3/4 to close at $40.62 1/2 a share on the  
New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't pretty, but it wasn't a surprise,'' said John  
McMillin, an analyst with Prudential Securities in New York, who 
predicted that it will be two or three years before Kellogg turns 
itself around. 
</P>
<P>
	Kellogg, which holds about 32 percent of the domestic cereal  
market, has been battered by cheaper generic and store-brand 
cereals. Busy consumers have also left cereal for foods that can be 
eaten on the run. 
</P>
<P>
	To fight those trends, Kellogg announced plans in December for  
Country Inn Specialties, a new line of upscale cereals aimed at 
creating a new market niche. It also decided to hike domestic 
cereal prices by an average of nearly 3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	For all of 1998, Kellogg's earnings fell to $502.6 million, or  
$1.23 per share, from $546 million, or $1.32 per share, in 1997. 
Sales fell to $6.76 billion from $6.83 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``While our financial results are disappointing, 1998 was a year  
in which we took critical actions to reposition our business for 
greater growth,'' said Arnold G. Langbo, Kellogg's outgoing 
chairman of the board and CEO. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, Kellogg named company president Carlos  
Gutierrez to replace Langbo as CEO in April, then take the 
chairman's title from the retiring Langbo a year later.

<HEADLINE> Porsche Recalls 4,383 Sports Cars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Porsche AG is recalling 5,383 of its 911 model  
sports cars worldwide to repair an electrical problem that can 
cause the driver's air bag to activate unintentionally. 
</P>
<P>
	The German automaker said Friday that the recall involves  
certain 1996 911 Carrera, Targa and Turbo models, including 1,968 
cars in the United States and 119 in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	Owners are being asked by mail to take their cars to their  
dealer for a free inspection and installation of a device that 
protects the air bag from voltage peaks that could cause unintended 
activation. Owners also are being asked to stop driving the car if 
the air bag warning light goes on, then to have it towed to the 
dealer. 
</P>
<P>
	In the United States, there have been 31 reports of Porsche air  
bags deploying unintentionally. Several of those deployments have 
injured the driver, but none has resulted in an accident, said 
spokesman Bob Carlson of Porsche Cars North America Inc. in 
Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	Carlson said Porsche did not have figures on how many such  
incidents had been reported elsewhere.

<HEADLINE> D.C. Mayor Chats With Residents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- About 300 men and women accepted District of  
Columbia Mayor Anthony Williams' invitation to his office to chat. 
</P>
<P>
	Drugs, crime, potholes and jobs were among issues raised by  
constituents and nonresidents alike at the event, which was billed 
as the mayor's first ``open house'' since he took office Jan. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	Keith Swann, 37, said he was there to talk about the district  
neighborhood he moved into two months ago. ``My car has already 
been stolen, and then when I was riding around looking for it I 
came across an open-air drug market,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to ask him if he's doing anything about the waste  
and fraud in city government,'' said Richard Bartel, a private 
investigator who said he planned to offer his services to the city 
on a pro-bono basis. 
</P>
<P>
	He and Swann were among 13 guests selected by lottery to meet  
face-to-face with the mayor. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Wright was not among them. ``I thought it was going to be  
more like showing the people what the mayor's office looked like, 
but I guess this is a good start,'' said the 43-year-old Wright, a 
resident of the Anacostia section of the city. 
</P>
<P>
	For him and the others who did not make it to the 11th-floor  
suite of offices occupied by Williams and his senior staff, there 
were options. 
</P>
<P>
	In a large room, dozens of city department heads made themselves  
available to district residents interested in talking about their 
government. 
</P>
<P>
	The police and fire chiefs sat side by side in their uniforms at  
a table in the back, while senior managers from various units of 
the Department of Public Works occupied an entire side of one room. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has some promise,'' Cardell Shelton, of the Washington  
Contractors Guild, said of the meetings. The 74-year-old lifelong 
district resident used his time with the director of public works 
to lobby for business for small independent contractors. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams plans to conduct similar events once every two weeks in  
an effort to make the government more accessible.

<HEADLINE> SEC Suspends Trading in Six Stocks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal securities regulators Friday suspended  
trading in shares of six small companies until Feb. 11. The 
unusually high number of trading halts in one day fueled 
speculation that the companies are linked. 
</P>
<P>
	In six separate announcements, the Securities and Exchange  
Commission said it took the actions because of questions about the 
accuracy of the companies' public statements. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the announcements indicated a link between two of the  
companies, Citron Inc. and Invest Holdings Group Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	At a time of wild price swings and heavy trading in Internet  
stocks, three of the companies describe themselves as being 
Internet-related. 
</P>
<P>
	The trading halts are standard 10-day suspensions, and will  
continue through 11:59 p.m. EST on Feb. 11. At that time the 
stocks, unless they're subject to a further suspension, can resume 
trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Although SEC officials did not elaborate, it is assumed an  
investigation of each company was under way. 
</P>
<P>
	Antonia Chion, assistant director of the SEC's enforcement  
division, would neither confirm nor deny a recent news report that 
the six companies were linked in a fraudulent scheme. 
</P>
<P>
	The report by MSNBC columnist Christopher Byron said the six  
companies are secretly connected and have seen their share prices 
soar, creating a combined market capitalization of $1.2 billion 
``out of nothing but hot air and empty press releases.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The six companies' shares are traded on the National Association  
of Securities Dealers' OTC Bulletin Board, an electronic trading 
system for small stocks that are thinly traded. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq Stock Market runs the Bulletin Board, but its stocks  
are not actually listed on the Nasdaq market because they don't 
meet Nasdaq listing standards or don't file disclosure statements 
with the SEC. A recent change will tighten disclosure requirements 
for companies seeking Bulletin Board listings of their stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	The six companies suspended are:

<HEADLINE>  Russians Look for Skating 3-Peat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) -- The Russians are on the verge of a  
three-peat. 
</P>
<P>
	With a victory in today's women's event, the Russian team will  
have won all the European figure skating titles three years in a 
row. 
</P>
<P>
	Ice dancing's world champions, Angelika Krylova and Oleg  
Ovsiannikov won their event Friday for make it 3-for-3 this year. A 
Russian trio stood on top of the standings in the women's event 
entering today's free skating, which concludes the competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Defending European champion Maria Butyrskaya won the short  
program with a sultry, blues program, leading teammates Viktoria 
Volchkova and Julia Soldatova, a pair of up-and-coming teen-agers 
just out of junior ranks. 
</P>
<P>
	Volchkova is making her international debut in senior  
competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Soldatova was seventh in last year's Europeans but that wasn't  
good enough to keep her on the Russian Olympic team because of the 
depth of the Russian women's field. Left off the squad this year 
was two-time European champion Irina Slutskaya. 
</P>
<P>
	Butyrskaya's success at 26 defies a trend toward younger,  
athletic skaters, like Tara Lipinski, who won the 1998 Olympic gold 
at 15. A six-time Russian national champion, Butyrskaya did not win 
an international championship until Europeans last year, following 
a coaching change. She finished fourth at the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Russian women hold their places in today's free skate,  
they'll match the men, who swept the European medals Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The pair title went to Russia on Wednesday and the ice dance  
crown stayed Russian, although Krylova and Ovsiannikov live and 
train in Newark, Del. 
</P>
<P>
	Krylova and Ovsiannikov displayed a innovative program to drums  
only that invited controversy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think champions can try something different, something  
new,'' Krylova said. ``We want to show champions can skate all 
styles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the judges were split between the Russians'  
unconventional, definitely not musical, presentation, and the 
traditional dance ``Man in the Iron Mask'' by French champions 
Marina Anissina and Gwendal Peizerat, who finished second. 
</P>
<P>
	The audience seemed to back the French, and four of the nine  
judges placed them first. 
</P>
<P>
	New scoring rules put the Russians ahead when they beat the  
French 5-4 on a head-to-head score. 
</P>
<P>
	Peizerat was upbeat despite the lose.  
</P>
<P>
	``It is important that we won the audience and that makes it  
easier for us to smile,'' Peizerat said. ``I think we are European 
champions for the audience and for us.''

<HEADLINE> Japan Pushes Consumer Spending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Massive tax cuts didn't get the Japanese buying.  
Neither have trillions of yen in public works. Now Japan is trying 
the ultimate in fiscal policy: giving money away in hopes someone 
will spend it. 
</P>
<P>
	The government handed out shopping vouchers Friday in a city in  
southwestern Japan, the first part of a plan to put $6 billion in 
shoppers' hands nationwide by the end of March. 
</P>
<P>
	The project is Japan's most direct -- and desperate -- tactic yet  
to prod its tight-fisted consumers into spending their way out of 
the country's worst recession since the end of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents in Hamada, 435 miles southwest of Tokyo, turned out in  
droves to collect the stylish coupons, paid for by the central 
government and distributed by municipalities, mostly for use in 
local shops. Kyodo News agency reported 2,500 people showed up. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1,000-yen vouchers, worth the equivalent of $8.60, are  
designed locally. One version in a city near Hamada, called a 
``Trillion Luck Ticket,'' sports cartoon characters dressed in 
festive robes and masks. 
</P>
<P>
	Elderly Japanese and those with children aged 15 or younger --  
about 35 million people -- are eligible for $170 worth of coupons. 
The vouchers are good for six months, cannot be exchanged for cash 
and shoppers cannot get change for them. However, they can spend 
them on virtually anything offered by any local shop or service 
provider, including restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the fanfare, however, the certificates have not inspired  
much hope for an economic recovery. Instead, many people feel the 
program is an act of desperation by a government bereft of any 
better ideas. 
</P>
<P>
	Toru Mantari, 37, an employee at a beer company in Tokyo, said  
he might not even bother to collect his share of coupons when they 
become available in the capital. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is just for show,'' he said, emerging from his office  
late Friday night in downtown Tokyo. ``It's such a small amount of 
money, it can't possibly help the economy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese economy could use some help.  
</P>
<P>
	The jobless rate in 1998 stood at a record-high of 4.1 percent  
and the economy shrank in fiscal 1997 for the first time in two 
decades. Bankruptcy debts hover at all-time highs. 
</P>
<P>
	At the center of the sour economic news is the pessimistic  
Japanese consumer. Economists say that a boost in domestic 
consumption would go a long way toward putting the country on the 
road to recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	That's not expected anytime soon, however. The government  
announced this week that wage-earner spending dropped 1.8 percent 
in 1998 -- the biggest decline since the oil-shock of 1974. 
</P>
<P>
	The government has already spent billions of dollars for tax  
cuts and on public works projects. More is coming: the draft 1999 
budget boosts government outlay 5.4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Economic Planning Agency announced Friday that consumer  
confidence was slightly up, but said it wasn't cause for much hope. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't say that consumer sentiment has recovered,'' said  
Takafusa Shiyoya, the agency's administrative vice minister. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Japanese were even angry about the coupon plan, saying many  
recipients were likely to spend the vouchers instead of their own 
cash, and then put more of their own money in the bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Ako Nishimura, 34, a teacher in Tokyo who is not eligible for  
the vouchers, called them ``a ridiculous waste.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It costs money just to print these things and hand them out,''  
she fumed. ``And where's that coming from? My taxes!''

<HEADLINE> Twins' Aguilera OKs Possible Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Rick Aguilera would waived the no-trade  
clause in his contract so the Minnesota Twins can keep cutting 
their payroll. 
</P>
<P>
	The reliever agreed to be traded under the right circumstances,  
even though he'd rather finish off his career in Minnesota, where 
he's the Twins' career saves leader. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rick is willing to accept a trade, not because he has any  
desire to leave Minnesota or the Twins, but because he realizes 
this is what the Twins organization and Terry Ryan need to do at 
this time,'' agent Tom Selakovich said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Aguilera has one year left on his contract and is due $3.25  
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan, the Twins' general manager, is under orders from owner  
Carl Pohlad to cut the payroll to about $11 million. It currently 
stands around $18 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Aguilera also waived a no-trade clause in 1995, accepting a deal  
that sent him from Minnesota to Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	He has 275 career saves, 12th on the career list and fifth among  
active players.

<HEADLINE> Bet on Any Aspect of Super Bowl </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Tired of the usual Super Bowl wager? Betting on  
the Denver Broncos to win a second straight title just doesn't do 
anything for you? 
</P>
<P>
	Then try this: Toss a few bucks on whether Ed McCaffrey has more  
receiving yards Sunday than Phil Mickelson has strokes in the final 
round of the Phoenix Open. 
</P>
<P>
	Or perhaps lay some dollars on the hotly debated matter of  
whether Atlanta's Terance Mathis can score more touchdowns than 
defending champion Arsenal scores goals in their Sunday showdown 
with Chelsea in the English Premier League soccer. 
</P>
<P>
	If there's a chance something might happen in the sporting world  
Sunday, there's likely a bet to be made on it in this city's legal 
sports books. 
</P>
<P>
	And there will be no shortage of bettors eager to wager on  
anything from who wins the opening coin flip to how many times both 
teams will punt. The Super Bowl is one of the biggest weekends of 
the year in this gambling city, with sports books packed from 
Friday night until the game's final seconds tick off. 
</P>
<P>
	``People love to bet these things,'' said Jackson Meeker, sports  
book supervisor at the Imperial Palace. ``Even if your team gets 
blown out by halftime, you can have a betting interest in the game 
with some well-placed proposition bets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While betting on the Super Bowl increases almost every year,  
betting on different things that might happen on the game -- or 
their relation to performances in other sports -- has been growing 
even faster. 
</P>
<P>
	So-called proposition bets now make up 20 percent of the action  
at many sports books -- an impressive number considering that most 
of them are made $10 or $20 at a time. Last year, a record $77.3 
million was bet legally on the game in Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
	``The big bettors don't bet this, but the public does,'' Meeker  
said. ``It makes things a lot more fun for the small players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Denver a 7 1/2-point favorite in most sports books going into  
the final frenzied flurry of weekend wagering, many small bettors 
who don't have a rooting interest in either team will turn to 
proposition bets to make the game a little more enjoyable. 
</P>
<P>
	They have a bewildering choice of bets to choose from, with each  
sports book giving its own unusual twists. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're not only fun for the public, but they're fun for our  
staff as well,'' said Vince Magliulo, who heads the sports book at 
Caesars Palace. ``We kind of put ourselves in the visitor's shoes 
and try to see what they would like to bet on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Caesars is offering 85 different proposition bets, from the  
player to score the first touchdown of the game (Terrell Davis is 
the 5-2 favorite) to whether Jamal Anderson will rush for more than 
93 1/2 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Bettors who think the game will start off slowly can put money  
on whether either team will score in the first 5 1/2 minutes of the 
game (no score is a 13-10 favorite). 
</P>
<P>
	``We've already had some four and five figure bets on some of  
the propositions,'' Magliulo said. ``The one thing I've found is 
that when folks wager on something, they're usually betting with 
strong convictions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the more unusual propositions are offered at the  
Imperial Palace, where players can bet across sports boundaries on 
different action. 
</P>
<P>
	If golf fans don't care for the McCaffrey-Mickelson bet, they  
can also bet even money that Jesper Parnevik's fourth round score 
in Phoenix will be higher than the number of receiving yards by 
Tony Martin. 
</P>
<P>
	There's a soccer-football matchup with the Arsenal a 2-1  
favorite to score more goals against Chelsea than Mathis has 
touchdowns against Denver. And Wichita State fans can bet on their 
basketball team scoring more points against Southwest Missouri 
State than the Falcons and Broncos do combined. 
</P>
<P>
	Even London's bookmakers are getting into the act, with odds of  
40-1 that between 91 and 100 points will be scored in the game. 
London's bookies expect to take in about $5 million in Super Bowl 
bets. 
</P>
<P>
	Bettors who don't mind keeping their money in play for a while  
can also bet at Caesars Palace the chances of both Denver and the 
New York Yankees repeating in 1999 as champions of their respective 
sports. 
</P>
<P>
	The odds are 4-1 against that happening.  
</P>
<P>
	``Denver is obviously the favorite in the Super Bowl and the  
Yankees will be the early favorite to win the World Series again,'' 
Magliulo said. ``You're in action right up until October if the 
Broncos win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the proposition bets offered on the Super Bowl at the  
Imperial Palace sports book in Las Vegas (Bets that are plus money 
are underdog bets. Minus figures are favorites. For example, a +170

<HEADLINE> Chilean Olympic Leader Suspended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) -- Sergio Santander, expelled from the IOC  
in the Salt Lake City bribery case, has been suspended as president 
of the Chilean Olympic Committee as a result of the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee's board directors suspended Santander Thursday  
night. Committee vice president Luis Moreno, who temporarily took 
over the top position, said Friday that the panel's 42 sports 
federations will make a final decision on Santander Feb. 8. 
</P>
<P>
	Santander has denied any wrongdoing. He told a news conference  
earlier this week that he received no money from the Salt Lake City 
bid or organizing committees. 
</P>
<P>
	He admitted, however, receiving a contribution to his  
unsuccessful 1993 race for congress from Tom Welch, the former 
president of the Salt Lake committee. Santander said that money, 
``an absolutely modest amount,'' was a personal donation from Welch 
and his wife, not from the Salt Lake City committee.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Seeks Drug Prevention Money </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House drug policy office plans to  
ask Congress for more money this year to boost its drug prevention 
and treatment efforts, even as some Republicans say they would like 
more focus on eradicating illegal narcotics at their source. 
</P>
<P>
	Methadone treatment of heroin addiction, drug courts and prison  
testing are some of the areas that could receive a boost in the 
Clinton administration's budget proposal, which will be outlined 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Office of National Drug Control Policy received $17 billion  
for the current fiscal year, up from $13.2 billion in 1995, and 
expects to request more for next year, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	``For many years, the prevention side was downplayed,'' said  
James McDonough, chief strategist at the drug policy office. 
``That's where we're going to have to grow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the last four years, the administration has already expanded  
its budget for drug prevention by 40 percent, and for drug 
addiction treatment by 17 percent. The office says such measures 
have shown results: this December it reported that teen drug use 
was stabilizing after years on the rise, although it's still much 
higher than in the early 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of drug-related murders also continues to drop.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think we've made some progress in the past year,'' says Rep.  
Rob Portman, R-Ohio. He pointed to a $1 billion, five-year 
advertising campaign launched last year that targets young adults 
as an example of drug prevention efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	But some members of Congress say they'll be looking for more  
concrete evidence the ads are a worthwhile investment. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's one area we are going to carefully look at,'' says Rep.  
John Mica, R-Fla., who heads the Committee on Government Reform's 
panel on criminal justice, drug policy and human resources. Mica 
also said he hopes to re-start some drug eradication and 
interdiction programs cut in the mid-1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	At Republican urging, Congress authorized $690 million in  
emergency spending this summer for illegal drug interdiction, money 
that has helped to pay for more coast guard and military personnel 
to fight drug smuggling. 
</P>
<P>
	There has been a sharp drop in coca farming in the two countries  
that traditionally supply most of the drug crop -- Peru and Bolivia. 
But that success has been offset by increases in Colombia, the drug 
office says. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, that will allow the administration to focus on one  
country, rather than three, in curbing supply, says McDonough. The 
administration also says it would like to see more agents 
patrolling the Southwest border. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Silvestre Reyes, D-Texas, would also like to see improved  
technology for halting drug traffickers, particularly at border 
crossings. But Reyes, a former border patrol chief, says simply 
halting the supply is not enough: He also supports such initiatives 
as drug courts, which allow those convicted of nonviolent crimes to 
go into rehabilitation instead of prison. 
</P>
<P>
	The drug office also will try to gain support in Congress for  
treatment programs, including those using methadone.

<HEADLINE> Michael Jackson Jr. Is Sick </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Michael Jackson's 2-year-old son was treated  
for flu-like symptoms after being rushed to a hospital by ambulance 
with his father at his side, a family attorney said.

<HEADLINE>  Rapper Master P Tries Out for NBA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT MILL, S.C. (AP) -- Millionaire rapper Percy Miller says he's  
got game. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Shaq (Lakers star Shaquille O'Neal) can play basketball and  
rap, I can rap and play basketball,'' says Miller, an NBA wannabe 
who is more famous as rap artist Master P. 
</P>
<P>
	While not everyone in the Charlotte Hornets camp agrees with  
him, no one is questioning his heart or his drive. But can a 
28-year-old street ball player with a net worth of $56 million make 
the long leap from the Continental Basketball Association to the 
NBA? 
</P>
<P>
	``Just say it's a long, long, long shot,'' said Charlotte  
general manager Bob Bass as the time drew closer to the Hornets' 
first preseason game tonight against the Atlanta Hawks. 
</P>
<P>
	Point guard David Wesley didn't want to make any predictions on  
Miller's chances of making the club. He was added to the Hornets' 
training camp roster last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's an icon around here,'' Wesley said with a smile, glancing  
over at Miller, who was being interviewed by a local TV reporter 
following the Hornets' practice Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller shrugs off all the skepticism with a smile featuring a  
mouth full of gold teeth with diamond inlays. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't be here if I wasn't hungry,'' he said after a  
two-hour workout with better-known Hornet players like Wesley, 
center Derrick Coleman and power forward Anthony Mason. ``I'm ready 
to show the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the court, Miller has shown he can play with the best. He was  
a big hit when he made his first appearance with the Hornets in a 
free scrimmage at the Charlotte Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
	His popularity helped draw more than 15,000 fans. With some of  
his fans showing up at 7 a.m., the Hornets were forced to open the 
gates 30 minutes early. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller got a loud ovation when he was introduced. When his  
3-pointer swished through the net, the fans cheered as if it came 
in the final seconds of the NBA Finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller, a guard, finished with nine points on 3-of-6 shooting  
and handed out four assists to offset his one turnover. 
</P>
<P>
	A sign in the stands read: ``Goodbye MJ, Hello Master P.''  
</P>
<P>
	To that, he replied: ``Michael Jordan always had the fans'  
attention. Why can't Master P get the fans' attention now?'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Miller picked up most of his basketball skills from street  
ball, he also played at Warren Easton High School in New Orleans 
and briefly at the University of Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	Until recently, he was with the CBA's Fort Wayne Fury. He was  
invited to the Hornets camp after Tyree Davis, father of Hornets 
rookie Ricky Davis, talked to Bass and the coaches. 
</P>
<P>
	While his chances of making the team are slim at best, he can  
teach his other teammates a thing or two about winning in the 
business world. 
</P>
<P>
	He started his own record company, No Limit, and has turned it  
into a multifaceted, music-production sports agency business, 
grossing $56 million in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	As an agent, he represents Ricky Davis and NBA players Ron  
Mercer and Derek Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the fact that Saturday's scrimmage was the first time  
Coleman had appeared in public as a member of the Hornets, Miller 
had the largest crowd of autograph seekers surrounding him after 
the workout. 
</P>
<P>
	``He can play,'' said Hornets coach Dave Cowens. ``It's always  
good when someone gets the fans to pay attention.''

<HEADLINE> 'Mighty Mo' Re-Enters Public Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PEARL HARBOR, Hawaii (AP) -- She served with honor in World War  
II, the Korean War and the Gulf War, but had succumbed to old age. 
</P>
<P>
	The teakwood decks where Japan surrendered in 1945 had cracked.  
The battleship gray paint had faded. Grass grew topside. 
</P>
<P>
	But Friday, some of the 17,000 sailors to serve on the ``Mighty  
Mo'' were piped aboard a spruced-up battleship during its 
dedication as a memorial to the end of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	The ship becomes the newest member of Pearl Harbor's Battleship  
Row. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is indescribable pride among the men who served aboard  
this ship,'' said Herb Fahr, of Plainview, N.Y., president of the 
USS Missouri BB-63 Association, which consists of former crewmen. 
``We know our ship will be here for the next millennium.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was exactly 55 years ago Friday that the ``Mighty Mo'' was  
launched by Harry S. Truman's daughter. It was on the decks of the 
Missouri that Japan's foreign minister surrendered to Gen. Douglas 
MacArthur on Sept. 2, 1945. 
</P>
<P>
	``She has always stood for freedom and an ambassador of good  
will,'' said retired Navy Capt. Lee Kaiss, the last commander of 
the ``Mighty Mo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 887-foot, 45,000-ton battleship is docked next to the USS  
Arizona, sunk during the Pearl Harbor attack that triggered U.S. 
entry into World War II. The ships are bookends signifying the 
beginning and end of America's involvement in that war. 
</P>
<P>
	About 3,000 people attended the invitation-only dockside  
ceremony at Ford Island. 
</P>
<P>
	Many visitors headed for the section where Japan Foreign  
Minister Mamoru Shigemitsu signed the Instrument of Surrender in 
Tokyo Bay on Sept. 2, 1945 at 9:04 a.m. A plaque marks the site 
where MacArthur accepted it. 
</P>
<P>
	The ship arrived in Pearl Harbor in June after being towed from  
Bremerton, Wash., where it had been mothballed for years. 
</P>
<P>
	The refurbishing of the ship's topside and some interior areas  
has been completed, and work will continue on other below-deck 
areas, said retired Adm. Robert Kihune, president of the Battleship 
Missouri Memorial Association. 
</P>
<P>
	``A rusty, dirty ship has been turned into a proud battleship,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The ship has had a high profile ever since it was christened on  
Jan. 29, 1944, with a bottle of champagne made from Missouri 
grapes. 
</P>
<P>
	The battleship joined the Third Fleet in the Pacific and fought  
at Iwo Jima, Okinawa and Kyushu. 
</P>
<P>
	It first was decommissioned in 1955 but then recommissioned in  
1986 for a round-the-world cruise. During that latter ceremony, 
Margaret Truman Daniel urged the ship's crew to ``take care of my 
baby,'' Kaiss said. 
</P>
<P>
	The ship returned to battle briefly in January 1991 in the  
Persian Gulf to join Operation Desert Storm, firing Tomahawk 
missiles and hundreds of 16-inch shells at Iraqi positions before 
leaving two months later. 
</P>
<P>
	It was again decommissioned in 1992.

<HEADLINE> Cher Will `Rock' National Anthem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Cher insists her attire when she performs the  
national anthem at the Super Bowl will be plain. Her rendition 
won't be, though. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a little rock-and-roll,'' the Oscar-winning entertainer  
said Friday as she prepared to rehearse. ``It rocks, it really 
does. I never realized that before. And the lyrics are great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cher will join the high-energy rock band KISS in a powerful  
pregame show that will include more than 600 other performers, 
along with pyrotechnics and other special effects. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we'll be trying to do on Super Bowl Sunday is to try and  
bring down low-flying aircraft,'' band member Ace Frehley said. 
``That's our goal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cher joins a stellar list of Super Bowl anthem performers that  
includes Diana Ross, Barry Manilow, Billy Joel, Whitney Houston, 
Garth Brooks and Harry Connick Jr. Houston's version, performed in 
1991 at the height of the Gulf War, is considered one of the 
all-time classics. 
</P>
<P>
	Cher, whose jet-black hair was streaked with fuchsia at Friday's  
news conference, wouldn't guarantee her version would rank up with 
Houston's. But she promised her own style with the song, considered 
one of the toughest to master vocally. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to do my version of the national anthem,'' she said.  
``If they wanted a straight version, they could have gotten a 
hundred of people to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like other recent performers, Cher prerecorded the anthem with  
an 80-piece orchestra. She hasn't decided yet whether to sing it 
live on Sunday or lip-sync it. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're leaving it up to me,'' she said. ``But they said  
there's something about airplanes and stadium noise, so they needed 
to get the main track down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She also remains undecided about what to wear, but reiterated  
her previous statement that it won't be her usual style of 
revealing -- and sometimes outrageous -- outfits. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just going to wear something really plain,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	That won't be the case with KISS. Known for its heavy makeup,  
black studded costumes and stage antics, the group has sold more 
than 80 million records, and their recent reunion tour was the 
highest-grossing tour of 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``We love doing what we do, anytime we get on stage,'' Frehley  
said. ``We're not hams, we're the whole pig.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This year's Super Bowl also will feature a postgame show,  
headlined by KC and the Sunshine Band, which is celebrating its 
25th anniversary this year. 
</P>
<P>
	It's also a homecoming for band leader H.W. Casey, who was born  
in Hialeah, Fla., and grew up in Miami Lakes. He is one of three 
original members still with the group. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope it's not a blowout because then it'll be really  
boring,'' Casey said. ``That's the big thing.''

<HEADLINE> Son Killed When Used As `Shield' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- A crack addict who police say used his  
children as ``shields'' when he bought drugs in dangerous 
neighborhoods was charged with murder Friday after his 6-year-old 
son was fatally shot during a deal gone bad. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities say an argument over $20 worth of drugs led to the  
Jan. 4 shooting of Michael Kile's son William, who was shot in the 
back of the head when a bullet pierced a window of his father's 
car. The boy died at a hospital eight days later. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said Kile, 37, used his children as human shields,  
assuming their presence would protect him from violence. 
</P>
<P>
	``He definitely used his son as he was dying as almost a shield,  
too,'' Detective Thomas Sarfaty said. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we have here is a tragedy of one guy who is willing to  
kill over $20, and another person so addicted to crack cocaine that 
he put his own son in harm's way,'' Prosecutor Scott Newman said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to murder, Kile was charged with two counts of child  
neglect and supplying false information to police. He remained at 
large Friday. If convicted, he faces up to 89 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	The alleged gunman, Donnell L. Hughley, 21, was arrested Monday.  
He was charged Friday with murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Newman said witnesses have told police Kile is a crack cocaine  
addict who frequented a high-traffic drug area just north of 
downtown. He was such a common fixture that dealers gave him the 
street name ``White Mike.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the morning of Jan. 4, Kile went to the area and bought crack  
cocaine, Newman said. He had about $100 in his pocket at the 
beginning of the day, but ran out of money. 
</P>
<P>
	Kile left the area, then showed up later that afternoon with a  
new power drill. With him were his sons, William and 12-year-old 
Michael, who has Down syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
	Kile then allegedly drove to the street where he met up with  
Hughley. 
</P>
<P>
	A witness told police he saw a struggle in which Kile, seated in  
his car as Hughley stood outside, tried to take the dealer's drugs. 
Kile drove off, and Hughley was dragged for several yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Hughley got up and fired shots toward Kile's car, Newman said.  
</P>
<P>
	After the shooting, Kile had told police he was driving with his  
boys in another part of town, looking for a puppy. He said he heard 
a gunshot and saw his son was hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	``A man has got to be a slave to crack cocaine (to do this),''  
Sarfaty said.

<HEADLINE> Mickey Rooney Is Back on Stage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Mickey Rooney is back on stage as the man behind  
the curtain, the guy in charge of handing out brains, hearts and a 
bit of c-c-courage. 
</P>
<P>
	Rooney said he gets a charge out of his role as the wizard in a  
touring company of ``The Wizard of Oz,'' a musical that opened 
Thursday at the Wang Center. 
</P>
<P>
	The 78-year-old showman of stage and screen doesn't plan to slow  
down anytime soon. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love what I'm doing. I guess that energizes when you love  
what you're doing. Age is nothing but experience and some of us are 
more experienced than others,'' Rooney said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rooney, who starred on Broadway in a 1980s revival of ``A Funny  
Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum,'' has dozens of film 
credits including ``National Velvet'' (1944) and ``The Black 
Stallion,'' which earned him a nomination for an Academy Award in 
1980. 
</P>
<P>
	The musical will run through Feb. 7.

<HEADLINE> Researchers Study New Mexico, Mars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARLSBAD, N.M. (AP) -- Deep in the subterranean reaches of the  
Spider Cave, there is little to sustain life. No sunlight, little 
water and few nutrients make this one of the most hostile 
environments in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet somehow, scientists have found microscopic creatures  
dwelling in the eternal darkness. By probing the nooks and crannies 
of the Spider Cave, they hope to answer a question for the ages: Is 
there life on Mars? 
</P>
<P>
	NASA planetary scientists are eager to review the findings.  
</P>
<P>
	``The work is very relevant to Mars because we know the surface  
of Mars is as dead as a doornail and any life there -- if it exists 
-- would live underground,'' said Chris McKay, a planetary scientist 
at NASA's Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Spider Cave, in Carlsbad Caverns National Park, feels as if it  
might be on another planet. Dripping stalactites protrude from the 
cave's ceiling, reaching out like great tentacles. And gaping pits 
-- like giant moon craters -- are scattered haphazardly across the 
cave floor. The silence is as deep as the darkness. 
</P>
<P>
	The cave got its name from the thousands of daddy longlegs that  
once inhabited its entrance. 
</P>
<P>
	Caves are isolated ecosystems low in organic nutrients. But the  
microbes in the Spider Cave can survive without sunlight and thrive 
on the basic elements -- such as iron, manganese and sulfur -- found 
in the cave walls. Researchers have found similar microbes living 
in other remote places -- polar caps, ocean bottoms and mountain 
tops. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists think life might be able support itself on a planet  
like Mars by feeding on underground chemicals, similar to the way 
bacteria in the Spider Cave survive, said Penelope Boston, part of 
a team of University of New Mexico researchers who have been 
studying the cave for four years. 
</P>
<P>
	Wearing elbow and knee pads and toting hard hats with  
spotlights, scientists trek to the Spider Cave's research site by 
hiking down a mile-long, winding trail and over rugged terrain into 
a canyon. That's the easy part. 
</P>
<P>
	They then descend 10 feet to the first narrow opening and worm  
through a tight, 50-foot passage, no more than 3 feet wide and 2 
feet high in some places. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like being born again,'' quips geology student Justin  
Pearce. 
</P>
<P>
	After the first belly crawl, the cave opens into an intricate  
web of passages that run up to four miles in every direction. A 
marked trail keeps cavers from getting lost inside the bewildering 
maze. 
</P>
<P>
	The search for microscopic organisms may not have the appeal of  
the search for intelligent life, but NASA's McKay said it's just as 
important. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you look at our own planet Earth, for half of its history,  
life was microscopic,'' McKay said. ``It's the first step to more 
complicated life.''

<HEADLINE> Tuggle Overwhelmed by Super Bowl </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Remembering some of his former teammates, Jessie  
Tuggle can't help but wonder why it took him a dozen years to reach 
his first Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's been a lot of great guys here,'' the Atlanta Falcons  
linebacker said. ``Brett Favre, Deion Sanders, Andre Rison, Michael 
Haynes, the list goes on and on. 
</P>
<P>
	``This could have been a team ... to reckon with for a long  
period of time if, somehow, we'd kept all the talent that came 
through his organization.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe it's a sense of history that makes Tuggle so passionate  
about Sunday's game against the Denver Broncos. Every word harbors 
a torrent of emotions -- excitement and urgency, redemption and 
desperation, responsibility and honor. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuggle makes it clear this Super Bowl is not just for him, and  
it's not just for his teammates. It's for the old-timers who 
maintained a sense of dignity in the face of defeat. It's for an 
entire city that endured three decades of miserable NFL football. 
</P>
<P>
	``This week is so much bigger than me,'' he said. ``This is  
about all the former players that played here in Atlanta ... like 
Mike Kenn and Jeff Van Note and Joel Williams and Buddy Curry, the 
guys who never had the opportunity to experience what I'm 
experiencing throughout their time in Atlanta.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's not all.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is for the city of Atlanta -- they've been waiting for  
this for so long. This is for the Smith family (who own the team) 
and the whole organization. This is large. This is something we've 
all dreamed about and talked about and this is something that we 
really want.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There's a fury in his eyes, but no chance he'll burn himself out  
before the game. Not after all the losses, all the ridicule, all 
the agony of the past 11 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll tell you what, our confidence is sky high right now,'' he  
said. ``We truly feel when we hit the football field that we can't 
be beat. And it takes that type of confidence -- it's not a 
cockiness, it's a confidence you feel -- and even when adversity 
strikes, and you're behind in the fourth quarter, you don't give 
up, you fight to the end.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That sort of attitude mirrors Tuggle's career. His name always  
seems to surface when a teammate discusses the satisfaction of 
Atlanta's first Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	A gentle, family-oriented man away from the field, Tuggle  
transforms himself on Sundays. He's the relic of a bygone era when 
rugged, angry men like Dick Butkus and Jack Lambert patrolled the 
middle linebacker position. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no doubt that Jessie has a special place in my  
heart,'' said defensive end Chuck Smith, who's been with the 
Falcons since 1992. ``He's the one guy here who always laid it on 
the line, and I knew I wanted to do that in my career. He still 
works as hard as anybody on the team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 33-year-old Tuggle takes the practice field with rookie-like  
vigor, as if he's fighting for a job every day. He still seems to 
view himself as that undersized linebacker from tiny Valdosta State 
University, the guy who wasn't even drafted in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	Twelve years later, he's proven the critics wrong. But he can't  
distance himself from those who never thought he'd make it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never take the easy way out,'' the 5-foot-11, 230-pounder  
said. ``Why take the easy way out? Just getting into this league 
was a challenge to me. I came in as the short free agent nobody 
wanted. That mentality stuck with me the whole time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want anyone to give me anything. I want to go out and  
take it. That's how it's been for me as far as wanting to be part 
of the solution for the Atlanta Falcons. It wasn't an easy fight. 
In fact, it's been an uphill fight for me. But I hung in there and 
good things started to happen.''

<HEADLINE> Jury Recommends Death for Capano </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) -- A wealthy, politically connected lawyer  
convicted of killing his mistress sat emotionless as a jury called 
for his execution, only hours after he asked to live for the sake 
of his family. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas Capano's daughters wept silently as the jury's  
recommendation was read Thursday. Later, as he was being led from 
the courtroom, he mouthed to his 76-year-old mother, Marguerite, 
``It'll be all right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Superior Court Judge William Swain Lee said the recommendation  
will carry great weight in his sentencing decision. No sentencing 
date has been set. 
</P>
<P>
	Capano, 49, was convicted Jan. 17 of murder by the same jury  
that condemned him to die for the 1996 killing of Anne Marie Fahey. 
The case has riveted the state. 
</P>
<P>
	Capano admitted at the start of his three-month trial that he  
stuffed the body of Ms. Fahey, who was Gov. Thomas Carper's 
scheduling secretary, into a cooler and dumped it into the sea. 
Capano maintained, though, that another mistress accidentally shot 
Ms. Fahey in a jealous rage. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense lawyer Jack O'Donnell suggested Capano suffers from  
mental problems and asked that his life be spared. 
</P>
<P>
	But prosecutor Colm Connolly denounced Capano as ``a black hole  
of evilness,'' telling jurors at trial that Capano thought he could 
get away with murder because of his political and legal 
connections. 
</P>
<P>
	Capano's trial divided his family. His brothers Gerard and  
Louis, who helped him dispose of evidence, testified against him, 
while his brother Joseph testified on his behalf. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors -- who had no body or murder weapon -- contended that  
Capano killed Ms. Fahey, 30, because she wanted to end their secret 
affair. 
</P>
<P>
	For 2 1/2 years, Capano -- a one-time state prosecutor and political  
adviser whose family operates a construction business -- said he 
didn't know what happened to Ms. Fahey after they dined at a posh 
Philadelphia restaurant on June 27, 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	In an explosive twist during the trial, he claimed another  
mistress, Deborah MacIntyre, shot Ms. Fahey. Ms. MacIntyre denied 
even being at Capano's house that night. 
</P>
<P>
	An unrepentant Capano stuck by his story Thursday, telling  
jurors ``the hardest thing I've had to deal with has been the 
disloyalty of friends'' who testified against him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to sit here and beg for my life,'' Capano added.  
``I do ask you to consider my daughters, my mother and the rest of 
my family. For their sake, I do ask you to let me live.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Capano's defense team promised to mount appeals but didn't  
discuss them. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're crushed. What can we say? We thought we'd saved his  
life. We didn't,'' said chief defense lawyer Joseph Oteri.

<HEADLINE> Remember Those Tax-Law Changes / On the Money  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Did you know ...  
</P>
<P>
	You only have to hold property for a year to become eligible for  
the lowest capital gains tax? There are tax credits to ease the 
expense of college tuition? Married taxpayers have some recourse 
against their (tax) cheating spouses? 
</P>
<P>
	If you didn't, perhaps it's time to hone up on some changes in  
the tax law, especially if you're among the many die-hard taxpayers 
determined to prepare your own returns in the coming weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Several provisions of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 went into  
effect last year, including ones pertaining to capital gains, 
tuition credits and innocent spouses. Also enacted: The Internal 
Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998, which became 
law on July 22, and the Tax and Trade Relief Extension Act of 1998, 
on the books Oct. 21. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the more notable changes in tax year 1998 involved  
Individual Retirement Accounts and the additional savings options 
now available. 
</P>
<P>
	The Roth IRA was one. In this new account, those meeting certain  
income requirements (a phase-out begins for individuals grossing 
$95,000 a year and married couples at $150,000) can make 
nondeductible contributions in which the earned income is 
tax-exempt upon withdrawal. That's part of what makes it so 
attractive. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, you don't have to wait until retirement to access the  
account. You may, for example, use some of the money for a new home 
or for college expenses in some instances. The same holds true for 
traditional IRA holders, another change in the tax law. 
</P>
<P>
	You have until April 15 to open an IRA for tax year '98. While  
you can still convert a traditional IRA to a Roth, it's too late to 
take advantage of a one-time tax break that allows the income tax 
owed on the conversion to be spread out over four years. That 
deadline came and went on Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	The Education IRA also was introduced last year as a means to  
help middle-income families meet rising college costs. Up to $500 
can be contributed tax-free per child for educational expenses each 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Here are highlights of some of the other significant changes in  
the tax code, which may affect tax preparers this year: 
</P>
<P>
	-- Capital gains. Congress shortened the capital gains holding  
period, which enables taxpayers to receive the lowest capital gains 
tax rate, from 18 months to 12 months. That means sellers of 
stocks, bonds and real estate need only hold the property for a 
year to be eligible for the low 20 percent rate, or 10 percent if 
you're in the 15 percent tax bracket, after a sale is made and a 
gain realized. 
</P>
<P>
	A note for homeowners: You may now escape taxes on some of the  
gains on a home sale even if you don't meet the two-year ownership 
rule. The government uses a special formula for prorating gains, 
but says the sale must be due to job relocation, illness or some 
unforeseen circumstance. (You can completely exclude up to $250,000 
of gain, or $500,000 if you're married filing jointly, on the sale 
of a home, but you must own and occupy it at least two years before 
the sale.) 
</P>
<P>
	--Innocent spouse relief. Married folks filing joint returns are  
each liable for taxes owed and assessments arising from an audit. 
However, several provisions were added to the tax code to provide 
relief for spouses who can establish they didn't know taxes weren't 
being paid and for situations among the divorced and separated in 
which an additional tax is clearly the other spouse's 
responsibility. If you're divorced, legally separated, or have 
lived apart from a spouse for at least a year, you may elect 
innocent spouse relief up to two years after the IRS initiates a 
collection action. 
</P>
<P>
	--Child tax credit. You can now claim an annual tax credit of  
$400 per dependent child under age 17; in tax year '99 it rises to 
$500 per child. The credit phases out, however, for single parents 
with adjusted gross income starting of $75,000 and married couples 
earning $110,000. 
</P>
<P>
	--Education tax credits. The Hope scholarship credit was  
established to also help defray higher education expenses, like 
qualified tuition. A maximum $1,500 credit can be taken per year 
for the first two years of college. For the second two, there's the 
Lifetime Learning credit, up to $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
	A deduction for student loan interest also can be taken. For tax  
year 1998, it begins at $1,000, and reaches $2,500 by 2001.

<HEADLINE> Priest Apologizes for Blaming Blacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WARREN, Ohio (AP) -- A priest apologized to the black community  
for trying to cover up his suicide attempt by claiming two black 
men attacked him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to make amends,'' the Rev. Thomas Spisak told about 25  
city and church leaders at Progressive Baptist Church, a 
predominantly black church. 
</P>
<P>
	Spisak, 55, first told police that he had been attacked by  
intruders June 13 at his church residence. He later admitted he had 
stabbed himself 88 times and lied about the attackers. 
</P>
<P>
	Bishop Thomas J. Tobin of Youngstown said Spisak had been  
depressed over heart surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Spisak also thanked the Youngstown Roman Catholic  
Diocese and Tobin for their support. He returned to Warren earlier 
this month after spending six months at a therapy center in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thank people for their prayers and understanding,'' said  
Spisak, who's scheduled for a February trial in Trumbull County 
Common Pleas Court. He is charged with falsification and faces up 
to six months in jail and a $1,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
	James Pugh, president of the Trumbull County NAACP, said after  
the speech that he appreciated Spisak's apology and felt no 
animosity toward him. 
</P>
<P>
	Tobin has said Spisak's future as a priest depends on his  
recovery.

<HEADLINE>  Inflation Fears in Brazil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- With inflation threatening a return  
performance, housewife Dora Inui isn't taking any chances. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of the one bag of beans she used to purchase in her  
weekly trips to a large Sao Paulo supermarket, she decides to throw 
six into the shopping cart ``before prices go up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ghost of inflation, long the scourge of Latin America's  
largest economy, is once again haunting Brazilians. 
</P>
<P>
	And the retail sector, led by supermarkets, has emerged as the  
exorcist, promising to drive away suppliers who want to raise their 
prices. Instead, retailers are pressing suppliers to prove higher 
prices are justified and demanding that any increased costs be 
negotiated. 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks ago, Brazil abruptly devalued its currency, the real,  
spelling the end of a 1994 economic stabilization program that 
successfully brought inflation down from nearly 3,000 percent a 
year to about 2 percent in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The real has since fallen by about 40 percent and  
pre-devaluation estimates that placed inflation at close to zero by 
the end of 1999 have now been revised to at least 10 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Although store prices still remain relatively stable, largely  
due to supplies purchased before the devaluation, retailers have 
moved quickly to prevent the return of the bad old days when price 
stickers were changed almost daily. 
</P>
<P>
	Back then, when monthly double-digit inflation figures were the  
rule, consumers would rush to supermarkets on payday and stock up 
on enough goods to last them a month. 
</P>
<P>
	``It used to be terrible,'' said Custodia Maria Rocha Oliveira,  
a proofreader at a publishing house. ``Our purchasing power would 
start withering away almost as soon as we received our wages.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Suppliers of a wide range of products, including flour, poultry,  
coffee, plastics and household appliances have used the devaluation 
to justify planned price hikes. 
</P>
<P>
	Many claim that as the buying power of the real sinks on world  
markets, pushing up prices for imported raw materials and 
components, they have been forced to increase consumer prices by as 
much as 30 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogerio Amato, a director of Eletros, an association of electric  
appliance manufacturers, said price increases in his sector were 
unavoidable because imported components account for 50 percent of 
production costs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are going to have to raise our prices,'' he said. 'There's  
no other way out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The devaluation, which makes it easier for Brazilian goods to  
compete on the basis of price in other countries, has also 
encouraged exports, something that could hurt Brazilian consumers. 
For example, coffee, poultry and orange juice producers are 
earmarking large parts of their production for the export market. 
</P>
<P>
	``This could result in shortages, which spells higher prices for  
the Brazilian consumer,'' said Pierre Brisset, research director of 
the French-owned Carrefour supermarket chain, Brazil's largest. 
</P>
<P>
	``The devaluation will inevitably lead to higher prices,'' he  
added. ``But many suppliers have presented us with new prices which 
are simply abusive, unacceptable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By abusive, he said he meant any ``double-digit increase.''  
</P>
<P>
	``Suppliers who increase their prices by more than 10 percent  
will have to justify themselves and show us their spreadsheets,'' 
Brisset said. ``If not, we will look for alternatives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pao de Acucar, Brazil's second-largest supermarket chain, has  
adopted the same stance. 
</P>
<P>
	``The retail sector has to be like a dike that is used to  
carefully control how much water can pass,'' said Pao de Acucar's 
commercial director Valdemar Machado. ``We will only buy from 
suppliers who negotiate and propose reasonable price increases.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Brazilian consumer, who enjoyed price stability during the  
Real Plan, will also help keep the lid on inflation, Brisset said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Consumers will no longer passively accept exorbitant price  
hikes,'' he said. ``They are more willing to do without certain 
items and brand loyalty has been replaced by price loyalty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Conceicao Aparecida dos Santos, a secretary in a law firm,  
agrees. 
</P>
<P>
	``Prices continue the same,'' she said as she reaches for a  
package of her favorite spaghetti. ``But if they go up I'll look 
for another cheaper brand. I have to worry about my pocketbook, not 
their's.''

<HEADLINE>  IOC Widens Salt Lake, Sydney Inquiry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- More IOC members have been targeted in the  
Olympics' biggest corruption scandal, which now covers Sydney as 
well as Salt Lake, the committee's chief investigator said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC vice president Dick Pound said an ``indefinite number'' of  
names from the 106 committee members have been added to the inquiry 
since its initial report on the Salt Lake City case was released 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound refused to identify the recent additions to an  
investigation that already has led to the expulsion or resignation 
of nine members, the biggest purge in the IOC's 105 years. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said fresh information from the ethics commission  
investigating Salt Lake's successful bid for the 2002 Winter Games, 
and news involving Sydney's winning bid for the 2000 Summer Games, 
led to the latest steps. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are looking at some of the other members and not just based  
on information coming out of the Salt Lake City investigation,'' 
Pound said. ``It's an indefinite number and an indefinite line to 
follow. We will go where the trail leads us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Pound commission found that 14 IOC members, including one  
who has since died, took almost $800,000 in cash, travel and 
medical expenses, lavish gifts and services from the Salt Lake bid 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides the resignations and expulsions announced Sunday, the  
IOC said three members remained under investigation and a fourth 
member was warned. 
</P>
<P>
	As Pound's group was finishing its ``first sweep'' of Salt Lake,  
word came that the head of the Australian Olympic Committee 
promised $70,000 to two African IOC members the night before Sydney 
won the 2000 Games by two votes over Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
	One of those members, Charles Mukora of Kenya, also was  
implicated in the Salt Lake case and has resigned. The other member 
was identified as Francis Nyangweso of Uganda. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound said it was ``safe to assume'' his commission was now  
looking at member involvement with the Sydney bid. 
</P>
<P>
	He also expects to look at the failed 1996 bid of Toronto, where  
officials said Thursday they spent more than $500,000 to cover the 
cost of IOC members breaking or stretching rules. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would imagine that they would now come forward with names  
and details,'' Pound said. 
</P>
<P>
	And he said the IOC investigation of Salt Lake remained open,  
based on a full review of reports from the independent Utah ethics 
panel. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound said he had no information on Austin Sealey, an IOC member  
from Barbados who was identified in Friday's Washington Post as a 
possible recipient of money from Salt Lake that was not evident in 
initial reviews. 
</P>
<P>
	The Salt Lake Tribune, meanwhile, said investigators had  
subpoenaed University of Utah records of Bold Magvan, a son of IOC 
member Shagdarjav Magvan of Mongolia. 
</P>
<P>
	In Paris, Jean-Claude Ganga of the Republic of Congo said he had  
40 members who would vote to reinstate him to the IOC at a special 
assembly in March. Pound said such a reversal probably would force 
the ruling executive board, of which he is a member, to resign. 
</P>
<P>
	``That would be a serious point of non-confidence,'' Pound said.  
He said he would be ``very surprised'' if the expulsions were 
overturned. 
</P>
<P>
	When he announced the expulsions, IOC president Juan Antonio  
Samaranch said all bid cities from the 1996 Games onward would be 
asked to identify members who acted improperly in the bidding. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound said those letters were to be mailed from IOC headquarters  
in Lausanne, Switzerland, on Friday, with a Feb. 16 deadline to 
reply, about two weeks later than originally intended but still in 
time for the investigations to be finished by the special session 
March 17-18. 
</P>
<P>
	And in another of the six investigations of Olympic bidding  
around the world, the U.S. Olympic Committee said the report of its 
special inquiry on Salt Lake, led by former Senate Majority Leader 
George Mitchell, would be released March 1. 
</P>
<P>
	In other developments:  
</P>
<P>
	--USA Today said Ganga and former Salt Lake Olympics chief Tom  
Welch shared a bank account. Welch's lawyer, Tom Schaffer, said 
Welch's name was on the account so he could get funds for Ganga if 
Ganga was out of the country. Welch, the lawyer added, never made a 
deposit or withdrawal from the account. 
</P>
<P>
	--Ganga told the French newspaper Liberation that Samaranch was  
sacrificing friends in the scandal to try to clear his own name. 
</P>
<P>
	--Samaranch resigned as president of La Caixa, Spain's  
fourth-largest bank. The 78-year-old IOC president said he was 
leaving because of his age, not the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	--Sergio Santander, expelled from the IOC in the Salt Lake case,  
was suspended as president of the Chilean Olympic Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	--Two proprietors of a defunct Salt Lake escort service told the  
Tribune their escorts entertained IOC members at hotels during 
visits in 1995. They did not say who paid for the escorts. 
</P>
<P>
	--A Browning rifle given to Samaranch by Salt Lake organizers is  
worth much more than the $671 listed, KTVX in Salt Lake reported. 
Leon Burrows, who designed the gun's engraving, told the TV station 
the gun could sell for up to $25,000. 
</P>
<P>
	--The Olympics' top TV organizer, Manolo Romero, reportedly was  
paid $1.5 million for his services during the 1992 Barcelona Games. 
Spanish sports authorities defended Barcelona's finances against 
the report in the newspaper El Mundo.

<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- It will be a rockin' pregame show.  
</P>
<P>
	Cher will join the high-energy rock band KISS in the pregame  
show that will include more than 600 other performers, along with 
pyrotechnics and other special effects. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we'll be trying to do on Super Bowl Sunday is to try and  
bring down low-flying aircraft,'' band member Ace Frehley said. 
``That's our goal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like other recent performers, Cher prerecorded the national  
anthem with an 80-piece orchestra. She hasn't decided yet whether 
to sing it live on Sunday or lip-sync it. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're leaving it up to me,'' she said. ``But they said  
there's something about airplanes and stadium noise, so they needed 
to get the main track down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cher promised her own style with the anthem, considered one of  
the toughest to master vocally. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a little rock-and-roll,'' the Oscar-winning entertainer  
said Friday as she prepared to rehearse. ``It rocks, it really 
does. I never realized that before. And the lyrics are great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But they will be sung differently that what's been heard before.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to do my version,'' she said. ``If they wanted a  
straight version, they could have gotten a hundred of people to do 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This year's Super Bowl also will feature a postgame show,  
headlined by KC and the Sunshine Band, which is celebrating its 
25th anniversary this year.

	SALES RECORD:@ Denver stars John Elway and Terrell Davis are  
among 12 members of the NFL Quarterback Club featured in a new line 
of collectible beanie bear toys called ``Bammers.'' The line set a 
QVC NFL non-apparel sales record earlier this month when close to 
$300,000 worth sold in a one-hour time slot. 
</P>
<P>
	Each collectible beanie ``Bammers'' bear features a player's  
name, number, team colors and logos.

	COIN TOSS:@ Members of the 1958 Baltimore Colts and New York  
Giants, who participated in what many consider ``The Greatest Game 
Ever Played,'' will participate in the coin toss before Sunday's 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall of Famers Raymond Berry, Lenny Moore, Art Donovan and Gino  
Marchetti plan to represent the Colts, who beat the Giants 23-17 in 
overtime in the 1958 championship game. 
</P>
<P>
	Frank Gifford, Roosevelt Brown, Sam Huff, Tom Landry, Don  
Maynard and Andy Robustelli will represent New York. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	QB ADVANTAGE:@ Chris Chandler doesn't buy the argument that  
Atlanta has the advantage at quarterback because he had a better 
season statistically than Denver's John Elway. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's something I don't think anybody can really say and back  
up,'' Chandler said. ``John Elway is similar to Michael Jordan in 
that, regardless of how he may be playing, he could take over, turn 
it on and probably win the game for you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While there's no comparison between their career numbers,  
Chandler compiled a 100.9 quarterback rating while completing 58 
percent of his passes for 3,154 yards, 25 touchdowns and 12 
interceptions this season. Elway had a 93 rating and completed 59 
percent of his attempts for 2,806 yards, 22 TDs and 10 
interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some people feel I may have the edge, but very few people  
really know the game well. I know I've been playing quite well, and 
I'm very confident in what I can do,'' Chandler said. ``But you're 
going a little bit too far when you say that anybody is better than 
John Elway.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	SNAPPY DRESSER:@ Since joining the Falcons, Reeves has abandoned  
his routine of wearing a coat and tie on game day. Part of the 
reason, he said, is it took too much effort to figure out what was 
to wear each game. Another factor was he felt he might be able to 
help sagging sales of Falcons merchandise by wearing more casual 
clothing featuring the team's logo. 
</P>
<P>
	``It had become difficult for me to dress ... I figured it was a  
good time to change,'' Reeves said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't helping me control my temper, which is the reason I  
wore a coat and tie. I thought it would calm me down some, and I 
was getting just as mad in a coat and tie as I was in the other. It 
was just a lot of reasons, and I'm glad I did it.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *FALCONS CORNERBACKS:* Atlanta cornerback Ronnie Bradford, who  
suffered a separated shoulder in the final regular season game, 
will return to the Falcons' starting lineup for the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	But expect Michael Booker to get plenty of playing time, too.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think Ronnie Bradford will start,'' Reeves said. ``He is  
back at full speed. Michael will play an awful lot, but we will 
start Ronnie Bradford.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradford started 10 games during the regular season, while  
Booker started six times when Bradford was hampered by a knee 
injury.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Tripp Lawyer Sought for Query </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ELLICOTT CITY, Md. (AP) -- State prosecutors asked a judge to  
force one of Linda Tripp's former lawyers to answer questions about 
tapes his ex-client made of conversations with Monica Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	James Moody, Mrs. Tripp's former attorney, said the request was  
``totally outrageous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I will oppose the motion on the grounds of privilege,'' he  
said. ``A prosecutor can't turn a lawyer into a tool to get his 
client. Otherwise, nobody would ever share secrets and confidences 
with their lawyers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moody said prosecutor Stephen Montanarelli filed the motion this  
week. A Howard County judge is scheduled to hear arguments on Feb. 
25. 
</P>
<P>
	Moody invoked attorney-client privilege and his Fifth Amendment  
rights in refusing to answer questions about the tapes' existence 
and whereabouts, and whether he had played them for anyone when he 
was subpoenaed to appear before a Howard County grand jury on Dec. 
10. 
</P>
<P>
	The grand jury is investigating whether Mrs. Tripp broke  
Maryland's wiretap law, which makes it illegal to audiotape a 
conversation without another person's consent. 
</P>
<P>
	Montanarelli declined Friday to discuss his plans for the case,  
but said, ``We are not going to be doing anything in the immediate 
future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The maximum penalty is five years in prison and a $10,000 fine,  
but ignorance of the law is a valid defense. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton's impeachment trial, stemming from his  
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, is continuing in the Senate.

<HEADLINE> Boston's Walker Next Scoring Champ? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WALTHAM, Mass. (AP) -- No Boston Celtics player has ever won an  
NBA scoring title. In fact, no one but Michael Jordan has won it in 
the last 10 seasons he played. 
</P>
<P>
	Can Antoine Walker break the Celtics drought and supplant Jordan  
as the league's scoring king? 
</P>
<P>
	``I hate to prejudge my statistics right now,'' Walker says.  
``If the opportunity is there for me to score, I think I can score 
with the best of them. But I think my job this year and from now on 
with the Celtics is to fit in wherever I can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But with Jordan retired, leading in scoring isn't out of the  
question. Walker jumped from 31st in the league as a rookie all the 
way to the fifth spot last season. And that was with rather poor 
shooting accuracy -- 42.3 percent from the field and 64 percent from 
the free throw line. 
</P>
<P>
	This season, the Celtics added a shooting coach, Andy Enfield.  
</P>
<P>
	``I want to get better at free throws if I plan on having the  
ball late in the game when you get fouled,'' Walker said. ``That's 
not something that I'm overly concerned about because I know I'm 
capable of doing that with a little concentration, a little work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But will he improve enough to lead the NBA in scoring?  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know,'' he said. ``It's hard to say because you never  
know what your role's going to be on this team. We've got a lot of 
guys who can score.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last season, the 6-foot-9 Walker averaged 22.4 points and led  
the team in scoring 55 times. Rookie Ron Mercer was second, leading 
14 times. 
</P>
<P>
	But Mercer should improve on his 15.3-point average, and rookie  
Paul Pierce provides added offensive punch. Point guard Kenny 
Anderson, limited by injury to 16 games last season with Boston 
after being traded by Toronto, is adept at distributing the ball to 
the open man. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's trying to get everyone involved,'' guard Dana Barros said  
of Anderson. ``I think if Antoine was on a team that didn't have as 
much scoring and wasn't playing the type of style that we were, 
maybe he could lead the league. But I don't think he will now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Jordan's departure leaves the scoring race wide open. In  
addition to Jordan, only Shaquille O'Neal, Karl Malone and Mitch 
Richmond outscored Walker last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has that capability'' to be the top scorer, Celtics general  
manager Chris Wallace said. ``I think we would prefer to have an 
Antoine Walker that's ranked very high in a number of statistical 
categories ... and we're winning. We're more concerned about that 
than leading the league in scoring.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walker tied for seventh in the NBA last season with 10.2  
rebounds per game. For the Celtics, he was first in steals and 
second in assists and blocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Pierce, the rookie from Kansas, already is impressed.  
</P>
<P>
	``He can lead this league in almost every offensive category,''  
Pierce said. ``He's that good a talent.''

<HEADLINE> Public May See Microsoft Case Tapes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal appeals court today agreed to make  
public the full three days of videotaped interviews of Microsoft 
Chairman Bill Gates being questioned by government lawyers in the 
company's antitrust case. 
</P>
<P>
	During more than 13 weeks of trial, government lawyers have  
shown roughly eight hours of the interviews. Today's ruling means 
the rest of the video -- about 12 hours' worth -- will be made 
public. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling also makes public dozens of depositions with other  
Microsoft executives and with leaders of other high-tech companies. 
There was no indication when any of the interviews will be made 
public. 
</P>
<P>
	The order requires that reporters and the public be allowed to  
attend any future depositions, said Jay Brown, a lawyer whose firm 
argued the case on behalf of several media organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	The government asked the judge yesterday to allow it to question  
Microsoft's next witness, James Allchin, again before he takes the 
stand Monday, but the judge denied the request. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia  
affirmed an earlier decision by the trial judge, who reluctantly 
agreed last August that the deposition of Gates was open to the 
public under an obscure 1913 law. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft had quickly asked the appeals court to prevent  
reporters and the public from actually attending the three days of 
interviews with Gates at the company's headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	The court agreed but left open the question until today whether  
the public would get to see the entire deposition on videotape. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are constrained to enforce the statute by its terms and to  
apply it to the depositions taken in this case,'' Circuit Judge 
Douglas Ginsburg wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	The interviews proved highly embarrassing to Microsoft because  
Gates often professed to forget key events and appeared to evade 
questions he believed overly broad. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the trial, when Microsoft complained about showing  
the video in the courtroom, the trial judge admonished the 
company's lawyer that, ``If anything, I think the problem is with 
your witness, not with the way in which his testimony is being 
presented.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's evident to every spectator that, for whatever  
reasons, in many respects Mr. Gates has not been particularly 
responsive,'' U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gates himself bristled at use of the videotape in a telephone  
interview in November with The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	``I answered every question, completely, truthfully through  
many, many, many long days,'' Gates said. ``The fact that they're 
taking snippets out of that and holding them up without having me 
there because they chose not to call me as a witness, I think, is 
quite novel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft had argued that opening the deposition to the public  
would lead to a ``carnival atmosphere'' and a ``media circus.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The judge said he was bound by an 85-year-old federal law that  
covers depositions in antitrust lawsuits. The rarely used law says 
such depositions ``shall be open to the public as freely as are 
trials in open court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft lost another ruling Thursday at its trial, when the  
judge ordered the company to surrender an e-mail that threatens to 
undermine one of the company's legal arguments in its antitrust 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
	The internal e-mail from a software engineer in October 1998  
explains in unprecedented detail some of the ways Microsoft 
combined its Internet browser software into its dominant Windows 
operating system. 
</P>
<P>
	The government charges the combination amounts to illegal  
``tying'' under federal antitrust law. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft's unease about the e-mail was evident. In part, the  
company claimed the note was covered under attorney privilege 
because one of its lawyers was included in the e-mail's ``cc'' 
(carbon copy) field. 
</P>
<P>
	``They recognized the harmful character of the document,''  
Justice Department lawyer David Boies said outside court. 
</P>
<P>
	But Bill Neukom, the company's lead in-house lawyer, told  
reporters: ``We didn't have anything to hide.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The government said the e-mail supports claims that Microsoft  
easily can identify which parts of shared computer code relate to 
Windows and which parts relate to its browser, a necessary 
distinction if it were ordered to separate the products. 
</P>
<P>
	The government alleges that Microsoft's decision to bundle its  
browser within Windows is ``tying,'' illegal under antitrust law 
because it requires consumers who buy one product also to buy 
another.

<HEADLINE> Baptist Trial Explores Phony List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LARGO, Fla. (AP) -- A company that paid $1 million to market life  
insurance to the National Baptist Convention USA's black members 
ended up sending letters to non-Baptists, including a Ku Klux Klan 
grand dragon, an executive testified Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was the quickest and most negative response that I have  
ever received in my 27 years of direct marketing,'' George Burke, 
vice president of marketing for Globe Accident and Life Insurance 
Co., said in the racketeering trial of the Rev. Henry Lyons, 
convention president. 
</P>
<P>
	The KKK leader sent the package back marked in red ink.  
</P>
<P>
	``He did not appreciate receiving this mailing,'' Burke said.  
</P>
<P>
	Lyons and Bernice Edwards, his alleged mistress, are charged  
with racketeering. They are accused of faking membership figures to 
swindle more than $4 million from companies to buy fancy cars, 
expensive jewelry and classy homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorneys say Lyons merely made bad business deals and  
is being blamed for failing to raise enough money for his church 
group. 
</P>
<P>
	Globe, a direct mail company based in Oklahoma City, paid a  
total of $1 million based on Lyons' claim that the group had 8.5 
million members, former Globe marketing official Robert Richey 
testified. Globe was given two phony mailing lists of church 
members before Lyons admitted there was no such list, Richey said, 
calling the deal ``a disaster.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Globe paid $400,000 for the first list. It later gave $600,000  
to the convention, believing it was earmarked for a struggling 
university, with the hope of gaining an exclusive right to a 
mailing list, Richey said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons also is charged with grand theft, accused of stealing  
$250,000 the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith donated to 
rebuild burned black churches in the South. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons faces another trial this spring on federal charges.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Aide Created Phony Church List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LARGO, Fla. (AP) -- A former aide to the Rev. Henry Lyons told  
jurors she had an affair with him, helped him create a phony 
mailing list and eventually quit her job because she could not 
tolerate his ``un-Christian behavior.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons, president of the National Baptist Convention USA, stared  
straight ahead Thursday as he listened to the testimony of Bonita 
Henderson in his trial on racketeering and other charges. 
</P>
<P>
	To his left sat Bernice Edwards, another alleged mistress of  
Lyons. Both are accused of swindling more than $4 million to buy 
diamond jewelry, expensive homes and luxury cars. 
</P>
<P>
	In the courtroom gallery was Lyons' wife, Deborah. It was the  
fires she set at an expensive waterfront home her husband owned 
with Ms. Edwards that spurred a lengthy investigation into the 
minister's finances, leading to the charges against him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told him I could no longer tolerate his erratic,  
unprofessional, anti-Christian behavior,'' Henderson told jurors of 
the day in 1995 she handed in her resignation. 
</P>
<P>
	The resignation came, she said, shortly after she created a  
phony mailing list of 8.5 million convention members from a $90 set 
of phone discs from a computer store. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Henderson said she used the directory -- containing names,  
addresses and telephone numbers of people throughout the country -- 
to make 150 floppy disks for Lyons to sell to a life insurance 
company that thought it was getting the convention's mailing list. 
</P>
<P>
	The convention has claimed 8.5 million black members and an  
affiliation of 33,000 churches.

	At the time, there were only 12,000 to 15,000 members on the

Ms. Henderson testified.

	Prosecutors have said the 8.5 million figure was ``a total

money intended for business deals which they instead used to buy 
luxury items.

	Ms. Henderson, a computer specialist, was Lyons' administrative  
assistant and paramour from 1990 to 1995 while he was president of 
the Florida General Baptist Convention and after his 1994 election 
to the national post. 
</P>
<P>
	Their relationship began falling apart after Ms. Edwards came  
into the picture in 1993, she said. Ms. Edwards, a convicted 
embezzler from Milwaukee who was on probation, told people she and 
Lyons were going to marry ``as soon as he got rid of his drunk 
wife,'' Ms. Henderson testified. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the racketeering charge, Lyons is charged with  
grand theft, accused of stealing $250,000 from the Anti-Defamation 
League of B'nai B'rith intended to rebuild burned black churches in 
the South. 
</P>

	Lyons faces another trial this spring on 54 federal charges of  
bank fraud, wire fraud, extortion and money laundering.

<HEADLINE> Major Airlines Raise Fares </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Several major airlines raised fares by up to 4  
percent on Friday in what could signal the first across-the-board 
hike in 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
	Delta Air Lines was the first to raise prices on business  
tickets by 2 percent and leisure tickets by 4 percent, a move that 
was quickly matched by Northwest Airlines, Continental Airlines, 
American Airlines and America West Airlines. Other leading airlines 
were studying the moves and the prospect that the fare increases 
would spread throughout the industry sent airline stocks soaring. 
</P>
<P>
	Northwest's participation in the fare hike was significant  
because its reluctance to raise fares had thwarted attempts last 
year to implement increases. Its shares rose almost 18 percent on 
the news. 
</P>
<P>
	Last September, an attempt by airlines to raise prices was  
rescinded in 36 hours because Northwest, facing the threat of a 
pilots' strike, rolled back the increase. 
</P>
<P>
	Northwest reached an agreement with pilots and has a tentative  
agreement with machinists, but is currently in negotiations with 
its flight attendants. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it will stick,'' said Tom Parsons, editor of  
Bestfares.com, a magazine and Web site that specializes in 
low-price air fares. 
</P>
<P>
	It is harder for an airline to raise fares during contract  
negotiations because it gives the perception that they are flush 
with cash and should bring more to the table 
</P>
<P>
	``Usually, they raise fares several times a year, but it's been  
18 months since the last hike,'' Parsons said. ``This may be round 
one of many more to come.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ironically, United announced on Friday it had launched a  
domestic and international fare sale for travel before May 27. 
Tickets must be purchased by Feb. 12 and standard restrictions 
apply. 
</P>
<P>
	Incentives to lure fliers during the slow travel time of late  
winter and early spring are common, however. A United spokesman 
said the airline was reviewing the fare increases by competitors 
and could not comment further. 
</P>
<P>
	On the New York Stock Exchange, United's parent UAL Corp. was up  
$3.87 1/2 at $62.25 a share; AMR Corp., the parent of American, gained 
$4.25 to $58.75, and Delta was up $4.43 3/4 at $54.56 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	In trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market, Northwest gained $4.12 1/2  
to close at $27.37 1/2.

<HEADLINE> Cod Regulations Affect Fisherman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- It just became a lot more difficult for fishermen  
to make a living in New England. 
</P>
<P>
	Faced with saving fish or fishermen, the New England Fishery  
Management Council on Thursday did what they thought would help 
both: They passed tough controls that slashed the daily cod catch 
in half and closed a swath of sea that stretches 180 miles, from 
Maine to Cape Cod Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is going to have a huge trickle-down effect from the fish  
to the fisherman to the fish buyer,'' said Craig Mavrikis, a cod 
fisherman from New Hampshire. ``It's not going to be good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, the day after the regulations were approved, people  
in the fish industry braced for the fallout. 
</P>
<P>
	Fishermen said they were looking for other jobs. Fish brokers  
said they were looking to Canada, Iceland and the Pacific to fill 
cod orders. And commercial buyers shrugged, saying the effects 
would be felt mainly by the consumer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Little by little they're taking away all of our options,''  
said Frank Patania, a 39-year-old manager at Ideal Seafood Inc. in 
Boston. ``We'll still get the cod from places like Canada or 
Iceland. But that means higher prices.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The restricted fishing area will be divided into four sections  
to be closed one at a time on a rolling basis in May, June, October 
and November. 
</P>
<P>
	The restrictions, which could start as soon as May, would also  
ban all gear capable of catching groundfish, fish that live near 
the bottom of the ocean. The controls still need approval from the 
U.S. Commerce Department. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past, restrictions have been imposed to rebuild stocks in  
the Gulf of Maine. But after scientists in December released a 
report that the cod population was at its lowest in 30 years in the 
Gulf of Maine, the council determined that the cod catch should be 
cut by 80 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know this will seriously impact small boat fishermen,''  
said Chris Kellogg, a council officer. ``But unless there was a 
substantial reduction in fishing levels, the cod stocks would have 
continued to drop.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The restrictions could prompt regional economic losses ranging  
from $19.9 million to $21.8 million, according to an estimate in a 
draft analysis completed this week. 
</P>
<P>
	As many as 2,500 fishermen could be out of work and 700 boats  
could be grounded, according to another estimate from Sen. Edward 
Kennedy, D-Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	Mavrikis, the cod fisherman, said: ``It's time to start looking  
for another job.''

<HEADLINE> New Artificial Bladder Works in Dogs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Artificial bladders grown in a laboratory worked  
well for nearly a year in dogs, raising hopes for a similar 
treatment for humans with serious bladder disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Human bladders can be ravaged by cancer, birth defects, nerve  
damage or trauma. They can be repaired or replaced with intestinal 
or stomach tissue, but that can lead to infection and bladder 
stones. 
</P>
<P>
	In the February issue of the journal Nature Biotechnology, Dr.  
Anthony Atala and colleagues report promise for a different 
stategy. They took small bits of bladder tissue from six dogs and 
grew the cells into artificial bladders in the lab. Then they put 
the artificial organs back into the animals, whose own bladders had 
been removed. 
</P>
<P>
	The artificial organs worked normally for the 11 months of the  
study. 
</P>
<P>
	While scientists have studied artificial bladders before, ``this  
is the best one I've ever seen,'' commented Dr. Eli A. Friedman, 
editor of the journal of the American Society for Artificial 
Internal Organs. 
</P>
<P>
	The work must be confirmed by other groups, but Atala's results  
provide strong evidence that the technique works, said Friedman, a 
professor of medicine at the State University of New York at 
Brooklyn. 
</P>
<P>
	Atala, a urologic surgeon at Children's Hospital and Harvard  
Medical School in Boston, said more research is needed before the 
technique could be tried in people. 
</P>
<P>
	To grow the bladders, researchers separated two kinds of cells  
from the bladder tissue samples, and grew each kind out into a 
sheet. They attached one sheet to the inside of a mold and the 
other sheet to the outside. This assembly was transplanted into 
whichever dog provided the initial tissue. 
</P>
<P>
	The mold disintegrated within three months, replaced by normal  
tissue.

<HEADLINE> Study: No Hanford Link to Disease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHLAND, Wash. (AP) -- Cold War-era radiation releases from the  
Hanford nuclear reservation are not linked to the incidence of 
thyroid disease among people who lived downwind from the plant, a 
10-year federal study concluded. 
</P>
<P>
	Results of the Hanford Thyroid Disease Study were released  
Thursday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
</P>
<P>
	``The study, to put it in a simple statement, found no increased  
risk for thyroid disease from exposure to radioactive iodine 
released from the Hanford facility,'' said Dr. Paul Garbe, a CDC 
adviser on the $18 million study. 
</P>
<P>
	``We also recognize there will be people who don't believe the  
results of this study,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hanford, built in 1943 as part of the secret World War II  
Manhattan Project, produced plutonium for the U.S. nuclear arsenal 
into the 1980s. The 560-square-mile Department of Energy site is 
considered the nation's most contaminated nuclear site. 
</P>
<P>
	Many in the Northwest for years have blamed Hanford for a  
variety of illnesses, particularly cancer. Researchers have found 
that some downwinders were likely to have ingested radioactive 
iodine from Hanford releases. 
</P>
<P>
	The CDC study examined the thyroid health of 3,441 people born  
between 1940 and 1946 looking for a link between radioactive iodine 
releases from Hanford between 1944 and 1957 and the rate of thyroid 
disease among those living downwind. 
</P>
<P>
	Participants were randomly selected from the four counties  
closest to Hanford, in southeastern Washington, as well as from 
three counties in northeastern Washington where low exposure would 
be expected. 
</P>
<P>
	The thyroid -- a butterfly-shaped gland in the neck -- influences  
metabolism and aids the growth and development of nearly every 
tissue in the body. 
</P>
<P>
	Like others in the study, Sally Sanders was a child when Hanford  
released substantial amounts of radiation into the air in the '40s 
and '50s. All three of her siblings were diagnosed with thyroid 
cancer. One sister, Linda, died in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	During a public meeting at which researchers explained their  
findings, she held up a handmade sign that said: ``I don't believe 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Scott Davis, the principal investigator from Seattle's Fred  
Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, which conducted the study for 
the CDC, called the findings powerful. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a high level of confidence in these results,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kay Sutherland, who suffers from an underactive thyroid,  
believes Hanford releases have caused or worsened health problems 
for many people in the region. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they found a link between Hanford and the thyroid disease,  
then they would have to find a link with all the other diseases in 
this area,'' said Sutherland, 58, of Walla Walla, about 50 miles 
southeast of here. 
</P>
<P>
	Garbe said studies like this one cannot tell whether every  
individual's thyroid disease is or isn't caused by Hanford 
radiation. 
</P>
<P>
	``It can only tell us that in this specific group of people we  
did not find a link between the thyroid disease and their estimated 
thyroid radiation dose from Hanford,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Defendant Weds Witness, Ends Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPRINGFIELD, Mass. (AP) -- A man charged with vehicular homicide  
married the only witness against him just before his trial, 
effectively ending the case. 
</P>
<P>
	A judge dismissed charges Jan. 22 against Michael Vega after his  
bride, Antoinette Marie Joseph, refused to testify. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Constance Sweeney called the timing of the marriage ``a  
terrible violation of ordinary moral decency.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last June, Vega, 30, was riding with Joseph, 32, and arguing  
with her when he allegedly grabbed the wheel. The car swerved into 
the path of an oncoming vehicle and struck an oncoming car, killing 
the driver, John Askins, 64, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense lawyer Colin Keefe said the case was dismissed because  
there was no evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	Sweeney said she couldn't take any action against the couple  
because state law allows spouses to refuse to testify against each 
other. That didn't restrain her from telling the newlyweds: ``I 
hope you are able to sleep at night.''

<HEADLINE> Greyhounds Getting Sick in South </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- The worst epidemic of kennel cough  
in recent memory is choking the greyhound racing industry in the 
Southeast, costing millions of dollars and killing at least seven 
dogs. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of dogs in Florida and Alabama have been diagnosed  
with the disease, which is similar to whooping cough in humans. The 
strain is particularly strong and has survived the efforts of 
veterinarians seeking to control it with antibiotics. 
</P>
<P>
	All of Florida's 12 greyhound racing facilities have imposed  
quarantines or lockdowns to prevent dogs from coming in or going 
out of their facilities, and many have had to cut back on their 
daily racing, if not cancel it completely. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have closed for weather reasons but never for this type of  
thing,'' said Theresa Hume, spokeswoman for the Palm Beach Kennel 
Club, which will celebrate its 68th birthday next month. 
</P>
<P>
	The Palm Beach facility called off live racing through Monday as  
260 of its 900 dogs were sick. The facility still was offering 
simulcast racing and poker. The matinee also was canceled Friday at 
the Naples-Fort Myers track, where about 300 of the track's 1,000 
dogs have come down with the hacking cough. 
</P>
<P>
	Racing resumed Friday in Daytona Beach, where at least one dog's  
death Tuesday was blamed on the common, highly contagious illness. 
And racing also was back at Derby Lane in St. Petersburg, where the 
deaths of six dogs were being examined by veterinarians. Some of 
the dogs showed signs of a viral infection that caused them to run 
high fevers and essentially bleed to death. 
</P>
<P>
	Though it has lost some customers in recent years to the lottery  
and other wagering, dog racing still means big money. In fiscal 
year 1997-98, Florida took in $43,821,000 in revenue from live 
racing and simulcast wagering, according to state records. 
</P>
<P>
	Derby Park estimated it lost about $850,000 during its two-week  
shutdown, while the track in Sarasota estimated a $400,000 loss of 
revenues due to a nine-day shutdown. Palm Beach said it had not 
calculated the losses yet, but each day of racing generates about 
$300,000 in revenue, most of which goes back to bettors, Hume said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. William Dugger, veterinarian at the Palm Beach club since  
1968, said he's never seen such a widespread epidemic. The 
illnesses of the dogs in Florida and Alabama have caused tracks all 
over the country to impose quarantines or refuse dogs from those 
two states. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida requires all dogs to be vaccinated once a year for  
kennel cough, distemper and rabies, Dugger said. But this strain 
seems unaffected by the vaccine. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've always had (common kennel cough). But never like this,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Greyhound Protection League has called for a moratorium on  
all racing until all the dogs are healthy. 
</P>
<P>
	``This goes beyond kennel cough,'' said spokeswoman Susan  
Netboy. ``The stress of racing the dogs when they are potentially 
ill is what makes this otherwise benign kennel cough a killer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Track officials around the state refuted those claims.  
</P>
<P>
	``I work very hard to present a good product to our customers,''  
said Dugger, the veterinarian, who says he researches ways to help 
cure greyhound illnesses. ``I love these dogs. They have done very 
well by me, and I'm going to try to leave them something when I'm 
gone.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Seeks Trade Authority </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton is trying a new tack to win  
labor leaders' support for legislation that would give him a freer 
hand in negotiating trade agreements: He is paying special 
attention to their worries about the rights of workers abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	But labor is determined to fight him again on so-called  
``fast-track'' negotiating authority unless the legislation 
specifies that recognition of workers' rights must be spelled out 
in the heart of trade agreements. 
</P>
<P>
	Such authority would allow the president to negotiate trade  
deals that the Senate would have to accept or reject without 
amendment. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the president or the majority in Congress want to try a  
third time with fast-track as it's previously been tried, we'll 
beat it again,'' said David Smith, the AFL-CIO's director of public 
policy. ``I think they have come to that conclusion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton wants to increase trade as a hedge against the financial  
turmoil that rocked Asia and Latin America. He insists that 
fast-track negotiating power is essential to carry out his plans to 
organize a new round of global trade talks and to bring Chile into 
the North American Free Trade Agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Fast-track authority, in turn, is jeopardized by labor's  
opposition, which can cost Clinton Democratic support in the 
Senate. So Clinton has been touting workers' rights in major 
speeches and pushing the issue up the agendas of such forums as the 
World Trade Organization and the International Labor Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials say Clinton is trying to change the  
dialogue around trade. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that if we are able to begin to see these objectives  
as mutually reinforcing, and not mutually exclusive, that it will 
further the chance for a different, bipartisan consensus on 
fast-track,'' said Labor Secretary Alexis Herman. 
</P>
<P>
	American labor leaders insist they do not necessarily want to  
export U.S. labor standards. But they want trade agreements to 
require partners at least to enforce workers' safety, health and 
compensation laws already on their books. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration has been exploring new approaches to the fast  
track with Democrats on Capitol Hill and informally with labor 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no question that what not only the president but what  
others have been saying over the last nine or 10 months has taken 
more account of the kinds of concerns that we've been raising,'' 
AFL-CIO's Smith said. ``We're encouraged by that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Herman said the administration recognizes ``that we have to do  
more in this area. The question is how do we put those partnerships 
together?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Any move to require worker protections in labor agreements is  
likely to meet resistance from Republicans and business, normally 
Clinton's allies in the fight for expedited negotiating authority. 
</P>
<P>
	Early in Clinton's first term, the NAFTA fight exposed a rift  
between labor and the administration. The trade pact that Clinton 
largely inherited from Republican President Bush's administration, 
then pushed as his own, relegated protections for workers and the 
environment to unenforceable side agreements. 
</P>
<P>
	Partly as a result, unions were apathetic in the 1994 elections,  
in which Republicans took over Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	When Clinton sought renewal of fast-track authority in 1997,  
there seemed little likelihood Republicans would support requiring 
worker protections in trade deals. 
</P>
<P>
	This month, in a radio address from the United Auto Workers'  
headquarters in Detroit, Clinton argued for expanded trade with the 
assertion that the nation's continued economic vitality ``depends 
upon the world's prosperity.'' But trade alone, he said, will not 
guarantee success. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of all, we must ensure that the new global economy works  
for working people,'' he said. ``Working families around the world 
must be able to exercise core labor rights, benefit from legal 
standards for fair pay and reasonable hours and safe working 
conditions and improve their lives through unions, just as 
generations of Americans have done through the UAW.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president hit that point again in his State of the Union  
address, saying that for too long trade has divided Americans.

<HEADLINE>  Rapper Master P Tries Out for NBA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT MILL, S.C. (AP) -- Millionaire rapper Percy Miller says he's  
got game. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Shaq (Lakers star Shaquille O'Neal) can play basketball and  
rap, I can rap and play basketball,'' says Miller, an NBA wannabe 
who is more famous as rap artist Master P. 
</P>
<P>
	While not everyone in the Charlotte Hornets camp agrees with  
him, no one is questioning his heart or his drive. But can a 
28-year-old street ball player with a net worth of $56 million make 
the long leap from the Continental Basketball Association to the 
NBA? 
</P>
<P>
	``Just say it's a long, long, long shot,'' said Charlotte  
general manager Bob Bass as the time drew closer to the Hornets' 
first preseason game tonight against the Atlanta Hawks. 
</P>
<P>
	Point guard David Wesley didn't want to make any predictions on  
Miller's chances of making the club. He was added to the Hornets' 
training camp roster last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's an icon around here,'' Wesley said with a smile, glancing  
over at Miller, who was being interviewed by a local TV reporter 
following the Hornets' practice Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller shrugs off all the skepticism with a smile featuring a  
mouth full of gold teeth with diamond inlays. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't be here if I wasn't hungry,'' he said after a  
two-hour workout with better-known Hornet players like Wesley, 
center Derrick Coleman and power forward Anthony Mason. ``I'm ready 
to show the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the court, Miller has shown he can play with the best. He was  
a big hit when he made his first appearance with the Hornets in a 
free scrimmage at the Charlotte Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
	His popularity helped draw more than 15,000 fans. With some of  
his fans showing up at 7 a.m., the Hornets were forced to open the 
gates 30 minutes early. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller got a loud ovation when he was introduced. When his  
3-pointer swished through the net, the fans cheered as if it came 
in the final seconds of the NBA Finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller, a guard, finished with nine points on 3-of-6 shooting  
and handed out four assists to offset his one turnover. 
</P>
<P>
	A sign in the stands read: ``Goodbye MJ, Hello Master P.''  
</P>
<P>
	To that, he replied: ``Michael Jordan always had the fans'

<HEADLINE>  Rapper Master P Tries Out for NBA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT MILL, S.C. (AP) -- Millionaire rapper Percy Miller says he's  
got game. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Shaq (Lakers star Shaquille O'Neal) can play basketball and  
rap, I can rap and play basketball,'' says Miller, an NBA wannabe 
who is more famous as rap artist Master P. 
</P>
<P>
	While not everyone in the Charlotte Hornets camp agrees with  
him, no one is questioning his heart or his drive. But can a 
28-year-old street ball player with a net worth of $56 million make 
the long leap from the Continental Basketball Association to the 
NBA? 
</P>
<P>
	``Just say it's a long, long, long shot,'' said Charlotte  
general manager Bob Bass as the time drew closer to the Hornets' 
first preseason game tonight against the Atlanta Hawks. 
</P>
<P>
	Point guard David Wesley didn't want to make any predictions on  
Miller's chances of making the club. He was added to the Hornets' 
training camp roster last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's an icon around here,'' Wesley said with a smile, glancing  
over at Miller, who was being interviewed by a local TV reporter 
following the Hornets' practice Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller shrugs off all the skepticism with a smile featuring a  
mouth full of gold teeth with diamond inlays. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't be here if I wasn't hungry,'' he said after a  
two-hour workout with better-known Hornet players like Wesley, 
center Derrick Coleman and power forward Anthony Mason. ``I'm ready 
to show the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the court, Miller has shown he can play with the best. He was  
a big hit when he made his first appearance with the Hornets in a 
free scrimmage at the Charlotte Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
	His popularity helped draw more than 15,000 fans. With some of  
his fans showing up at 7 a.m., the Hornets were forced to open the 
gates 30 minutes early. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller got a loud ovation when he was introduced. When his  
3-pointer swished through the net, the fans cheered as if it came 
in the final seconds of the NBA Finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller, a guard, finished with nine points on 3-of-6 shooting  
and handed out four assists to offset his one turnover.

<HEADLINE> Failed Suicide Blows Up Building </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- A man whose bungled suicide attempt blew apart  
a portion of an apartment complex was ordered to stand trial on two 
felony counts stemming from the explosion. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael McGilbra apparently tried to kill himself by opening a  
gas valve and inhaling the fumes. He fell asleep, and when he woke 
up lit a cigarette with the intent to blow himself up, Special 
Agent Daniel Heenan from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and 
Firearms testified at a hearing Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The resulting blast tore the roof off a building, destroyed or  
damaged several units, and knocked McGilbra unconscious. 
</P>
<P>
	He was hospitalized in a burn unit for several days after the  
Jan. 4 explosion for treatment of second-degree facial burns. 
Damage was estimated at $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Three children were cut by flying glass, but there were no major  
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	McGilbra, 40, was ordered to stand trial after Thursday's  
hearing. He sat in court in shackles and peering through thick 
glasses. He declined to take the witness stand. 
</P>
<P>
	A Feb. 11 arraignment date was set on felony charges of  
endangering property by explosives and malicious injury to private 
property.

<HEADLINE> Batch of Diphtheria Vaccine Recalled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- One batch of a vaccine called Tripedia, which  
immunizes children against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis, was 
recalled today because it is too weak to fully protect against 
diphtheria. 
</P>
<P>
	The tetanus and pertussis, or whooping cough, portions of the  
vaccine are strong enough, the Food and Drug Administration said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the subpotent diphtheria portion means there may be some  
children who need an additional shot -- those traveling to 
diphtheria-prone countries, the FDA said. 
</P>
<P>
	How many children received the subpotent vaccine is unclear  
because manufacturer Pasteur Merieux Connaught refused to say how 
many doses were sold and where, calling the information 
proprietary. 
</P>
<P>
	Pasteur is writing every doctor who purchased a recalled dose,  
so that doctors can decide whether any of their patients need to be 
alerted. 
</P>
<P>
	The recalled Tripedia doses bear the lot number 0916490, and  
were sold nationally between February and June 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Diphtheria is a serious, sometimes fatal, infection, but  
widespread vaccination has made it very rare in developed 
countries. There are only a handful of U.S. cases each year, so the 
risk to children who received the weak vaccine is extremely low, 
the FDA said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, diphtheria causes serious outbreaks abroad,  
particularly in Russia and other parts of the former Soviet Union. 
Parents should contact a doctor before traveling abroad with a 
child affected by the recall, the FDA said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, children who received the weak vaccine should get their  
next regularly scheduled diphtheria vaccine on time, the FDA said. 
Children require a total of five diphtheria immunizations: At 2, 4 
and 6 months of age, at 12-18 months, and between ages 4 and 6 
years.

<HEADLINE> Knievel Doing Well After Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Daredevil stuntman Evel Knievel is on the  
mend and could be back on his motorcycle in six weeks, his doctor 
said Friday two days after performing a liver transplant. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no signs of rejecting the long-awaited organ and  
Knievel, 60, was expected to be moved out of intensive care soon, 
Dr. Hector Ramos said at Tampa General Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramos, head of the transplant team, implanted a donated liver  
during a five and a half hour operation. 
</P>
<P>
	``The operation went remarkably well,'' Ramos said. By Friday,  
Knievel was in stable condition, breathing on his own. 
</P>
<P>
	Within six weeks, barring complications, Knievel should be able  
to do just about anything he was used to doing -- including riding 
his motorcycle. Normal recovery time is three-to-six months. 
</P>
<P>
	Attitude helps tremendously, the surgeon said.  
</P>
<P>
	``The will to live and general tenacity of his personality is  
what will be instrumental in his recovery. He's a fighter, of 
course. That's his history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Knievel did not attend the briefing.  
</P>
<P>
	He believes he contracted liver-destroying Hepatitis C during  
the many transfusions he needed following spills on the motorcycle 
circuit in the 1960s and 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	During his career, Knievel broke at least 35 bones and underwent  
surgery 14 times. His motorcycle stunts included a jump over the 
35-foot fountain at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas in 1967 when he 
crushed his pelvis after flying head-over-handlebars. 
</P>
<P>
	One of his most famous stunts failed when a parachute opened as  
he zoomed over Idaho's Snake River Canyon in 1974. The following 
year, a crowd of 90,000 at Wembley Stadium in London watched as he 
soared over 13 double-tiered buses and then crashed, again 
fracturing his pelvis. 
</P>
<P>
	He ended his stunt career in 1981.  
</P>
<P>
	Knievel waited eight months for a new liver. He was hospitalized  
briefly recently with dehydration, which is a common symptom of the 
progression of liver disease, Ramos said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the call came that there was a match, said Krystal  
Kennedy, Knievel's 29-year-old fiancee. Within two hours they were 
at Tampa General. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramos said 70 percent of liver transplant patients get back to  
normal. Knievel still has Hepatitis C and while his new liver does 
not have it, the chances of getting it are high. But the disease is 
not so likely to destroy the organ this time, Ramos said.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Urges Quick End to War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) -- Nigeria's military government has urged a  
quick end to the war in nearby Sierra Leone so it can withdraw its 
troops and prepare for its own political upheaval -- transition to 
civilian rule. 
</P>
<P>
	Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar said he wanted a return to ``peace and  
normalcy'' in Sierra Leone so Nigerian troops fighting there could 
pull out before May 29, when Nigeria's new civilian government will 
be sworn in. 
</P>
<P>
	Abubakar made his comments during a meeting Wednesday with  
Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy, said Mohammed Haruna, 
Abubakar's spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement sent tremors through Freetown, Sierra Leone's  
capital, where Nigerian troops make up most of the West African 
peacekeeping force defending the government of President Ahmed 
Tejan Kabbah against a brutal rebel military campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	The telephone lines of the government-run radio station were  
jammed Thursday with frantic callers saying Nigeria's pullout would 
force them to flee the country, which is embroiled in civil war. 
</P>
<P>
	Sierra Leone has no army. Kabbah disbanded it last year and  
asked the regional peacekeeping force, known as ECOMOG, to help 
train new troops. So far few, if any, soldiers have been trained 
and what indigenous security force exists is made up of unpaid, 
undisciplined militias. 
</P>
<P>
	Abubakar has hinted before at his desire to settle the Sierra  
Leone conflict as he sets the stage for a return to democracy in 
Nigeria after 39 years of mostly military rule. 
</P>
<P>
	A U.N. official familiar with the Nigerian government's  
deliberations over Sierra Leone said Thursday that patience with 
Kabbah has grown thin. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kabbah hasn't taken the initiative to speak with the rebels  
and isn't playing an active role to end the war,'' the official 
said on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The official also said the bodies of up to 30 Nigerian soldiers  
were being transported back home each day, indicating the cost to 
the Nigerian military of battling Revolutionary United Front 
insurgents may be climbing unacceptably high. 
</P>
<P>
	Nigeria once boasted of its leading role in ECOMOG, which won  
wide praise when it reinstated the democratically elected Kabbah to 
power in March after he was deposed in a military coup the year 
before. 
</P>
<P>
	But a rebel offensive in December struck the heart of Freetown,  
badly tarnishing ECOMOG's image.

<HEADLINE> Minority Bidding Program Revised </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Transportation Department announced a new  
rule Friday that revises its Disadvantaged Business Enterprise 
program, which is aimed at ensuring women and minorities get more 
transportation construction contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	Responding to a 1995 Supreme Court ruling, the department will  
no longer require that recipients of state highway, mass transit 
and airport funds set a 10 percent or higher goal for the use of 
minorities in their projects. 
</P>
<P>
	It will now allow states to award contracts -- which are  
supported with federal funds -- based on local market conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	Businesses exceeding small business standards or individuals  
exceeding a $750,000 cap on net worth also will be excluded from 
the program. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, the Supreme Court ruled in a lawsuit by Adarand  
Constructors Inc. against Federico Pena, then the secretary of 
transportation, that not all members of a minority group have a 
right to government preference based solely on historic 
discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
	The court said racial classifications must be narrowly tailored  
to serve a compelling governmental interest. That prompted the DOT 
to revise its rules. 
</P>
<P>
	The DBE program has been the primary Transportation Department  
tool for promoting equal opportunity in federal transportation 
contracting since it was signed into law by then-President Reagan 
in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, the department said that while minorities  
represent more than 20 percent of the population, they own only 9 
percent of all construction firms and receive only about 5 percent 
of construction receipts. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, women represent more than 50 percent of the  
population. In 1994, they also owned a third of all small 
businesses, yet they received less than 3 percent of federal 
procurement contract dollars.

<HEADLINE> Unsafe Sex May Be Increasing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Now that the AIDS epidemic appears to be slowing  
because of medical advances and better drugs, some gay men may be 
returning to unsafe sexual behavior, the federal government said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that the  
number of gay men in San Francisco who reported having unprotected 
anal sex increased to 39.2 percent in 1997, from 30.4 percent in 
1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who said they had unprotected sex with multiple partners  
grew to 33 percent in 1997, up from 23.6 percent in 1994, the CDC 
said Thursday. Males 25 and younger accounted for the largest 
increase in that group. 
</P>
<P>
	The figures came from a street survey of more than 21,000 men.  
The agency said there is growing evidence that young gay and 
bisexual men are less likely to engage in safe sex than older 
counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
	``The younger group hasn't grown up watching their partners and  
friends die of this disease,'' said Dr. Richard Steketee of the 
CDC's HIV/AIDS prevention branch. 
</P>
<P>
	Another sign of the rise in unsafe sex is the rate of reported  
cases of rectal gonorrhea among men. The disease declined in San 
Francisco in the early 1990s but increased from 21 per 100,000 in 
1994 to 38 per 100,000 in 1997, the CDC said. 
</P>
<P>
	Daniel Zingale, executive director of the advocacy group AIDS  
Action in Washington, said the government was partially to blame 
because of a lack of national prevention initiatives to slow the 
spread of the disease. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm afraid that the evidence of the San Francisco study is  
indicative of a problem all around the country,'' Zingale said. 
``While our investment in AIDS care and research is paying off 
through lower death rates, our divestment from HIV prevention is 
creating a new epidemic for a new generation of Americans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the absence of a medical vaccine, prevention should be  
treated as a ``virtual vaccine,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In another study released Thursday, the CDC said that in a  
survey of 97,006 people in the United States in 1996, nearly 42 
percent reported having taken an HIV test. Of those, 22 percent 
said they had taken the test voluntarily.

<HEADLINE> IOC Sends Letter to All Bid Cities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- The IOC on Friday sent a letter to  
every city that sought the Olympics from 1996 to 2004, asking for 
any information about ``inappropriate behavior'' by the bidders. 
</P>
<P>
	In the letter, IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch writes: ``I  
am certain that you are as concerned as the IOC in fully restoring 
the reputation of the IOC and the entire Olympic movement. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hereby ask you for a full and candid report in response to  
this request, including all relevant facts, names and any available 
evidence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A similar letter is to be sent to the six cities bidding for the  
2006 Winter Olympics, along with further instructions on the 
bidding process. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC will meet in March to change its Olympic selection  
procedure. The new proposal calls for a small committee, no the 
general membership, to pick the site. Also, members have been 
banned from visiting candidate cities. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the candidate committees are no longer in existence, the  
letters have been sent to the presidents of the appropriate 
national Olympic committees. The committees have until Feb. 15 to 
reply. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC action comes after the ouster of five members and the  
resignation of another four regarding money they had received 
during the successful campaign by Salt Lake City to hold the 2002 
Winter Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of thousands of dollars were paid to a small number of  
members or their families in return for their votes, an IOC report 
concluded. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigations have widened to include Sydney's success in  
winning the 2000 Olympics and other bids.

<HEADLINE> Barney's Emerges From Bankruptcy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Upscale fashion chain Barney's Inc. emerged  
Thursday from over two years of bankruptcy protection. 
</P>
<P>
	Barney's received $62.5 million in equity from its former  
creditors. The company's primary plan investors, Bay Harbour 
Management and Whippoorwill Associates Inc., now collectively own 
some 70 percent of Barney's outstanding common stock issued in 
accordance with the plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``Throughout this process, we have seen many improvements in the  
way we do business,'' said Barney's president and chief executive 
officer Tom Shull. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most importantly ... the creative spirit and the shopping  
experience that are uniquely Barney's have remained intact,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The reorganization plan was drafted by unsecured creditors for  
Barney's last summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Barney's filed for bankruptcy court protection under Chapter 11  
of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code from its creditors in January 1996 in a 
dispute with Japan's Isetan Co., which had financed Barney's 
extensive expansion during this decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Chapter 11 enables a company to keep operating under a court's  
supervision while it develops a plan for returning to solvency.

<HEADLINE> IOC Widens Salt Lake, Sydney Inquiry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- More IOC members have been targeted in the  
Olympics' biggest corruption scandal, which now covers Sydney as 
well as Salt Lake, the committee's chief investigator said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC vice president Dick Pound said an ``indefinite number'' of  
names from the 106 committee members have been added to the inquiry 
since its initial report on the Salt Lake City case was released 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound refused to identify the recent additions to an  
investigation that already has led to the expulsion or resignation 
of nine members, the biggest purge in the IOC's 105 years. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said fresh information from the ethics commission  
investigating Salt Lake's successful bid for the 2002 Winter Games, 
and news involving Sydney's winning bid for the 2000 Summer Games, 
led to the latest steps. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are looking at some of the other members and not just based  
on information coming out of the Salt Lake City investigation,'' 
Pound said. ``It's an indefinite number and an indefinite line to 
follow. We will go where the trail leads us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Pound commission found that 14 IOC members, including one  
who has since died, took almost $800,000 in cash, travel and 
medical expenses, lavish gifts and services from the Salt Lake bid 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides the resignations and expulsions announced Sunday, the  
IOC said three members remained under investigation and a fourth 
member was warned. 
</P>
<P>
	As Pound's group was finishing its ``first sweep'' of Salt Lake,  
word came that the head of the Australian Olympic Committee 
promised $70,000 to two African IOC members the night before Sydney 
won the 2000 Games by two votes over Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
	One of those members, Charles Mukora of Kenya, also was  
implicated in the Salt Lake case and has resigned. The other member 
was identified as Francis Nyangweso of Uganda. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound said it was ``safe to assume'' his commission was now  
looking at member involvement with the Sydney bid. 
</P>
<P>
	He also expects to look at the failed 1996 bid of Toronto, where  
officials said Thursday they spent more than $500,000 to cover the 
cost of IOC members breaking or stretching rules. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would imagine that they would now come forward with names  
and details,'' Pound said. 
</P>
<P>
	And he said the IOC investigation of Salt Lake remained open,  
based on a full review of reports from the independent Utah ethics 
panel. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound said he had no information on Austin Sealey, an IOC member  
from Barbados who was identified in Friday's Washington Post as a 
possible recipient of money from Salt Lake that was not evident in 
initial reviews. 
</P>
<P>
	The Salt Lake Tribune, meanwhile, said investigators had  
subpoenaed University of Utah records of Bold Magvan, a son of IOC 
member Shagdarjav Magvan of Mongolia. 
</P>
<P>
	In Paris, Jean-Claude Ganga of the Republic of Congo said he had  
40 members who would vote to reinstate him to the IOC at a special 
assembly in March. Pound said such a reversal probably would force 
the ruling executive board, of which he is a member, to resign. 
</P>
<P>
	``That would be a serious point of non-confidence,'' Pound said.  
He said he would be ``very surprised'' if the expulsions were 
overturned. 
</P>
<P>
	When he announced the expulsions, IOC president Juan Antonio  
Samaranch said all bid cities from the 1996 Games onward would be 
asked to identify members who acted improperly in the bidding. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound said those letters were to be mailed from IOC headquarters  
in Lausanne, Switzerland, on Friday, with a Feb. 16 deadline to 
reply, about two weeks later than originally intended but still in 
time for the investigations to be finished by the special session 
March 17-18. 
</P>
<P>
	And in another of the six investigations of Olympic bidding  
around the world, the U.S. Olympic Committee said the report of its 
special inquiry on Salt Lake, led by former Senate Majority Leader 
George Mitchell, would be released March 1. 
</P>
<P>
	In other developments:  
</P>
<P>
	--USA Today said Ganga and former Salt Lake Olympics chief Tom  
Welch shared a bank account. Welch's lawyer, Tom Schaffer, said 
Welch's name was on the account so he could get funds for Ganga if 
Ganga was out of the country. Welch, the lawyer added, never made a 
deposit or withdrawal from the account. 
</P>
<P>
	--Ganga told the French newspaper Liberation that Samaranch was  
sacrificing friends in the scandal to try to clear his own name. 
</P>
<P>
	--Samaranch resigned as president of La Caixa, Spain's  
fourth-largest bank. The 78-year-old IOC president said he was 
leaving because of his age, not the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	--Sergio Santander, expelled from the IOC in the Salt Lake case,  
was suspended as president of the Chilean Olympic Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	--Two proprietors of a defunct Salt Lake escort service told the  
Tribune their escorts entertained IOC members at hotels during 
visits in 1995. They did not say who paid for the escorts. 
</P>
<P>
	--A Browning rifle given to Samaranch by Salt Lake organizers is  
worth much more than the $671 listed, KTVX in Salt Lake reported. 
Leon Burrows, who designed the gun's engraving, told the TV station 
the gun could sell for up to $25,000. 
</P>
<P>
	--The Olympics' top TV organizer, Manolo Romero, reportedly was  
paid $1.5 million for his services during the 1992 Barcelona Games. 
Spanish sports authorities defended Barcelona's finances against 
the report in the newspaper El Mundo.

<HEADLINE> Suns Sign Respert to One-Year Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- The Phoenix Suns, in search of a backup guard,  
signed free agent Shawn Respert to a one-year contract Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Respert, an All-American at Michigan State, will try to revive  
what has been a disappointing NBA career. 
</P>
<P>
	Portland selected Respert as the eighth pick overall in the 1995  
draft, then sent him to Milwaukee in a draft-day trade for the 
Bucks' pick, Gary Trent, and a 1996 first-round selection. 
</P>
<P>
	He was traded to Toronto in February of 1997 for Acie Earl, and  
was the first guard off the bench for the Raptors. 
</P>
<P>
	Respert started last season with Toronto, then was released and  
signed to a pair of 10-day contracts with Dallas. He averaged 5.9 
points in 57 games with the Raptors and Mavericks. 
</P>
<P>
	At Michigan State, Respert was the school's career leading  
scorer with 2,351 points. He was named college basketball player of 
the year by The Sporting News in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	But at 6-foot-2, his lack of height made it hard for him to  
defend the bigger shooting guards in the NBA. At Phoenix, point 
guard Jason Kidd will be able to go against many of those bigger 
guards, allowing the Suns to play Respert at shooting guard on 
offense and point guard on defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't had a chance to blossom yet out on the floor,''  
Respert told The Arizona Republic. 
</P>
<P>
	Respert's field goal shooting has improved from 38.7 percent as  
a rookie to 44.4 percent last season. He has shot .342 from 3-point 
range in his three NBA seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Suns general manager Bryan Colangelo said he also expects to  
re-sign Martin Muursepp. Muursepp was traded, along with Mark 
Bryant, Bubba Wells and a first-round draft pick, to Chicago for 
Luc Longley. But the Bulls promptly waived Muursepp. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, coach Danny Ainge said Marko Milic will start at  
shooting guard in place of Rex Chapman in Phoenix's first 
exhibition game Saturday night in Dallas. Chapman has been bothered 
by a sore hamstring.

<HEADLINE> Croatia's Kostelic Seeks Ski Medal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VAIL, Colo. (AP) -- Janica Kostelic appears as relaxed as the  
sagest veteran heading into the World Alpine Ski Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	And why not? She doesn't have a clue what to expect.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm only 17. What do I know?'' the young Croatian said after a  
training session Friday. ``I don't feel like it's a World 
Championships. It's like I'm at some World Cup race, nothing 
special.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Inexperienced as she may be in the ways of the ski world,  
Kostelic is no kid. Based on performances so far in her rookie 
season, she's a threat to win a medal when the world's best skiers 
begin competing Monday. She ranks eighth in the World Cup overall 
standings, sixth in the giant slalom and eighth in slalom. 
</P>
<P>
	As the only woman on Croatia's fledgling Alpine team, Kostelic  
will compete in every event. Her first race comes Monday in the 
super-G, the opener of the two-week championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Kostelic stood on her first World Cup podium in only her third  
race, finishing third in a slalom at Park City, Utah. She then 
placed third in a slalom at St. Anton, Austria, earlier this month. 
The slalom helped her claim her first World Cup victory, the St. 
Anton combined. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like I'm not ready for podiums yet,'' Kostelic said.  
``I'm 17, and I look at Hilde Gerg (Germany's 1998 Olympic slalom 
champion) and Pernilla Wiberg (Sweden's three-time World 
Championship gold medalist) -- five years ago I was watching them 
win. I have something special in my head watching them and I can't 
imagine myself on the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just a kid and a lot of stuff that's in my head is like in  
a child's head and they are 26-year-old girls who are so much ahead 
of me in my skiing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alexandra Meissnitzer, the Austrian who leads this season's  
overall World Cup standings, was once a child prodigy and has an 
idea what Kostelic's thinking. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think maybe the reason she's acting cool is because she is  
17,'' Meissnitzer, 25, said. ``She doesn't have the pressure and 
she's just going for it. She has a lot of potential. Her technique 
is really good for a 17-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was surprised when I saw her this year in Park City. We all  
said, `OK, here comes another young one.' I think if she keeps 
going, she'll be really strong in the coming years, especially for 
the overall World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not important whether you're winning at 17 or 25; the  
most important thing is that you are winning.''

<HEADLINE> Washington's Gray Hurt in NBA Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Washington forward Evric Gray was taken off  
the court on a stretcher Friday night after a hard collision under 
the basket in the Wizards' exhibition game against Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	Gray, who was knocked unconscious and cut on the head, was  
admitted to a hospital and received a CT scan as a precaution. He 
was expected to be released on Saturday, Sixers spokesman Bill 
Bonsiewicz said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's always tough to see someone get hurt,'' Wizards coach  
Bernie Bickerstaff said. ``He got some guys up in the air, and they 
came down on him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gray was driving to the basket with 3:43 left in the game when  
he was fouled by 76ers rookie Casey Shaw, whose elbow appeared to 
hit the top of Gray's head. Trainers and courtside attendants 
rushed to the basket, where Gray lay with his eyes closed for more 
than 10 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were trying to figure out what hit him,'' Shaw said. ``The  
ref said that my elbow hit him on the head. But I didn't feel it, 
and neither did Nazr (Mohammed). It's scary to see something like 
that happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, Gray did nod and shake his head in response to  
questions as trainers toweled off his head. Players from both teams 
gathered around out of concern for the second-year player from 
UNLV. 
</P>
<P>
	Gray was fitted with a neck brace, and the top of his head was  
bandaged as he was lifted onto the stretcher.

<HEADLINE> IOC Urged To Take Action Vs. Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The IOC must take strong action at next week's  
world drug summit or risk further damage to an organization already 
reeling from a historic corruption scandal, a top American Olympic 
official said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	With Olympic bid practices the targets of at least six  
investigations and calls growing for a change at the top of the 
International Olympic Committee, any sign of weakness on doping 
would be crippling, U.S. Olympic Committee executive director Dick 
Schultz said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the perception is that they are backing off on the drug  
issue, it will add fuel to the fire,'' Schultz said. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC called the summit last fall, after months of headlines  
over performance-enhancing drug use in cycling's Tour de France, 
top-level track and field and even the Italian soccer league. 
</P>
<P>
	The situation boiled over when Samaranch, in an interview with a  
Spanish newspaper, said the list of banned drugs should be sharply 
cut and punishment limited to those cases in which the athlete is 
physically harmed. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, drugs in sports was by far the biggest problem  
facing the Olympic community. 
</P>
<P>
	But late last year, the issue was overrun by the scandal in Salt  
Lake City, where officials said they offered scholarships to 
relatives of IOC members to try to sway their votes for the 2002 
Winter Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	That scandal has since spread worldwide, with the IOC expelling  
five members and four others resigning, the biggest purge in the 
committee's 105-year history. 
</P>
<P>
	At least three other members remain under investigation by the  
IOC, and additional inquiries involve the Justice Department, the 
Utah attorney general's office, the USOC and Olympic organizing 
committees in Salt Lake and Nagano. 
</P>
<P>
	White House drug czar Barry McCaffrey, who will head a U.S.  
government delegation to the summit, said this week that the 
bribery scandal may have left the IOC unable to ``successfully face 
this (doping) issue unless we have some institutional reforms.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said that could include the ``need to examine the requirement  
for new leadership to take us into the next era,'' although he 
stopped short of calling for Samaranch's replacement. 
</P>
<P>
	Schultz, in a telephone interview from his Colorado Springs,  
Colo., office, said drugs should remain the focus of the 
first-of-its-kind meeting of international officials in Lausanne, 
Switzerland, on Tuesday through Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the world of sports, it's far more important than the other  
scandal,'' said Schultz, who heads the USOC delegation to the 
summit and who has been closely involved in the scandal inquiries. 
``It's important for the world to know that its athletes are clean 
and honest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Schultz said McCaffrey, who has pledged an unprecedented $1  
million in federal funds to pay for drug-testing research, was 
right to connect the two issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the IOC takes strong action, it will be OK,'' he said. ``If  
there is any sign of weakness in not wanting to deal forcefully 
with this, then McCaffrey will have been proved correct.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schultz said the 10-member USOC delegation, which also includes  
former athletes Frank Shorter, Bill Stapleton and Jonathan Fish, 
will present a 10-point plan calling for extensive international 
drug testing by a well-financed independent authority, and adoption 
of uniform drug penalties by the IOC, national Olympic committees 
and international sports federations.

<HEADLINE> Report: Rodman May Play for Magic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Dennis Rodman may soon be reunited with  
coach Chuck Daly on the Orlando Magic. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orlando Sentinel, citing NBA sources it did not identify,  
reported Friday that Dwight Manley, who resigned as Rodman's agent 
Thursday, informed the Miami Heat earlier this week of Rodman's 
intention to join the Magic. 
</P>
<P>
	Daly, who coached Rodman for six years in Detroit, has already  
expressed interest in Rodman, who is known as much for his 
off-the-court antics, tattoos, body piercings and multicolored hair 
styles as he is for his rebounding prowess. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami coach Pat Riley had said earlier this week that he was  
interested in signing Rodman if he agreed to follow team rules. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he plays anywhere, I would think it would be in Orlando  
with Chuck,'' Riley said. ``They've had a good relationship for a 
long time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman and Daly teamed in Detroit to win NBA titles in 1989 and  
1990. Rodman, 37, has also won NBA titles during the past three 
seasons as a member of the Chicago Bulls before becoming a free 
agent this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I talked to Dennis about a week or two ago, but in general  
terms,'' Daly said Thursday. ``We have talked about it. I'm 
definitely interested.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Team sources indicate that as recently as Tuesday, there was a  
meeting between president Bob Vander Weide, general manager John 
Gabriel and Daly to discuss whether to pursue Rodman, the newspaper 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Because the Magic are over the NBA's team salary cap of $30  
million, they can only offer Rodman the league's $1 million minimum 
salary for veterans. Rodman made in excess of $10 million last 
season with the Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know where we are with money and such,'' Daly said.  
``But we'll see where it goes. We've had extensive talks about it. 
He had indicated his interest in us. How much, I don't know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Magic open the season next Friday against the New York  
Knicks in Orlando Arena.

<HEADLINE> Riley Plans To Overhaul of Chargers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- New coach Mike Riley of the San Diego Chargers,  
putting the final touches on his staff, said Friday that Geep 
Chryst, quarterbacks coach of the Arizona Cardinals, will be his 
offensive coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
	Together they will undertake the renovation of Ryan Leaf.  
</P>
<P>
	Leaf struggled through a wreck of a rookie season, finishing  
with two touchdowns, 15 interceptions and the lowest quarterback 
rating in the league. San Diego's 241 points was the second lowest 
in the league and Riley knows any improvement for the 5-11 Chargers 
must start with the $31.25 million quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ryan needs to take a step back to sit in, work hard and get  
ready to improve,'' Riley said. ``Here is a guy who had some 
problems. We've got to teach him what being a pro is all about. I 
think he's talented, but the one glaring weakness of the team has 
been the passing game. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to look at the things he feels good about. He's part  
of the big picture, the key to the future. He's got to have some 
success. We've got to help him have that success.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of Riley's plans is to reduce the language of play-calling.  
``It's going to be five words maximum, not 15,'' he said. ``Limited 
verbiage helps a guy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another is to bring in a veteran quarterback to help Leaf along.  
Mark Rypien is one possibility. 
</P>
<P>
	Riley said he spoke to Leaf shortly after being hired by the  
Chargers. ``He's excited about a fresh start,'' the coach said. 
</P>
<P>
	So is Riley.  
</P>
<P>
	The new coach signed a five-year contract on Jan. 7, leaving  
Oregon State after two seasons. The Beavers were 3-8 in his first 
season and improved to 5-6 last year, the school's best record in 
27 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Riley was out recruiting, with no thought about the NFL, when he  
heard from old friend Bobby Beathard, general manager of the 
Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got a call and was asked, `Would something like this be of  
interest?' '' he said. ``I said, `Yeah, it would be. I know you, 
Bobby. I like the West Coast.' I thought that might be the last 
call.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He didn't even mention it to his wife, Dee.  
</P>
<P>
	``Then at halftime of their last game, I got a call from the  
press box,'' he said. ``Then I called Dee and said I think there 
might be something to this. I was surprised by the whole chain of 
events. I didn't think the track I was on was the track to go to an 
NFL team. 
</P>
<P>
	``Then it got difficult. I loved the job I was doing and where I  
was living. Every job I've had has been special and important to 
me. I was having fun. The program was getting better. The kids were 
excited.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, this was the NFL. There are only 31 jobs at this level.  
The opportunity does not come along every day. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many times before, I thought I'd like to be a coordinator or a  
quarterbacks coach,'' Riley said. ``But what the heck, they didn't 
offer me that job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Riley has also been a head coach in the Canadian Football League  
with Winnipeg and World League with San Antonio. He also was an 
assistant coach at Southern California and faced Leaf when the 
quarterback was at Washington State. 
</P>
<P>
	``He played well, moved the team down the field,'' Riley said.  
``We won the game.''

<HEADLINE> S.C. Boat Wreck Families File Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) -- The families of four people killed when  
their sailboat sank on a windswept Charleston Harbor jetty have 
taken their $35 million claim against the government to federal 
court. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit stemming from the Dec. 29, 1997, wreck faults the Coast  
Guard for failing to launch a search for the Morning Dew despite a 
mayday call and a subsequent report of voices in the water. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Transportation Safety Board opens a hearing here  
Wednesday into the Coast Guard's response. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Cornett, 49; his two teen-age sons, Michael Paul, 16,  
and Daniel, 13; and their cousin, Bobby Hurd, 14, died in the 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Their families earlier filed a $35 million administrative claim  
that the Coast Guard rejected, saying while it has discretion to 
start a search, it is under no legal obligation to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	Senior Chief Petty Officer Glenn Rosenholm, a Coast Guard  
spokesman, said Friday the agency would not comment on the suit or 
the wreck until after the NTSB hearing.

<HEADLINE> Court Lets Raiders Sue Over Uniform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- The Oakland Raiders can go to court,  
rather than arbitration, with their claims that the NFL watered 
down the commercial value of their pirate insignia and silver and 
black colors, says a state appeals court. 
</P>
<P>
	The Raiders say their rights were violated when the NFL let the  
Tampa Bay Buccaneers use crossed swords in their insignia and 
approved ``ebony and pewter'' colors for the Carolina Panthers. The 
suit also challenges a league requirement that coaches wear Nike 
clothing on the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 3-0 ruling Thursday, the 6th District Court of Appeal  
upheld a judge's ruling allowing the Raiders to pursue those claims 
in court, rejecting the league's argument that arbitration was 
required. 
</P>
<P>
	The claims are part of a suit, filed in February 1996, accusing  
the NFL of mismanagement in its merchandise sales and of unfair 
treatment in retaliation for the Raiders' previous suits against 
the league over their move to Los Angeles in 1982. They returned to 
Oakland in 1995 and have a separate suit pending against the city 
and Alameda County over their lease. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit against the NFL is tentatively scheduled to go to trial  
April 19 in Santa Clara County Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling ``means that Commissioner (Paul) Tagliabue will have  
to answer in a court of law for the backroom dealing and 
discriminatory treatment that he has utilized and will not be able 
to hide these claims in an arbitration proceeding,'' Kenneth G. 
Hausman, a lawyer for the Raiders, said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the Raiders accounted for nearly 25 percent of the  
league's merchandise sales in 1991 and less than 5 percent today. 
Tagliabue became commissioner in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	Telephone calls to lawyers for the league and an NFL spokesman  
were not returned. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling involved the Raiders' claims that their colors and  
logo -- a man wearing an eye patch and a helmet with a backdrop of 
crossed swords -- had become so closely associated with the team 
over the years that they acquired trademark-type protection. Their 
value was diluted when the league approved similar colors for the 
Panthers and a skull and crossed-swords emblem for the Buccaneers, 
the suit said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Raiders also said the NFL, which legally requires players to  
wear Nike uniforms and other gear, has no such authority over the 
clothing of coaches and other sideline personnel, and has 
interfered in the team's marketing. 
</P>
<P>
	The league contended those claims must be arbitrated by  
Tagliabue, under NFL bylaws that entitle the commissioner to 
resolve disputes involving two or more teams, including disputes 
over colors and helmet design. 
</P>
<P>
	But the appeals court, in an opinion by Presiding Justice Eugene  
Premo, said the claims against the Panthers and Buccaneers could 
not be arbitrated because the Raiders are seeking injunctions 
requiring those teams to change their colors and insignia. 
California law allows only judges, not arbitrators, to issue 
injunctions, Premo said. 
</P>
<P>
	The claim about coaches' apparel was filed only against NFL  
Properties, a separate entity from the league, which did not appeal 
the ruling on arbitration, Premo said.

<HEADLINE> Gas Station Owner Clings to Car </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SHIP BOTTOM, N.J. (AP) -- Fourteen dollars worth of unleaded  
regular nearly cost a gas station owner his life. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Thomas clung to the hood of a car driven at high speeds by  
a customer who tried to run him over after a dispute over how much 
gas he pumped. 
</P>
<P>
	The woman repeatedly sped up and slammed on the brakes, trying  
to dislodge him from the front of her vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
	It started Tuesday morning when Judith Piorkowski pulled into  
the Amoco Station on the main drag that runs the length of Long 
Beach Island. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas said the woman ordered a fill-up, which came to $14. But  
she said she only had $5, and had only asked for that much gas. 
When she asked if she could pay the rest next week, Thomas said no. 
</P>
<P>
	She started to drive away, but he reached inside and switched  
off the ignition. 
</P>
<P>
	He was standing in front of the car trying to memorize its  
license plate number when she started it up again and came straight 
at him, police said. He jumped onto the hood to avoid being run 
over, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was holding onto the windshield wiper and the radio  
antenna,'' Thomas said. ``It was interesting when she was trying to 
shake me off and turned on the windshield wiper. It got more 
interesting when she turned on the windshield washer spray.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police said the ride ended without injury when the woman drove  
past a police officer, who puller her over. She was charged with 
robbery and aggravated assault, and released on $15,000 bail. Her 
home number in Beach Haven is unlisted. 
</P>
<P>
	While clinging to the hood at speeds he estimated at 75 to 80  
mph, Thomas was thinking two things. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was thinking, `How am I going to get off of here?' '' he  
said. ``I was also thinking I should have let her pay next week.''

<HEADLINE> NBA '99: Long Layoff May Hurt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Finally, the distinctive squeak of new sneakers on polished  
hardwood, the rhythmic thumping of basketballs dribbled downcourt 
and the sweet sound of ``thwap'' when it's nothing but net. 
</P>
<P>
	But what's that? Huffing and puffing, moans and groans and  
occasional shrieks? 
</P>
<P>
	The long layoff, shortened training camps and grueling, crammed  
season will most likely take their toll on NBA players this season. 
Sprains, pulled muscles and torn ligaments are expected to be far 
more common than during the usual 82-game schedules. 
</P>
<P>
	Sure, teams will play just 50 games, but they have to do it in  
90 days. Many players were turned into bench potatoes during the 
6 1/2-month lockout and are now rushing to work off the rust and flab, 
which can lead to disaster. 
</P>
<P>
	Shawn Kemp, for example, showed up at Cleveland Cavaliers camp  
reportedly as much as 45 pounds over his old playing weight of 256 
from his days in Seattle. With many others also out of shape, 
trainers should be ready to hear screams of ``Get the ice!'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We always worry about injuries, and it will be an even bigger  
issue this year,'' Lakers coach Del Harris said. ``We can't keep 
them in a vacuum, in a jar somewhere, because we have to play 
basketball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Well, some players do, anyway. Others are already watching from  
the sideline, recovering from injuries in the first couple of weeks 
since the lockout ended. 
</P>
<P>
	A partial list: Miami's Voshon Lenard (broken shin); the Nets'  
Kerry Kittles (knee) and Rony Seikaly (ankle); Minnesota's Joe 
Smith (ankle) and Anthony Peeler (knee); Charlotte's Glen Rice 
(elbow); and Seattle's Billy Owens (knee) and Detlef Schrempf 
(thigh). 
</P>
<P>
	Indiana Pacers trainer David Craig predicts there will be many  
more to add. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're used to four weeks of getting into basketball shape,''  
he said. ``Now were nailing that down to a week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Teams originally were scheduled to report on Oct. 6, begin their  
slate of about eight exhibition games at midmonth, and open the 
season in early November. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, they're getting 15 days of formal camp and two  
exhibitions before beginning the hectic grind of the season on Feb. 
5. Before the lockout ended, it was up to the players to stay in 
shape on their own by hitting the weights and playing in pickup 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	``You just pray to God that they did something to get into  
condition,'' Pacers coach Larry Bird said. ``You don't have time to 
get them into a decent condition to play basketball when you really 
haven't done that much. 
</P>
<P>
	``It usually takes guys about five regular-season games to get  
into some type of condition with a full training camp.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And, of course, there were no full training camps. Players  
haven't put up a shot that counts in eight months or so, unless 
they count that big pickup game at the Y during the lockout. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't get in shape until a coach is yelling at you,''  
Minnesota Timberwolves coach Flip Saunders said. ``They might think 
they're in shape. I think we put out extra buckets in case some 
guys threw up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the concerns, some feel that the players who will get  
hurt this season probably would have gotten injured during a 
regular season, too. After all, the lockout shouldn't have changed 
the attitude of players committed to their conditioning -- or others 
who are lazy. 
</P>
<P>
	``The ones that didn't stay in shape probably will get  
overuse-type injuries -- stress fractures, muscle sprains and 
strains,'' said Tony Daly, the Los Angeles Clippers' team doctor. 
``The conscientious ones, and that's the wide majority of the 
players, stay in shape all year long. Years ago, they would wait 
until training camp to get in shape, and those days have ended. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't really anticipate that big a deal.''  
</P>
<P>
	To try to avoid a ``big deal,'' most coaches will give their  
regulars ample rest early, shuttling reserves in and out. Teams 
will carry 14 players, rather than the usual 12, for the first two 
weeks of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to see a number of guys playing probably less  
minutes than in the past because of the prevention of injuries, and 
also because of the conditioning concerns we have,'' said Tim 
Floyd, new coach of the Chicago Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
	With the NBA hoping to woo disenchanted fans back in the wake of  
the lockout, injuries could hurt a team in more ways than just the 
won-loss column. When stars go down, so does interest. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Grant Hill from the Pistons goes out or Ray Allen from  
Milwaukee gets hurt, that has to have a big effect on their ticket 
sales,'' Lakers point guard Derek Fisher said. ``As soon as 
somebody's star player goes down, that puts a team in a totally bad 
situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lakers star Shaquille O'Neal missed 22 games last year with a  
strained abdominal muscle. Although the 7-foot-1, 320-pound center 
showed up for camp in good shape, trainer Gary Vitti said it was 
especially difficult for big players to get ready for this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's easy for guards to find somebody to go one-on-one with  
(during the time off), but it's not easy for players like Shaq to 
find somebody to go against, who can really challenge them,'' Vitti 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	While the NBA had not had a season shortened by a labor dispute  
before, major league baseball, the NFL and NHL did. Hockey players, 
in fact, faced a similar situation in the 1994-95 season, when a 
lockout reduced their schedule to 48 games. 
</P>
<P>
	NHL Hall of Famer Phil Esposito, former general manager of the  
Tampa Bay Lightning, recalls worrying about injuries at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I think the players kept themselves in shape,'' he said.  
``I think they probably showed up in better shape than some of the 
basketball players have.''

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Wants Topless Bar Removed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- A publicly traded topless bar company is in  
jeopardy of being stripped of its stock market listing. 
</P>
<P>
	Rick's Cabaret International Inc., a small chain of adult  
entertainment clubs based in Houston, filed an appeal with the 
Nasdaq Stock Market on Friday to prevent the exchange from 
delisting the company. 
</P>
<P>
	Had it not filed the appeal, Rick's would have been delisted  
after the close of business Friday because of the company's anemic 
share price. The company will now get a hearing to convince a 
Nasdaq panel it should remain listed. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Rick's closed at 46 7/8 cents Friday. After peaking in  
June 1998 at $4.37 1/2, the stock price dove sharply and by September 
had sunk below $1, a level it hasn't topped since. 
</P>
<P>
	To hold onto its listing, Rick's share price must remain above  
$1 for 10 straight business days. 
</P>
<P>
	After losing nearly $1.3 million in 1997, Rick's followed up  
with a loss of about $605,000 last year. 
</P>
<P>
	In a release, Rick's attributed the most recent losses to  
start-up costs of its new topless bar in Minneapolis, the purchase 
of a company that held two Houston cabarets and one in Austin and 
declining revenues from its original Houston club. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Watters, president of Rick's, did not return repeated  
telephone messages left this week by The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Nasdaq initially rejected Watters' application to go public in  
1995, but he was able to convince the exchange that his was a 
licensed business that met the exchange's requirements. Its share 
prices have ranged as high as nearly $6 to a low of 25 cents.

<HEADLINE> Cavs Extend Ilgauskas' Contract </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Zydrunas Ilgauskas couldn't wait until morning  
to tell his family back in Lithuania the good news: he was staying 
in Ohio and he was rich. 
</P>
<P>
	Ilgauskas, a 7-foot-3 center who would have been a free agent  
after this season, signed a six-year contract extension with the 
Cavaliers, the team announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cavs didn't announce terms of the deal but it is believed to  
be worth $70.875 million, the maximum allowed to a player entering 
his third season under the NBA's new collective bargaining 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	It took only a few hours for Ilgauskas' agent, Herb Rudoy, to  
work out a deal with the Cavaliers on Thursday. The 23-year-old 
Ilgauskas averaged nearly 14 points as a rookie last season, and 
the Cavs quickly realized his potential was too much to pass up. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had the goods,'' said Rudoy. ``When you've got the goods  
it's not hard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Once the deal was finalized Thursday night, Ilgauskas, 'Z' to  
his teammates and Cavs' fans, telephoned his family despite it 
being 1 a.m. in Lithuania. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were all sleeping,'' Ilgauskas said. ``But I talked to  
them and they were very happy. They like Cleveland a lot, they've 
been here a lot and they really like it here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With a 4-to-1 exchange rate, Ilgauskas' contract would be worth  
over $280 million litas in his homeland. But he said that's not why 
he's staying in Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not about the money,'' he said. ``I wanted to stay here  
because the Cavaliers gave me a chance prove myself as a player and 
I think we have a great future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ilgauskas was the Cavs' first-round pick in the 1996 NBA Draft,  
but had to sit out the entire '96-97 season when he broke his right 
foot for the second time in two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Many wondered if Cleveland wasn't wasting its time with an  
unproven center who appeared injury-prone and lacking the physical 
tools to play in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	But he bulked up (he now weighs 260) and healthy, 'Z' blossomed  
last season, averaging 13.9 points per game and 8.8 rebounds for 
the young Cavaliers. He was one of four Cavs named to the 
All-Rookie team and took home MVP honors during the All-Star 
weekend rookie game in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cavs feel that Ilgauskas' signing not only shows a  
commitment to the future, but along with All-Star forward Shawn 
Kemp, it gives Cleveland coach Mike Fratello stability and the 
cornerstones for a championship contender. 
</P>
<P>
	``All you have to do is look back at the teams that have won the  
NBA championships, dating back to Chicago and Detroit,'' said 
Fratello. ``They kept their nucleus together. They had those people 
in place and what they did is they built and added around them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ilgauskas had 11 points and nine rebounds in 23 minutes in an  
83-78 exhibition loss to Detroit Friday night at Gund Arena.

<HEADLINE>  Grant Fighting Way to Top </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) -- Some call Michael Grant the future of  
the heavyweight division. But Grant, who puts his unbeaten record 
on the line Saturday night, is in no hurry to get to the top. 
</P>
<P>
	``A patient spirit is a good spirit. I'm not in a rush,'' said  
Grand, who will fight Ahmad Abdin. ``I've always said I'd like 
Lennox (Lewis), but whoever's got the belt, I'll fight them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Grant, a chiseled 6-foot-7-inch native of Chicago fighting out  
of Norristown, Pa., has won all 28 of his fights since turning pro 
in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, he stopped David Izon in five rounds and Obed  
Sullivan in nine. He was scheduled to fight September, but he 
couldn't because he came down with hepatitis. 
</P>
<P>
	He weighed in at 250 pounds his fight for the vacant NABF title  
against Abdin, of Houston, 243. 
</P>
<P>
	In the co-feature, Andrew Golota will take on 41-year-old  
journeyman Jesse Ferguson, a substitute for Jimmy Thunder, who 
suffered an Achilles tendon injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Ferguson, who is 26-17, has won six of his last seven fights,  
including a 10-round decision over Sullivan last month. Golota, 
32-3, weighed in at 238 on Friday, Ferguson at 239. 
</P>
<P>
	The fights, in a 3,000-seat ballroom at Convention Hall, will be

<HEADLINE> 49ers' Field Among NFL's Worst </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- NFL players prefer working on natural grass, unless  
it's in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	Grass fields in Chicago, New England, Oakland and San Diego rate  
better, but not by much. 
</P>
<P>
	A study released Thursday ranked the field at 3Com Park, home of  
the 49ers, as the fifth-worst in the league. The Bears, Patriots, 
Raiders and Chargers all finished in the bottom 15. 
</P>
<P>
	The best field was the natural playing surface in Tampa Bay's  
new Raymond James Stadium. The worst was the artificial turf in 
Philadelphia's Veterans Stadium, despite a new carpet that was 
installed two years ago at a cost of $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Eagles and the Phillies had a major role in selecting the  
product ... and $2 million certainly buys you a good piece of 
carpet,'' said Jim Smith, spokesman for the stadium's management 
firm. ``Some players aren't aware that it's new turf and don't 
bother to compare what they have in mind with reality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The survey by the NFL Players Association covered 29 fields. The  
NFL has 30 teams, but the New York Jets and Giants share a stadium 
at the Meadowlands in New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	3Com Park's ranking marked the first time a grass surface  
finished that low. The San Francisco field was ranked the 
13th-worst surface five years ago and seventh-worst in a 1996 
study. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the results show that players not only are concerned  
about the kind of surface they play on, but whether those fields 
are properly maintained,'' said Richard Berthelsen, chief counsel 
for the NFLPA. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides Veterans Stadium, three other stadiums with carpet --  
Cincinnati's Cinergy Field, Pittsburgh's Three Rivers Stadium and 
Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J. -- ranked below 3Com Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Tampa Bay's grass field was first in two previous union surveys,  
but that was in the team's former home, Houlihan's Stadium. 
Philadelphia ranked last in each of the studies. 
</P>
<P>
	Carolina's Ericsson Stadium was second behind Tampa Bay,  
followed by three more natural surfaces at Jacksonville's Alltel 
Stadium, Miami's Pro Player Stadium and Baltimore's PSINet Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Players overwhelmingly preferred grass surfaces. A total of 957  
responded to the survey, with 87 percent preferring natural turf. 
More players said they had no preference than preferred artificial 
turf, 8 percent to 5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Given the need to stay competitive in this day of free agency,  
we anticipate that many NFL clubs will recognize that converting 
to, or maintaining a first-class natural grass playing field, is 
paramount in attracting topflight talent,'' NFLPA executive 
director Gene Upshaw said. 
</P>
<P>
	Players were nearly unanimous in their belief that artificial  
turf is more likely than grass to contribute to injuries, and about 
90 percent said it is more likely to shorten their careers. 
</P>
<P>
	About half the respondents said they suffered an injury on  
artificial turf that would not have happened on grass. Almost nine 
of every 10 said playing on an artificial surface will worsen their 
quality of life after football. 
</P>
<P>
	Pro Player Stadium, site of this year's Super Bowl, ranked  
fourth-best, down from the second-place ranking it held in the 
previous studies. 
</P>
<P>
	The Atlanta Falcons and Denver Broncos will play Sunday on what  
is essentially a new field, installed by a company run by golfer 
Greg Norman.

<HEADLINE> Mary Slaney's Drug Hearing Begins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTE CARLO, Monaco (AP) -- The controversial hearing into  
distance runner Mary Slaney's drug case began Friday with the IAAF 
presenting evidence that it said shows she took 
performance-enhancing testosterone. 
</P>
<P>
	The International Amateur Athletic Federation said a urine  
sample given during the 1996 U.S. Olympic trials showed that Slaney 
had a testosterone-epitestosterone (T-E) ratio above the 6-1 limit. 
</P>
<P>
	Testosterone is a naturally-occurring hormone that builds muscle  
mass. 
</P>
<P>
	The T-E ratio normally is 1-1. If an athlete's urine sample  
shows a ratio of 6-1 or higher, that triggers further tests and a 
formal investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The IAAF rejects Slaney's claim that the ratio was not accurate  
for women in their late 30s who are taking the birth control pill. 
</P>
<P>
	The IAAF suspended Slaney in May 1997, claiming that USA Track &AMP;  
Field was slow in investigating the matter. 
</P>
<P>
	USATF then imposed its own suspension. But Slaney challenged the  
ruling, and in September 1997, USATF cleared her of the charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the IAAF cleared Slaney to compete, it refused to accept  
the USATF ruling and referred the case to arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
	Three judges will decide the case: Germany's Christoph Vedder,  
the panel's chairman; Robert Ellicott of Australia, and Singapore's 
Lin Kokloh. 
</P>
<P>
	They are expected to make a decision Monday, though the IAAF has  
up to two weeks to make it public. 
</P>
<P>
	Slaney, considered the best women's distance runner in U.S.  
history, was represented by her legal team and Craig Masback, chief 
executive of USATF. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are very confident that the decision taken by USA Track &AMP;  
Field was correct and that scientific evidence supports that,'' Jim 
Coleman, Slaney's attorney, said. ``If the hearing is based on that 
alone, we are confident that we will win.''

<HEADLINE> Charges Dropped Vs. Saints Player </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GRETNA, La. (AP) -- The Jefferson Parish District Attorney's  
Office dropped charges Friday against New Orleans Saints offensive 
lineman Keno Hills, who was arrested in December for possession of 
heroin. 
</P>
<P>
	Hills originally was booked with possession with intent to  
distribute seven small packages of heroin after deputies saw him 
and another man peering into a pouch containing the drug. If 
convicted on the charges, he could face life in jail. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, Assistant District Attorney Bob Long said  
investigators had been unable to prove Hills was guilty of any 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
	Hills and 27-year-old James Davis, of Metairie, were arrested in  
an area known for drug deals. In addition to the substance believed 
to be heroin, a 9 mm pistol equipped with a laser was found in the 
car. 
</P>
<P>
	The arrest occurred less than 48 hours after the Saints had  
completed their 6-10 season with a loss to the Buffalo Bills, a 
game in which Hills, 25, a backup most of the season, had started.

<HEADLINE> Feds Plan New Child Seat Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The same, simple system would anchor all child  
safety seats in new cars, under a rule the government soon plans to 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
	The rule has passed its final hurdle, review by the Office of  
Management and Budget, and awaits only the formal announcement. 
Department of Transportation officials said Thursday they have not 
yet set that date. 
</P>
<P>
	The rule would require automakers to outfit new cars with a  
single type of anchorage system so parents can avoid the struggle 
to secure the seat with a seat belt. 
</P>
<P>
	The government would give automakers enough time to install the  
anchors in rear seats. It will take years for all child seats and 
cars to have the system, because it will be required only on new 
products. 
</P>
<P>
	Canada also will require the system, and Transport Canada is  
coordinating its announcement with the United States', government 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	With dozens of child seats on the market, parents have been  
frustrated by the difficulty of finding the right ones for their 
cars, which have a wide variety of seats and seat-belt designs. The 
Transportation Department says about 80 percent of child cars seats 
are not properly installed. 
</P>
<P>
	Properly restraining all children using child seats would save  
68 more lives each year, according to a National Highway Traffic 
Safety Administration estimate. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency has decided to make automakers install rigid metal  
bars behind the rear seats of new cars to serve as a universal 
anchor for child seats, according to government and industry 
officials and safety groups familiar with the plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Child seat manufacturers would have flexibility in designing  
attachments on new child seats that would hook onto the anchoring 
system, officials said. That would allow for cheaper systems, such 
as traditional seat-belt webbing attached to the child seat bottom 
on either side that would attach to the anchors with hooks, the 
safety groups said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, there could be more expensive options such as rigid  
rods on the child seat to snap onto the quarter-inch-thick metal 
bars. 
</P>
<P>
	A tether strap would secure the top of a forward-facing child  
seat near the child's head to another pin on the vehicle's rear 
package shelf, transportation officials said. The tether is 
intended to prevent head and neck injuries by keeping a child's 
head from moving too far forward in an accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost two years ago, President Clinton announced the proposed  
uniform child seat. Since then, the design of the seat anchorage 
has changed, in part to try to ensure automakers could use the same 
anchor system in vehicles sold in other countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Child seats now cost from $40 to $220, safety experts say. The  
agency, in a study last year, had estimated a new, universal 
latching system would add $10 to $65 to those costs.
