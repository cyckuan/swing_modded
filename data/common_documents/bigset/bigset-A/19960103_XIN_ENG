<HEADLINE> Irish Foreign Minister to Visit Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Irish Foreign Minister Dick
Spring will visit island this month for talks with Cyprus leaders
on the Cyprus problem, it was announced here today.
</P>
<P>
During his stay, Spring will cross into the Turkish-controlled
northern part of the divided capital of Nicosia to meet with
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash.
</P>
<P>
He is also expected to see U.N. Secretary-General's resident
representative Gustave Feissel. Ireland participates in the
U.N. Peace-Keeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP).
</P>
<P>
The Irish minister was to visit Cyprus in November 1995 but he
postponed the visit due to developments in the Northern Ireland
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts here consider Spring's visit to Cyprus very
important for developments in the Cyprus problem and the island's
bid to become a full member of the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
Ireland takes over the EU six-month rotating presidency on
July 1, 1996, and Spring will preside over the EU Council of
Ministers until the end of the year, a period described as very
important for Cyprus' course toward full EU membership.
</P>
<P>
The EU Council of Ministers has given a firm date for the
start of membership talks with Cyprus, six months after the EU
Intergovernmental Conference scheduled to begin later this year.
</P>
<P>
The political analysts noted that Spring's visit will take
place in the light of the new U.S. initiative on Cyprus, expected
to take a new boost with the scheduled visit to Cyprus on January
22 of U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for European and Canadian
Affairs Richard Holbrooke.
</P>
<P>
Press reports here suggested in the past that Spring was
coming to Cyprus at the encouragement of Holbrooke, who promised
"to make 1996 the year of the big push on Cyprus."
</P>
<P>
In a statement to the press on November 23, 1995, when
Spring's visit was first announced, Cyprus government spokesman
Yiannakis Cassoulides said that the Irish minister's visit was
"part of his initiative to convey his experience arising from the
Irish problem."

declared.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Israeli Minister: Peres-Assad Summit Essential for Peace with Syria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Minister in the prime
minister's office Yossi Beilin said here today that a summit
meeting between Syrian President Hafez al-Assad and Israeli Prime
Minister Shimon Peres is essential for the peace process between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
During an interview with Israel Radio, Beilin, who holds
special responsibility for the peace process in the Israeli
government, said that a summit meeting is very important for the
success of the Israeli-Syrian peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
"If we do not have a summit meeting," he said, "I am afraid it
will take more time to reach an agreement."
</P>
<P>
Beilin said that Israel is still waiting for a clear answer
from the Syrian side about the normalization and the security
arrangements.
</P>
<P>
"If we can get the answer soon, there may be a quick
breakthrough in the negotiations," he added.
</P>
<P>
Beilin is due to meet this evening with a group of settlers
from the Golan Heights who say they are prepared to leave the
Golan Heights if there will be a real peace with the Syrians.
</P>
<P>
He refused to answer whether he will encourage this group of
settlers to expand their campaign on behalf of the government,
and only said it was important to inform them with the latest
developments in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Israeli and Syrian negotiation teams started
their second round of peace talks in the U.S. today after the
long New Year weekend.
</P>
<P>
The two sides resumed the peace negotiations on December 27 at
the Wye River Conference Center near Washington and the first
three days of talks ended last Friday.

LUSAKA, January 3 (Xinhua) -- The Cooperative Bank of Zambia
which closed in November last year will re-open to the public
within the shortest possible time, it is announced here today.
</P>
<P>
The bank's Managing Director Mainza Nchimunya said in a

The board has also appointed a management committee to look

</P>
<P>
He explained that the bank was closed to the public in
November to avoid a run on it following the closures of two
commercial banks in Zambia.
</P>
<P>
The decision to temporarily close the bank was also influenced
by adverse press coverage regarding the country's financial
market, he added.

LUSAKA, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's ruling party chief
today urged the youths in markets and residential areas to
conduct door-to- door campaign to get more people registered as
voters before the exercise ends.
</P>
<P>
National Secretary of the ruling Movement for Multi-party
Democracy (MMD) Michael Sata made the call at a mass rally in
Lusaka's downtown area.
</P>
<P>
Sata appealed to the people to register as voters because good
governance can only come through their ballot papers.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he directed the youths not to use force when mobilizing
people for voters registration.
</P>
<P>
Turning away these people who have not registered as voters
from markets and bus stops will not help the registration process
as it will only deny them democracy, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The voters registration exercise has been marred by the people's
apathy since it began three weeks ago. In most areas, less than 20
percent of the eligible voters have registered.

<HEADLINE> Israel not to Compensate Palestinians for Intifada Damages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Israel today decided not to
bear responsibility for the damages caused by Israeli security
forces to the Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip during
the intifada (Palestinian uprising) starting in 1987.
</P>
<P>
The decision was taken at a cabinet meeting chaired by Prime
Minister Shimon Peres after the Palestinians raised the issue
recently.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet argued that there had also been damages to
Israelis during that period.
</P>
<P>
The decision means that the Palestinians cannot claim
compensation from Israel.
</P>
<P>
However, the meeting decide to set up a committee to look into
exceptional cases of innocent Palestinians suffering damages.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Peres said that there was no reason for Israel to be
responsible for the damages to the Palestinians since they stemmed
from what were essentially acts of war against Israel by the
Palestinians during the intifada.
</P>
<P>
The intifada-related damage suits now pending in the courts
are estimated to hundreds of millions of U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Peres said that just as Israel paid all damages to Jewish
victims of the intifada, the Palestinian National Authority
should take care of claims by the Palestinians since it is them
who were responsible for the "mini-war."
</P>
<P>
However, Israeli Attorney-General Michael Ben-Yair rejected
Peres' stand.
</P>
<P>
Ben-Yair's position is that since Israel has controlled the
occupied territories for almost three decades, it cannot claim it
is not responsible for what happened there. It also cannot
retroactively deny the plaintiffs' right to sue, he said.
</P>
<P>
His idea is to take the suits out of the courts and set up a
compensation committee which would examine each case and
compensate any innocent victim.
</P>
<P>
Those who suffered damages because they were directly involved
in intifada activity would obviously not be compensated, he
added.

<HEADLINE> Iran Sets Priority in Foreign Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Ali
Akbar Velayati said today the priorities of his country's foreign
policy are to fight back the international isolation of Tehran
intended by Washington.
</P>
<P>
Velayati said at a press conference that the first priority of
Iran is to promote its relations with its 15 neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Iran enjoys friendly relations with Pakistan, Russia,
Afghanistan and Turkmenistan. There have been tensions in its
relations with all other neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Iran fought an eight-year war against its western neighbor of
Iraq. But Tehran's most serious regional problem now is with the
United Arab Emirates (UAE) over three disputed islands in the
Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
The islands of Abu Musa, Lesser and Greater Tonbs are situated
near the strategic strait of Hormuz through which two thirds of
the world's oil reaches the international markets.
</P>
<P>
Velayati added that the second priority is to develop relations
with industrial countries which "have not had any disagreements"
with Iran.
</P>
<P>
Iran strives to have relations with Europe, Russia, China,
Japan, Southeast Asian, South Asian and Moslem countries and real
Non-Aligned countries, he added.
</P>
<P>
Comparing Europe and the U.S., Velayati said that the
Europeans have had a more mature approach to Iran.
</P>
<P>
"The Europeans understand Iran much better than Americans. The
Europeans have committed fewer mistakes with regard to Iran. What
the Americans are doing is influenced by the wrong analyses given
to them by the Zionists," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said the Americans were in the wrong about the Islamic
Revolution even before its victory in 1979. In comparison, the
French understood the importance of the revolution by allowing
the architect of the Islamic Revolution, Ayatollah Rouhollah
Khomeini, to reside in Paris after he was expelled from Iraq in
1978, he added.
</P>
<P>
He added that Iran attached great importance to the role played
by Russia in the Caucasus and Central Asia.
</P>
<P>
At the end of last week's visit here by Russian Vice-Premier
Oleg Davydev, it was announced that Iranian and Russian presidents
are to meet in the near future to sign commercial and military
agreements.
</P>
<P>
The contracts will define the course of cooperation between
the two countries for the next decade.
</P>
<P>
However, the Iranian foreign minister said that the two sides
have not yet fixed a specific date for Russian President Boris
Yeltsin to visit Tehran.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, January 3 (Xinhua) -- No breakthrough is expected to
be secured during the second round of Maryland talks between Syria
and Israel, according to diplomatic sources here.
</P>
<P>
They added that hopes are pinned on U.S. Secretary of State
Warren Christopher's coming Middle East tour due to start on
January 10.
</P>
<P>
The second round of talks between Syria and Israel in a villa
in Maryland State, the United States will start today amidst a
positive atmosphere suggesting the possibility of securing some
progress and deal with all aspects of a political settlement
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Syrian newspapers today called on Israeli leaders to adopt
practical attitudes and translate them into a reality, with the
aim of freeing the Middle East from tension, wars and conflict.
</P>
<P>
Christopher's tour is due to work out a program for the
normalization of Syrian-Israeli relations and a timetable for an
Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights
</P>
<P>
The sources added that despite the positive atmosphere
pervading the Maryland talks between Syria and Israel, there is
still a wide gap between the attitudes of the two countries
regarding a number of questions, especially the question of the
Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights captured in the 1967
Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
Syria has insisted on Israel's complete withdrawal from the
heights in exchange for a peace agreement. While Israel said the
depth of withdrawal will depend on the quality of the peace that
Syria offers in return.
</P>
<P>
Israel insists on setting up ground-based early warning
stations in the Golan Heights after an Israeli pull-out. However,
Syria views this as an infringement of its sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Christopher is expected to make some proposals aimed at
bringing the attitudes of the two parties closer and hammering
out a joint declaration of principles before the coming Israeli
Parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
Reliable Syrian sources in Damascus said today that the
Syrian side is desirous of peace, and the American sponsor
of the peace negotiations has to persuade the Israeli side to
accept peace on the basis of the Madrid conference principles and
relevant U.N. Security Council resolutions.

<HEADLINE> London Stock Exchange Issues New Guidelines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 3 (Xinhua) -- The London Stock Exchange on
Tuesday issued new guidelines for industry regulators on the
control of information which could affect the share prices of
companies under their supervision.
</P>
<P>
Regulators have agreed to reduce to a minimum -- normally no
more than 24 hours -- the period between giving sensitive
information to a company and its advisers and releasing it
publicly.
</P>
<P>
They have also agreed to make sure information is passed only
to people who "need to know".
</P>
<P>
The need for clearer rules was highlighted last summer when a
row broke out over the leak of information about price controls
planned by Stephen Littlechild, director general of the Office of
Electricity Regulation, on regional electricity companies.
</P>
<P>
Besides electricity, the agreement covers regulators for
aviation, the environment, gaming, television, gas, lottery, rail,
telecommunications and water.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Exports Soybeans To South Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean farmers are espected
to earn 5.1 million U.S. dollars from its export of 20,000 tons
of soybeans to South Africa in the new year.
</P>
<P>
"Our request for export permits has been approved by the
Ministry of Agriculture. This deal is a major boost to local
farmers," said George Hutchinson, chairman of the Zimbabwean
Commercial Seeds Producers Association here today.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Commercial Bank of Zimbabwe said the approval
was "a great incentive" for soybean producers to increase output
and earn foreign currency.
</P>
<P>
South Africa is the major regional market for soybeans, with
demand estimated at 250,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean farmers had also received enquiries from three
other Southern African countries including Zambia, Malawi and
Botswana.
</P>
<P>
Local soybean production in Zimbabwe during the 1995/96 season
was expected to have exceeded 120,000 tons.

<HEADLINE> ADR Trading Volumes Hit Record Highs in 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 3 (Xinhua) -- In a year of soaring U.S. stock
market, the trading volumes for American Depositary Receipts
(ADRs) hit record highs in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The total number of ADR shares traded on U.S. stock exchanges
during 1995 jumped to 10 billion u.s. dollars, an increase of 38
percent over the previous year. The dollar value of these trading
volumes reached 278 billion U.S. dollars, 12 percent more than
1994, according to a Citibank report available here today.
</P>
<P>
ADRs are U.S. securities that represent shares of a non-U.S.
company and trade in the U.S. financial markets similar to the
way ordinary shares of U.S. companies do.
</P>
<P>
At the end of 1995, there were 1,549 depositary receipt
programs, 636 representing issuers in Asia/Pacific; 583 in Europe;
208 in Latin America and 122 in Africa.
</P>
<P>
New ADR offerings by companies outside the U.S. remained below
1994's record levels, primarily due to widespread price declines
in foreign company shares. A total of 192 companies from 44
countries and regions had launched new programs. The number of
companies from Europe increased while that from Latin America and
Asia fell from 1994.
</P>
<P>
Of the companies launching new depositary receipt programs in
1995, 96 used them to raise 11.5 billion dollars in new capital.
Some 64 percent of the capital raised came out of Europe, 29
percent from Asia, and the rest from Latin America and Africa.
</P>
<P>
Sandra Jaffee, Citibank's division executive for Worldwide
Securities Services, said that U.S. investor demand for foreign
stocks has been growing in recent years and the trend is expected
to continue.
</P>
<P>
U.S. investment in international securities grew from 17
billion dollars in 1981 to 307 billion dollars in 1994. Some
analysts expect the figure to reach 1 trillion by the end of the
century.
</P>
<P>
Citibank, which serves over 500 depositary receipt programs
worldwide, began offering depositary receipt services to clients
in 1928 and has been a market leader in recent years.

LONDON, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Opposition Labour Party
warned today that it would restore the rail network to the public
sector if the Conservative government sells off the railway.
</P>
<P>

He stressed that nobody should be in any doubt about Labour's
commitment to retaining the railway infrastructure in public
ownership and with full public accountability.

services have been split into 25 companies with the first three

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Swazi police made a baton
charge on about 300 street vendors who staged a protest in
central Mbabane Tuesday, the South African Press Association
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The protesting vendors, who are members of the Swaziland
Federation of Trade Unions, had been barred from trading at the
central taxi rank or from street pavements of the capital of
Swaziland.
</P>
<P>
The police moved in and used teargas and batons when the
vendors refused to disperse. About dozens of vendors sustained
minor injuries in the police baton charge.
</P>
<P>
The vendors later handed a memorandum to the Ministry of
Housing and Urban Development requesting the order barring them
from trading be suspended pending an appeal against the measure.
</P>
<P>
However, Housing and Urban Development Minister John
Carmichael said he would make a response to the vendors' demand
later today.
</P>
<P>
Swaziland is a small land-locked country surrounded by South
Africa and Mozambique with a population of less than a million.

<P>
LONDON, January 3 (Xinhua) -- All European Union (EU) citizens
should be issued with "personal skills cards" detailing their
knowledge and formal qualifications, according to an EU White
Paper on education.
</P>
<P>
The cards, which would be updated regularly, would be
recognized for training and employment purposes throughout the EU,
local media quoted the White Paper as saying today.
</P>
<P>
Abilities such as writing skills, word-processing and language
proficiency would be detailed on the skills cards, it said.
</P>
<P>
Such a scheme would provide an immediate assessment of a
person's qualifications during their life in comparison with
diplomas which lose their value with time at an ever-increasing
pace.
</P>
<P>
The White Paper also proposes to increase student mobility by
ensuring that students who get a study grant in their own country
can use it in any other EU country.

<HEADLINE> Russia's Foreign Trade Expected to Rise in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Russia's foreign trade volume is
expected to total 102 to 105 billion U.S. dollars in 1996, 5 to 8
percent higher than the anticipated figure for 1995, the Russian
Economic Ministry said here today.
</P>
<P>
The growth will be due to increasing business activities on
world markets and price hikes on many Russian exporting items,
including oil, petroproducts, gas, iron and steel as well as
timber, the ministry said in a release.
</P>
<P>
But the ministry noted that the growth of Russian export will
somewhat decelerate this year, citing low potentials in
export-oriented industries and higher production costs as the main
factors.
</P>
<P>
The total volume of imported goods and services is estimated
to be 38 to 40 billion dollars in 1996, 10 to 15 percent higher
than that of last year.
</P>
<P>
The share of machine-tools and equipment in imports will rise
by 44 to 45 percent to reach 16.8 to 17.9 billion dollars,
signaling an investment growth, noted the ministry.

HONG KONG, January 3 (Xinhua) -- The absence of its back-bone
players and an injured star forward seem not to bother too much of
 Xu Genbao, coach of the visiting Shanghai Shenhua soccer team for
the 10th Shanghai-Hong Kong Cup tournament here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The three Russian players on the team are vacationing back
home. And the four national Olympic side members are with the
national team in a pre-Olympic training camp in Kunming,
southwest China, for the soccer tournament this summer in the
Atlanta Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
And what is more, Fan Zhiyi, China's newly-crowned Mr. Football
and winner of the golden boot prize last year, was injured Monday
when the Shanghai team lost an international to the French side of
Cannes back on home turf.
</P>
<P>
Although taking a cautious tone, Xu was obviously confident of
defending the trophy his side won last year in Shanghai. "I know
we are to play with quite a few guys absent from the line-up, but
I think things will go our way once we get in there," he said.
</P>
<P>
Koo Luam Hung, coach of the Hong Kong team, has been under fire
since his side lost 0-4 to the Guangdong team in the first leg of
the annual Guangdong-Hong Kong Cup tournament here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"I just hope Yau Kin Wai, the injured defender who didn't play
Sunday, will be available tomorrow, so as to improve our defense,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"But the Shanghai team is all the more stronger than my side,"
he admitted.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai and Hong Kong take turns hosting the annual interport
event. Shanghai has won five out of the nine previous
tournaments.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, january 3 (Xinhua) -- Swaziland's road safety
campaign has succeeded in reducing the number of accidents, said
a police report released in the Swazi capital of Mbabane today.
</P>
<P>
The South African press association quoted police spokesman
Khisimusi Ndlovu as saying the number of accidents on Swaziland
roads during the year-long campaign have dropped by 64 percent.
</P>
<P>
The annual report attributed the decline of road accidents to
the fact that the public behaved responsibly, especially by
heeding warnings not to drink and drive.
</P>
<P>
However, the police report did not give the details of the
road accidents and the death toll resulted from the accidents.
</P>
<P>
Although the police report said there was also a slight drop
in crime levels, Swazi police issued a warning over the arrival
in the country of a relatively new phenomenon, vehicle
hijackings.
</P>
<P>
Eleven cars had been stolen in Swaziland since the New Year's
Eve.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the police warned motorists finding themselves held
up at gun point not to panic or resist but to obey the hijackers.
</P>
<P>

TOKYO, January 3 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese city of Nagasaki has
decided to exhibit materials on Japan's history of invasion and
aggression in Asia in its atomic bombing museum to be opened in
April, the Asahi Shimbun reported today.
</P>
<P>
The municipal government believes that it is important for
Japan to look at the reality of World War II both as the
aggrieved and aggriever while calling for a complete abolition of
nuclear weapons, the mass-circulation daily said.
</P>
<P>
"We must face up to Japan's history of invasion and aggression
in Asia and Pacific and conduct a rigorous reflection on it,"
Nagasaki Mayor Iccho Ito was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Without this reflection and apologies to the countries of
Asia, our appeals for the abolition of nuclear weapons will not
reach the hearts of the world's people," he added.
</P>
<P>
The planned atomic bomb exhibit will consist of two parts --
Japan as the aggriever and Japan as the aggrieved, the newspaper
said.
</P>
<P>
Materials such as maps, photos and films will be on display to
tell people about Japan's wartime atrocities since 1930 when Japan
started the war of aggression in Asia, including the Nanjing
Massacre, vivisections by Japan's Army Unit 731 in China, forced
labor and forced sex, according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
Nagasaki was A-bombed just three days after the world's first
atomic bomb flattened Hiroshima in 1945.

<HEADLINE> Comesa to Respect Zimbabwe's Option </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 3 (Xinhua) -- The Common Market for Eastern
and Southern Africa (comesa) said today that it will respect
whatever position zimbabwe takes regarding ratification of the
organization's treaty.
</P>
<P>
Comesa Secretary General Bingu Wa Mutharika told the
Zimbabwean National News Agency from Lusaka that his organization
would never force sovereign states to sign or ratify its treaty.
</P>
<P>
"Zimbabwe is a sovereign state. We respect whatever decision
it takes," he said.
</P>
<P>
His remarks came in the wake of reports by Zimbabwean
President Robert Mugabe that his government leaned strongly
toward the 12-member Southern African Development Community
(sadc) with an option to invite Kenya and Uganda to join the
group.
</P>
<P>
In an interview published last week, Mugabe said the nature of
comesa made it difficult to operate while there were vast
advantages of viable sadc.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the two regional organizations have
generally created heated debate with some regarding comesa as a
circus because of its huge membership.
</P>
<P>
Comesa, formed in 1993, is a transformation of the now defunct
Preferential Trade Area for Eastern and Southern Africa, while
sadc succeeded the then Southern African Development Coordination
Conference in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Wa Mutharika said 20 countries had signed comesa but only 13
had ratified its treaty.
</P>
<P>
"We are all eagerly waiting for a conference to resolve the
dual membership in sadc and comesa to be held some time this
year," he said.

<P>
LONDON, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Ulster Unionist Party, the
largest Protestant political party in Northern Ireland, urged the
British government today to abandon peace talks with Sinn Fein
until the Irish Republic Army stops its murder campaign against
"drug dealers".
</P>
<P>
UUP deputy leader John Taylor told BBC radio that the IRA had
to understand that they could not kill or bomb their way to a
negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
A group in Northern Ireland calling itself Direct Action
Against Drugs have claimed five murders since last December.
Police in the province believed that this is the cover name used
by the IRA to have carried out these killings.
</P>
<P>
Taylor said that the British government should be as firm as
the Irish government which scrapped plans to release IRA prisoners
before Christmas.
</P>
<P>
However, the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP), the
largest Catholic political party in Ulster, strongly opposed the
UUP's suggestion.
</P>
<P>
A senior member of the SDLP Mark Durkan argued that violence
from "any quarter" should not be allowed to veto dialogue in the
current peace process in Northern Ireland.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Delivers Year-end Report on Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
today delivered his year-end report to the nation predicting a
seven percent growth rate for the gross national product (GNP) in
1996.
</P>
<P>
Speaking before members of the cabinet, parliamentarians and
other government officials, the president said that the
Philippines' GNP growth for 1995 was about six percent, compared
with 2.6 percent in 1992, when he became president of the country.
</P>
<P>
He said that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) recently
removed the Philippines from its list of "poor countries" since
the Philippines' per capita income increased from 770 US dollars
in 1992 to 960 US dollars in 1995, well surpassing the level of
860 US dollars set by the IMF.
</P>
<P>
The president declared that this means the Philippines is on
the right track.
</P>
<P>
On the peace reforms which the government has initiated, Ramos
reported that significant gains were achieved particularly with
military rebels and Muslim secessionists.
</P>
<P>
He declared that the pro-poor programs under the social reform
agenda of the government have succeeded in reducing the poverty
incidence from 39.2 percent in 1991 to 35.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
In his 30-minute speech, the president said the government has
made a significant step in improving the financial accessibility
to small and medium-sized enterprises.
</P>
<P>
From July 1992 to mid-1995, he said, small and medium-sized
enterprises received a total of 57 billion pesos (2.3 billion US
dollars) in loans compared to 16 billion pesos (600 million
dollars) from 1946 to 1992.
</P>
<P>
He also unveiled 10 major programs that must be achieved in
1996 in order to sustain the economic momentum in the country. The
comprehensive tax reform and other policy reforms must be
undertaken because it is the cornerstone of the country's economic
reform, he said.
</P>
<P>
The other programs include reforms regarding the judicial
system, anti-criminality and anti-terrorism, the upgrading of
infrastructure, bureaucracy, modernization of the armed forces and
police, food security insurance, preservation of the environment
and partnership with the international community.
</P>
<P>
Ramos also urged his fellow countrymen to unite and "work as a
national team" to face the challenges ahead.

NEW DELHI, January 3 (Xinhua) -- An all party meeting convened
by Karnataka Chief Minister H.D. Deve Gowda on the Cauvery water
issue decided to release six thousand million cubic (TMC) feet of
water to neighboring state of Tamil Nadu, the Press Trust of India
reported.
</P>
<P>
A resolution passed at the meeting said water would be released
in deference to the directive of Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao
and in the interests of inter-state harmony and cordiality.

farmers in the Cauvery Basin.
</P>

The decision came after two days of intensive consultations
among leaders of the Karnataka state on Rao's directive, which was
announced Monday demanding that Karnataka should release
immediately six TMC feet of water to save the standing crops in
Tamil Nadu.
</P>
<P>
Tamil Nadu had requested the release of 11 TMC feet of Cauvery

<HEADLINE> Sarajevo Serbs Free Three Muslims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE January 3 (Xinhua) -- Sarajevo Serbs today freed three
Muslims they detained Tuesday, said French IFOR officers there.
</P>
<P>
According to BBC TV news, the three Muslims, all women, were
held by the Serbs Tuesday for straying into their sector of the
city, the Serb-held Ilidza, Sarajevo's western suburb.
</P>
<P>
The Bosnian Muslim government has claimed that 16 more Muslims
were abducted by the Serbs last week and urged the NATO-led
Implementation Force (IFOR) to press for the release of the
detainees.
</P>
<P>
"This is a serious violation of the Dayton peace agreement. It
is an attempt...to undermine the peace process, especially the
integration of Sarajevo," Bosnian Foreign Minister Muhamed
Sarcebey said.
</P>
<P>
Despite criticisms from the Muslim government for inaction, the
IFOR commanders said the abduction of civilians was a small
incident which should be dealt with by the civilian police force.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a Bosnian Serb spokesman has confirmed that 12
Muslims, including soldiers and security officers, were taken
under custody for questioning because they were considered
prisoners of war.
</P>
<P>
The mayor of Ilidza is expected to meet with NATO commanders
today to discuss the issue, reports from Sarajevo said.

<HEADLINE> Iran Reveals Difference with Syria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar
Velayati today revealed for the first time that there were
differences of opinions on some issues between Iran and its
strategic ally Syria.
</P>
<P>
Velayati told a press conference here that despite the
friendship between Syria and Iran, the stands held by the two
countries were not always the same.
</P>
<P>
Asked if there would be any problems in the relations between
the two countries as Syria is ready to sign a peace deal with
Israel, Velayati responded that it would be in the interest of
both sides to resolve their differences.
</P>
<P>
However, Velayati said in mid-December that existing warm
relations between Iran and Syria might go sour as Damascus is
preparing to ink a peace treaty with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that the statement by the Iranian foreign
minister indicates that the Iranian government takes one step
backward from its previous position toward the Middle East peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Iran had said earlier that it will still maintain good
relations with Syria even if Syria reaches peace agreement with
Israel.
</P>
<P>
At today's press conference, Velayati said, the Syrians shared
with Iranians the same support for Hezbollah, the Islamic
resistance movement in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
He said that the two countries were still cooperating on
regional issue. He was referring to the recent trilateral meeting
between Iran, Turkey and Syrian on the Kurdish issue in northern
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iranians are getting seriously embarrassed and angry as their
ally Syrians "were sitting, eating and living together with
Israelis" in a Maryland villa in the U.S. in late December.
</P>
<P>
In a response, the visits to Damascus by Velayati and Iranian
First Vice-President Hassan Habibi have been indefinitely
postponed because of the peace talks between Syria and Israel and
Syria's support for the United Arab Emirates' claim against Iran
regarding the ownership of the three disputed islands in the
Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
On December 31, Ahmad al-Hassan, Syrian Ambassador to Tehran,
conveyed a verbal message of Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq al-
Shara to the Iranian government, stressing the importance of
Tehran-Damascus relations.
</P>
<P>
Al-Shara pledged that Syria will never relinquish its
friendship with Iran and will not give opportunity to those who
want to strain Tehran-Damascus relations.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believe that the new rift between Iran and Syria
will widen after the Syrians sign the agreement with Israel.
</P>
<P>
"This is only the beginning of the end for the strategic
Tehran-Damascus relations. The tension between the two countries
will reach its highest point when the Syrians take action to
disarm the pro-Iranian Hezbollah in south Lebanon," a source at
Iran's Foreign Ministry told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said, "If Syria is to sign the peace deal with
Israel, Iran will be much more isolated than it was before, like
Iraq, Sudan and Libya."
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the Tehran government has to face the reality of
the Middle East peace process though Iran has been kept away from
it for a long time.

<HEADLINE> Organization Moves to Protect Yangtze River Source </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 3 (Xinhua) -- A meeting was held here recently
to mark the start of China's first major non-governmental move to
protect the source of the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
Yang Xin, an explorer and sponsor of the activity, has visited
the source of the river five times over the past decade. According
to his plan, there will be explorations in the source area over
the next five years, nature reserves will be built, and efforts
will be made to increase public awareness of the ecology in the
area.
</P>
<P>
The government plans to give full support to the activity, Xie
Zhenhua, director of the State Bureau for Environmental
Protection, said at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Yangtze, the third longest river in the world and the
longest in China, is 6,300 km in length and covers an area of 1.8
million sq km.
</P>
<P>
According to scientists from the Chinese Academy of Sciences,
the source area, which is between the Kunlun and Tanggula
mountains, covers 140,000 sq km and is in the middle of the
Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Because of the high elevation, thin air,
and cold weather, the ecology in the area is very fragile.
</P>
<P>
Recent scientific studies have shown that environmental
prospects in the source area are not optimistic. Uncontrolled
killing of wildlife has resulted in the sharp decrease in their
numbers, and a serious plague of mice and unrestricted herds have
led to depletion of the grassland.
</P>
<P>
Scientists pointed out that the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is
considered the third polar area of the globe and has an important
influence on the global climate. The source region has an
influence not only on the plateau but also the entire Yangtze
River area. The protection of the area is of great significance,
they said.

by an expert of the Iranian National Security Council, Ali Agha
Mohammadi, with Iraqi rebel Kurds in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
An Iraqi Foreign Ministry spokesman was quoted today by the
Iraqi News Agency as saying that Iraq considered such action as a
flagrant violation of Iraq's sovereignty and an interference in
its internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian behavior expressed the double standard policy
pursued by the Iranian government, he added.
</P>
<P>
He warned the Iranian government against maintaining such
action which contradicts all principles of self-respect among
nations and non-intervention in the internal affairs of any
country.
</P>
<P>
An Iranian delegation arrived in northern Iraq Saturday for
talks with heads of Iraqi Kurdish parties and groups in an effort
to find ways to end fighting there.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati said in
Tehran today the sending of a delegation was not intended as "an
action against the government of Iraq."
</P>
<P>
The Iranian minister defended his country's position by saying
that "continuation of fighting among the Kurdish groups in
northern Iraq is a threat to Iran which shares a long border with
the Iraqi Kurdistan."

<HEADLINE> Hainan Must Come Up With New Advantages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Hainan must create new advantages
to increase competitiveness in domestic and international markets,
Chinese Vice-premier Qian Qichen said during an inspection tour of
this south-China province and largest special economic zone.
</P>
<P>
Qian said that Hainan has seen big development in the last few
years, even though it had a poor past and was late in getting
started. He reiterated that the central government's policy of
"three no changes" towards special economic zones still stands, as
was stated by President Jiang Zemin in a recent inspection tour of
the Shantou Special Economic Zone in neighboring Guangdong
province.
</P>
<P>
During his visit from December 31 to January 3, the
vice-premier attended the opening ceremony of the Year of Vacation
and Leisure in Sanya, and visited Haikou, Qionghai, Qiongshan,
Waning, Tongshi and other places in Hainan Province.
</P>
<P>
Qian pointed out that Hainan is a good place to develop
tropical farms, but that new efforts must be made in developing
tropical farm product processing.
</P>
<P>
Some countries have demonstrated that prosperity based on real
estate speculation cannot last, Qian said, noting that Hainan has
its own advantages in developing oil and gas refining, agriculture
and tourism.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of Hainan's tourism prospects, Qian said that Hainan
faces competition from surrounding countries and regions, and it
is essential for Hainan to have its own unique undertakings. While
modern traffic and telecommunications facilities and hotels are
being developed, the natural scenery in the island must be
preserved, the vice-premier stressed.
</P>
<P>
In addressing the question of customs managment, Qian told
local officials that they should mainly depend on advanced
technology and equipment to improve safety and efficiency, and
must pay attention to international practices.

<HEADLINE> New Strategy Helps Guizhou Farmers Escape Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Some 1.2 million poor farmers in
Guizhou, an economically underdeveloped region with scarce
farmland in southwest China, escaped poverty in 1995 thanks to a
new strategy that focused on growing economic crops and trees by
reclaiming waste land.
</P>
<P>
According to local officials, one out of nine of China's
population living in poverty live in Guizhou, 97 percent of which
is covered by karst land. The only Chinese province without any
plains, Guizhou has many parts that have been declared by Chinese
and foreign scholars to be unsuitable for human habitation.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, two-thirds of its 34 million people live in remote
mountains and karst areas. Burdened with harsh living conditions,
many of the local farmers have never stopped their forest
reclamation work, and they still suffer from hunger and their
environment had been damaged, making living conditions worse.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of the 1980s, when the Chinese government
started its poverty-relief program, Guizhou had developed a number
of measures, but the mountains, the large population, and the poor
transportation and communications made it difficult to make much
progress in poverty-relief work.
</P>
<P>
So, provincial leaders came up with an idea -- developing waste
land with a potential for growing economic crops and trees.
</P>
<P>
The move soon drew attention from China's top agricultural
experts who believe that the hilly land, though unsuitable for
grain, can be used to grow economic crops such as tobacco,
medicinal herbs, bamboo, and varieties of economic trees with fast
economic returns. Growing trees in the waste land can also improve
the ecology, an expert pointed out.
</P>
<P>
A provincial survey has shown that Guizhou has over four
million hectares of waste land, or more than its farmland
resources.
</P>
<P>
The new poverty-relief strategy started with converting
farmland with poor conditions to forest zones, and over the past
five years, 7.3 million hectares of waste land has been
afforestated, while over several hundred thousand hectares of
economic trees or shrubs such as fruit, coconuts, tea, and
medicinal herbs have been developed, a provincial official said.
</P>
<P>
Wuhua Village, in Rongjiang County, used to be one of the
poorest areas in China, with many peasants lacking adequate
bedding or clothing to deal with the harsh winter. With the new
idea of converting vast waste land resources to economic tree
growing areas, however, all the local people have been given a
chance to move to new houses and the village not only has adequate
food and clothing, but has built a television relay station as
well.
</P>
<P>
After inspecting the new poverty-work in Guizhou, Tong Dalin, a
famous Chinese economist, spoke highly of the new ways, saying
that the move has expanded the living space for local farmers, and
has helped poverty-stricken people in developing a commodity
economy.
</P>
<P>
"With the development of waste land resources, ecological
construction, the market penetration rate and industralization
will be accelerated, facilitating local people's escape from
poverty," he said.

<HEADLINE> Tehran Rejects Baghdad's Protest over Northern Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 3 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian government today
rejected Baghdad's protest over the presence of an Iranian
delegation in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati defended Iran's position by
saying that "continuation of fighting among the Kurdish groups in
northern Iraq is a threat to Iran which shares a long border with
the Iraqi Kurdistan."
</P>
<P>
"Because we have a long border with Kurdish area of the
northern part of Iraq, we cannot remain indifferent. So, if there
are some internal conflicts, we have to try to solve them," he
said at a press conference here today.
</P>
<P>
Velayati said Iran has initiated mediation efforts by sending
a delegation to Iraqi Kurdistan in order to bring about peace
among the warring factions.
</P>
<P>
"Different governments have tried to mediate between these
factions. But none of them have been as successful as Iran," he
claimed.
</P>
<P>
Velayati said the sending of delegation was not intended as "an
action against the government of Iraq."
</P>
<P>
Baghdad has objected to the dispatch of the delegation to
northern Iraq, calling it interference in the internal affairs of
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian delegation arrived in the Iraqi Kurdistan Saturday
for talks with heads of Iraqi Kurdish Parties and groups to find
ways to end fighting and bloodshed in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Ali Aqa-Mohammadi, head of the Iranian delegation, said Tuesday
that Iran's efforts to establish peace and tranquility in
northern Iraq will continue.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted, the first priority is to remove the present
problems and obstacles.
</P>
<P>
During the 45-minute press conference, Velayati added that "if
the central government of Iraq could control these problems, we
would not intervene. But we know that there is no control by the
Iraqi government over the Kurdish area."
</P>
<P>
According to an Iranian official report, Kurdistan Democratic
Party (KDP) chief Masoud Barzani said the outcome of his talks
with an Iranian delegation was positive.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Tehran's mediation in the talks between the
Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) and the KDP, he said, "Iran
has played an effective role in the past and can play a crucial
role in the future."
</P>
<P>
As for the talks to be held in Amman by the Iraq groups opposed
to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, Barzani said he would not
participate in the meeting although he received an invitation
from King Hussein of Jordan.
</P>
<P>
"Before we participate in talks, the role of each group in
post-Saddam Iraq should be cleared," he said.

<HEADLINE> Emerson to Set up Three Joint Ventures in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 3 (Xinhua) -- The Emerson Electric Co. of the
United States will set up three joint ventures in China this year,
according to Charles F. Knight, Emerson's chairman and CEO, who
made the announcement here today.
</P>
<P>
Emerson is a major manufacturer of electrical, electronic, and
other systems for commercial, industrial, and consumer markets,
with sales in the Asia-Pacific Region last year totalling one
billion US dollars, and 1.8 billion when joint ventures are
included.
</P>
<P>
The three new joint ventures are the Rosemount Far East
Instrument Co., Ltd. here, the Copeland Compressors Company
Ltd. in Shenyang, capital of northeast China's Liaoning Province,
and Zhejiang Emerson Motor Co. in Huzhou City, in east China's
Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
Rosemount was co-operatively set up by Emerson's wholly owned
subsidiary, Rosemount Inc., and the Beijing Far East Instrument
Co., Ltd. and will begin business this coming April to produce
pressure and temperature transmitters for the oil, gas,
petrochemical, and power industries in the Asia-Pacific Region,
focusing on China's market.
</P>
<P>
Shenyang's Copeland, a joint venture between Emerson's Copeland
Corporation and the local No. 1 Refrigerating Machine Works, is
expected to produce semi-hermetic compressors and condensing units
for China's refrigeration and air-conditioning markets this year.
</P>
<P>
Zhejiang Emerson is also expected to go operational this month
near Shanghai, a joint effort of Emerson Motor Co. and a local
motor co., in Huzhou, for manufacturing fractional horsepower
motors for the appliance and air-conditioning markets in China.
</P>
<P>
"China is an important market for Emerson, the formation of
these three joint ventures will play key roles in promoting
Emerson's business in China, and even in the Asia-Pacific Region,"
Knight noted.

<HEADLINE> NATO Commander Assures Sarajevo Serbs Safety </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, January 3 (Xinhua) -- NATO Commander for Bosnia
Admiral Leighton Smith has urged Sarajevo Serbs to stay where they
are and trust the multinational Implementation Force (IFOR) troops
who will guarantee the safety of all citizens in Bosnia, Tanjug
news agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Bosnian Serb TV in Pale late Tuesday,
Smith said the aim of the IFOR troops "is to provide citizens
throughout the country with a feeling of safety."
</P>
<P>
The deployment of thousands of troops around Sarajevo will
convince the Serbs that they have no reason to leave their homes
in the parts of the city which will be handed over to the
Muslim-Croat federation, the U.S. commander added.
</P>
<P>
Under the Bosnia peace agreement, five Serb-held Sarajevo
districts will be reverted to the control of the Muslim government.
</P>
<P>
The 140,000 Serbs in these sectors are opposed to the hand-over
for fear of retaliation and discrimination by their former
enemies. Some of them have already packed up and fled to other
Serb territories, while many more are ready to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
"Give us a chance, remain in your homes, and do not take part
in a mass exodus that I have been told could take place," Smith
urged the Serbs in Sarajevo through the TV.
</P>
<P>
Last weekend, Smith turned down a request from a Serb leader to
delay for nine months the transfer of Serb-held Sarajevo sectors
to the government rule.
</P>
<P>
He told the Serb parliament speaker, Momcilo Krajisnik who
reportedly made the request, in a letter that he was "not
authorized to change the timing of the transfer of land under the
peace agreement."

<HEADLINE> US Pressure on Iran Comes from Internal Power Struggle: Iranian FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 3 (Xinhua) -- The Americans' latest intensified
pressure on Iran was the outcome of the pre-election rivalry
between the Republicans and the Democrats, the Iranian foreign
minister said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference with foreign reporters stationed
in Tehran, Ali Akbar Velayati criticized the U.S. President Bill
Clinton for saying one thing and doing something else.
</P>
<P>
"There are some contradictions between what Mr. Clinton has
said and what he is doing. On the one hand, he has sent the
U.S. fleet to the Persian Gulf. On the other, he has said that he
is ready to talk to Iran," Velayati said.
</P>
<P>
Velayati said that the pressure on Iran, exemplified in the
20-million dollar bill approved by Washington to engage in covert
action against Iran, is the result of power struggle between the
two main parties in the United States.
</P>
<P>
"Iran has the right to oppose the 20-million-dollar bill
because it is against international rules, the U.N. Charter and
even the Algiers Declaration which was signed by the Americans,+
Velayati said.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said that Point 1 of the Algerian
Declaration states that "the United States pledges that from now
on it will be the policy of the United States not to intervene,
directly or indirectly, politically or militarily, in the Iran's
internal affairs."
</P>
<P>
Velayati said that the U.S. bill to punish non-American
companies for doing business with Iran was against the Uruguay
Roundtable attended by the U.S. which calls for promoting free
trade without any consideration for political constraints.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the latest proposal by Iranian Parliament Speaker
Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri to allocate a budget for covert action
against the U.S., Velayati said that the statement made by
Nateq-Nouri called on the government to help "the concerned
organizations" that have a part in safeguarding the domestic
security and checking foreign plots against Iran.
</P>
<P>
More than 3,000 Iranian extremists staged
anti-U.S. demonstrations Tuesday and the leader of the extremist
group threatened to attack the U.S. interests anywhere in the
world if the U.S. engages in any action against the Iranian
territory.
</P>
<P>
Amid slogans of "Down with USA," a young man said at the rally
"We are ready to attack the U.S. Fifth Fleet in the Persian Gulf
in a kamikaze way."
</P>
<P>
Addressing demonstrators, another young man said that the
Islamic Republic is not afraid of U.S. atomic bomb as it has given
to many martyrs.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the Strait of Hormuz through which two thirds of
the world's oil supply reaches the world market, Hossein Allah
Karam, leader of Ansar Hezbollah, said that the Moslems in the
world have control of the "important bottlenecks" around the
world.
</P>
<P>
"The Islamic Republic has tied our hands because it wants to
respect the international norms, but if our religious leader
allows us, we will put an end to the American domination," he
told his group.
</P>
<P>
Karam claimed that the U.S. has spent 3 billion dollars every
year to topple the Tehran government.
</P>
<P>
The demonstration concluded by burning an empty coffin covered
by an American flag. Karam said the coffin represented the death
of American influence around the world.
</P>
<P>
The coffin was taken to a roof-top near the U.N. building, set
afire and then thrown into the sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati wrote a
strongly worded letter to the U.N. against the blatant proof of
American state terrorism and asked the world body to denounce
Washington's act.
</P>
<P>
On the first day of 1996, Iran claimed it will lodge a protest
with the United Nations and the International Court of Justice if
Washington does not reject the congressional act against the
Islamic republic.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that the war of words between the
Washington administration and the Tehran government are flaring
up. The relations between Iran and USA are going through more
stormy period.
</P>
<P>
They noted that the relations between the United States and
the Islamic Republic seem to be much more intense as both sides
are preparing the presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
However, observers and diplomats here do not see any
likelihood of military confrontation between U.S. forces and
Iranian forces at present.

NEW DELHI, January 3 (Xinhua) -- At least five people were
killed and 21 others injured in a powerful blast in a busy and
congested wholesale market in the Indian capital today, local
police said.
</P>
<P>
The blast, which occurred on the Qutb Road in Sadar Bazar area
in north Delhi at about 15:10 local time, damaged half a dozen
shops, besides several two-wheelers, an autorickshaw and
cycle-rickshaws parked in the vicinity.
</P>
<P>
Police and fire fighters, who reached the site soon after the
explosion, sealed off the area immediately.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of a Kashmiri militant outfit, Jammu and Kashmir
Islamic Front, claimed responsibility for the explosion, saying
the outfit was behind the Connaught Place blast in the capital in
November last year to protest against what he called "atrocities"
in Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
The city police chief, Nikhil Kumar, said at the spot that the
cause of the powerful explosion was being investigated. He said
there was no crater caused by the blast at the site, unlike a
two-feet crater left behind in the Connaught Place explosion.
</P>
<P>
Panic-stricken people ran helter-skelter after the explosion,
causing further problems to the investigating agencies who reached
the site immediately. The injured were rushed to the Bara Hindu
Rao hospital and nearby medical centers.

<HEADLINE> Australian Commodity Exports Face Bright Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Australian commodity exporters
showed optimism about 1996 as accelerating worldwide economic
growth promises a price boom for grain and minerals.
</P>
<P>
Figures from the Australian Wheat Board (AWB) showed that the
country reaped in the third largest wheat harvest in history in
1995.
</P>
<P>
Wheat prices were at the highest point in 15 years when
Australia started to sell its winter crop on the international
market. The world began to sense a possible grain shortage at the
time, but wheat crops in the northern hemisphere were still in the
field due to opposite seasons to Australia.
</P>
<P>
AWB's forecast for the price of Australian wheat this season is
235 Australian dollars (174 US dollars) per ton, the highest level
since World War II.
</P>
<P>
Alec Nickel from AWB said that Australia had sold a
larger-than-usual proportion of last year's wheat crop on contract
for delivery before June, in order to obtain the best price before
American crops reach the market in July.
</P>
<P>
Australia's wheat crop is expected to increase further to 18
million tons this year from 16.7 million tons in 1995, which has
doubled the drought-affected 1994 crop.
</P>
<P>
As the world's grain production is expected to lag behind
consumption in the next two years, Australian growers are quite
optimistic about better returns this year.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resources Economics
(ABARE) forecasts that the country's farm production would reach
4.8 billion Australian dollars (3.6 billion US dollars) in the
year of 1995-96, up 83 percent from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The government commodity forecasting agent also expected
Australian mineral exports to rise by 19 percent to 36.12 billion
Australian dollars (26.73 billion US dollars) in 1995-96.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that tailing off of metal prices is likely to
continue into the early months of 1996, faster world economic
growth, especially the rapid development in Asia, is expected to
boost demand and reduce stocks of minerals.
</P>
<P>
Prices of iron ore and coal, Australia's largest commodity
exports, are forecasted to rise by five percent due to strained
supply, rising steel production and increasing demand in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Nickel is commonly regarded as the glamour metal for the year.
Restocking by stainless steel producers is expected to boost
nickel price to 4.5 US dollars a pound from the present 3.5 US
dollars a pound.
</P>
<P>
WMC, Australia's major mining company with a capacity of
turning out 93,000 tons of nickel every year, will be the happiest
miner in town.
</P>
<P>
Aluminum, zinc and gold also look bright in the next 12 months,
while copper and oil prices are predicted to be flat.

HONG KONG, January 3 (Xinhua) -- The air pollution index (API)
for the whole area of Hong Kong today ranged between 104 to 120,
which is record high since the Hong Kong Environmental Protection
Department issued the index.
</P>
<P>
It is the second high-level API for the area of Hong Kong
issued by the department. On November 10, the index was over 90.
</P>
<P>
An official of the Environmental Protection Department advised
people who are suffering asthma, lung or heart illness to stay
indoors because of the worsening air pollution.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the worsening of the air pollution was
due to the slowdown of the wind Tuesday, which resulted in
deposits of pollutants in the air.
</P>
<P>
He said that the API might drop for stronger wind is expected
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong adopted the API early last June to monitor air

monetary program for 1996, the central bank said today.
</P>
<P>
An IMF mission will arrive here next month to review the

rate for the year.

<P>
Central bank sources said that the growth and inflation rate

to cause any undue inflationary pressure and to support the growth
rate.

In his report to the nation today, President Fidel Ramos said
that the gross national product growth may hit the lower end of
the range target at six percent in 1995.

<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, January 3 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary William
Perry today arrived in Sarajevo on a one-day visit to assess the
progress of the NATO-led peace mission, said reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Perry is the most senior U.S. government official to visit
Bosnia since the outbreak of the civil war in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Perry, accompanied by Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
John Shalikashvili, flew into Sarajevo from Hungary where he had
visited U.S. troops in the transit base Tazsar.
</P>
<P>
In Sarajevo, he is expected to meet with NATO-led IFOR
commanders and Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic on the IFOR
peace operation.
</P>
<P>
Arriving at the Sarajevo airport, Perry said he was optimistic
on the prospect of peace in Bosnia and wanted the IFOR mission to
be clearly defined.
</P>
<P>
Bosnian government has urged the IFOR troops to intervene to
press the Bosnian Serbs to release 16 Muslims they had abducted in
western Serb-held Sarajevo in the past few days. But the IFOR
commanders said it was the mandate of the civilian police force.
</P>
<P>
Perry will also visit Tuzla, the headquarters of the
20,000-strong U.S. IFOR troops, the bulk contingent of the
NATO-led 60,000 multinational implementation force in the war-torn
country.
</P>
<P>
Bosnia is part of Perry's one-week trip to Europe and the
Middle East which will also take him to Ukraine, Oman, Jordan and
Israel.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. defense minister started his visit to U.S. troops at
the Italian Aviano air base on Monday.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, he will attend the neutralization of a launching
ramp for intercontinental SS-19 rockets in Ukraine, where he will
also meet with Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev.
</P>
<P>
He will then head for the Middle East to visit Oman, Saudi
Arabia, Jordan and Israel.

<P>
NAIROBI, January 3 (Xinhua) - The Organization of African
Unity (OAU) today hoped Nigeria would reconsider its decision to
pull out of the African Nations' Soccer Cup scheduled to get
started in South Africa next week.
</P>
<P>
A press release reaching here quoted OAU spokesman Ibrahim
Dagash as saying that the OAU regretted very much nigeria's
choice of withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
"The OAU hopes Nigeria will reconsider its decision to
withdraw if all the necessary arrangements are taken to ensure the
security of its players,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are aware of Nigeria's important role and contributions in
the field of sports in Africa and hope that everything will be
arranged to allow their participation," he added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Nigerian government announced its decision to
withdraw from the bi-annual event, claiming it feared that the
South African government would not provide necessary security
measures to protect the Nigerian players during the contest.
</P>
<P>
But analysts said the act was Nigeria's protest against the
South African government which, led by President Nelson Mandela,
had spearheaded international sanctions against Nigeria over its
hangings of nine Ogoni minority activists last November.
</P>
<P>
Mandela later urged the Nigerian government to choose to
attend the most important sports event in Africa, promising he
would do everything to provide security to the Nigerian
footballers.

<HEADLINE> Anhui Battles Water Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, January 3 (Xinhua) -- East China's Anhui Province will
continue its fight against pollution of the Huaihe River valley
and Chaohu Lake area in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government plans to close this year 257
industrial enterprises which are major polluters. Last year the
local government ordered 56 enterprises to shut down or move, said
an official with the Anhui Provincial Environmental Protection
Bureau.
</P>
<P>
It will also ban small tanneries, chemical plants, printing and
dyeing mills, electroplating factories, and breweries.
</P>
<P>
With the closing of those businesses, the province is expected
to hold the amount of Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) discharged to
308,053 tons in 1996, a 15 percent drop from last year's level,
the official said.
</P>
<P>
He also predicted that the amount of COD in the Huaihe River
Valley will drop to 70,000-100,000 tons by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The Huaihe River Valley is a leading national commodity grain
center and Anhui's largest farm and sideline products center, but
water pollution in the area has gotten worse as the local
government has tried to speed up the economy.
</P>
<P>
To date, seven cities and prefectures along the river have
spent 206 million yuan on 113 waste water treatment facilities,
which have treated some 26.4 million tons of waste water so far
and reduced the amount of COD by 28,000 tons, the official said.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, 20 projects for treating 18 major polluters in
the Chaohu Lake area have been completed, and are expected to cut
the area's discharge of waste water by 12.3 million tons and the
COD by 3,112 tons.
</P>
<P>
Local governments are making use of foreign funds to upgrade
the companies' technology and waste water treatment capacity. The
World Bank will loan 150 million US dollars to the water pollution
treatment projects in the river valley, and the Asian Development
Bank is expected to approve a loan of 100 million US dollars to
control water pollution in Chaohu Lake, the official said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the Australian government loaned six million US
dollars for construction of the Hefei Waste Water Treatment Plant.
</P>
<P>
The province has 64 pollution control projects currently,
involving a total of some four billion yuan.

<HEADLINE> Lee Kuan Yew Leaves for India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew
of Singapore left here today for New Delhi on a three-day official
to India.
</P>
<P>
During his visit there, Lee will call on Prime Minister
Narasimha Rao and have meetings with Finance Minister Manmohan
Singh and Foreign Minister Pranab Mukherjee.
</P>
<P>
An earlier statement from the Prime Minister's Office of
Singapore said that Lee will also address two gatherings while in
New Delhi. The first is at a meeting with Indian opinion-makers at
the India International Center. And the second address is going to
be at a joint meeting of the Associated Chambers of Commerce and
Industry of India, the Federated Chambers of Commerce and
Industry, and the Confederation of Indian Industries.
</P>
<P>
In his two speeches, Lee, who last visited India in 1988 when
he was prime minister, is expected to focus on the economic
liberalization program which India has embarked on since 1991.
</P>
<P>
This is the third year in a row that a Singapore leader goes to
India to keep up the contacts, local observers said.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong was guest at
the centenary celebrations of the Confederation of Indian
Industries in Calcutta. The trip saw 20 million dollars worth of
projects sealed.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, Goh was the chief guest at India's national day
celebrations. Then in September of the year, Indian Prime Minister
Narasimha Rao visited Singapore.
</P>
<P>
While India started its market reforms in 1991, Singapore
embarked on its go-regional program to build its external economy.
Since then, business ties between the two countries have been
expanding further and fast, the observers said.
</P>
<P>
Total trade last year was set to cross four billion Singapore
dollars (about 2.67 billion US dollars). Singapore is now India's
tenth largest investor with 340 million dollars (about 241 million
U.S. dollars) tied up in ventures ranging from airports to
info-tech parks.

<HEADLINE> Purchase of Guns Increases in Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Weapons have always had a special
 place in Turkish society where the possession of one has
traditionally been seen as a symbol of machismo, the local
newspaper Daily News reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the development of the country's weapons
technology, coupled with the political populism of the past
decade, contributed to the spread of arms in the country.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted Ergun Gok, general director of the
state-run Machinery and Chemical Industry (MKE) founded in 1950,
as saying that there had been a great demand for guns over the
past two years. The MKE has also the monopoly for the sale of
imported weapons.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, a total of 22,400 imported guns were
sold from January to November in 1995, and in 1994 this figure was
13,800. In addition, 9,762 older model pistols, commonly called
"Kirikkale" guns after the state factory manufacturing them in the
central Turkish city of the same name, have been sold in the same
period.
</P>
<P>
Gok said nearly 100 guns are sold daily by the MKE, adding that
they sell guns only to the people who get a license from the
Interior Ministry. Most company owners, high-ranking officials and
people who prove that their lives are at risk can get a license
from the ministry to keep or carry guns.
</P>
<P>
The MKE director said that the license to keep or carry a gun
is given to people only to protect themselves in special
conditions, adding that it does not give the right to shoot in the
air even in an open area, or to use it for any other purposes,
except for protection.

<HEADLINE> UK Housing Market to Recover This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 3 (Xinhua) -- A revival in the British housing
market this year seems more likely as recent figures revealed a
pick-up in house prices and mortgage lending in the final months
of last year.
</P>
<P>
The Halifax Building Society, Britain's largest lender, said
Tuesday that house prices in the UK rose by 0.3 of a percentage
point on a seasonally adjusted basis last month.
</P>
<P>
This is the fifth consecutive monthly rise, and Halifax said
this confirmed its view that house prices has become stabilized.
</P>
<P>
Recent falls in mortgage rates will also aid the market in the
new year and the number of house moves is likely to grow more
quickly, increasing by around 10 percent, according to a Halifax
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Figures from the British Bankers' Association, which represents
nine of the 20 largest mortgage lenders in the UK, Tuesday
indicated that a pick-up in the number of house moves is already
being seen when it reported a 10 percent increase in net mortgage
lending during November.
</P>
<P>
The major British banks lent a net 677 million pounds (one
billion U.S. dollars) for house purchases, up from 616 million
pounds (924 million dollars) in October.
</P>
<P>
These figures came on the back of the much more important
building society figures, which showed a 12 percent jump in gross
lending during November to 2.95 billion pounds (4.43 billion
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The lending data for the month added support to the view that
the new year may see a modest improvement in the housing market,
economic forecasters said.

<HEADLINE> Tianjin Boosts Telecommunications and Transport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Tianjin, north China's largest
industrial city, has spurred the development of its
telecommunications and transport industries by increasing
investment in the two industries.
</P>
<P>
During the 1991-1995 period, Tianjin spent 14.5 billion yuan on
the industries, 3.7 times of that in the 1986-1990 period, a city
official said.
</P>
<P>
As a result, telephone switchboards in Tianjin now have a total
of 1.2 million lines, up from 200,000 lines in 1990. Every seven
Tianjin residents have one telephone set now, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The volume of business done by the posts and telecommunications
industry came to 1.8 billion yuan in the 1991-1995 period, 11.2
times that during the 1986-1990 period.
</P>
<P>
All of Tianjin's telephones have become either
program-controled or digitalized, he said.
</P>
<P>
During the past five years, the city has established a
transport network of sea ports, highways, railways, air routes and
subways, he said.
</P>
<P>
The city's transport sector has carried 251.6 million tons of
cargo this year, 58 percent more than in 1990, and 34 million
passengers, up 56.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
After technological upgrading, the Tianjin Railway Station is
capable of accommodating 96 pairs of trains per day. The
cargo-handling capacity of the station's freight yard increased by
40 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin has set up a complete urban public transport
network. It takes only two hours by bus or car from Tianjin to
Beijing with the completion of the Beijing-Tianjin-Tanggu
Expressway, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The Tianjin Airport, one of the country's 12 large
international airports, is able to handle at least two million
passengers and 80,000 tons of cargo and mails every year, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Tianjin Port, the largest port in north China, handles
exports from and imports into 16 province-level areas in the
northwest. It now has 70 wharfs, 48 of which accommodate ships of
10,000 DWT. The port has opened 30 routes for regular passenger or
cargo ships. Cargo ships sail between the Tianjin Port and 300
ports in 160 countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the port has handled 191 million tons
of cargo during the 1991-1995 period, up 84 percent from that in
the 1986-1990 period.

CAIRO, January 3 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary General Boutros
Boutros-Ghali said here today that Yemen and Eritrea will be
holding negotiations within the next few days to solve their
territory dispute.
</P>

After meeting with Arab League Secretary General Esmat
Abdul-Meguid, Ghali reiterated at a press conference that both
Yemen and Eritrea has a political view to settle the dispute over

</P>
<P>
The dispute flared up last month when Yemen and Eritrea had a
fierce battle and Eritrean troops captured the island, claimed by
both countries.
</P>
<P>
Ghali stressed the need to boost Arab-African cooperation and
settle peacefully any dispute that might arise between an Arab and
an African country.
</P>
<P>
Ghali, who arrived in his own country Sunday night after his
visit to Yemen and Eritrea, also reviewed with Abdul-Meguid ties
between the U.N. and Arab League.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. secretary general told reporters that his meeting with
the Arab League chief is to promote ties between the two
organizations.
</P>
<P>
At their meeting, the two also discussed a number of other
regional and international issues, including the U.N. sanctions on
Iraq, the crisis in the relations between Libya and the West as
well as the situation in Somalia.

Mozambican police started tracking down the murderers
immediately after the incident. According to analysis, the
assault on the Zimbabwean diplomat was aimed at robbing his car,
and without political reason probably.
</P>
<P>
Police said the security in the capital has been worsening
recently since armed gunmen attack foreigners, robbing money and
cars.

<HEADLINE> HK to See Rosy Overseas Markets in New Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong expects steady
retail growth in its major overseas markets in 1996, as predicted
by the territory's Trade and Development Council (TDC).
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's big trade partners -- China's mainland, Japan and
Europe will see moderate growth in their retail sales, according
to Edward Leung, TDC's chief economist. While business
opportunities with the United States will be centered on the
home-furnishing industry.
</P>
<P>
He said that the mainland, Hong Kong's leading trade partner,
is expected to have robust growth in retail market in accordance
with its sustained economic expansion and falling inflation.
</P>
<P>
Consumer spending shows no sign of abating after a 29-percent
rise through the first 11 months of 1995, said Leung. Moreover,
The mainland has decided to lower import tariffs from this April,
which will buoy up Hong Kong's entrepot trade with it.
</P>
<P>
For Hong Kong's second largest trade partner, the united
States, Leung said that demand for home-oriented items will be
strong, such as computers, home entertainment systems and home
furnishing goods.
</P>
<P>
In the first ten months of 1995, Hong Kong's trade with major
overseas markets all recorded significant growth rates of between
14 and 19 percent. Hong Kong's total trade volume with China's
mainland increased 17 percent to 818 billion HK dollars (105
billion US dollars).

<HEADLINE> HK Economy to Retain Sustained Growth: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 3 (Xinhua) -- In the coming year Hong Kong's
economy will enjoy sustained growth and the moderating trend in
consumer price inflation is likely to continue, said a senior Hong
Kong official.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a British Chamber of Commerce luncheon on "Hong
Kong's Economic Policies and Outlook for 1996" today, Donald
Tsang, the financial secretary, said he remains optimistic about
the economic conditions of Hong Kong in 1996.
</P>
<P>
He said that in the new year, the external environment looks
promising for a further sustained growth in Hong Kong's exports of
goods and services; investment will remain intensive; and a mild
revival in consumer spending looks likely in the latter part of
the year.
</P>
<P>
"I notice that a few bankers have projected a growth of around
4.8-5 percent for 1996, largely in line with our trend growth
rate," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Hong Kong's economy showed a mixed performance in
1995, with growth expected to be around 5 percent in real terms,
although slower than in the preceding years, it is no recession by
any standards.
</P>
<P>
He said that in 1995 investment spending continued to show a
large increase and the sharp rise in retained imports in the first
ten months was largely production and investment-related.
</P>
<P>
The unfavorable influences on consumer demand should abate in
the months ahead, he said, adding that both equity and property
prices have now stabilized.
</P>
<P>
These statistics indicate firm business confidence in the Hong
Kong economy, he said.
</P>
<P>
"I am encouraged to see the consensus among our analysts that
Hong Kong will remain the center in this part of the world, with
excellent potential for further growth in the longer term," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He added that a task force had been established to review what
the government can do to support the further expansion of the
service sectors, and to enhance the territory's position as a
major financial center in the region.

<HEADLINE> Orphans in Earthquake-Stricken City Growing up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Wang An was just a
three-year-old boy when he was pulled out of the rubble-strewn
remains of 20th century's China's most deadly earthquake, which
killed all the other members of his family.
</P>
<P>
The Tangshan earthquake of July 28, 1976, which registered 7.8
on the Richter Scale, levelled the industrial city that lies
200-odd km to the northeast of Beijing, claiming more than 240,000
lives and turning 4,204 children into orphans overnight. One of
these was Wang.
</P>
<P>
"I am an orphan but I was not left alone because many people
have always looked after me," said Wang, 22, who spent most of his
life at the Tangshan Welfare Center.
</P>
<P>
He is now an employee of a local hospital, an example of all
the Tangshan orphans who have gotten jobs and become independent.
</P>
<P>
It was soon after the disastrous earthquake that Wang An and
1,000 other children were sent to state-run welfare centers and
orphan schools in Tangshan, Xingtai and Shijiazhuang cities, in
Hebei Province.
</P>
<P>
Another 3,000 orphans were adopted by relatives or by their
parents' work units and enterprises, where their daily needs were
taken care of.
</P>
<P>
With help from the government and society, the orphans grew up
and were provided with an ordinary education before going to work
and developing their own independent lives. Some 200 of them have
received college or university diplomas.
</P>
<P>
The city government even paved the way for them to find jobs by
ordering government institutions and enterprises to employ a
certain number. In return, the orphans have worked hard, with some
1,000 of them having been recognized for their outstanding work.

NEW DELHI, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Protest over Indian Prime
Minister P. V. Narasimha Rao's directive demanding Karnataka state
release six thousand million cubic (TMC) feet of Cauvery water to
the state of Tamil Nadu continued in Karnataka today.
</P>
<P>
Karnataka Chief Minister H. D. Deve Gowda is now holding
consultations with leaders of all parties over the directive,
which was announced Monday night.
</P>
<P>
Protesters, mainly students and farmers, held up two trains,
blocked road traffic and held demonstrations in different pockets
in the Mandya district in the Cauvery basin but the situation
overall remained peaceful.
</P>
<P>
The state's Home Minister P. G. R. Sindhia told reporters that
as a precautionary measure, four companies of the Central Reserve
Police Force had arrived in the state capital of Bangalore.
</P>
<P>
In Bangalore, activists burnt the effigies of Rao and Tamil
Nadu Chief Minister J. Jayalalitha, while attempts by some college
students to march in processions were foiled by the police.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Karnataka cabinet sub-committee, formed Tuesday
on the Cauvery water issue, is expected to meet later today to
consider the directive.
</P>
<P>
Tamil Nadu has asked its neighboring state of Karnataka to
release 11 TMC feet of water to save the standing crops in the
state.
</P>
<P>
But Karnataka has repeatedly rejected the request, arguing that
Tamil Nadu has adequate water at present for its crops.

<P>
NEW DELHI, January 3 (Xinhua) -- The second meeting of the
finance and planning ministers of the South Asian Association for
Regional Cooperation (SAARC) opened here today with the seven
member countries beginning to work out modalities for eradicating
poverty in the region.
</P>
<P>
Indian External Affairs Minister and deputy Chairman of the
Planning Commission Pranab Mukherjee said in an opening speech
that the best remedy for poverty was to achieve a level of growth
that could generate adequate income for all.
</P>
<P>
Mukherjee said a good beginning had already been made after
only a few weeks into the implementation of the South Asian
Preferential Trading Agreement.
</P>
<P>
"We have a vision of establishing free trade in this region by
the year 2005. This will benefit the people of the South Asian
region by expanding job opportunities leading to higher income
generation, and will bring us closer towards the goal of
eradicating poverty," he said.
</P>
<P>
The ministers also made speeches agreeing that the region has
tremendous resources which, if exploited jointly, could provide
the people with a minimum of level of income that could lift them
above the poverty line and make the region prosperous.
</P>
<P>
The first meeting of the SAARC finance and planning ministers
was held in July 1994 in Dhaka, where a mechanism was established
for free flow of information on poverty eradication among the
member countries -- India, Pakistan, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh,
Bhutan and the Maldives.

He also found that eight percent of the police had inflammation

However, the lead level in their blood was below the dangerous

HANOI, January 3 (Xinhua) -- A local newspaper today called on

</P>
<P>
The "New Hanoi" newspaper said various forms of social evils
have emerged in many hotels, bars, restaurants, massage parlors

</P>

"All these law-breaking operations have gradually eroded the
traditional elegance as well as customs and practice of the Hanoi

<P>
It called on the Hanoi population to build a healthy social and
cultural environment, thus contributing to what it called a

</P>
<P>
Vietnam is launching a nation-wide campaign to ensure
discipline and order in cultural activities in accordance with

<HEADLINE> Buildings in Earthquake-Hit City Rising Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 3 (Xinhua) -- A 114.4-m-high building has been
erected in downtown Tangshan as the north China city prepares to
mark the 20th anniversary of the Tangshan earthquake this year.
</P>
<P>
Soaring skyward near the Tangshan Earthquake Monument, the
Phoenix Mansion is the first building over 100 m high in the city.
</P>
<P>
Another 14 highrises have also been completed or are still
under construction, the "People's Daily" said today.
</P>
<P>
The 7.8-magnitude Tangshan quake on July 28, 1976 was the most
destructive one in 20th century China, leveling the industrial
city and claiming a heavy loss of lives and property damage.
</P>
<P>
Since then the Tangshan people, with help of the whole country,
have rebuilt their city. And today it has re-emerged as a leading
industrial base only a five-hour drive from Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Numbers of five- or six-story apartment buildings have been
built for local residents in the past two decades. The local
government's achievements in providing residents with habitats
also helped the city win a United Nations "Human Settlement Award"
in 1990.
</P>
<P>
However, the unified style of the ordinary appartment buildings
has made many of the Tangshan residents feel a bit "monotonous",
and they wanted to have a few highrises to dot with them, the
paper said.
</P>
<P>
The city government then decided to construct some modern-style
highrise buildings last year in order to improve the image of the
city.
</P>
<P>
Mushrooming skyscrapers have become a common sign of developed
economies in the country's prosperous areas and cities, such as
Shanghai, Beijing, Guangzhou and south China's special economic
zones.

<HEADLINE> South Korea's Trade Deficit Rises by 56 Percent in 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, January 3 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's trade deficit is
estimated to have reached 9.87 billion U.S. dollars last year, up
56 percent from the 6.34 billion dollars in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The country's exports soared 30.4 percent from 1994 to 125.23
billion dollars last year while imports increased 32 percent to
135.1 billion dollars, the International Trade and Industry
Ministry announced today.
</P>
<P>
Heavy and chemical industry products accounted for 72.3 percent
of the total exports and semiconductor exports in particular grew
73 percent from 13 billion dollars in 1994 to 22.5 billion dollars
in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Specifically, exports of electronic and electric goods topped
the list of export goods by claiming 32.8 percent of the total,
followed by textiles with 18 percent, chemical goods with 6.2
percent, iron and steel goods with 5.8 percent, automobiles with
5.6 percent and ships with 5.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
The ministry expects that South Korea's export growth this year
will decline to 13.4 percent with the total volume standing at 142
billion dollars due to negative factors like the weakening of the
Japanese yen and the strengthening of the South Korean won.
</P>
<P>
The country's imports growth, meanwhile, are likely to rise
10.3 percent to 149 billion dollars this year as international
prices of raw materials have been stabilized and facility
investment in South Korea is expected to slow down, according the
ministry.

<HEADLINE> China Combating Tuberculosis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, January 3 (Xinhua) -- China has worked on a
tuberculosis treatment program since 1993 in an effort to control
the highly infectious disease.
</P>
<P>
Public health officials here said that under the program,
tuberculosis patients are given treatment for as much as 50 to 80
percent off the normal cost, or even for free if they have
particular financial difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Thirteen Chinese provinces are currently taking part in the
program, with more expected to join in, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
In central China's Henan Province, the program began in
September 1993 in 12 counties. In the first year, 4,480 patients
were identified and 97 percent of them received proper treatment,
the officials said. The program now covers 44 counties in Henan.
</P>
<P>
The World Health Organization has warned that tuberculosis has
become a major killer, with as many as 10 million people worldwide
possibly dying of the disease annually if proper measures are not
taken.
</P>
<P>
Experts estimate that a tuberculosis patient may infect 15
other people each year, causing labor and other economic losses in
society. As medical science has advanced, however, tuberculosis
has become a curable disease.
</P>
<P>
The treatment adopted by Chinese doctors is the
internationally-advocated DOTS model, using short-term
chemotherapy directly observed by doctors.

<HEADLINE> China to Open Largest Manchurian Tiger Park to Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, January 3 (Xinhua) -- A large park set up to breed
Manchurian tigers, a species on the verge of extinction, in the
wilderness will open to tourists here later this month.
</P>
<P>
According to a park official, the Forest Park for Manchurian
Tigers, the first of its kind in the country, covers 125 ha and is
located one km north of the Sun Island, a scenic spot in this
capital of Heilongjiang Province in northeast China.
</P>
<P>
The park will have 30 Manchurian tigers supplied by the China
Hengdaozi Breeding Center for the Cat Family Animals, the world's
largest breeding center for Manchurian tigers, said Liu Xichen,
director of the center.
</P>
<P>
Climatic and geographical conditions in the park are ideal for
the growth, breeding and training of the tigers, he said.
</P>
<P>
Manchurian tigers will be trained to adapt to the natural
environment in the wilderness before being returned to the forest
eventually, Liu said, adding that this is the "best and most
efficient way" to protect the tigers.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the conviction that the park will certainly
attract large numbers of visitors. The proceeds will be used to
fund research on and breeding of the tigers.
</P>
<P>
A forest nature reserve for Manchurian tigers, which are under
special state protection, has already been established in
Heilongjiang. The Hengdaozi Breeding Center for Animals of the Cat
Family, set up in 1986, has bred 80 cubs so far.
</P>
<P>
Manchurian tigers, which live in northeast China and Siberia in
Russia, have been listed as one of the ten animal species on the
verge of extinction by the World Wildlife Fund. To date, some 300
Manchurian tigers still live in the wilderness.

<HEADLINE> Ancient Tombs of Ethnic Minority Group in Three Gorges Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Tombs of the Ba people, dating
from some 3,200 years ago, have been found at a site which will be
submerged after the Three Gorges project is completed.
</P>
<P>
The Xianglushi site is located in Changyang County in central
China's Hubei Province in the Three Gorges area, where work on the
largest water conservation project is underway.
</P>
<P>
The site, from which the Xianglushi Culture got its name, has
examples of the early culture of the Ba people, a large ancient
ethnic minority group living in the valley on the middle reaches
of the Yangtze River, for whom few records have been left.
</P>
<P>
Chinese archaeologists say that the new finds of five Ba tombs
under a cliff will contribute a lot to the study of the
little-known minority group.
</P>
<P>
Experts have paid special attention to one of the tombs whose
contents are a skeleton 1.76 m in length, said to be that of a
person of a higher social status.
</P>
<P>
Also found in the tomb were China's largest oracle bone and a
big bone spoon. The oracle bone, made of the shoulder blade of an
ox, is 42 cm long and has more than 100 holes in it.
</P>
<P>
The experts say that the bone spoon, 26.6 cm long, is exquisite
and is the best specimen of its kind ever found.
</P>
<P>
A total of 318 relics, including pottery, stoneware, boneware,
and bronzes, have been found in the tombs.

<HEADLINE> 188 Local Palestinians to Be Added to PNC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 3 (Xinhua) -- A Senior Palestinian official
said in Tel Aviv Tuesday that all 88 members of the elected
Palestinian Council (PC) and the 100 losing candidates with the
largest number of votes will become members of the Palestinian
National Council (PNC).
</P>
<P>
According to today's Jerusalem Post, Nabil Shaath, planning
minister of the Palestinian National Authority (PNA), made the
remarks at the annual Jimmy Carter lecture at the Tel Aviv
University, saying that the PNC will revoke anti-Israel clauses
in the Palestinian Covenant by March.
</P>
<P>
Shaath said the by-laws of the PNC call for 50 percent of its
members to be elected from the homeland, when that becomes
possible, so the PNA can not be accused of stacking the PNC.
</P>
<P>
He said that the election of 188 local members would
significantly increase the chances of reaching necessary two-third
 vote for revocation, and that he believed a sufficient number of
other PNC members will support revocation.
</P>
<P>
Shaath also said that PNA-Hamas talks in Cairo failed because
they were too public, but the main reason Hamas is not running in
the elections is its fear of "winning only 10 percent of the
seats, which would be a blow to its status."
</P>
<P>
The first Palestinian elections in the West Bank and Gaza are
scheduled to take place on January 20, and the election campaign
kicked off Tuesday afternoon as election banners appeared on the
streets in Gaza.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, three senior Hamas activists, who registered only
three days ago as independent candidates for the 88-member PC
elections, withdrew their nominations "due to the eruption of
confusion" in the Islamic movement.
</P>
<P>
Sources in Gaza said that Hamas leaders abroad ordered them to
withdraw, following a leaflet, issued by Hamas on Monday,
dissociating itself from the three Hamas members, Ismail Haniye,
Khaled Hindi and Said Namrouti, who declared their candidacies
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
However, several other lower-level Hamas and Islamic figures
will still be running as independents, while nine are linked to
pro-Arafat Islamic parties like the Islamic Struggle Movement and
Islamic Jihad Al-Aqsa brigades.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Expects No Policy Change in Saudi Arabia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, January 3 (Xinhua) -- King Hussein of Jordan said
Tuesday that he did not expect any changes in Saudi Arabia's
policy as a result of Crown Prince Abdullah's taking over the
running of the country at the request of King Fahd, the local
daily Jordan Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein wished King Fahd a speedy and complete recovery,
and hailed as "a dear brother" Prince Abdullah, to whom ailing
King Fahd temporarily handed over the power of the government
Monday, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
"There are no differences between our brothers...and I am full
of confidence" about the future of Jordanian-Saudi relations,
King Hussein was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Abdul-Karim Kabariti also said that the
change in Saudi Arabia will only help improve inter-Arab
relations as well as Jordanian-Saudi ties.
</P>
<P>
"Prince Abdullah has always been an advocate of improved ties"
between Jordan and Saudi Arabia, said Kabariti, who added that a
visit by his Saudi counterpart Prince Saud al-Faisal to Jordan
will take place soon.
</P>
<P>
King Fahd is recovering from an apparent stroke which sent him
to hospital for a week last month. A scheduled visit by the King
to Saudi Arabia was postponed due to his illness.
</P>
<P>
King Fahd, 73, who is also prime minister, issued a royal
order Monday asking the Crown Prince, who is a half brother of
King Fahd and the first deputy prime minister, "to undertake the
affair of the state while we enjoy rest."
</P>
<P>
However, King Fahd did not abdicate.
</P>
<P>
Crown Prince Abdullah, about a year younger than King Fahd,
accepted the task and told the King he would consult him when
necessary.
</P>
<P>
The Crown Prince, head of the well-armed 57,000-man National
Guard, has been largely running the country since the King's
illness.

<HEADLINE> Laos Encourages Coffee Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 3 (Xinhua) -- The Laotian government has
adopted a policy to support coffee cultivation, according to a
report from Laos today.
</P>
<P>
The policy, including tax exemption for coffee and other
export-oriented commodities, is expected to help increase the
country's annual coffee output from 10,000 tons to 100,000 tons in
10 years' time, said the report.
</P>
<P>
It added that Laos now needs new technologies and new
plantations to double the current yield of 600 kilograms of coffee
beans per hectare. Some of the old coffees bushes dated as far
back as the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
With the fertile red basaltic soil, the Bolaven plateau in
southern Laos is home to about 95 percent of Lao's coffee
production, worth 25 million US dollars every year.
</P>
<P>
At least 40,000 hectares on the plateau and several thousand
hectares in central Laos and areas near the Vietnamese border are
suitable for coffee cultivation, said Laotian Agriculture Minister
Sisavath Keobounphanh.
</P>
<P>
Laos exports some 90 percent of its coffee output to Europe,
Asia, the United States and Russia.  France is its biggest buyer.

<HEADLINE> Hainan to Become China's Key Natural Gas Chemical Industrial Base </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Hainan Province, which abounds in
natural gas resources, is developing into one of China's leading
natural gas chemical industrial bases.
</P>
<P>
Its newly-built Ya13-1 natural gas field began to supply
natural gas to Hong Kong and Hainan on the new year's day.
</P>
<P>
A ten-year survey by the Chinese ocean petroleum departments
and foreign trans-national oil companies showed that areas around
the Hainan Island consisting of the Pearl River estuary basin, the
Qiongdongnan basin, the Yinggehai basin and Beibu Gulf basin are
rich in natural gas resources.
</P>
<P>
Experts here estimated that the prospective reserves of the
natural gas total 3,000 billion cubic meters and that of oil 2.3
billion tons.
</P>
<P>
Gas fields in Yinggehai include the Ya13-1 gas field with the
verified reserve of 96.8 billion cubic meters of gas, the
Dongfang1-1 gas field with a reserve of 80.1 billion cubic meters,
and the Ya35-1 gas fields with a reserve of between 60 and 70
billion cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
Geologists and oil workers have discovered rich oil reserves in
the Wei12-1 and Wei12-8 structures in the Beibu Gulf Basin, and a
good sign of oil and gas in the Qiongdongnan and Pearl River
estuary basins.
</P>
<P>
Encouraged by the central government, Hainan has worked out a
detailed plan to tap natural gas resources to generate power,
build large chemical fertilizer base and develop natural gas
chemical industry.
</P>
<P>
The plan complies with the program of the national offshore oil
departments to speed up the prospecting and development of oil and
natural gas in the South China Sea.
</P>
<P>
According to the program, China plans to prospect 550 billion
to 700 billion cubic meters of natural gas in this area by the
year 2007.
</P>
<P>
The area's annual natural gas output is expected to reach 10
billion cubic meters by the end of this century, and 21 billion
billion cubic meters by 2007.
</P>
<P>
After becoming a chemical fertilizer base, a local official
said, Hainan will help alleviate the shortage of chemical
fertilizer in China, which lacks 10 million tons of fertilizer
annually.
</P>
<P>
The province will invest 10 billion yuan in building three
synthetic ammonia and urea plants in the coming five years.
</P>
<P>
With an annual use of 2.2 billion cubic meters of natural gas,
these plants will, upon completion, turn out 450,000 tons of
synthetic ammonia and 780,000 tons of urea a year respectively.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the province plans to build a methanol plant with an
annual production capacity of one million tons, a chemical works
to make comprehensive use of natural gas, and an acetylene salt
chemical works.

<P>
CANBERRA, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Croatia was kept a place in the
Hopman Cup tennis finals by defeating the United States 2-1 on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Goran Ivanisevic kept hope of Croatia for the finals after Iva
Majoli was beaten by Chanda Rubin in the opening women's singles.
</P>
<P>
Ivanisevic's big serve saw him to a 7-6 (7/2), 6-3 win over
Richey Reneberg and then he teamed up with Majoli for a 6-4, 6-2
hammering of Reneberg and Rubin in the mixed doubles.
</P>
<P>
The 2-1 win in Group A, Croatia's second after beating France
on Monday, confirmed their top seed status. They have one more
group match Thursday against South Africa, who lost to the U.S.
team on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Croatia look set to meet Germany, unbeaten in Group B, in
Saturday's final.
</P>
<P>
Rubin gave the United States an excellent start when she
confounded the world rankings to overwhelm Majoli 7-5, 6-0.
Rubin, 19, is ranked 15 while her Croat opponent is number nine.
</P>
<P>
Rubin had to work hard to take the opening set, but once she
had found her rhythm she blitzed her 18-year-old opponent in the
second set.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Oil Policy Not to Change </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, January 3 (Xinhua) -- The oil policy of Saudi
Arabia will not change, the local newspaper Emirates News reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted a Gulf industrial source as saying that
the kingdom's oil policy is not going to change as a result of a
temporary hand-over of power by King Fahd to his half brother
Crown Prince Abdulla.
</P>
<P>
King Fahd announced on New Year's day that he needed time to
recuperate from an apparent stroke, and temporarily placed Crown
Prince Abdulla in charge of the government.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia exports 7 million barrels of oil a day out of its
8 million barrels output, or more than 10 percent of the world's
daily requirement.
</P>
<P>
Oil markets are very sensitive to any political or policy
changes in the kingdom because of Saudi Arabia's vital importance
as a crucial supplier to the import-dependent economies of Europe,
Asia and the U.S..
</P>
<P>
Brent crude oil future for February delivery on London's
International Petroleum exchange traded as high as 18.55
U.S. dollars a barrel Tuesday, 22 cents up from its previous
close, according to media reports.

<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Science associations across the
country are playing an increasingly important role in applying new
techniques to industrial production.
</P>
<P>
This coastal city in northeast China's Liaoning Province alone
has increased its taxes and profits by 75 million yuan over the
past two years through the application of new techniques.
</P>
<P>
There are now several hundred societies in the city which are
taking an active part in personnel transfer, technological
development, information service, fund flow, land lease and
scientific management.
</P>
<P>
The international department of the municipal science
association frequently sponsors exchanges between Chinese and
Japanese enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The municipal science association gives top priority to the
countryside. It has set up a special rice society in Lianshan
Township, inviting rice experts from Beijing and Hunan to
popularize new rice strains in the area. Farmers in 14 townships
around Lianshan have joined the society.
</P>
<P>
The associations also seek national expansion. A type of
fertilizer developed by the Plant Nutrition Institute of Dalian
has been spread to 11 provinces across the country with the aid of
a district science association. The association has also helped
the institute build three fertilizer plants outside the
province. At present, the new product spawns 11 million yuan-worth
of new taxes and profits annually.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 3 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela might meet his Nigerian counterpart Sani Abacha to
resolve a sports crisis, a local daily "the Citizen" reported
today.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Ministry of Sport and Recreation yesterday
said that the talks between Mandela and Abacha was the last
resort, if all other methods failed, to resolve the crisis
brought about by Nigeria's withdrawal from the 16-team African
Cup of Nations Football Tournament.
</P>
<P>
The tournament is scheduled to be held in South Africa from
January 13 to February 3.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's Minister of Sport Jim Nwobodo announced in Lagos at
the weekend that Nigeria's national football team "the Super
Eagles" would not participate in the tournament, saying the South
African authorities had failed to give assurances regarding the
safety of its players.
</P>
<P>
Relations between South Africa and Nigeria have been tense
since the Nigerian military regime hanged nine activists in
November last year.
</P>
<P>
Mandela has been leading a campaign for an international oil
embargo against Nigeria.

<HEADLINE> Tibet Makes Strides in Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Seventy percent of Tibet's
school-age children have been enrolled in schools, said an
official with the Tibet Autonomous Regional State Educational
Commission at a regional meeting on education.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the enrollment rate in Shannan and Nyingchi
prefectures and Lhasa City, the capital, passes 80 percent, he
said, adding that Quxu County and Chengguan Region of Lhasa have
popularized six-year compulsory education.
</P>
<P>
The region plans to popularize nine-year compulsory education,
the same as the other provincial-level areas in China. To achieve
this goal, local governments initiated an annual responsibility
system in 1994, which has greatly promoted the region's basic
education.
</P>
<P>
Prefecture and county governments are asked to earmark 15 to 20
percent of their budgets to improve school facilities. Many local
people have contributed labor and construction materials to build
and expand middle and primary schools, the official said.
</P>
<P>
During the past three years they have built 21 new middle
schools, 237 township primary schools and 815 village primary
schools across the region. In 1995 alone, some 480 new schools
were built, he said.
</P>
<P>
To date, there are more than 3,900 primary schools and 89
middle schools in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
With training given by the Regional Educational Commission, the
region is seeing the growth of a mostly-Tibetan teacher body.
</P>
<P>
The number of students in schools is growing by 20,000 to
30,000 annually, while the regional illiteracy rate drops two
percent every year, the official said.
</P>
<P>
By September 1995 some 70 percent of the region's 340,000
children aged seven to 13 had been enrolled in primary
schools. The region now has 290,000 middle and primary school
students (excluding those studying in other parts of China), 61.8
percent more than in 1990, he said.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that by 1998 the region's enrollment rate will
rise to 80 percent, two years earlier than scheduled.

<HEADLINE> Welterweight Champion Charged With Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Welterweight boxing champion
of the International Boxing Council Hector ''Macho'' Camacho was
accused of intimidating eight office workers in San Juan, Puerto
Rico, according to reports reaching here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A civil lawsuit filed in Superior Court in San Juan asks for
126,000 U.S. dollars in damages from Camacho, 33, of Boca Raton,
Florida.
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit alleges that the boxer intimidated aggressively
eight people at the offices of Artcom Services in San Juan in
August. Camacho searched the offices for a wallet he said
contained 2,000 dollars that had been stolen from him, the lawsuit
said.
</P>
<P>
The plaintiffs' lawyer, Samuel Gonzalez Gonzalez, said Camacho
was scheduled to appear at court hearing in Puerto Rico on
Feburary 23 on criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
In a separate case, Camacho was charged in Orlando, Florida, on
December 16 with aggravated assault and domestic violence for
allegedly pushing his 2.5 months-pregnant girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
Camacho, a former World Boxing Council welterweight champion,
was known for his flamboyant style in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
In August, he retained his International Boxing Council
welterweight title by beating Gary Kirkland on a technical
knockout. However, that title is considered the least valuable by
the three major bodies that sanction the sport.
</P>
<P>
Camacho is scheduled to fight Sal Lopez January 16.

KAMPALA, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Air India has launched its
maiden flight to Entebbe International Airport, 40 kilometers
south of Kampala after a 23-year lull, the local newspaper "the
Monitor" reported today.
</P>
<P>
An Airbus 310 on Tuesday touched down at the airport at 4:30pm

The resumption of Air India services to Uganda is the outcome
of negotiations held in India between Uganda Civil Aviation
Authority and Air India.

Air India area manager for east Africa region Zom Hranga was
quoted by the paper as saying that his company had resumed the
service after realizing the huge market potential.

He explained, "Uganda has a lot of market for India. There are
many Ugandan students in India and also Ugandans are traditional
trade partners. The Indian community in Uganda is increasing
now."

NEW DELHI, January 3 (Xinhua) -- The Karnataka state government
of India Tuesday deferred a decision on Prime Minister P.V.
Narasimha Rao's directive to release six billion cubic (TMC) feet
of Cauvery waters to Tamil Nadu after a meeting of the council of
ministers and later an all-party meeting.
</P>
<P>
According to the Times of India today, the all-party meeting of
the state was inconclusive and has been adjourned until Wednesday

At the council of ministers meeting of the state, a nine-member
cabinet sub-committee headed by Chief Minister H.D. Deve Gowda was
formed to decide on the issue.

<P>
In his latest efforts to resolve the Cauvery waters tangle,
Prime Minister Rao Monday asked Karnataka to release six billion
TMC feet of water to Tamil Nadu immediately in order to save the
standing crops in the state.
</P>
<P>
Related reports today said that an all party-meeting convened
by Tamil Nadu Chief Minister J. Jayalalitha resolved Tuesday night
to accept the prime minister's decision as an interim measure.

DHAKA, January 3 (Xinhua) -- The Election Commission (EC) in
Bangladesh has partially revised the schedule of the upcoming
general elections in order to ensure participation of all
political parties.
</P>
<P>
According to an EC announcement last night, the last date for
filing of nomination papers shifted from January 3 to 8 and the
scrutiny of the nomination papers and the last date for withdrawal
of nomination also changed to January 9-14 from January 4-9.
</P>
<P>
But the polling date will remain unchanged on February 7, the
EC said, adding that it partially revised the schedule at the
request of various parties. It hoped that the political parties
would reach an understanding during this period and participate in
the upcoming polls.
</P>
<P>
This is for the second time the EC has revised the polls
schedule. On December 3, the EC announced the schedule fixing
January 18 for the polls date. But on December 15, it shifted the
polls date to February 7 because the opposition parties boycotted
the polls schedule as the government side could not make
compromise to the issue of the formation of a neutral caretaker
government to hold the elections demanded by the opposition.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Five projects dealing with
air, water and noise pollution, biological diversity and waste
recycling have been planned by east China's Jiangsu Province,
China Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2000, dust- and smoke-emission control will cover
all of Jiangsu's major cities and 80 percent of 130 towns and
villages. Smoke-control areas will also be designated along the
railways and State-level highways.
</P>
<P>
With a project called "Blue Sky", most residents' homes will
have a gas supply and central heating, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The project called "Clear Water" will address pollution in
southern Jiangsu's section of the Grand Canal, Taihu Lake, and
water resources in the northern parts of the province.
</P>
<P>
Controls will be implemented to reduce to less than 55 decibels
the noise level in cities with a population of less than two
million by the year of 2000, and 70 percent of the province's
major cities are expected to reach the same standards.
</P>
<P>
Some eleven demonstration areas limited to non-polluting
enterprises will be established in major cities, and by the year
2000, a group of ecological villages and towns will be set up.
</P>
<P>
In the following five years, Jiangsu will build an incinerator,
using advanced Italian techniques, to handle one million tons of
hazardous wastes annually, recycling the heat from the
incinerating process.

But many of them have largely ignored the advice and done little

<HEADLINE> German Mark Continues to Rise in 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, JANUARY 2 (Xinhua) -- Germany's machine-building,
aerospace, automobile and other export-oriented industries lost
more than 100 million marks due to the rise of the German mark
against the currencies of other industrial countries in 1995.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics of the German Bundesbank, the mark rose
an average of 3.4 percent and 6.7 percent over 1994 and 1993,
respectively, against 18 other major currencies of industrial
countries.
</P>
<P>
The exchange rate between the mark and the currencies of other
European Union (EU) states edged up 2 percent in 1995 compared
with that at the end of 1994.
</P>
<P>
The mark gained 8 percent and 11.7 percent, respectively,
against the U.S. dollar and Japanese yen at the end of 1995 in
comparison with a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
Financial experts had predicted in early 1995 that the exchange
rate between the dollar and mark would stabilize at 1:1.60 to
1:1.70.
</P>
<P>
However, the prediction vanished quickly like soap bubbles with
the dramatic fall of the dollar caused by the Mexican financial
crisis, a trade war between the United States and Japan over autos
and auto parts, as well as a strong earthquake that jolted Japan
last year. As a result, the dollar plummeted to a record low of
1.3620 marks on April 19, 1995.
</P>
<P>
Last year, only the currencies of a few industrial countries
such as Switzerland, Sweden, Finland, Denmark and Belgium rose
slightly against the mark.

<HEADLINE> Argentina's Foreign Debt Reaches 87 Billion U.S. Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Argentina's foreign debt
soared nine billion U.S. dollars to reach 87 billion dollars in
1995, or 2,485 dollars per capita.
</P>
<P>
The increase in 1995 surpassed the debt increases between 1991
and 1994, according to statistics from the Finance Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Analysts attributed the growth in foreign debt to five
factors: state refinanced interest of 4.4 billion dollars; 3.8
billion dollars received from abroad to deal with the financial
crisis; the lack of surpluses in the state treasury; an
800-million-dollar loan, and the end of the privatization program.

<HEADLINE> Zapatistas Call for Creation of National Political Front </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, January 2 (Xinhua) -- On the second anniversary of
the armed uprising by the National Liberation Zapatista Army
(EZLN), its General Command has called for the formation of a new
political force to push for democracy.
</P>
<P>
Subcommander Marcos called for the formation of the
National Liberation Zapatista Front (FZLN) as "an effort for a
transition to democracy," the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Marcos called on civilian, indigenous people, workers,
peasants and religious organizations, and the whole of society to
form the new force.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued Monday on the second anniversary of the
EZLN armed uprising, Marcos said the future front will be a civil
and peaceful organization. It will not be a political party,
because it will not fight for political power, but will promote
a new congress and a new constitution, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The EZLN warned that it would not disappear as an armed entity,
and at proper time and conditions it would participate
directly in the creation of the FZLN.
</P>
<P>
The Zapatista emerged during an armed uprising in January 1994
in Chiapas, a southern state of Mexico, demanding land and
democracy. More than 100 people were killed in the
uprising.

SHANGHAI, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Deng Xiaoping's theories of
building socialism with Chinese characteristics, which have been
taught in 34 institutions of higher learning, will be taught at

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Myanma government forces have
taken over opium warlord Khun Sa's stronghold in eastern Myanmar's
Shan State, about 30 kilometers from the Thai border, Thai
newspapers said today.
</P>
<P>
The troops met no resistance when they entered the town of Ho
Mong on the morning of the New Year's day, reporters quoted
witnesses as saying on the telephone.
</P>
<P>
However, the whereabouts of 61-year-old Khun Sa were unknown,
leading to speculation on a possible deal between him and the
Myanma authorities, in which he might have agreed to surrender in
exchange of an amnesty.
</P>
<P>
Last November, Khun Sa formally stepped down as commander of
his well-armed Mong Tai army and expressed the hope for asylum in
Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Thailand said that if ever the drug lord were found on the Thai
soil, he would be extradited to the United States, which had
indicted him on drug-trafficking charges.
</P>
<P>
Several thousand of Khun Sa's troops reportedly broke away last
June after an internal conflict in the leadership.

<HEADLINE> Budget Impasse Seen to Remain Despite Senate Stopgap Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 2 (Xinhua) -- The budget impasse between
the White House and the Congressional Republicans seems unlikely
to end despite the approval of a Senate stopgap bill Tuesday to
return furloughed federal employees to work and pay them.
</P>
<P>
But agreement from the House of Representatives, which isn't
scheduled to meet until Wednesday, is unlikely.
</P>
<P>
House Speaker, Republican Newt Gingrich, said he preferred to
link an end to the 18-day partial shutdown of the federal
government to a final deal to balance the budget.
</P>
<P>
The speaker's spokesman, Tony Blankley, confirmed that the
Senate bill "can't possibly pass the House."
</P>
<P>
House Republican leaders have insisted that the closure helps
them put pressure on Clinton to strike a budget-balancing deal.
</P>
<P>
But there's been a buildup of pressure to bring federal
employees back to work. On Tuesday, several senators, including
Republicans, called for an end to the shutdown, which has affected
workers at nine federal departments and scores of other agencies.
</P>
<P>
Senate Majority Leader, Republican Bob Dole, who sponsored the
bill said people had been away from their jobs long enough. He
denied the legislation signaled any split with Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
"I think the speaker's inclined to be receptive," he said. "I
would hope that we would have quick action. People have been gone
from their jobs long enough."
</P>
<P>
Dole admitted, however, that some House members might disagree
with the bill. "I think there are some House members who have a
different view," he said. "They feel this is helpful in bringing
about a balanced budget. That's not my view."
</P>
<P>
The Senate legislation would return 260,000 idled federal
workers to work immediately, and pay them as well as about 500,000
other civil servants who have been working without pay.
</P>
<P>
The bill was supposed to run through January 12 as budget talks
continue.
</P>
<P>
The Senate also approved an alternative bill that would return
furloughed workers to their jobs but not pay them. That bill would
also approve money for various federal functions, such as
providing meals for the elderly, which would otherwise be halted.
</P>
<P>
Gingrich and other congressional leaders met with President
Bill Clinton and government officials at the White House Tuesday
evening to discuss their conflicting visions of how to balance the
budget by 2002.

<HEADLINE> Mongolia To Auction More State-Owned Properties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Mongolia will auction off
more state-owned properties as part of the country's continued
privatization program, the Capital Privatization Commission said
today.
</P>
<P>
The properties to be auctioned include the State Department
Store, the biggest in the country, the Rainbow Restaurant and the
Moscow Restaurant.
</P>
<P>
Base prices of the properties range from 1.8 billion tugriks
(about 4.5 million U.S. dollars) to 130 million tugriks (about
325,000 dollars), much lower than their original construction
costs, the Commission said.
</P>
<P>
The auctions are aimed at speeding up the government's
privatization drive as the country converts to a market economy.
</P>
<P>
Mongolia is accelerating the privatization of its large and
medium-sized enterprises after the successful sale of small
state-run firms by the end of 1993.
</P>
<P>
So far, nearly 80 percent of the country's state-owned
enterprises have been privatized.

<HEADLINE> Poland Faces Suffocating Foreign Debts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, January 2 (Xinhua) -- The recovery of the Polish
economy is still being hampered by its colossal external debt of
36 billion U.S. dollars, which cost 1.27 billion dollars to
service last year.
</P>
<P>
Poland's external debts, mostly built up during the 1970s under
the governance of Edward Gierek, amounted to 47.9 billion dollars
before 1993.
</P>
<P>
That fell to 42.2 billion dollars in 1994 and to 36 billion
dollars in 1995 when the Paris Club of official creditors and the
London Club of commercial creditors agreed to cut 50 percent of
Poland's public debt and 42.5 percent of its private debt in 1991
and 1994.
</P>
<P>
But in spite of these concessions, a report by the Finance
Ministry predicts Poland will only be able to clear its debt with
the Paris Club by 2014 and will not start paying the principal of
the debt to the London Club until 2001.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts described the external debts as a serious
impediment to the economic development of the country.

<HEADLINE> hke010302--Separation Fuels Competition Among Information Vendors  in Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 3 (Xinhua) -- The separation of global
business information giant Reuters and the Australian Associated
Press (AAP) intensified competition in the local real-time
information market, the Australian Financial Review reported
today.
</P>
<P>
As the AAP and Reuters formally ended their alliance and
BDH041PAB014I03TEQL10:4210:431439
started separate electronic networks last week, other major local
information vendors were quick to seize the opportunity to expand
their customer basis into the 50-percent market shares formerly
held by the AAP and Reuters.
</P>
<P>
The other four providers -- Dow Jones Telerate, Bloomberg,
Knight Ridder Financial and Inforcast -- geared up to net more
customers among the 8,000 to 10,000 electronic business
information users in Australia, most of whom are bankers, stock
brokers and financial officers of big companies.
</P>
<P>
Bloomberg, which runs its closed, proprietary system, is
shifting services onto more open computing platforms.
</P>
<P>
Dow Jones Telerate is considering to put some of its "low-tier"
services on alternative delivery mechanisms, possibly the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
Phil Bradshaw, deputy managing director of Reuters Australia,
said that 1996 would be a year of fierce competition in the local
business information market as the other vendors tend to view the
Reuters-AAP separation as an opportunity to pick up the pieces.
</P>
<P>
Casualties of competition will result from overlap of services
provided by different information vendors.
</P>
<P>
At present, each of the information vendors has its own
specialist advantages in different services. For example, Reuters
boosts its strengths in foreign exchange, while Telerate enjoys a
comfortable edge in interest rates.
</P>
<P>
However, there is still a great deal of overlap of services
among them. For example, both the AAP and Reuters provide
real-time information about trade at the Australian Stock Exchange
(ASX). Users can follow the ups and downs of ASX share prices at
the same time as trade is going on.
</P>
<P>
Users are now seeking to cut cost by reducing overlap of
information services from different providers.
</P>
<P>
The National Australian Bank (NAB) plans to streamline the
number of its information providers from three to two, the
newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
NAB has formed a partnership with the AAP in the past. But the
separation of the AAP and Reuters made it "interesting" to see
what will happen to the AAP, NAB General Manager Jeff Mitchell
said.
</P>
<P>
David Issa, the head of technology for the financial market
group of Westpac Bank, said that the bank chose information
providers on the basis of "the timeliness."
</P>
<P>
But he said that at present, it was not feasible to find one
vendor with all the information. He said that competition among
information vendors would become fiercer as profit margins
continued to shrink in the financial markets.

<HEADLINE> Developing Countries Deeper in Debt in 1994 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Developing countries sank deeper
into debt in 1994 with their foreign debts increasing by a tenth
to 1.714 trillion U.S. dollars, the "biggest growth in recent
years," according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development (OECD).
</P>
<P>
Asian developing countries recorded the fastest growth in
overseas borrowings, with a 17.8 percent rise to 705 billion
dollars, followed by Latin America with 3 percent, the Paris-based
organization said in an annual report published yesterday.
</P>
<P>
But it said Asia's foreign debt per capita of 250 dollars still
accounts for only a fourth of that of debt-laden Latin America.
</P>
<P>
The overall foreign debt of African nations did not increase
due to the extension of payoff periods or debt cancellations.
</P>
<P>
The OECD attributed the sharp increase in developing country
debt mainly to an enormous influx of private capital, which could
be disastrous as the money can be quickly withdrawn when the
creditors lose confidence in the countries.
</P>
<P>
It warned this might lead to a repetition of the 1995 crisis in
Mexico, which in 1994 became the biggest debtor among developing
nations with 125 billion dollars of foreign debts, a tenfold
increase over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The world's top creditors include Japan, which owns 236 billion
dollars in overseas credit or 15 percent of the total credit of
developing countries, America with 147 billion dollars, Germany
with 106 billion and France with 103 billion.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 2 (Xinhua) -- The competitiveness of European
enterprises must be improved to ensure sustained economic
development, a consultative group on competitiveness in the
European Union (EU) has urged.
</P>
<P>
Competitiveness "should be considered as a fundamental means to
improve living standards, create jobs for the unemployed and
eradicate poverty," in the EU, said the group in a report to the
president of the European Commission, Jacques Santer, and heads of
state of EU countries.
</P>
<P>
To improve competitiveness, priority areas for action should
be: reforming infrastructure and public services; supporting
innovative small- and medium-sized enterprises; improving policies
encouraging enterprise development and environmental protection;
redefining and reinforcing education and professional training.
</P>
<P>
The report also appealed for efforts to overcome the
"obstacles" holding back the achievement of a truly unified market.
</P>
<P>
The consultative group, headed by former Italian prime minister
and central banker, Carlo Ciampi, and composed of senior experts,
was entrusted by the EU to study ways of improving the
competitiveness of EU enterprises.

<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, January 2 (Xinhua) -- The 1995 World Track and Field
Championships, which was held in Gothenburg, Sweden in August, has
left the organizers in debt chaos.
</P>
<P>
Peter Smedman, the head of Sweden's Central Office for
Composition and Bankruptcy Proceedings, has been called in as a
consultant to investigate the financial mess of the event.
</P>
<P>
The organizers have so far failed to recover debts of several
million dollars, including more than one million U.S. dollars owed
by the International Amateur Athletics Federation.
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, the championship organization has failed to pay
the city of Gothenburg 3.8 U.S. dollars million, most of which
should have been paid before new year.
</P>
<P>
The city board agreed to wait for its money until Smedman has
sorted out the economics of the championships.
</P>
<P>
Ulf Ekelund, head of the championship organization, went to
Monaco last month to hear when the IAAF will pay its debts.
</P>
<P>
He may get an indication later in January when representatives
for the Iaaf are expected to visit Gothenburg.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think they are intentially withholding the money,"
Ekelund said diplomatically.
</P>
<P>
"I think the IAAF simply feels that the world meet in
Gothenburg is over for them. They have more urgent matters to deal
with now," Ekelund said.

WASHINGTON, January 2 (Xinhua) -- The United States said today
that it believed Saudi Arabia is "in good hands" after King Fahd
handed over the running of the government to his brother Crown
Prince Abdullah on Monday while the king recovers from a stroke.
</P>
<P>
"We understand that he's formally empowered Crown Prince
Abdullah to provide for governance during an interim period as the
king continues to recover," said Glen Davies, deputy spokesman of
the State Department, at a news briefing.
</P>
<P>
Davies said the United States believed the transfer of power to
be "temporary, not permanent." He noted that a similar temporary
transfer of some powers in Saudi Arabia occurred during the late
1980s.
</P>
<P>
"But in terms of the Kingdom and its governance, we think it's
in good and stable hands," Davies added.
</P>
<P>
Davies refused to comment on Abdullah's political attitude
toward the United States, saying that "we were concerned about the
king's health and we wish him a speedy recovery."

<P>
In an interview with the Irish Times newspaper, John Taylor,
UUP's deputy leader, said his party would judge each issue on its
merits.
</P>
<P>
He indicated that UUP would be inclined to support John Major's
government on economic issues while it could find itself opposing
the government's policies on European Union issues.
</P>
<P>
The Tory government's majority in the parliament has been
reduced to five by defection of former Tory parliament member
Emma Nicholson to the Liberal Democrats, the second largest
opposition.
</P>
<P>
And the government is expected to be defeated in two
by-elections in coming weeks, which will cut the Tory party's
majority to one.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the government has to rely on UUP which
enjoys nine seats in the House of Commons for its survival.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Prime Minister John Major has suspended his holiday
to discuss with his closest cabinet colleagues the deepening
crisis within the Conservative party, which could lead to an early
general election, reported the Guardian newspaper today.
</P>
<P>
Senior Tory sources have conceded that Major could be leading a
minority government this year.
</P>
<P>
And this situation could come as early as in summer, with two
by-elections pending and forecasters predicting disastrous results
in the local elections in May, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Syria, Israel to Resume Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Syrian and Israeli
negotiators will resume their peace talks on Wednesday at the Wye
River Conference Center on Maryland's Eastern Shore, the State
Department said here today.
</P>
<P>
The talks, which will be the second round in six months, is
scheduled to last through Friday, Department deputy spokesman Glen
Davies said at a news briefing.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian and Israeli delegations ended the first round of the
three-day talks at the same place last Friday and decided to
continue informal talks in Washington over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
However, the two delegations did not hold any face-to-face
talks during the weekend, U.S. officials said.
</P>
<P>
The officials said "informal consultations" occurred, most
likely in telephone conversations between U.S. special Middle East
envoy Dennis Ross and the two parties.
</P>
<P>
"We are encouraged by what we saw" during last week's
negotiations, Davies said, "We are encouraged that everybody's
coming back tomorrow. And we look forward to further progress."
</P>
<P>
Ross and other three U.S. officials, who attended at the first
round of the talks in Maryland, will continue to participate in
the second round, which will be still closed to press.
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who has no plan to visit
the delegations at Maryland this week, will begin a tour of the
Middle East on January 10, Davies said.

<HEADLINE> Dole Favors Temporarily Returning Furloughed  Employees to Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 2 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Senate Majority Leader
Bob Dole said Tuesday he favors temporarily returning furloughed
federal employees to work and paying them.
</P>
<P>
Dole said, "Some of these good people who work for the
government... live paycheck to paycheck. There aren't too many
wealthy people working for the government."
</P>
<P>
As the partial federal shutdown stretching into its 18th day,
Dole told reporters that one of his ideas about what to do is
sending workers back to their jobs for seven to 10 days while
budget talks between President Bill Clinton and Republican
congressional leaders continue.
</P>
<P>
House leaders had said they would not end the shutdown -- even
temporarily -- until Clinton and the Republicans strike a deal on
balancing the budget by 2002. Until now, Republican leaders in
both chambers have proposed returning the 260,000 furloughed
workers to their jobs without pay until the budget impasse ends.
</P>
<P>
After a one-day New Year's break, budget negotiations are set
to resume Tuesday. Today's meeting is expected to be the first
time the leaders discuss substantial issues.
</P>
<P>
"They are now at a point where they need to begin making
tradeoffs on those issues," White House spokesman Mike McCurry
said, adding he did not expect a major breakthrough today.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile low-paid workers in unfunded agencies are flooding
the non-profit Federal Employee Education and Assistance Fund with
applications for help. The charity provides low-interest loans to
federal workers in normal times and now is providing grants to the
most needy. Executive Director Steve Bauer said the fund is in
danger of going broke.

<P>
LAGOS, January 2 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian defence headquarter
has urged member of the national football team, the Super Eagles,
not to be demoralised by the withdrawal of Nigeria from the 1996
nations cup, scheduled for January 13 in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The director of the defence information, Fred Chijuka, who
made the appeal here today, stressed that the withdrawal was in
the interest of the players.
</P>
<P>
Nigeia announced on December 30 it would pull out of the 20th
Afican Nations Cup because of the serious security concern with
Nigerian players during the competition in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Chijuka said, "the security of our people should be paramount
in the minds of the citizenry."
</P>
<P>
The defence spomesman argued that South Africa should have
given Nigeria a written paper, giving assurance of the safety
of members of the Nigeran team.

<HEADLINE> Clinton May Visit Bosnia in Mid-January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 2 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
may visit U.S. troops enforcing a peace agreement in Bosnia before
his State of the Union speech in late January, the White House
said today.
</P>
<P>
"He wants to go, and he's thinking about when to go and we'll
consult with General (John) Shalikashvili and the secretary of
defense (William Perry) after they return from their trip," White
House spokesman Mike McCurry told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Perry and U.S. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
Shalikashvili will visit Bosnia tomorrow in a whirlwind visit to
the Balkans and the Middle East. During their stay there, the top
U.S. defense officials will meet American ground troops who are
part of the NATO-led 60,000-strong peace implementation force in
the former Yugoslav republic.
</P>
<P>
Asked if a visit by Clinton to Bosnia was possible before the
State of the Union speech reportedly scheduled on January 23,
McCurry said, "It's not out of the question."
</P>
<P>
U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole and other leading
Congressmen have also expressed their desire to visit the American
troops in Bosnia. But the Pentagon has said that they should not
go to the Balkan state before the U.S. troops complete their
deployment.
</P>
<P>
Perry told reporters earlier in the day that the 20,000
American ground troops could complete their deployment in Bosnia
by January 19.

<HEADLINE> UNITA To Resume Troops Assembling Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, January 3 (Xinhua) -- UNITA will soon resume the
assembly of its forces after it suspended the process in early
December 1995, a general of the former rebel movement, Artur
Vinama, announced here today.
</P>
<P>
Vinama made the remarks at the end of the first session of the
joint Angoal military commission, which was set up according to a
decision made at a Angola Peace Commission on January 2 this
year.
</P>
<P>
The military commission will be responsible for dealing with
military problems arising in the peace process, investigating
ceasefire violations and implementing resolutions jointly made
the government and UNITA.
</P>
<P>
UNITA's decision to re-start the assembly process in the near
future has resulted from efforts made by both sides to overcome
the current crisis, Vinama said.
</P>
<P>
The crisis occurred on December 3, 1995, when armed clashes
erupted between the forces of the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA) and government troops near the
northern town of Soyo.
</P>
<P>
The government troops took three UNITA positions during the
clashes, which led to the suspension of the assembly of UNITA
forces the following day.
</P>
<P>
Under the mediation of the United Nations, the government
troops withdrew from the three positions later and
unconditionally released large numbers of UNITA prisoners of war.

<P>
CAIRO, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Newly-named Prime Minister Kamal
al-Ganzouri said this evening that there will be seven to nine new
ministers in the cabinet he is to announce later today.
</P>
<P>
Emerging from a meeting with President Hosni Mubarak at the
presidential headquarters, Ganzouri said he briefed Mubarak on the
formation of the new government, according to the official Middle
East News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The most powerful ministers -- defense, interior and foreign
affairs -- remain in place.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the new cabinet will take the constitutional oath
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
On the assignments of the newly-appointed cabinet, Ganzouri
said these assignments will come in accordance with the statement
of President Mubarak before the People's Assembly session on
December 16.
</P>
<P>
He added that there will be no change in the sovereign
ministries, and no new ministries will be created.
</P>
<P>
Ganzouri was assigned by Mubarak Tuesday evening to form the
new cabinet after the cabinet of Prime Minister Atef Sedki
resigned earlier on the day.
</P>
<P>
Ganzouri, 63, had been deputy prime minister and planning
minister in Sedki's cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Ganzouri graduated from the Faculty of Agriculture of Cairo
University and got a Ph.D degree in economics at the Michigan
University of the United States.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak, after assigning Ganzouri to form the new cabinet, said
Tuesday evening that the change was aimed at "further activation
of the development process."

<HEADLINE> US House Refuses to End Government Shutdown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 3 (Xinhua) -- U.S. House of Representatives
today rejected a move to end the 19-day partial government
shutdown.
</P>
<P>
The vote was 206-167 against an attempt by Democratic Leader
Richard Gephardt to force approval of a measure cleared by the
Senate on Tuesday to reopen federal agencies through January 12.
</P>
<P>
Nearly all Republicans voted to continue the shutdown, and
nearly all Democrats voted to end it.
</P>
<P>
The Senate-passed measure would have reopened the government
for about 10 days, while Republican leaders continue negotiations
with President Clinton on balancing the budget.
</P>
<P>
At the White House, spokesman Mike McCurry said it was being
blocked by Speaker Newt Gingrich, House Majority Leader Richard
Armey.
</P>
<P>
Until today, the White House blamed the shutdown on House
Republican freshmen -- not the leadership.
</P>
<P>
Clinton and congressional leaders planned to resume White House
budget talks today.
</P>
<P>
The administration also planned a series of events, including a
Cabinet meeting this evening, to underscore the impact of the
shutdown.

<HEADLINE> Westinghouse to Sell Defense Business to Northrop  Grumman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Pittsburgh-based Westinghouse
Electric Corp. announced today that it has signed a definitive
agreement to sell its defense and electronic systems business to
Northrop Grumman Corp. for 3 billion U.S. dollars in cash.
</P>
<P>
The deal will help finance Westinghouse's purchase of CBS Inc.
which cost some 5.4 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the Los Angeles-based Northrop Grumman, a
leading defense contractor also will assume 600 million dollars in
pension and other post-retirement costs for employees of the
business.
</P>
<P>
Westinghouse, a broadcasting and industrial conglomerate,
announced in December an agreement to sell the Knoll Group, its
furniture-making subsidiary, for 565 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Westinghouse said the money from the two sales will be used to
pay off more than 65 percent of the 5.4 billion dollars it
borrowed to pay for the acquisition of CBS.
</P>
<P>
The sale is expected to close during the first quarter of the
new year following normal government reviews. Westinghouse will
retain several smaller commercial electronic businesses including
those serving residential security and telecommunications markets.
</P>
<P>
Westinghouse also makes refrigeration equipment, nuclear energy
systems and power generators, and operates government and
electronic systems businesses.
</P>
<P>
The business Northrop Grumman will buy is the largest component
of Westinghouse's Electronic Systems Group, based in Linthicum,
Maryland state. The electronic systems unit employs 14,000 people
and recorded 165 million dollars in operating profit on 2.47
billion dollars in revenue in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Northrop Grumman makes electronics systems, military aircraft
and weapons. Its sales are expected to have reached 6.8 billion
dollars in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Canada, Israel Expected to Sign Free Trade Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Canada is expected to sign a free
trade deal with Israel by June to eliminate tariffs on trade
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"Negotiations are still going on, but we hope to have an
agreement finalized by the middle of 1996," acting Canadian
Ambassador to Israel Eli Yerushalyim was quoted by the Canadian
newspapers as saying today.
</P>
<P>
If the deal is made, Canada will tap into the 3.6 billion U.S.
dollars of Israeli trade now headed to the United States as
American-made products enter Israel duty free. Washington signed
its own free trade agreement with Tel Aviv in 1985.
</P>
<P>
Israel wants the accord to overcome any trade disadvantage it
has in Canada because of the North American Free Trade Agreement
(NAFTA) which groups Canada, the United States and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
Canada's talks with Israel on free trade is part of its efforts
to boost international trade. It agreed with Chile last week to
negotiate a free trade agreement between the two countries without
waiting for the U.S. participation. The deal would serve as a
bridge to Chile's full accession to NAFTA and could give Canadian
companies the jump over U.S. competitors in the fast-growing
Chilean market.
</P>
<P>
International trade is life-blood in Canadian economy, which
amounted to 33.2 percent of gross domestic product in 1994.
Minister for International Trade Roy MacLaren told the Canadian
daily Toronto Star today that the booming export sector is the one
bright spot in an otherwise sluggish Canadian economy.
</P>
<P>
Along with a low dollar, free trade deals are propelling
Canadian trade to new heights, he said. In the first 10 months,
last year, the country's exports grew by 18.4 percent to 209
billion Canadian dollars (one Canadian dollar equals 73 U.S.
cents).
</P>
<P>
The increase included a 16-percent growth in U.S. trade, which
represents 82 percent of all Canada's exports, and a 38.7-percent
and 24.3-percent increase in sales to Europe and Japan,
respectively.

LUANDA, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Angola's processing industry
increased by 16 percent in 1995 over the previous year, the
Ministry of Industry said in a report issued today.
</P>
<P>
The increase, which has topped 10 percent for the first time
since independence in 1975, was achieved against the backdrop of
financial difficulties and massive flow of capital into the trade
sector, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The production of food and beverage rose by 12 percent and 35
percent respectively. Among building materials, the output of
glass and metal materials went up by 19 percent and 10 percent
respectively.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the ministry will take priority in the production of
goods oriented for the home consumer market, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Turkey to Counter Syrian Propaganda on Water </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Turkey declared today that it is
going to brief Arabic and Western envoys on the water issue in
opposition of Syria's attempts to lobby against Ankara's water
policy.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman Omer akbel said that Turkey
would hold briefings on the water issue with Syria and any
diplomats who are interested in the issue could attend the
briefings.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's action comes after massive Syrian attempts vis-a-vis
Arab countries and organizations, some of which have called on
Turkey to sign a "just water accord with Syria" and not deprive
Syria of its rights.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish announcement comes following Egypt and six other
Gulf Arab states sided with Syria last week in its water dispute
with Turkey, urging Ankara to sign a just agreement with Damascus
on sharing the Euphrates's waters.
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministers of the eight countries in Damascus
criticized Ankara for building dams on the river without
consulting with neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
Syria has strongly criticized Ankara's multi-billion-dollar
plan for the construction of a series of dams on the Euphrates,
saying this has led to a sharp decline in the flow of water to
Syria, which uses it for drinking and irrigation.
</P>
<P>
It has called for a permanent water-sharing agreement to
replace a provisional accord under which Ankara allows the flow
of only 500 cubic meters of water per second to Syria.

</P>
<P>
London, along with other European markets, was boosted by the

</P>
<P>
Sign of a solution to the U.S. budget stalemate also helped

<P>
LAGOS, January 3 (Xinhua) -- The International Committee of
the Red Cross (ICRC) says that there are about 6,000 child
soldiers fighting for the various armed factions in the Liberian
civil war.
</P>
<P>
ICRC alleged in the current edition of its magazine "Red Cross
Crescent" that the children being used in the war were being put
under the influence of drugs by their commanders.
</P>
<P>
The children, described as mostly "young uneducated
combatants", gave themselves scary combat names such as "general
snake", "captain double trouble", and "major rambo" among others.
</P>
<P>
ICRC delegate in Monrovia, Liberian capital, Urs Lusser,
warned in the magazine that the rehabilitation and "re-education"
of the children soldiers would be a major challenge in the post war
liberia.
</P>
<P>
The organisation, however, expressed optimism that the peace
agreement signed in August 1995 in Nigerian capital Abuja would
bring the Liberian conflict to an end.
