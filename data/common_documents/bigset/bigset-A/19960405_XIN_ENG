<HEADLINE> Iraq to Resume Oil Talks with UN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, April 5 (Xinhua) -- An Iraqi delegation participating
oil-for-food negotiations with the U.N. will fly to New York
Sunday for a third round of talks, over which the Iraqis are
optimistic for reaching an agreement.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi News Agency said today that the Iraqi delegation,
headed by Abdul Ameer al-Anbari, will resume the talks in New York
Monday with U.N. Secretary General Butros Butros Ghali, who has
recently visited a number of European and Asian countries
including France, China, South Korea and Japan.
</P>
<P>
The agreement on the third round of oil-for-food talks was
reached in a telephone conversion between the U.N. chief, who was
visiting the United Nations' European headquarters in Geneva, and
Iraqi deputy Prime Minister Tareq Aziz.
</P>
<P>
The previous two rounds of talks ended without any accord
because of a dispute on how food and medicine would be distributed
to northern Kurdish regions. A senior Iraqi official said that a
number of problems remain to be ironed out.
</P>
<P>
The two sides discussed technical and banking issues for
exporting oil in the two rounds of talks.
</P>
<P>
Distribution of food and medicine for Kurdish people in
northern Iraq is a thorny issue for negotiators of the two
sides. The three provinces in northern Iraq held by Kurds are
beyond the control of the Iraqi central government after the 1991
gulf war and have been under the protection of the air forces of
the U.S., British and France.
</P>
<P>
Before its oil talks with U.N., Iraq had turned down a
U.N. offer which allows an export of two billion dollars worth of
oil in exchange for humanitarian supplies for Iraq's 20 million
population. Iraq says that some of the offer's terms infringes
upon Iraq's sovereignty.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 5 (Xinhua) -- French Foreign Minister Herve De
Charette, who is accompanying French President Jacques Chirac on
an official visit in Lebanon, held talks here today with his
Lebanese counterpart Fares Boueiz on regional situation.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the talks, Boueiz told reporters that they
exchanged views on a number of matters, first of which was the
latest developments of situation in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
He said that they exchanged views in the light of the recent
developments in Israel, including the the projected Israeli

</P>
<P>
In this regard, the Lebanese foreign minister said, the talks
dealt with a variety of possibilities in the region, including one
in which the Israeli labor Party comes back to power or fails to
come back.
</P>
<P>
During his last visit to Lebanon in November, De Charette
suggested a French participation in proposed security arrangements
in south Lebanon within a framework of a peace agreement
between Lebanon and Israel.
</P>
<P>
The visit is the first by a French president to Lebanon since
its independence in 1943. De Charette stressed earlier today
that Chirac's visit to Lebanon was "very positive" and
constituted a "starting point for launching a new era in the
history of Lebanese-French relations and for activating the
peace process in the region, especially in Lebanon."
</P>
<P>
He stressed France's support for the independence and
sovereignty of Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Chirac arrived in the Lebanese capital on Thursday afternoon
on the first leg of his tour in the region.
</P>
<P>

Nabih Berri, Prime Minister Rafik Al Hariri and made an address

<HEADLINE> Traffic on Le Shuttle Rises 31 Percent in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Eurotunnel, the heavily indebted
Channel Tunnel operator, Thursday announced sharply higher traffic
figures for its Le Shuttle car transport service in March, but
analysts said the figures were flattered by seasonal factors.
</P>
<P>
Eurotunnel said Le Shuttle tourist traffic had doubled in
March, compared with the same month last year, to 152,875 vehicles
and 5,619 coaches. Compared with February, the tourist traffic was
up 31 percent.
</P>
<P>
The traffic figures pushed Eurotunnel's shares up three pence
to 66 pence.
</P>
<P>
Georges-Christian Chazot, Eurotunnel's group managing director,
said the figures were "proof of the growing strength of Le Shuttle
in the cross-Channel market".
</P>
<P>
But analysts said the data were largely meaningless as traffic
would be expected to rise in March every year, particularly when
Easter falls in early April.
</P>
<P>
Eurotunnel suspended interest payments on its eight billion
pounds (12 billion U.S. dollars) last year. It has been locked in
negotiations with its banks ever since.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it has been fighting a fierce battle for market
share with cross-Channel ferry companies.

<HEADLINE> UK Labour Maintains Big Lead over Tories: Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 5 (Xinhua) -- A Gallup poll issued today shows
that Britain's opposition Labour has pulled 3.4 points further
ahead of the ruling Conservatives since February.
</P>
<P>
The poll conducted for the Daily Telegraph newspaper shows that
Labour support moved up during March from 55.4 percent to 57.3
percent, while the Conservative party slipped from 25.4 percent to
23.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
The poll conducted throughout March and based on more than
10,000 interviews tells a central fact that Labour continues to
lead the Tories by roughly 30 points, a margin that Labour has
consistently maintained since Tony Blair succeeded John Smith as
party leader in mid-1994, the Daily Telegraph commented.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said that never before has either major party
been so far ahead of the other, or for so long.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Hopes Lebanon Extend Sovereignty to All Its Lands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 5 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac,
when visiting the multi-national peacekeeping forces in south
Lebanon this afternoon, hoped the Lebanese authority would extend
its sovereignty to all its lands.
</P>
<P>
In the headquarters of the U.N. Interim Force in the southern
Lebanese coastal town of Nagura, Chirac had a meeting with UNIFIL
Commander Maj. Gen. Stanislaw Franciszek Wozniak and other senior
officers in the command.
</P>
<P>
Chirac inspected some positions of the international forces,
especially those of the French contingent.
</P>
<P>
During the inspection, the French president praised the
"important role" the U.N. forces are playing in returning peace to
south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Chirac was the first Western president to visit a southern
Lebanon area in a distance of only several kilometers from the
Israeli border.
</P>
<P>
Chirac noted that his country is ready to contribute to the
peace process "if the parties ask it to do that."
</P>
<P>
He said that the situations in south Lebanon would remain
"inflammable" before the signature of a comprehensive peace
agreement.
</P>
<P>
With an implementation of the U.N. Security Council Resolution
425, the French president hoped the Lebanese army and the
security forces will come to the international border in the South
to keep the peace.
</P>
<P>
After the visit for a couple of hours in south Lebanon, Chirac
came back to the Beirut Presidential Palace later today.
</P>
<P>
Chirac started his official activities on the second day of
his visit in Lebanon by laying a wreath to the Grave of Unknown
Soldiers at Museum Square in Central Beirut.
</P>
<P>
Then, Chirac, accompanied by Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik
Hariri, drove to the building of the former French embassy on
Clemencuau Street in West Beirut, where he presided a ceremony of
signing an agreement on the establishment of a Higher Business
Institute on the site.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed by French Foreign Minister Herve De
Charette and his Lebanese counterpart Farez Boueiz. The Higher
Business Institute will be responsible to supervise French
business activities in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Following the signature, the French president went to Bkirki,
the seat of the Maronite Christian Patriarchate, where he had a
meeting with Maronite Cardinal Nasrallah Butros Sfeir, the
spiritual leader of Lebanon's Marontite community.
</P>
<P>
Chirac also attended a Good Friday Mass conducted by Cardinal
Sfeir.
</P>
<P>
Well-informed sources reported that the closed-door meeting
between Chirac and Sfeir, which lasted some half an hour, dealt
with upcoming parliamentary elections in Lebanon and a
participation of Lebanese Christians in the elections. The
Christians boycotted the previous parliamentary elections in 1992.
</P>
<P>
After the Mass, the French president held an exclusive meeting
with Hariri in the French Embassy in Beirut.

<HEADLINE> Wu Bangguo Encourages Young Skilled Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Wu Bangguo
said today that all Party and government organizations should pay
greater attention to young workers and encourage them in gaining
on-the-job skills.
</P>
<P>
Wu made the remarks at a national meeting on promoting
on-the-job training for young capable persons.
</P>
<P>
The activity to provide on-the-job training for professionals,
initiated by several government departments two years ago, has the
goal of improving the overall quality of young workers.
</P>
<P>
The vice-premier said that 31 million young workers from 2,570
companies across the country have taken part in the activity, and
many have become better qualified workers and made outstanding
contributions, he added.
</P>
<P>
Young workers account for 60 percent of the total workforce and
80 percent of front-line workers, he said. "They are the major
force that drives enterprises' reform and development."
</P>
<P>
He said the Party Central Committee and the State Council have
a great deal of concern for the work of the youth. Chinese
Communist Party General Secretary Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng
have issued instructions related to this on a number of occasions.
</P>
<P>
The trade unions, education departments, and subdistrict
offices should increase efforts at training young employees and
support the Young Skilled Worker activities.
</P>
<P>
Li Keqiang, first secretary of the Secretariat of the Central
Committee of the Communist Young League of China, said that the
activities are an effective way of making use of young labor
resources and helping economic development.
</P>
<P>
Li Boyong, minister of labor, read the awards decisions for
Young Skilled Workers. Gao Guoqiang, a worker in the Shanghai
Petroleum Chemical Industry Corp. Ltd., and nine others received
the Outstanding Young Skilled Worker award, and 200 other persons
were given the Young Skilled Worker award.

<HEADLINE> Toughest Time for Tory Government: Major </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 5 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister John Major
has admitted that the current mad cow scare is the worst crisis to
confront the Conservative government since the Falklands conflict,
according to a report in the Daily Telegraph today.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with David Naish, president of Britain's National
Farmers' Union (NFU), in Downing street, Major said that the beef
crisis caused by the wave of mad cow scare and the EU's worldwide
ban on British beef exports was one of the most difficult
political issue the Tory government has faced in more than 13
years.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the fact that beef sales has sharply declined in
domestic markets and thousands of jobs have been threatened, the
prime minister has decided to direct efforts himself to help the
farming and beef industries.
</P>
<P>
David Naish, a strong pro-European, was bitterly disappointed
that the EU refused to lift its ban on British beef and beef
products even though it had no scientific evidence that there was
any risk to human health.
</P>
<P>
As a leader of British farmers, Naish urged Major that the
priority now must be to restore public confidence in British been
and get consumption moving again.
</P>
<P>
Naish also made clear the the NFU strongly opposed the EU
demand for a cull of selected herds in an attempt to stamp out mad
cow disease and restore confidence in British beef throughout
Europe.

<HEADLINE> 48 Miners Saved After Being Stuck 4 Days In Coalpit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Forty-eight miners were rescued
after having been trapped in a watery coalpit in southwest China's
Guizhou Province for four days and four nights.
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred in Yangliuchong Village, Kaiyang County,
at 10 a.m. on March 28 when a miner happened to dig through the
wall of an abandoned coalpit overhead that was full of water,
which flushed into the mine, spreading quickly into two adjacent
mines.
</P>
<P>
Some of the miners were able to flee the disaster, but the exit
for the others was cut off by the water.
</P>
<P>
Local government officials immediately rushed to the spot to
supervise the rescue operation after getting word of the accident.
</P>
<P>
All 48 of the trapped miners were brought out to safety by 19;00
hours on April 1, and are said to be fully recovered from their
ordeal by hospital officials.
</P>
<P>
The first to be pulled to safety, the 31-year-old Xi Dezhi, said
that he peeled and ate bark from timbers used inside the mine and
straw used for slings. He even had to drink his own urine to avoid
dehydration.
</P>
<P>
Two of the older hands were able to reassure their co-workers
and keep them calm during the ordeal. They showed them how to take
turns at providing light for the well with their miner's lamps and
flashlights, and how to use their safety helmets to remove some of
the water.
</P>
<P>
They also sent several of the sturdier workers to go through
the shaft to try to get help while the others stayed out.
</P>
<P>
Zeng Xingchong, director of the Guiyang City Health Bureau,
said that the miners survived on grass and tree bark, which
unfortunately has almost no nutritional value, but may prove to be
of psychological help and facilitate alleviating hunger pangs.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 5 (Xinhua) -- The unemployment rate in U.S.
edged up to 5.6 percent in March, a slight increase over the rate
in February.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Labor Department reported today that even with the
small rise in the jobless rate, up from 5.5 percent in February,
the U.S. economy appeared to be developing at a faster clip than
late last year.
</P>
<P>
The report said that a survey of business payrolls showed that
U.S. companies added 140,000 jobs in March, down from a revised
increase of 624,000 in February.
</P>
<P>
The increase of jobs in March was concentrated in the service
sector which added 131,000 jobs to the workforce. But the
manufacturing industry laid off 62,000 workers and construction
jobs declined by 13,000 in the month.
</P>
<P>
The huge February increase in jobs, the biggest gain since
1983, triggered a 171-point drop in the Dow Jones industrial
average, the third largest point decline in history. Investors had
worried that the economy was rebounding so quickly that inflation
could become a problem.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Federal Reserve, which had cut interest rates in
December and January in an effort to boost growth, kept the
short-term rates unchanged late last month, believing it has done
enough to keep the country out of a recession.
</P>
<P>
The overall economy, as measured by the gross domestic product,
expanded at a slow rate of 0.5 percent in the last quarter of
1995. Economists said the March increase in jobs is consistent
with their view that the economy in the first three months of this
year grew at a somewhat faster speed of around 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
The unemployment rate of 5.5 percent was well within the narrow
range of 5.4 percent to 5.8 percent where it has been hovering for
the past 18 months.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan to Have More Telecom Links With Rest of World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan will soon have an
additional high-quality telecommunications link to the world
through a submarine optic-fiber cable.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a forum, Chairman of Pakistan Telecommunication
Corporation Limited (PTCL) Mian Javed said Pakistan will be
connected to the world by becoming part of the Southeast
Asia-Middle East-Western Europe cable (SEAMEWE-III).
</P>
<P>
This, he said, will enable Pakistan to provide a high-speed
communications network with the rest of the world, yielding much
better results in transmission of voice, data or video.
</P>
<P>
A memorandum of understanding in this regard has already been
signed with concerned parties, he added.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Pakistan will be linked with an overland optic-fiber
cable connecting Shanghai with Warsaw, through the Central Asian
States.
</P>
<P>
"We have joined the group of Trans-Asia-Europe optic cable
which will connect Pakistan with the Central Asian states through
Chaman near Quetta," the capital of Baluchistan province.
</P>
<P>
However, this could be achieved only when the war in
Afghanistan is over, he added.

<HEADLINE> Ulster People Hope to Ease Tension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 5 (Xinhua) -- More than 200 people in Belfast,
including both Protestants and Catholics, showed unity today by
attending an inter-denominational Good Friday service in the
capital of Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
The open-air service was held in Ormeau Road, Belfast, in
response to rising tension in this area ahead of this year's
"marching season", according to reports from Belfast.
</P>
<P>
In the conflict-torn province, tension is traditionally high
during the "marching season" which continues every year until the
end of August.
</P>
<P>
The marching season is dominated by hundreds of Protestant
marches in country villages and city centers from now on.
</P>
<P>
And Catholic Republicans parade on the Easter weekend and in
mid-August, but they confine themselves to Catholic areas.
</P>
<P>
Trouble occurs almost every year when a few Protestant parades
go through Catholic areas, which are regarded as provocative
sectarian display.
</P>
<P>
This year, the Protestant Apprentice Boys organization has
declared that they would stage "a peaceful protest" next Monday
against a police ban on them parading past Catholic homes in the
Ormeau Road area.
</P>
<P>
People in this area, both Protestants and Catholics, are
worried that Ormeau Road may become a flash-point, particularly,
the Irish Republican Army (IRA) has brought an end to its fragile
ceasefire since February 9, when it restored its bombing campaign.
</P>
<P>
People in the service expressed their desire for easing tension
and for restoring peace.

WASHINGTON, April 5 (Xinhua) -- The Atlanta Olympic Games
organising committee has filed its suit against the designers of
the Olympic stadium for 6 million U.S. dollars due to negligence,
local papers in Atlanta said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The suit goes head-on head against a 4 million case brought up
early against the committee by three design firms which claimed
for compensation for unpaid overtime work.
</P>
<P>
The organisers argued that they need to reinforce the stadium
after a steel fell down last month.
</P>
<P>
Besides, there were "hundreds of additional design errors" for
the 85,000-seat stadium, the local papers said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Paper: U.S. Permitted Iran Arms Shipment for Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Despite a United Nations arms
embargo, U.S. President Bill Clinton secretly gave a green light
to covert Iranian arms shipments into Bosnia in 1994, according to
a published report on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Senior U.S. administration officials told the Los Angeles Times
that the Central Intelligence Agency learned of the arms smuggling
activity through its spy satellites that were trained on the
region.
</P>
<P>
The shipments continued until January of this year, the Times
said. The covert arrangement, which shipped thousands of tons of
small arms, mortars, antitank weapons and other light equipment,
would also have contradicted Clinton's official policy of
isolating Iran as a supporter of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The United States and its West European allies supported the
U.N. embargo as a means of preventing an escalation of the
bloody civil war in the former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
But two top U.S. diplomats, acting on instructions from the
White House and the State Department, told Croatian President
Franjo Tudjman in early 1994 that Washington would not object to
an Iran-to-Bosnia arms pipeline, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
A senor U.S. administration official told the Time that
Clinton directly participated in the decision.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott declined to
comment on the report.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Mike McCurry told reporters that "most
of the matters addressed in this article were addressed long ago."
</P>
<P>
"The United States has always maintained that it upheld the
letter of the law and the requirements of the U.N. Security
Council resolution," McCurry said.

<HEADLINE> Russia Reiterates Position on Cyprus' Demilitarization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 5 (Xinhua) - Russia will work to achieve
the demilitarization of Cyprus and the convocation of an
international conference on the Cyprus issue, Russian ambassador
to Cyprus Boris Zenkov said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after a meeting with Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides,
Zenkov said that during the forthcoming meeting of the five permanent
members of the U.N. Security Council, Russia will "insist on
promoting the demilitarization of Cyprus and the convening of an
international conference on the Cyprus problem."
</P>
<P>
According to U.N. Secretary-General's resident representative in
Cyprus Gustave Feissel, the five permanent members of the U.N.
Security Council will meet in New York on April 17 to try
to work out a concerted approach by all parties involved in an
effort to revive the stalled Cyprus peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The Russian ambassador said that the idea of a demilitarized
Cyprus "heads in the right direction" and that "only a
demilitarized Cyprus can find a just solution".
</P>
<P>
Asked if there is a Russian initiative to push the
stalled Cyprus talks forward, Zenkov said that "we all hope to
find a way out of the present situation. I do not think
any single country can solve a complex problem on her own."
</P>
<P>
"In essence, the Cyprus problem is an issue which concerns
all nations," he added.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Russia's arms sales to the island, Zenkov said
he did not think it proper if Russia were to deny arms sales to
Cyprus to strengthen its defense.
</P>
<P>
"Since we recognize the Republic of Cyprus and we have
had very good ties for years, I do not believe it would be
right to reject a request to meet the legal right of the
Republic of Cyprus to strengthen its defense," Zenkov said.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Cyprus purchased a number of Russian BMP-3
armored vehicles. Moreover, Cyprus has shown interest to buy
Russian tanks and medium range anti-aircraft missile systems
during Cyprus' Defense Minister Costas Eliades' recent visit to
Moscow.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Detect X-Rays From Hyakutake Comet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 5 (Xinhua) -- U.S. and German astronomers
have detected mysterious X-rays emanating from Comet Hyakutake,
which is the first X-rays ever found coming from any comet.
</P>
<P>
The discovery is surprising, the researchers said Thursday,
because a comet is an icy ball of dirt, whereas X-rays -- one of
the most energetic forms of electromagnetic radiation -- are most
often associated with gases heated to a million degrees or more,
such as flares in the Sun, or with violent interactions involving
subatomic particles.
</P>
<P>
The research team used the orbiting German satellite ROSAT --
an X-ray observatory -- to observe the comet repeatedly over six
hours, between March 26 to March 28. The image released Thursday
by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration was taken on
March 27, as the comet passed within 10 million miles of Earth.
</P>
<P>
Computer processing of the ROSAT data determined that the comet
was emitting X-rays about 100 times stronger than anyone had ever
predicted. Scientists were also surprised by the pronounced
increases and decreased in the X-ray brightness from one
observation to another, typically over a few hours.

JERUSALEM, April 5 (Xinhua) -- The military leadership of Iz
Al-Din Al-Qassam, military branch of the Islamic Resistance

</P>
<P>
According to a report of JMCC, a Palestinian press service
based in east Jerusalem, the Hamas militants were responding to a
recent initiative put forward by national and Islamic figures to
mediate between the PA and Hamas.
</P>
<P>
The mediators, who will go to Jordan Saturday for a meeting

Marwan Barghouti and Imad Falouji. The Israeli authorities have
reportedly expressed an approval of the trip by the delegation
explaining that stability in the territories is in the interests
of Israel.
</P>
<P>
However, the Hamas militants said in the leaflet that they
utterly reject, and will not agree in any manner, to conduct any
dialogue whatsoever with the PA unless the conditions are met.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, they demand that the PA totally
end what they called "all terrorist measures" practiced by the
PA against Hamas and its military wing.
</P>
<P>
They also demand a release of detainees of all Islamic groups
from the PA prisons. The PA should also "try all the
persecutors responsible for torturing Hamas and Al-Qassam heroes
in the authority's jails and interrogation cells," they said.
</P>
<P>
The militants said that PA President Yasser Arafat "has to
read an official statement at a press conference including an
official apology for all terrorist measures and ugly crimes
committed by the authority's henchmen against the Islamic
Movement's members."

TIANJIN, April 5 (Xinhua/OANA) -- World record holder Lin Li
was edged by Wu Yanyan, an 18-year-old entry from Guangxi, and had
to settle for the silver in her specialty of 200m individual
medley here on Friday at the China's Champions' meet.
</P>
<P>
Wu, gold medalist of the event at the Urban Games in Nanjing
last October, rallied from behind to surpass Lin in the final 50
meters.
</P>
<P>
Wu clocked two minutes 12.87 seconds, just 1.22 seconds adrift
from the world mark set by Lin at the Barcelona Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
Wu's time was also this year's fastest, bettering American
Allison Wagner's former best of 2:13.71 at the U.S. Olympic trials
in Indianapolis in March.
</P>
<P>
"I was confident with myself. The time is not a surprise for
me," said Wu, a 1.73-meter girl, after the final. "I was not
nervous at all."
</P>

His clocking was nearly one second behind his own best of

<HEADLINE> Overseas Students Urged to Contribute to China's Hi-tech Research </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Speaking at a national meeting on the country's hi-tech
research plan, Program 863, State Councillor Song Jian said there
are many Chinese students doing hi-tech research, and that a
number of them should be invited to return to China to lead the
work in their area of specialization.
</P>
<P>
They deserve better working and living conditions, Song told
nearly 300 scientists and science officials at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
China has sent 220,000 students abroad in the past two decades,
and 75,000 have already returned to China, with many of them
playing major roles in research and teaching.
</P>
<P>
Song said attention should be paid to training young talented
people to be the driving force behind new theories, new methods,
and new products, and preferential treatment is needed to
encourage cities to provide better working and living conditions
to outstanding young scientists.
</P>
<P>
They should also be promoted to leading positions, he said,
"The average age of science officials should be lowered gradually,
as should that of those working in research and development
institutions."
</P>
<P>
Professor Chen Zhangliang, who is not yet 40, returned from the
United States and was appointed last year vice-president of
Beijing University.
</P>
<P>
Twenty young scientists, nearly half of whom had returned from
abroad, were selected earlier this year by the Chinese Academy of
Sciences as candidates for its "100 Leading Scientists Program."
</P>
<P>
Each of the candidates will be eligible for a maximum of two
million yuan in aid for launching research programs and improving
living conditions.
</P>
<P>
Program 863 has led to breakthroughs in hi-tech research
projects, narrowing the gap between China and the developed
countries. A part of the program, the country's most advanced
program-controled telephone switchboard and the Dawn 1000 parallel
processing computer, the most powerful computer in China, which
has a maximum speed of 2.5 billion calculations per second, were
designed mostly by young scientists, the state councillor noted.
</P>
<P>
A total of 10 billion yuan was earmarked for this "Hi-tech
Research and Development Program," and about 1,200 research
findings have been made in the fields of bio-technology,
information science, automation, energy, and new materials, 560 of
which are in the forefront and 244 have been patented both in and
outside China.

<HEADLINE> South Korea Reacts to DPRK's Decision on Demilitarized Zone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, April 4 (Xinhua) -- South Korea said today that
Pyongyang is trying to unilaterally scrap the 1953 Armistice
Agreement by giving up its duty to maintain the status of the
demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the North and South.
</P>
<P>
But Seoul said in a statement that there is no need for the
South to take new counter-measures because the country's armed
forces have maintained a state of readiness for war since winter
1995.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK)
announced in a statement that it will no longer maintain and
control the DMZ and the demarcation line because South Korea
violated its status as stipulated in the armistice.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK said the South had turned the DMZ, a buffer zone under
the armistice, into an "armed zone" by bringing many tanks,
artillery pieces and other heavy weapons into the zone and
deploying a large number of troops there.
</P>
<P>
The statement, issued at the village of Panmunjom in the DMZ,
also said DPRK troops and vehicles entering the joint security
area around Panmunjom and the zone will no longer use distinctive
insignia and markings.
</P>
<P>
Hours after Pyongyang's announcement, South Korean Deputy Prime
Minister and National Unification Board Minister Kwon O-kie
convened an emergency meeting and released a statement through the
Defense Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the armistice agreement cannot be
replaced or revised unilaterally and should be respected until a
lasting peace mechanism is agreed by the two sides of the Korean
Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
"We urge North Korea to stop trying to destroy the armistice
agreement and join in efforts to promote peace and national
reconciliation by returning to the armistice-managing
organization," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The demilitarized zone, 241 kilometers long and four kilometers
wide, was established by the armistice agreement that ended the
Korean War in 1953. The zone stretches roughly along the divide
between the North and the South when the war began in 1950. A
joint security area of about 1 square kilometer was also
established around Panmunjom under the agreement.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Lifts Ban on Leather Imports From 4 European Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Turkey today announced to lift a
ban on leather imports from Ireland, Switzerland, France and
Portugal, the semi-official Anatolia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Agricultural Minister Ismet Attila said in a written
statement that only the ban on the original cow leather imports
from Britain will continue.
</P>
<P>
Starting from March 27, the Turkish agriculture ministry has
forbidden all animal product imports from Britain, Ireland,
Switzerland, France and Portugal in view of concern about the mad
cow disease.
</P>
<P>
But on Wednesday, officials of Turkey's leather goods sector
condemned as "exaggerated" the ban on leather imports from the
five European countries because of the disease.
</P>
<P>
Turkey processes about 80 million leather skins a year. About
half of the 60 million skins imported annually come from
countries falling under the ban.

<HEADLINE> "Black Economy" Runs Rampant in Hungary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Hungary's rampant "black economy"
accounted for one third of the gross national product (GNP) last
year and cost the government 100 billion forints (about 680
million U.S. dollars) in revenue losses.
</P>
<P>
Undergound production and distribution constituted 22 percent
of Hungary's GNP in 1992 and soared to a record 33 percent in
1995, according to local press reports.
</P>
<P>
A quarter of the country's daily necessities are produced and
distributed without government regulation.
</P>
<P>
Economic crimes are also on the rise as more and more people
are engaging in the "black economy," the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Hungarian economists attribute the flourishing "black economy"
to high inflation, falling real income and rising unemployment in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
Beneze Jozsef, economic advisor to Prime Minister Gyula Horn,
has said many times that Hungary's recovery from its current
economic crisis depends on the success of measures taken by the
government to combat the "black economy."

Speaking at a meeting on the country's "Hi-tech Research and
Development Program", Program 863, Song said, "Program-controled
telephone switchboards developed by the Chinese now account for 36
percent of the domestic market."
</P>
<P>
"The State Meteorological Bureau managed to buy a super
computer from the U.S.'s Cray at a time when only two processors
were allowed, several years ago. Now we have developed a more
powerful computer, the Dawn 1000, which has a maximum speed of 2.5
billion calculations per second," Song told nearly 300 scientists
and science officials at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The developed nations have been banning exports of "sensitive"
hi-tech goods, such as the most advanced program-controlled
machines or most advanced computers, to China for the past several
decades.
</P>
<P>
"In the past five years, China has developed high-performance
program-controlled telephone switchboards," the official said,
"Our achievements in hi-tech research are encouraging, and have
made us more confident of realizing our modernization goals."
</P>
<P>
A total of 10 billion yuan was earmarked for Program 863, which
has led to some breakthroughs in hi-tech research projects,
narrowing the gap between China and other parts of the world.
About 1,200 developments in the fields of bio-technology,
information science, automation, energy, and new materials have
been made, 560 of which are on the cutting edge of their fields
and 244 have been patented both in and outside China.
</P>
<P>
Success has been made in improved strains of rice and cotton,
animal and plant gene transplanting, genetic-engineering,
pharmaceuticals and vaccines, massive parallel processing
computers with a speed of 2.5 billion calculations per second,
underwater robots, and robots for manufacturing.

<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Rover automobile company,
which was planning to manufacture Rover-Maestro cars with a
Bulgarian partner, suspended investment in Bulgaria on Thursday
because of what it called the lack of support from local
authorities.
</P>
<P>
Rover executives said that they had done what they could to
make cooperation possible, but their efforts had been thwarted by
the uncooperative attitude of local authorities toward important
aspects of the joint venture.
</P>
<P>
Local press reported that the joint venture, the biggest ever
between Bulgaria and a Western country, began eight months ago and
aimed to produce about 10,000 cars a year for the east European
market.
</P>
<P>
The Rover-Maestro model which Rover produces in partnership
with Bulgaria's Rodakak company has won the silver prize at an
international car exhibition.
</P>
<P>
Some reports attributed the breakup of the partnership, at
least partially, to pressures from Rover's Russian and South
Korean rivals which have been scrambling for a larger share of the
car market in eastern Europe.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Pilgrims to Hold Demonstrations Against US in Saudi Arabia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Iran declared here today its
pilgrims will stage political demonstrations against the United
States and Israel during the forthcoming Haj rituals in the holy
places in Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
The statement was made by Mohammad Reyshahri, head of Iranian
Haj pilgrims and representative of Iranian Supreme Leader Ali
Khamenei.
</P>
<P>
Iran's official news agency IRNA reported that 78,000 Iranian
pilgrims will leave for Mecca and Medina on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of Iranian pilgrims' departure for Medina to perform
this year's Haj rituals, Reyshahri said that proclaiming to the
world of the cry of the oppressed and also voicing fury against
the arrogant were among some of the main responsibilities of
Iranian pilgrims.
</P>
<P>
He said that such slogans as "down with the arrogance" and
"down with the criminal U.S." were the slogans of all freedom
lovers around the world.
</P>
<P>
But the outcry of such slogans beside the house of monotheism
had a profound implication.
</P>
<P>
Haj rituals should serve as a means for globalization of Islam
and should be the source for a universal rising of the Moslem
world against the United States, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that if Iranian pilgrims hold political
demonstrations against the United States and Israel in Mecca,
tension will arise not only in Mecca and Medina but also in
relations between Iran and Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi government banned all political activities during the
pilgrimage. After the Islamic revolution in Iran in 1979,
Iranian pilgrims insisted on staging political demonstrations and
rallies at the occasion.
</P>
<P>
The pilgrimage every year reminds the people of bloody Mecca
incident on July 31, 1987, which led to thousands of deaths and
injuries.
</P>
<P>
Some 320 Iranians were killed in the incident when
thousands of Iranian pilgrims clashed with Saudi police in a
political demonstration near the ground mosque in the holy city
of Mecca.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Manila to Deregulate Oil Industry  (by Xiong Changyi) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 5 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government will
implement the full deregulation of the oil industry this year if
the required environment is in place.
</P>
<P>
According to the Oil Industry Deregulation Act signed into law
by President Fidel Ramos last week, such deregulation would
largely depend on the competition and behavior of crude oil prices
in the world market.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Energy Secretary Francisco Viray said that
the government is doing everything to establish a competitive
environment in the industry, which he considers a critical
condition to full oil deregulation.
</P>
<P>
The scheduled deadline for the implementation of the second and
final phase of deregulation is set by March 1997.
</P>
<P>
The deregulation bill states that the Department of Energy
(DOE) should start implementing the full deregulation at a time
when the prices of crude and petroleum products in the
international market are softening and when the peso-dollar
exchange rate is stable.
</P>
<P>
Viray said that he was confident the government will be able to
attract a good number of investors in the industry and create a
competitive environment before the March 1997 deadline.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Central Bank Governor Gabriel Singson said that the
oil industry deregulation act will end 25 years of strict
government controls over the prices of oil products and will
attract foreign and local investments in the oil industry.
</P>
<P>
In turn, he said that more participants in the oil industry
will encourage competitive prices to the benefit of the general
public.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that the safety net provisions of the law will
help prevent any possible cartelization and other acts of unfair
trade in the oil industry.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 5 (Xinhua) -- American players Pete Sampras and
Michael Chang will play in the Salem Open tennis tournament
starting in Hong Kong on Saturday, organizers said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Sampras, who was ranked second with just 160 points behind
Austria's Thomas Muster in the latest ATP rankings, will reduce
the margin to within 10 points should he win the event.
</P>
<P>
Chang also needs a win in the 328,000 U.S. dollar event to
consolidate his fourth-ranked place against German Boris Becker,
who is merely 65 points behind.
</P>
<P>
Despite his win-loss slate of 5-7 against Sampras, an in-form
Chang could stand a better winning chance in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Chang, runner-up at Australia Open, beat Paul Harrhuis of the
Netherlands in the final of the Champions Cup last month, the
first of the ATP "Super 9" events of the year.
</P>
<P>
Pete Sampras, who was huanted by injuries and saw his
performance fluctuated recently, fell to Harrhuis in the Champions
Cup quarter-finals.
</P>
<P>
China's Pan Bin, who never entered the second round in the past
three editions, will play as a wild card.
</P>
<P>
The final is slated on April 14 in Victoria Park in Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> Teahouses Popular Again in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 5 (Xinhua) -- After the onslaught of coca-cola
and coffee that was all the rage in China, the traditional Chinese
drink -- the humble cup of tea -- has made a comeback becoming the
favorite for some in China's largest metropolis.
</P>
<P>
More young people are taking to tea instead of the fashionable
soft drink cans, and the number of teahouses has grown to more
than 3,000.
</P>
<P>
Many provide a cultured atmosphere, combining tea service with
poetry, books, and paintings or with a Western flavor, though some
provide other performances and some are equipped with Karaoke
equipment, targeting the youth culture.
</P>
<P>
They're found in almost all of Shanghai's main streets. Hotels
and restaurants are also providing tea service, bringing in tea
drinkers during the holidays and days off.
</P>
<P>
Teahouses are often occupied by the elderly in the morning, who
usually come to have a chat with old friends, neighborers and
colleagues. To their surprise, however, young women are also
coming to frequent the teahouses.
</P>
<P>
"I find that tea has more flavors than most other drinks," said
a young business man, Mr. Li, "I like to go to the teahouses where
I feel more relaxed, and can make a lot of friends."
</P>
<P>
China has the world's largest amount of land planted in tea,
and produces 550,000 tons of it each year, ranking second in the
world. The annual amount of tea consumed by Chinese has been
increasing steadily in recent years. Per capita consumption for
the 13 million Shanghai residents has risen to more than 500g.
</P>
<P>
The tea vogue has made tea a popular gift in Shanghai. The
sales volume of various kinds of tea and things to go along with
it has been increasing rapidly, being purchased sometimes for
private collections or for ornamental purposes.

<TEXT>
<P>
Beijing, April 5, (Xinhua)-- People in Shanghai have been able
to get away from that sinking feeling!
</P>
<P>
Earth subsidence has been effectively brought under control in
China's biggest city during the past year.
</P>
<P>
Reports show that the urban area subsided about 9.44 mm last
year -- 0.6 mm slower than the year before.
</P>
<P>
Last year 148 million cubic meters of underground water was
drawn in Shanghai, with 21.4 million cu m of tap water returned,
the net amount of exploited groundwater slightly less than in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai Public Municipal Bureau says that strict control will
be continually taken on the digging of new wells.
</P>
<P>
To control earth subsidence more effectively the Bureau will
take more steps to replace underground water with purified ground
water.

<HEADLINE> Israel Remains On Full Alert Over Passover Holiday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 5 (Xinhua) -- The security forces are showing
no signs of slackening their high alert over the weekend against
possible attacks by Islamic militants although the first day of
the 8-day Passover Holiday passed peacefully Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The army has beefed up its patrols along the Gaza Strip and
reinforced roadblocks in the West Bank. The security forces have
also arrested more Hamas and Islamic Jihad activists and
supporters, most recently in Harath a-Sheik in the Hebron region.
</P>
<P>
They sealed the home of the man who recruited the two Hamas
suicide bombers who blew themselves up on a Jerusalem bus and at
an Ashkelon hitchhiking post.
</P>
<P>
Early Wednesday, troops moved into the Fawar refugee camp near
Hebron and shut the home of Mohammed Abu Warda. Palestinian
Preventive Security is holding Abu Warda, who allegedly organized
the suicide bombings while he was a student at a U.N.-run college
in Ramallah.
</P>
<P>
The army has recently blown up two homes in the crowded
refugee camp. The first belonged to Ibrahim Sarahna, the suicide
bomber who killed one person and wounded 31 during Ashkelon
bombing on February 25.
</P>
<P>
A few days later, the army partially demolished the home of the
family of Abu Warda's cousin Majid, who blew himself up on
Jerusalem's No.18 on the same day, killing 25 people.
</P>
<P>
After his arrest on March 4, Mohammed Abu Warda told Israel
Television that he had been asked to be a suicide bomber himself,
but he refused, recruiting two others instead. Abu Warda was
sentenced to life imprisonment with hard labor.

<HEADLINE> Britain, France to Create World's Biggest Sonar Company </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 5 (Xinhua) -- The British and French governments
have agreed to create the world's largest sonar company by merging
their existing sonar-system businesses.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Thomson-CSF of France and GEC-Marconi of
Britain will pool their three underwater monitoring businesses
into a joint venture named Thomson Marconi Sonar (TMS).
</P>
<P>
The company will be owned by 50.1 percent by Thomson and 49.9
percent by GEC-Marconi and it will have operating centers in
France, Britain and Australia.
</P>
<P>
Its annual sales are estimated at around 360 million pounds
(about 540 million U.S. dollars) and it will employ 3,500 workers.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for GEC-Marconi said "TMS will build on the
respective strengths of its two shareholders to secure European
and world market leadership in sonars."
</P>
<P>
The new joint venture will provide sonar systems, which use
sound waves to track, chart and identify underwater activity and
installations, for surface ships, submarines, aircraft and mine
warfare.
</P>
<P>
The British and French governments have asked the European
Commission (EC) not to scrutinize the deal on grounds of national
security.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the British Department of Trade and Industry
was reported as saying that the two governments feel it "would not
be appropriate for the military aspects of the transaction to be
notified to or considered by the EC under the current European
Union merger regulation."

<HEADLINE> HK Future Success Needs Support from its Young People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 5 (Xinhua) -- China is placing its hope for the
future success of Hong Kong on its young people, a leading Chinese
official said in Being tonight.
</P>
<P>
 Wang Zhaoguo, vice-chairman of the National Committee of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), spoke
about the important part that young people will play when he met a
delegation from the China-HK Economic and Trade Association. The
delegation was led by its Managing Director Eddy. S.H. Li.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that maintaining Hong Kong's prosperity and stability
and its position as a financial, trade, shipping and information
center, was vital not only for Hong Kong itself, but also for the
economic growth of the entire country.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the Hong Kong people from all walks
of life will make unremitting efforts to this end.
</P>
<P>
Wang, also head of the United Front Work Department of the
Chinese Communist Party Central Committee, appreciated the efforts
that the China-HK Economic and Trade Association has made in
promoting economic cooperation and trade between the two places,
and their personnel training, as well as the exchange of
experiences.
</P>
<P>
He noted that most of the delegation members are young people,
adding: "we place our hopes on the young people, and Hong Kong's
future belongs to its young people too."
</P>
<P>
"I am confident that the association will contribute more to
Hong Kong's smooth transition," he added.
</P>
<P>
Wang said the delegation's arrival in Beijing had come shortly
after the two sessions of China's National People's Congress and
the CPPCC National Committee.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he said that the time was good for the Hong Kong
delegation to seek good opportunities for investment in the
country during its visit to Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Eddy S.H. Li said that how to use talented Hong Kong people to
serve the country after 1997 was an important topic that the
association is studying.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Li said that he would raise some suggestions
on the issue.
</P>
<P>
After their arrival on Thursday as guests of the Chinese
Federation of Industry and Commerce, the Hong Kong entrepreneurs
attended a seminar on opportunities for developing economic ties
and trade between the Chinese mainland and Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> Manila to Recover 70 Percent Revenue Losses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 5 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government is
expecting to recover at least 70 percent of the revenue losses due
to the shift of customs valuation from home consumption value to
transaction value through higher volume of imports.
</P>
<P>
Finance Secretary Roberto de Ocampo said today that contrary to
newspaper reports, the revenue loss of the shift to export value
is 2.9 billion pesos (116 million US dollars) for 1996 while the
annual revenue loss thereafter is 6.2 billion pesos (248 million
US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The shift in the basis of customs valuation from home
consumption value to transaction value is mandated under a
republic act, which was signed into law by President Fidel Ramos
last week.
</P>
<P>
The finance secretary said that compensating for the revenue
losses, the shift will lower the costs of imported inputs for
domestic industries and local exporters, resulting in lower prices
and greater variety of goods available to consumers.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said, it will enable the country's exporters to
compete more effectively in the global export market.

<HEADLINE> Mahathir Says Ties Not Affected By Hayden's Words </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad said here today that relations between Malaysia
and Australia will not be affected by the remarks of Australia's
former governor-general Bill Hayden.
</P>
<P>
According to reports here, Bill Hayden said last Tuesday that
Mahathir and the Malaysian government adopted a racial
discrimination policy in the country.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said: "This is a statement by a frustrated politician.
 I will not allow such frustrated people to sour our ties with the
new Australian government."
</P>
<P>
Malaysian-Australian relations have improved recently after
Mahathir met with his Australian counterpart John Howard in
Brisbane where Mahathir stopped over after his official visit to
New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
Hayden's remarks have been severely criticized by Malaysian
public opinions. Some political party leaders said Hayden's
statement was "irresponsible", and others said it was a
"ridiculous statement by a ridiculous person."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Australian government has distanced itself from
the remarks by Hayden. Australian Foreign Minister Alexander
Downer said on Wednesday that his government did not share
Hayden's views and that the latter spoke as a private citizen
only.

<P>
XIAN, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Giant Pandas are playing happy
families in a natural animal kingdom in China's Shaanxi province.
</P>
<P>
More than 200 of the famous bears, and 60 crested ibis are
living in perfect harmony in the province's Hanzhong Prefecture.
</P>
<P>
Officials say that compared to the past the animals are all
having growing families.
</P>
<P>
The number of crested ibis increased by 13 last year, three of
them were bred by artificial means. In 1981 there were only seven
crested ibis.
</P>
<P>
Hanzhong Prefecture, located at the base of the Qinling
mountain range and Bashan mountain, boasts various kinds of
animals, including more than 300 species of birds, over 100
species of beasts, more than 40 species of amphibious animals, and
109 kinds of fish, accounting for 80 percent of the total rare
wild animal species in Shaanxi.
</P>
<P>
The region is the only place in the world where wild crested
ibis group can be found.
</P>
<P>
Publicity has been widely used in the area to make people more
aware of animal protection, and special organizations have been
established to form an animal protection network. It means that
the human neighbors of the animal kingdom are helping to provide a
better ecological and social environment for the wildlife.

<HEADLINE> Sacred Lake Becomes New Attraction for Tourists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, April 5 (Xinhua) -- The Lhamlaco Lake in Tibet has
become a new tourism attraction since a lake observation was
carried out there in the search for the reincarnation of the 10th
Panchen Lama.
</P>
<P>
Lake observation, like divination and lot-drawing from a gold
urn in front of the portrait of Sakyamuni, was an indispensable
step in determining the reincarnated child of a deceased Dalai
Lama or Panchen Lama.
</P>
<P>
The lake is located in Cyaca County in southern Tibet, where
the Second Dalai Lama Goindun Gyaico had lived, and thus became a
mythical sacred place in Tibetan Buddhism.
</P>
<P>
In 1509, the Dalai Lama built the Qunkorgai Monastery,
belonging to the Gelupa Sect of Tibetan Buddhism, and made the
Lhamlaco a sacred lake.
</P>
<P>
There are now more than 30 lamas in the monastery.
</P>
<P>
In summer and autumn seasons, various flowers are in full
blossom around the monastery, and sheep gambol on pastures like
white clouds.
</P>
<P>
The lake situated over 5,000 meters above sea level is just
like a sapphire inlaid in the slope.
</P>
<P>
Natives say that at times of clear weather, one may be lucky
enough to see mirages appear on the lake.
</P>
<P>
Lobsang, a driver who went with the searching team for the
reincarnated boy of the 10th Panchen Lama, said: "I went to the
sacred lake more than 80 times only last year, sending pilgrims
and foreign tourists."
</P>
<P>
Statistics from local tourism departments show that last year
more than 10,000 domestic and foreign tourists paid visits to the
Lhamlaco Lake.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Army Retrenched </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Uganda's army has been reduced
from about 100,000 troops between 1986 and 1991 to this year's
50,000, reported the local newspaper "The Monitor" today.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the Defence Ministry on Thursday was
quoted as saying that the reduction was done in accordance with
the army retrenchment exercise launched in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan government army took over security work in 1986,
when the police had virtually collapsed amid the rising
insurgency in northern part of the country.
</P>
<P>
In such circumstances, the government had to keep a 100,000 or
so-strong army between 1986 and 1991, the statement said, adding
the army retrenchment would make the country's military better
trained, equipped and prepared for their future tasks.
</P>
<P>
The statement reassured that Uganda has stopped production of
landmines and is, instead, to manufacture rifle-propelled
grenades at its military hardware factory in the northern part of
the country.
</P>
<P>
Uganda first announced the ending of production of mines two
years ago in response to world wide appeals. Tanzania and
Zimbabwe have also banned the production of mines.

<HEADLINE> When Did Chinese Put Shoes on Horses? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, April 5 (Xinhua) -- A picture in world-renowned
Dunhuang grottos has given a clue to when the Chinese began to put
shoes on their horses.
</P>
<P>
Scholars have long been puzzled about the precise date because
of the lack of historical records.
</P>
<P>
Previously the experts thought that the nailing on horseshoes
occured as early as in the Tang Dynasty (618-907), based on
related descriptions in poems.
</P>
<P>
But a piece of Sui Dynasty (581-618) wall paintings, in the
Mogao Grottos in Dunhuang in north China's Gansu Province, has
shown that the Chinese put shoes on their horses at least 1,380
years ago.
</P>
<P>
Listed as a world heritage site, the grottos has some 45,000 sq
m of wall paintings made during the period from the Northern
Dynasties (386-581) to the Western Xia Dynasty (1038-1227).
</P>
<P>
The picture is one of some 80 pieces of wall paintings found in
the grottos which contribute to the study of Chinese history of
science and technology, especially of agriculture.
</P>
<P>
According to Wang Jinyu, a research fellow from the Institute
of Dunhuang, these wall paintings depict scenes on ploughing,
sowing, weeding, winnowing, reaping, stock raising, and fishing.
</P>
<P>
Tens of kinds of tools can be found in the paintings, including
adjustable ploughs, rakes, spades, steelyards, and mills.
</P>
<P>
Some twenty different kinds of trees, mostly fruit trees, can
also be found in the wall paintings.
</P>
<P>
"The wall paintings can be called a vivid history of
agricultural science and technology," Wang says.

JERUSALEM, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Foreign Minister Ehud

summit.
</P>
<P>
Despite foreign reports about nuclear reactors in Israel,
Israel itself has not admitted such existence.
</P>
<P>
Egypt insists Israel sign the NPT, and Israel's refusal to
sign on the extension treaty of the NPT last year strained
relations between the two countries.

Meanwhile, Barak also told Bassiouny that Israel expects Egypt
to be a leader in the process of normalization between Israel and
the Arab world, and not to exacerbate Israel's relations with
Arab countries.

CHANGSHA, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Teenage schoolboy Yang Kai is
walking tall in his home city in central China's Hunan province.
</P>
<P>
The 15 year old, who was born in Changde city, has already
reached a height of 1.93 meters ... and he is still growing.
</P>
<P>
Yang dwarfs his father, a worker at a meat company, who is
just 1.80 meters tall. The boy's mother, who is 1.68 meters, works
at a department store.
</P>
<P>
Local doctors said that Yang's especially tall height has a
close connection with genetic factors of his parents.
</P>
<P>
Yang has a big appetite. He usually eats 200 grams of beef,
ten deep-fried twisted dough sticks (weighing 500 grams), and
drinks a cup of milk for breakfast, and he eats 500 grams of
cooked rice for lunch.
</P>
<P>
Several examinations have proved that Yang has a good nutrition
and he will be taller, if he eats more nutritious foods, according
to local doctors.
</P>
<P>
Yang is open-minded, talkative, and has a wide-range of
hobbies. He is earnest with studies, and is happy to help others.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, Belarussian Foreign Ministers Hold Talks in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign
Minister Qian Qichen said in Beijing today that China attaches
great importance to its relations with Belarus, and regards it as
"a good friend and a good partner."
</P>
<P>
In his talks with visiting Belarussian Foreign Minister
Vladimir Senko at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse, Qian said China
is willing to develop long-term, stable and friendly ties of
cooperation with Belarus, on the basis of all the principles of
peaceful co-existence.
</P>
<P>
He expressed a welcome to Senko for his visit, saying this will
give impetus to the development of bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
"China and Belarus established diplomatic ties soon after
Belarus gained independence," Qian noted.
</P>
<P>
The visit to Beijing by Belarussian President Alexander
Lukashenko in early 1995, and Chinese Premier Li Peng's visit to
Minsk later that year, had heralded a new era in bilateral
relations, he said.
</P>
<P>
Qian said Belarus, during the worldwide anti-fascist war, had
made great contributions and sacrifices. As a founding member of
the United Nations, and "an important country in Europe," Qian
said, Belarus is playing a positive role in the international
arena.
</P>
<P>
He said the two countries have common interests, instead of
fundamental conflicts and political barriers.
</P>
<P>
"Developing bilateral ties accords with the fundamental
interests of the two peoples, and will be beneficial to regional
and world peace and stability," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Senko thanked Qian for his hospitable invitation. He said the
leaders of Belarus paid immense attention to developing ties with
China, which holds an important position in Belarus' foreign
affairs.
</P>
<P>
As to bilateral economic and trade relations, the two foreign
ministers pledged continued joint efforts to expand and upgrade
their cooperation in the field.
</P>
<P>
Senko said Minsk will unswervingly adhere to the position
affirmed in the statement on establishing Belarussian-Chinese
diplomatic relations, and uphold the policy of "one China."
</P>
<P>
Qian expressed thanks for Belarussian government's stand of
"one China", and its refusal to form any official links with
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
After the talks, the two foreign ministers signed a protocol on
news cooperation between their ministries.

<HEADLINE> He's Coach: Lack of Competitions Causes Failure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Wang Lin, coach of the women's 100
meters backstroke world record holder He Cihong, finally stopped
the media lock-out on Friday, saying that lack of the major
international competitions appearance was the main reason for He's
failure at the China Champion's tourney.
</P>
<P>
He, who set the world mark of 1:00.16 at the Rome World
Championships in 1994, was edged into the runner-up in Wednesday's
final of 100m backstroke. She clocked 1:02.98, 2.92 seconds
slower than her own best.
</P>
<P>
A 17-year-old Chen Yan, from Jiangsu Province, chalked up the
title.
</P>
<P>
He, Asian record holder in the 100m and 200m backstroke events,
said that she had tried her best.
</P>
<P>
"This time is a `catastrophe,'" Wang said. "I expected that she
would meet no serious opponent in this tourney, because they do
not belong to the same category as He."
</P>
<P>
However, the results went totally to the opposite.
</P>
<P>
Wang explained that in 1995 He had only participated in the
World Military Games in Rome, which obviously affected her form in
the Tianjin Tourney.
</P>
<P>
"After this Champions' competitions, we will try our best to
provide her more opportunity to take part in the major
tournament," said Wang, who also revealed that He will take part
in the upcoming Asian Championships which starts in Bangkok on
April 12.
</P>
<P>
"In fact, she has been doing well in the daily training," the
coach said. "But she was a bit nervous in Wednesday's final."
</P>
<P>
Wang considered the loss of weight was another reason for He's
failure. She now weighs 59 kilograms, 3.5 off the ideal weight
set by the coach. "That will affect her in the burst-out strength
in the competitions," Wang said.
</P>
<P>
He Cihong still has the chance to attempt in Saturday's 200m
backstroke.

<HEADLINE> China Has 1,747 Star Hotels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Five-star comfort is a growing
reality across China as luxury hotels open across the country.
</P>
<P>
Latest figures show that China has a total of 1,747 star
hotels, including 39 five-star, 107 four-star, 522 three-star and
839 two-star hotels.
</P>
<P>
According to the China National Tourism Administration, the
hotels are designed to provide quality services for tourists at
home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
During 1994 and 1995, the administration examined the country's
star-rated hotels in line with a state regulation concerning the
star hotel classification to ensure the quality of services of the
hotels.
</P>
<P>
China's tourism industry has witnessed a fast growth in the
past five years, with 212 million overseas tourists arriving, and
the country earning a total of 27.5 billion US dollars from
tourism. The star-rated hotel industry constituted much to the
revenue.

<HEADLINE> Remote Sensors Should Pinpoint Three Gorges Relics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beijing, April 5 (Xinhua)-- An expert has called for using
archaeology-related remote sensing techniques to survey and save
cultural relics in the Three Gorges area.
</P>
<P>
Liu Shuren, professor with the Shanghai-based East China Normal
University, says that the use of photos of relics to be taken with
the remote sensing technique will make it easier to identify the
position, and scale of relics in the sparsely-populated Three
Gorges area.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the Yangtze River will be dammed for the gigantic
Three Gorges Project in central China's Hubei Province, inundating
four counties and cities along the river.
</P>
<P>
When the river's water level finally reaches 175 meters in the
year 2009, a 632 sq km area will be under water.
</P>
<P>
Considering that there are large amounts of cultural relics in
the area, the State Bureau of Relics in 1993 organized 300
scientists from 30 universities and research institutes to survey
and investigate such relics. A plan to save and protect the relics
was drawn up in late March.
</P>
<P>
But with time running out, and limited funds and personnel, it
is extremely difficult to collect sufficient data on more than
1,000 cultural relics, and survey and move those relics and
ancient structures.
</P>
<P>
This is why Prof. Liu Shuren, head of the Urban and
Archaeology-Related Remote Sensing Lab of East China Normal
University, asked government departments to use remote sensing
techniques.
</P>
<P>
According to Liu, compared with traditional techniques, the
remote sensing technique covers a far larger area, and is much
more efficient.

<HEADLINE> Asia-Pacific Meeting on Child Sex Closes in Bangkok </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 5 (Xinhua) -- The Asia Pacific regional
consultation meeting on anti-child prostitution called for
cooperation to fight against commercial sexual exploitation of
children as the meeting closed here today.
</P>
<P>
The trafficking of child prostitutes within and across national
borders is a critical problem in the region, according to a draft
consensus statement issued by the meeting,
</P>
<P>
It urged specific interventions, including bilateral and
multi-lateral agreements, to address the problem.
</P>
<P>
"There should be no concept of 'voluntary consent' to sexual
relations in national law (for children) below the age of 16 years
or majority, whichever age is higher," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
It said that with the ongoing rapid social and economic
changes, families are finding it increasingly difficult to care
for and protect their children.
</P>
<P>
Poverty contributes significantly to child prostitution, the
statement stressed.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 delegates from 14 Asia-Pacific countries, regions
and international organizations attended the four-day meeting in
preparation for the World Congress Against Commercial Sexual
Exploitation of Children scheduled for August 27-31 in Stockholm,

<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, April 5 (Xinhua) -- A color scheme for taxis in
Guangzhou in south China's booming Guangdong Province has been
introduced.
</P>
<P>
It means that the city's 13,350 taxis will have to display
uniform colors before the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
The move is mainly aimed to protect taxi drivers' interests,
for the convenience of passengers, and to greet the 2,210
anniversary of the founding of the city.
</P>
<P>
Guangzhou ranks in fourth place in number of taxis in China.
</P>
<P>
According to the regulation, taxis running in the downtown
areas will be mainly red colored with light grey color on their
top and around their windows.
</P>
<P>
Taxis running on the outskirts and counties will be mainly
painted yellow. The color on their roofs, and around the windows
will also be grey.
</P>
<P>
All the taxis are also required to have their companies' names
and supervision telephone numbers on the doors.
</P>
<P>
To accomplish this task, the local government has allocated 10
million yuan (about 1.2 million US dollars) to subsidize local
taxi companies and owners to get their taxis re-painted.
</P>
<P>
At present, China has a total of 500,000 taxis, a low rate
compared with its 1.2 billion population.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Sky-Watchers "Crazy" for Bright Comet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Standing in a chilly breeze of a
Spring night, Ding Yiming looked up at the starry sky and tried to
search for a bright comet through a telescope.
</P>
<P>
Ding, an amateur sky-watcher from Beijing, had ridden her bike
for an hour from her downtown home, to an observation station on
the outskirts, in order to observe the Hyakutake Comet approaching
the earth during recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, and under the same sky, thousands of other
sky-watchers were observing the comet in different places of the
city, or around the country.
</P>
<P>
"We've received more than 6,000 eager visitors since we
provided two telescopes for observing the comet two weeks ago,
which is far beyond our expectation," Situ Dong, from the Beijing
Planetarium, told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
"Many of our visitors are curious children, accompanied by
their parents or teachers," she said.
</P>
<P>
The 554-year-old Beijing Ancient Observatory also opened two
telescopes to meet visitors' enthusiasm for sky-watching, which
was aroused by recent media coverage of the comet's visit,
occurring only once in every 20,000 years.
</P>
<P>
A middle-aged man made a special trip by taxi to the
planetarium from the suburban Daxing county. He told the "Beijing
Daily" that it was worth spending an expensive taxi fare for a
look at the comet.
</P>
<P>
"Think about it," he said, "We usually describe a thing not
seen once in a century as 'a rare one'. But the comet visits our
globe once in 200 centuries."
</P>
<P>
People's enthusiasm for sky-watching was matched by that of
learning about the comet, which was used to be regarded as a bad
omen bringing ill luck to those who watched it.
</P>
<P>
Three hot-lines were opened by the planetarium on March 22,
busily answering different kinds of questions about the comet and
how to observe it.
</P>
<P>
"Many people even made calls from faraway Shandong, Hebei,
Guangdong, and other provinces to tell us what they've watched,"
said Situ.
</P>
<P>
Telescopes, although costing 600-700 yuan, or the sum of
monthly salary of an ordinary employee in Beijing, became
hot-sellers in shops. And so did books introducing knowledge about
astronomy, space and the solar system.
</P>
<P>
Ordinary people's enthusiasm for astronomy showed that people
are paying more and more attention to obtaining knowledge
currently in China, the "Beijing Daily" quoted an unidentified
astronomer as saying.
</P>
<P>
The astronomers predict that the Chinese public's zeal for
astronomy will not fade until March to April next year, when the
newly-discovered Hale-Bopp Comet will approach the Earth, and a
total solar eclipse will be visible in northeast China.
</P>
<P>
"We'll surly organize people to observe when the time comes,"
Li Enjie, a staff member at the planetarium, told Xinhua.

<P>
COLOMBO, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan security forces are
continuing a major search for rebel arms in Colombo, where large
stocks of lethal weaponry are reportedly hidden by Tamil rebels,
police sources said today.
</P>
<P>
The police said they have taken several suspects into custody
and unearthed large quantities of arms and ammunition, including
some from a parking lot a few days ago.
</P>
<P>
Many more weapons are suspected to be still hidden in the city
while Tamil rebels are believed to be planning attacks on key
installations and VIPs in Colombo with the weapons, said the
sources.
</P>
<P>
The Tamil rebels have been targeting key places in Colombo
after having suffered badly at the hands of the Sri Lankan
security forces in Jaffna peninsula last November.
</P>
<P>
On January 31, a Tamil suicide squad exploded a car bomb at the
Central Bank in Colombo, killing almost 100 people and injuring
over 1,400.
</P>
<P>
Police have warned of possible more Tamil attacks in Colombo
With the Sinhala and Hindu New Year due soon on April 12 and 13
following the Easter vacation this weekend.
</P>
<P>
The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam rebels have been waging a
13-year guerrilla war against the government for a separate Tamil
state, which claimed over 50,000 lives.

<HEADLINE> Israel, Turkey Conclude Agreement on Military Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Israel and Turkey have recently
signed a strategic cooperation agreement, reported Israel Radio
today.
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the pact, Israeli and Turkish airforce
planes will be able to carry out training manoeuvres in each
other country's air space.
</P>
<P>
It was signed by Israeli Defense Ministry Director General
David Ivry and Turkish Deputy Chief of Staff Cevik Bir during the
latter's visit to Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
The two countries will also set up a security forum for
strategic dialogue.
</P>
<P>
The agreement is first of its kind to be signed by Israel and
will enable Israel to have additional areas for military training.
</P>
<P>
Although Turkey, a Moslem state, established diplomatic
relations with Israel as early as in 1949, until 1993 when the
Oslo accord was signed it had always avoided any overly warm
gestures with the Jewish state. Relations have developed rapidly
since then. During the past year alone bilateral trade had more
than doubled. Turkish President Suleyman Demirel paid a four-day
official visit to Israel last month and several economic
agreements were signed.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government has also approved the Israel Aircraft
Industries plant to upgrade 54 Turkish Phantoms at the cost of
650 million U.S. dollars.

<P>
TIANJIN, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 1,000 white swans have
continued to stay and play at a reservoir in the coastal city of
Tianjin in north China.
</P>
<P>
They either play on the water surface, or fly high over the
Dagang reservoir, illustrating a traditional Chinese poetic
picture of ships moving on the water, accompanied by birds and
swans flying over them.
</P>
<P>
Sources said the local reservoir, now holding 300 million cubic
meters of water, and covering a water area of about 14,670
hectares, has attracted a large number of rare birds to spend
their winter, due to the large water area and the warmer weather.
</P>
<P>
Experts said it has been rare in two decades for so many white
swans to gather at the reservoir for such a long period of time.
</P>
<P>
The swans, who enjoy the state's second-level protection,
arrived during the Spring Festival which fell on February 19 this
year. They were followed by groups of wild ducks and birds.

<HEADLINE> Chain Store Development in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 5 (Xinhua) -- China is negotiating with world
famous chain-store giants to set up Sino-foreign stores.
</P>
<P>
Development of the chain-store business helps to reform the
mechanism of China's traditional commerce, promotes socialized
production in industry and agriculture, and meets market needs,
said Huang Hai, director of the policy and regulation department
under the Ministry of Internal Trade.
</P>
<P>
Reviewing the growth of the fledging industry in China, Huang
said that chain stores were built on a trial basis in 11 large
cities including Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou in 1992, as a
major reform in China's circulation system.
</P>
<P>
Vice Premier Li Lanqing endorsed the drive at a national
conference held in Guangzhou, a window of China's commercial
industry, in March 1994, to sum up the experience and lessons in
chain store trading.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1995, the number of chain companies in China
increased to 400, with 6,000 chain stores. They broadly fell into
seven categories: supermarkets, convenience shops, name-brand
special shops, department stores, snack counters, service centers
and building material shops.
</P>
<P>
Though the chain business grew rapidly, it was pinned down by
many difficulties, such as lack of circulating funds and
management on tax and market regulation, Huang said.
</P>
<P>
To speed up chain business development, Huang outlined several
measures:
</P>
<P>
-- Chain stores should be set up in large cities and
economically-developed regions in near future, as these areas have
well-organized commercial networks and easy access to
communications;
</P>
<P>
-- They should combine foreign experience with actual
conditions in China;
</P>
<P>
-- Stress will be put on supermarkets and convenience shopping
to meet the needs of everyday life of ordinary people, and
</P>
<P>
-- Existing grain shops and groceries should be converted into
chain stores to avoid waste of materials. Measures will be taken
to form inter-regional chain companies.

<HEADLINE> India Urged to Change Telephone Tariff Structure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Multinational companies (MNCs)
have launched a campaign for changes in the tariff structure of
India's basic telephone services even before the formal
inauguration of the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India, reports
said today.
</P>
<P>
The MNCs want private operators to be allowed to evolve a
structure for the monthly rental and the tariff on telephone calls
to reduce the expected loss during the initial years of operation.
</P>
<P>
They said the change was necessary because the basic service is
less lucrative than mobile telephone services, according to the
reports.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the MNCs urged the Department of
Telecommunications to make necessary changes in the tariff rates
as soon as possible to attract funds for setting up the
infrastructure facilities of the basic services and to save the
companies from insolvency.
</P>
<P>
The government's response to the campaign is still yet to be
known.

<HEADLINE> Ruling Congress Party Tries to Win Back Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Indian Congress Party's High
Command have reportedly intensified its efforts to woo rebellious
leaders including former ministers and stalwarts back to the
party.
</P>
<P>
Though Congress Party spokesman V. N. Gadgil announced that all
Congress men who have filed nominations against the party's
official nominees stand expelled from the party, a
damage-limitation exercise was underway.
</P>
<P>
Union Home Minister S. B. Chavan would be in charge of the
process to woo rebellious leaders in Tamil Nadu, where many
Congress Party members opposed the party's high command decision
to tie up with the state chief minister's party, the AIADMK, the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Digvijay Singh has been asked to
approach former union ministers Scindia and Kamal Nath, both
"Hawala" tainted ministers who had filed nominations for Lok Sabha
(lower house) elections to be held from April 27 after being
denied Congress tickets.
</P>
<P>
"We are persuading disgruntled leaders to put the party above
their individual interests and hope that some of them will come
around," a senior official from the All India Congress Committee
(AICC) said.
</P>
<P>
The return of Tamil Nadu MP B. Devarajan from Moopanar's new
party has given impetus to the fresh unity efforts which are being
undertaken on a low key.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the emerging election scenario in the country,
Home Minister Chavan said that he did not subscribe to the view
that there would be a hung parliament. "I have no doubt we will
be able to form the government."

<HEADLINE> India to Continue Export of Iron Ore to Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Despite stiff opposition from
major political parties in and outside the parliament, the Indian
government has renewed the five-year agreement with Japan for
export of iron ore, official sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
An Indian delegation, which visited Japan in the last week of
January, signed a memorandum of agreement for export of iron ore
during fiscal year 1996-2000. The agreement followed the cabinet's
decision on December 8, 1995, authorizing the Commerce Ministry to
sign a long-term pact for iron ore export.
</P>
<P>
The opposition has been demanding that since prices realized
from such exports are low, value addition to the ores could be
done within the country to augment domestic output of steel.
</P>
<P>
Against actual exports of 43.264 million tons during 1991-96,
the Commerce Ministry has committed to export up to 45.5 million
tons for 1996-2000.

<HEADLINE> Daimler-Benz Pays No Dividend for 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Germany's leading industrial group
Daimler-Benz will pay no dividend for the first time in its
history after plunging 5.7 billion marks (about 3.85 billion US
dollars) into the red 1995.
</P>
<P>
Last year's huge loss was due to spending on reorganization and
restructuring including the dismantling of the electrical
engineering subsidiary AEG and the anticipated bankruptcy of Dutch
aviation firm Fokker.
</P>
<P>
The group announced the decision on April 3 after a meeting of
its supervisory board. A dividend of 11 marks (about 7.4 US
dollars) per share was paid in 1994 after a net profit of 895
million marks (about 605 million US dollars). The company said
it expected to return to profit this year.
</P>
<P>
The group also announced it was dropping its practice of
publishing financial reports to both German and US standards,
begun after its New York listing in 1993. Future financial reports
will be published according to U.S. standards.

<HEADLINE> Altered Gene Cited As Cause of Lung Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 4 (Xinhua) -- American cancer researchers have
now come close to answering the question why some people smoke two
packs of cigarettes a day and get cancer, and others smoke just as
much and don't.
</P>
<P>
Researchers have discovered a damaged gene in many lung cancer
tumors that seem to play a critical role in developing the
disease, according to Friday's issue of the journal Cell.
</P>
<P>
The gene, named fragile histidine triad, or FHIT, is involved
in a number of airway and digestive tract tumors, and is thought
to work normally as the vital shield that blocks the growth of
many deadly tumors.
</P>
<P>
The new finding indicates that the FHIT is the target for
genetic alterations caused by smoking. It also suggests that
there may be an interaction between genetic susceptibility and
exposure to tobacco.
</P>
<P>
The gene may be more fragile in some people than others,
researchers said.
</P>
<P>
There are 44 million cigarette smokers in the United States and
160,000 Americans are killed by lung cancer a year.

<HEADLINE> AT&AMP;T's Former Equipment Unit Sought After by Investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Lucent Technologies Inc., a
former telephone equipment division of AT&AMP;T Corp. in the U.S.,
found itself to be much sought after by investors on the New York
Stock Exchange when it was initially listed today.
</P>
<P>
The company publicly offered 112 million shares, at a price of
27 U.S. dollars per share, making the overall stock offering worth
3.02 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Investors pushed up Lucent's value nearly 15 percent on the
first day, proof not only of interest in the growing
communications equipment industry but a strong stock market,
according to market analysts.
</P>
<P>
Growth prospects for Lucent and the telecommunications
equipment industry account for the strong investor interest,
analysts say.
</P>
<P>
Lucent accounted for 21.4 billion dollars of AT&AMP;T's 79.6
billion dollars in revenue last year. It emerges as one of the
nation's 50 largest industrial companies and the second-largest
communications manufacturer after Motorola Inc. It also is the
dominant manufacturer of telephones and network switches in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
Lucent was formed as a result of AT&AMP;T's planned restructuring
into three separate, publicly held companies, dealing with
different business scopes. The new company is designed to
manufacture telephone equipment. Already, Lucent has made an
arrangement with Sprint, the No. 3 U.S. long distance telephone
service company, to provide equipment for its wireless business,
it is reported here today.
</P>
<P>
Bell Laboratories serve as the research and development arm
for the new company.
</P>
<P>
Later this year, AT&AMP;T plans to spin off its 8 billion dollars
computer manufacturing business, NCR Corp. The remaining AT&AMP;T
Corp. will still be the nation's biggest communications company,
with about 50 billion dollars in annual sales.
</P>
<P>
AT&AMP;T has said it would cut 40,000 jobs during the breakup.
About 22,000 of those are in Lucent's operations.
</P>
<P>
AT&AMP;T still owns 83 percent of Lucent's overall 635.6 million
shares. It will divide them among AT&AMP;T stockholders later this
year. When that happens, AT&AMP;T investors will get approximately
one Lucent share for every three AT&AMP;T shares.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine Approves New Truncated Crimean Constitution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, April 4 (Xinhua) -- The longstanding constitutional row
between the Ukraine and Crimea eased today after the Ukrainian
parliament approved a new constitution put forward last month by
Crimea.
</P>
<P>
However, more than 20 clauses in the Crimean constitution,
concerning the republic's citizenship, its emblem and its
independent rights to foreign trade and diplomacy, were thrown
out. Legislators said they violate Ukraine's own constitution and
are unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
A law was approved ordering the Crimean parliament to revise
those clauses and some other terms within a month to make the
constitution conform to Ukraine's constitution.
</P>
<P>
The constitution must be approved by the Ukrainian parliament
before it can be implemented, the law added.
</P>
<P>
Crimea was part of Russia before 1954 when it was incorporated
into the Ukraine by the Soviet Union. But after the break-up of
the Soviet Union, the mainly Russian populated Crimea expressed a
desire to reunite with Russia.
</P>
<P>
The row over the constitution goes back to 1992 when the
Ukraine was forced to give the Crimean Peninsula autonomous status
following a referendum declared illegal by Kiev.
</P>
<P>
The Crimean parliament formed its own constitution and
presidency but both were abolished by Ukraine in March 1995, on
the grounds that they encouraged growing separatist and
independence tendencies.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine told the Crimean parliament to come up with a
new constitution, but rejected the document presented to it in
February this year, saying it should be turned into a "charter"
and revised.
</P>
<P>
The Crimean parliament protested, demanding that its
right to a referendum on its status should not be written out of
any new constitution and urged Ukraine's Supreme Soviet to approve
the draft constitution presented in February.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 5 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi caretaker government
Thursday ordered the law enforcing agencies to recover illegal
arms to improve the law and order situation in the country.
</P>
<P>
The order was issued at the first meeting of the Council of
Advisers headed by Chief Adviser Habibur Rahman since this
11-member caretaker government was set up on April 3.
</P>
<P>
Under the pressure of the non-cooperation campaign launched by
major opposition parties, the government of Begum Khaleda Zia
resigned on March 30 to pave the way for a fresh election likely
to be held next month.
</P>
<P>
However, the formation of the caretaker government did not end
once and for all the prolonged political violence in Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
According to the local press, at least one person was killed
and more than one hundred injured Thursday in clashes between
rival political parties across the country.

<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Polish President Aleksander
Kwasniewski signed on Thursday two laws to ease control on
foreigners in buying real estate and starting up companies.
</P>
<P>
Under the new real estate law, any foreigner who conducts legal
bussiness in this country is allowed to buy 0.4 hectare of land
and houses without the permission of the Interior Ministry. A
foreigner who has obtained permanent resident permit is allowed to
own permanent housing.
</P>
<P>
The new company law, which is aimed at eliminating the
differences between local and foreign companies, removes the
approval procedures that foreigners until now have to go through
before setting up a company.
</P>
<P>
In the past, the foreign companies engaging in businesses in
sea shipping and air transportation, real estate, intermediary,
wholesale of imported consumer goods, legal consultation service
and other areas were subject to the approval procedures.
</P>
<P>
Under the new law, the administrative management procedures are
also simplified to attract more foreign capitals.

<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Poland and Russia have decided to
step up cooperation in the military sector as their joint
commission for trade and economic cooperation closed its meeting
today.
</P>
<P>
The two-day meeting prepared the documents to be signed by
Polish President Aleksander Kwasniewski next week during his trip
to Moscow.
</P>
<P>
Deputies from the two countries agreed at the meeting that
Poland will increase its export of weapons to Russia while Russian
manufacturers will provide the Polish army with necessary
components and spare parts of its equipment.
</P>
<P>
Oleg Davydov, deputy prime minister of Russia in charge of
foreign economic affairs and debt negotiations, said after the
meeting that the military cooperation between the two countries is
mainly of an economic nature and not of a strategic nature.
</P>
<P>
Poland and Russia also discussed contributing more efforts to
setting up a free trade zone among Russia, Central and West
European countries by 2010 or 2012.
</P>
<P>
Trade between Poland and Russia has picked up in 1994 after
three years of stalemate. Trade volume increased by 35 percent in
1995 as Russia has become the third largest trading partner of
Poland, behind France and Italy.

<HEADLINE> Nepalese Company Raises Prices of Petroleum Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, April 5 (Xinhua) -- The state-run Nepal Oil
Corporation Thursday announced price hikes for petroleum products
in the country -- seven percent for petrol and 12 percent for
diesel.
</P>
<P>
The corporation said the adjustment was necessitated by the
gradual devaluation of the Nepalese currency against the US dollar
and the rise of petroleum price on the international market.
</P>
<P>
Retail prices in Kathmandu have increased from 29 to 31 rupees
(0.52 to 0.56 US dollars) per liter for petrol, from 12 to 13.5
rupees (0.22 to 0.24 US dollars) for diesel and from 8.5 to 9.5
rupees (0.15 to 0.17 US dollars) for kerosene, said the company.
</P>
<P>
It said special attention had been given to ensure that the
general public be least affected by the price hikes.
</P>
<P>
The company said that without the price adjustments, it would
run a loss of over 100 million rupees (nearly 2 million US
dollars) by the end of the current fiscal year in mid-July.
</P>
<P>
Consumption of petroleum products in Nepal is estimated to
total 588 million liters this year and is expected to grow by more
than 12 percent next year.

<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Slovak Foreign Minister Yuraj
Schenk today accused the European Union of wantonly criticizing
some clauses of a newly-amended criminal law of his state.
</P>
<P>
Schenk expressed his regret that the EU failed to consult with
Slovakia before criticizing his country.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister pointed out that the EU criticism is a
premature move.
</P>
<P>
He said the EU should have had dialogues with Slovakia on a
basis of equality and partnership, which is the only effective way
for contacting.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Slovak parliament adopted the newly-amended
criminal law named "Law Defending Republic."
</P>
<P>
The amended law stipulates that those who organize rallies
aiming to topple the republic, damage the national honor and
interests, or spread abroad rumors against Slovakia are subject to
legal punishment.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the EU expressed its regret over some clauses of
the law, saying they violate human rights including freedom of
speech.
</P>
<P>
Defending the law, Slovak Deputy Prime Minister Jozef Kalman,
who also is in charge of Slovak integration into the EU, said
today the amended law is in conformity with the Slovak
Constitution.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Belarussian President Grigoryevich
Lukashenko said today he will not rule out the possibility of
forming a confederation with Russia in the future.
</P>
<P>
Lukashenko was quoted by Russian news agency Interfax as making
the remark at a news conference held at Belarussian capital of
Minsk.
</P>
<P>
The president, who signed a treaty on Tuesday with Russian
President Boris Yeltsin on establishing the Community of Sovereign
Republics, said a confederation with Russia would be possible if
the Belarus-Russia integration proceeds smoothly in the following
"transitional period " of one and a half years.
</P>
<P>
However, he stressed that whether to form the confederation
should only be decided by referendums in Belarus and Russia.
</P>
<P>
After signing the integration pact with Russia, Lukashenko has
come under strong protests from some opposition organizations
which denounced him as attempting to restore the former Soviet
Union while surrendering Belarus's sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, about 20,000 people gathered in Minsk to protest
Lukashenko's policies towards Russia.
</P>
<P>
Lukashenko strongly dismissed the criticism, saying the union
move was not aimed at reviving the former Soviet Union, but
"merging the spiritual and material potentials of the two
countries," therefore it would not jeopardize the sovereignty of
either country.
</P>
<P>
He said that he would submit as soon as possible the copy of
treaty on forming a Belarussian-Russian community to the Supreme
Soviet for approval and he foresaw "no problem" for its passage.

BRUSSELS, April 4 (Xinhua) -- The European Union has slapped a

perfumes after protests from French producer Rhone-Poulenc.
</P>
<P>
The EU imposed temporary anti-dumping tariffs on Chinese
coumarin, a synthetic chemical used in making perfume, in May 1995
after complaints by the only European coumarin producer,
Rhone-Poulenc, that a 50 per cent slump in its market share
was due to an increase in Chinese imports into Europe.

<HEADLINE> Coach Hints More Potential for Liu Limin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, April 4 (Xinhua/OANA) -- Zhao Ge, coach of Chinese
butterfly specialist Liu Limin, hinted Thursday night that the
Asian record holder still had much potential.
</P>
<P>
"It's not the proper time for breaking the record," he said
after the women's 100m butterfly final of Chinese champions'
tourney.
</P>
<P>
Liu, pre-race top favourite, finished a modest fourth in the
preliminary but struggled to edge Cai Huiyu, an unfancied teenager
from Shanghai, in the last 20 meters for the laurel.
</P>
<P>
Liu clocked 59.57 seconds in the final, 1.29 seconds slower
than her own Asian mark set at the Hiroshima Asian Games in
October 1994; 1.64 seconds off the 15-year-old world record
set by U.S. Mary T. Meagher.
</P>
<P>
Liu's coach Zhao recognized his disappointment at the
results.
</P>
<P>
"The two times, both in the preliminary and the final are not
normal for her," Zhao said. "I am not satisfied, and I think she
herself is not satisfied either."
</P>
<P>
Liu's out-of-form physical condition Thursday was a part of
reason for her slow finish, according to Zhao. "More physical
adjustments are needed for her."
</P>
<P>
Anyway, the "double" Asian record holder, both in the 100m and
200m butterfly events, broke the China's swimming doldrums in 1995
with a brilliant gold medal from the World University Games in
Fukuka, Japan. She clocked 59.74 seconds for the 100m butterfly
crown. That was her best place in the 1994-1995 year-ending world
ranking in the event.
</P>
<P>
Angel Martino of the Untied States, 28, swam a 1996 best time
of 59.40 seconds at the U.S. Olympic trial in Indianapolis last
March.
</P>
<P>
Zhao also praised the 16-year-old runner-up Cai Huiyu as "a
promising youngster."
</P>
<P>
Cai, 100m butterfy gold winner at last October's Inner-city
Games in Nanjing, overcame a slight mishap to settle for the
second, at 59.61 seconds, as she lost her glasses in the midway of
the race. Her clocking was just 0.04 seconds behind of Liu.
</P>
<P>
"She made a perfect performance today," Zhao said. "She should
have done better."

HAVANA, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Latin American countries have
condemned the U.S. Helms-Burton Bill tightening economic sanctions
against Cuba, saying it violates international law.
</P>
<P>
More than 400 delegates from 20 Latin American and Caribbean
countries attending a five-day international meeting called "Latin
America Supports Cuba" said in a statement that the Helms-Burton
Bill not only hurts the sovereignty of Cuba and other countries,
but also violates international laws.

<P>
The statement warned Latin American countries of a possible
U.S. invasion of Cuba after the Clinton administration
strengthened its 30-year blockade against Havana in retaliation
for the shooting down of two American civil planes by Cuba air
force in late February. Cuba has accused the United States of
violating the air space of the island country.
</P>
<P>
The meeting also passed a special resolution demanding the
U.S. return 400 computers donated by U.S. priests to Cuban health
organizations.

<HEADLINE> Waste Straw Grows Into Money Saving Food </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Animal feed made from straw is
helping south China's Guangdong Province save over three million
tons of grain every year.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Governor Ou Guangyuan said Guangdong, one of China's
most economically developed regions, is to produce animal feed out
of straw to make its livestock-breeding sector save vital grains
during the 1996-2000 period.
</P>
<P>
Ou said the provincial government will earmark three to five
million yuan in five years to set up straw feed model areas in 25
counties.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2000 over seven million tons of straw, over 30
percent of the province's total, will be converted into animal
feed, he said.
</P>
<P>
This can save a major rice producer 3.3 million tons of grain
every year, he added.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong, with its meager per-capita farmland acreage, is
striving to achieve grain self-sufficiency, and cannot spare much
grain to produce animal feed.
</P>
<P>
The price hike of corn and other feed materials in recent years
has also piled on the troubles of livestock breeders, Ou said.
</P>
<P>
Zhanjiang City, feeding cattle with treated straw since 1992,
has spread the technique to 12,000 rural households in 58
townships, with each of the households raising an average of 12
cattle.
</P>
<P>
The technique so far has saved the city 100,000 tons of grain
by making use of nearly 11 percent of the city's straw.
</P>
<P>
In the 1996-2000 period, cities of Zhanjiang, Shaoguan,
Meizhou, Jieyang and Shanwei will be built into straw feed model
centers.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong also plans to build Zhanjiang and Shaoguan cities
into south China's cattle breeding centers.
</P>
<P>
The livestock breeding sector in Guangdong has reported
continuous output increases for the past 17 years.
</P>
<P>
In 1995 the total output of animal products, topping three
million tons in weight, valued 17.3 billion yuan, Ou said, adding
that the amount accounted for 22.2 percent of the province's total
agricultural output.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Air travelers in China will no
longer be permitted to take their pets with them when they board
planes, according to a new regulation by the Civil Aviation
Administration of China.
</P>
<P>
The regulation stipulates that small animals be checked,
instead of being allowed to travel with their owners in the cabin.
</P>
<P>
CAAC explained that travelers should tell the airline
beforehand about cats, dogs, or any other domestic pets when
booking or paying for tickets, and provide appropriate vaccination
certificates, before trying to check-in with the animals.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the animals should be placed in standard pet
containers, they said.
</P>
<P>
The new regulation is a means of restricting the growing number
of passengers who want to put Fido the dog or Felix the cat on the
plane seat with them, they added.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Stocks on Wall Street finished
mixed today, with blue chips falling from record levels, and broad
stock indexes rose, with some reaching new highs.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average dipped 6.86 points to
5,682.88, easing off its record closing Wednesday of 5,689.74.
</P>
<P>
The Dow rose 102.60 points in a shortened week. The market will
be closed in observance of Good Friday.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues edged out advancers by 1,197 to 1,066. Big
Board volume was light at 382.01 million shares, under Wednesday's
already slow pace.
</P>
<P>
Several broad-market indexes hit record highs, including the
NYSE's composite index, up 0.11 to 351.92, and the Nasdaq
composite index, up 2.25 to 1,118.10. The American Stock
Exchange's market value index rose 2.78 to 577.10, hitting its
fifth consecutive high and its 14th for the year.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index slipped 0.02 to 655.86.
</P>
<P>
Long-term Treasury bond prices fell more than 5 points,
yielding 6.67 percent.
</P>
<P>
Trading in both the stock and bond markets were very quiet
ahead of Friday, when the government is scheduled to release March
job-creation and unemployment rate figures. The markets are
anxious about these numbers. A huge, unexpected run-up in February
job creation dashed hopes of immediate further interest rate cuts,
causing a plunge in the Dow on March 8.
</P>
<P>
Analysts expect the March figures will show an increase of
nonfarm payroll jobs, and the nation's unemployment rate is
expected to remain at 5.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Investors said there will likely be a delayed reaction, no
matter what the numbers show.

<HEADLINE> World Economy to Grow 3 Percent in 1996: Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 4 (Xinhua) -- The world economy will grow
at 3 percent, rebounding slightly from a generally lackluster
performance of a 2.3 percent increase in 1995, according to a
recent meeting held at the U.N. headquarters.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Department of Public Information reported today that
more than 100 international experts made the forecast above at the
meeting of Project LINK held from March 25 to 28.
</P>
<P>
Project LINK, founded in 1968, is now under the joint
responsibility of 1980 Nobel Laureate Lawrence Klein, Professor
Peter Pauly of the University of Toronto and the U.N. Department
of Economic and Social Information and Policy Analysis.
</P>
<P>
A number of premises underlie the forecast of moderate
improvement in world economic growth. They include a revival in
the U.S. economy after a slow growth in the second half of 1995,
signs of recovery in Japan, a turnaround in several Latin American
economies, and continued strong growth in many countries in South
and East Asia, according to the experts.
</P>
<P>
The LINK experts noted that Africa was experiencing the fastest
economic growth since the start of the decade. Not only output
growth, as just over 2.5 percent, about equal to the population
growth rate in 1995, but the continent as a whole was expected to
see a significant increase in GDP per capita in the current year
for the first time since 1985.
</P>
<P>
Developing Asia will average a growth rate of 6.5 percent to
the end of the decade if the necessary cross-border flows of
capital, labor and technology take place. The year 1995 recorded
another year of impressive economic performance of 7 percent
growth in Asia.
</P>
<P>
In that scenario, China continued to be one of the
fastest-growing economies in the world and was expected to
register an 8.9 and 8 percent increase in 1996 and the following
year respectively.
</P>
<P>
The experts also predicted that the world trade will continue
to expand at a faster pace than output in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Despite the optimistic note, experts expressed concerns about
high rates of unemployment, growing income inequality, in
particular the the industrialize economies' reaction to current
policies calling for fiscal consolidation.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Signs New Farm Bill Abolishing 60-Year  Subsidies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 4 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
signed today a new and historic farm bill that cuts off the
over-60-year-old link between crop prices and government
subsidies.
</P>
<P>
The seven-year law ends government-guaranteed prices for major
grains, soy-beans and cotton which have been a key farm policy
since the 1930's Depression. Instead, farmers will get guaranteed
payments that decline over seven years and an immediate end to
most planting controls. The payments total 36 billion dollars over
seven years and account for most of the spending in the 47 billion
dollar law.
</P>
<P>
"This farm bill is the most historic change in American
agriculture since the 1930s," said Senator Richard Lugar, chairman
of the Senate Agriculture Committee. "Production and supply
controls will end, and farmers will produce for the market for the
first time since the Great Depression."
</P>
<P>
Although the Clinton administration opposed the key provision,
the bill partially met some of its requests to avoid a veto,
including money for conservation and environmental protection and
for rural development and research, and a guarantee that food
stamps and other nutrition programs will continue while Congress
works on overhaul of the welfare system.
</P>
<P>
The government also supported crop provisions giving growers
more flexibility to plant what they want.
</P>
<P>
"The expansion of planting flexibility will improve U.S.
competitiveness in world markets," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
The signing means Agriculture Department employees will rush to
carry out a law that guarantees many will lose their jobs due to
cut-off and simplification of farm programs. But U.S. Secretary
for Agriculture Dan Glickman said the law creates enough work to
prevent job losses in the first year or two.
</P>
<P>
Because of an earlier reorganization, the department already
expected to lose 2,500 county-level employees between 1993 and
1999. The farm law could cut that number by 1,400 more.
</P>
<P>
The department is required by the legislation to merge 33
regional dairy price-setting agreements into between 10 and 14,
and to make prices more uniform.

<HEADLINE> Perry: US Determined to Stop Libyan Chemical  Weapons Plant Construction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 4 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary William
Perry reiterated today that the United States is determined to use
all necessary means to stop construction of a nerve-gas plant that
U.S. intelligence believes Libya is building inside a mountain.
</P>
<P>
Perry made the remarks in an interview with American reporters
en route from Cairo to Washington. The Pentagon chief cut short
his visit to Egypt by one day after learning U.S. Commerce
Secretary Ron Brown was killed in a plane crash in southeastern
Croatia Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Perry said that the United States still had time to pursue
diplomatic means and other approaches to stop the construction.
But he didn't rule out a military option against the Libyan
project.
</P>
<P>
Testifying before the U.S. Congress last month, U.S. Central
Intelligence Agency (CIA) Director John Deutch described the
Libyan project as the largest underground chemical weapons plant
in the world.
</P>
<P>
Perry said that he discussed the Libyan plant with Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak Wednesday and showed him intelligence
photos to support the U.S. claim that the facility is designed to
produce chemical weapons, not commercial pharmaceuticals.
</P>
<P>
But Perry declined to be specific about when U.S. intelligence
thinks it will be ready to start operating.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Yugoslav Sanctions Devastate Economy: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav Minister Without
Portfolio Margit Savovic said today that three and a half years of
international sanctions against Yugoslavia had brought 3.5 million
Yugoslavs, or 35 percent of the population, to the brink of
poverty.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a meeting of physicians and associates of the
United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) in Yugoslavia held at
Cuprija city in central Serbia, Savovic said that the sanctions
had crippled the national economy and the social policy.
</P>
<P>
She said that 400,000 families, with 800,000 children, were
living on a subsistence level, and about 570,000 others were
barely above this level.
</P>
<P>
In addition, there are 240,000 refugee children in Yugoslavia
who came from war zones in other parts of the former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
She said that the mortality rate among the children had risen
dramatically, especially those under the age of five, and that
Yugoslavia's birth had dropped by 12,000 babies every year on the
average since the imposition of the sanctions in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Security Council suspended the sanctions
against Yugoslavia on November 22, 1995.
</P>
<P>
The gross national product per capita has dropped from 2,230
dollars before the sanctions to barely 1,194 dollars, Savovic
said.
</P>
<P>
She said that time was ripe for a new comprehensive policy
toward children, whose welfare must be the concern of all -- the
state, non-governmental bodies, the media and specialized
institutes.

<HEADLINE> Rwanda's Tragedy Must Not Be Repeated, UN Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 4 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali said today that the world must not allow the
tragedy of genocide in Rwanda to be repeated.
</P>
<P>
On the occasion of the second anniversary of the genocide in
Rwanda, Boutros-Ghali said in a statement that those responsible
for committing the crimes should never go unpunished.
</P>
<P>
After a plane carrying President Juvenal Habyarimana of Rwanda
and President Cyprien Ntaryamira of Burundi was shot down by
rocket-fire on April 6, 1994, widespread killings began in Kigali
and also in other parts of the country. The civil war claimed more
than 1 million lives and forced nearly 3 million more to flee to
neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
"On behalf of the United Nations system, I wish to reiterate
my profound compassion and my sincere condolences to all the
survivors of that tragic nightmare, which left a deep mark on
the conscience of mankind," the statement read.
</P>
<P>
Though there has been no world war since the United Nations
was established half a century ago, mankind continues to witness
violence, injustice and suffering, the statement noted.
</P>
<P>
"The time has come to reaffirm our commitment, to rededicate
our efforts to the creation of a better world," and to that end,
"to reaffirm our common faith" "in the dignity and worth of the
human person," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The international community and the government and people of
Rwanda are working side by side in the reconstruction of a
society psychologically, morally and physically rent asunder by
the tragic events, the statement added.

<HEADLINE> Unabomber Suspect Charged With Possession of Bomb  Components </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 4 (Xinhua) -- A former University of
California-Berkeley assistant professor of mathematics suspected
of being the Unabomber was charged today with possessing the
components of a bomb found in a search of his mountain cabin in
Montana.
</P>
<P>
FBI and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms agents found "a
partially completed pipe bomb" and chemicals and "diagrams and
notes" for making pipe bombs in the home of Theodore John
Kaczynski, said an affidavit by FBI agent Donald J. Sachtleben.
</P>
<P>
Kaczynski, 53, appeared before U.S. District Judge Charles C.
Lovell in federal court in Montana late this morning to hear the
felony charges, according to media reports.
</P>
<P>
The initial charge did not mention the Unabomber's 18-year
string of bombing attacks, killing three people and injuring 23
others. Federal officials said it was designed to hold Kaczynski
while agents put together a detailed case.
</P>
<P>
In his affidavit, Sachtleben wrote that agents had found a
cylindrical object wrapped in paper in a loft in the cabin.
</P>
<P>
"An X-ray of the package revealed what appears to me to be a
partially completed pipe bomb, including threaded pipe, wire and
other electrical components," Sachtleben wrote.
</P>
<P>
Ten three-ring binders were recovered filled with "page after
page of meticulous writings and sketches which I recognize to be
diagrams of explosive devices," Sachtleben wrote. The diagrams
show cross-sections of pipe bombs and electrical circuitry.
</P>
<P>
"These components... were intended to be readily assembled into
a destructive device such as a pipe bomb," the agent wrote.
</P>
<P>
The search of the cabin could last several days, agents said.
</P>
<P>
Kaczynski was taken into custody by federal agents Wednesday so
they could search his cabin.
</P>
<P>
The name Unabomber is based on the code name of the case,
"Unabom," because early targets were universities and airlines.
The last bombing was last year.
</P>
<P>
FBI agents had been staking out Kaczynski's hand-built cabin
for several weeks, after relatives in the Chicago area notified
authorities that they had stumbled across some of his old writings
and found them similar to the Unabomber's anarchist manifesto.
</P>
<P>
Kaczynski graduated from Harvard, and received a master's
degree and doctorate from the University of Michigan.

<HEADLINE> New York Police to Start Big Offensive Against Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 4 (Xinhua) -- The New York City Police
Department will launch its biggest ever assault on drug
trafficking next week in 22 of the city's 76 precincts, The New
York Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
Up to 3,000 officers and weapons ranging from new computer
software to hydraulic battering rams will be involved in the
action.
</P>
<P>
The offensive combines traditional undercover "buy and bust"
sweeps to remove dealers from the streets with computer-assisted
tactics, including a crack-down on credit-card fraud and cloned
cellular phones as an indirect way to apprehend midlevel and
big-time dealers.
</P>
<P>
The plan is centered on northern Brooklyn and pockets of Queens
and the Bronx which are drenched with drugs and are also the home
of a large portion of the criminals.
</P>
<P>
Police will close scores of bodegas, smoke shops and night
clubs where drug dealing takes place. And police also plan to pick
up parole violators and 15,000 other suspects with outstanding
warrants for everything from graffiti vandalism to robbery.
</P>
<P>
Mayor of the City Rudolph W. Giuliani has declared that the
goal is to "come as close as we can come to crushing drug
trafficking and drug business."

UNITED NATIONS, April 4 (Xinhua) - Palestinian President Yasser
Arafat today called Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali and
discussed with him the "deteriorating situation" in the
Palestinian territories after Israel's closure, according to a
U.N. spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Ahmad Fawzi, deputy spokesman for the U.N. secretary-general,
said that Boutros-Ghali, who was visiting Japan, told Arafat he
had conveyed to the Security Council and the General Assembly a
letter which the Palestinian leader sent him last Friday calling
for pressure on Israel to lift the closure.
</P>
<P>
Israel closed the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, affecting
almost 60,000 Palestinians who work in Israel, after a series of
suicide bombings from February 25 to March, which killed 58 people
in four incidents in Israeli cities. The closure has battered the
Palestinian economy.
</P>
<P>
Just the day before he received Arafat's letter, the U.N. chief
wrote to Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres, urging him to
consider lifting the closure of the territories.

<P>
LONDON, April 4 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister John Major
will make a one-day visit to Ukraine before arriving in Moscow
for the nuclear safety summit in a fortnight's time.
</P>
<P>
Major will hold talks with Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma to
assure him that Britain is committed to "a free and prosperous
Ukraine," according to a local report today.
</P>
<P>
He will also underline the British government's determination
to boost British exports to, and investment in, Ukraine, which is
now lagging far behind those of Germany, France and Italy.
</P>
<P>
Major's visit comes at a time when there is an increased voice
in Moscow calling for a reconstitution of the Soviet Union, which
has caused widespread unease in the former Soviet republics.
</P>
<P>
Britain regards the independence of Ukraine as a vital test of
Russian intentions, and any attempt to reincorporate Ukraine would
be seen here as an attempt to rebuild the Russian empire.
</P>
<P>
Malcolm Rifkind, British foreign secretary, is also planning,
together with his German counterpart, to visit Ukraine as early as
next month, according to the report.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia, IMF to Start New Round of Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Governor of the Yugoslav National
Bank Dragoslav Avramovic said today that the effort to regain
Yugoslavia's membership in the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
failed during the recent talks in Paris.
</P>
<P>
Avramovic told a press conference in Belgrade that this issue
remained open after the week-long talks with the IMF and the World
Bank Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav government offered that a delegation of the IMF
and the World Bank comes to Belgrade next week for a new round of
talks on this issue, he said.
</P>
<P>
The talks between the Yugoslav delegation headed by Avramovic
and the leading international financial institutions were the
first of its kind since the disintegration of the former
Yugoslavia in 1991 and the comprehensive sanctions imposed by the
international community in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council imposed the sanctions on Yugoslavia
on May 30, 1992 for its alleged involvement in the war in
neighboring Bosnia and suspended them on November 22, 1995, one
day after the Dayton peace accord on Bosnia was struck.
</P>
<P>
The Paris talks enabled a comprehensive analysis of the
economic trends in Yugoslavia and the consequences of the
international sanctions, the governor said.
</P>
<P>
The talks showed that both sides are striving to renew
Yugoslavia's membership in and resume its relations with the
leading world financial institutions, he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 4 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
reiterated here tonight his country's support for Lebanon, saying
that France has always stood on the Lebanese side.
</P>
<P>
In his reply speech at a banquet given by Lebanese President
Elias Hrawi in Chirac's honor, the French president said, "France
has been standing on your side in every stage of your history,
especially for the present when Lebanon wants to close the page of
the past pains."
</P>
<P>
He promised that France would again offer help to Lebanon for
restoring its sovereignty, and finding peace and prosperity as
well as its unity.
</P>
<P>
Chirac stressed the importance of a just and comprehensive
peace in the region, calling for the implementation of
U.N. Security Council resolution 425, which stipulates an Israeli
withdrawal from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The French president underlined that his country would never
accept a peace which does not respect the sovereignty and
independence of Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Chirac arrived in the Lenanese capital this afternoon, on the
first leg of his tour of the region, that will also take him to
Egypt and Saudi Arabia.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Increases Exports in January, February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavia increased its exports
by 97 percent in the first two months of this year over the same
period of last year, announced the Yugoslav Chamber of Commerce
today.
</P>
<P>
The chamber said the suspension of the three and half year
international sanctions against Yugoslavia have eased conditions
for foreign trade, but the full normalization of economic
relations with the rest of the world cannot be expected until
later this year when the sanctions are definitely lifted.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations suspended the sanctions against Yugoslavia
last November to reward its role in the regional peace process but
the official lift will not take place until September when the
elections in Bosnia begin.
</P>
<P>
The chamber told a session of tourism and foreign trade that
the United States, France, Austria and Germany are still applying
strict measures on Yugoslav firms. And regarding the property of
Yugoslav companies abroad, the most difficult situation is in the
United states.
</P>
<P>
It also said that in 1995, foreign trade rose by 24 percent
over 1994, but this has not had any significant impact on the rise
of production in the country.
</P>
<P>
In the first two months of 1996, there was a shift in the
structure of imported goods so that the previously dominant
consumer goods have been replaced by raw materials and
semi-manufactures. The shortage of goods for export, however, is
one of the causes for the low trade with the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslav economists underscored the need for creating more
favorable conditions to boost foreign trade and encourage exports
in the country.

ensuring of freedom of movement, cooperation with the International
Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, return of refugees, and

ZAGREB, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Bosnian Muslims and Croats today
failed to meet a deadline on the organization of Sarajevo, which
was required by the latest agreement to shore up their alliance.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement signed on March 30, Bosnian federation
president Kresimir Zubak and his deputy Ejup Ganic, both of whom
were signatories, had to submit a draft agreement on the

<P>
In a letter to international mediator Michael Steiner, Zubak
said that workings groups consisting of officials from both sides
"have held several meetings, but no agreement was reached."
</P>
<P>
"I personally believe the former Sarajevo area should be
arranged as a canton, but with a specific internal organization
and work of authorities, which would reflect the fact that it is
the seat of the Bosnian Federation and Republic," the letter said.
</P>
<P>
Zubak and other Croats have accused the Muslim side of
organizing Sarajevo into a canton with a Muslim majority so as to
dominate the politics of the city. The Croats want to create a
